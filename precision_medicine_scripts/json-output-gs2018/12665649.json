Although the concept of a hybrid carcinoma of the thyroid is intellectually very appealing, we conclude that there is not (yet) enough reliable genotypic or phenotypic evidence to support utilization of such a term.","title":"Follicular, papillary, and \"hybrid\" carcinomas of the thyroid.","pubmedId":"12665649"}
