Genetic characterization of a predominant V600E mutation in melanoma, thyroid cancer, and other tumors became a focus for developing specific inhibitors, such as vemurafenib or dabrafenib. Our knowledge regarding the role of mutated BRAF in hematological malignancies has grown quickly as a result of new genetic techniques such as next-generation sequencing. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the role of BRAF in lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms, with a focus on hairy-cell leukemia, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and Erdheim-Chester disease.
