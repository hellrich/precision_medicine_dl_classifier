The aim of this study is to perform genomic and RNA profiling of acral melanoma to obtain the comprehensive genomic view of this subtype of melanoma. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted with Qiagen DNeasy Blood or Tissue Kit . DNA libraries were prepared using a CancerPROTM-P88 BOX library Prep kit and sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq X10. RNA was isolated with Qiagen RNeasy mini-spin column. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system . RNA libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit and sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq X10. Results: To obtain a comprehensive genomic and functional genomic view of acral melanoma, we sequenced the genomes of 14 acral melanoma and transcriptomes of 11 of these melanoma samples. We found a new mutation in the V28 codon of BRAF in three patients. Furthermore, we identified recurrent non-synonymous single nucleotide variants in previously described oncogene NRAS, as well as in genes encoding keratin associated proteins (KRTAP4-7, KRTAP4-5) and mucin (MUC2, MUC21). Notably, a recurrent noncoding hotspot mutation was discovered in 4 of 11 cases. By analyzing the RNA sequencing data, we found significant divergence on transcriptome between patients with or without ulcer. In total, we identified 201 genes were significantly up-regulated and 386 genes significantly down-regulated in acral melanoma patients with ulcer. Differentially expressed genes were enriched in pathways associated with cancers, melanogenesis, cell death signaling, skin diseases, etc. Conclusions: Our study reveals potentially different driver mutations and distinct transcriptome in acral melanoma patients compared with cutaneous melanoma patients and sheds lights to the further personalized medicine for acral melanoma patients.","title":"Whole genome and RNA sequencing reveal the distinct genomic landscape of acral melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_189273-199"}
