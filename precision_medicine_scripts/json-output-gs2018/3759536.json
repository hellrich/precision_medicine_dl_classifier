On review, three groups were identified based on presentation and treatment. Group I consists of 19 patients treated with curative intent. They all presented with cervical adenopathy, 11 patients with N1 disease, 2 with Stage N2A disease, 1 with Stage N2B disease, 4 with N3A disease, and 1 with unknown stage. The majority of patients were treated with portals encompassing the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and neck to a dose of 5000 rad followed by boosts of 1000-1500 rad. The overall 2-year NED survival in this group was 63% (12/19). The most significant prognostic factor was the stage of the metastatic nodes. The NED survival rate for the 14 patients with Stage N1 and N2 was 86% (12/14). Histology of the lesions was not an important factor in the outcome. In Group II there are six patients who received palliative treatment because of large, fixed, cervical nodes. Three of these patients (50%) died within 2 months of completion of treatment. Group III consists of six patients who presented with supraclavicular adenopathy. All had persistent or recurrent disease within 19 months. We have concluded that in patients with metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown primary, radiation therapy to the neck and suspected areas of primary disease may play an important role in cure, particularly in early stage disease.","title":"Metastatic carcinoma of the neck from an unknown primary.","pubmedId":"3759536"}
