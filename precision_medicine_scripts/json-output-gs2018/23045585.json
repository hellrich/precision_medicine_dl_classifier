Long-term outcomes of chemotherapy-treated adults are not definitively established and should be evaluated.\nPatients treated in three Groupe d\u0027Étude des Lymphomes de l\u0027Adulte prospective clinical trials with confirmed systemic ALCL after immunohistopathologic review and defined ALK expression status were analyzed.\nAmong the 138 adult patients with ALCL, 64 (46%) were ALK positive, and 74 (54%) were ALK negative. Median follow-up was 8 years. At diagnosis, significantly more patients younger than 40 years old were ALK positive than ALK negative (66% v 23%, respectively; P \u003c .001). Comparing patients with ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL, β(2)-microglobulin was ≥ 3 mg/L in 12% and 33% (P \u003d .017); International Prognostic Index was high (score, 3 to 5) in 23% and 48% (P \u003d .03); complete response rates to first-line treatment were 86% and 68% (P \u003d .01); and 8-year overall survival (OS) rates were 82% (95% CI, 69% to 89%) and 49% (95% CI, 37% to 61%), respectively (P \u003c .001). The survival difference mostly affected patients age ≥ 40 years. Multivariate analysis identified β(2)-microglobulin ≥ 3 mg/L (P \u003c .001) and age ≥ 40 years (P \u003d .029), but not ALK status, as prognostic for OS. These two variables distinguished four survival risk groups, with 8-year OS ranging from 84% to 22%. CONCLUSION Results of this long-term study enabled refinement of the prognosis of adult systemic ALCL, with ALK prognostic value dependent on age, and could provide guidance for eventual treatment adjustment.","title":"Long-term outcome of adults with systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma treated within the Groupe d\u0027Etude des Lymphomes de l\u0027Adulte trials.","pubmedId":"23045585"}
