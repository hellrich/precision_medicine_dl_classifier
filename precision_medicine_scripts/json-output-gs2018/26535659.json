The proliferation and apoptosis of ACC-M cells after treatment with different concentrations of GAA were detected using Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. DNMT1 mRNA expression was measured by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The growth of ACC-M cells was inhibited after treatment with GAA for 24, 48, and 72 h. The apoptotic rates of ACC-M cells after treatment with GAA for 72 h were higher than those of control cells (without treatment) (P \u003c 0.05). DNMT1 mRNA expression in ACC-M after treatment with GAA for 72 h was lower than that in control cells (P \u003c 0.05). GAA had inhibitory effects on the proliferation and induced apoptosis of human ACC-M cells, while GAA also reduced the expression level of DNMT1 mRNA in ACC-M cells.","title":"Influence of gossypol acetic acid on the growth of human adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC-M cells and the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1.","pubmedId":"26535659"}
