There was a significant difference in the positive rates of gene promoter methylation between normal GFE and GC tissue (P \u003d 0.0001). There was a significant association with Laurén classification, degree of differentiation and pTNM staging in GC (P \u003c 0.05), but no significant association with Ming\u0027s classification (P \u003e 0.05).\nTumor suppressor genes promoter methylation is frequently present in GC and adjacent normal gastric foveolar epithelium, especially in Laurén diffuse type GC, poorly differentiated GC, mucus-secreting (signet ring) cell GC and pTNM stage III and IV GC. Our findings indicate that the gene promoter methylation is a common and early event in GC carcinogensis.","title":"[Frequent promoter hypermethylation of several tumor suppressor genes in gastric carcinoma and foveolar epithelium].","pubmedId":"18069630"}
