Thus, we compared the degree of somatization in young versus older female patients with panic disorder to ascertain whether similarly high levels of somatization exist in older panic disorder patients.\nCommunity-dwelling subjects were recruited for clinical trials for panic disorder and met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R) criteria for panic disorder as a primary diagnosis. Our sample (N \u003d 64) contained 42 younger females (\u003c 55 years of age; age range 21-54, mean age 34.6) who were compared to 22 older females (\u003e or \u003d 55 years of age; age range 55-73, mean age 60.8). Subjects were evaluated at baseline using the Self-Report Inventory for Somatic Symptoms (SISS). Statistical analysis of total somatization disorder scores (TSDS) was accomplished by t-tests for independent groups.\nOlder patients showed statistically significantly higher total somatization disorder scores (TSDS) (X \u003d 11.54, SD \u003d 7.45) than did younger patients (X \u003d 8.07, SD \u003d 4.77; t(62) \u003d 2.27, p \u003d \u003c 0.05).\nOur results are suggestive of a higher degree of somatization in older compared to younger female panic disorder patients.","title":"Somatization in young versus older female panic disorder patients.","pubmedId":"9733338"}
