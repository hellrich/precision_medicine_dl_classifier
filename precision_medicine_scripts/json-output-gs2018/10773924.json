Neuroblastoma is the most intriguing pediatric neoplasm displaying diverse clinical and biologic characteristics and natural history. It has the highest rate of spontaneous regression of all human cancers, yet exhibits extremely malignant behaviour in older children with regional and disseminated disease. In the last 30 years, only a nominal improvement has occurred in the outlook of older children with metastatic disease at diagnosis. Tremendous gains in understanding of the biology of neuroblastoma in recent years have led to development of risk-related therapy based on age, stage and biological characteristics of neuroblastoma.","title":"Neuroblastoma.","pubmedId":"10773924"}
