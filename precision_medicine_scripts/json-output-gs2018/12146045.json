The outlook is dismal unless lesional tissue is limited to the esophageal wall. Hence, staging prior to extensive surgical intervention is desirable.\nA 54-year-old male presented with fatigue and melena. A diagnosis of MM primary in the esophagus was rendered on a biopsy of an esophageal polyp. The stage, determined by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy, was advanced. On the basis of this information, it was decided to spare the patient mutilating surgery.\nThis report confirms the utility of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy in documenting the extent of lesions at sites difficult to access. Thus, management can be improved.","title":"Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy for staging malignant melanoma of the esophagus. A case report.","pubmedId":"12146045"}
