A hemorrhagic black tumor and surrounding tan-colored flat lesions were observed at the distal urethra on urethroscopy. Atypical cells consistent with malignant melanoma were noted in urinary cytologic samples. Total penectomy and prostatectomy were performed with negative surgical margin. Because of negative sentinel biopsy of inguinal lymph nodes, further lymph nodes exploration was omitted. However, recurrent tumors at the perineal region and metastases to pelvic lymph nodes appeared four months after surgery, and he died eleven months later.","title":"[Primary malignant melanoma of the male urethra: a case report].","pubmedId":"18516927"}
