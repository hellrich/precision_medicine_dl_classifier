We report here that, except for cells of the macrophage lineage, normal human tissues do not express B7-H1. In contrast, B7-H1 is abundant in human carcinomas of lung, ovary and colon and in melanomas. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma upregulates B7-H1 on the surface of tumor cell lines. Cancer cell-associated B7-H1 increases apoptosis of antigen-specific human T-cell clones in vitro, and the apoptotic effect of B7-H1 is mediated largely by one or more receptors other than PD-1. In addition, expression of B7-H1 on mouse P815 tumor increases apoptosis of activated tumor-reactive T cells and promotes the growth of highly immunogenic B7-1(+) tumors in vivo. These findings have implications for the design of T cell-based cancer immunotherapy.","title":"Tumor-associated B7-H1 promotes T-cell apoptosis: a potential mechanism of immune evasion.","pubmedId":"12091876"}
