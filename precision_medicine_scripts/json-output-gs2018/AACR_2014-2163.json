Body size and weight change in adulthood were examined as the potential risk factors for thyroid cancer development.METHODS: A large scale case-control study was conducted with constructed questionnaire for their height, weight (current, 2 years ago, at the age of 20 and 35 years old) and confounders. Medical charts were reviewed for cancer histology, tumor aggressiveness and BRAF mutation status. A total of 2,003 cases (1,611 females and 392 males) and individually matched 17,700 controls (13,983 females and 3,717 males) by age, sex, 12-year education and birth year were included. Logistic regression model were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).RESULTS: Having a tall height and heavy weight was associated with increased risk in both females [OR and 95%CI for height and weight: 1.46 (1.25-1.71) and 2.66 (2.24-3.15), respectably] and males [OR and 95%CI for height and weight: 1.71 (1.25-2.34) and 2.80 (2.00-3.92), respectably] compared to those in the lowest quartile for the body sizes. This study observed approximated tripled the risk of thyroid cancer [OR and 95%CI: 3.03 (2.10-4.37)] when female subjects gained 10kg or more within recent 2 years. Males who gained 10 kg or more after 35 years old were more likely to have a greater tumor size [\u003c1cm vs. 1cm: 3.76 (2.62-5.38) vs. 6.87 (4.38-10.77)]. However, other factors were not significantly related to increased tumor aggressiveness (tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and mutlifocality) and BRAF mutation affected carriers.CONCLUSION: The results support plausible hormonal and metabolic factors related height, weight, and rapid weight gain in adulthood increase thyroid carcinogenesis.","title":"Height, weight and weight changes during adulthood and thyroid cancer risk","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2163"}
