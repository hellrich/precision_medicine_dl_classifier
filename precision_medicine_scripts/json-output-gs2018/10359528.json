Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis, which allows detection of DNA sequence copy changes, was applied to one of the tumors and it was found that there were increased copy numbers of sequences at chromosome 4q12-q21 in this tumor. We have previously determined that the loci for the hepatocyte growth factor (Hgf) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Hgfr/Met), a protooncogene, are situated in this particular chromosome region. Using probes for the two genes in FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) and in Southern blots we found that the Hgfr/Met gene was amplified in five of the 19 sarcomas studied, and that the Hgf gene was coamplified in two of them. Northern and Western blots and tyrosine phosphorylation analysis showed that the HGF receptor was overexpressed and functional in all five tumors, as well as in two additional tumors. In summary, both amplification and overexpression of the Hgfr/Met gene was found in about 25% of DMBA-induced experimental rat sarcomas, and HGF receptor overexpression alone was seen in two additional tumors. Possibly this reflects an involvement in paracrine or autocrine stimulation of growth and invasiveness by HGF. Our finding could provide a rodent model system to increased knowledge about causality and therapy, which may be applicable to the sizeable fraction of human musculoskeletal tumors displaying MET overexpression.","title":"Amplification and overexpression of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR/MET) in rat DMBA sarcomas.","pubmedId":"10359528"}
