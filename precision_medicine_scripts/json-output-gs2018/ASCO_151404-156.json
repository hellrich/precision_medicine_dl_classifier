The aim of this analysis was to determine the overall survival (OS) of pts treated with both agents sequentially in this population.  Methods:  This was a retrospective, single-institution analysis of pts treated with BRAFi (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) and IT (ipilimumab, pembrolizumab or nivolumab) as part of a clinical trial, expanded access program or via commercial use. Eligible patients were positive for the BRAFV600 mutation and had sequentially received treatment with BRAFi followed by IT (cohort A), or vice versa (cohort B). Response rate (RR), according to immune-related response criteria for IT and to RECIST v1.1 for BRAFi, OS and survival rates, upon both sequences were evaluated. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze patient baseline characteristics. Median follow-up were compared by U Mann-Whitney test. RR were compared by exact Fisher test. OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:  A total of 23 pts were eligible, 14 pts received BRAFi prior to IT (cohort A); and 9 pts, IT followed by BRAFi (cohort B). No differences were found in baseline characteristics between each cohort before the start of either treatment. Median follow-up were 16.8 and 26.5 months (p \u003d.791) for cohorts A and B, respectively. Pts treated with a BRAFi before or after progression to IT showed similar RR (71 vs 78%, p \u003d 1.00). Nine pts treated first with IT showed no response compared to 6 pts treated with IT after a BRAFi (0 vs 43%, p \u003d 0.048). Median OS for cohort A was 31 months and not reached for B (with only 4 events reported). Seventy-six versus 89% of pts were alive at 12 months in cohort A and B; and 54 and 51% at 24 months in cohort A and B, respectively.  Conclusions:  This study suggests that BRAFi induce a similar RR independently of the sequence of treatment administered. Administration of a BRAFi prior to IT may enhance response to IT. Most importantly it suggests  that BRAFi and IT are optimal first-line options in pts with BRAFV600MM based on similar long term outcomes.","title":"Clinical outcomes in BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma with sequential treatment with immunotherapy and BRAF inhibitors or vice versa.","pubmedId":"ASCO_151404-156"}
