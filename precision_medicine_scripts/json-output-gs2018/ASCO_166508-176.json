{"publicationTypes":["2016 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: There is increasing interest in immunotherapy as a treatment for cancer with multiple agents studied in various solid tumors. CPIs activate the host immune system against tumor cells; as a consequence of this mechanism of action, treatment-related adverse events (AEs) can occur. We hypothesized that occurrence of AEs is associated with longer survival. Methods: A systematic review of MEDLINE (from inception until December 2015) identified randomized studies reporting the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) as well as data on safety which allowed the calculation of the odds of AEs comparing experimental therapy to control. Safety and tolerability outcomes of interest were treatment discontinuation without progressive disease, grade 3/4 AEs as well as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). If reported, irAEs were extracted from manuscripts. Otherwise, irAEs were assumed to comprise colitis or diarrhea, increased transaminases or endocrinopathy (hypophysitis, thyroiditis, pancreatitis). The association between AEs and OS was explored using metaregression (simple linear regression weighted by sample size). Results: Of 130 articles identified initially, 18 met inclusion criteria. Included trials were all published after 2009 and explored CPIs in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, non-small cell and small cell lung cancers. CPIs studied were ipilimumab (n \u003d 12), pembrolizumab (n \u003d 2), and nivolumab (n \u003d 7). There were non-significant positive associations between treatment discontinuation without progressive disease, grade 3/4 AEs, and irAEs, with worse survival (see Table). Conclusions: AEs with CPIs do not predict for improved OS. Positive associations between the odds of AEs and the HR for OS suggest that prolonged exposure to immunotherapeutics may be beneficial.
