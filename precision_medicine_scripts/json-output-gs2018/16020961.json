Median follow-up was 51 months (range 2-76). In the univariate analysis, under treatment S-100 \u003e or \u003d0.15 microg/l and a positive RT-PCR correlated with a lower disease-free survival and overall survival (OS). In the multivariate analysis, clinical stage, under therapy positive RT-PCR and S-100 levels \u003e or \u003d0.15 mug/ml, were independent prognostic factors for OS. The hazard ratio for OS was 3.9 (95% CI, 1.67-9.15; p \u003d 0.004) and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.05-4.6; p \u003d 0.016) for S-100 \u003e or \u003d0.15 microg/l and positive RT-PCR, respectively. When both techniques where combined, a positive RT-PCR indicated a poorer clinical outcome only in patients with S-100 \u003c0.15 microg/l.\nS-100 \u003e or \u003d0.15 microg/l and a positive RT-PCR during adjuvant interferon therapy indicate a high risk of death in resected melanoma patients. S-100 determination has a higher positive predictive value than RT-PCR, while tyrosinase RT-PCR adds prognostic information in patients with S-100 \u003c0.15 microg/l.","title":"Serum protein s-100 predicts clinical outcome in patients with melanoma treated with adjuvant interferon--comparison with tyrosinase rt-PCR.","pubmedId":"16020961"}
