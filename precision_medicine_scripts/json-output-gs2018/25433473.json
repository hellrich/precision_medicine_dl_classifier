Twenty-four healthy individuals were also recruited as control group. After blood and urine sampling, total RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized. Expression of PCA3 gene was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\nComparison of PCA3 gene expression between control and BPH groups indicated no statistically significant differences in both urine and blood samples. Patients with PCa demonstrated an increased PCA3 gene expression rate compared to control and BPH groups (10.64 and 7.17 folds, respectively). The rate of fold increased PCA3 gene expression in urine was 20.90, 20.90, and 20.35 in patients with PCa, BPH and normal subjects, respectively.\nEvaluation of PCA3 gene expression can be considered as a reliable marker for detection of PCa. Increased level of this marker in urine sediments is more sensitive than blood for distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous groups.\u0026nbsp;","title":"Prostate cancer antigen 3 gene expression in peripheral blood and urine sediments from prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia patients versus healthy individuals.","pubmedId":"25433473"}
