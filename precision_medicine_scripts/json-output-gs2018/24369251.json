CDK6 was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm in nasopharyngeal tissues, but in NPC tissues, CDK6 was co-expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm and nuclei. Compared to the nasopharyngeal tissues, NPC tissues showed significantly up-regulated CDK6 expression (P\u003d0.009) in positive correlation with tumor size (P\u003d0.020) and clinical stages (P\u003d0.0039).\nIncreased CDK6 protein expression is an unfavorable factor that promotes the development and progression of NPC.","title":"[Expression of CDK6 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and its clinical significance].","pubmedId":"24369251"}
