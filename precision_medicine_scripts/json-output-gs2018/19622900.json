This study aimed to identify the clinical picture and outcome of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients with pulmonary embolism (PE).\nFrom 1996 to 2005, the clinical presentation of lung cancer patients with PE was evaluated. Their survival was compared with matched controls by log-rank test.\nA total of 24 patients, 17 men (70.8%) and 7 women (median age: 62.5 years), were identified. Nineteen patients (79.2%) initially presented with advanced lung cancer (16 stage IV, 1 stage III-b NSCLC and 2 extensive-stage SCLC). Wells\u0027 clinical prediction score for PE only predicted moderate probability (median: 5.25). In patients with PE, survival was significantly shorter than in matched control patients (243.5 vs. 327 days, p \u003d 0.01). This difference was more significant when PE presented concomitant with cancer (p \u003d 0.003) than when PE developed during cancer treatment (p \u003d 0.206).\nPE is an important event in lung cancer patients which usually occurs in advanced disease and affects survival. In patients presenting PE at the initial diagnosis of cancer, the prognosis was the worst.","title":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of lung cancer with pulmonary embolism.","pubmedId":"19622900"}
