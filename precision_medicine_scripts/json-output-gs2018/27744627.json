Using a liver cancer model induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) which mimics the process from liver injury, abnormal hepatocyte proliferation, and hepatocirrhosis to hepatocyte canceration, we investigated the abnormal activation of the Shh pathway by examining the expression of Shh, patched-1 (Ptch), smoothened (SMO), and glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli1) genes. During this process, the expression of CDK1 and cyclin B1 protein, which are two components of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF) controlling G2/M transition, was also examined to explore the potential relationship between Shh activation and cell cycle progression. We observed that the cells with Shh, Ptch, and Gli1 protein expression were mainly distributed in hyperplastic nodule, cancerous node, the epithelia of interlobular bile duct, and precancerous tissues. A gradually increasing tendency of the positive expression rate of Shh, Ptch, and Gli1 proteins in the process from the beginning normal tissue to the final cancer formation was revealed. The cyclin B1 and CDK1 expression level was higher in the DEN-induced rats as compared with normal rats, and their expression was mainly distributed in the portal area of the liver, hyperplastic nodule, cancerous node, and precancerous tissues. Our results suggested that the Shh signaling pathway is activated during liver carcinogenesis, and activated Shh signaling promotes the cell proliferation by facilitating the G2/M transition through increasing the expression of cyclin B1 and CDK1 protein, which eventually results in the development of liver cancer. Better understanding of the Shh signaling pathway in HCC may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies in inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell cycle arrest.","title":"Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway mediates development of hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"27744627"}
