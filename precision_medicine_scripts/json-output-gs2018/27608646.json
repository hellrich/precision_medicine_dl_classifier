Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2) followed by ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) on Day 1 of 21-day cycles. Recommended dose was defined as \u003c33% dose-limiting toxicities in dose-limiting toxicity-evaluable patients in Cycle 1. The safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and antitumor activity were examined.\nSeven patients were treated. Most adverse events were mild to moderate. Two patients during Cycle 1 experienced a dose-limiting toxicity; one patient each experienced Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and Grade 3 gingivitis. Both dose-limiting toxicities subsequently resolved. No patients discontinued study therapies during Cycle 1. Four serious adverse events were possibly related to ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel. Anti-ramucirumab antibodies were not detected. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed low total body clearance and long apparent terminal elimination half-life (~7-12 days). Partial response was reported in four patients.\nThe combination of ramucirumab and docetaxel was tolerable in female Japanese patients with breast cancer. Ramucirumab 10 mg/kg in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m2) was confirmed as the recommended dose among Japanese patients, supporting its use in future studies.","title":"Safety and pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel in Japanese patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: a Phase Ib study.","pubmedId":"27608646"}
