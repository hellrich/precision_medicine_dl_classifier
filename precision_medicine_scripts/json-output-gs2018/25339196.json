A considerable divergence in the spectrum of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides was noted at the cell line level. The unification of genotype-specific cell line data revealed the enrichment for the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoskeletal proteins to be associated with the presence of a BRAF mutation and oncogenic NRAS to be associated with increased receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. A number of proteins including cell cycle regulators (cyclin dependent kinase 1, cyclin dependent kinase 2, and cyclin dependent kinase 3), MAPK pathway components (Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and Extracellular signal regulated kinase 2), interferon regulators (tyrosine kinase-2), GTPase regulators (Ras-Rasb interactor 1), and controllers of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (dual specificity tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type A) were common to all genotypes. Treatment of a BRAF-mutant/phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) null melanoma cell line with vemurafenib led to decreased phosphorylation of ERK, phospholipase C1, and β-catenin with increases in receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, signal transduction and activator of signaling 3, and glycogen synthase kinase 3α noted. In NRAS-mutant melanoma, MEK inhibition led to increased phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway components, Src family kinases, and protein kinase Cδ with decreased phosphorylation seen in STAT3 and ERK1/2. Together these data present the first systems level view of adaptive and basal phosphotyrosine signaling in BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma.
