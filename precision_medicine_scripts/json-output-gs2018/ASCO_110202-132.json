Methods:  Recombinant adenoviral human p53 gene (rAd-p53), was given intravenously at a dose of 21012 viral particles /day on 5 consecutive days one week before routine anti-cancer treatment start, and was repeated after an interval of 16 days. The inclusion criteria include: 1.Pathologically confirmed recurrent cancers; 2. Disseminated cases; 3. Patients with key organ metastasis; 4.Unresectable lesions; 5.Chemo- or radio-therapy resistant cases. The exclusion criteria include: 1.With severe liver, kidney, heart or hemotologic disorders; 2.Pregnancy; 3.Without informed consent.  Efficacy was evaluated according to the results of contrasted MRI or CT.  Results:  A total of 16 patients entered the study with a median age of 59 years old (range 30-76 years), 13 were male and 3 were female. 5 were recurrent cases(4 HNSCC and 1 esophageal cancer), 5 were widely infiltrated unresectable HNSCC, esophageal carcinoma(2 cases) and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma(1 case). 3 were disseminated cases(2 NPC and 1 Lung cancer). Two cases were breast cancer with multiple brain metastasis. One was refractory central nervous lymphoma. One patient did not finish the planned chemoradiation due to radiation-induced pneumotitis. Another one patient experienced chemotherapy delay due to A grade 4 hemotologic toxicity. 93.8% patients had shivering and fever after injection of rAd-p53. Other acute toxicities during the treatment included: leukopenia(Grade 3/4) 43.8%, thrombocytopenia (Grade 3/4) 25.0%, oral mucositis(Grade 3/4) 18.8%, vomiting(Grade 2 and above) 31.3%, ALT elevation (Grade 2 and above) 6.3%. No Cr elevation was observed. The acute toxicities were controllable and reversible. At the 3 months after treatment, PR, SD and PD rate were 56.3%, 25.0% and 18.7%, respectively.  Conclusions:    The therapeutic p53 gene agent can be intravenously safely added to routine anti-cancer regimens with controllable and reversible acute toxicities. A randomized controlled phase II is needed to make clear the role of the therapeutic p53 gene agent.","title":"Therapeutic p53 gene agent in the treatment of refractory cancer cases: A phase I study.","pubmedId":"ASCO_110202-132"}
