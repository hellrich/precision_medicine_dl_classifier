However, since MTC is a neuroendocrine neoplasm, we considered the possibility that cytotoxic drugs previously used in the treatment of these tumours could also have activity in MTC.\nFive patients (4 females and 1 male, aged 22-71 years) with locally advanced or metastatic MTC received 5 day intravenous courses of dacarbazine (DTIC) (250 mg/sqm) and 12 hour infusion 5-fluorouracil (450 mg/sqm), given every 4 weeks. Six cycles were administered to 4 patients and four to 1 patient.\nThree partial responses lasting 9, 10+ and 8+ months were observed; one patient had stable disease and one progressive disease. Toxicity was acceptable with grade I thrombocytopenia and grade II leukopenia occurring in one patient, and grade II nausea and vomiting in four patients.\nIn our experience, treatment of advanced thyroid carcinoma with DTIC and 5-FU appeared to have significant activity and was well tolerated.","title":"Chemotherapy with dacarbazine and 5-fluorouracil in advanced medullary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"7826911"}
