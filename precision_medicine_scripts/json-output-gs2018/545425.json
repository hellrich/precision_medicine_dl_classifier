The resultant figure was called the melanoma adjustment score. Twenty-nine patients who relapsed within 1 year of surgery reported a score of 53 +/- 31 (mean +/- SD); 35 nonrelapsers reported a score of 80 +/- 20, p less than 0.001. Based upon analysis of indivual melanoma adjustment scores in the first 31 patients, we predicted that subjects scoring greater or equal to 65 would stay in remission, whereas those scoring greater than 65 would relapse. Applying this prospectively to the next 33 patients we correctly identified 25 of 33 outcomes (76%), p less than 0.03. This psychological variable was independent of known biological prognostic factors, which did not predict 1 year survival. The melanoma adjustment score was also independent of the number of positive lymph nodes, which did correlate with outcome in these patients. The results suggest a role for psychological factors in the one year prognosis of this malignancy.","title":"Psychological factors in the prognosis of malignant melanoma: a prospective study.","pubmedId":"545425"}
