The molecular basis of SERM activity involves binding of the ligand SERM to the estrogen receptor (ER), causing conformational changes which facilitate interactions with coactivator or corepressor proteins, and subsequently initiate or suppress transcription of target genes. SERM activity is intrinsic to each ER ligand, which accomplishes its unique profile by specific interactions in the target cell, leading to tissue selective actions. We discuss the estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects of early SERMs, such as clomiphene citrate, used for treatment of ovulation induction, and the triphenylethylene, tamoxifen, which has ER antagonist activity in the breast, and is used for prevention and treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. Since the development of tamoxifen, other triphenylethylene SERMs have been studied for breast cancer prevention, including droloxifene, idoxifene, toremifene, and ospemifene. Other SERMs have entered clinical development more recently, including benzothiophenes (raloxifene and arzoxifene), benzopyrans (ormeloxifene, levormeloxifene, and EM-800), lasofoxifene, pipendoxifene, bazedoxifene, HMR-3339, and fulvestrant, an anti-estrogen which is approved for breast cancer treatment. SERMs have effects on tissues containing ER, such as the breast, bone, uterine and genitourinary tissues, and brain, and on markers of cardiovascular risk. Current evidence indicates that each SERM has a unique array of clinical activities. Differences in the patterns of action of SERMs suggest that each clinical end point must be evaluated individually, and conclusions about any particular SERM can only be established through appropriate clinical trials.","title":"Selective estrogen receptor modulators: an update on recent clinical findings.","pubmedId":"18279543"}
