Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric and over 50% of adult ALL patients fail to achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most significant challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole exome sequencing, here we identify mutations in NT5C2, a 5-nucleotidase enzyme responsible for inactivation of nucleoside analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T-ALLs and in 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs analyzed. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL.","title":"Activating mutations in the NT5C2 nucleotidase gene drive chemotherapy resistance in relapsed ALL.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-4595"}
