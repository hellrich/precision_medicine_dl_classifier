There are gender differences in the incidence of PTC being mainly observed in females. Low-risk groups consisted of men younger than 40-year-old and women younger than 50-year-old, whereas the high-risk group are older patients. We believe that age is not enough to explain the clinical course of this neoplasm and hypothesize that aggressive behavior of D-PTC may be correlated with hormonal status. Studies that support this idea showed that the follicular neoplastic cells had higher estrogen receptor-alpha in premenopausal (28.1+/-4.5) than in postmenopausal women (14.2+/-2.9). According to author\u0027s prior observations, there are evidences correlating recurrence of D-PTC with postmenopause in women. Postmenopause status is characterized by estrogen decrease and FSH increases both associated with EGFR activation. Previous observations identified EGFR over-expression in D-PTC of postmenopause when compared with premenopausal ladies.\nPostmenopause is an adverse factor for tumor evolution in women with D-PTC and is associated with EGFR expression. It\u0027s introduction in thyroid tumor stratification could be a fine tuning in predicting papillary thyroid carcinoma behavior.","title":"Postmenopause is associated with recurrence of differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17412519"}
