Preplanned analyses of the influence of tumor biomarkers on treatment outcome were carried out.\nPatients received weekly cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) on day 1, subsequently 250 mg/m(2)) plus irinotecan (80 mg/m(2)) and a 24-hour continuous infusion of folinic acid (200 mg/m(2)) and 5-FU (1500 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36 of a 50-day cycle, until progressive disease (PD).\nThe most common grade 3/4 toxic effects in 49 patients were diarrhea (15%) and skin toxic effects (14%). In 48 assessable patients, the overall response rate was 46% and disease control rate was 79%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 9.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.1-15.6] and 16.5 months (95% CI 11.7-30.1), respectively. Tumor response was more common than nonresponse in epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing tumors (P \u003d 0.041). Tumor PTEN expression was associated with longer PFS (P \u003d 0.035) and OS (P \u003d 0.0127) than no PTEN expression.\nCetuximab plus IF was well tolerated and efficacy data were encouraging. This treatment combination and the role of selected biomarkers are under investigation in the ongoing phase III EXPAND trial.","title":"Cetuximab with irinotecan, folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil as first-line treatment in advanced gastroesophageal cancer: a prospective multi-center biomarker-oriented phase II study.","pubmedId":"21119032"}
