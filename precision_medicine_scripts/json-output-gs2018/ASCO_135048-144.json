The prevalence of germline BAP1 mutations in unselected patients with MM remains uncertain.   Methods:   Unselected patients with MM were enrolled prospectively  to collect germline DNA, detailed family history, exposure questionnaires, and tumor tissue if available. De-identified germline DNA sequencing was performed using a custom AmpliSeq panel including BAP1, sequenced on an IonTorrent PGM using Hi-Q chemistry. The sequence data were analyzed for point mutations and small indels using a custom pipeline. Patients with prespecified high-risk criteria (age \u003c50 yrs, no asbestos exposure, personal/family history of choroidal nevus, uveal melanoma, melanoma, or mesothelioma, or cancer in  two 1st degree relatives) were offered genetic counseling and clinical BAP1 testing in a CLIA laboratory.   Results:   23 of the 100 planned pts with MM have been tested. In this cohort, 15 (65%) were male, the median age was 69 yrs, 17 (74%) had occupational exposure to asbestos, and 10 had a personal history of another malignancy (including 2 with prior melanoma). 20 pts had pleural MM, 3 pts had peritoneal MM. 20 pts had epithelioid histology, 3 had other histologies.  9 pts qualified as high-risk. One patient was found to be heterozygous for a novel missense variant (E306K) of uncertain functional significance. This pt had asbestos exposure and 5 first-degree relatives with cancer (1 stomach, 4 lung). Studies are ongoing to assess the functional significance of this rare sequence variant. If this variant is shown to be pathogenic, germ line BAP1mutations will account for 1 in 23 unselected pts with MM (4%, 95% CI 0-22%) and 1 in 9 in high-risk pts (11%, 95% 0-48%).  Conclusions:   Germline BAP1 mutations are uncommon in unselected patients with MM. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of BAP1 in the oncogenesis of MM and to identify subsets of patients with significant BAP1 mutation prevelance.
