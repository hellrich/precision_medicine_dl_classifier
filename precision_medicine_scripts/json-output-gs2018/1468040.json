The tumor is composed of both carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements. The multiple designations of names such as pseudosarcoma, pseudosarcomatous carcinoma, polypoid carcinoma etc. reflect the controversy on the nature of sarcomatous component of this lesion. We report a case of carcinosarcoma of esophagus occurred in a 67 year old male with progressive dysphagia. Esophageal polypoid tumor was found by endoscopy and was resected by esophagectomy. Carcinosarcoma was proved by demonstrating both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components in the tumor. Immunohistochemical studies revealed positive keratin stain in the sarcomatous area and positive vimentin stain in the sarcomatous area. The tumor was reported to have a better prognosis than that of the squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus in the literatures, especially in the survival rate.","title":"Carcinosarcoma of esophagus.
