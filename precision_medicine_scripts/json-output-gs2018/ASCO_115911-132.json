While several genetic resistance effectors have been identified, a comprehensive assessment of the genetic resistance spectrum in a large patient cohort may further inform resistance patterns and treatment strategies.  Methods:  Pre-treatment and post-relapse biopsies were obtained from BRAFV600melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib or dabrafenib. Whole exome sequencing of tumor and normal samples was performed to identify exome-wide mutations, insertion/deletions, and chromosomal copy number alterations. Since somatic allelic fraction comparisons across treatment time points must account for variable stromal admixture between biopsies, novel algorithms were applied to impute purity and tumor cell ploidy, thus determining the cancer cell fraction (CCF) of each alteration. Those with enriched CCF in post-relapse samples were nominated as potential resistance effectors.  Results:  30 patients (towards a goal of 77) were sequenced to a mean depth of 145-fold coverage. In acquired resistance patients (on drug  12 weeks, n\u003d18), NRAS Q61R (28%) and BRAF amplifications (6%) were observed. The remaining patients had multiple clonally enriched alterations in the post-relapse tumors that may drive resistance, including MEK1 mutations at residues previously noted in an in vitro mutagenesis screen for vemurafenib resistance. In the intrinsic resistance cohort (on drug \u003c 12 weeks, n\u003d12), multiple putative resistance mutations not previously observed in the setting of acquired resistance were identified.  Conclusions:  In addition to reported genetic resistance mechanisms, we identified new MEK1 mutations in resistant samples. For the majority of patients (67%) without events in these genes, computational algorithms identified new candidate drivers of RAF inhibitor resistance. Alterations that predict intrinsic or acquired resistance may also inform new approaches to melanoma therapy. Future studies incorporating longitudinal biopsies and genetic profiling will underpin a robust assessment of clinical resistance in melanoma and other cancers.","title":"The genetic landscape of clinical resistance to RAF inhibition in melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_115911-132"}
