A number of immunologic studies suggest that there may be a specific immune response to melanoma-associated antigens in patients with melanoma; however, other studies have shown lack of specificity, so this issue remains to be definitively resolved. New immunotherapeutic agents, including BCG, TF, and levamisole, among others, offer the potential for improving therapy for patients.","title":"Malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"787436"}
