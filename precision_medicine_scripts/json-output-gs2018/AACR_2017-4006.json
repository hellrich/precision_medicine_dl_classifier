Transcriptomes were generated from tumor cores using Illumina DASL HT 12.4 array. In the obtained tumor subgroups with differing immune profiles, we tested the hypothesis that β-catenin signaling controls immune suppression in primary tumors as earlier reported in vitro and murine data2.ResultsWe found and validated 6 tumor classes, which showed consistency with other published gene signatures, and predicted melanoma-specific survival (HR\u003d1.8, P\u003d0.003, adjusted for AJCC stage, site, age, sex, ulceration, mitotic rate, BRAF/NRAS mutation). Tumors of good prognosis expressed markedly a large number of markers of T cell cytotoxicity, dendritic cells, macrophages, NK CD56 dim cells and genes coding for checkpoint co-inhibitor molecules (Table 1). They also had upregulation of β-catenin suppressors3 and downregulated β-catenin itself (Table 1). By contrast, poor prognosis tumors (the largest group) lacked both innate and adaptive immunity, and had activation of canonical β-catenin signaling (CTNNB1, its targets and WNT receptors) and WNT-independent β-catenin signaling (Table 1).ConclusionIn a large subset of this population-based cohort of primary tumors, we report evidence of immune evasion through β-catenin signaling pathway. These results obtained from archival material suggest that transcriptomic profiling is a viable alternative to flow cytometry in understanding tumor biology and in determining the effectiveness of immunotherapies.Table 1.
