The goal of this study is it determine TCR usage by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against AM.\nCTL were generated from three patients using lymphocytes from metastatic or tumor-draining lymph nodes by repeated in vitro sensitization (IVS). Total RNA was isolated from CTL and reverse-transcribed to cDNA. TCR usage was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TCR primers.\nCytolytic activity was non-specific within the first 2-4 weeks following IVS and TCR repertoire in these cultures revealed random V alpha and V beta gene usage. In contrast, by 6-10 weeks of culture, cytolysis was specifically directed against AM cells and such specific cytolysis was significantly correlated with TCR V alpha 1 (P \u003c 0.001).\nTCR V alpha 1 is associated with a common restricted melanoma antigen.","title":"T cell receptor usage by cytotoxic T lymphocytes against autologous human melanoma.","pubmedId":"9042192"}
