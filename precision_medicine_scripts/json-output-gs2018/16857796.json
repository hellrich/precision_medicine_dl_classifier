Response rates and survivals were analyzed according to maximal SUVs [low (\u003cor\u003d7.5) versus high (\u003e7.5), where 7.5 was the median value] before the first cycle of chemotherapy.\nEighty-five consecutive patients were included in the retrospective study. Patients with high SUV tumors exhibited significantly higher response rates (34.1% for low SUVs versus 61.0% for high SUVs; P \u003d 0.013). Other factors, including sex, age, histology, performance status, number of involved organs, regimens used, and disease stage, did not affect response. However, high SUVs were related with a shorter response duration (279 days for low SUVs versus 141 days for high SUVs; P \u003d 0.003) and time to progression (282 days for low SUVs versus 169 days for high SUVs; P \u003d 0.015). Overall survival was unaffected by maximal SUVs (623 days for low SUVs versus 464 days for high SUVs; P \u003d 0.431).\nPatients having NSCLC with high maximal SUVs showed a better response to platinum-based combination chemotherapy but had a shorter time to progression. Tumor glucose metabolism, as determined by SUVs on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, was found to discriminate NSCLC subsets with different clinical and biological features.","title":"High fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer on platinum-based combination chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"16857796"}
