Further, almost all gonadal seminomas/dysgerminomas exhibit KIT membranous staining, and several reports have clarified that some (10-25%) have a c-kit gene mutation. But, whether intracranial germinomas also have a c-kit gene mutation remains unsolved. To elucidate the presence, frequency, and location of c-kit gene mutations in intracranial germinomas, we analyzed five mutational hot spots (exons 9, 10, 11, 13, and 17) in the c-kit genomic DNA of 16 germinomas using polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. We found c-kit gene mutations at exon 11 (W557C) or 17 (D816V, D820V, and N822Y) in four germinomas (25.0%), although no statistically significant difference in any clinicopathological factor was found between patients with or without mutations. These results are similar to those seen in gonadal seminoma/dysgerminoma patients, and confirm that intracranial germinomas are exact counterparts of gonadal seminomas/dysgerminomas, as would be expected on histological and immunohistochemical grounds. Moreover, molecular targeting drugs such as imatinib mesylate (STI571), which is a selective inhibitor of KIT, might be promising agents for the treatment of intracranial germinomas with c-kit gene mutations.","title":"c-kit gene mutations in intracranial germinomas.","pubmedId":"15471556"}
