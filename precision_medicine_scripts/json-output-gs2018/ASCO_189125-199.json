To identify precise patients for targeted therapies and to reveal their clinical characteristics, we have operated clinical sequencing of advanced SqLCs in our nationwide genomic screening project in Japan (LC-SCRUM-Japan) since March 2015. Methods: As of December 2016, 190 institutions across Japan were participating and 263 advanced SqLC patients had been enrolled in this project. Submitted tumor samples were subjected to a next-generation sequencing system, Oncomine Comprehensive Assay, enabling the simultaneous analysis of 143 cancer-related genes. Results: The median age of the 263 patients was 74 years (range, 27-87 years). Two hundred thirty (87%) were male and most patients (97%) were smokers. Among 211 available samples, potentially targetable gene alterations were detected in 58 (27%). Based on these gene alterations, the patients were subdivided into 4 groups, consisting of 25 (12%) with genetic alterations of FGFR family (FGFR type; 23 FGFR1 amplifications, 1 FGFR2 amplification and 1 FGFR3 fusion), 20 (9%) with genetic alterations of the PI3K pathway (PI3K type; 10 PIK3CA mutations, 8 PTEN mutations and 2 AKT mutations), 15 (7%) with other oncogene alterations (KRAS/EGFR/ALK type; 10 KRAS mutations, 3 EGFR mutations and 2 ALK fusions) and others. Comparative analyses of clinical characteristics between the 4 types showed that brain metastases were significantly more frequent in the FGFR type than the others (24% vs. 5%, p \u003d 0.0007), and females (40% vs. 11%, p \u003d 0.0009) and never-smokers (21% vs. 3%, p \u003d 0.0004) were significantly frequent in the KRAS/EGFR/ALK type compared to the others. The prognostic significance of these genetic alterations has not yet been evaluated because of short follow-up time (median, 8.5 months). Conclusions: A series of potentially targetable gene alterations have been identified in SqLC patients. The SqLC patients had distinct clinical features according to the molecular subtypes, and genotype-directed therapeutic strategy should be developed for the individual subtypes.","title":"Clinical features of squamous cell lung cancer with targetable gene alterations in a nationwide genomic screening network in Japan (LC-SCRUM-Japan).","pubmedId":"ASCO_189125-199"}
