P16 overexpression is widely accepted as a surrogate marker for HPV positivity.\nA total of 92 serum samples from 75 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients were examined for HPV16 and 18 E7 antibodies by ELISA. Available tissue was tested for HPV-DNA by PCR, and p16 immunohistochemistry was obtained from a deidentified database.\nOf 75 HNSCC patients, 25 were HPV E7 seropositive. Seropositivity was strongly associated with cancers of the oropharynx, and correlated with positive p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HPV-DNA. Post-treatment serum was available in a limited subset of patients, revealing a decrease in antibody titers following response to treatment.\nHPV E7 seropositivity correlated with positive tumor HPV-DNA and p16 expression, and was strongly associated with cancers of the oropharynx. E7 serology warrants further study as a potential biomarker in HPV-positive HNSCC.","title":"Human papillomavirus E7 serology and association with p16 immunohistochemistry in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"26116154"}
