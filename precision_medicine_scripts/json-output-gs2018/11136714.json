Germline deletions of the region on 9p21 containing the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes and CDKN2A exon 1beta have been reported in kindreds, implicating contiguous tumour suppressor gene deletion as a cause of this syndrome. We describe a family characterized by multiple melanoma and neural cell tumours segregating with a germline deletion of the p14(ARF)-specific exon 1beta of the CDKN2A gene. This deletion does not affect the coding or minimal promoter sequences of either the CDKN2A or CDKN2B genes. Our results are consistent with either: (i) loss of p14(ARF) function being the critical abnormality associated with this syndrome, rather than contiguous loss of both the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes as suggested previously; or (ii) disruption of expression of p16 by mechanisms as yet unknown.","title":"A germline deletion of p14(ARF) but not CDKN2A in a melanoma-neural system tumour syndrome family.","pubmedId":"11136714"}
