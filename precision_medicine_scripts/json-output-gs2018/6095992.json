For the animal tumor model Balb/c mice and the mouse sarcoma L-1 tumor were used. Chemotherapy was administered before, immediately after, or some time after the injection of tumor cells. The antibiotic dosage given to mice was calculated on a body weight basis from the doses recommended for humans. Cefotaxime and clindamycin did not influence the animal tumor model, whereas mezlocillin and piperacillin showed positive or negative effects depending on the chemotherapy schedule. In vitro none of the four antibiotics caused cytotoxic activity in cell cultures of mouse sarcoma L-1, human lung cancer E-14, or human malignant melanoma MEW.","title":"Effects of cefotaxime, clindamycin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin on mouse sarcoma L-1 tumor.","pubmedId":"6095992"}
