In this study we investigated the expression of c-kit on different types of acute leukemia to determine the degree of specificity and sensitivity of this marker for the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. C-kit was positive in over half of the 115 cases of acute leukemia studied. Overall, two thirds of AML cases expressed c-kit, whereas only one of 23 ALL patients was c-kit positive. C-kit was also positive in 16 of 19 cases of myeloid blast crisis of myeloproliferative disorders and negative in four with a lymphoid phenotype. There was no correlation between c-kit expression and the degree of myeloid differentiation by FAB subtypes or other markers. We conclude that c-kit is a specific marker for the myeloid lineage, which is expressed early during hematopoietic differentiation and can aid the diagnosis of AML in difficult cases. More patients need to be tested to establish whether the expression of c-kit may define AML subgroups of prognostic significance.","title":"C-kit receptor (CD117) expression in acute leukemia.","pubmedId":"8605274"}
