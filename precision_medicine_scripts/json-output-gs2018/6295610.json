A complete regression of pleural, pulmonary parenchymal, cutaneous, and bone metastases was seen following therapy with 5-fluorouracil, Adriamycin, and mitomycin C. This is the second complete response to chemotherapy reported for a patient with metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary gland origin. Both complete responses and several partial responses have followed treatment with Adriamycin, suggesting that this drug is active in the disease.","title":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary gland.
