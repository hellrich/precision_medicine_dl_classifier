Patient characteristics were median age, GEJ-63 years, ST-64 years; sex, GEJ-84% male and 16% female, ST-60 male and 40 female; Zubrod PS, GEJ-25 had a PS of 0 and 18 had a PS 1, ST-13 had a PS of 0 and 12 had a PS of 1.\nPercentage of common toxicities were skin rash, 86% and 72%; fatigue, 51% and 44%; and AST/ALT elevation, 28% and 28%, respectively for GEJ and ST. There has been one confirmed complete response, three confirmed partial responses (PRs) and one unconfirmed PR for an overall response probability of 9% confirmed (95% CI, 3% to 22%), all occurring in GEJ stratum. No responses were observed in ST stratum. The median survival was 6.7 months in GEJ and 3.5 months in ST stratum. Neither intratumoral EGFR, transforming growth factor-alpha or phosphorylated Akt kinase expression nor plasma proteomic analyses were predictive of clinical outcome. No somatic mutations of the EGFR exons 18, 19, or 21 were detected and there was no gross amplification of EGFR by fluorescence in situ hybridization.\nErlotinib is active in patients with GEJ adenocarcinomas, but appears inactive in gastric cancers. The molecular correlates examined were not predictive of the patient therapeutic response.","title":"Phase II trial of erlotinib in gastroesophageal junction and gastric adenocarcinomas: SWOG 0127.","pubmedId":"17050876"}
