The exact role of the interaction between recipient T cells and the different cellular components of the donor valve in stimulating an immune response is not known. Therefore the T-cell response to valve endothelial and interstitial cells was investigated in vitro.\nValve endothelial and interstitial cells were characterized for cell-surface molecules before and after interferon gamma treatment by means of a panel of specific monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. The proliferative response of highly purified T lymphocytes was used to assess the immunogenicity of cultured valve endothelial and interstitial cells. This was further investigated by using a 2-step tolerance-induction protocol.\nValve endothelial and interstitial cells express similar levels of human leukocyte antigens and adhesion and costimulatory molecules, which are either induced or upregulated after interferon gamma treatment. T-cell responses to endothelial cells were detected after interferon gamma treatment, but responses to interferon gamma-treated interstitial cells were not detected. This lack of response resulted in the induction of T-cell anergy, which was reversed by the presence of the costimulatory molecule B7-1.\nAlthough valve endothelial and interstitial cells express a similar range of cell-surface molecules, it is only the endothelial cells that are immunogenic. In addition, we have shown that these 2 cell types interact in a donor-specific manner to orchestrate the immune response and therefore may have clinical relevance in the allogeneic response of the heart valve recipients.","title":"Valve interstitial cells induce donor-specific T-cell anergy.","pubmedId":"11436045"}
