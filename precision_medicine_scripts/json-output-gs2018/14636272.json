Recently, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein was shown to identify a subgroup of nodal ALCL with an excellent prognosis, whereas ALK-negative ALCLs are more heterogeneous. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological parameters in relation to clinical behaviour of ALK-negative ALCL compared with other nodal mature TCL, i.e. peripheral TCL, unspecified (PTCL-NOS) and angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (AILT).\nClinicopathological data of ALK-positive (n \u003d 28) and ALK-negative (n \u003d 46) ALCL; PTCL-NOS (n \u003d 47); and AILT (n \u003d 12) were analysed for their prognostic significance. While ALK-positive ALCL shows favourable clinical features and a good prognosis, ALK-negative ALCL, PTCL-NOS and AILT are all associated with high age groups, advanced disease stage, and poor prognosis (\u003c45% 5-year survival). In multivariate analysis of overall survival time, performed in the combined group of ALK-negative nodal mature T-cell lymphomas, only age and the International Prognostic Index (IPI) remained independent prognostic parameters, while lymphoma subtype (ALCL versus PTCL-NOS versus AILT) gave no additional information.\nThe distinction between ALK-negative ALCL and PTCL-NOS or AILT is of limited clinical relevance as they show comparable poor prognosis. In these lymphoma subtypes, only age and the IPI are of significant prognostic value.","title":"ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma demonstrates similar poor prognosis to peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified.","pubmedId":"14636272"}
