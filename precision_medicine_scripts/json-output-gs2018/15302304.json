The tumors were usually small, centrally located and nonpalpable. Histologically, six were malignant germ-cell tumors and three were Leydig-cell tumors; two patients had no histologic evidence of tumor. All patients with a history of undescended testis had malignant germ-cell tumors.\nThe use of trans-scrotal sonography enables early diagnosis of small nonpalpable tumors. A history of an undescended testis may necessitate a more aggressive approach, as these patients are at increased risk for testis cancer. Further studies are warranted to establish the yield of routine sonographic screening of infertile men and their specific management.","title":"Incidental testicular tumors in infertile men.","pubmedId":"15302304"}
