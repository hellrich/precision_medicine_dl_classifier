As such, the community of oncologists may see patients with CML more often than the primary-care physician and must focus on long-term management of adverse events and adherence. BCR-ABL1 TKIs are effective therapies in CML but are associated with distinct safety profiles. Thus, selection of long-term treatment with any TKI requires assessment of patient comorbidities and regular monitoring to identify the potential emergence of adverse effects or new risk factors. With a focus on long-term safety, this review provides a holistic picture of the primary care needs of patients with CML, emphasizing on the importance of community oncologists who in many cases act as both oncologists and primary-care physicians.","title":"Long-term BCR-ABL1 Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.","pubmedId":"26637844"}
