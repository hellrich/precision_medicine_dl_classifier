The amino acid sequence of the TK14 protein is closely related to the available partial sequence of the mouse protein bek, and more distantly related to the sequences of a chicken basic fibroblast growth factor receptor (73% sequence homology) and the apparent human equivalent of this receptor, the FLG protein (encoded by the fms-like tyrosine kinase gene). Overexpression of the TK14 protein by transfection of COS-1 cells with the corresponding cDNA in a simian virus 40-based expression vector leads to the appearance of new cell-surface binding sites for both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors. This has been demonstrated by specific binding assays and chemical cross-linking experiments using 125I-labeled growth factors. It appears, therefore, that the human genome contains at least two distinct genes, for TK14 and FLG, that code for related fibroblast growth factor receptors.","title":"Related fibroblast growth factor receptor genes exist in the human genome.","pubmedId":"2172978"}
