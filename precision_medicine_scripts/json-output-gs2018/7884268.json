Patient was a 64-year-old male, who was admitted with a episode of bloody sputum. A chest X-ray and rentogen tomogram showed a irregularity and narrowing of the upper trachea. Transbronchoscopic biopsy specimen showed squamous cell carcinoma. December \u002792, trachea was resected in the length of five cartilages and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Microscopic examination demonstrated a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with mediastinal lymph node metastasis. Therefore, he received a course of 30 Gy of radiation to the upper mediastinum after surgery. Three years before the tracheal resection, he had undergone left pneumonectomy for moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Nineteen months after the pulmonary resection, he had undergone low anterior resection of the colon for the rectum carcinoma.","title":"[A case of metachronous primary cancer of the lung, rectum and trachea].","pubmedId":"7884268"}
