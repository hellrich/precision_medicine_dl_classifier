Melanoma antigen genes (MAGEs), which are expressed in malignant tissues but not in normal tissues (except for placenta and testis), might provide such a marker. To date, however, the use of MAGEs in the detection of occult tumor cells using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been limited because of the heterogeneity and low expression of individual MAGEs in tumor tissues.\nWe developed multiple MAGE-recognizing primers (MMRPs) that were capable of binding to the cyclic DNA of 6 MAGE-A gene subtypes (MAGE-A1-MAGE-A6). We assessed the ability of the MMRPs to detect the expression of MAGE-A gene subtypes in peripheral blood obtained from patients with benign or malignant breast disease.\nMAGE-A gene expression was not detected in 32 patients with benign disease but was detected in 1 of 31 patients (3%) patients with negative lymph node breast carcinoma, in 10 of 52 patients (19%) with 1-3 positive lymph nodes, in 11 of 53 patients (21%) with \u003e or \u003d 4 positive lymph nodes, and in 20 of 52 patients (39%) with metastatic disease. The results were statistically significant (P \u003c 0.0001; chi-square test for linear-by-linear association). The results also showed that the detection of MAGE-A gene expression in the blood predicted tumor progression or recurrence.\nThe results suggested that MAGE-A gene expression may be used for the surveillance of circulating breast carcinoma cells after primary therapy by RT-nested PCR using MMRPs.","title":"The melanoma antigen gene as a surveillance marker for the detection of circulating tumor cells in patients with breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"15937912"}
