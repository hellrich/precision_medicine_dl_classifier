Here we present data obtained on a primary culture of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma treated with chemotherapy and injected into the zebrafish model as the proof of concept of the usefulness of near patients models in the study of cancer cells aggressiveness and responsiveness to drugs. Methods: Primary dedifferentiated liposarcoma cells isolated from patient undergoing surgery were cultured on 3D collagen scaffolds as well as on 2D conventional supports. Cells were treated with trabectedin and with the standard combination ifosfamide and epirubicin. Aggressiveness markers were assayed by qPCR. Cells were injected in the heart cavity of zebrafish embryos, monitoring the embryos daily. Results: The 3D tumor model were enriched for cancer cells, as demonstrated by a higher percentage of MDM2-positive primary dedifferentiated liposarcoma cells respect to 2D cultures (55% vs 5%) and preserve liposarcoma-associated markers as -catenin, MMPs and ALDH1.Chemotherapy proved effective on 3D-enriched liposarcoma cells with percentages of survival significantly lower to controls, and not significantly different between epirubicin plus ifosfamide and trabectedin alone, being respectively 48% and 53%. Liposarcoma cells injected in zebrafish were capable of surviving in the heart cavity and in later stages were scattered throughout the implantation area showing local migratory and invasive abilities, and the successful engraftment of this patient-derived liposarcoma culture in this animal model. Conclusions: The implementation of synergistic in vitro and in vivo models has allowed us to observe the aggressiveness abilities of a liposarcoma primary culture. We demonstrated in vitro a similar efficacy of trabectidin respect to the conventional first line therapy epirubicin plus ifosfamide opening new horizons to better investigate the mechanism of action of these drugs and the treatment strategy of dedifferentiated liposarcomas.","title":"Establishment of a near patient model of dedifferentiated liposarcoma: A proof of concept of the usefulness of zebrafish model.","pubmedId":"ASCO_166145-176"}
