Tumor cells often have deregulated Myc expression, which consequently promotes uncontrolled proliferation. Recent work in our lab using a mouse model of lung cancer has demonstrated that expression of a dominant negative form of Myc causes tumor regression whilst having mild and reversible effects on normal proliferating tissues. However the cellular mechanism of how Myc inhibition leads to tumor regression is not known. Here we show that Myc inhibition causes metabolic changes in tumor cells associated with a reduced proliferative/biosynthetic state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Myc inhibition leads to p21 expression independently of p53 and may account for tumor cell cycle arrest.","title":"Cellular mechanisms of tumor regression following Myc inhibition","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1568"}
