Patients with the disease usually present with a late stage disease with a poor prognosis. The prognostic factors reported in previous studies are not homogeneous and it is no clear the clinical or pathogenic role of c-KIT expression this neoplasm. Breslow staging currently is the most accurate predictor factor.\nWe performed a clinicopathological study with literature review to identify predictors of prognosis and survival in melanoma of the vulva and investigated the expression of c-KIT (by immunohistochemistry) in 10 patients from the Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog√≠a (Mexico City, Mexico).\nTen patients were identified, all older women with delayed presentation, high stage disease and limited response to treatment. We identified 5 patients (50%) with c-KIT expression, four of them recurred (p\u003d0.01) and ultimately 3 died (p\u003d0.038). We identified a) Satellitosis and b) c-KIT expression as prognostic predictors for death.\nWe conclude that c-KIT expression is a valuable predictor of prognosis and survival, especially in tick (\u003e 4 mm) melanoma.","title":"Satellitosis and CD117 immunohistochemical expression correlates with poor outcome in thick vulvar melanoma.","pubmedId":"27377140"}
