Leukemia initially spread into the pharynx, gingiva, lymphnode, and bone marrow. He achieved complete remission after chemotherapy but developed blurred vision and hypopyon. Anterior chamber paracentesis disclosed leukemic infiltration of the anterior chamber. Infiltration of the central nervous system also occurred. He received systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, and local chemotherapy. However, he did not achieve prolonged remission. These findings suggest that these chemotherapy treatments have an inadequate effect for AML with anterior chamber infiltration. This rare complication is associated with extramedullary infiltration of leukemia.","title":"Leukemic hypopyon in acute myelogenous leukemia.","pubmedId":"10985367"}
