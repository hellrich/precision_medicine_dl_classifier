RET is expressed during embryogenesis in a temporally and spatially regulated manner, and plays an important role in the normal development of a variety of cell lineages, particularly in the establishment of the enteric nervous system. RET mutations observed in patients with HD are scattered along the gene without any hot spots, and possess a loss-of-function effect. RET mutations are detected with a higher incidence among familial cases (50%) than sporadic cases (15%-20%), and are more closely associated with long-segment HD than short-segment disease. In contrast to HD mutations, missense mutations observed in MEN 2 syndromes occur at specific codons, and gene rearrangements are characteristic in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Both missense mutations and gene rearrangements act in a dominant fashion, and cause constitutive phosphorylation on the tyrosine of RET and highly enhance RET kinase activity, leading to transforming or oncogenic activity.","title":"The RET proto-oncogene: a challenge to our understanding of disease pathogenesis.","pubmedId":"9035202"}
