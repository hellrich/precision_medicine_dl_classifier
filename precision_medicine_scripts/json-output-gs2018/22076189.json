Therefore, the incidence of remnant gastric cancer is increasing. This study was performed to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with remnant gastric cancer.\nFrom January 2005 to December 2009, twenty-nine patients with remnant gastric cancer and who underwent surgery at Pusan National University Hospital were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed their medical records. We also divided them into two groups: the remnant gastric cancer (RGC)-B group (first operation for benign disease) and the RGC-M group (first operation for malignant disease).\nThe RGC-B group included ten patients and the RGC-M group included nineteen patients. The mean interval between the first and second operations was 17 years. The curative resection rate was 93.1% (27/29). The postoperative complication rate was 20.7% (6/29) and there was no perioperative mortality. Ten (37%) of twenty-seven patients experienced recurrence after curative resection and eight patients (27.6%) expired due to aggravation of remnant stomach cancer. An advanced TNM stage and non-curative resection were the negative prognostic factors for survival for patients with remnant stomach cancer (P\u003d0.0453 and P\u003c0.001). The RGC-M group showed a shorter interval (P\u003c0.001) and the RGC-B group had more advanced TNM stage (P\u003d0.003).\nLong-term follow-up should be considered not only for patients who undergo an operation for malignant disease, but also for the patients who underwent an operation for benign disease. When remnant gastric cancer is diagnosed, curative resection is essential to improve the survival.","title":"Clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of remnant gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"22076189"}
