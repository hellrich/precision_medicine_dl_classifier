A 57-year-old Japanese male with stage IIA squamous cell carcinoma of the lung received sensitivity-based induction chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel (70 mg/m2) given on days 1, 22, and 43. He was treated as an outpatient, and no serious side effects were observed. After the chemotherapy, the left upper bronchus was reopened by the reduction of the tumor, and a left pneumonectomy with simultaneous partial resection of the pericardium was performed. After discharge, the patient received 2 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, consisting of weekly docetaxel doses (35 mg/m2) for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by one week without treatment. Although the 3-year survival rate of stage IIIA NSCLC patients is under 30%, three years after administration of the chemotherapy no other recurrence site has been detected, and the patient is in good health. Using CD-DST, sensitivity-based induction chemotherapy with docetaxel was successful in the patient reported here.","title":"Successful management of a patient with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer using sensitivity-based induction chemotherapy--report of a case.","pubmedId":"15570940"}
