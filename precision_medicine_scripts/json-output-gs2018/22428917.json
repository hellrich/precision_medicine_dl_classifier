Brentuximab vedotin has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma (HL) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in other CD30(+) lymphomas is currently being investigated.\nIn this paper, we review the currently available treatment options for systemic peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) and the role of brentuximab vedotin in relapsed or refractory ALCL. In addition, ongoing clinical trial of brentuximab vedotin in relapsed PTCL and combination therapy with other chemotherapies for initial treatment of CD30 lymphoma will also be reviewed.\nBrentuximab vedotin has established its role in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL and ALCL. In the next few years, the efficacy of this agent in other CD30(+) lymphomas will be described. The safety and efficacy of several brentuximab-based combination regimens, including use as frontline chemotherapy is under investigation.","title":"Brentuximab vedotin  in systemic T-cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"22428917"}
