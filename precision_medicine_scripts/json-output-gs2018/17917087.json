All 27 patients underwent potentially curative pulmonary resection. Clinicopathological information was obtained from patient records and pathology reports. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression model was used for multivariate analysis.\nHeterozygous EGFR mutations were detected in 15 of 27 patients (55.5%). There was no significant difference in DFS between patients with wild-type EGFR (median, 16.87 months) and mutant EGFR (median, 18.13 months; P \u003d 0.83). No significant difference in OS was also noted between the wild-type and mutant groups (P \u003d 0.45, median follow-up 22.6 months). Cox regression model and multivariate analysis of survival difference by age, stage, histology, and adjuvant treatment did not reach statistical significance.\nEGFR mutations do not have significant prognostic value in primary resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and further well-designed large prospective studies are warranted to determine the prognostic value of EGFR mutations in NSCLC.","title":"Lack of prognostic value of EGFR mutations in primary resected non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"17917087"}
