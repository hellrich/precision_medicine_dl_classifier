Initially saved in infancy by breast-feeding and good medical care, later in his twenties he responded well to diiodohydroxyquinoline (Diodoquin) therapy, his only residua being dermatitis, hoarseness, and short stature. Subsequently untreated, this patient years later developed not only a dermatofibrosarcoma but also a large amelanotic malignant melanoma. Both were successfully excised. Subsequently, oral zinc therapy initiated for the first time cleared his acrodermatitis, which had been present for 60 years. It is suggested that this patient\u0027s malignancies developed as a result of an immune deficiency state typically found in acrodermatitis enteropathica. On this basis, acrodermatitis enteropathica may be viewed as having a malignant potential over the long term. The zinc-dependent nature of the immune deficit, however, suggests that lifelong daily zinc supplementation is an appropriate prophylactic measure.","title":"Malignant melanoma and dermatofibrosarcoma in a 60-year-old patient with lifelong acrodermatitis enteropathica.","pubmedId":"6806338"}
