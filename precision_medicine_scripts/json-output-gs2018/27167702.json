They are valuable for predicting prognosis and dose selection. Moreover, they may be helpful in detecting therapeutic and adverse responses and in patient stratification based on efficacy or safety prediction. Thus, biomarkers are essential tools for the selection of appropriate patients for treatment with certain drugs to and enable personalized medicine, that is \u0027providing the right treatment to the right patient, at the right dose at the right time\u0027. Currently, there are six drugs approved for dermatological indications with recommended or mandatory biomarker testing. Most of them are used to treat melanoma and human immunodeficiency virus infection. In contrast to the few fully validated biomarkers, many exploratory biomarkers and biomarker candidates have potential applications. Prognostic biomarkers are of particular significance for malignant conditions. Similarly, diagnostic biomarkers are important in autoimmune diseases. Disease severity biomarkers are helpful tools in the treatment for inflammatory skin diseases. Identification, qualification and implementation of the different kinds of biomarkers are challenging and frequently necessitate collaborative efforts. This is particularly true for stratification biomarkers that require a companion diagnostic marker that is co-developed with a certain drug. In this article general definitions and requirements for biomarkers as well as for the impact of biomarkers in dermatology are reviewed and opportunities and challenges are discussed.
