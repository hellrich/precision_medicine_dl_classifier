He received chemoendocrine therapy with both DESD and HCFU following subcapsular orchiectomy since 1983. As a result of the treatment, the prostate cancer was stabilized. At the end of 1988, the serum levels of PA were elevated. Diagnostic imaging revealed a local recurrence in the prostate. The pathological analysis of the prostate revealed undifferentiated adenocarcinoma. Intraarterial chemotherapy with a reservoir system was carried out. Doses of CDDP, ADM and MTX were 75 mg, 30 mg and 50 mg, respectively. Eight weeks after intraarterial chemotherapy, the regression rate was 60%, and serum PA titer improved to within normal limits. In this case, as the initial clue for suspecting recurrence, periodic detection of PA was useful, and the intraarterial chemotherapy was considered useful for the control of the locally recurrent prostate carcinoma.","title":"[A case report of relapsed stage D2 prostate cancer successfully treated with intraarterial chemotherapy].","pubmedId":"1719941"}
