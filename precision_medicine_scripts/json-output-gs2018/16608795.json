In contrast to the other three mutations, the G to C transversion on position 169 (Ala57Pro) has been found in several other studies before. Further investigations on mutations of the other exons 1alpha, 1beta and 3 are necessary.\nAlterations of p16(INK4A) have been found in different types of human cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to perform a screening for alterations of exon 2 of different SCCs of the head and neck region.\nForty samples of different SCCs of the head and neck were collected by biopsy or surgical resection. Exon 2 was amplified by using the primers 5\u0027-GGTGAGGGGGCTCTACACAAG-3\u0027 and 5\u0027-GTCTCCCGGGCTGAACTTTC-3\u0027. DNA was sequenced with the primer 5\u0027-CGGGCTGAACTTTCTGTGCT-3\u0027.\nMutations were found in 4 of our 40 samples. One sample showed a G to C transversion on position 169 (Ala57Pro), a second sample from the same patient confirmed the latter transition but also contained a transition C to T on position 179 (Ala60Val). Another patient showed an already known polymorphism, a transition G to A at position 442 (Ala148Thr). The third case was a transversion C to A on position 213 (Asn71Lys).","title":"p16(INK4alpha)/exon 2 mutations in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region.","pubmedId":"16608795"}
