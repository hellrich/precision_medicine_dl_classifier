Our previous studies has also shown that FRK over-expression inhibited the migration/invasion, proliferation and promoted apoptosis of glioma cells. However, the mechanism of FRK on glioma cell migration/invasion, proliferation and apoptosis is still not clear. In this study, we found that FRK over-expression increased the protein level of N-cadherin, but not that of E-cadherin. Meanwhile, FRK over-expression promoted -catenin translocation to the plasma membrane, where it formed complex with N-cadherin, while inhibited -catenin translocation to the nucleus. In addition, down-regulation of N-cadherin by siRNA promoted the migration/ invasion proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of glioma U251 and U87 cells. Interestingly, N-cadherin down-regulation abolished the effect of FRK on glioma cell migration/invasion, proliferation and apoptosis. In summary, these results indicate that FRK regulates glioma cell progression by promoting N-cadherin/-catenin complex formation.","title":"FRK regulates glioma cell progression by promoting N-cadherin/-catenin complex formation","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2030"}
