Conversely, the upregulation of the chemokine (CXC) receptor 4 (CXCR4) is associated with prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Studies have shown that loss of PTEN permits CXCR4-mediated functions in prostate cancer cells. Loss of PTEN function is typically due to genetic and epigenetic modulations, as well as active site oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS); likewise ROS upregulates CXCR4 expression. Herein, we show that ROS accumulation permitted CXCR4-mediated functions through PTEN catalytic inactivation. ROS increased p-AKT and CXCR4 expression, which were abrogated by a ROS scavenger in prostate cancer cells. ROS mediated PTEN inactivation but did not affect expression, yet enhanced cell migration and invasion in a CXCR4-dependent manner. Collectively, our studies add to the body of knowledge on the regulatory role of PTEN in CXCR4-mediated cancer progression, and hopefully, will contribute to the development of therapies that target the tumor microenvironment, which have great potential for the better management of a metastatic disease.","title":"ROS enhances CXCR4-mediated functions through inactivation of PTEN in prostate cancer cells.","pubmedId":"21627959"}
