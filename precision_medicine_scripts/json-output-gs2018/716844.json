Both phenomena increase with increased malignancy. This provides further evidence for membrane alterations with malignant change in human astrocytic cells. It is the first comparison of fibrillary astrocytoma surface phenomena with those of more malignant astrocytic tumors of the cerebrum.","title":"Frequency of surface microprojections and coated vesicles with increased malignancy in human astrocytic neoplasms.","pubmedId":"716844"}
