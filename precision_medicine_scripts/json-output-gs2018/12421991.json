Previously, extensive analysis of the specificity of class I-restricted T cells from patient 888 TIL has revealed that these T cells recognize a mutated, as well as several nonmutated tumor Ags. Additional studies that were conducted on TIL from patient 888 indicated that they contained CD4-positive T cells that recognized the autologous tumor that had been induced to express HLA class II molecules. Tumor-reactive CD4-positive T cell clones were isolated from TIL and tested for their ability to react with Ags that are recognized by HLA class I-restricted, melanoma-reactive T cells. Using this approach, T cell clones were identified that recognized an epitope expressed in both the tyrosinase-related protein 1 and tyrosinase-related protein 2 Ags in the context of the HLA-DRbeta1*1502 class II gene product. Additional clones were found to recognize an epitope of gp100 in the context of the same HLA-DR restriction element. These observations provide an impetus to develop strategies directed toward generating HLA class II-restricted tumor-reactive T cells.","title":"Multiple HLA class II-restricted melanocyte differentiation antigens are recognized by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from a patient with melanoma.","pubmedId":"12421991"}
