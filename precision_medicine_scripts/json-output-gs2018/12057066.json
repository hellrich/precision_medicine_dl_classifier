Strategies to improve the prognosis for such patients with effective adjuvant therapies are critical. In recent randomized trials conducted by the cooperative groups in the United States of patients at high risk for recurrence (patients with thick primary melanomas and those with regional lymph node metastases) administered adjuvant therapy with high-dose interferon alfa-2b (HDI), relapse-free survival and overall survival rates improved significantly. Research efforts in this area continue to assess the role of intermediate-dose interferon, but there is no convincing evidence of success of the lower-dose regimens, despite the reduction in toxicity. For a subset of patients at highest risk (two or more involved lymph nodes), a regimen of therapy for metastatic stage IV melanoma (interleukin-2 based biochemotherapy) is being compared with HDI in an ongoing phase III trial. For intermediate-risk melanoma, no effective adjuvant therapy is available. For such patients, enrollment in ongoing clinical trials assessing the role of shorter courses of HDI or vaccines should be encouraged.","title":"Intermediate- and high-risk melanoma.","pubmedId":"12057066"}
