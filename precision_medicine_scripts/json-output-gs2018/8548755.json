Alterations of each of these components have been described in primary human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or in GBM cell lines. Because perturbation of any component in this pathway may have similar oncogenic effects, we studied the relationship between abnormalities of CDKN2/p16 and RB, the two commonly involved tumor suppressor genes, in 55 astrocytic gliomas (42 GBMs, 8 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 5 astrocytomas). By using comparative multiplex PCR, homozygous deletions of the CDKN2/p16 gene were detected in 24 GBMs (57%) and in 2 anaplastic astrocytomas. Two additional GBMs and one anaplastic astrocytoma had allelic loss of chromosome 9p, as assessed by microsatellite polymorphisms flanking the CDKN2/p16 region. Single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis of all three coding exons of CDKN2/p16 revealed a frameshift mutation (four-bp deletion) in one of the three GBMs that had lost the remaining 9p allele. Allelic loss of chromosome 13q at the RB gene, RB gene mutations, or loss of pRb expression was noted in 14 GBMs (33%) and 2 anaplastic astrocytomas. Thirty-six of 42 GBMs (86%) had alterations of either CDKN2/p16 (n \u003d 22), RB (n \u003d 10), or both (n \u003d 4); these two genetic changes, however, were relatively exclusive (P \u003d 0.003). Furthermore, of the six GBMs without either CDKN2/p16 or RB gene abnormalities, one case had CDK4 gene amplification. These data indicate that the vast majority of GBMs probably have inactivation of the p16-cdk4/cyclin D1-pRb pathway. The findings also provide corroborative evidence that CDKN2/p16 and RB are the critical glioma tumor suppressor genes on chromosomes 9p and 13q, respectively.","title":"CDKN2/p16 or RB alterations occur in the majority of glioblastomas and are inversely correlated.","pubmedId":"8548755"}
