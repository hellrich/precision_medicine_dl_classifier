Methods: In the prospective study medical records and tumor samples of 60 patients with HNSCC with stage I - IVB (37 men, 23 women; median age 59) were analyzed. All patients were under standard clinical complex protocol. All patients were under our supervision from 2010 to 2015. Demographic data, clinical stage, tumor morphological characteristics and specific level of expression of CD8(+) T-cells, eosinophils and neutrophils in the tumor and microenvironment, eapression p16 in the tumor were examined. Results: Rate of neutrophils in tumor and microenvironment varied from 0 to 1000 cells in mm2 (average rate 266,167,9 cells, 95% CI from 23,23 to 308,89; p \u003d 0,03). Rate of eosinophils varied from 0 to 872 cells in mm2 (average rate 12,884,4 cells, 95% CI from 3,5 to 22,23; p \u003d 0.01). Expression of CD8(+) T-cells varied from 190 to 1380 cells in mm2(average rate 551,2880,74 cells, 95% CI from 380,93 to 721,62; p \u003c 0.0001). Neutrophils rate had inversely correlation with cornification (r \u003d -0.63, 95% CI from -0,87 to -0,18, p \u003d 0,0114). Expression of CD8(+) T-cells had inversely correlation with tumor size (T) (r \u003d -0.53, 95% CI from -0,8 to -0,09, p \u003d 0,0227), stage (r \u003d -0.48, 95% CI from -0,77 to -0,01, p \u003d 0,0461) and direct correlation with cornification (r \u003d -0.54, 95% CI from 0,03 to 0,83, p \u003d 0,0391). Expression of p16 was detected only in 10 samples (16,6%). Conclusions: Definition of intratumoral expression of CD8(+) T-cells and infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils could be informative prognostic factors for patient with HNSCC.","title":"Immunological microenvironment in the clinical outcome of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_162824-176"}
