Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK is the most important pathway in thyroid cancer. Sorafenib has activity against BRAF, RET and VEGFR. Tipifarnib inhibits farnesyl transferase, preventing activation of Ras and selectively killing Ras-transformed cells. Methods: As part of a phase I trial, we treated 35 differentiated and medullary thyroid cancer patients. Secondary endpoints included efficacy. Sorafenib and tipifarnib were given for 21 days and repeated every 28. RECIST was used to determine response. Results: We enrolled 22 patients with metastatic DTC (16 PTC, 5 FTC, 1 poorly differentiated), 13 with MTC, of which 15 DTC and 10 MTC patients were restaged. Ten patients were discontinued from the study prior to first re-staging due to toxicities. Best response in DTC: 1/15 (7%) PR, 13/15 (86%) SD, 1/15 (7%) PD; MTC: 5/10 (50%) PR, 5/10 (50%) SD, 0/10 PD. Durable responses (PR or SD 6 months): 13/15 (87%) of DTC; 9/10 (90%) of MTC. The median follow up was 19 months in DTC and 27 months in MTC. Median PFS was 20 months in the DTC group and 15 months in MTC. Median overall survival has not been reached in either group, but at 24 months, overall survival was 79% in DTC and 88% in MTC. Major dose-limiting toxicities in this cohort were grade 3 rash in 4/36 (11%). Other common skin toxicites were grade 1-2 hand-foot skin reaction 13/35 (37%); grade 1-2 rash 15/35 (43%). Maximum tolerated dose was sorafenib 600mg/tipifarnib 200mg (split dosing). Conclusions: Combination sorafenib/tipifarnib is promising for treatment of metastatic DTC and MTC, however, further evaluation in phase II trials is warranted.","title":"Phase I trial of combination sorafenib and tipifarnib: The experience in advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_48760-74"}
