It was stated, that preference should be given to the partial lung resections (lob- and segmentectomies). The authors recommended to avoid pneumoectomy and typical resection of the lung as non-radical operations accompanied by high rate of local recurrences. The comorbidity background of patients should be thoroughly investigated before planning of surgery. If necessary, a surgical treatment of accompanied vascular pathology should be fulfilled as the first stage before oncology surgery.","title":"[TREATMENT OF NON-SMALL CELL CARCINOMA OF LUNG IN SENILE PATIENTS].","pubmedId":"26601523"}
