Several p53 mutants can exert oncogenic functions beyond their negative domination over the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor functions. These so-called gain-of-function effects, such as enhancement of tumorigenicity and therapy resistance, were investigated in p53-null cells. The possible mechanisms by which p53 mutants exert their gain-of-function effects are reviewed. The existence of functional gains of certain p53 mutants has important ramifications for tumor prognosis and cancer therapies.","title":"Gain-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53.","pubmedId":"10873062"}
