To determine the role of HER-2/neu overexpression and other clinical predictors (symptoms at presentation) of adverse outcome in ESSCLC, we performed a retrospective study on subjects with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of ESSCLC. HER-2/neu overexpression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on paraffin-embedded specimens. An IHC score of \u003e or \u003d 2+ was considered positive for overexpression. Between 1991 and 2000, 223 patients with ESSCLC were identified, of whom 193 patients (84 females, 109 males) with a mean age of 68.5 years (range: 42-90 years) had adequate tissue specimens for HER-2/neu testing. The symptoms at initial presentation and proportionate number of patients were: weight loss 61 (31.6%), cough 53 (27.5%), dyspnea 33 (17.1%), mass on chest radiograph 18 (9.3%), chest pain 15 (7.7%), asymptomatic 14 (7.2%) and others (weakness, lymphadenopathy, hoarseness and paraneoplastic syndromes) 29 (15.0%). Of the 193 specimens, 57 (29.5%) revealed HER-2/neu overexpression. The median survival for patients with ESSCLC who were HER-2/neu positive was 8 months (range: 1-25.5 months) while that in the HER-2/neu negative group was 16 months (range: 2-34 months). Interestingly, after adjusting for age, performance status and type of therapy, subset analysis revealed that the survival was significantly lower in HER-2/neu positive individuals (P\u003c0.001; Mann-Whitney U-test). In our study, weight loss and cough were the two most common (59%) presenting complaints in patients with ESSCLC. Also, since HER-2/neu positivity was a marker for poor prognosis in ESSCLC, testing for overexpression may play a role in identifying patients at risk for shortened survival. Further studies would delineate whether HER-2/neu overexpression renders SCLC chemoresistant and thus, adversely affects outcome. There exists a need for randomized controlled trials to assess the role of Herceptin (alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy) in patients with ESSCLC.","title":"Predictive role of HER-2/neu overexpression and clinical features at initial presentation in patients with extensive stage small cell lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"12009234"}
