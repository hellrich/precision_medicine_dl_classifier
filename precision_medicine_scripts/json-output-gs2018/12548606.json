The authors studied the prognostic significance of p21 and p27 in patients with high-grade astrocytomas who were treated with radiotherapy.\nThe expression of p27 and p21 was analyzed immunohistochemically in 52 glioblastomas and 25 anaplastic astrocytomas. All patients underwent surgery for the first time and were treated with adjuvant external radiotherapy.\nThe p27 labeling index (LI) was \u003c 30% in 36% of tumors, 30-50% in 25% of tumors, and \u003e 50% in 39% of tumors. A significant difference in cumulative survival was observed between these groups (P \u003d 0.0072; log-rank test). The p21 LI was \u003c 30% in 48% of tumors, 30-50% in 39% of tumors, and \u003e 50% in 13% of tumors; these groups did not differ significantly in survival. In multivariate Cox analysis, p27 LI was an independent prognostic factor (P \u003d 0.0008). The grade of malignancy and proliferation activity also were independent prognostic factors.\nAlthough p27 and p21 are parallel cell-cycle regulators, only p27 has independent prognostic value in patients with malignant astrocytomas. It appears that decreased levels of p21/p27 are associated with a poor prognosis and short survival.","title":"Low expression of p27 indicates a poor prognosis in patients with high-grade astrocytomas.","pubmedId":"12548606"}
