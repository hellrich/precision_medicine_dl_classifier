Four patients with non-PCP lung disease served as control subjects. In PCP patients, BAL LDH was sixfold higher, and BAL ALB, fourfold higher than in the non-PCP patients. The increased LDH/ALB in BAL as compared to serum, in addition to a BAL isoenzyme pattern characteristic of lung, suggest that BAL LDH arises from a pulmonary source. We postulate that the high correlation observed between BAL and serum LDH (r \u003d 0.93, p less than 0.001) reflects backflow of pulmonary-derived LDH into the blood through an alveolocapillary membrane (ACM) compromised by PCP. Furthermore, a comparison of BAL LDH/ALB for each isoenzyme with the same serum ratio showed less backflow for the cationic isoenzymes. The ACM appears to sieve proteins on an electrical basis which may account for the LDH isomorphic pattern observed in the serum of PCP patients.","title":"Elevated lactate dehydrogenase values in patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.","pubmedId":"3258807"}
