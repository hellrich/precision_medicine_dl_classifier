It has a tendency for a prolonged clinical course, with local recurrences and distant metastases sometimes occurring many years after presentation. Standard treatment for salivary gland ACC is surgery and post-operative radiotherapy. The aim of this review was to examine the reported efficacy of various chemotherapy regimens and molecular therapies on recurrent/metastatic salivary gland ACC. One hundred and fourteen publications were reviewed on chemotherapy as well as possible molecular targets of therapy, including KIT, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth receptor-2 (HER-2), oestrogen and progesterone receptors, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Ki-67 and the p53, bcl-2 and SOX-4 genes. Reported response rates to combination chemotherapy are low and response duration generally short lived. The response to molecular therapies is low also. More research into novel molecular targets is needed.","title":"Salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma: a review of chemotherapy and molecular therapies.","pubmedId":"16757203"}
