Here, we characterized the MELOE-1/A2-specific T-cell repertoire in healthy donors and melanoma patients to further support an immunotherapy targeting this epitope. Using tetramer enrichment followed by multicolor staining, we found that MELOE-1-specific T cells were present in the blood of healthy donors and patients at similar frequencies (around 1 in 1x10(5) CD8(+) cells). These cells mainly displayed a na√Øve phenotype in 4/6 healthy donors and 3/6 patients, whereas high proportions of memory cells were observed in the remaining individuals of both groups. There was a recurrent usage of the Valpha12.1 chain for 17/18 MELOE-1-specific T-cell clones derived from healthy donors or patients, associated with diverse Vbeta chains and V(D)J junctional sequences. All clones derived from melanoma patients (9/9) were reactive against the MELOE-1(36-44) peptide and against HLA-A2(+) melanoma cell lines. This study documents the existence of a large TCR repertoire specific for the MELOE-1/A2 epitope and its capacity to give rise to antitumor CTL that supports the development of immunotherapies targeting this epitope.","title":"Frequent occurrence of high affinity T cells against MELOE-1 makes this antigen an attractive target for melanoma immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"20217862"}
