The majority of studies in pediatric and adult AML have shown that FLT3 mutations are powerful prognostic factors predicting for increased relapse risk and adverse overall survival. Some reports have suggested that loss of the wild type allele might be associated with an even worse prognosis. Changes in the pattern of FLT3 mutations between disease presentation and relapse restrict their value as a marker of minimal residual disease, and have significant implications for therapy. The optimum treatment for patients with FLT3 mutations remains unknown and large prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of various treatment modalities such as bone marrow transplantation and targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","title":"Prognostic implications of the presence of FLT3 mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"12854887"}
