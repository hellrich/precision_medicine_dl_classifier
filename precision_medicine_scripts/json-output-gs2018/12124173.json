Here we report the identification of a small molecule FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKC412, which selectively induced G1 arrest and apoptosis of Ba/F3 cell lines expressing mutant FLT3 (IC(50) \u003c 10 nM) by directly inhibiting the tyrosine kinase. Ba/F3-FLT3 cell lines made resistant to PKC412 demonstrated overexpression of mutant FLT3, confirming that FLT3 is the target of this drug. Finally, progressive leukemia was prevented in PKC412-treated Balb/c mice transplanted with marrow transduced with a FLT3-ITD-expressing retrovirus. PKC412 is a potent inhibitor of mutant FLT3 and is a candidate for testing as an antileukemia agent in AML patients with mutant FLT3 receptors.","title":"Inhibition of mutant FLT3 receptors in leukemia cells by the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKC412.","pubmedId":"12124173"}
