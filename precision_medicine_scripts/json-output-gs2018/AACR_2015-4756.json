In this study, we tried to find out genomic alterations in CBF-AML so as to find genetic changes that determine prognosis of CBF-AML.Materials and methodsWe performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 9 AML-ETO rearranged AML patients. For whole genome sequencing, we used Hiseq 2000 (Illumina, SanDiego, CA, USA). Single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling was performed using 4 different callers. Structural variant calling was performed using three different callers.ResultsAmong 9 patients, two patients had excellent prognosis, while 3 patients showed unfavorable outcome with conventional chemotherapy. 4 patients had undetermined prognosis. As for SNV, the most frequent common non-synonymous SNV was KIT mutation, while ADAMTS17 and CFAP46 mutation was found in 2/9 patients respectively. Noticeable non-synonymous SNV found only in patients with poor prognosis included NRAS, ADAM29, AGO1, and ALAS2 mutation. For structural variation, LOC44166 inversion, ANKRD26P1 deletion, EMBP1 translocation were noticeable structural variants other than AML-ETO rearrangement in these patients.ConclusionNot a single genetic factor was attributable to the prognosis in CBF-AML. Further validation of genetic alterations found study in this study is ongoing.","title":"Genomic profile of AML-ETO rearranged acute myeloid leukemia","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4756"}
