{"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Tumor spread beyond the peritoneal cavity in cases of papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the unknown primary (CUP) is a rare late event and carries a poor prognosis.\nA 71-year-old female was referred to our hospital because of a large right inguinal tumor with biopsy evidence of carcinoma as well as an elevated serum CA125 (cancer antigen 125). She underwent complete resection of the right inguinal tumor and multiple pelvic tumors, which involved the rectum, ovary and uterus. Pathological examination revealed the tumors to be metastases of a papillary serous adenocarcinoma with a psammoma body of CUP. On the 28th postoperative day, newly developed asymptomatic small left inguinal node metastases in the setting of a normal CA125 level were removed. Four and a half years after the primary resection, the CA125 level increased again and newly developed asymptomatic metastases were found in the right deep inguinal nodes and extirpated at that time. All surgical resections followed the modified FAM (5FU, Adriamycin; ADM, MMC) regimen, including protracted dairy oral administration of UFT or 5\u0027-FDUR, Cimetidine and PSK (protein-bound polysaccharide K) as an immunomodulator or biological response modifier in conjunction with intermittent one-day continuous infusion (ADM+MMC) or intermittent single bolus injection of ADM+MMC. At present, the patient has been living in good health for almost 7 years with no evidence of relapse.\nAggressive resection surgery followed by effective adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary for surviving long time without relapse of poorly prognostic patients with metastases outside of the abdominal cavity from peritoneal papillary serous adenocarcinomas.","title":"A long-term survivor of repeated inguinal nodes recurrence of papillary serous adenocarcinoma of CUP: case report.","pubmedId":"16930493"}
