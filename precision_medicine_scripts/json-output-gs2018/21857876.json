Adequate anti-bilharzial treatment and close follow-up with urological assessments should reduce the risk of chronic ill health. This patient contracted schistosomiasis following swimming in lakes in Uganda, Africa, which resulted in azoospermia and reversible loss of libido. The couple underwent treatment at our assisted conception programme with testicular sperm extraction and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The female partner conceived in her second stimulated ICSI cycle and had a spontaneous vaginal delivery at term.","title":"Schistosomiasis-induced male infertility.","pubmedId":"21857876"}
