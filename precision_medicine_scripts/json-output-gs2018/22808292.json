The new advances and rapid-evolving practices using ALK inhibitors for therapy are also discussed at the end of this review.\nALK(+) articles published in English literature are retrieved and critically reviewed.\nALK(+) neoplasia is a rapidly growing field and the list of ALK(+) neoplasms is being expanded continuously. Accurate and correct diagnosis of ALK(+) neoplasms is of paramount importance in guiding the appropriate treatment in the era of personalized medicine using specific ALK inhibitor.","title":"ALK-immunoreactive neoplasms.","pubmedId":"22808292"}
