A characteristic of obesity is elevated circulating levels of adipocyte-derived hormone leptin. Evidence indicates that leptin plays an important role in mammary tumor formation; however, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Toward better defining the role of leptin in breast cancer, we describe the identification of leptin-regulated genes in hormone-responsive Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) human breast cancer cells using a microarray system. More than 64 leptin-regulated genes were identified including those for growth factors, cell cycle regulators, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and genes associated with metastasis. Cell cycle genes up-regulated by leptin include cyclins D and G, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, p21, p27, and p16. Leptin suppressed the expression of transforming growth factor-beta , a cell cycle suppressor. Determining the significance of this effect, treatment of MCF-7 cells with TGFB1 abrogated leptin-stimulated proliferation. Leptin up-regulated the expression of connective tissue growth factor, villin 2, and basigin, factors that are associated with ECM and are known to impact tumor growth. Finally, leptin induced the expression of anti-apoptotic genes BCL2 and survivin, and reduced the expression of apoptotic genes. The effect of leptin on MCF-7 survival was evaluated via TUNEL assay and demonstrated a sixfold reduction in apoptosis in leptin-treated cells, compared with controls. These data suggest leptin promotes mammary tumor growth through multiple mechanisms, including regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, and by modulating the extracellular environment. The identification of leptin-regulated genes begins to provide mechanistic links into the relationship between obesity and breast cancer incidence and morbidity.","title":"Leptin-regulated gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells: mechanistic insights into leptin-regulated mammary tumor growth and progression.","pubmedId":"18715880"}
