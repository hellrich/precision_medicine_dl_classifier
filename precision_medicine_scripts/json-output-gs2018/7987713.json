The positive rates of EGF, EGFR and synchronous EGF and EGFR were 35.6%, 42.3%, 30.8% respectively. The positive expression of EGF and EGFR to gastric cancer tissue was inclined to occur in patients who were in advanced stages, of poorly-differentiated types, Borrmann III, IV types, scirrhous type, seroinvasive type or lymph node metastasic types. The survival rates at 1, 3, 5 years after gastrectomy in the patients with expression of EGF were significantly lower than the survival rates of the patients with negative expression (P \u003c 0.05). The patients with synchronous expression of EGF and EGFR had the worst prognosis. After gastrectomy, all of them died within 4 years. It is indicated that EGF and EGFR could serve as biological indicators of gastric cancer malignancy and an index for evaluating, the prognosis of the patients with gastric cancer.","title":"[Clinical study on epidermal growth factor and its receptor in human gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"7987713"}
