However, a complex network of immunosuppressive mechanisms has been demonstrated to occur at the tumor site and in locoregional immune districts, such as sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The interplay between tumor cells and the local microenvironment leads to a tumor-driven shaping of the immune response that results in a heterogeneous cellular and molecular composition of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Several studies have reported the potential prognostic value of TILs infiltrating primary tumors and the association of \u0027immune signature\u0027 in SLNs and in melanoma metastases with prognosis and responsiveness to immunotherapeutic approaches. However, a systematic and deeper characterization of the local immunological status of TILs and SLNs is still required to refine melanoma stage classification.
