By upregulating the expression of ligands for inhibitory receptors on tumor specific lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment a growing malignancy can avoid immune elimination. Here we report the interaction between PDL1 status and the density of CD8+ at the tumor stromal interface in gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas (G/GEJ).  Methods:  34 invasive G/GEJ were stained for PDL1 using the 5H1 clone both at the tumor cell and associated tumor infiltrating lymphocyte/macrophages (TILs/TAMs). Tumors with greater than 5% membranous staining were considered PDL1 positive. TILs/TAMs were scored as no significant staining (0), less than 50% (focal) or greater than 50% (high). CD8+ density was determined using image analysis. Survival was evaluated according to PDL1 and CD8+ status.   Results:  4/34 tumors (12%) showed membranous PDL1 expression. 45% of G/GEJ demonstrated PDL1 expression among TILs with 27% showing focal interface expression and 18% high expression. Patients whose tumors were defined as stroma high (CD8+ \u003e 500 cells/m2) had a worse PFS, HR \u003d 3.91 (95% CI: 1.32, 11.59) p \u003d 0.01, and OS, HR \u003d 3.46 (95% CI: 1.09, 10.96) p \u003d 0.03, compared to stroma low (CD8+\u003c 500 cells/mm2). Interestingly in the stroma, 8/9 tumors (89%, CI: 51.8%, 99.7%) with high CD8+ were also positive for PDL1 while only 7/24 (29%, CI: 12.6%, 51.1%) with low CD8+ were PDL1 positive (p \u003d 0.004). PDL1 stromal expression was identified in 33.3% stage I, 53.9% stage II, 37.5% stage III, and 66.7% of stage IV tumors (p \u003d 0.51). Stromal PDL1 expression occurred in 60% of intestinal and 38.5% of diffuse tumors (p \u003d 0.45).  Conclusions:  PDL1 is expressed on both tumor cells and TILs across all stages and histologies of G/GEJ. Patients with higher CD8+ levels have higher PDL1 expression indicating adaptive resistance is occurring in the tumor microenvironment. Phase II and Phase III clinical trials investigating the efficacy of PD1/PDL1 inhibitors either alone or in combination with CTLA-4 inhibitors are currently ongoing in patients with advanced G/GEJ.","title":"Adaptive immune resistance in gastro-esophageal cancer: Correlating tumoral/stromal PDL1 expression with CD8+ cell count.","pubmedId":"ASCO_144936-156"}
