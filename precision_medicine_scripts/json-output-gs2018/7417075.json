Two cutaneous malignant melanomas (thigh and back) and an ocular malignant melanoma (ciliary body and iris) simultaneously developed. Patients with B-K mole syndrome have been known to have a very high risk for the development of cutaneous melanoma (including multiple primary cutaneous melanomas) and multiple primary malignancies. There may be a propensity in these patients for development of ocular melanomas.","title":"B-K mole syndrome. Cutaneous and ocular malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"7417075"}
