The present study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to establish candidate genes with an altered methylation status in Chinese leukemia patients. Eligible studies were identified through searching the National Center of Biotechnology Information PubMed and Wanfang databases. Studies were pooled and overall odds ratios with corresponding confidence intervals were calculated. A total of 4,325 leukemia patients and 2,010 controls from 94 studies on 53 genes were included in this meta-analysis, and 47 genes were found to be aberrantly methylated in leukemia patients. A further subgroup meta-analysis by leukemia subtype demonstrated that hypermethylation of 5 genes, namely cyclin-dependent kinase (CDKN)2A, DNA-binding protein inhibitor-4, CDKN2B, glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 and p73, contributed to the risk of various subtypes of leukemia. In addition, a strong association between CDKN2A and leukemia was identified in Chinese (P\u003c0.00001) but not in European patients. The aberrantly methylated genes identified in the present meta-analysis may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of leukemia in Chinese patients.","title":"DNA methylation and leukemia susceptibility in China: Evidence from an updated meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"27588182"}
