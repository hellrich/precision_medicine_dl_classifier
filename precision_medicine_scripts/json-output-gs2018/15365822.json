A recent report suggests that a polymorphism of the p53 tumor suppressor gene that results in the substitution of a proline residue with an arginine residue at position 72 of the p53 protein might act as a risk factor in the malignant transformation of colorectal adenoma to cancer.\nIn our study, the samples consisted of 150 patients were analyzed for the mutation in the p53 gene. The age of 150 patients (46 women and 104 men) ranged from 30 to 91 years (mean age 68.46 years).\nThe polymorphism showed 52.04% mutant in the codon 72 of exon 4 in the Taiwanese population. Both of the chi-square for trend test (chi-square \u003d 4.97, p \u003d 0.034) and logistic regression (p \u003d 0.037, odds ratio \u003d 1.699) showed significant differences in the distribution of polymorphism of codon 72 in the p53 gene and Dukes classification of colorectal cancer.\nThere were significant relationship between the polymorphism of codon 72 and the malignancy of colorectal cancer in Taiwanese population. There is 1.70 times in each grade change (Dukes A-D) more risk of CCC polymorphism than that of CCG polymorphism of codon 72 of exon 4.","title":"p53 codon 72 polymorphism and susceptibility malignancy of colorectal cancer in Taiwan.","pubmedId":"15365822"}
