This study was to explore a suitable method to dissect cervical lymph nodes for stage cN0 PTC patients.\nEighty-four stage cN0 PTC patients, diagnosed by B ultrasound or cervical MRI from 2005--2006, were randomly divided into two groups. Thyroidectomy and ipsilateral central lymph node dissection were performed in Group A, while only thyroidectomy was performed in Group B. Each group contained 42 patients. Both groups took thyroxin tablets after operation.\nAn average of 3 lymph nodes were found in each case of Group A, and the lymph node metastasis rate was 47.62%. The occurrence rates of complications were not significantly different between the two groups (P\u003c0.05).\nThyroidectomy plus ipsilateral central lymph node dissection is recommended for the treatment of stage cN0 PTC. It can also avoid damage of recurrent laryngeal nerve in re-dissection.","title":"[Application of central lymph node dissection to surgical operation for clinical stage n0 papillary thyroid carcinoma].","pubmedId":"18334122"}
