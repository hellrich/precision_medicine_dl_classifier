This predefined analysis presents outcomes by tumor HPV status. Methods: All tumor samples were centrally reviewed.  HPV status was determined using a validated immunohistochemistry assay to p16INK4A by an independent lab blinded to treatment assignments. Tumor samples were scored positive or negative according to prespecified criteria. Results: Of 657 enrolled pts (ITT), 443 (67%) had samples evaluable for HPV testing.  Ninetynine (22%) tumors were HPV+ and 344 (78%) were HPV-.  HPV+ rates varied by site (37% oropharynx, 19% larynx, 15% oral cavity, and 13% hypopharynx) and geographic region (44% N America, 22% W Europe, 21% Asia Pacific, 19% S America, and 18% E Europe).  Demographics were generally balanced except pts with HPV+ vs HPV- tumors were more often nonsmokers (31% vs 14%), had oropharyngeal tumors (47% vs 23%), and had poorly differentiated tumors (30% vs 13%).  Efficacy results are shown (Table).  Adverse events were generally balanced between HPV+ and HPV- pts. Conclusions: Pts with HPV- R/M SCCHN administered pmab + CT had improved overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS), whereas no improvement in OS or PFS was observed in pts with HPV+ tumors.ITT(n\u003d657)HPV+(n\u003d99)HPV- (n\u003d344)OSEvents - %747377HRa (95% CI)0.87 (0.73-1.05)1.00 (0.61-1.64)0.76 (0.59-0.97)P valueb0.140.980.02Median OS (pmab + CT vs CT)  - mos11.1 vs 9.011.0 vs 12.611.7 vs 8.6QITP0.253PFSEvents - %869190HRa (95% CI)0.78 (0.66-0.92)1.21 (0.76-1.92)0.67 (0.53-0.84)p-valueb0.0040.430.001Median PFS (pmab + CT vs CT)  - mos5.8 vs 4.65.6 vs 5.56.0 vs 5.1QITP0.068ORRITT(n\u003d566)cHPV+(n\u003d88)cHPV- (n\u003d297)cORR (pmab + CT vs CT) - %36 vs 2544 vs 3235 vs 27P value odds ratio0.0070.270.13Abbreviations: QITP, quantitative interaction test p-value; ORR, objective response rate. aStratified hazard ratio. bStratified log-rank test p-value. cPts with baseline measurable disease per modified RECIST 1.0.","title":"Safety and efficacy of panitumumab (pmab) in HPV-positive (+) and HPV-negative (-) recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN): Analysis of the global phase III SPECTRUM trial.","pubmedId":"ASCO_98230-114"}
