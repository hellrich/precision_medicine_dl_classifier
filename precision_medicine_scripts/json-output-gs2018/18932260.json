The median disease-specific survival (DSS) was 21.3 months, and a plateau was observed after 5 years. The median overall survival (OS) was 13.0 months. Both the median DSS and the median OS were longer for patients with stage I/II HNSCC than for patients with stage III/IV HNSCC (median DSS, not reached vs 11.4 months; P \u003c .001; median OS, 41.9 months vs 7.9 months; P \u003c .001). On multivariate analysis, stage I/II disease, treatment with curative intent, and evidence of locoregional control were independent predictors of improved survival.\nThe outcome of patients with stage I/II HNSCC aged \u003e or \u003d 80 years was similar to that of younger patients, and the current results indicated that age should not be used to deny them optimal treatment. Elderly patients with stage III/IV HNSCC had poor survival. Geriatric tools should be used to identify elderly patients who are eligible for optimal locoregional treatment.","title":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in patients aged \u003e or \u003d 80 years: patterns of care and survival.","pubmedId":"18932260"}
