Immunohistochemical staining revealed that all of the ALCL were Ki-1 positive (CD30 or Ber-H2). Of them, 5 cases were leucocyte common antigen (LCA) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) positive, 2 cases were LCA negative and EMA positive, 1 case was LCA positive and EMA negative, and the other 4 cases were both negative. Seven cases (58.3%) showed B cell markers, 2 cases (16.7%) showed T cell markers and remaining 3 cases had neither T nor B markers.\nExtranodal Ki-1 (CD30) positive ALCL has distinctive histopathologic and immunohistochemical features which help its differential diagnosis.","title":"[Clinicopathologic criteria for the diagnosis of extranodal anaplastic large-cell lymphoma: a preliminary study].","pubmedId":"11778279"}
