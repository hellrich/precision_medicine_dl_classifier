A 49-year-old male with metastatic liver tumor, who had undergone sigmoidectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy, was treated by low-dose CPT-11 chemotherapy (CPT-11 30 mg/m2 x 3 days, every 2 weeks). After 7 courses of this chemotherapy, CT and ultrasound examinations showed a reduction of tumor size in the liver. This chemotherapy also showed no high grade toxicities. Therefore, low-dose CPT-11 chemotherapy seems to be effective for metastatic colorectal cancer, and safe in view of toxicities.","title":"[A case of metastatic liver tumor of colorectal cancer responding to low-dose CPT-11 chemotherapy].","pubmedId":"12669404"}
