Cells were irradiated with C-beam and assayed for cell survival (colony-forming assay), cellular morphology (acridine orange assay), the frequency of apoptotic cells (fluorescence microscopy) and protein expression (Western blot analysis).\nThe radiosensitivity of B16/Tp53 cells was significantly higher than that of B16 cells. In contrast with Tp53 transfer alone, the combination of C-beam with Tp53 transfer induced a higher proportion of apoptotic cells and micronuclei. After C-beam irradiation, there was no significant increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and Tp53 in B16/Tp53 cells compared to B16 cells, but a decreased expression of murine double minute-2 (Mdm2) was observed.\nThe results of this study suggest the potential application of C-beam combined with Tp53 in the treatment of melanoma in human patients.","title":"Apoptosis of murine melanoma cells induced by heavy-ion radiation combined with Tp53 gene transfer.","pubmedId":"18300021"}
