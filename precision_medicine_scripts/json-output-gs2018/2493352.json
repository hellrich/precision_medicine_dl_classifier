Alkaline immunophosphatase (APAAP) and immunoperoxidase were used on cryostatic sections to stain MHC antigens. Monomorphic MoAbs were used against class I heavy chain, beta 2-microglobulin, DR, DQ and DP molecules. Class I expression was homogeneous on colon, melanoma and epidermoidal primitive tumours. Loss of HLA class I antigens was more frequent on basal cell carcinomas and sarcomas and was related to tumour differentiation on larynx carcinoma. Class I expression was heterogeneous on breast, larynx and stomach primitive neoplasias. Class I negative tumours were more frequent on metastatic than on primitive melanomas. Divergence of class I between primary tumours and autologous metastases was observed on melanomas, larynx and colorectal carcinomas. Class II expression was heterogeneous on all tumours and in a large number of cases was associated with high intensity of leukocytic infiltrate. HLA-DR expression was higher than HLA-DP and HLA-DQ (DR greater than DP greater than DQ) and was related to tumour progression. Four human tumour cell lines were modulated with recombinant interferon-gamma for HLA class I and II antigens. Different HLA profiles were obtained: increased class I and II expression, increased class II or a low response. Finally, class I genes from 22 tumours were compared with autologous normal cells by Southern blot analysis: 12 tumours were class I positive and 10 negative. No clear differences in RFLP were observed that could be associated with class I rearrangement. The results are discussed in relation to the role that histocompatibility antigens may play in tumour progression and invasiveness.","title":"Phenotypic expression of histocompatibility antigens in human primary tumours and metastases.","pubmedId":"2493352"}
