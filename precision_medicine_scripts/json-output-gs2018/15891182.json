The purpose of this study was to determine whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in line scan diffusion-weighted imaging (LSDWI) is useful for distinguishing between SCC and lymphoma of the head and neck.\nLSDWI was prospectively performed in 39 patients with SCC and in 14 patients with lymphoma. Images were obtained with a diffusion-weighted factor (b factor) of 5 and 1000 s/mm(2), and ADC maps were generated. ADC values were measured for the two types of tumor.\nMean ADC values were 0.96 +/- 0.11 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s for SCC and 0.65 +/- 0.09 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s for lymphoma; the difference was significant (P \u003c .001). All but one of the patients with lymphoma had ADC values lower than the lowest ADC (0.76 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) in patients with SCC. When an ADC of 0.76 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s was used to distinguish between SCC and lymphoma, accuracy was 98% (52 of 53 lesions).\nADC values appear to be useful for distinguishing between SCC and lymphoma in the head and neck.","title":"Usefulness of the apparent diffusion coefficient in line scan diffusion-weighted imaging for distinguishing between squamous cell carcinomas and malignant lymphomas of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"15891182"}
