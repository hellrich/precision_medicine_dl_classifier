Primary malignant melanomas of esophagus (PMME) are uncommon entities, with aggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis. The better definition of their genotype could improve therapeutic options.\nWe report a case of a 66 years old man with a PMME in the lower third of the esophagus. Analysis of c-kit, KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes resulted negative for mutations. On the basis of a computerized (PuMed/Medline) bibliography search we retrieved a total of other 35 cases of PMME analyzed for genetic alterations in RAS, BRAF, and KIT.\nWhen we compared mutations frequency of PMME with those of other mucosal melanomas, it appeared that PMME are characterized by a relative higher percentage of NRAS mutations.\nPMME seem to show a specific pattern of genetic alterations suggesting that they could represent a distinct entity among mucosal melanomas.","title":"Genetic mutations in primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus: case report and literature review.","pubmedId":"26484880"}
