The bcr/abl mRNA was detected in 22 out of 33 patients in clinical complete remission after BMT. The bcr/abl mRNA was present only transiently in 6 patients. It was speculated that leukemia cells were not eradicated by conditioning therapy of BMT, but patients maintained clinical complete remission due to GVL (graft versus leukemia) effect. Further study is necessary to estimate the clinical value of this technique to predict the outcome in CML patients.","title":"[Molecular analysis of bcr/abl mRNA in chronic myelogenous leukemia after bone marrow transplantation by using RT-PCR method].","pubmedId":"1602606"}
