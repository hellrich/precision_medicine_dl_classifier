We analyzed the value of BRAF V600mut ctDNA from plasma as a monitoring tool for advanced melanoma patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors.\nAllele-specific quantitative PCR analysis for BRAF V600 E/E2/D/K/R/M mutations was performed on DNA extracted from plasma of patients with known BRAF V600 mutant melanoma who were treated with dabrafenib and trametinib.\n245 plasma samples from 36 patients were analyzed. In 16 patients the first plasma sample was obtained before the first dosing of dabrafenib/trametinib. At baseline, BRAF V600mut ctDNA was detected in 75 % of patients (n \u003d 12/16). BRAF V600mut ctDNA decreased rapidly upon initiation of targeted therapy (p \u003c 0.001) and became undetectable in 60 % of patients (n \u003d 7/12) after 6 weeks of treatment. During treatment, disease progression (PD) was diagnosed in 27 of 36 patients. An increase of the BRAF V600mut ctDNA copy number and fraction, identified PD with a sensitivity of 70 % (n \u003d 19/27) and a specificity of 100 %. An increase in the BRAF V600mut ctDNA fraction was detected prior to clinical PD in 44 % of cases (n \u003d 12/27) and simultaneously with PD in 26 % of patients (n \u003d 7/27).\nQuantitative analysis of BRAF V600mut ctDNA in plasma has unique features as a monitoring tool during treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Its potential as an early predictor of acquired resistance deserves further evaluation.","title":"Quantitative assessment of BRAF V600 mutant circulating cell-free tumor DNA as a tool for therapeutic monitoring in metastatic melanoma patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors.","pubmedId":"27095081"}
