Clubbing was more common in women (40%) than in men (19%; chi2 test p \u003d 0.011), and was more common in patients with NSCLC (35%) than those with SCLC (4%; chi2 test p \u003d 0.0036).\nIn a prospective study, digital clubbing was less frequently observed in men than women and in patients with SCLC than NSCLC. These clinical observations may assist in the initial evaluation of patients for planning workup and therapy.","title":"Digital clubbing and lung cancer.","pubmedId":"9872183"}
