Prior to her admission, she was on maintenance with the ALL-BFM95 study protocol for 10 months that does not contain corticosteroids. On physical examination, central obesity and moon face appearance were determined. Laboratory tests revealed high morning ACTH, cortisol level, and 24-h urinary free cortisol level. Morning cortisol level was 33.94 nmol/L after a 2-day (4 Ã— 0.5 mg) dexamethasone suppression test. A lumbar puncture revealed leukemic cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. No pituitary adenoma was detected on magnetic resonance imaging. We diagnosed the patient with ACTH-dependent CS related to leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system.\nCentral nervous system infiltration should be considered in leukemic patients who have developed CS. We believe increased leukemia inhibitory factor levels may be a factor for CS in our patient with ALL.","title":"Cushing syndrome related to leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system: a case report and a possible role of LIF.","pubmedId":"23729555"}
