Genomic DNA from 78 newly diagnosed AML from August 2010 to October 2012 was screened by PCR and sequencing or capillary electrophoresis (CE) for NPM1, FLT3 and c-KIT mutations. The results showed that the incidence of NPM1 mutation was 14.1% in AML patients and 26.7% in normal karyotype AML patients. NPM1 mutant cases were significantly associated with old age (P \u003c 0.05), high peripheral white cell count and platelet counts (P \u003c 0.05) and low expression of CD34 (P \u003c 0.05), but no statistic difference was found in sex, percentage of bone marrow blasts, Hb, expression of CD117 and HLA-DR, complete remission rate, overall survival and relapse rate (P \u003e 0.05). The prevalences of FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutations were 11.5% (9/78) and 3.8% (3/78) respectively, and no one patient has both of the two mutations. Patients with FLT3-ITD mutation had higher white blood cell counts and percentage of in bone marrow blasts (P \u003c 0.05), and lower overall survival (P \u003c 0.05), more relative to normal karyotype (P \u003c 0.05), while no statistic difference was found in sex, age, platelet count, Hb level, complete remission rate and relapse rate (P \u003e 0.05). No statistic analysis was performed due to the cases of less FLT3-TKD mutation. C-KIT mutation accounts for 7.7% (6/78). Patients with C-KIT mutation had a higher percentage in abnormal karyotype (P \u003c 0.05), and higher relapse rate (P \u003c 0.05), and lower overall survival, whereas no statistic difference was found in sex, age, percentage of bone marrow blasts, peripheral blood cell count, complete remission rate (P \u003e 0.05). It is concluded that the detection of NPM1, FLT3 and C-KIT mutations may contribute to guiding treatment and evaluating prognosis of patients with AML.","title":"[Detection of NPM1, FLT3 and C-KIT mutations in acute myeloid leukemia and their prognostic analysis].","pubmedId":"23815906"}
