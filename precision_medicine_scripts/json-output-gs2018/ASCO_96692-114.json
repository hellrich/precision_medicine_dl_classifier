{"publicationTypes":["2012 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background:  Adjuvant chemotherapy in operable non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been shown to improve overall survival in many meta-analysis. The use of cisplatin and gemcitabine combination is considered one of the standard regimens for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC, with mild side effects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility and toxicity of the cisplatin-gemcitabine combination in adjuvant setting.  Methods:  Resected NSCLC patients who met criteria for recommending adjuvant chemotherapy received treatment with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine 1.200 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of each 21 days cycle. A maximum of four cycles were delivered. Main objectives were clinical feasibility, drug delivery, and efficacy.  Results:  From November-2004 to July-2011 a total of 89 patients (73 male/16 female, median age 57) were included. Surgery: lobectomy 62.9%, pneumonectomy 29.2%, bilobectomy 5.6%, wedge resection 2.2%. Tumor stages: 19.1% IB, 55.1% II, 23.6% III, 2.2% IV; histology: 48.3% squamous, 43.8 % adenocarcinoma, 3.4 % large cell carcinoma and 4.5% NSCLC not otherwise specified. ECOG 0: 62.9%, ECOG 1: 37.1%. Toxicity: grade 3/4 neutropenia 19.1%/6.7 %; grade 3 febrile neutropenia 3.4%; grade 3/4 anaemia 6.7%/1.1%; grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia 6.7%/4.5%; grade 3 ototoxicity 1.1%; no grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity was reported. There was one toxic death. Compliance: 85.4% of the patients received 4 cycles of the combination chemotherapy. Cisplatin dose intensity was 24.6 mg/m2/wk and gemcitabine dose intensity was 773.6 mg/m2/wk. Median overall survival and progression free survival has not yet been reached. With a median follow up of 36 months, 77.5% of the patients are still alive and 61.8% without documented relapse. Reported 3 year overall survival in patients with ECOG 0 was 82%, and in patients with ECOG 1 54%, being this difference statistically significant.  Conclusions:  Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine in adjuvant setting is safe and feasible with a good toxicity profile. Those patients with ECOG 0 benefit most. Our data are similar to those obtained in previously reported trials.","title":"Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine in resected non-small cell lung cancer: A single institutional experience.","pubmedId":"ASCO_96692-114"}
