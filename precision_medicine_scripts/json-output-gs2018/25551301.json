The stains were interpreted semi-quantitatively.Staining for CD43 and CD117 was significantly more common in ACC than in BCC. Forty percent of ACCs showed staining for CD43, while no cases of BCC were positive. CD117 was positive in all cases of ACC, with 93% showing moderate or strong staining. BCC were less frequently positive, with only 20% of cases showing labelling of weak or moderate intensity.Immunohistochemical positivity for CD117 and CD43 are likely to be helpful adjuncts in the separation of cutaneous ACC from adenoid BCC.","title":"CD117 and CD43 are useful adjuncts in the distinction of adenoid cystic carcinoma from adenoid basal cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25551301"}
