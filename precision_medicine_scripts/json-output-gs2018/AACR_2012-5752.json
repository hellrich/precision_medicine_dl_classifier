Adiponectin is one of the most abundant adipokines with pleiotropic roles in metabolism and in the development and progression of cancer. This study aimed to investigate the possible association between the expression of adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) and clinicopathological variables in papillary thyroid cancer. We found that levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were commonly increased in thyroid cancer compared with adjacent normal thyroid tissues. Thyroid cancer cells expressed AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, which were attenuated by histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. We determined the expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 by immunohistochemical staining in primary tumor samples and metastatic lymph nodes. AdipoR1 was expressed in 27% of primary tumors and AdipoR2 in 47%. AdipoR1 expression correlated with AdipoR2 expression in primary tumors and in metastatic lymph nodes. Tumor AdipoR1 expression was associated with larger tumor size, whereas negative AdipoR2 expression was significantly associated with extrathyroidal invasion and multicentricity. Patients in the high AMES risk group had negative tumor expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. Collectively, altered expression of adiponectin receptors in thyroid cancer supports a potential role in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer.","title":"Expression and biological significance of adiponectin receptors in papillary thyroid carcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5752"}
