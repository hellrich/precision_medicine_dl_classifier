Gilteritinib (ASP2215) is a highly selective FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against FLT3-ITD mutations. It also inhibits FLT3-D835 mutations that can confer clinical resistance to other FLT3 inhibitors. A phase 1/2 study of gilteritinib in relapsed/refractory AML showed favorable tolerability across a wide dose range and consistent, potent, FLT3 inhibition in correlative assays. Cohort expansion in FLT3-mutated patients generated an overall response rate of 55% (CR/CRp/CRi \u003d 44%, PR \u003d 11%) and survival that was longer than in prior reports of cytotoxic chemotherapy or other FLT3 inhibitors. Therefore, a phase 3 trial was initiated. Methods: This randomized phase 3 study (NCT02421939) will enroll 369 adult AML subjects at ~140 centers across North America, Europe, and Asia. Subjects must be in first relapse or refractory to frontline therapy and have a centrally confirmed FLT3 mutation. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to treatment with either 120 mg gilteritinib QD or to investigators pre-randomization choice of specified salvage chemotherapy. Randomization will be stratified by prior chemotherapy response and salvage chemotherapy regimen intensity. Subjects randomized to gilteritinib or low-intensity chemotherapy will receive continuous 28-day cycles until a discontinuation event occurs; high-intensity chemotherapy subjects will receive up to 2 cycles before response measurement. The primary objective is OS; key secondary objectives are event-free survival and complete remission (CR) rate. Other secondary objectives include leukemia-free survival, remission duration, composite CR rate, subsequent transplantation rate, patient-reported fatigue, and overall safety. A formal interim analysis is planned after ~50% of deaths have occurred. Study enrollment began October 23, 2015; as of February 1, 2016, 10 subjects have been randomized.
