{"publicationTypes":["2010 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: Few data are available about the use of erlotinib in the real life in France for patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The objective of this epidemiological study was to describe the use of erlotinib out of clinical trials. Methods: An epidemiological multicenter observational study was conducted in 35 french centers. The study was retrospective (starting from September 2006 to September 2008), with a follow-up period of one year. The main objective was to describe the progression free survival (PFS), according to the indication and to patients\u0027 subgroups. Results: 497 patients have been included in the study, 30 (6%) in first-line treatment, 177 (36%) in second line, 239 (48%) in third line, 43 (9%) in other and 8 (2%) in maintenance indication. The histological types were as follows: 304 (62%) adenocarcinoma, 99 (20%) squamous cell carcinoma, 60 (12%) large cell carcinoma and 30 (6%) others. Erlotinib was given to 311 (63%) male and 186 (37%) female. The indications were as follows: 7 (2%) post surgical stage II-III NSCLC, 31 (7%) locally advanced NSCLC, 417 (91%) advanced NSCLC. Conclusions: Erlotinib was approved in Europe as a second line treatment for patients who had progressed after at least one regimen of chemotherapy in September 2005. This study showed that erlotinib is used in different indications but preferentially as a second line treatment in male patients with adenocarcinoma. Updated descriptive data, safety profile, outcome including PFS and clinical predictive factors will be reported at the meeting.
