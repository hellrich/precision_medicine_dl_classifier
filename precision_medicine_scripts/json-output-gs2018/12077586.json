The number of reported cases is small with several ascribed etiologies. We review the literature and report the first documented case, to our knowledge, of pigment-synthesizing melanoma in an infant. Reported cases of congenital and infantile melanoma were identified and categorized on the basis of disease origin. Dermatopathologic specimens from an infant given a diagnosis of pigment-synthesizing melanoma are described. Disease arising from medium and large/giant congenital nevi was most common, whereas reports of de novo and transplacental disease were infrequent. Death of approximately 40% of patients was noted within 18 months of diagnosis. Male infants accounted for approximately 74% of cases. The most commonly affected anatomic sites were the head and neck. The prognosis for congenital and infantile melanoma is poor. The high incidence of head-and-neck involvement and male predominance for disease suggest dispositions for both anatomic disease localization and sex.","title":"Congenital and infantile melanoma: review of the literature and report of an uncommon variant, pigment-synthesizing melanoma.","pubmedId":"12077586"}
