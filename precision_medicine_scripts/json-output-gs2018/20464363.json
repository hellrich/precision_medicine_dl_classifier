Here we describe for the first time the synchronous manifestation of a squamous cell carcinoma and a follicular lymphoma of the palatine tonsil. Histomorphologic and etiopathogenetic characteristics are described and discussed on the basis of the current literature. The coincidence of a lymphoma and a squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck area is an oncologic rarity as well as an interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.","title":"[Simultaneous squamous cell carcinoma and follicular lymphoma of the tonsil].","pubmedId":"20464363"}
