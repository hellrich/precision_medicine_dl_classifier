In the multi-pollutant model, the effect of the every 105.43 Âµg/m(3) increase of ambient PM10 had a larger impact on the daily death of the cerebrovascular diseases with statistically significant difference (P \u003c 0.05). The effect of ambient PM10 pollution on daily death of cerebrovascular diseases was significant for females, 65 year-olds and in winter season.\nOur data showed that elevated levels of ambient PM10 was positively associated with the increase of cerebrovascular disease mortality. The elevated levels of ambient PM10 could lead to the increase of the daily mortality on cerebrovascular diseases for females, elderly who were 65 or older and in winter seasons.","title":"[The impact of ambient particulate matter (PM10) on the population mortality for cerebrovascular diseases-a case-crossover study].","pubmedId":"23937835"}
