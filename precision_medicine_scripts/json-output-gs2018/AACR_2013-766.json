MYCN amplification and its over-expression are associated with the worst neuroblastoma disease outcome. Non-MYCN amplified neuroblastomas express high-levels of MYC, and prognosis of these neuroblastomas is very poor. Melanoma and malignant pheochromocytoma are also known for high MYC expression. Interestingly, these neural crest derived tumors characteristically express the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This feature can be used to specifically target the tumor cells with agonists of NET, such as Meta-Iodo-BenzylGuanidine (MIBG). In the previous AACR meeting, we presented our finding that non-radio-labeled MIBG can suppress growth of neuroblastoma cells in vitro, and this effect is in part related to its ability to destabilize MYC and MYCN. We have also shown that FCCP, a well-known mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, destabilized MYCN and MYC in neuroblastoma cells and caused growth suppression. Recently, it has been reported that Phenformin, a Type II diabetic drug, binds NET, suggesting that NET positive cells preferentially uptake Phenformin. It is also known that Phenformin inhibits the mitochondrial electron transfer system. In this study, we have investigated a possible effect of Phenformin on growth and MYC/MYCN stability in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. SKNBE(2)C and CHP134 neuroblastoma cell lines were treated with various doses (0-2.5mM) of Phenformin for two days. MTS assay was used to assess the effect of Phenformin on growth of the cells. There was a dose-dependent growth suppression of the NB cell lines tested. Phenformin was more effective against growth of SKNBE(2)C than CHP134 cells. The effect of Phenformin on MYC/MYCN expression in four neuroblastoma cell lines [SKNBE(2)C, CHP134, SKNAS, and SY5Y] was also examined by Western blot assay. SKNBE(2)C and CHP134 express MYCN, whereas SKNAS and SY5Y express MYC at high levels. Treatment of these cells with Phenformin at the dose of 1mM for 24 hours resulted in destabilization of MYCN/MYC, suggesting that the growth suppressive effect of Phenformin on neuroblastoma cells was in part due to reduction in MYC/MYCN expression. We are currently examining whether the above observations made in neuroblastoma are also applicable to other neural crest derived tumors. In addition, we are investigating how Phenformin-related mitochondrial dysfunction causes destabilization of MYC/MYCN in neuroblastoma cells.","title":"Phenformin is a MYCN/MYC destabilizer that can specifically target neural crest derived tumors.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-766"}
