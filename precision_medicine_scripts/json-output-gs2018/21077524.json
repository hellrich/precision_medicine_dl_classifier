The aim of this study is to describe the prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) results in predicting cardiac events and mortality in \u003e or \u003d 60-year-old females.\n49 women (\u003e or \u003d 60 years old) who were referred for DSE were included in the study. Data including CAD risk factors, and results of tests and a follow-up of events (MI, unstable angina, progression of CHF) and death.\nEleven patients were considered to have a positive DSE result. There was no difference between DSE (+) and DSE (-) patients in cardiac events and cardiac death. However when interventions were included to events, analysis showed DSE (+) to have more overall events. Non-cardiac deaths and \"all deaths\" were 11 and 8 times more common among DSE (+) patients compared with DSE (-) patients p \u003c 0.01. Multivariable logistic regression showed that diabetics and DSE (+) patients were 32 (p \u003d 0.01) and 23 (p \u003d 0.02) times more likely to have an event compared with non-diabetics and DSE (-) patients, respectively.\nDSE is a safe procedure to be used in \u003e or \u003d 60-year-old female patients and can provide informative prognostic information regarding all-cause deaths and cardiac events (including interventions) over a 4-year period. In addition we find that diabetes is a strong predictor of events regardless of DSE result.","title":"Diabetes supersedes dobutamine stress echocardiography in predicting cardiac events in female patients.","pubmedId":"21077524"}
