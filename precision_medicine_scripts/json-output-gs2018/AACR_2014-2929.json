MYCN amplification is the major genetic aberration in high-risk neuroblastoma and is associated with poor outcome. Genome-wide association studies have identified activation mutations and high-level amplification of ALK in approximately 10% of neuroblastoma patients. In addition, ALK mutations can coexist with MYCN amplification, which defines a subset of ultra-high-risk neuroblastoma patients. In contrast to the high frequency of p53 mutations observed in many human cancers of adults, mutations of p53 are less common in childhood cancers and have been reported in less than 2% of neuroblastomas. Wild-type (WT) p53 is required for the activation of p53 signaling by Mdm2 inhibitors. This suggests that neuroblastoma could be amenable to intervention with Mdm2 inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrated that the ALK inhibitor, NVP-LDK378, in combination with a novel Mdm2 inhibitor, NVP-CGM097, promoted apoptosis in ALK mutant and p53 WT neuroblastoma cell lines. NVP-LDK378 inhibited ALK phosphorylation and NVP-CGM097 caused induction of p53 and its downstream target genes in these cell lines. Meanwhile, Mdm2 inhibition in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines significantly decreased the levels of Mycn protein. In addition, NVP-LDK378 and NVP-CGM097 combination resulted in complete tumor regression and markedly prolonged survival in neuroblastoma xenograft models. Overall, NVP-LDK378 and NVP-CGM097 combination may provide an effective treatment for ALK mutant and p53 WT neuroblastoma patients.","title":"The Mdm2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097 enhances the anti-tumor activity of NVP-LDK378 in ALK mutant neuroblastoma models","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2929"}
