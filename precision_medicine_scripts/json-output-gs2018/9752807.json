We recently experienced a case of sarcomatoid HCC removed from a 49-year-old man. A surgically resected liver revealed a well-defined grayish-white solid firm mass showing extensive central necrosis and infiltrative growth margin. Microscopically, the entire tumor was composed of pleomorphic spindle cells with prominent nucleoli and frequent mitosis. It showed a sinusoidal infiltrative growth pattern at the tumor-nontumor boundary. The tumor cells reacted positively with AE3 (high molecular cytokeratin) and Vimentin and reacted negatively with AE1 (low molecular cytokeratin), cytokeratin19, carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha-fetoprotein, Factor VIII, CD31 and CD68. The spindle-shaped tumor cells were considered to originate from hepatocyte rather than from bile duct epithelium or mesenchymal elements.","title":"A case with sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"9752807"}
