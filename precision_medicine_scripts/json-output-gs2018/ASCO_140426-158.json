The up-front detection of BRAF mt is not standardized beyond the boundaries of research. However, since novel emerging specific therapies are increasingly available in clinical trials, the prior determination of this mutation is now warranted.  Methods:  From 07/2010 to 01/2014, 581 patients (pts) with advanced refractory mCRCunderwent genetic tumor profiling as part of the VHIO Phase I Trial Molecular Prescreening Program. BRAF mt was determined by Sanger sequencing or multiplex PCR and mass detection (MassARRAY, Sequenom) of 268 frequent hotspots in 25 oncogenes including, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA. PTEN status was also assessed by immunohistochemistry.  Results:  581 samples were analyzed detecting BRAF mt in 56 (9.6%). In the BRAF mt population, median age was 61 years (45-80) and 54% had right-sided CRC. Metastatic sites were found at: liver 61%;  peritoneum 52%; lung 39%. Median number of standard treatment was 4 (0-8) including cetuximab and/or panitumumab in 73%. BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 53 samples whereas V600K, D594V and D594G were seen in one sample each. PTEN was analyzed in 44.6% of samples resulting in low expression (H-score \u003c50) in 56%. Other co-existing mutations were PIK3KCA H1047R, PIK3CA E545K, NRAS G12V, GNAS R201C and EGFR S768I. 22 pts were enrolled at least in one phase I trial with drugs targeting either BRAF alone (n\u003d12) or combined with anti-EGFR (n\u003d5), MEK (n\u003d2), PI3K (n\u003d1) inhibitors or double MEK/PI3K inhibition (n\u003d2). Partial responses (PR) were seen in 3 pts (2 with BRAF inhibitor and EGFR inhibitor and 1 with BRAF inhibitor as a single agent).  Conclusions: BRAF mt mCRC pts in our institution have a similar pattern to other series reported. Notably, PTEN low expression was present in almost half of the samples analyzed and other co-existent mutations in the ERK and PI3K pathways were detected. This observation, coupled with the clinical outcome observed with single agent BRAF inhibition in this population, suggests that these patients may derive greater benefit from dual BRAF and either EGFR, MEK or PI3K inhibition.","title":"Clinical and molecular characterization of refractory BRAF mutant metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC): Vall dHebron Institute of Oncology phase I program cohort.","pubmedId":"ASCO_140426-158"}
