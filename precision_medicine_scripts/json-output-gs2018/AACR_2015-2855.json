We evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects of nivolumab on immune endpoints in patients (pts) with advanced melanoma in an exploratory phase 1 study (NCT01621490).Methods: 85 pts (41 and 44 anti-CTLA-4 therapy-nave and refractory, respectively) received nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV Q2W in 56-day cycles. Tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline (B/L) and on treatment during Cycle 1, Week 4 (C1Wk4). Response was assessed during the last week of each cycle. The primary objective was to evaluate the pharmacodynamic activity of nivolumab on immune biomarkers, including circulating T-cell subsets (by multiparametric flow cytometry), serum interferon (IFN) and IFN-induced factors (by multiplex immunoassay), and T-cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (by immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD4, CD8, PD-1 and FOXP3). Secondary objectives included safety, efficacy, and the association between tumor PD ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and clinical responses.Results: Across all 85 pts, the objective response rate was 25%, with 2 pts having a confirmed complete response. The safety profile was consistent with prior nivolumab monotherapy trials. Of 85 pts, 34 had evaluable biopsies at B/L and C1Wk4. Increases in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at C1Wk4 relative to B/L were seen in most pts; 65% of pts had an increase in CD3+ T cells. Expression of other TIL markers CD4, CD8, FOXP3 and PD-1, correlated well with one another and CD3 after treatment (C1Wk4; r \u003d 0.69-0.93, P\u003c0.0001). Increased TIL, in particular CD3+ and CD8+, was associated with response; 100%/88% of responders had elevated CD3+/CD8+ TILs compared with 54%/58% of non-responders. PD-L1 expression was not consistently modulated between B/L and C1Wk4 (30 matched samples); however, highest PD-L1 expression (C1Wk4) was accompanied by highest TIL levels (C1Wk4). No consistent change in the frequency of activated peripheral T-cell subsets (HLA-DR+ or ICOS+, CD4 and CD8 T cells) was seen with nivolumab treatment, but peripheral increases in serum IFN--stimulated cytokines were observed. Mean concentrations of serum CXCL9 and CXCL10 increased 2.2- and 1.1-fold from B/L, respectively, 43 days after initial dose; no association was apparent between the increases and response.Conclusions: Nivolumab monotherapy is marked by increased TIL, inclusive of cytotoxic CD8 T cells, and FOXP3+ T regulatory cells and these increases are associated with response. Unlike ipilimumab, nivolumab treatment does not demonstrate consistent increases in circulating activated T cells. However, increases in peripheral IFN--stimulated cytokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10 are observed, presumably derived from the tumor microenvironment. Further characterization of the effects of nivolumab on the tumor microenvironment is ongoing.","title":"Immunomodulatory activity of nivolumab monotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2855"}
