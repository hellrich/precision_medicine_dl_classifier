A 145-kilodalton tyrosyl phosphoprotein observed in rapid response to HGF treatment of intact target cells was identified by immunoblot analysis as the beta subunit of the c-met proto-oncogene product, a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase. Covalent cross-linking of 125I-labeled ligand to cellular proteins of appropriate size that were recognized by antibodies to c-met directly established the c-met product as the cell-surface receptor for HGF.","title":"Identification of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor as the c-met proto-oncogene product.","pubmedId":"1846706"}
