Key search terms included trastuzumab, lung cancer, Herceptin, and NSCLC.\nResearch has revealed that NSCLC specimens may express the protein HER-2/neu. The monoclonal antibody against HER-2/neu, trastuzumab, could prove valuable for patients. An evaluation of the studies exploring trastuzumab for management of NSCLC was conducted. Phase II clinical trials reveal variable response rates from no improvement to a partial response rate of 42%. Due to a lack of clinical trials and deficiencies in the literature, the ultimate benefit of this agent remains to be proven.\nClinical data from ongoing trials indicate potential synergy when trastuzumab is added to standard chemotherapy. The ultimate benefit in NSCLC remains to be proven.","title":"Trastuzumab for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"14632535"}
