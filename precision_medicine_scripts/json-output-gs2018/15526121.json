Group A (n \u003d 28) had no second recurrence, and group B (n \u003d 17) had second local recurrence after surgery for recurrence.\nThe mean follow-up period after reoperation was 56.9 months. The mean age at the time of reoperation in group A was significantly lower than that in group B, at 48.1 years versus 62.3 years, respectively (P \u003d 0.0007). The mean age at the time of the initial operation in group A was also significantly lower than that in group B, at 40.1 years versus 55.1 years, respectively (P \u003d 0.0006). Patients with recurrent tumors only outside the area dissected at the initial operation (n \u003d 27) had a better outcome than those with recurrence within the dissected area (n \u003d 18; P \u003d 0.0127). Patients who underwent systematic partial or modified neck dissection (n \u003d 36) had a better outcome than those who underwent only simple local resection (n \u003d 9; P \u003d 0.0169).\nFor local recurrent PTC, systematic neck dissection is recommended over local resection of recurrent tumors.","title":"Prognosis after reoperation for local recurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"15526121"}
