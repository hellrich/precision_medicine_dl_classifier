Preoperative creatinine clearance (Ccr), eGFR, and pre- and postoperative serum creatinine (sCr) data were examined. Preoperative Ccr and eGFR were then compared for their reliability in predicting postoperative renal dysfunction.\nAmong 110 patients with normal preoperative Ccr values, 7 (6.3%) had abnormal postoperative sCr values, and among 112 patients with normal preoperative eGFR values, postoperative sCr was abnormal in 5 (4.5%) (P \u003d 0.53). Among 37 patients with abnormal preoperative Ccr values, 30 (81.1%) had normal postoperative sCr values, and of 35 patients with abnormal preoperative eGFR values, postoperative sCr was normal in 25 (71.4%) (P \u003d 0.34). Preoperative Ccr was significantly correlated with eGFR (r \u003d 0.514), and postoperative sCr was significantly correlated with preoperative Ccr (r \u003d -0.334) and eGFR (r \u003d -0.02).\nPreoperative eGFR is as effective as Ccr for predicting postoperative renal dysfunction. eGFR should therefore be used as an indicator of preoperative renal function in place of Ccr since it is a cheaper and easier to perform test.","title":"eGFR is a reliable preoperative renal function parameter in patients with gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"20480529"}
