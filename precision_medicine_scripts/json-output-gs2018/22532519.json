We retrospectively analyzed 324 patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with front-line induction chemotherapy between October 2004 and March 2010. Fifty-six patients had FLT3-ITD mutation at diagnosis. Fifty-one (91%) patients with FLT3-ITD achieved complete remission. Thirteen patients had FLT3 analysis at complete remission. None had FLT3-ITD. Twenty-five (49%) patients with FLT3-ITD relapsed. Of these, 13 (52%) had FLT3-ITD at relapse (3 negative and 9 not done). Among the 201 patients without FLT3-ITD at diagnosis who achieved complete remission, 77 (38%) relapsed among whom 8 (10%) patients acquired FLT3-ITD clone. We conclude that FLT3-ITD mutations are unstable at follow up and may occur for the first time at relapse. Therefore, FLT3-ITD is not a reliable marker for minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia.","title":"Activating internal tandem duplication mutations of the fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3-ITD) at complete response and relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"22532519"}
