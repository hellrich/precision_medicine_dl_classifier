We report here a case of familial angiolipomatosis, which was initially though to be neurofibromatosis, and the occurrence in this patient of a granular cell tumor similar to such tumors occasionally seen in neurofibromatosis. A review of the literature discloses intriguing parallels between familial angiolipomatosis and neurofibromatosis, suggesting that similar pathogenetic mechanisms may operate in both diseases.","title":"Autosomal dominant familial angiolipomatosis clinically mimicking neurofibromatosis.","pubmedId":"2518515"}
