Immunohistochemistry and GenoArray HPV genotyping assays were used to evaluate the HPV infection status of 256 Chinese patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Long-term survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Immunostaining for p16 was prevalent in 6.6% (17/256) of patients, whereas HPV infection was detected in 9 of 256 (3.5%) patients using the HPV genotyping test. None of the p16-negative subjects were found to have HPV infection according to the HPV genotyping test. P16 positivity was more common among nonsmokers than smokers (16.3% vs. 4.7%, respectively; P \u003d 0.02). Among nine HPV-positive cases, seven were infected with HPV-16, one with HPV-33, and one with both HPV-16 and HPV-11. The 3-year overall survival rate was 87.5% for p16-positive/HPV-positive patients, 75.0% for p16-positive/HPV-negative patients, and 76.9% for p16-negative/HPV-negative patients (P \u003d 0.30). A very low rate of HPV infection was found among the study patients. HPV infection status may not be a useful prognostic marker for head and neck cancer patients.","title":"Low prevalence of human papillomavirus in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in Chinese patients.","pubmedId":"25156555"}
