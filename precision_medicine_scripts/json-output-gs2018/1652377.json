Results indicated: (1) The total positive rate for CEA was 80.4%. Expression of CEA had no relation to clinical staging and tumor size. (2) The CEA expression of adenocarcinoma was more than that of squamous cell carcinoma. (3) The CEA expression of metastatic lesions was consistent with that of their primary tumors. (4) The CEA positive rates of bronchial epithelium gradually increased along with their pathological changes becoming serious.","title":"[Immunohistochemical study of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in non small cell carcinomas of the lung and bronchial epithelium adjacent to tumors].","pubmedId":"1652377"}
