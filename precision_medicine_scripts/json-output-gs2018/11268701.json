Hashimoto\u0027s thyreoiditis was diagnosed and three tumors were found: oncocytic carcinoma, malignant lymphoma and papillary carcinoma. In the right lobe, oncocytic carcinoma and high grade malignant lymphoma composed of cells with irregular, lobulated nuclei were found. The lymphoma was confined to the thyroid gland. The oncocytic carcinoma invaded the capsule and the surrounding tissues.
