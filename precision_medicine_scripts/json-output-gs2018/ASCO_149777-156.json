MET expression is common in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas (HNSCC) (Seiwert et al, Cancer Res 2009). We compared the oral MET inhibitor tivantinib (ARQ197) (T) in combination with cetuximab (C), with C monotherapy, in patients (pts) with recurrent/metastatic (r/m) HNSCC.  Methods:  78 cetuximab-nave pts after platinum failure were enrolled from 2012-2014, 40 on the T+C arm, and 38 on the C control arm. 31 pts (40%) were HPV-positive/p16-positive oropharyngeal (OP) cancers. T was given orally 360mg BID, C 500mg/m2 every two weeks. Cross-sectional imaging was performed every 8 weeks. Primary outcome was response rate (RECIST 1.1), and secondary outcomes included survival.  Results:  In 75 pts currently assessable for response, the response rate in the T+C arm was 8.5% (N \u003d 3, including one CR), and 5.3% (N \u003d 2) in the C alone arm (NS). Of note the response rate in HPV-positive/p16-positive oropharyngeal HNSCC pts was 0% in both arms in a combined 31 HPV-positive/p16-positive OP HNSCC. The response rate in HPV-negative pts was 12.5% (T+C)/ 8.5% (C) (NS). Median PFS in both arms was 4 months (NS), median OS 8 months (NS). Both treatments were well tolerated with a trend towards increased hematological toxicities in the T+C arm (12.5% of pts experience grade 3 leukopenia).  Conclusions:  Tivantinib + Cetuximab given in an unselected population of r/m HNSCC pts does not significantly improve response rate and survival. Consistent with other recent reports (Fayette et al ESMO 2014; Machiels et al ESMO 2014), EGFR inhibitors, including cetuximab appear to be less active/inactive in HPV-positive/p16-positive oropharyngeal HNSCC patients.
