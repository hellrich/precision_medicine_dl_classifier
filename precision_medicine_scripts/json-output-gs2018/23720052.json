To investigate this further, we have used a transgenic mouse model of ErbB2-driven tumor progression (ErbB2(KI) model) that recapitulates clinically relevant events, including selective amplification of the core erbB2 amplicon. By comparing the transcriptional profiles of ErbB2(KI) mammary tumors and human ERBB2-positive breast cancers, we show that ErbB2(KI) tumors possess molecular features of the basal subtype of ERBB2-positive human breast cancer, including activation of canonical β-catenin signaling. Inhibition of β-catenin-dependent signaling in ErbB2(KI)-derived tumor cells using RNA interference impaired tumor initiation and metastasis. Furthermore, treatment of ErbB2(KI) or human ERBB2-overexpressing tumor cells with a selective β-catenin/CBP inhibitor significantly decreased proliferation and ErbB2 expression. Collectively, our data indicate that ERBB2-mediated breast cancer progression requires β-catenin signaling and can be therapeutically targeted by selective β-catenin/CBP inhibitors.","title":"β-Catenin signaling is a critical event in ErbB2-mediated mammary tumor progression.","pubmedId":"23720052"}
