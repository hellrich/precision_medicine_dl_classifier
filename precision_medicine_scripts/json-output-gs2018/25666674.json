However, our understanding of pediatric melanomas is still rudimentary. In this report, we comment on a thorough multi-platform analysis of common pediatric melanoma subsets, including pediatric conventional melanoma (CM), congenital nevus-derived melanoma (CNM), and Spitzoid melanoma (SM), contributed by Lu et al.","title":"Unfolding the mutational landscape of human melanoma.","pubmedId":"25666674"}
