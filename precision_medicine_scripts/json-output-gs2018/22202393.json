After 2 courses of NAC, radical resection of the esophageal carcinoma was performed. Primary tumor was not palpable, and lymph node swelling was not found in the resected specimens. Pathologic examination of the resected specimens revealed no malignant cells in the esophagus. Histologic effect of the NAC was grade 3. We obtained down-staging of carcinoma in T0N0M0, fStage 0. CASE 2: A 58-year-old man with thoracic esophageal cancer, T3N2M0, cStage III, underwent NAC with 5-FU/CDDP. After 2 courses of NAC, radical resection of the esophageal carcinoma was performed. Primary tumor was not found in the resected specimens. Pathologic examination of the resected specimens revealed only an irregular fibrosis of esophageal wall, and no malignant cells in the esophagus. Two lymph node metastasis and surrounding fibrosis was found. We obtained down-staging of carcinoma in T0N2M0, fStage II. We report two cases of complete response of primary esophageal carcinoma treated with 5-FU/CDDP as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","title":"[Two cases of complete response of primary esophageal carcinoma treated with 5-FU/CDDP as neoadjuvant chemotherapy].","pubmedId":"22202393"}
