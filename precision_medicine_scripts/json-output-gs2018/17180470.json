In this report, to establish a more efficient treatment for immunotherapy against prostate cancer, the construct was transfected into B16F10 to generate gene-modified tumor cell vaccine (named B16F10-SLC-3P-Fc). In poorly immunogenic B16F10 mouse melanoma model, the immunization with B16F10-SLC-3P-Fc resulted in a strong antitumor response and 50% of tumor-bearing mice achieved long-term survival (\u003e120 days). In vivo depletion of lymphocytes indicated that CD8(+) T cells were involved in the direct tumor killing, whereas CD4(+) T lymphocytes were required for the induction of CD8(+) CTL response in B16F10-SLC-3P-Fc-immunized mice. Splenocytes from B16F10-SLC-3P-Fc-immunized mice specifically recognized and lysed PSM, PAP, PSA, and 3P expressing tumor cells. The combined therapy of B16F10-SLC-3P-Fc plus anti-B7-H1 MAbs further enhanced the immune response. Rechallenge experiment showed that a persistent memory response was successfully induced by the combined therapy. These observations suggest pSLC-3P-Fc-modified tumor cells could serve as a vaccine against prostate cancer, and the therapy combined with anti-B7-H1 MAbs further enhanced the antitumor immune response.","title":"Potent systemic antitumor immunity induced by vaccination with chemotactic-prostate tumor associated antigen gene-modified tumor cell and blockade of B7-H1.","pubmedId":"17180470"}
