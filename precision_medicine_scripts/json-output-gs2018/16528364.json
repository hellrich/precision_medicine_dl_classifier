However, more reliable prognostic markers are needed that allow a better stratification of patients, especially with regard to therapeutic options. Here, a retrospective study was performed on patients with primary superficial-spreading melanoma (SSM, n\u003d44) or nodular melanoma (n\u003d16) of 1.5-4 mm thickness. Thirty patients had survived the follow-up of 10 years, whereas the other 30 patients developed metastases. Tumor sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of regulators of the cell cycle (p21; retinoblastoma protein (pRb)), of the intrinsic or extrinsic proapoptotic pathways (p53; murine double minute gene 2 protein; tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-R1/DR4; TRAIL-R2/DR5) and of Bcl-2-related proteins (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bax, Bak, Bok), which regulate the common mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In SSM, decrease of Bax and Bak was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis: high Bax was associated with 10-year survival rates of 68%, whereas low Bax resulted in only 26% survival, and high Bak was associated with 10-year survival rates of 62%, whereas low Bak resulted in only 10% survival. Regulators of apoptosis may therefore candidate for independent prognostic markers for primary melanomas. The study underlines the particular role of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and of proapoptotic Bcl-2-related proteins for melanoma progression.","title":"Loss of proapoptotic Bcl-2-related multidomain proteins in primary melanomas is associated with poor prognosis.","pubmedId":"16528364"}
