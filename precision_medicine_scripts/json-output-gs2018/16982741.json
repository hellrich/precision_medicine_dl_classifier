Because aberrant CD30 expression was also observed in the T-cell lymphoma derived from lineage-specific NPM-ALK transgenic mice, we tested the hypothesis that there might be a functional relationship between the two neoplastic-related proteins: NPM-ALK and CD30. In this study, we used the RNA interference method to modulate NPM-ALK protein expression in ALCL-derived, t(2;5)-positive Karpas 299 cells. We observed decreased CD30 expression when NPM-ALK was repressed. Further analysis suggested that JunB functioned as the mediator of NPM-ALK-derived CD30 transcriptional regulation. The NPM-ALK-repressed cells, which had low CD30 expression, were characterized with lower cell proliferation compared with cells in the control group, suggesting that altered CD30 expression may correlate to NPM-ALK-mediated tumor cell growth inhibition. Combination of NPM-ALK repression and CD30 ligand leads to significantly increased tumor cell growth inhibition compared with one method alone, suggesting its potential application for ALCL-specific cancer treatment.","title":"The expression of CD30 in anaplastic large cell lymphoma is regulated by nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase-mediated JunB level in a cell type-specific manner.","pubmedId":"16982741"}
