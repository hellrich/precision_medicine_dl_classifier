The tumor suppressor p53 induces growth arrest or apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. Along with its growth-suppressive effect, it has been reported that p53 stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway via the upregulation of heparin- binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, and discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a tyrosine kinase receptor, at the transcription level. In this study, we propose a novel mechanism involved in the p53-induced MAPK activation. Nutlin-3 induced the phosphorylation of EGFR, MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells harboring wild-type p53. This phosphorylation was completely inhibited by p53 siRNA, but not by pifithrin (PFT)-α, an inhibitor of the trans-criptional activity of p53. While the nutlin-3-induced EGFR phosphorylation was prevented by the inactivation of ERK1/2, the nutlin-3-induced MEK1/2-ERK1/2 phosphorylation was still observed in the cells in which EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited using EGFR siRNA and AG1478, an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase. Of note, nutlin-3 caused the accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and this correlated with the mitochondrial translocation of p53. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO), a ROS scavenger, prevented the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. PFT-μ, which prevented the mitochondrial localization of p53, suppressed ERK1/2 phosphorylation, as well as ROS accumulation. Finally, we analyzed the effect of ERK1/2 activation on nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. The knockdown of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity using U0126, a MEK inhibitor, or siRNAs, resulted in the enhancement of nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. In addition, TEMPO and PFT-μ also promoted nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. Taking the above findings into account, it can be concluded that nutlin-3 activates ERK1/2 prior to EGFR phosphorylation via ROS generation following the mitochondrial translocation of p53 and that nutlin-3-induced ERK1/2 activation may play a role in protecting U2OS cells from p53-dependent apoptosis, constituting a negative feedback loop for p53-induced apoptosis.","title":"ERK1/2 activation mediated by the nutlin‑3‑induced mitochondrial translocation             of p53.","pubmedId":"23314357"}
