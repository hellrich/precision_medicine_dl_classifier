CTL were generated from tumor-involved nodes by in vitro stimulation, initially with autologous melanoma cells and subsequently with allogeneic A2.1+ melanoma cells. These CTL lysed autologous melanoma plus four allogeneic HLA-A2.1+ melanomas, including an HLA-A2.1-transfected melanoma. K562, HLA-A2- melanomas and HLA-A2+ nonmelanomas were not lysed. HLA-A2.1 molecules were purified from human melanoma cell lines by immunoaffinity column chromatography of detergent-solubilized cell pellets. Peptides bound to the MHC molecules were acid eluted and fractionated by reversed phase HPLC. Individual fractions were assessed for their ability to reconstitute melanoma-specific epitopes by addition to the HLA-A2.1+ Ag-processing mutant, 721.174XCEM.T2 (T2). Five peaks of reconstitution were observed. Second dimension HPLC separations of reconstituting fractions revealed evidence for two distinct reconstituting peptides within one of these peaks. Based on these data, a minimum of six distinct peptides associated with HLA-A2.1 and recognized by melanoma-specific CTL are present on these different melanoma lines. These data document the presence of multiple peptide-defined CTL epitopes that are shared by at least three unrelated human melanoma cell lines.","title":"Recognition of human melanoma cells by HLA-A2.1-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes is mediated by at least six shared peptide epitopes.","pubmedId":"7681084"}
