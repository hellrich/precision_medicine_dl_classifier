In the human, L1 is expressed on tumors derived from neurocrest and on certain carcinomas. We have analyzed immunohistochemically L1 expression on paraffin embedded specimens of acquired melanocytic nevi, primary cutaneous melanomas, and cutaneous and lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas. We found an increase in L1 immunoreactivity in malignant melanomas and metastases of malignant melanomas as compared to acquired melanocytic nevi that was statistically significant (P\u003c0.05). Additionally, a correlation of L1 immunoreactivity with histological data of prognostic value such as Clark level and the expression of alphav-integrins was found. We detected soluble L1 in the conditioned medium of cultivated melanoma cells but only in 1/40 serum samples from a panel of melanoma patients representing various stages of disease. Our findings suggest that the presence of L1 might contribute to tumor progression by promoting cell adhesion and migration.","title":"L1 adhesion molecule (CD 171) in development and progression of human malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"12490317"}
