Of them, 30 metastatic patients who had regular follow-up by liver function tests (LFTs) and liver imaging were included in this study. Eighty nonmetastatic patients were randomly chosen as controls.\nThe medical records of the metastatic and control groups were reviewed documenting LFTs and liver imaging results.\nThe mean level of each LFT, its sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio at various time periods before the detection of metastases by liver imaging.\nAt the time of diagnosis of liver metastases by imaging, 50% of patients had at least one abnormal LFT (compared with only 5% of the control group). While no change was noted in the mean serum levels of bilirubin, mean lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline-phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma GTP) aspartate-aminotrasferase, and alanine-aminotrasferase levels seem to rise, even within normal limits, during the 6 months before the detection of metastases. Based on likelihood ratios, alkaline-phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase were the most predictive tests. Lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate-aminotransferase were already predictive at 80% of the upper normal limit, whereas alkaline-phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase were most predictive at the upper normal limit.\nMonitoring the changes in selected LFTs, even within normal limits, can help predict metastatic uveal melanoma.","title":"Liver function tests in metastatic uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"14962411"}
