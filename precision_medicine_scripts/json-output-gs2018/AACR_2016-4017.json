BRAFV600E mediated-MAPK pathway activation is associated in melanoma cells with IFNAR1 down-regulation. IFNAR1 regulates melanoma cell sensitivity to IFN, a cytokine currently used for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma patients. These findings in conjunction with limited therapeutic efficacy of BRAF-I prompted us to examine whether the efficacy of IFN therapy of melanoma harboring BRAFV600E can be increased by its combination with BRAF-I. Methods. BRAF/NRAS genotype, ERK activation, IFNAR1 and HLA class I antigen expression were tested in 60 primary melanoma tumors of treatment nave patients. The effect of BRAF-I on IFNAR1 expression was assessed in 3 melanoma cell lines and in 4 tumor biopsies of BRAFV600E metastatic melanomas. The anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic and immunomodulatory activity of BRAF-I and IFN combination was tested both in vitro and in vivo utilizing 3 melanoma cell lines, HLA class I antigen-MA derived peptide complex-specific T cells and immunodeficient mice (5 mice /group for mice survival and 10 mice/group for inhibition of tumor growth). All statistical tests were two-sided. Differences were considered statistically significant when the P value was \u003c0.05. Results. IFNAR1 level was statistically significantly (P\u003c0.001) lower in BRAFV600E primary melanoma tumors than in BRAF wild type tumors. IFNAR1 down-regulation was reversed by BRAF-I treatment in the 3 melanoma cell lines (P0.02) and in 3 out of 4 tumor biopsies from metastatic melanoma patients. IFNAR1 level in the melanoma tumors analyzed was increased as early as 10-14 days following the beginning of the treatment. These changes were associated with i) an increased susceptibility in vitro of melanoma cells to the anti-proliferative (P0.04), pro-apoptotic (P0.009) and immunomodulatory activity, including induction of HLA class I antigen APM component (P0.02) and MA expression as well as recognition by cognate T cells (P\u003c0.001), of BRAF-I and IFN combination, and ii) an increased mice survival (P\u003c0.001) and inhibition of tumor growth of melanoma cells (P\u003c0.001) in vivo by BRAF-I and IFN combination. Conclusions. The results of this study provide a strong rationale for the novel clinical trials implemented in BRAFV600E melanoma patients with BRAF-I and IFN combination","title":"Anti-tumor activity of a BRAF inhibitor and IFN combination in BRAF mutant melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4017"}
