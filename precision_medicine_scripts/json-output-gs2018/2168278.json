Malignant melanoma was proved by biopsy, but patient refused any treatment. He visited our hospital again when bloody vomitus was noted two months later. Chest P-A revealed multiple lung metastases, and marked liver metastasis was also found by abdominal echo. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) panendoscopy revealed multiple melanotic nodules with ulcerations at the tip, scattering diffusely on the fundus and upper body of the stomach. Metastatic malignant melanoma was proved by endoscopic biopsy. Metastatic tumor of the stomach was rare, and the endoscopic finding of the malignant melanoma with gastric metastasis was more rarer in the literature in Taiwan. So we would like to present the very rare finding of the endoscopy.","title":"[Malignant melanoma metastatic to the stomach: upper G-I endoscopic finding--report of a case].","pubmedId":"2168278"}
