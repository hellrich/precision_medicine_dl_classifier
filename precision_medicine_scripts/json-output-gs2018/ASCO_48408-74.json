C634R and M918T occur in the cysteine-rich and kinase domain, respectively, and therefore activate RET by differing mechanisms. V804L, a mutation at the putative RET gatekeeper residue, has demonstrated resistance to several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in vitro. Notably, with other tyrosine kinases, mutations in the kinase domains or gatekeeper residues alter drug sensitivity. We evaluated the effect of these RET mutations on the response to TKIs in a cell based system. Methods: CHO cells expressing WT and mutant RET proteins were treated with a panel of TKIs consisting of compounds in preclinical development (DP-2490 and DP-3636) and drugs being studied for treatment of MTC in clinical trials (axitinib, motesanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, vandetanib). Drug sensitivity was determined by inhibition of RET kinase phosphorylation and IC50s were calculated using photodensitometry. Results: The IC50s of each TKI against the different RET mutants are presented in the Table. WT RET was most sensitive to all of the TKIs. DP-2490 and DP-3636 had IC50s \u003c 1 nM against WT RET, and demonstrated superior potency against all of the RET mutants tested. All drugs tested were at least 5-fold more potent against C634R than M918T. V804L demonstrated complete resistance to axitinib, motesanib, and vandetanib at 5,000nM, but demonstrated increased sensitivity to the other compounds when compared to M918T. Conclusions: RET kinase is a therapeutic target for the treatment of MTC. Here, we demonstrate that RET kinase inhibition differs by RET genotype and kinase inhibitor. These findings are similar to those in other malignancies, and suggest that MTC tumor genotype may be predictive of response to individual TKIs that target RET. DP-2490 and DP-3636 represent the most potent RET inhibitors described to date and should be studied further for the treatment of MTC.
