These thyroid neoplasms display distinctive clinicopathological features and generally show good prognostic outcome. Recently, unusual sporadic tumours that share the morphological features of FAP-associated thyroid carcinomas have also been described. In this report, we document a case of a thyroid tumour in a previously well, 46-year-old female. Histology revealed a circumscribed neoplasm composed of tubular, papillary, cribriform and solid areas. The pseudostratified columnar tumour cells showed occasional nuclear grooves and rare nuclear inclusions. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining with antibodies to cytokeratin AE1/AE3, oestrogen and progesterone receptor proteins. Focal immunoreactivity was also noted with antibodies to thyroglobulin, epithelial membrane antigen, 34betaE12 and cytokeratin CK7. The absence of polyps on colonoscopy and germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene provides evidence that this tumour represents the sporadic counterpart of FAP-associated thyroid carcinoma. The patient is well with no evidence of disease 7 months following resection of the tumour. The differential diagnoses and molecular genetics of this unusual tumour are discussed.","title":"Cribriform-morular variant of papillary carcinoma: the sporadic counterpart of familial adenomatous polyposis-associated thyroid carcinoma.
