MEN 2 is caused by germline mutations in the ret proto-oncogene. We investigated the feasibility of using the DHPLC technique in mutation detection of the ret gene in members of MTC families. We compared DHPLC analysis with direct sequencing with regard to sensitivity, reliability, cost and time.\nExons 10 and 11 were amplified with PCR from forty-three samples in seventeen unrelated Greek families and were analyzed for mutations by DHPLC and DNA sequencing.\nEight PCR amplicons showed a distinct non-wild-type DHPLC profile. Sequence analysis confirmed different nucleotide variations: six of them were localized in exon 10 and two in exon 11. Mutations were detected in five out of seventeen families tested (29%).\nNone of the alterations detected by direct sequencing was missed by DHPLC. We conclude that DHPLC is a fast, sensitive, cost-efficient and reliable method for the scanning of ret germline mutations.","title":"Efficient testing of the RET gene by DHPLC analysis for MEN 2 syndrome in a cohort of patients.","pubmedId":"16158949"}
