{"genes":["TP53","EGFR"],"publicationTypes":["2017 ASCO Annual Meeting Abstracts"],"abstract":"Background: Brain metastases are often a late complication of cancer, not easily amenable to biopsy, and may contain additional molecular alterations not found in the original tumor. We sought to analyze the concordance between tissue DNA and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients who developed brain metastases, and determine how the ctDNA profile changed with time. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 31 patients with brain metastases who underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) from both ctDNA and tumor tissue DNA. Breast, lung, ovarian, renal, melanoma, and colon primaries were included (42, 32, 13, 7, 3, and 3%, respectively). Tissue DNA was from primary tumor, systemic metastasis or brain (39, 39, and 7%, respectively). A median number of five alterations was found in each tissue group. Alterations in ctDNA were compared to tumor DNA and analyzed for relative frequencies, concordance, and novel alterations. Overall survival (OS) and time between DNA sample collections was analyzed. Results: All 31 patients had detectable mutations in tumor tissue. 25 patients (80.6%) had detectable ctDNA alterations and 14 patients (45.2%) had at least one identical ctDNA alteration that was concordant with tissue DNA. The most commonly altered genes (in both ctDNA and tissue DNA) were TP53 and EGFR. Breast cancer had both the highest proportion of patients with  1 ctDNA alterations (92.3%) and the highest proportion of patients who had  1 alterations in common with tissue DNA (61.5%). 23 of the 25 patients (92%) with detectable ctDNA alterations had additional alterations not found in tissue DNA, which increased with time from tumor DNA sampling. Median time between ctDNA extraction and tissue biopsy was 6.5 months for cases with common alterations, and 12.4 months for those without common alterations. There was trend to decreased OS with increasing ctDNA burden. Conclusions: We found that ctDNA is comparable with tissue DNA sequencing in patients with brain metastases. This concordance decreases with increasing time from tissue diagnosis, reflecting the changing nature of tumor genetics and highlighting the utility of ctDNA as a feasible way to monitor changes and identify additional potentially targetable alterations.","title":"Comparison of tissue DNA to circulating tumor DNA in patients with brain metastases.","pubmedId":"ASCO_194957-199"}
