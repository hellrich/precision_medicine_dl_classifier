We assessed the potential association of selected WT1 SNPs as well as WT1 mutations in normal karyotype (NK)-AML and evaluated the prognostic value of these normal gene variants. Diagnostic samples from a series of 474 young adult NK-AML patients were used to genotype five WT1 SNPs using TaqMan assays and to directly sequence WT1 exons 7 and 9. Analysis of five WT1 gene variants showed an association of rs2234593 allele C with WT1 Ex7 mutation. Prognostic study of the same variants identified rs2234593 significantly associated with relapse and overall survival (OS). Patients with rs2234593AA/AC showed significantly higher 10-year OS (50 vs 36 %, hazard ratio (HR) \u003d 0.69 (0.52–0.90), p \u003d 0.006) and lower cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (36 vs 51 %, HR \u003d 0.62 (0.45–0.86), p \u003d 0.004) compared to those with rs2234593CC. The effect of AA genotype on CIR remained significant after adjustment for basic covariates including FLT3 internal-tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutations (HR \u003d 0.60 (0.41–0.89), p \u003d 0.009), with some evidence of improved survival (HR \u003d 0.75 (0.55–1.03), p \u003d 0.07). A multivariate analysis showed WT1 Ex7-mutant as the major relapse predictor, with a tendency for rs2234593-A effect after allowing for Ex7 mutation (p \u003d 0.07). No adjusted risk benefit was found for previously reported rs16754-G. In conclusion, WT1 normal gene variant rs2234593 is associated with mutational status of WT1 Ex7 and is a further prognostic marker independent from FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations in NK-AML.","title":"The Wilms Tumor-1 (WT1) rs2234593 variant is a prognostic factor in normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"26499507"}
