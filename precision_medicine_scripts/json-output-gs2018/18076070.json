Oral administration of gefitinib to female transgenic mice from 5 to 14 weeks of age reduced tumor multiplicity from 9.6 +/- 0.82 to 0.58 +/- 1.1 (83%). We observed a decrease in the number and size of lobules and lobular nodules in treated mice with a reduction in the overall disease burden per gland. Normal duct development in the mammary glands was not affected by gefitinib. The development of acinic cell carcinoma in the parotid glands of these animals was also reduced coincident with decreased stromal involvement during progression. Gefitinib eliminated phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3 and signaling through MAPK and Akt in lobular hyperplasias and carcinomas. At the same time MAPK activity and cytokine production in splenocytes and lymph nodes was increased in gefitinib-treated animals coincident with an increase in lymph node size. Delaying gefitinib treatment until mammary glands exhibited atypical lobular hyperplasias reduced efficacy. These studies demonstrate the critical role of HER2 signal transduction in the onset and progression of HER2/neu-dependent breast cancer and suggest a role for specific inhibitors to prevent the outgrowth of early hyperplastic disease.","title":"Gefitinib prevents cancer progression in mice expressing the activated rat HER2/neu.","pubmedId":"18076070"}
