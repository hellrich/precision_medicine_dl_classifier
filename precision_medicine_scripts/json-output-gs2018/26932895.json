Up to now, fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of thyroid has been acknowledged to discriminate benign from malignant thyroid nodules with the highest sensitivity and specificity. However, 10% to 40% thyroid nodules cannot be discriminated by FNAB. Therefore, it is vitally important to look for highly-correlated tumor makers in molecule level. BRAF mutation is a focus in thyroid cancer research, and some studies showed that this mutation is essential to the onset and development of thyroid cancer, especially papillary thyroid cancer. Joint detection of BRAF mutation could improve diagnostic sensitivity of thyroid cancer, which is crucial for thyroid cancer diagnosis and classification. As for treatment, the discovery of target gene enabled molecule therapy for thyroid cancer, raising hopes for patients with thyroid cancer that refractory to conventional treatments. Currently, many molecule therapeutics relating to BRAF has already undergone clinical trials. It is believed that further research on BRAF-thyroid cancer relationship could create a new field for diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer, and set a mode for discovering others molecule markers.
