We tested depleting Tregs as immunotherapy using anti-CD25 (high-affinity IL-2R subunit) antibodies (αCD25) in ID8agg mouse ovarian cancer (OC). αCD25 reduced ascites and Treg numbers but failed to reduce tumor burden, possibly because it depleted newly activated anti-tumor T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Thus, αCD25 could be novel malignant ascites palliation, but has limited stand-alone efficacy. We then tested IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes (IL-2c) that selectively stimulate medium-affinity (CD122/CD132) IL-2R thought to expand anti-tumor T cells preferentially, but with little Treg effects. In contrast to several single agents we tested that failed to treat ID8agg (e.g., αCD25, αPD-L1, IL-2 fusion toxin denileukin diftitox), IL-2c alone durably reduced ID8agg tumor burden despite lowering the tumor microenvironmental CD8+/Treg ratio. Thus, we hypothesized that IL-2c improved CD8+ function, reduced Treg function, or both. IL-2c increased polyfunctional IFN-γ+TNF-α+ anti-tumor T cells as expected, an effect that persists weeks after drug clearance. IL-2c also increased anti-tumor T cell CD25 expression that increased IL-2 sensitivity and STAT5 phosphorylation, a likely mechanism for increased polyfunctionality. Unexpectedly, IL-2c reduced the Treg functional mediators CD25, TIGIT and granzyme B, and reduced Treg suppressive function. Thus, favorable Treg modifications are a novel IL-2c mechanism of action. Adding αCD25 to IL-2c to deplete Tregs further unexpectedly worsened IL-2c efficacy in ID8agg and reduced effector memory T cells and polyfunctional T cells in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a previously unappreciated role for CD25 in IL-2c therapy. Similar data were seen in B16 melanoma, suggesting αCD25 reduction of IL-2c efficacy is not tumor or compartment-specific (ID8agg is peritoneal and B16 is subcutaneous). αPD-L1, an ineffective monotherapy in ID8agg, combined with IL-2c to promote complete responses, suggesting potential for potent, novel combinatorial approaches. Our data suggest that antagonizing high affinity IL-2R (such as to deplete Tregs with αCD25) has limited cancer immunotherapy utility without more specific Treg targeting. In contrast, stimulating medium-affinity IL-2R with CD122-selective IL-2c has great translational promise by simultaneously improving beneficial anti-tumor T cells and reducing detrimental Treg function.","title":"CD122-selective IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes reduce regulatory T cell function and promote CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality for durable ovarian cancer immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-1608"}
