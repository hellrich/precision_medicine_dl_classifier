We tested the hypothesis that distinct somatic mutation profiles underlie the histologic subtypes of melanoma and that these differences are retained as melanoma progresses to metastatic disease. We reasoned that this might provide a basis for histology-driven targeted therapy, a concept that is more developed in other types of solid tumors but not in melanoma.  Methods:    We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on 8 pairs of metastatic tumor and germline DNA from 3 superficial spreading (SSM), 3 nodular (NM) and 2 acral lentiginous (ALM) melanoma patients. For two of the NM patients we also performed WES on DNA from corresponding primary lesions. Tumor DNA was isolated from FFPE samples in quantities that facilitated an average coverage of 100X for 95% of the exon regions; on average, 60M reads per sample were obtained, without applying whole genome amplification. We performed variant calling using paired samples with Somatic Sniper, SAM tools and MuTect. We annotated all the variants and applied functional filters to come up with a candidate list of mutations.  Results:    Our analysis confirmed known mutations that occur predominantly in each subtype (BRAF V600E more prevalent in SSM than in NM and absent in ALM, ALM being NF1 mutant but not BRAF V600E or NRAS Q61 mutant) and further revealed subtype-restricted somatic mutations in genes not previously reported as associated with melanoma. In particular, matrix-remodeling associated 5 was found to be frequently mutated in the SSM samples tested but not in the ALM or NM samples, and PFN1P2 (profilin 1 pseudogene) in NM samples but not in the ALM or SSM samples. Sanger sequencing is underway to validate the presence of the selected mutations in a larger independent cohort of patient specimens representing the 3 histologic subtypes.  Conclusions:  Our data support our hypothesis that melanoma histologic subtypes are characterized by distinct mutational signatures. Results of the expanded cohorts will be required to reveal uncommon, but specific mutations for each subtype that have yet to be identified.","title":"Molecular underpinning of melanoma histologic subtypes in the metastatic setting.","pubmedId":"ASCO_135077-144"}
