However, it is unknown whether the effects are also present in thyroid cancer cells and the mechanisms are not well uncharacterized. We sought to explore the effects of lidocaine and bupivacaine on thyroid cancer cells in terms of cell growth, colony formation, cell cycle, induction of apoptosis, and mitochondrial injury. At 24 hour, lidocaine had an IC50 value of 6.8 mM to 7.3 mM, whereas bupivacaine had an IC50 value of 1.3 mM to 3.1 mM. In search for a molecular mechanism, based on microarray and pathway analysis, we determined that apoptotic activity is mediated by the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Our data suggest that induction of apoptosis by local anesthetics has the potential to improve the regional control of thyroid cancer.","title":"c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) are involved in local anesthetics-induced apoptosis in human thyroid cancer cells.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-2948"}
