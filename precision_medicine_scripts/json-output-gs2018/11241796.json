In five of 17 DMBA-induced rat sarcomas, cytogenetic analysis had disclosed homogeneously staining regions (hsrs), which are generally accepted to be cytogenetic signs of gene amplification. Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), regional increases in DNA copy number of the proximal part of rat chromosome (RNO) 4 were detected in four of the tumors harboring hsrs. Amplification of the Hgfr/Met oncogene, located at RNO4q21.2, was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in five tumors. In four of them, a number of flanking genes located in the close vicinity of Hgfr/Met, including Cav1 (q21.1), Wnt2 (q21.2-q21.3), and Cftr (q21.3), also were amplified, though amplification was seen in a lower fraction of the cells than was Hgfr/Met amplification. In the fifth tumor (BL150T), Hgfr/Met was amplified in all cells and was the sole amplified gene of those tested. In addition, the Hgfr/Met FISH signals in BL150T were tightly clustered and formed compact and intense spots compared with the signals seen in the other four tumors. Application of the free chromatin FISH technique to BL150T showed that the genomic Hgfr/Met probe stained the extended chromatin fibers of up to 1.5 Mb with an almost uninterrupted signal, indicating that the BL150T amplicon was build up solely of Hgfr/Met gene sequences. Our results suggest that the Hgfr/Met oncogene is the primary target for amplification in a subset of rat DMBA sarcomas.","title":"Hgfr/Met oncogene acts as target for gene amplification in DMBA-induced rat sarcomas: free chromatin fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of amplicon arrays in homogeneously staining regions.","pubmedId":"11241796"}
