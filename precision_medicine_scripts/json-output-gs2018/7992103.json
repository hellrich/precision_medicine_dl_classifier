In patients with good operative risk, surgery is still considered the ideal treatment. Patients with coexisting major medical conditions in whom resective surgery is precluded may benefit from several therapeutic options, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) with porfimer sodium (Photofrin; manufactured by Lederle Parenterals, Carolina, Puerto Rico, under license from Quadra Logic Technologies, Inc, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), dilation, thermal destruction, Nd:YAG laser ablation, injection therapy, and placement of prosthetic tubes. Photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium is thought to have a direct toxic effect on malignant cells via the production of singlet oxygen, which damages the microvasculature of the tumor and renders it ischemic. The 630 nm wavelength used for clinical PDT exhibits the greatest relative degree of light penetration into tissue, with corresponding activation of retained photosensitizer. The efficacy of PDT with porfimer sodium is closely related to stage of disease. It should be emphasized that PDT has been shown to be potentially curative in patients with early, noninvasive tumors of both squamous and glandular (adenocarcinoma) histologies. Eighty-three patients with esophageal carcinoma were treated using PDT. At presentation, 60% of patients had recurrence following previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Patients with less advanced disease had a better response to PDT with regard to relief of dysphagia and prolongation of survival. Photodynamic therapy was found to be more useful than Nd:YAG laser therapy for high, upper third lesions, especially circumferential ones. For tumors larger than 8 cm, PDT was twice as effective as Nd:YAG laser therapy in establishing prolonged lumen patency, especially for adenocarcinomas. Photodynamic therapy appears to have the added advantages of fewer treatments and less pain. The role of PDT in gastrointestinal malignancies continues to evolve.","title":"Photodynamic therapy and cancer of the esophagus.","pubmedId":"7992103"}
