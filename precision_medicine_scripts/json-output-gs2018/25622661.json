The chi-squared test was used to assess associations between SCC-Ag levels and TNM classification. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the hazard ratio of SCC-Ag at different sites for death, and it was analyzed as a continuous variable.\nThe median serum level of SCC-Ag was 1.1 ng/ml (range 0-20). SCC-Ag was significantly higher in patients with advanced T and N classification tumors. Primary sites in the oral cavity, in the hypopharynx, advanced T and N classification, distant metastasis, and SCC-Ag were negatively associated with survival in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that SCC-Ag was a significant risk factor for overall survival in cancers of the oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx, but not in oropharyngeal cancer.","title":"Prognostic significance of serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen in patients with head and neck cancer.","pubmedId":"25622661"}
