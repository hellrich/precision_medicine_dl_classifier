In 1984-1986 the mortality of malignant neoplasm was 163.28/10(5), (Chinese standard mortality were 116.57/10(5), the world standard mortality were 177.75/10(5)) which accounts for 25.04% of the total mortality during the same time. The trends of deaths from neoplasms show that oesophageal cancer in both sexes and leukemia in male are gradually decreasing, lung cancer in male and hepatoma in female are gradually increasing. The rank correlation analysis between chinese standard mortalities of some major malignant neoplasms indicates that the stomach cancer was positive correlated with oesophageal cancer in both sexes, the oesophageal cancer in male and the stomach cancer in female were negative correlated with lung cancer, and the breast cancer was negative correlated with oesophageal cancer in female. All this suggests that there may be likely etiologic association between these malignant neoplasms.","title":"[The mortality of patients with malignant tumors in eleven cities of Jiangsu Province, 1984-1986].","pubmedId":"1863949"}
