Children with NBCCS also have a predisposition for secondary cancers after exposure to ionising radiation. In children undergoing imaging for posterior fossa mass and/or maxillofacial cysts, certain additional findings can raise the possibility of NBCCS. Making the diagnosis can significantly impact patient management, especially for children with medulloblastoma.","title":"Neuroimaging of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) in children.","pubmedId":"23151728"}
