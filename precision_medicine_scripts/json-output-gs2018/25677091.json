We sought to determine the prevalence of HPV and p16(INK4a) expression in Australian HNSCC patients and to identify predictors of HPV-positivity.\nWe recruited 248 HNSCC patients with histologically confirmed primary SCC of the oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx or larynx diagnosed between 2004 and 2010. All patients completed a questionnaire. Clinical data were abstracted from medical records. HPV presence in paraffin-embedded tumours was determined by PCR, and expression of p16(INK4a), p21(WAF1), p53, pRB, cyclin D1, and Ki67 by immunohistochemistry.\nFifty (20%) patients were HPV-positive, 63 (28%) overexpressed p16(INK4a), and 44 (19%) were positive for HPV and p16(INK4a) (high concordance between HPV-positivity and p16(INK4a) status, Îº\u003d0.72). HPV-16 was most common (84%), followed by HPV-18 (10%), HPV-33 (4%) and HPV-69 (2%). HPV and p16(INK4a) prevalence was highest for SCCs of the oropharynx, followed by hypopharynx, larynx and oral cavity (HPV and p16(INK4a)p\u003c0.0001). HPV prevalence and p16(INK4a)-overexpression were significantly higher in younger than older patients (HPV p\u003d0.001; p16 (INK4a)p\u003d0.003). Heavy smokers had lower HPV prevalence than non- or moderate smokers (p\u003d0.017). Gender and alcohol consumption were not associated with HPV or p16(INK4a) status. HPV-positive tumours had significantly lower cyclin D1 and higher p21(WAF1) expression than HPV-negative tumours.\nHPV prevalence and p16(INK4a)-overexpression were highest in oropharyngeal tumours, younger patients, and non-smokers.","title":"Human papillomavirus status and p16(INK4A) expression in patients with mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in Queensland, Australia.","pubmedId":"25677091"}
