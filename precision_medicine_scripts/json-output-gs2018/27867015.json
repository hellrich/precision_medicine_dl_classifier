CMTM3 knockdown promotes metastasis of gastric cancer via the STAT3/Twist1/EMT signaling pathway. Strong epidermal growth factor receptor1 (EGFR) expression is significantly associated with tumor metastasis and poor outcomes of gastric cancer patients. In this paper, we show that CMTM3 suppresses epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated migration and STAT3 signaling, downregulates EGFR expression via accelerating EGFR degradation in gastric cancer cells. CMTM3 colocalizes with early endosome markers Rab5 and EEA1. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay further confirms that CMTM3 interacts with Rab5. More importantly, CMTM3 markedly increases Rab5 activity. The suppressive effects of CMTM3 on EGFR expression and EGF-mediated migration can be abrogated by the siRNA against Rab5. Finally, we found that the C-terminal region of CMTM3 plays more important roles in the tumor suppressive effects of CMTM3. Overall, this study demonstrates that CMTM3 decreases EGFR expression, facilitates EGFR degradation, and inhibits the EGF-mediated tumorigenicity of gastric cancer cells via enhancing Rab5 activity.","title":"CMTM3 decreases EGFR expression and EGF-mediated tumorigenicity by promoting Rab5 activity in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"27867015"}
