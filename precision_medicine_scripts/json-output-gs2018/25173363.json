HER2 positivity of the primary tumor and liver metastases showed good concordance (87.5 %) in patients with liver metastases. In contrast, the EGFR positivity rate of metastatic tumors (70.1 %) in patients with peritoneal metastases was significantly higher than that of metastatic tumors (37.5 %) in patients with liver metastases. HER2 and EGFR expression tended to be mutually exclusive, and HER2/EGFR double-positive cases were rare in patients with liver or peritoneal metastases. In four such patients with HER2/EGFR double-positive primary tumors, the HER2- and EGFR-positive areas were separate, and corresponding liver metastasis was only positive for HER2 and peritoneal metastasis only positive for EGFR.\nThese results indicate that HER2 and EGFR are preferentially expressed in the liver and peritoneal metastases, respectively, which would be potential targets for anti-HER2 and anti-EGFR molecular therapy in metastatic gastric cancer patients.","title":"Preferential HER2 expression in liver metastases and EGFR expression in peritoneal metastases in patients with advanced gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"25173363"}
