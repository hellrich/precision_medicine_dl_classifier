The case was a 71-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with vomiting and anorexia. Abdominal US study showed obstructive jaundice. The PTCD tube was pierced to dilate the intrahepatic bile duct. Bile juice cytology was class V. Abdominal CT showed paraaortic lymph node metastasis. Angiography revealed portal vein invasion, and the diagnosis was unresectable common bile duct cancer. We started anticancer therapy and radiation. The anticancer therapy selected was MMC, LEUCOVORIN, 5-FU and UFT combination chemotherapy. After 2 cycles of the treatment, Virchow lymph node completely disappeared and the symptoms diminished. These combination therapies were effective for common bile duct cancer.","title":"[A case of common bile duct cancer responding to MMC leucovorin, 5-FU, and UFT combination chemotherapy and radiation].","pubmedId":"8645028"}
