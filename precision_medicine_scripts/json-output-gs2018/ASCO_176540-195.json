TSP1 binding CD36 evoked inflammation via the activation of TGF and STAT3. The aim of this study is to clarify the role of TSP1 in gastric carcinogenesis. Methods: Thirty-nine patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy were enrolled. The expression of TSP1 mRNA in non-cancer tissue was determined in clinicopathological factors (including mucosal inflammation and atrophy based on Sydney system). The expressions of CD36, STAT3 and TGFR2 mRNA in the TSP1 high and low expression group in non-cancer tissue were examined. Results: TSP1 expression was high in mucosal atrophy group and tended to be high in Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) (+) and multiple cancer group. In TSP1 high group, CD36, STAT3 and TGFR2 mRNA showed significantly high. The expressions of TSP1 signaling pathway in multiple cancer or atrophy (+) or H.pylori (+) showed high compared with that in single cancer and atrophy (-) and H.pylori (-). The expressions associated TSP1 signaling pathway in non-cancer tissue with multiple gastric cancer showed higher than that with single gastric cancer. Conclusions: Our results indicated TSP1 expressions in non-cancer tissue correlated with gastric carcinogenesis.","title":"Thrombospondin-1 expressions in non-cancer tissue correlated with gastric carcinogenesis.","pubmedId":"ASCO_176540-195"}
