Both tumor-targeting drug delivery and combination therapy of multiple therapeutic agents with distinct mechanisms are important for GBM treatment. We combined these two strategies and developed a new platform of peptide-drug conjugate (RGD-PEG-Suc-PD0325901, W22) for tumor-targeting delivery using a combination of PD0325901 (a MEK1/2 inhibitor) and RGD peptide. In the present study, the combination of PD0325901 and RGD peptide strongly inhibited U87MG model in vitro and in vivo. This inhibition contributed to synergistic suppression of cell proliferation by blocking ERK pathway activity and cell migration. Modified by conjugation strategy, their conjugate W22 enhanced PD0325901 delivery to GBM cells by receptor mediated cellular internalization. W22 showed great superiority in targeting to U87MG xenografted tumors and strong anti-tumor efficacy based on ERK pathway inhibition and tumor-targeted delivery in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, W22 was stable in serum and able to release PD0325901 in the enzymatic environment. These data indicated that the RGD-PEG-Suc-PD0325901 conjugate provided a strategy for effective delivery of PD0325901 and RGD peptide into the GBM cells and inhibition of tumor growth in a synergistic manner.
