A primary diagnosis of ALCL was made on FNA material in 2 cases, of which one was a multifocal osseous Ki-1 lymphoma. In the other 2 patients who had a known history of ALCL, FNA was used to detect recurrent disease. In all cases, large discohesive pleomorphic cells in the absence of lymphoglandular bodies in the background raised the possibility of a nonhematopoietic neoplasm. Immunochemical staining for CD30 was positive in all cases. The cytomorphologic and immunochemical features are discussed, along with the differential diagnosis of Ki-1 lymphoma. Diagn.
