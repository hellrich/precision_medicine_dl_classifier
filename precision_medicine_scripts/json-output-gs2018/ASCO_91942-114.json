This global study investigated the efficacy and safety of A compared with pemetrexed/cisplatin (PC) in pts with EGFR mutation positive advanced lung adenocarcinoma.  Methods: Following central testing for EGFR mutations (companion diagnostic TheraScreen EGFR RGQ PCR kit), 345 pts (stage IIIB/IV, PS 01, chemo-naive) were randomized 2:1 (A: 230; PC: 115) to daily A 40 mg or iv PC (500 mg/m2 + 75 mg/m2  q21 days up to 6 cycles). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by central independent review.  Results: Baseline characteristics were balanced in both arms: median age, 61 y; female, 65%; Asian, 72%; never-smoker, 68%; Del19, 49%; L858R, 40%; other mutations, 11%. Treatment with A led to a significantly prolonged PFS vs PC (median 11.1 vs 6.9 mos; HR 0.58 [0.430.78]; p\u003d0.0004). In 308 pts with common mutations (Del19/L858R), median PFS was 13.6 vs 6.9 mos, respectively (HR\u003d0.47 [0.340.65]; p\u003c0.0001). Objective response rate was significantly higher with A (56% vs 23%; p\u003c0.0001). Significant delay in time to deterioration of cancer-related symptoms of cough (HR\u003d0.60, p\u003d0.0072) and dyspnea (HR\u003d0.68, p\u003d0.0145) was seen with A vs PC. Most common drug-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (95%), rash (62%) and paronychia (57%) with A, and nausea (66%), decreased appetite (53%) and vomiting (42%) with PC. Drug-related AEs led to discontinuation in 8% (A; 1% due to diarrhea) and 12% of pts (PC).  Conclusions: LUX-Lung 3 is the largest prospective trial in EGFR mutation positive lung cancer and the first study using pemetrexed/cisplatin as a comparator. Treatment with afatinib significantly prolonged PFS compared to PC, with significant improvements in secondary endpoints. AEs with afatinib were manageable, with a low discontinuation rate. With 4.2 mos PFS improvement in the overall population and 6.7 mos in pts with common mutations, afatinib is a clinically relevant first-line treatment option.","title":"LUX-Lung 3: A randomized, open-label, phase III study of afatinib versus pemetrexed and cisplatin as first-line treatment for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung harboring EGFR-activating mutations.","pubmedId":"ASCO_91942-114"}
