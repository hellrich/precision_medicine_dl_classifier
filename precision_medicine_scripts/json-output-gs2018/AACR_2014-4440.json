Although TRAF4 was reported to be overexpressed in cancer tissues, the role of TRAF4 in tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we found TRAF4 is over expressed in lung cancer cell lines as well as lung cancer tissues. Knockdown TRAF4 dramatically attenuated lung cancer malignant phenotype including cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth and tumor development in a xenograft mouse model . To our surprised, it is that TRAF4, but not skp2 is required for Akt activation through ubiquitination in lung cancer. Overall, our study suggests that TRAF4 might be a potential molecular target for lung cancer prevention and therapy.","title":"TRAF4 is a key molecule for lung cancer through regulating AKT ubiquitination and activation","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4440"}
