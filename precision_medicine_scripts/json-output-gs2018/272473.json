Monoclonal gammaopathy, myeloma, myeloid metaplasia, and polycythemia have all been found in association with PG. Recently, seven cases of PG in association with leukemia have been described: three cases with acute myeloblastic leukemia, two cases with chronic myelogenous leukemia, one case with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and one case with acute leukemia of either plasma cell or myeloblast origin. To these we add two cases of PG with acute myeloblastic leukemia. These patients often have an atypical clinical presentation for PG, with bullae and relatively superficial involvement obscuring the correct diagnosis.","title":"Atypical pyoderma gangrenosum with leukemia.","pubmedId":"272473"}
