Herein specific examples are used to show how high-yield targets such as EGFR, 1p/19q, IDH1/2, MGMT, and BRAF can expand the power of the surgical neuropathologist. To avoid errors, however, the significance and controversies associated with each test must be thoroughly understood.","title":"How molecular testing can help (and hurt) in the workup of gliomas.","pubmedId":"23429363"}
