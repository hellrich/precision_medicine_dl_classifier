This study was to investigate the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of epithelioid sarcoma.\nThe clinical data of 14 patients with epithelioid sarcoma, admitted to our hospital from 1990 to 2005, were analyzed. All of the 14 patients received initial operations at other hospitals. Eleven patients received extensive excision (9 patients) or amputation (2 patients), and 4 of them also received local lymph node dissection at our hospital; 3 patients received another local excision or extensive excision at other hospitals again. Nine patients received adjuvant radiotherapy and 3 of them also received adjuvant chemotherapy.\nAll diagnoses of epithelioid sarcoma were confirmed by pathology. Of the 14 patients, 12 (85.7%) had local recurrence and 4 (28.6%) had local lymph node metastasis, 9 (64.3%) died within 3 years after initial operation. The overall 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-year survival rates were 71.43%, 55.56%, 27.78%, 13.89%, respectively.\nThe prognosis of epithelioid sarcoma is poor because of a high propensity for local recurrence, node metastases, and distant metastases. Extensive excision or radical excision combined local lymph node dissection is effective for epithelioid sarcoma.","title":"[Clinical analysis of 14 cases of epithelioid sarcoma].","pubmedId":"17626760"}
