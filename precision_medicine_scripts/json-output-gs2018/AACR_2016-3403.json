Angiogenesis has been considered an important role in the cancer metastasis. Therefore, a better understanding of angiogenic and metastatic pathways are needed. Amphiregulin (AR) has been implicated in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. However, the relationship of amphiregulin with vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression and angiogenesis in human chondrosarcoma cells is mostly unknown. In this study, we found that the expression of amphiregulin and VEGF-A were correlated with tumor stage and were significantly higher than that in the normal cartilage. VEGF-A expression increased which depend on time and dose dependent of amphiregulin. Exogenous amphiregulin with chondrosarcoma cells promoted VEGF-A expression and subsequently increased migration, proliferation and tube formation in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We also found that amphiregulin increased VEGF-A expression and angiogenesis through focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Knockdown of amphiregulin decreased VEGF-A expression in chondrosarcoma cells. The angiogenesis effects in Matrigel plug nude mice model in vivo was also abolished in amphiregulin-knockdown cells. Taken together, these results indicate that amphiregulin occurs through FAK, Src, and PKC pathway, resulting in the activation of VEGF-A expression and contributing to the angiogenesis of human chondrosarcoma cells.","title":"Amphiregulin promotes vascular endothelial growth factor-dependent angiogenesis in human chondrosarcoma cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3403"}
