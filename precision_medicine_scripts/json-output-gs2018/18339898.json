In leukemia, the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein inhibits SDF-1-dependent cell trafficking within the bone marrow through a mechanism that is not fully understood. Here, we report that BCR-ABL1 in malignant cells constitutively increases expression of activation-dependent epitopes of the beta(2) integrin LFA-1. This is associated with the complete loss of responsiveness of LFA-1 to SDF-1-induced \"inside-out\" signaling involving CXCR4 and Lyn, leading to aberrant adhesive responses. These data provide a novel, LFA-1-mediated mechanism whereby BCR-ABL1 inhibits SDF-1 action in malignant progenitors.","title":"BCR-ABL1 alters SDF-1alpha-mediated adhesive responses through the beta2 integrin LFA-1 in leukemia cells.","pubmedId":"18339898"}
