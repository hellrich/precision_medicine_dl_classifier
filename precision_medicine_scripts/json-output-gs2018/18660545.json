Humans and mice with mutated Ptc1 are prone to medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), both tumors showing dependence on radiation damage for rapid onset and high penetrance. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) is a nuclear enzyme that plays a multifunctional role in DNA damage signaling and repair. In healthy and fertile PARP-1-null mice, radiation exposure reveals an extreme sensitivity and a high genomic instability. To test for interactions between PARP-1 and sonic hedgehog signaling, PARP-1-null mice were crossed to Ptc1 heterozygous mice. PARP-1 deletion further accelerated medulloblastoma development in irradiated Ptc1(+/-) mice, showing that PARP-1 inactivation sensitizes cerebellar cells to radiation tumorigenic effects. In addition to increased formation and slowed down kinetics of disappearance of gamma-H2AX foci, we observed increased apoptosis in PARP-1-deficient granule cell progenitors after irradiation. Double-mutant mice were also strikingly more susceptible to BCC, with \u003e50% of animals developing multiple, large, infiltrative tumors within 30 weeks of age. The results provide genetic evidence that PARP-1 function suppresses sonic hedgehog pathway-associated tumors arising in response to environmental stress.","title":"PARP-1 cooperates with Ptc1 to suppress medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"18660545"}
