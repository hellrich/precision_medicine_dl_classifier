FOXP1-SHQ1 deletion significantly co-occurs with PTEN loss in prostate cancer and other cancers. We find that FOXP1-SHQ1 deletion cooperates with PTEN loss to accelerate prostate cancer development in mice, resulting in tumors with increased proliferation and highly anaplastic dedifferentiation. FOXP1-SHQ1 deletion in these PTEN null tumors results in selective mTORC1 pathway hyperactivation beyond that mediated by PTEN loss alone. FOXP1-SHQ1 deletion also partially rescues AR target gene inhibition caused by PTEN loss, circumventing the repression of the androgen axis seen upon PI3K pathway activation. Clinically, combined FOXP1 and PTEN loss is associated with increased prostate cancer recurrence, and this finding extends to other cancer types, most notably breast cancer.","title":"3p13-14 FOXP1-SHQ1 deletion spanning multiple potential tumor suppressor genes cooperates with PTEN loss in cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-1537"}
