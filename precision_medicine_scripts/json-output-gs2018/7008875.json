The nucleolar immunofluorescence was mainly observed in myeloblasts of myeloid leukemias an in immature as well as mature cells of the plasmacytic or lymphocytic cell lines of multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. With respect to the nucleolar immunofluorescence, both positive and negative populations of cells were noted in the specimens of all patients studied.","title":"Nucleolar immunofluorescence in bone marrow specimens of human hematological malignancies.","pubmedId":"7008875"}
