Currently erlotinib and gefitinib are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, whereas cetuximab is being studied for use in NSCLC. Erlotinib has shown a survival advantage in patients with advanced NSCLC. Further studies have identified female sex, nonsmokers, Asian race, good performance status, and adenocarcinoma histology as predictors of patient response to these agents. A genetic mutation in EGFR has also been correlated with an increase in response.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and their role in non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"15946581"}
