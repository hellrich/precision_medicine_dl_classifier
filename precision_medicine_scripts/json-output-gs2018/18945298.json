BRAF V600E appeared to be the most commonly mutated gene in both the melanocytic aggregate (seven of 18, 39%) and the melanoma (four of 18, 22%). Both populations demonstrated a similar BRAF genomic profile in 11 of 18 cases (61%) (two BRAF V600E, nine BRAF-WT), a similar KRAS genomic profile in 14 of 18 cases (78%) (one KRAS G12V, 13 KRAS-WT) and a similar NRAS2 genomic profile in 14 of 18 cases (all WT). Of interest, we noted a relatively high prevalence of KRAS mutations (five of 18, 28%). The frequency of KRAS mutations in the melanocytic aggregate (five of 18, 28%) was second to BRAF V600E, while in melanoma, the frequency was also second to BRAF V600E but equalled that of NRAS2 (1 of 18, 6%). No NRAS1 mutations were observed. BRAF and RAS mutations appeared to be mutually exclusive with only three of 18 cases (17%) demonstrating a mutation in both genes (melanocytic aggregate only).\nOur findings hint towards the interpretation of banal melanocytic aggregates serving as precursor lesions.","title":"RAS and RAF mutations in banal melanocytic aggregates contiguous with primary cutaneous melanoma: clues to melanomagenesis.","pubmedId":"18945298"}
