Expression of defective DNA repair genes was not detected in DNA repair-deficient human cell lines, whereas the intact genes were detected in repair-proficient cell lines and in lymphocytes from a normal donor. The assay was reproducible, and repeated determinations of the same samples generated highly consistent results for each target gene. This approach should facilitate molecular epidemiological studies that incorporate screening for germline alterations that may affect gene expression and for changes in the levels of gene expression.","title":"Simultaneous amplification of four DNA repair genes and beta-actin in human lymphocytes by multiplex reverse transcriptase-PCR.","pubmedId":"7585546"}
