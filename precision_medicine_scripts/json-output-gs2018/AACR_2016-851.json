Mosaic germline mutations such as those affecting RB1, TP53 and AKT1 are important for clinical testing. However, it is challenging to detect mosaic mutation by genome-wide sequencing approaches as a mutant allele present at a low fraction in a germline sample can be caused by either tumor-in-normal contamination or mosaicism. Here we propose a two-step analytical approach to distinguish between these two possibilities. The first involves assessing the level of tumor-in-normal contamination using all clonal somatic mutations identified through the analysis of tumor purity and chromosome ploidy. The second step determines the probability of mosaicism for a candidate variant by calculating the binomial probability of its mutant allele fraction (MAF) under the contamination hypothesis. We applied this process to 1,172 paired tumor-normal pediatric cancer samples analyzed by whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing. Six mosaic variants were identified, including three pathogenic TP53 mutations with a mutant allele fractions (MAF) ranging from 0.2 to 0.3, one RB1 mutation in a retinoblastoma case with a MAF of 0.08, one IDH1 p.R132H mutation in an acute myeloid leukemia case with a MAF of 0.21, and one mosaic RYR2 p.E1690D mutation in an osteosarcoma case with a MAF of 0.11. At the same time, we were able to reject three candidate TP53 variants caused by contamination with MAFs ranging from 0.06 to 0.33. All predicted mosaic mutations were verified by ultra deep sequencing at 10,000X coverage. This experience demonstrates the feasibility of detecting germline mosaicism from whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing of paired tumor-normal samples and would caution accurate analysis of tumor-in-normal contamination when evaluating candidate germline mosaicism.","title":"Analysis of cancer-initiating mosaic mutation in germline samples of pediatric cancer patients by next generation sequencing","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-851"}
