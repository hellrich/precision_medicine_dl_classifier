In astrocytomas, although CDKN2A (p16(INK4A) protein) is often inactivated, there are still some controversial issues regarding the mechanism by which this alteration occurs. Thus, we analyzed a series of astrocytomas to assess the association between CDKN2A expression and methylation of grade I-IV tumors (WHO) and clinicopathological parameters. DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material of 93 astrocytic tumors was available for CDKN2A promoter methylation analysis and p16(INK4A) expression by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. A strong negative correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining and CDKN2A promoter methylation was found. Additionally, a significant negative correlation between CDKN2A promoter methylation and age was observed; also, female patients had statistically more CDKN2A methylated promoters (p \u003d 0.036) than men. In conclusion, CDKN2A inactivation by promoter methylation is a frequent event in astrocytomas and it is related to the age and sex of patients.
