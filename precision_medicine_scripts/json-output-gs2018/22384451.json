With the finding that approximately 50% of melanomas harbor an activating mutation in the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf gene (BRAF), inhibition of mutated B-raf represented an attractive and innovative focus for the development of novel targeted therapy potentially benefiting a large proportion of melanoma patients. Impressive response rates with an overall survival benefit in addition to minimal treatment-related toxicity in phase I-III clinical studies led to the FDA\u0027s approval of vemurafenib for patients with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic BRAFV600E-mutated malignant melanoma in August 2011. While the majority of patients with BRAF-mutated disease show favorable treatment responses shortly after initiation of vemurafenib therapy, the median progression-free survival is 6 months, making the search for resistance mechanisms a high priority. While vemurafenib represents an excellent model for successful targeted anticancer therapy, long-term safety data are needed and rational combination with other agents will be critical to prevent or circumvent the development of resistance.","title":"Vemurafenib: the road to personalized medicine in melanoma.","pubmedId":"22384451"}
