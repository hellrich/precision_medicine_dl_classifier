This is particularly true for the understudied dark matter of the melanoma genome, i.e. cases that lack mutations in the three most commonly-mutated melanoma genes (BRAF, NRAS, NF1) and that display extensive mutational heterogeneity. Clearly a pressing need exists for transformative approaches to melanoma medicine. We have therefore broadened our traditional focus on melanoma in human patients to include canine melanoma as a model of human disease. Given canine melanoma\u0027s clinicopathological resemblance to human non-cutaneous triple-negative subtypes, study of this disease in each species may inform the other. Further, the accelerated clinical course of canine melanoma and flexibility in veterinary clinical trial design may allow for evaluation of novel treatment designs that would not be possible in human cancer trials. Thus, we have undertaken a first-in-dog genomic characterization study of canine melanomas from a cohort of 37 dogs to further explore the landscape of this comparative model. This analysis combines comprehensive genomics (whole genome, whole genome long-insert, RNA sequencing, and array comparative genomic hybridization) in 7 matched canine melanoma/normal tissues with targeted analysis in an additional 27 tumors and 3 cell lines. These canine tumors display striking patterns of mutation and subtype heterogeneity resembling that of their non-cutaneous human counterparts with the majority being BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 wild type and lacking recurrent single nucleotide variants. Despite heterogeneity at the single nucleotide level, shared patterns of structural variation and gene expression exist and these patterns suggest core pathways that may define therapeutic vulnerabilities in these disease subtypes. These data provide the genomic framework for further clinical pursuit of melanoma in the canine model as a paradigm for drug development.","title":"The genomic landscape of canine melanoma reveals broad mutational heterogeneity and recurrent patterns of structural variation","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3417"}
