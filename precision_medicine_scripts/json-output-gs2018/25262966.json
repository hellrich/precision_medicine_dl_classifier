Recent studies have indicated that HO-1 activation may play a role in tumour development and progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of HO-1 in thyroid cancer and its clinicopathological significance.\nWe observed up-regulation of HO-1 in papillary thyroid tumours in comparison with normal thyroid tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 48% of papillary cancers and 36% of follicular cancers, but none of normal thyroid tissues, were positive for HO-1 expression. Among 129 differentiated thyroid cancers, HO-1 expression was associated with patient age (P \u003d 0.001), TNM stage (P \u003d 0.001), and Mayo Clinic metastasis, patient age, completeness of resection, local invasion and tumour size score (P \u003d 0.001). BRAF V600E expression was evaluated immunohistochemically and validated by Sanger sequencing. There was a strong association between HO-1 and BRAF V600E expression in papillary cancers (P \u003d 0.002).\nOverexpression of HO-1 in a subset of thyroid cancers is associated with tumour aggressiveness and BRAF V600E expression. HO-1 might have a potential role in prognosis and targeted treatment in patients with thyroid cancer.","title":"Expression of haem oxygenase-1 correlates with tumour aggressiveness and BRAF V600E expression in thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"25262966"}
