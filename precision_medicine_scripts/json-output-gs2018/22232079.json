Study reports describing incidences of SMN and malignant melanoma as SMN in a population of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) were included. Of 151,575 CCS, 4,010 (2.6%) children developed an SMN, 212 of which were melanoma (5.3% or 0.14% of all CCS). The following risk factors for malignant melanoma as SMN were identified: radiotherapy, or the combination alkylating agents and anti-mitotic drugs. Melanomas are most frequently observed after Hodgkin disease, hereditary retinoblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and gonadal tumors.","title":"Malignant melanoma as second malignant neoplasm in long-term childhood cancer survivors: a systematic review.","pubmedId":"22232079"}
