In the present study, we investigated whether VEGF affects the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of human monocytes mediated by trastuzumab.\nHER-2-expressing tumor cell lines (MKN-7, TE-4 and SKOV-3) were evaluated for trastuzumab-mediated ADCC of human monocytes in the presence of VEGF(165). The trastuzumab-mediated, monocyte-derived ADCC were treated with the anti-human blocking VEGF R1 or VEGF R2 mAb. VEGF-induced intracellular signaling on monocytes was quantified with ELISA kits.\nVEGF partially inhibited the ADCC of human monocytes mediated by trastuzumab. The VEGF-induced deficiency of human monocytes for ADCC was completely recovered by the anti-human blocking VEGF R1 mAb, while the anti-VEGF R2 blocking mAb did not have any effect. Furthermore, VEGF treatment enhanced the phospho-Erk 1/2 in human monocytes.\nVEGF partially inhibited the ADCC of human monocytes mediated by trastuzumab, and this inhibition was mainly mediated by VEGF R1 (Flt-1).","title":"Vascular endothelial growth factor partially inhibits the trastuzumab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of human monocytes.","pubmedId":"18097168"}
