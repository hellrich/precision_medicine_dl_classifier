Recent studies have found deletions or translocations of chromosome 7q to be the most common cytogenetic abnormality observed in SLVL, a leukemic variant of SMZL, with the q21-q22 region being most frequently affected. In three patients with translocations between chromosomes 2 and 7, the cloning of the breakpoints at 7q21 revealed that each was located within a small region of DNA 3.6 kb upstream of the transcription start site of cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). In each case the translocation event was consistent with aberrant VJ recombination between the immunoglobulin light chain region (Ig kappa) on chromosome 2p12 and DNA sequences at 7q21, resembling the heptamer recombination site. The t(7;21) breakpoint in an additional patient with splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), resided 66 kb telomeric to the t(2;7) breakpoints juxtaposing CDK6 to an uncharacterized transcript. In two of the SLVL patient samples, the CDK6 protein was found to be markedly over expressed. These results suggest that dysregulation of CDK6 gene expression contributes to the pathogenesis of SLVL and SMZL.","title":"Dysregulation of cyclin dependent kinase 6 expression in splenic marginal zone lymphoma through chromosome 7q translocations.","pubmedId":"10597225"}
