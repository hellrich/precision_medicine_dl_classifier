Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to assess chromosomal copy number alterations in both components.\nSixteen CCTs were included. The most common subtype was the squamomelanocytic tumor (11), followed by the basomelanocytic tumor (3) and the trichoblastomelanoma (2). CCTs were more common in men (87%), on the head and neck (57%), and had extensive solar elastosis (81%). The median follow-up was 25 months (range, 8-167 months). One case had an adverse outcome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed chromosomal alterations in approximately 55% of the cases. Five cases showed chromosomal gains only in the melanocytic component. One case showed 11q13 gains in both the epithelial and melanocytic components.\nOur study is retrospective and the sample is small.\nThe low incidence of adverse outcomes suggests that CCT may be more indolent than noncombined tumors. 11q13 amplification in both components supports the theory of dual differentiation from a common progenitor cell.","title":"Combined cutaneous tumors with a melanoma component: A clinical, histologic, and molecular study.","pubmedId":"26209219"}
