After a transchoroïdal biopsy, the pathologic examination disclosed a choroïdal melanoma of epithelioid cell type, using morphological criteria as well as an immunohistochemical study. After treatment with a ruthenium plaque, the tumor completely regressed over 4 months. According to the data of the literature, neurofibromatosis seems to predispose to the development of uveal melanomas.","title":"[Malignant melanoma of the choroid associated with neurofibromatosis].","pubmedId":"8496569"}
