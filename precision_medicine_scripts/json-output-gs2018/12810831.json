The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship of p53, nm23, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and c-erbB-2 with the clinicopathological parameters and the survival results.\nFor 841 patients who had undergone gastrectomy for gastric cancer at Seoul National University Hospital from July 1996 to December 1997, the expression levels of p53, nm23, PCNA and c-erbB-2 in gastric cancer tissues were examined immunohistochemically. Also, the clinicopathological parameters such as gender, age, operation type, TNM stage and size of the tumor, histology and Lauren classification were analyzed retrospectively.\nThere were 568 males and 273 females (2.07:1) with a mean age of 56 years (range:25-82 years). The percentages of positive expression of p53, nm23 and c-erbB-2 were 43, 74 and 17%, respectively; 59% of tumors expressed PCNA index \u003e or \u003d50. p53 expression was associated with age, gender, tumor size, histology, Lauren classification, stage, nm23 expression, PCNA index \u003eor \u003d50 and c-erbB-2 expression. nm23 expression was associated with age, tumor size, Borrmann type, histology, Lauren classification and stage. PCNA index \u003e or \u003d50 was associated with age, gender, tumor size, Borrmann type, histology, Lauren classification and c-erbB-2 expression. c-erbB-2 expression was associated with gender, Borrmann type, histology and Lauren classification. p53 and nm23 were related with poor prognosis in univariate analysis. nm23 was related with poor prognosis of stage III and diffuse-type gastric cancer in univariate subgroup analysis. However, in a multivariate study, these prognostic impacts were not maintained.\nThe expression of p53 and nm23 seems to be related with poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients who have undergone gastrectomy. However, the prognostic significance was not revealed by a multivariate analysis.","title":"Prognostic significance of p53, nm23, PCNA and c-erbB-2 in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"12810831"}
