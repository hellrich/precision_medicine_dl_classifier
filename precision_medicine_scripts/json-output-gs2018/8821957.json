All cases of well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma showed positivity for ICAM-1, whereas the follicular carcinomas, follicular adenomas, and all but one nodular goiters were negative. It is suggested that the occurrence of ICAM-1 on the thyroid cell surfaces in well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinomas may contribute to the understanding of their biology and could be of potential significance for diagnostic purposes.","title":"Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) immunoreactivity in well-differentiated thyroid papillary carcinomas.","pubmedId":"8821957"}
