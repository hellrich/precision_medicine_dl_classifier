They were found to predict worse overall survival (OS) of mutated patients.\nRT-PCR followed by direct sequencing was used to test the presence of DNMT3A mutations in 226 AML patients with an intermediate-risk (IR) cytogenetics.\nSixty-seven patients of 226 (29.6%) carried a mutation in the DNMT3A gene. Occurrence of DNMT3A mutations was associated with female sex (P \u003d 0.027) and with the presence of FLT3/ITD (P \u003d 0.003), but not with particular FAB subtypes. Patients with DNMT3A mutation had higher initial WBC counts than those without it (P \u003d 0.064) only because of higher incidence of FLT3/ITD within these cases. There was no difference between mutated and wild-type groups in reaching complete remission (CR) (P \u003d 0.380). OS was not affected by DNMT3A mutation (P \u003d 0.251), but OS of patients who reached CR was longer in DNMT3A negative cases (P \u003d 0.025). Patients with DNMT3A mutation had a higher relapse rate (P \u003d 0.007). Patients carrying both the DNMT3A mutation and FLT3/ITD relapsed more often than either patients with single DNMT3A mutation (P \u003d 0.044) or patients with FLT3/ITD only (P \u003d 0.058). DNMT3A mutations were associated with higher relapse rate even within the FLT3/ITD-negative group (P \u003d 0.072). After reaching CR, these two genetic factors were independent predictors of relapse at multivariate analysis (P \u003c 0.001). Only three of 30 \u0027double-mutated\u0027 (FLT3/ITD+, DNMT3A+) patients are still alive, all of them having undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\nWe have confirmed the high incidence of DNMT3A mutations in patients with AML with IR cytogenetics. Patients with DNMT3A mutations relapse more often and have inferior OS when only patients achieving CR are analyzed. \u0027Double-mutated\u0027 patients have a very poor prognosis.","title":"Prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations in patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk profile acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"21967546"}
