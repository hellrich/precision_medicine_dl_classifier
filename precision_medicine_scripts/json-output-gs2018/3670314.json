Two fully differentiated, hormone-responsive cell lines from rat thyroid glands are presented which are susceptible to one-step or two-step transformation upon infection with several murine acute retroviruses. After infection, both cell lines became independent from their thyrotropic hormone requirement for growth. However, complete transformation was achieved with one of the cell lines (FRTL-5 Cl 2), whereas the other cell line (PC Cl 3) failed to grow in agar and to give rise to tumors in vivo. The latter cell line was susceptible to complete transformation upon cooperation of the v-ras-Ha and the human c-myc oncogenes.","title":"One- and two-step transformations of rat thyroid epithelial cells by retroviral oncogenes.","pubmedId":"3670314"}
