The aim of this study was to determine the spectrum of genomic alterations identified in MBC patients, and evaluate the concordance of alterations between primary and recurrent tumors.  Methods:  We performed comprehensive profiling on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples from 42 patients with MBC using a targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) assay in a CLIA laboratory (Foundation Medicine). Genomic libraries were captured for 3,230 exons in 182 cancer related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes often rearranged in cancer and sequenced to an average depth of 390X with 99% of bases covered \u003e100X. In total 30 primary and 37 recurrent tumors were profiled, including 3 separate recurrences in 1 patient and matched primary-recurrences in 22 patients. Point mutations, indels, copy number alterations and rearrangements were assessed. Alterations that are targetable with established or investigational therapeutics were considered actionable.  Results:  At least 1 genomic alteration was identified in all but 2 breast samples (both primary tumors).  Point mutations were identified in several cancer-related genes including PIK3CA, TP53, PTEN, CDH1, ARID1A, AKT1, NF1, FBXW7 and FGFR3. Amplification was observed in HER2; 11 of 12 HER2 IHC positive samples were found to have HER2 gains by NGS; in addition, a HER2 gain was identified by NGS in a HER2- (1+ IHC) sample. Amplification of PIK3CA, IGF1R, FGFR2, AKT2, MDM2, and MCL1 plus a CDKN2A homozygous deletion were also identified. While the majority of known driver alterations (85%) were concordant in the matched pairs of primary and recurrent tumors, in 11 of 22 sets there was at least 1 discordant driver alteration, and these included both gains and losses of potential therapeutic targets. Overall 32 of 42 patients (76%) had an actionable genomic alteration.  Conclusions:  Genomic profiling of breast cancer samples reveals genomic alterations in most metastatic breast cancer patients. Over three quarters of patients have actionable findings, suggesting that genomic profiling may assist in individualized pathway-directed therapy.","title":"Cancer gene profile of metastatic breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_101210-114"}
