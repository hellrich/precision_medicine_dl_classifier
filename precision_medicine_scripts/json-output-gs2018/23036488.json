Combined treatment with selective class I PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 and sorafenib reversed the protective effects of bone marrow stromal cells on FLT3-mutant AML cells in hypoxia, which was associated with downregulation of Pim-1 and Mcl-1 expression levels. These findings suggest that combined inhibition of PI3K and FLT3-ITD may constitute a targeted approach to eradicating chemoresistant AML cells sequestered in hypoxic bone marrow niches.","title":"Mechanisms of apoptosis induction by simultaneous inhibition of PI3K and FLT3-ITD in AML cells in the hypoxic bone marrow microenvironment.","pubmedId":"23036488"}
