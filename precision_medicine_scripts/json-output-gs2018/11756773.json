In this study the immunostaining profile of HMB45-negative malignant melanomas was evaluated by a panel of antibodies against markers associated with melanoma and melanocytic differentiation, including microphthalmia transcription factor, tyrosinase, Melan-A, and MAGE-1. Immunodetection was performed on paraffin sections of 22 cases of HMB45-negative malignant melanomas (including 8 spindle cell melanomas, 8 desmoplastic melanomas, and 6 epithelioid melanomas), 8 HMB45-and S-100-positive malignant melanomas, 15 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 16 schwannomas, and 11 neurofibromas. Of eight HMB45-positive malignant melanomas, all were positive for Melan-A, tyrosinase, and melanocyte-specific transcription factor, and three were positive for MAGE-1. In the 14 HMB-45 negative, nondesmoplastic melanomas, melanocyte-specific transcription factor was positive in 9, Melan-A in 9, tyrosinase in 6, and MAGE-1 in 11. In eight desmoplastic malignant melanomas, MAGE-1 was positive in three, and all other markers were negative. The five markers tested were negative in all but two schwannomas, one with focal melanocyte-specific transcription factor and the other with tyrosinase and weak MAGE-1 reactivity. MAGE-1, melanocyte-specific transcription factor, tyrosinase, and Melan-A are useful markers in the diagnosis of malignant melanocytic lesions when HMB45 is negative. MAGE-1 may be useful in differentiating melanocytic lesions from nerve-derived lesions, but its sensitivity is relatively low. The immunostaining profile of desmoplastic malignant melanomas more closely resembles that of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor than that of other types of malignant melanoma. Melanocyte-specific transcription factor is not a useful marker for desmoplastic melanoma.","title":"Immunoprofile of MITF, tyrosinase, melan-A, and MAGE-1 in HMB45-negative melanomas.","pubmedId":"11756773"}
