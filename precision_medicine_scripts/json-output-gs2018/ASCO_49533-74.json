ACC has a propensity for perineural invasion and local and distant recurrence. Traditional chemotherapeutic agents, like D, have limited activity in ACC, and are usually reserved for symptomatic metastasis. There is an unmet need for active regimens in ACC. B is a highly selective inhibitor of the 26S proteasome which is central for the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. Inhibition of NF-B activity achieved by B may be important for inhibition of the growth of ACC. A previous trial (E1303) evaluated single-agent B in advanced, incurable ACC and reported high rate of disease stabilization but no objective responses (Argiris et al. ASCO 2006;A5573). However, a partial response was seen in a patient who received D added to B at the time of progression. There is strong preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting increased antitumor efficacy with the addition of anthracyclines to B. Methods: Eligible patients have incurable, previously untreated ACC of the head and neck with measurable disease by RECIST, ECOG performance status 0-2, ejection fraction within normal limits, and adequate laboratory parameters. Treatment consists of B 1.3 mg/m2, intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, and D 20 mg/m2, IV on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dextrazoxane is added at the 8th cycle and all subsequent cycles with D. After 14 cycles, if there is no progression, B is given alone once a week at a dose of 1.6 mg/m2 on days 1,8,15, every 28 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the objective response rate and the stable disease rate. Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. The study follows a two-stage design. Initially, 11 patients will be accrued. If there are 2 or more responses or 5 or more stable disease the study will continue to the second phase accruing additional 21 patients (total of 32 patients). Baseline tumor tissue and blood will be collected for the study of biomarkers including NF-kB, p53, p27, p21, cyclin D1, cyclin E, VEGF, microvessel density, V-CAM, ICAM-1 and N-CAM. 8 patients have been accrued in this study.","title":"Phase II trial of doxorubicin (D) and bortezomib (B) in patients with incurable adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"ASCO_49533-74"}
