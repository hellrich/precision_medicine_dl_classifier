{"keywords":["Distal cholangiocarcinoma","Meta-analysis","Prognostic factors"],"publicationTypes":["Review","Journal Article"],"abstract":"To assess the available evidence on the prognostic factors for the 5-year survival for patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma (DCC) following surgical resection.\nWe performed a comprehensive search of abstracts included in databases where relevant studies were published between January 2000 and August 2015. Risk ratios (RRs), 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs), and random-effects model were calculated using RevMan 5.3 software.\nA total of 23 observational studies involving 2063 patients with DCC were analyzed. The meta-analysis showed that postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was not confirmed as a prognostic factor, with similar 5-year survival rates between those receiving and not receiving chemotherapy (RR 0.71; 95 % CI 0.21-2.36; P \u003d 0.57). Perineural invasion (RR 0.51; 95 % CI 0.40-0.64; P \u003c 0.00001), lymph node metastasis (RR 0.51; 95 % CI 0.38-0.70; P \u003c 0.0001), positive resection margin status (RR 2.11; 95 % CI 1.36-3.30; P \u003d 0.001), and not-well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (RR 1.77; 95 % CI 1.39-2.25; P \u003c 0.00001) were associated with shorter survival.\nPerineural invasion, lymph node metastasis, resection margin status, and tumor differentiation were the significant prognostic factors for the 5-year survival.","title":"The survival outcome and prognostic factors for distal cholangiocarcinoma following surgical resection: a meta-analysis for the 5-year survival.","pubmedId":"27236779"}
