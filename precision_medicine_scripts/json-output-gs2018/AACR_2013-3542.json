We assessed progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity and their relationships to these SNPs.RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were evaluable. Among candidate SNPs, rs2010963, rs833068, and rs1870377 were associated with poor PFS (P \u003d .009, .002, and .029, respectively), while rs1870377 and rs7692791 were associated with poor OS (P \u003d .001 and 0.03, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that only rs1870377 had significant effects on both PFS and OS. Toxicity evaluation indicated that rs1531289 was associated with grade 3-4 anemia. (P \u003d .03).CONCLUSIONS: Certain SNPs of KDR may affect treatment outcome and toxicity of patients treated with sunitinib.","title":"Effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms on treatment outcomes and toxicity in patients treated with sunitinib for biliary tract and gastric cancers.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-3542"}
