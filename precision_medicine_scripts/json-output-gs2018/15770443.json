Initially, patients are often evaluated for malignancy or other infections such as tuberculosis. In the past, surgery was the only management option for C. immitis infection of the male reproductive tract, but azole therapy now provides an adjunct or an alternative. We describe two patients who received azole therapy for C. immitis infection of the male reproductive tract. One received fluconazole for prostatic disease, while one received surgery followed by itraconazole for testicular disease. After 12 months of therapy, both remain asymptomatic and have decreased antibody titers against C. immitis.","title":"Coccidioidomycosis of the male reproductive tract.","pubmedId":"15770443"}
