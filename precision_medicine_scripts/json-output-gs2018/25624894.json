In the present study, a case of primary tracheal malignant melanoma, a particularly rare type of cancer, is reported. A 68-year-old male presented with a cough and bloody sputum. A chest computed tomography scan revealed a 25×20×15-mm tracheal tumor, located immediately above the carina, which reduced the cross-sectional area of the trachea by ~90%. Histopathological analysis of biopsy specimens determined a diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The patient was treated with argon plasma coagulation and chemoradiotherapy, which restored airway patency, however, metastasis was detected in the lungs. The patient refused further treatment and received palliative care. Subsequently, the patient succumbed to the disease within four months. Thus, although primary malignant melanoma of the trachea is extremeley rare, the possibility should be considered during diagnosis.","title":"Primary malignant melanoma of the trachea: A case report.","pubmedId":"25624894"}
