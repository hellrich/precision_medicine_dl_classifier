Pathologically analyzed thyroid carcinomas were obtained from 640 patients (20-40 years old at the time of surgery and born before the Chernobyl accident), and from 90 patients (11-22 years old at the time of surgery and born after the accident). All patients were operated during 2006-2008. RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF(V600E) mutation were analyzed in 35 cases of PTC.\nA comparison between the thyroid cancer incidence rates in the 6 highest contaminated regions of Ukraine and in the other 21 regions shows the most significant difference between the rates for the last three years of follow-up, which confirms that a direct relationship is still present between the rise in thyroid cancer incidence and the post Chernobyl radiation exposure. Much lower incidence of thyroid cancer in subjects, who were born after the accident, additionally confirmed a direct relationship between the Chernobyl accident and thyroid cancer development at least in those who were aged up to 18 years at the time of the nuclear accident. Pathological results showed that with increasing latency the decrease has been noted in the percentage of PTC with solid structure, a decrease in invasive properties of tumors, as well as an increase in the percentage of PTC with papillary-follicular structure, encapsulated forms, and \u003c\u003csmall\u003e\u003e carcinomas measuring up to 1 cm. Molecular-biological studies of PTC revealed more common RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 rearrangements (34.3% of cases), than BRAFV600E mutation (24%cases).\nAfter 22 years from the Chernobyl nuclear accident the number and incidence of thyroid cancer cases in Ukraine was steadily increased in the cohort of those who were children and adolescents at the time of the accident. Most common thyroid tumors (PTC) were characterized by significant changes in histological structure with increasing latency. PTC with any RET/PTC rearrangements had more aggressive behavior than BRAF(V600E)-positive tumors or PTC without gene alterations.","title":"Radiation induced thyroid cancer: fundamental and applied aspects.","pubmedId":"21403618"}
