Genome DNAs were extracted from the patient\u0027s blood and small-intestinal cancer and were subjected to a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis for exons of the p53 and PTEN/MMAC1 genes to search for any mutations. The sequence analysis revealed a point mutation of the p53 codon 93 in the cancer DNA; however, no mutation of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene was observed in either the blood or cancer DNA. The p53 mutation, therefore, seems to be related to tumour progression of small-intestinal cancer; however, no relationship was found between the PTEN/MMAC1 gene and the small-intestinal cancer.","title":"p53 and PTEN/MMAC1 mutational analysis of the small-intestinal cancer.","pubmedId":"12846407"}
