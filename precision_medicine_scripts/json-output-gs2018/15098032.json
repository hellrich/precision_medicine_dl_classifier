Here, we show that Bcr-Abl activated the Src kinases Lyn, Hck and Fgr in B-lymphoid cells. BCR-ABL1 retrovirus-transduced marrow from mice lacking all three Src kinases efficiently induced CML but not B-ALL in recipients. The kinase inhibitor CGP76030 impaired the proliferation of B-lymphoid cells expressing Bcr-Abl in vitro and prolonged survival of mice with B-ALL but not CML. The combination of CGP76030 and imatinib was superior to imatinib alone in this regard. The biochemical target of CGP76030 in leukemia cells was Src kinases, not Bcr-Abl. These results implicate Src family kinases as therapeutic targets in Ph(+) B-ALL and suggest that simultaneous inhibition of Src and Bcr-Abl kinases may benefit individuals with Ph(+) acute leukemia.","title":"Requirement of Src kinases Lyn, Hck and Fgr for BCR-ABL1-induced B-lymphoblastic leukemia but not chronic myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"15098032"}
