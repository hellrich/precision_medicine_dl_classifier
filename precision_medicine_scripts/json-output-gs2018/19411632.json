We investigated whether Survivin mediates the enhanced survival of primary hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) resulting from ITD-Flt3 signaling. Ectopic ITD-Flt3 mutants increased Survivin expression in Ba/F3 cells downstream of PI3-kinase/Akt. Treatment of ITD-Flt3(+) human MV4-11 leukemia cells with the ITD-Flt3 inhibitor SU5416 reduced Survivin expression and inhibited cell proliferation. ITD-Flt3 dramatically increased the number of primary mouse marrow c-kit(+), Sca-1(+), Lin(Neg) cells and colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophages (CFU-GMs) able to proliferate in the absence of growth factors, whereas Survivin deletion significantly reduced growth factor-independent proliferation and increased apoptosis, which was further accentuated by SU5416. Ectopic ITD-Flt3 reduced differentiation of Lin(Neg) marrow cells cultured with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plus stem cell factor, which was partially blocked by Survivin deletion. In addition, Survivin deletion decreased secondary colony formation induced by ITD-Flt3. Dominant-negative (dn)-Survivin delayed development of acute leukemia in mice that received a transplant of Ba/F3 cells expressing ITD-Flt3. These results suggest that Survivin regulates expansion of ITD-Flt3-transformed HPCs with self-renewal capability and development of ITD-Flt3(+) acute leukemia and that antagonizing Survivin may provide therapeutic benefit for patients with acute leukemia expressing ITD-Flt3.","title":"Survivin mediates aberrant hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and acute leukemia in mice induced by internal tandem duplication of Flt3.","pubmedId":"19411632"}
