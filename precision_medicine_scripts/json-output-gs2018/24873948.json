Four patients with BRAF V600 mutation underwent surgery to remove all thyroid tissue, two patients received a lobectomy and one patient is awaiting thyroidectomy. All patients with BRAF V600 mutation were found to have malignancy on final histology, with a diagnostic sensitivity for malignancy excluding coincidental microcarcinoma of 43% and specificity of 100%.\nBRAF V600 mutational analysis can enable single-stage total thyroidectomy for carcinoma if gene mutation is present in preoperative FNA. BRAF V600 co-testing may reduce the need for completion thyroidectomy with implied cost savings and lower patient morbidity associated with completion thyroidectomy when the cytology is inconclusive but where BRAF V600 mutation is identified in preoperative thyroid FNA.","title":"BRAF V600 co-testing in thyroid FNA cytology: short-term experience in a large cancer centre in the UK.","pubmedId":"24873948"}
