The diagnosis of MTC was based on the presence of a thyroid nodule or involved neck lymph nodes and on dysmorphic features of MEN 2B in 60% and 40% of the cases, respectively. The classic M918T mutation in exon 16 was found in the 16 patients in whom it was investigated. At diagnosis, 2 patients had Stage I MTC, 15 patients had Stage III, and 1 patient had Stage IV disease. T1 MTC was found in 4 patients aged 2.1-3.7 years. However, two of these patients already had N1 disease. One patient with Stage I MTC, aged 3.4 years and 2 patients with Stage III disease, aged 14 and 25 years, had undetectable basal calcitonin (CT) after initial surgery. During follow-up, basal CT became detectable in one of three patients. Among the 15 other patients with an elevated postoperative CT level, metastases were demonstrated in 5 patients after a mean follow-up of 2 years. Five patients died, three of MTC, one of the MEN 2B syndrome, and one of intercurrent disease. Five- and 10-year overall survival rates were 85% and 75%, respectively.\nThis study confirms the need for early treatment of MTC in patients with the MEN 2B syndrome, preferably within the first 6 months of life. The phenotype of MTC occurring in the MEN 2B syndrome was not more aggressive than sporadic MTC or MTC occurring in other familial syndromes.","title":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma as part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B syndrome: influence of the stage on the clinical course.","pubmedId":"11815959"}
