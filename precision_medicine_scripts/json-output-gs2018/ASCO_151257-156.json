However, robust  prognostic or predictive biomarkers are needed in this setting. TP53 is mutated in 23% of breast cancers, although this frequency varies widely among different histologies. HER-2 amplified and basal-like tumors show the higher rates of mutation: 37% and 45%, respectively. We tested whether TP53 mutations influence disease free-survival (DFS) in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).  Methods:  We assessed TP53 status in pretreatment paraffin-embedded tumor samples from a cohort of 79 breast cancer patients (p) treated homogenously with NACT. Of these, 26 were HER2+ and 53 HER2 negative. TP53 mutations were classified as disruptive (D) and non disruptive (ND) according to the degree of disturbance of p53 protein function and structure.  Results:  Mutations in exons 5-8 of TP53 were detected in 16 patients (20%). Of those, 6 harbored disruptive and 10 non-disruptive mutations. As previously reported, TP53 mutations were more common in non-luminal subgroups. After 40 months of follow-up, no recurrences had occurred among TP53 D patients (0%), compared with 7 in the TP53 WT group (11.1%) and 5 in TP53 ND (50%). No deaths were registered in TP53 D group, compared with 4 (6.3%) in TP53 WT and 2 (20%) in TP53 ND. Median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with ND mutations was 24.5 months (CI 95% 15.2-41.7) while it was not reached in patients TP53-wt or carrying D mutations (P \u003c 0.0001 in a Log Rank test). The association of ND mutations with shorter PFS was maintained when patients were divided according to HER2 status.  Conclusions:  Non-disruptive mutations in the TP53 gene areassociated with shorter PFS in resected breast cancer treated treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Further studies are warranted to determine whether TP53 ND mutations can be a prognostic marker of poor outcome in this setting.","title":"Association of non-disruptive P53 mutations with poor progression-free survival (PFS) in resected breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_151257-156"}
