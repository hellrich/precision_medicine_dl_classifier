The intervals from diagnosis to BM harvest were median 159 (range 78-463) and from preceding chemotherapy to BM harvest median 39 (range 26-69) days, respectively. A limiting log(10)-dilution RT-PCR was used to semiquantify BCR-ABL-positive cells. All autografts appeared to be significantly contaminated with residual leukemic cells. The BCR-ABL-specific titers ranged from 1:10(3) to 1:10(6) (median 1:10(4)) above the limit of detection. This was the rationale to purge the grafts using two cycles of IgM anti-CD10, CD19, and AB4 MoAbs-coated immunomagnetic beads (IMB). Purging depleted median 3 (range 2-4) logs of residual leukemia, resulting in a median 1:10(1) (range 1:10(0) to 1:10(3)) postpurge BCR-ABL-specific titer. The second purging cycle accounted for 1 log of depletion. The mean +/- s.e.m. post-purge recoveries of MNC and CFU-GM were 59 +/- 4%, and 61 +/- 9%, respectively. We conclude that all BCR-ABL-positive ALL patients achieving CR by cytological criteria have critically high levels of residual leukemia in their bone marrow, which can be reduced by median 3 log using immunomagnetic bead purging.","title":"Residual leukemia and immunomagnetic bead purging in patients with BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","pubmedId":"8879615"}
