Twenty-five pairs of primary OSCCs and matched normal oral mucosa tissues were examined. The p16 gene was hypermethylated (48%) in the tumors showing significant down-regulation of both mRNA and protein expressions. A demethylation assay on 8 OSCC-derived cell lines was also performed by means of treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2\u0027-deoxycytidine. Four of 5 cell lines showing down-regulation of the p16 gene, revealed re-activation of gene expression after the treatment. In contrast, frequent over-expression of DNMT mRNA expression, also found in the expression of the proteins, was detected: DNMT1 at 72% and DNMT3A at 56%, and DNMT3B at 64%, respectively. However, we could not identify any statistical significance between p16-hypermethylation status in individual tumors and the expression of any of the three DNMTs. These data suggest that hypermethylation of the p16 gene and up-regulation of DNMTs are involved in oral carcinogenesis, but they may be through different mechanisms.","title":"Over-expression of DNA methyltransferases and CDKN2A gene methylation status in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.","pubmedId":"12738984"}
