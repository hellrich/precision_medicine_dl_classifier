HGF/c-MET plays the pivotal role in the growth, development and tolerance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of NSCLC. Moreover it has become another heat point in the molecular targeted therapy of NSCLC. c-MET amplification or high expression was deemed to another significant gene modification beyond EGFR and ALK. In the preclinical studies, HGF/c-MET inhibitors have showed the promising anti-tumor effect. Recently, some phase II/III clinical trials have proved that these inhibitors could improve the survival of patients with NSCLC. Hence we performed this review to elaborate the research progress of c-MET inhibitor in the treatment of NSCLC. \n分子靶向治疗在晚期非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）患者的治疗中起着越来越重要的作用。肝细胞生长因子/c-MET（hepatocyte growth factor/c-MET, HGF/c-MET）信号通路在NSCLC的发生、发展及NSCLC患者对表皮生长因子受体抑制剂（epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, EGFR-TKI）的耐药方面都起着重要的作用，其已经成为NSCLC分子靶向治疗的又一热点。c-MET扩增或过表达被认为可能是继EGFR和间变淋巴瘤激酶（anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ALK）融合基因之后，NSCLC又一特征性的基因突变。HGF/c-MET抑制剂也在临床前的研究中取得良好的抗肿瘤效果。近期公布的一些II期/III期临床研究的数据显示，HGF/c-MET抑制剂可以使部分c-MET扩增或过表达的NSCLC患者生存获益。因此，本文就HGF/c-MET抑制剂治疗NSCLC的研究进展做一综述。.","title":"[Research Progress of HGF/c-MET Inhibitor in the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer].","pubmedId":"25936889"}
