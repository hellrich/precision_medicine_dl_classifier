A healthy 71-year-old female with no symptoms or constitutional signs except heart murmur was hospitalized. Findings of transthoracic echocardiogram, CT scan, MRI and angiocardiogram demonstrated a mobile tumor in the right ventricular outflow tract. Transesophageal echocardiogram clearly revealed that the stalk was arising from the right ventricular free wall. Under cardiac arrest, right atriotomy was made and a gelatinous tumor (4.5 x 2 x 2 cm in size, 7.3 g in weight) was excised with 5 mm of surrounding endocardium and a few millimeters of underlying myocardium through the tricuspid valve. Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a myxoma. Her postoperative course was uneventful.","title":"[Right ventricular myxoma in a 71-year-old female].","pubmedId":"9785872"}
