In contrast, hypocellular acute lymphoblastic leukemia usually occurs in children.\nWe report two Indian patients with hypocellular acute myeloid leukemia, a 32-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy. Interestingly, one of the patients also showed bone marrow necrosis.\nHypocellular acute myeloid leukemia is a rare entity and can affect young individuals. It can be considered as a rare cause of bone marrow necrosis.","title":"Hypocellular acute myeloid leukemia with bone marrow necrosis in young patients: two case reports.","pubmedId":"19171041"}
