Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on the biopsies using specific antibodies for CD8, CD4, CD20, CD1a, and Granzyme B.\nTumor infiltration by CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes increased markedly following BRAF inhibitor treatment (both ρ \u003d 0.015). There was a correlation between the degree of tumor infiltration by CD8(+) and Granzyme B-expressing lymphocytes in post-BRAF inhibitor-treated biopsies (r \u003d 0.690 and ρ \u003d 0.013). Increased intratumoral CD8(+) lymphocyte expression was correlated with a reduction in tumor size and an increase in necrosis in posttreatment biopsies (r \u003d -0.793, ρ \u003d 0.011; and r \u003d 0.761, ρ \u003d 0.004, respectively).\nThe increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes induced by treatment with BRAF inhibitors provides strong support for conducting trials that combine BRAF inhibitors with immunotherapy in the hope of prolonging clinical responses.","title":"Selective BRAF inhibitors induce marked T-cell infiltration into human metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"22156613"}
