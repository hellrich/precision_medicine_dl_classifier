Numerous studies examining the relationship between c-erbB2 expression and prognostic impact in patients with osteosarcoma have yielded inconclusive results. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the prognostic role of c-erbB2 expression on 5-year survival, which compared the positive and negative expression of c-erbB2 in patients of the available studies. A detailed search was made in PubMed for relevant original articles published in English. Finally, a total of eight studies with 411 osteosarcoma patients were involved to estimate the relationship between c-erbB2 expression and 5-year overall survival. Positive expressions of c-erbB2 predicted poorer survival in osteosarcoma with the pooled RR of 1.53 (95 % CI 1.20-1.94, P \u003d 0.0006). In conclusion, the findings from this present meta-analysis suggest that c-erbB2 overexpression is related to poor prognostic of osteosarcoma and can be a useful clinical prognostic factor for those patients.","title":"Effect of c-erbB2 overexpression on prognosis in osteosarcoma: evidence from eight studies.","pubmedId":"24899264"}
