Several promising drugs targeting the genes most frequently altered in these tumors are under consideration. The most promising signaling pathways to be targeted for therapies in these tumors are the tyrosine kinase receptor (EGFR, HER2, c-KIT), the RAS/B-RAF/MAPK, the PI3K-mTOR, and apoptosis signaling pathways.","title":"Targeted therapies in gynecologic cancers and melanoma.","pubmedId":"19013892"}
