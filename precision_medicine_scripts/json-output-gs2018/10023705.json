Patients with beta3 positive melanomas were more likely to die of their disease (32 of 71 patients, 45%) than those with beta3 negative tumors (3 of 40 patients, 8%) (P \u003c 0.0001). The number of involved lymph nodes, Clark\u0027s level, beta1 integrin expression, thickness, and mitotic rate also had prognostic significance. beta3 integrin was associated with subsequent lung metastases and beta1 integrin with lymph node involvement.\nIntegrin expression, along with histopathologic criteria, is a prognostic marker for intermediate-thickness malignant melanoma and may indicate the site of subsequent metastasis. These observations may have clinical utility and suggest areas for future investigation.","title":"Molecular prognostic markers in intermediate-thickness cutaneous malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"10023705"}
