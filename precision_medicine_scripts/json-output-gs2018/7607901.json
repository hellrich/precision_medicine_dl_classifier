Clinically the lesion looked like a pigment patch of the naevus spilus type, while histological examination revealed the presence of dermal melanocytosis and multiple common blue naevi with a discrete lentiginous component in addition. The melanocytic nature of the infiltrate was ascertained by immunohistochemistry analysis using S 100 protein and HMB 45 antibodies. We interpret this lesion as agminated blue naevi in association with lentigo simplex, an unusual variant of speckled lentiginous naevus.","title":"[\"Blue\" variant of naevus spilus].","pubmedId":"7607901"}
