In this study, we investigated FGFR1 expression and amplification in CRC and its correlation with clinicopathologic parameters.\nFGFR1 dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization and mRNA in situ hybridization were performed on tissue array blocks composed of 291 consecutive primary CRCs.\nOf the 291 CRC cases, FGFR1 gene amplification was found in 11 (3.8%) cases, high FGFR1 polysomy in 4 (1.4%) cases, and FGFR1 gene copy number (GCN) gain (GCN \u003e2) in 77 (26.5%) cases. FGFR1 GCN gain was significantly associated with left-sided location, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and higher TNM stage (p \u003c 0.05). FGFR1 GCN gain also correlated with poor patient survival (p \u003d 0.015). FGFR1 mRNA overexpression (score 3-4) was present in 11.7% (34/291) of the patients and was significantly associated with FGFR1 GCN alteration (Pearson correlation coefficient, r \u003d 0.463; p \u003c 0.001).\nFGFR1 GCN gain was more frequently found (26.5%) than gene amplification (3.8%) and correlated with aggressive clinical behavior in consecutive CRC patients. FGFR1 GCN alteration was associated with a high FGFR1 mRNA level.","title":"Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 Gene Copy Number and mRNA Expression in Primary Colorectal Cancer and Its Clinicopathologic Correlation.","pubmedId":"26088290"}
