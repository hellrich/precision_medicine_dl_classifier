For patients with lung cancer and MPE, median survival is only 3-4 months. The aim of this study was to evaluate lung cancer patients with MPE by clinical and laboratory findings on admission, and determine 2-year survival rate and prognostic factors.\nBetween 2008 and 2011, we examined 199 cases of non-small cell lung carcinoma with MPE. Demographic factors of patients, tumor characteristics, treatment delivered and laboratory parameters affecting prognosis were evaluated. Survival rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Significance of each prognostic factors selected by univariate analysis were confirmed using Cox regression model.\nThe study included 139 (69.8%) male and 60 (30.2%) female patients with a median age of 64 (30-85) years. Median overall survival was 4.4 months. Adenocarcinoma was the leading cause of MPE with 80.4%. A univariate analysis showed that factors affecting mortality included gender (P \u003c 0.001), MPE with distant metastasis (P \u003d 0.025), lower serum albumin (P \u003c 0.0001), lower pleural protein (P \u003c 0.0001), increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (P \u003d 0.003), increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP) (P \u003c 0.0001), increased white blood cells (P \u003c 0.0001), histopathological type (P \u003d 0.004) and treatment decision (P \u003c 0.0001). A multivariate analysis revealed that patients who had high level of serum CRP (P \u003d 0.017), lower serum albumin (P \u003d 0.009) and lower pleural protein (P \u003d 0.003), MPE with distant metastasis (P \u003d 0.003) and those who were chemotherapy naive (P \u003c 0.0001) had shorter survival.\nHigh level of serum CRP, lower serum albumin and lower pleural protein, MPE with distant metastasis were most important prognostic factors for non-small cell lung carcinoma in patients with MPEs.","title":"Prognostic factors affecting survival in non-small cell lung carcinoma patients with malignant pleural effusions.","pubmedId":"25764010"}
