To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel treatment platform, which leverages the use of commercially available and clinically translatable nanoparticles (NPs) that can be combined with tumor-derived RNA to activate systemic immunity and re-program the intratumoral microenvironment from a regulatory into an immune activated locale. Methods: Since local vaccination strategies are mired with poor immunogenicity, we assessed if i.v. delivery of tumor-derived RNA encapsulated in lipophilic NPs could activate peripheral and intratumoral antigen presenting cells (APCs) for induction of therapeutic anti-tumor immunity in pre-clinical murine melanoma models. Results: We identified a clinically translatable NP formulation that when administered intravenously, mediates release of inflammatory cytokines (i.e. CCL2, IFN-alpha) into serum, systemically activates host APCs in reticuloendothelial organs, and induces precipitous upregulation of MHCI and immune activation markers (i.e. CD86) within the tumor microenvironment. Both model-antigen encoding RNA and physiologically-relevant tumor-derived RNA, when encapsulated in NPs, could expand potent anti-tumor T-cell immunity. We demonstrated that RNA-NPs harness the anti-viral defense mechanism against tumor antigens in a type I interferon dependent manner, and can be further engineered to deliver combinatorial therapies by co-encapsulating mRNAs encoding for immunomodulatory molecules (i.e. HCV PAMPs, GM-CSF). In a pre-clinical melanoma model, RNA-NPs mediate anti-tumor efficacy and significantly enhance activity of immune checkpoint mAbs when used in combination. Conclusions: By employing a systemic RNA-NP formulation encoding for both tumor RNAs and immunomodulatory molecules, as an innovative and versatile platform for delivering combinatorial therapeutics via a single treatment modality, this platform can be harnessed to simultaneously target tumor antigens and re-program the intratumoral microenvironment","title":"Overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint blockade with RNA-loaded nanoparticles.","pubmedId":"ASCO_178729-194"}
