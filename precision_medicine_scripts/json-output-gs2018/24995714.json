DCC hypermethylation was detected in 2 serum samples from patients with cancer that also amplified EDNRB and one of these samples also had p16 hypermethylation. EDNRB hypermethylation was statistically significant by Fisher\u0027s exact test (p \u003d .03) when comparing HNSCC to controls.\nSerum EDNRB hypermethylation is a highly specific but not sensitive serum biomarker for HNSCC.","title":"Serum biomarkers for detection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24995714"}
