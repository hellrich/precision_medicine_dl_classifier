Complex interactions between a set of molecules, cell cycle proteins, tumour suppressor genes, oncogenes and the telomerase, occur in the multiple step process of carcinogenesis. The 2 main ways of control of the cell cycle rely on 2 tumour suppressor genes: the P53 gene and the retinoblastoma gene or RB gene. One of the regulation pathways or the 2 regulation pathways are disabled during the development of oral and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Most of the time, the inactivation of the P53 pathway results from a loss of function of the p53 protein, secondary to mutation and/or deletion of the P53 gene; It may also result of the amplification of the MDM2 gene and of the inactivation of the arf protein. The RB pathway leads to cell proliferation by loss of the p16 protein, by amplification of the cyclin D1 gene and less frequently by mutation of the RB gene or loss of the retinoblastoma protein. In India and South-East Asia, the activation of RAS and MYC oncogenes appears to be related with the presence of specific carcinogens in snuff and tobacco. By blocking apoptosis, the Bcl2 protein seems to increase the resistance of tumours to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.","title":"[Genic alterations in oral and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas: analysis of international literature].","pubmedId":"12781800"}
