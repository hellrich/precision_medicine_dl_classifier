We report an extremely rare case of primary malignant melanoma of the esophagogastric junction mainly situated in the stomach.\nThe patient was a 72-year-old woman who complained of shortness of breath due to severe anemia. Upper endoscopy revealed a soft easy-bleeding polypoid tumor just adjacent to the esophagogastric junction in the stomach. Biopsy of the tumor did not indicate a definite result, except malignant tumor. We performed total gastrectomy with splenectomy, and histological and immunohistological examination revealed malignant melanoma of the esophagogastric junction. She had no remote metastasis or lymphnodal metastasis at the point of surgery; however, she died of multiple metastases 11 months after the operation.\nA definite preoperative diagnosis of primary malignant melanoma was very difficult to make from the preoperative biopsy specimen. This present case was first misinterpreted as undifferentiated carcinoma, or malignant lymphoma. Following the diagnosis of malignant melanoma, the question arose as to whether this was primary or metastatic (as malignant melanoma from other sites is known to metastasize to the stomach). Finally this tumor was diagnosed as a primary one due to the pathologic characteristics such as the existence of junctional activities.\nWe report an extremely rare case of primary malignant melanoma of the esophagogastric junction present in the stomach.","title":"Primary malignant melanoma of the esophagogastric junction: Report of a case.","pubmedId":"23810918"}
