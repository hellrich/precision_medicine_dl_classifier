Early disease stages may be difficult to distinguish from benign lesions such as pigmented nevi or primary acquired melanosis. We describe the therapeutic procedure and histological findings in two patients and review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of malignant conjunctival melanoma. Two female patients (84 and 85 years old, respectively) presented with a pigmented tumor close to the limbus with surrounding conjunctival pigmentation and involvement of the cornea.\nFollowing complete excision of the tumour, conjunctival malignant melanoma arising from primary acquired melanosis was diagnosed histologically. Subsequent treatment with mitomycin C eye drops was initiated. There was no recurrence of the tumor within the follow-up period (24 and 6 months).\nPatients with primary acquired melanosis need to be reviewed on a regular basis to detect malignant transformation at an early stage.","title":"[Malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva].","pubmedId":"18642211"}
