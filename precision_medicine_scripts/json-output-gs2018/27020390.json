At the heart of these promising efforts are the tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). As the reports demonstrating efficacy of modulating TIL effector function in patients with advanced stage cancer continue to accrue, it has become essential to better understand TIL immunobiology in order to further improve clinical outcome. In addition to providing an overview of the current immunotherapies available for metastatic melanoma, this review will briefly introduce the history and classification of TILs. Moreover, we will dissect the multifaceted roles of TILs in tumour-specific immunity and melanoma immune escape. The significance of TILs in melanoma prognosis and cancer immunotherapy will also be discussed, with a particular focus on their potential utility as biomarkers of patient response. The goal of personalised medicine appears to be in realistic sight, as new immunomodulatory techniques and technological innovations continue to advance the field of cancer immunotherapy. In light of recent studies highlighting the possible utility of TILs in determining therapeutic outcome, further characterisation of TIL phenotype and function has the potential to help translate individualised care into current medical practice.
