They occur either as part of a defined syndrome or are confined to the thyroid gland. Compared to their sporadic non-hereditary counterparts hereditary thyroid carcinomas generally develop earlier and regularly show multifocal tumour growth. With the exception of familial MTC, which is preceded by neoplastic C cell hyperplasia, no precursor lesions of hereditary thyroid carcinoma are known. In strong correlation with the localisation of the germline mutation of the RET protooncogene, familial MTC shows a distinct clinical course which allows precise clinical decision-making for prophylactic thyroidectomy to prevent invasive MTC. According to current knowledge prophylactic thyroidectomy of all other types of hereditary thyroid carcinoma is not justified.","title":"[Familial thyroid carcinomas].","pubmedId":"20852865"}
