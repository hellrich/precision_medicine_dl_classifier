Virus infection is the most common and strongest etiological factor for liver cancer development. Pathologically, primary liver cancer can be classified into 90% hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 510% intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and the combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC/CC) representing only a small portion. Clinically, ICC and cHCC/CC show much more aggressive behavior with poorer prognosis than HCC, and no standard treatment currently exists, other than surgical resection. ICC and cHCC/CC show varying degrees of biliary epithelial differentiation, which can be defined as liver cancer displaying a biliary phenotype (LCB). To gain insight into molecular alterations of LCBs, we performed whole genome sequencing analysis on 30 LCBs. Here we show the genome-wide substitution patterns of LCBs developed in chronic hepatitis livers overlapped with those of 60 HCCs, while those of hepatitis-negative LCBs diverged. The subsequent validation study on 68 LCBs identified recurrent mutations in TERT promoter, chromatin regulators (BAP1, PBRM1 and ARID2), a synapse organization gene (PCLO), IDH genes and KRAS. The frequencies of KRAS and IDHs mutations, which are associated with poor disease-free survival, were significantly higher in hepatitis-negative LCBs. This study reveals the strong impact of chronic hepatitis on the mutational landscape in liver cancer and the genetic diversity among LCBs.","title":"Whole-genome mutational landscape of liver cancers displaying biliary phenotype reveals hepatitis impact and molecular diversity","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-3890"}
