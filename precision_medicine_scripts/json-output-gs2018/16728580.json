IM was also found to inhibit the TK activity of BCR/ABL fusion protein produced in chronic myelogenous leukemia, with marked clinical activity against the disease. Since both PDGF-R and c-kit both having a putative role in tumorigenesis, we investigated the efficacy and safety of the use of IM in patients with endocrine tumors unresponsive to conventional therapies that expressed c-kit and/or PDGF-R (within the framework of a comprehensive phase II multi-center study of IM in patients with solid tumors). IM was initiated at a dose of 400 mg/day, with possible dose escalation within 1 week to 600 mg/day and an option to raise the dose to 800 mg/day in the event of progression and in the absence of safety concerns for a period of up to 12 months. Between September 2002 and July 2003, 15 adult patients with disseminated endocrine tumors were recruited as follows: medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC, n \u003d 6); adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC, n \u003d 4); malignant pheochromocytoma (pheo, n \u003d 2); carcinoid (non-secreting, n \u003d 2), neuroendocrine tumor (NET, n \u003d 1). No objective responses were observed. MTC--disease progression in 4 patients, and treatment discontinuation in 2 patients due to adverse events; ACC--disease progression in 3 patients, and treatment discontinuation in 1 patient due to severe psychiatric adverse event; Pheo--disease progression in 2 patients; Carcinoid--stable disease in 1 patient (6.5 months), and disease progression in 1 patient; NET--disease progression in 1 patient. IM does not appear to be useful for treatment of malignant endocrine tumors, also causing significant toxicity in this patient population.","title":"The role of imatinib mesylate (Glivec) for treatment of patients with malignant endocrine tumors positive for c-kit or PDGF-R.","pubmedId":"16728580"}
