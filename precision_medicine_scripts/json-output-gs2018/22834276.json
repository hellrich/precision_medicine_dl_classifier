The prevailing temperament in 17-year-old teenagers was hyperthymic and that in 16-year-olds was labile and introverted. The majority of the surveyed young men were extroverts, emotionally stable with a moderate useful level of situational and personal anxiety. More than 70.0% of the young men showed high social adaptation and low autonomic lability. 17-year-old young men had retarded processes as shown by moderate-low and moderate rates ofphysical development and disharmony. The most of teenagers had moderate and above-moderate levels of somatic health and a vital index that characterizes good functional, adaptive capacities of the cardiorespiratory system.","title":"[The individual health of male teenagers studying at secondary school].","pubmedId":"22834276"}
