The female to male ratio was 1.4:1 and the peak age was in the seventies. The most frequent site in males was the back and in females the legs. Superficial spreading melanoma was the most frequent type (40%); there was also a high rate of nodular melanoma (20%), particularly in males. Thin melanomas accounted for most of the cases. On follow-up 27 (13%) developed metastases in transit or in regional lymph nodes and 10 (5%) developed distant metastases; 2 (1%) had locally recurrent melanoma and 2 died of metastatic melanoma. There was a significant positive correlation between Breslow thickness, Clark\u0027s level of invasion, histopathological ulceration, nodular and acral lentiginous type of lesion and development of metastases. These data may be valuable for public and professional education and in the prediction of outcome of melanoma.","title":"[Epidemiology and prognostic factors in cutaneous malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"7557679"}
