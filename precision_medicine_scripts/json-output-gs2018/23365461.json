Similar studies are limited in children. We analyzed gene mutations and cooperation in pediatric AML with special reference on mutated epigenetic regulators. Nineteen gene mutations, including 8 class I genes, 4 class II genes, WT1 and TP53 (class III), and 5 epigenetic regulator genes (class IV), were analyzed in 206 children with de novo AML. Mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction-based assay followed by direct sequencing. One hundred seventeen of 206 patients (56.8%) had at least one mutation: 51% class I, 13% class II, 6.8% class III, and 5.6% class IV. FLT3-internal tandem duplication was most frequent, and 29% of patients had more than one gene mutation. Two patients carried ASXL1 mutations, both with t(8;21), 2 had DNMT3A mutations, 2 had IDH1 mutations, 1 had IDH2 mutation, and 3 had TET2 mutations. Both patients with IDH1 mutations had AML-M0 subtype and MLL-partial tandem duplication. Cooperating mutations with mutated epigenetic regulators were observed in 8 of 10 patients. We conclude that mutated epigenetic regulators were much less than those in adult AML but with frequent cooperating mutations. ASXL1, TET2, and IDH1 mutations were associated with specific genetic subtypes.","title":"Cooperating gene mutations in childhood acute myeloid leukemia with special reference on mutations of ASXL1, TET2, IDH1, IDH2, and DNMT3A.","pubmedId":"23365461"}
