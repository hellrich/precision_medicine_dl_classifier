Although brain metastases are common in certain cancers, including melanoma, only 3 to 5% occur in the brain stem. We present a case of metastatic melanoma from an unknown primary that initially presented as dorsal midbrain syndrome. CASE REPORT.: After a prodrome of intermittent nonspecific visual symptoms, a 60-year-old male veteran presented with bilateral upgaze paralysis and convergence retraction nystagmus. A single hemorrhagic lesion in the midbrain was causative. An inguinal mass with associated lymphadenopathy was subsequently discovered, and the biopsy from this site revealed malignant melanoma. A primary lesion was never found. The patient underwent surgical resection of the groin lesion and stereotactic radiosurgery for the midbrain metastasis but passed away 6 months after his initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS.: The presentation of bilateral vertical gaze paralysis, especially in the company of convergence retraction nystagmus, light-near dissociated pupils, or eyelid retraction, should raise concern for midbrain pathology. Although metastases to the midbrain are rare, they carry a grave prognosis, especially if melanoma is the primary malignancy, and most treatment options are considered palliative.","title":"Metastatic melanoma from unknown primary presenting as dorsal midbrain syndrome.","pubmedId":"23142879"}
