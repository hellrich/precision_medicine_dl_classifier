Because dmins are found in approximately 50% of glioblastomas, 18 gliomas were analyzed for MET amplification. Three grade IV glioblastomas and one grade II astrocytoma showed amplification. We could also localize the MET amplicon to dmins in glioblastoma TX3095 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.","title":"Amplification of the MET gene in glioma.","pubmedId":"7534113"}
