The authors conducted this study to determine the early signs of NBCCS.\nThe authors reviewed files from two Italian dental schools from January 1980 to January 1995 to determine the early signs of NBCCS and the age at which patients were first examined. They re-examined all of the patients, using the diagnostic criteria for NBCCS.\nThe authors found 14 patients who fulfilled the criteria for diagnosis of NBCCS in five families. All of the patients were 16 years of age or younger. In 11 cases (78 percent), the first sign of NBCCS in the patients was an OKC. The OKCs diagnosed in patients older than 13 years of age were large and characterized by widespread bone resorption. One 11-year-old patient had six large OKCs. The authors also found a case of multiple OKCs in an 8-year-old patient. Only one patient showed BCCs.\nOKCs are often the first signs of NBCCS and can be detected in patients younger than 10 years of age. Our data suggest that OKCs arise earlier in patients who have NBCCS than in patients who do not have NBCCS. The patients\u0027 young ages explain the low incidence of BCCs in this study.\nThe presence of multiple OKCs in a child or onset of BCC in a patient younger than 20 years of age should alert dentists to the possibility of the patient\u0027s having NBCCS.","title":"Early diagnosis of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.","pubmedId":"10332131"}
