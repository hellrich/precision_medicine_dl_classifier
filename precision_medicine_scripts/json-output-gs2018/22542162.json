Studies investigating its presence in salivary gland neoplasms are few and conflicting.\nDetection of HPV types 16 \u0026 18 was done on 34 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival material of different salivary gland neoplasms using Digene HPV types 16 \u0026 18 probe using in situ hybridization technique.\nEight of neoplastic salivary gland specimens were positively infected by HPV types 16 \u0026 18. Seven of them were benign (4 Warthin\u0027s tumour, 2 pleomorphic adenoma and one myoepithelioma), in addition to one malignant specimen (lymphoma). Correlation was found between the incidence of HPV infection and histological differentiation of salivary gland neoplasms.\nAn association exists between HPV infections and salivary gland neoplasms. However, given the sparse pattern of reactive cells, it cannot be confirmed that this virus is implicated in the aetiology of this group of tumours.","title":"Is human papilloma virus associated with salivary gland neoplasms?
