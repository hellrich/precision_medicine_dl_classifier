In squamous cell carcinoma, p63 has the highest expression and the expression of p63 in thyroid papillary carcinoma has no obvious relationship with the patients age, sex, the size and location of tumor and neoplasm metastasis.\nThe p63 masculine stem cells in thyroid could be one of the causes of some thyroid papillary carcinomas and thyroid follicular carcinomas. Thyroid papillary carcinoma, thyroid follicular carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma may have similar origins.","title":"[The significance of p63 expression in thyroid neoplasm].","pubmedId":"19160863"}
