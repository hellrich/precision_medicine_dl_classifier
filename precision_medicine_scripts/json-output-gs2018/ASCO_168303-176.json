We used a multi-gene next generation sequencing (NGS) assay to evaluate the effect of genomic alterations on outcomes. Methods: A total of 253 pts with mCRC were identified from a prospectively maintained database of pts receiving hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) therapy and who had MSK-IMPACT analysis  a targeted exome capture NGS assay that includes 410 genes. Pts were separated into two groups: those who had complete resection of liver mCRC and were treated with adjuvant (ADJ) HAI (n \u003d 136), and those with unresectable liver mCRC (METS) (n \u003d 117). In the METS group, 63 pts had no extrahepatic disease and 54 pts had extrahepatic disease. All pts were treated with HAI plus systemic therapy. Clinicopathological data including progression free survival and overall survival (OS) were recorded. Results: For differences between METS and ADJ, pts with METS had enriched mutations in BRAF (12% METS vs. 3% ADJ, p \u003d 0.006) and in SMAD4 (17.7 METS vs. 7.5% ADJ, p \u003d 0.02). These mutations were associated with worse outcomes. BRAF mutations were associated with a lower OS (p \u003d 0.01) in METS. All METS with no extrahepatic disease (n \u003d 63) who had SMAD4 mutation developed hepatic progression (p \u003d 0.02). The presence of a SMAD4 mutation was also associated with worse OS in ADJ (p \u003c 0.001). SOX9 mutation was more common in ADJ (13%) vs. METS (6%). SRC was mutated only in ADJ and only in females. Altered genes in the ERK signaling pathway includingEGFR, KRAS, NRAS, HRAS and BRAF indicated worse OS in all subgroups receiving HAI (p \u003d 0.0011 for the combined group, n \u003d 253). Conclusions: Our study confirms the alteration spectrum previously described for liver mCRC. Novel findings include the higher prevalence of SOX9 mutation in ADJ and the exclusivity of SRC mutation in ADJ female pts, implying a positive prognostic effect. SMAD4 mutation correlated with worse OS in ADJ group and increased hepatic progression in METS group. Alteration of multiple genes in the MAPK pathway conferred a worse outcome, which may be relevant for targeted drug development.","title":"Correlation between comprehensive molecular profiling and clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal liver metastases.","pubmedId":"ASCO_168303-176"}
