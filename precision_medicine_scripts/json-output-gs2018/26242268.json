The investigators (Liu Y et al.) performed a meta-analysis to study the relationship between c-erbB2 expression and prognostic impact in patients with osteosarcoma. They conducted a comprehensive and detailed meta-analysis to reveal the prognostic role of c-erbB2 for osteosarcoma. As a result, eight studies with 411 osteosarcoma patients were involved to estimate the relationship. Positive expressions of c-erbB2 predicted poorer survival in osteosarcoma patients with the pooled RR of 1.53 (95 % CI 1.20-1.94, P \u003d 0.0006). Finally, they concluded that c-erbB2 overexpression is related to poor prognostic of osteosarcoma and can be a useful clinical prognostic factor for those patients. Nevertheless, we have several queries which we would like to communicate with them.","title":"Question about Liu Y et al. entitled \"Effect of c-erbB2 overexpression on prognosis in osteosarcoma: evidence from eight studies\".","pubmedId":"26242268"}
