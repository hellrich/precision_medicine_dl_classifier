A 68-year-old male presented with a one month history of abdominal distension. CT-scanning, selective renal angiography, vena cavography and echocardiography revealed a left renal tumor with a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium through the inferior vena cava. Left nephrectomy and removal of the intra-atrial tumor thrombus were performed using extracorporeal circulation. Preoperative laboratory results showed elevation of the total bilirubin (17.0 mg/dl) due to congestion of the liver which was caused by obstruction of hepatic vein with the tumor thrombus. Postoperatively, the total bilirubin gradually decreased to 11.9 mg/dl on the third day, but increased to 22.2 mg/dl on the 9th day. So plasma exchange was performed on the 10th, 11th and 12th days, and the total bilirubin decreased to the normal range. The patient was discharged on the 50th day. For renal cell carcinoma with a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium, effectiveness of operation using extracorporeal circulation and subsequent prognosis are discussed.","title":"[Extirpation of intra-atrial tumor thrombus of renal cell carcinoma by means of extracorporeal circulation--report of a case].","pubmedId":"8478582"}
