Here we demonstrate that a xenograft tumor model can be developed in immunocompetent mice by tolerizing murine fetuses to human tumor cells. A375 human melanoma cells were injected into day E14 fetuses and, after birth, mice were challenged again with A375 cells to determine their ability to develop tumors. Intravenous injections of A375 cells after tolerization resulted in metastatic-like lung tumors, which were verified to be human in origin by immunohistochemistry and PCR. The development of lung neoplasms was dependent on fetal tolerization; non-tolerized mice did not develop tumors after injection. Interestingly, subcutaneous injected cells did not form tumors, but this was shown to be due to an innate, non-adaptive immune response and did not create lasting rejection of tumor cells. This procedure was repeated with several different tumor lines to show the universal nature of the method: BxPC3 (human pancreatic cancer), M21 (human melanoma), HeLa (human cervical cancer), and MDA231 (human breast carcinoma).","title":"Developing a xenograft human tumor model in immunocompetent mice.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-4820"}
