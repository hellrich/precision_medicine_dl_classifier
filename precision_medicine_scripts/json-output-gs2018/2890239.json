Compound and intradermal naevi were characterized by a smaller nuclear area than both Spitz naevi and malignant melanomas. Tumour ploidy could not be used as a single criterion of malignancy since both diploid and hyperdiploid melanomas were encountered. The very low mean optical density of Spitz naevi served to distinguish these lesions from malignant melanomas.","title":"DNA-cytophotometry of benign compound and intradermal naevi, Spitz epithelioid naevi and malignant melanomas.","pubmedId":"2890239"}
