A syndrome defined on clinical terms, heart failure is the end result of events occurring in multiple heart diseases, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, genetic mutations and diabetes, and metabolic dysregulation, is a hallmark feature. Mounting evidence from clinical and preclinical studies suggests strongly that fatty acid uptake and oxidation are adversely affected, especially in end-stage heart failure. Moreover, metabolic flexibility, the heart\u0027s ability to move freely among diverse energy substrates, is impaired in heart failure. Indeed, impairment of the heart\u0027s ability to adapt to its metabolic milieu and associated metabolic derangement are important contributing factors in the heart failure pathogenesis. Elucidation of molecular mechanisms governing metabolic control in heart failure will provide critical insights into disease initiation and progression, raising the prospect of advances with clinical relevance.","title":"Heart failure and loss of metabolic control.","pubmedId":"24336014"}
