Psychotherapy is seen as moving between the poles of shame and hope. Shame-anxiety alerts us to the imminent danger of being shamed; shame is described as the experience of finding our individuality unacceptable and contempt is seen as a means of coping with shame where the other is made to feel one\u0027s shame. Examples of each are provided as well as comments about psychotherapy issues with patients who exhibit shame-anxiety, shame and contempt. Shame-anxiety, shame, contempt and tyranny are seen as points along a spectrum of humiliation experiences.","title":"Shame and contempt in the everyday life of the psychotherapist.","pubmedId":"8165266"}
