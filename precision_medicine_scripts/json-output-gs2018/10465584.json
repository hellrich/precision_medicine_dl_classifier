Previous studies have shown that the incidence of ras mutation increases with progression of melanoma, but that such mutations may not be present in the earliest radial growth phase melanomas. Recently it has been proposed that introduction of ras mutations into cells deficient in tumour suppressor genes such as p16 (INK4a) is sufficient to induce characteristics of cellular transformation such as anchorage-independent growth and tumour formation in vivo. To test this hypothesis in human melanoma, mutant N-ras, mutant H-ras or wild-type H-ras genes were transfected by electroporation into WM35 cells, a p16-deficient human melanoma cell line of low invasive potential. Increased expression of mutant ras p21 enhanced anchorage-dependent cell growth on tissue culture plastic. In addition, overexpression of mutant N-ras and H-ras, but not of wild-type H-ras, increased the experimental invasive potential, inducing anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, increasing cell motility measured by time-lapse video microscopy, and increasing invasiveness through reconstituted basement membranes. Finally, overexpression of mutant H-ras in melanoma cells was shown to increase tumorigenicity and to induce cachexia when H-ras transfected cell lines were injected subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Thus the addition of activating ras mutations to a melanoma cell line already deficient in p16 leads to enhanced proliferation, survival and migration in vitro and to enhanced subcutaneous tumour formation in vivo. This phenotype is typical of the behaviour of vertical growth phase (VGP) melanoma, and we propose that activation of the ras signalling pathway in the presence of deletions in p16 or related tumour suppressors can induce the VGP melanoma phenotype.","title":"Overexpression of mutant ras in human melanoma increases invasiveness, proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and induces tumour formation and cachexia in vivo.","pubmedId":"10465584"}
