Using a monoclonal antibody that reacts with both mutant and wild-type p53 protein (PAb 1801), reactivity was assessed immunohistochemically in specimens from the first diagnosis of astrocytic neoplasm in 95 patients: 26 astrocytomas (A), 19 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), and 50 glioblastomas multiforme (GBM). Overall, 53% of cases exhibited any p53 nuclear immunoreactivity, with approximately the same proportion in each histologic grade. Survival was measured from diagnosis to death or last follow-up and ranged from 3 months to 9 years. Histologic grade was a powerful prognostic variable for this group of patients (p \u003c 0.001), with median survivals of 88, 18, and 9 months for A, AA, and GBM patients, respectively. In contrast, patients with p53-immunoreactive or -nonimmunoreactive neoplasms had median survival times of 18 or 15 months, respectively (p \u003d 0.21). These results indicate that p53 immunoreactivity was not prognostically significant in this group of adult patients with supratentorial fibrillary astrocytic neoplasms, although a small difference in survival cannot be excluded.","title":"Prognostic significance of p53 immunoreactivity in adult patients with supratentorial fibrillary astrocytic neoplasms.","pubmedId":"7866633"}
