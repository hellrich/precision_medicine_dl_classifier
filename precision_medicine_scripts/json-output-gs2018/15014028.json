Somatic mutations of BRAF kinase, a component of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, are frequently reported (\u003e65%) in nevi and malignant melanomas.\nWe assessed BRAF mutation frequency in exons 11 and 15 in primary (n \u003d 59) and metastatic (n \u003d 68) melanomas. Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed on DNA isolated and purified from microdissected tumors.\nEighteen mutations (31%) at exon 15 were detected in primary melanoma with a significantly (P \u003d 0.001) higher frequency in patients \u003c 60 years old. Incidence of BRAF mutation did not correlate with Breslow thickness. Presence of BRAF mutation of primary tumors did not effect overall disease-free survival. BRAF mutation frequency in metastatic lesions was 57% and significantly (P \u003d 0.0024) higher than primary melanomas.\nThe study suggests that BRAF mutation may be acquired during development of metastasis but is not a significant factor for primary tumor development and disease outcome.","title":"Incidence of BRAF oncogene mutation and clinical relevance for primary cutaneous melanomas.","pubmedId":"15014028"}
