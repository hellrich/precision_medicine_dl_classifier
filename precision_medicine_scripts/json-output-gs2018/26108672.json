Low-grade gliomas display a tendency to progress to more malignant phenotypes and the most frequent and malignant gliomas are glioblastomas (GBM). Another type of glioma, oligodendroglioma originates from oligodendrocytes and glial precursor cells and represents 2-5 % of gliomas. The discrimination between these two types of glioma is actually controversial, thus, a molecular distinction is necessary for better diagnosis.\niTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis was performed on non-neoplastic brain tissue, on astrocytoma grade II, glioblastoma with short and long survival and oligodendrogliomas.\nWe found that expression of nucleophosmin (NPM1), glucose regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78), nucleolin (NCL) and heat shock protein 90 kDa (HSP90B1) were increased, Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP/PEBP1) was decreased in glioblastoma and they were associated with a network related to tumor progression. Expression level of heat shock protein 27 (HSPB1/HSP27) discriminated glioblastoma presenting short (6 ± 4 months, n \u003d 4) and long survival (43 ± 15 months, n \u003d 4) (p \u003d 0.00045). Expression level of RNA binding protein nova 1 (NOVA1) differentiated low-grade oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma grade II (p \u003d 0.0082). Validation were done by Western blot, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in a larger casuistry.\nTaken together, our quantitative proteomic analysis detected the molecular triad, NPM1, GRP78 and RKIP participating together with NCL and HSP27/HSPB1 in a network related to tumor progression. Additionally, two new important targets were uncovered: NOVA1 useful for diagnostic refinement differentiating astrocytoma from oligodendroglioma, and HSPB1/HSP27, as a predictive factor of poor prognosis for GBM.","title":"Quantitative proteomic analysis shows differentially expressed HSPB1 in glioblastoma as a discriminating short from long survival factor and NOVA1 as a differentiation factor between low-grade astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma.","pubmedId":"26108672"}
