Despite the malignant phenotype of this disease, the global gene expression profiling of gastric NEC has not yet been elucidated. We have started a comprehensive molecular profiling project that analyzes genome and transcriptome of tumor obtained from cancer patients admitted to Shizuoka Cancer Center from January 2014, setting a goal to get 3,000 samples in 3 years. We had already evaluated more than 1,500 samples from various types of malignancies, including 111 samples from gastric cancer. Here, we performed deep sequencing of 409 cancer-related genes for gastric NEC patients, adding whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling, to identify a gene variant of gastric NEC.  Methods:  Surgically-resected fresh tumor samples and peripheral blood were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (Ion Proton, Life Technologies) and gene expression profiling (DNA microarray, Agilent Technologies). A total of 111 patients with gastric cancer were evaluated until August 2015, including 6 gastric NEC (5.4 %). We compared single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and gene expression profiles between gastric NEC and gastric adenocarcinoma.  Results:  All the gastric NEC patients were male with median age of 69 years (5979 years). According to classification of TNM 7th, there were two patients with stage IA, one with IIA, one with IIIB and two with IIIC. Three of them had adenocarcinoma components constituted \u003e 30% of the respective tumors, fulfilling the criteria for mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC), as defined by the WHO classification. There was no specific SNV for NEC. However, gene expression profiling identified several specific genes expressing in NEC; most of the highly expressed genes were also known to be expressed in neuroendocrine cells. Furthermore, CPLX2 and SCG3, which had been reported to be expressed in various neuroendocrine tumors, were included.  Conclusions:  Gastric NEC could be characterized by specific gene expression including those expressed in neuroendocrine cells and neuroendocrine tumors.","title":"Whole exome sequencing and gene expression profiling of neuroendocrine carcinoma in the stomach.","pubmedId":"ASCO_159708-173"}
