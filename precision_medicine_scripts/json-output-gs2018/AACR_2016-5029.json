Method: We analysed the clinical characteristics of 889 cases with non-small cell lung cancer including age, gender, smoking history, TNM stage, Pathologic grade, the expression of Ki67 and p53, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy. Then, we identified the prognosis through the follow-up. The prognostic factors of the non-small cell lung cancer patients were analysed through survival analysis.We chose the Kaplan-Meier method for the univariate analysis and the Cox proportional hazard regression model for multivariate analysis.Results:The overall median survival time of the patients were 12.87 months,and 1-year,2-year,3-year survival rates were 49%, 26% and 12% respectively. Conclusion: Smoking history,TNM stage,Performance Status score, Pathologic grade, treatment and the expression of Ki67 were independent prognostic factors.","title":"The clinical prognostic factors of 889 patients with non-small cell lung cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-5029"}
