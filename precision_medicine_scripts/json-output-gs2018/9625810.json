To determine the possible role of this gene in human ovarian tumors, we screened 31 unselected primary epithelial ovarian cancers with matched normal tissues and 7 ovarian cancer cell lines. Two homozygous deletions (4.8%) were detected in primary ovarian tumors by a semi-quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction. However, no point mutations were observed in any of the PTEN/MMAC1 coding sequences as determined by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequencing. These data indicate that PTEN/MMAC1 mutations are rare in ovarian cancers.","title":"Mutation analysis of the putative tumor suppressor PTEN/MMAC1 in human ovarian cancer.","pubmedId":"9625810"}
