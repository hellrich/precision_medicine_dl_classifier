In addition, the ErbB2/3 heterodimer forms the most potent mitogenic receptor in vitro and is key to the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Despite the importance of this heterodimer in breast cancer progression, the negative regulation of these ErbB tyrosine kinases is still poorly understood. We demonstrate here for the first time that the ErbB3/4 ligand Heregulin (HRG) reduces mRNA and protein levels of both ErbB2 and ErbB3 in human breast cancer cell lines. We have found that after 24h of HRG treatment, ErbB2 expression decreased at both the RNA and protein levels in ErbB2 overexpressing AU565, BT474 and LTLT-Ca breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, EGFR levels were unaffected by HRG treatment. An initial decline in steady state mRNA levels was first noted at 1 hour after HRG treatment. ErbB3 levels also decreased in LTLT-Ca cells after HRG treatment. Lapatinib, which inhibits ErbB2 and EGFR kinase activity and HRG induced-ErbB3 phosphorylation, diminished the HRG- induced decrease in ErbB2 and ErbB3 in AU565 and LTLT-Ca cells. This finding suggests that the kinase activity of EGFR/ErbB2 may be involved in the HRG-induced down-regulation. HRG did not change the activity of ErbB2 promoter reporter constructs spanning 215 kb to 6007 kb upstream of the ErbB2 transcription start site as indicated by luciferase assays. An ongoing study suggests that HRG could be involved in decreasing ErbB2 mRNA stability. Our findings suggest that resistance to Lapatinib may be due in part to the fact that inhibition of ErbB2/ EGFR kinase activity dampens the negative effect of HRG on ErbB2 expression, resulting in elevated levels of ErbB2 in breast cancer cells.","title":"The ErbB3/4 receptor ligand Heregulin negatively regulates ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptor levels","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1063"}
