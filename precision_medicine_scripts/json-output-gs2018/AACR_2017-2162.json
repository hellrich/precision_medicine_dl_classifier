There are no established precision medicine approaches defined in PTEN-deficient neoplasms which include prostate, breast, glioblastoma (GBM) and uterine cancers. In PTEN-mutant prostate cancer cells, the PI3K/Akt pathway collaborates with BCL-XL specifically, to regulate the apoptotic threshold (Ren, MCR 2016). Whereas single agent PI3K/Akt inhibitors are ineffective in inducing cell death, combined inhibition of PI3K/Akt and BCL-XL in PTEN-mutant prostate cancer cells results in synergistic apoptosis suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy with translational potential in this important subset of disease.Hypothesis: We hypothesized that synthetic lethality following combinatorial PI3K/BCL-XL inhibition is conserved across the range of PTEN-mutant cancers.Methods: PTEN-mutant cell lines (ATCC), validated for PTEN-loss and p-Akt expression, were assessed in apoptosis (cleaved Parp) and cell-viability assays following combined PI3K (Buparlisib, SelleckChem) and BCL-XL (A-1331852, AbbVie) inhibition (1µM each, 24h). Since MEK signaling has been associated with resistance to PI3K pathway inhibition, p-Erk was profiled as a candidate marker of resistance. The contribution of MEK signaling to the apoptotic threshold in p-Erk expressing PTEN-mutant cells was tested with pharmacological MEK inhibition (Trametinib, SelleckChem; 1,3,5 µM 48h) in combination.Results:MEK signaling and PI3K/BCL-XL inhibition in PTEN-mutant cancersSourceCell linePTENp-Aktp-ErkSynergisticApoptosis with PI3K / BCL-XLinhibitionLoss of cell viabilityp-Erksuppression with MEK inhibitionApoptosis with concomitant MEK inhibitionProstatePC3AbsentPresentAbsentYesYesN/AN/AProstateLNCaPAbsentPresentAbsentYesYesN/AN/AProstateC4-2BAbsentPresentAbsentYesYesN/AN/ABreastZR-75-1AbsentPresentWeakYesYesN/AN/AUterineSK-UT-1AbsentPresentPresentNoNoYesYesGBMA-172AbsentPresentPresentNoNoYesNoCervixC33-AAbsentPresentPresentNoNo--Conclusions: Synthetic lethality in PTEN-mutant tumor cells with PI3K/BCL-XL inhibition was confined to tumor cells without active MEK signaling. MEK inhibition inconsistently overcomes resistance to therapy suggesting heterogeneity of survival pathways in p-erk expressing PTEN-deficient tumors. These data have implications for precision medicine approaches in PTEN-deficient tumors as absence of p-Erk expression may predict for a responsive phenotype.","title":"MEK signaling marks resistance to synthetic lethality induced by PI3K/Akt and BCL-XL inhibition in PTEN-mutant cancers.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-2162"}
