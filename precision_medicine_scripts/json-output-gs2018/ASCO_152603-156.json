However, there is limited data on the patient/tumor characteristics associated with PD-L1 expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SqCC).  Methods:  PD-L1 (E1L3N, 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology), PTEN, and CD8 IHC were performed on tissue microarrays of resected SqCCs (n \u003d 162). Subsets of patients underwent clinical molecular (SNaPshot) and FISH testing. Cases with 10% or more tumor cells exhibiting negative or reduced PTEN expression were considered to have PTEN loss. PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and CD8 expression in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were semiquantitatively evaluated. PD-L1 expression, defined as 5% or more of the tumor cells exhibiting membranous staining, was correlated with clinicopathological and molecular features as well as patient outcomes.  Results:  The study cohort consisted of 96 Stage I, 41 Stage II, 22 Stage III, and 3 Stage IV cases. Of those, 43 (27%) exhibited PD-L1 expression, which was associated with large tumor size (p \u003d 0.001), advanced pathologic stage (Stage II or higher vs. Stage I, p \u003d 0.041), nodal metastasis (p \u003d 0.014), increased CD8+ TILs (grade 2-3 vs. 0-1, p \u003c 0.001), and PTEN loss (p \u003d 0.019) by univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, large tumor size (p \u003d 0.048) and increased CD8+ TILs (p \u003c 0.001) remained significant. A Cox proportional-hazards model revealed a borderline significance of PD-L1 expression with shorter progression free survival (PFS) (p \u003d 0.063), while advanced pathologic stage was associated with shorter PFS (p \u003d 0.02) and increased CD8+ TILs with longer PFS (p \u003d 0.01).  Conclusions:  As reported in other tumors, PD-L1 expression is significantly associated with CD8+ TILs in SqCC, and it may predict unfavorable patient outcomes. Interestingly, it is also associated with PTEN loss. There are currently limited targeted therapy options for SqCC, but blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may offer promising treatment options for SqCC patients with PD-L1 expression.","title":"Clinicopathological characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein expression.","pubmedId":"ASCO_152603-156"}
