It can be described as coexistence of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma with no transition zone between them.\nOur review identified a correlation between gender and MTC affected region.\nWe performed a retrospective study of 312 consecutive patients, diagnosed for MTC localized on face and scalp. Statistical analysis was made to determinate most affected areas, gender prevalence, average age, presence of ulceration and infiltration and peripheral clearance rate.\nA relevant difference came out between two genders. Ï‡2 test emphasized a relation between males and the presence of carcinoma on the scalp. In addition a strong correlation between mixed subtype and ulceration was evident. A strong relation between intermediate subtype and positive surgical margin was found; this data could identify a more aggressive behavior of intermediate type.\nIn our findings an important correlation between sun exposition and this tumor was found. Moreover, due to the difficulties that can occur in preserving the aesthetic subunits in the surgical treatment of these regions, the prevention of this pathology has an important role.","title":"Metatypical carcinoma of the head: a review of 312 cases.","pubmedId":"23242716"}
