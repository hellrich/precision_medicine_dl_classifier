We adapted a microfluidic device to capture circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with melanoma and in a mouse model. In eight patients followed longitudinally, CTC numbers were correlated with response and progression on B-RAF/MEK, CDK4/6 and PDL1 inhibitors. Consistent with this trend, in a mouse model of tamoxifen-inducible B-RAF/PTEN-driven melanoma, CTCs declined within four days of treatment with a B-RAF inhibitor. In this model, CTCs are shed very early in tumorigenesis, and a four week course of B-RAF inhibition after resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to prevent the subsequent development of cutaneous metastases. Whereas primary and metastatic mouse melanomas are highly similar, RNA sequencing of CTCs identifies significant differences in expression, generating a signature that is correlated with invasiveness and motility in human melanoma.","title":"Isolation and molecular characterization of circulating melanoma cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4832"}
