Three methods were used to demonstrate the presence of neurotoxin-responsive Na+ channels in two hybrid cell lines resulting from the fusion of excitable human neuroblastoma cells with mouse fibroblasts. Only one of the two electrically active hybrid cell lines maintained the sensitivity of the neuroblastoma parent to tetrodotoxin (TTX). The other hybrid, although electrically active, was not responsive to TTX or scorpion venom. Comparisons of the patterns of expression of membrane excitability and of chromosome complements in these human neuroblastoma cell hybrids suggest that the phenotype of membrane excitability is composed of genetically distinct elements.","title":"Membrane excitability expressed in human neuroblastoma cell hybrids.","pubmedId":"2456956"}
