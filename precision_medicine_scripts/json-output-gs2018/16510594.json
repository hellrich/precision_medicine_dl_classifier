We identified a novel mechanism by which integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates ErbB2 expression, Ras activation, and the invasion of breast carcinoma cells. Here we show that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates Ras activity especially in serum-depleted condition. Down-regulation of beta(4) integrin by beta(4) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreased Ras activity and carcinoma invasion whereas reexpression of this integrin restored Ras activity. ErbB2, a binding partner of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and EGFR modulated Ras activity, and integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulated phospho-EGFR level without affecting EGFR expression. We also found that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) is involved in ErbB2 expression. Depletion of beta(4) by shRNA reduced ErbB2 protein level without affecting ErbB2 mRNA level and reexpression of beta(4) increased ErbB2 protein level. Reduction of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, a rate-limiting factor for cap-dependent translation, decreased ErbB2 protein level, and beta(4) shRNA cells exhibited a shift in ErbB2 mRNA to light polysomes compared with control cells. These results show that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates ErbB2 through translational control. In summary, we propose a novel mechanism for ErbB2 up-regulation and Ras activation in serum-depleted breast cancer cells; integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates the expression of ErbB2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of EGFR and activation of Ras. These findings provide a mechanism that substantiates the reported role of alpha(6)beta(4) in carcinoma invasion.","title":"A novel mechanism for integrin-mediated ras activation in breast carcinoma cells: the alpha6beta4 integrin regulates ErbB2 translation and transactivates epidermal growth factor receptor/ErbB2 signaling.","pubmedId":"16510594"}
