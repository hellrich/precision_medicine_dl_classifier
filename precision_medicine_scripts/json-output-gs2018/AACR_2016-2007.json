Both overexpression of the transcription factor LMO1 and the polymorphisms within this gene locus are associated with the susceptibility to neuroblastoma, but the oncogenic roles of LMO1 in neuroblastoma pathogenesis have not been elucidated. The roles of LMO1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) are better understood, and these suggest that some of its effects may be similar between the two malignancies. Here we identify the transcriptional regulatory program controlled by LMO1 in neuroblastoma and T-ALL cells. Knockdown of LMO1 induces apoptotic cell death in both tumor types. ChIP-seq and microarray analyses demonstrate that LMO1 frequently co-occupies its target genes with GATA3 and regulates gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. LMO1 positively regulates genes involved in neuronal development, tumor invasion and metastasis in neuroblastoma cells, whereas it regulates genes involved in lymphopoiesis and immune function in T-ALL cells. Gene set enrichment analysis reveals that many genes bound by LMO1 and GATA3 are significantly downregulated upon MYCN knockdown in the MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. Importantly, LMO1 binds at the CDK6 gene locus, which is associated with a super-enhancer both in neuroblastoma and T-ALL cells. The mRNA expression of CDK6 is positively correlated with LMO1 expression in primary neuroblastoma samples. Knockdown of LMO1 downregulates CDK6 protein expression, whereas overexpression of LMO1 upregulates CDK6 expression. CDK6 knockdown induces apoptosis both in neuroblastoma and T-ALL cells. Our results indicate that CDK6 is a critical downstream target that is directly activated by LMO1 and is required for cell survival in neuroblastoma and T-ALL cells.","title":"Transcriptional regulatory program controlled by the oncogenic transcription factor LMO1 in neuroblastoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2007"}
