We reviewed the outcomes of imatinib-resistant CML patients (chronic phase, n \u003d 34; accelerated phase [AP], n \u003d 9; and blast phase [BP], n \u003d 4) who underwent HSCT and had BCR-ABL1 sequencing. Mutations were found in 19 patients (40%); 15 of 19 had advanced CML (AP + BP + second chronic phase). Patients with mutations were more likely to transform to AP/BP at time of imatinib failure (69% vs 35%, P \u003d .03). Forty-two patients (89%) responded to HSCT: 32 (68%) had at least a major molecular response. The 2-year event-free survival was 36% and 58% (P \u003d .05) for the mutant and nonmutant groups, respectively; and the 2-year overall survival was 44% and 76% (P \u003d .02), respectively. HSCT is an important salvage option for TKI-resistant patients with or without BCR-ABL1 mutations. Patients with mutations were more likely to develop advanced disease and had worse outcomes after HSCT. HSCT should be considered early for patients deemed to have a low probability of responding to second-generation TKI.","title":"Results of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia patients who failed tyrosine kinase inhibitors after developing BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations.","pubmedId":"21156844"}
