Extension of an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the larynx and trachea to the thyroid with manifestation as a thyroid nodule is extremely rare. However, this possibility always should be considered whenever there are cytologic features suggestive of adenoid cystic carcinoma in thyroid aspirates and when there is a history of adenoid cystic carcinoma in the trachea or larynx or in any part of the body.","title":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma: a pitfall in aspiration cytology of the thyroid.","pubmedId":"15080307"}
