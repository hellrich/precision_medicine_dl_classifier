All ChCs, 19 PRCCs, 2 CRCCs, and 1 oncocytoma were CK7+; all ChCs, 22 oncocytomas, 2 CRCCs, and no PRCCs expressed KIT; PAX2 was positive in 31 CRCCs, 17 PRCCs, 20 oncocytomas, and 1 ChC. The predominant expression profiles were as follows: CRCC, CK7-/KIT-/PAX2+ (26/37); PRCC, CK7+/KIT-/PAX2+ (17/20); ChC, CK7+/KIT+/PAX2- (10/11); and oncocytoma, CK7-/KIT+/PAX2+ (19/23). Cytogenetic analysis showed that the sole PAX2+ ChC had a retained chromosome 10, and all ChCs with chromosome 10 loss were PAX2-. These results identify specific staining patterns of the 4 major histologic subtypes of renal neoplasms and raise the question of a relationship between chromosome 10 loss and loss of PAX2 expression in ChC.","title":"Immunohistochemical analysis for cytokeratin 7, KIT, and PAX2: value in the differential diagnosis of chromophobe cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17210525"}
