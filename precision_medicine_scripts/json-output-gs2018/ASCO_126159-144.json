We evaluated sequential levels of serum IL-8 in preclinical tumor models and in patients with multiple tumor types, at baseline and following anticancer treatment to assess its ability to estimate tumor burden.  Methods:    IL-8 levels were monitored by sandwich ELISAs in cultured tumor cell supernatant, tumor-xenografted mice serum and in 119 cancer patients serum and urine samples, at baseline and following anticancer treatments. We correlated IL-8 levels with baseline tumor burden and with treatment induced changes in tumor burden, as well as with cancer prognosis.  Results:    IL-8 concentrations correlated with the number of IL-8 producing tumor cells in culture. In xenografted neoplasms, IL-8 serum levels rapidly dropped after surgical excision, indicating an accurate correlation with tumor burden. In patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non small cell lung cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma, serum IL-8 concentrations correlated with tumor burden and stage, survival and objective responses to therapy, including those to BRAF inhibitors and immunoregulatory antibodies. IL-8 concentrations in urine were mainly elevated in tumors with direct contact with the urinary tract.  Conclusions:    IL-8 levels correlate with tumor burden in preclinical models and in cancer patients. IL-8 is a potentially useful biomarker to monitor changes in tumor burden following anticancer therapy, and has prognostic significance.","title":"Serum interleukin-8 and its relationship to tumor burden and treatment response across malignancies of multiple tissue origins.","pubmedId":"ASCO_126159-144"}
