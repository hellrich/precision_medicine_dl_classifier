Among AML with normal karyotype (NK-AML) FLT3 activating mutation, internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), is present in about 30% of patients, conferring unfavorable outcome. Our previous data demonstrated specific up-regulation of miR-155 in FLT3-ITD+ AML. miR-155 is known to be directly implicated in normal hematopoiesis and in some pathologies such as myeloid hyperplasia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\nTo investigate about the potential influence of miR-155 de-regulation in FLT3-mutated AML we generated a transcription factors regulatory network and combined this with data from multiple sources that predict miR-155 interactions. From these analyses, we derived a sub-network, called \"miR-155 module\" that describes functional relationship among miR-155 and transcription factors in FLT3-mutated AML. We found that \"miR-155 module\" is characterized by the presence of six transcription factors as central hubs: four miR-155 regulators (JUN, RUNX1, FOSb, JUNB) and two targets of miR-155 (SPI1, CEBPB) all known to be \"master\" genes of myelopoiesis. We found, in FLT3-mutated AML, a significant down-regulation of miR-155 target genes CEBPB and SPI1 and up-regulation of miR-155 regulator genes JUN and RUNX1. We also showed that PKC412-related FLT3 inhibition, in MV4-11 cell line, causes down-regulation of miR-155 and increased level of mRNA and protein of miR-155 target SPI1. We showed in experiments of miR-155 mimic in K562 cell line, a high increase of miR-155 and an inverse correlation with the mRNA levels of its targets SPI1 and CEBPB. Moreover silencing of miR-155 in primary AMLs causes mRNA up-regulation of its target SPI1 and CEBPB.\nOur results suggest that activating mutation of FLT3 in AML can lead, through the induction of JUN, to an increased expression of miR-155, which then causes down-regulation of SPI1 and CEBPB and consequently may causes block of myeloid differentiation.","title":"miR-155 regulative network in FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"26055960"}
