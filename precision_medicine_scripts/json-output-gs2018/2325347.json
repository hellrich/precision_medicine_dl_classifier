The authors report on a 47-year-old woman who, years after local excision of a recurrent limbal conjunctival melanoma, developed an epibulbar melanoma far from the site of the original scar. The authors attribute this recurrence to lymphogenic propagation.","title":"[Lymphogenic dissemination of an epibulbar melanoma].","pubmedId":"2325347"}
