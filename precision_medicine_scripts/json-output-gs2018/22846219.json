In all countries, more than 70% of physicians started GC screening between 40 and 59 years. The most popular method to screen for GC was endoscopy (92.7%), but combination methods such as Helicobacter pylori (HP) antibody, barium X-ray, and tumor marker with endoscopy differed by country. For HP-positive individuals, most physicians screened every year by endoscopy, and for individuals post-HP eradication, about half of physicians (56.3%) thought there was a need to follow-up with GC screening. Among all physicians, the most common age to start CRC screening was in the 40s (39.8%) and 50s (40.9%). Based on the American Cancer Society Recommendations, a fecal occult blood test every year was the most popular method for CRC screening overall. However, among each country, this test was most popular in only Japan (76.9%) and Indonesia. In other countries, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years and total colonoscopy every 10 years were the most popular methods.\nThere are similarities and differences in the screening of GC and CRC among East Asian countries.","title":"A questionnaire-based survey on screening for gastric and colorectal cancer by physicians in East Asian countries in 2010.","pubmedId":"22846219"}
