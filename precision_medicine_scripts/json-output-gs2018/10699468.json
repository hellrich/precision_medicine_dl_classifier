In this study, we have examined the effect of beta-catenin mutation (S37F) or APC loss on the proteasome sensitivity of additional subcellular beta-catenin pools in melanoma cells. In contrast to detergent-soluble beta-catenin, the detergent-insoluble protein remains proteasome-sensitive irrespective of S37F mutation or APC status. This insoluble component appears associated primarily with nuclear cytoskeletal elements. In addition, DNase I treatment solubilized a portion of detergent-insoluble beta-catenin, suggesting that this fraction also contains chromatin-associated protein, and correlating with a proteasome-sensitive elevation in beta-catenin-stimulated reporter activity. Since the detergent-insoluble nuclear component of beta-catenin displays GSK-3beta- and APC-independent proteasome sensitivity, distinct from the soluble nuclear and cytosolic pools of this protein, regulation of beta-catenin proteasome sensitivity and the contribution of this process to beta-catenin function may be more complex than previously appreciated.","title":"Nuclear beta-catenin displays GSK-3beta- and APC-independent proteasome sensitivity in melanoma cells.","pubmedId":"10699468"}
