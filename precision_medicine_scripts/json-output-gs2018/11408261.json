Transmembrane transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) may modulate EGFR function through an autocrine/juxtacrine mechanism. The present study aimed to determine the contribution of membrane-bound precursors of TGF-alpha in enhancing EGFR activation in the gastric and colonic mucosa during aging. The extent of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, a measure of EGFR activation, was substantially higher (300--350%) in the gastric and colonic mucosa of 23- (aged) vs. 4-mo-old (young) Fischer 344 rats. This was accompanied by an increase (200--1,000%) in the relative concentration of 18- to 20-kDa membrane-bound precursor forms of TGF-alpha. The amount of TGF-alpha bound to EGFR was also higher (150-250%) in the gastric and colonic mucosa of aged vs. young rats. In vitro studies revealed that exposure of HCT 116 cells (a colon cancer cell line) to TGF-alpha from gastric and colonic mucosal membranes of aged rats caused a 200--250% higher activation of EGFR and extracellular signal-related kinases (p42/44) compared with young rats. Our data suggest that the membrane-bound precursor form(s) of TGF-alpha may partly be responsible for enhancing EGFR activation in the gastric and colonic mucosa of aged rats, probably though an autocrine/juxtacrine mechanism(s).","title":"Increased in vitro activation of EGFR by membrane-bound TGF-alpha from gastric and colonic mucosa of aged rats.","pubmedId":"11408261"}
