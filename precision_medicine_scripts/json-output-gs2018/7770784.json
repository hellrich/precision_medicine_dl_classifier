From these, 118 patients without CNS metastases at primary diagnosis were divided into three well defined patient groups: group I consisted of 23 patients who achieved a complete remission after primary therapy and who were subsequently treated with PCI, group II consisted of 23 patients in complete remission without PCI. Group III consisted of 72 patients without CNS metastases at the primary diagnosis and without PCI treatment since they did not achieve a complete response after primary therapy. The primary therapy consisted of combined radiochemotherapy or only chemotherapy. Sixteen patients were treated only by irradiation.\nThe overall incidence of CNS metastases for all 133 patients was 33.1%. The incidence of new CNS metastases in group I was 21.7% in group II 26.1%, and in group III 22.2%. The average time to development of CNS metastases after primary diagnosis was different for the three groups: in group I 15.4 months, in group II 9.5 months and in group III 8.4 months. No statistical significance was noted. Median survival time for group I was 16.1 months, for group II 13.8 months and 8.4 months for the group III. No statistical significance was achieved between group I and II (P \u003e 0.05).\nThese data suggest that treatment with PCI appears to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of subsequently CNS metastases or to improve survival of SCLC patients. We recommend the use of PCI only in well defined clinical studies.","title":"[Usefulness of prophylactic whole brain irradiation in small-cell bronchial carcinoma].","pubmedId":"7770784"}
