We investigated the correlations between free methylated DNA and CTC in the blood from breast cancer patients with clinical signs. Methods: Sera were analysed by methylation specific PCR for 5 genes: adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), ras association domain family protein 1A (RASSF1A), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), CDKN2A (p16) and glutathione s-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) in 85 breast cancer patients and 22 healthy volunteers. Beta actin (ACTB) served as control. In parallel matched peripheral blood of 63 patients was used to assay for circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood by a modified immunomagnetic AdnaTest BreastCancerSelect with PCR detection for EPCAM, MUC1, MGB1 and SPDEF. Results: APC hypermethylation was 29%, RASSF1A 26%, GSTP1 18% ESR1 38% of breast cancer patients. No hypermethylation of CDKN2A was found. Blood samples were found CTC positive by detecting EPCAM 13%, MUC1 16%, MGB 9%, SPDEF 12% and in 27% detecting one or more genes. A significant difference was seen in methylated APC DNA between cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Methylated APC, RASSF1 and CTC were different in metastatic disease. Methylated APC, RASSF1A and CTC correlated significantly with AJCC-staging (p \u003d 0.001, p \u003d 0.031 p \u003d 0.002). High incidences were found for methylated RASSF1 and ESR1 in healthy individuals (5/22). Methylated GSTP1 was predominantly found in the serum of patients with large primaries (p \u003d 0.023) and significantly correlated with positive HER2/neu status (p \u003d 0.003). Elevated serum CA15.3 strongly correlated with methylated APC and CTC (p \u003d 0.001). Methylated ESR1 failed to exhibit significant correlations with any parameters. The presence of CTC in peripheral blood was associated with the methylated APC (p \u003d 0.012) and methylated GSTP1 (p \u003d 0.001). Conclusions: The detection of methylated APC and GSTP1 DNA in serum correlated with the presence of CTC in the blood of breast cancer patients. Both methylated DNA and CTC did not show exclusive specificity but were a phenotypic feature of more aggressive tumor biology and advanced disease.","title":"Free methylated serum DNA in association of clinical signs and circulating blood tumor cells in breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_60046-100"}
