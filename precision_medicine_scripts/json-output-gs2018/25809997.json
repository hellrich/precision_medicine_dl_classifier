Over a 10-yr interval, NPM1 mutation analysis was performed in 152 CMML at our institution. NPM1 mutations were identified in 8 (5.3%) patients, five men and three women, with a median age of 72 yr (range, 27-87). In all patients, the bone marrow was hypercellular with multilineage dysplasia, monocytosis, and retained maturation supporting a diagnosis of CMML. NPM1 mutation allele burden was \u003c5% in two patients and \u003e10% in six patients. Four (50%) patients, all with \u003e10% NPM1, progressed AML with a median interval of 11 months (range, 1-21). Compared with 144 CMML without NPM1 mutations, CMML patients with NPM1 mutation presented with more severe anemia (P \u003d 0.053), higher BM monocyte percentage (P \u003d 0.033), and an increased tendency for AML progression (P \u003d 0.088) and an inferior overall survival (P \u003d 0.076). Mutations involving NRAS/KRAS (2/7), TET2(2/5), ASXL1(1/5,) and FLT3(0/8) were not significantly different between these two groups. In summary, CMML with NPM1 mutation shows histopathological features of CMML, but patients appear to have a high probability for AML progression and may require aggressive clinical intervention, especially in patients with a high mutation burden.","title":"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutation.","pubmedId":"25809997"}
