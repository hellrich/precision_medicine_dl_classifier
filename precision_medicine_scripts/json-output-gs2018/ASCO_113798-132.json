Since clinical mechanisms of resistance (MoR) result in MAPK pathway reactivation, recent efforts have focused on combined targeting of RAF and MEK. The combination of D and T (D/T) increased progression-free survival and response rate compared with D alone (Flaherty et al, NEJM, 2012). The MoR to this combination remain unknown. Methods:  To look for clinical MoR to combined RAF/MEK inhibition, we performed whole exome (WES) and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) on tumors from 4 patients (pts) with acquired resistance and 1 pt with intrinsic resistance to D/T. Pre-treatment and post-resistance tumors from all pts were analyzed for point mutations, insertions/deletions, copy number alterations, alternatively spliced transcripts, rearrangements, and expression changes. Results:  In 2 of 4 pts with acquired resistance, WES identified mutations in MEK1 and MEK2 that were undetectable in the pre-treatment tumors.  In the 3rd pt, RNASeq identified an alternatively spliced isoform of BRAF lacking exons 2-10, also undetectable in the pre-treatment tumor. In the 4th pt, no obvious MoR were seen, though multiple alterations were enriched in the post-resistance tumor. The pt with intrinsic resistance had several alterations in genes that conferred resistance to RAF/MEK inhibition when overexpressed in BRAF-mutant cell lines. Integration of WES and RNASeq data also identified several co-existing alterations that may synergize to increase resistance. Conclusions:  Analysis of combined WES and RNASeq data from pt samples provides a more complete picture of clinical MoR to MAPK-targeted therapy. Post-resistance tumors from 3 of 4 pts with acquired resistance to D/T had alterations in MAPK genes not detectable in the pre-treatment tumors, suggesting that resistance involves reactivation of the MAPK pathway despite combined RAF/MEK inhibition. Alternative dosing of current agents, more potent RAF/MEK inhibitors, and/or inhibition of the downstream kinase ERK may be needed for durable control of BRAF-mutant melanoma.","title":"Whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing in melanoma patients to identify mechanisms of resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition.","pubmedId":"ASCO_113798-132"}
