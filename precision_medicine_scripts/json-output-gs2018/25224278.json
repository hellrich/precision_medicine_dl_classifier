It exerts various functions in shaping protumoral vascularization and inflammation/immunity. We evaluated sequential levels of serum IL8 in preclinical tumor models and in patients to assess its ability to estimate tumor burden.\nIL8 levels were monitored by sandwich ELISAs in cultured tumor cells supernatants, tumor-xenografted mice serum, and in samples from 126 patients with cancer. We correlated IL8 serum levels with baseline tumor burden and with treatment-induced changes in tumor burden, as well as with prognosis.\nIL8 concentrations correlated with the number of IL8-producing tumor cells in culture. In xenografted neoplasms, IL8 serum levels rapidly dropped after surgical excision, indicating an accurate correlation with tumor burden. In patients with melanoma (n \u003d 16), renal cell carcinoma (RCC; n \u003d 23), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n \u003d 21), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n \u003d 30), serum IL8 concentrations correlated with tumor burden and stage, survival (melanoma, n \u003d 16; RCC, n \u003d 23; HCC, n \u003d 33), and objective responses to therapy, including those to BRAF inhibitors (melanoma, n \u003d 16) and immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies (melanoma, n \u003d 8). IL8 concentrations in urine (n \u003d 18) were mainly elevated in tumors with direct contact with the urinary tract.\nIL8 levels correlate with tumor burden in preclinical models and in patients with cancer. IL8 is a potentially useful biomarker to monitor changes in tumor burden following anticancer therapy, and has prognostic significance.","title":"Serum interleukin-8 reflects tumor burden and treatment response across malignancies of multiple tissue origins.","pubmedId":"25224278"}
