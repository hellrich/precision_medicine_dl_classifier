Prevalence of such mutations during the disease progression phases and among the different types of metastasis still remains inconclusive. Methods: A total of 275 tumour tissues from 116 melanoma patients were screened for mutations; among them, paired samples of microdissected primary melanomas (N\u003d92) and synchronous or asynchronous metastases (N\u003d156) from same patients were included. Tissue samples underwent mutation analysis by automated DNA sequencing. Secondary lesions were from: lymph nodes (LM; N\u003d77), skin (SM; N\u003d36), visceral (VM; N\u003d23) and brain (BM; N\u003d 44) sites. The full coding sequences and splice junctions of p16CDKN2A (exons 1, 2, and 3) and NRAS (exons 2 and 3) genes as well as the entire sequence at the exon 15 of the BRAF gene were screened for mutations by direct sequencing on automated fluorescence-cycle sequencer (ABIPRISM 3130, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Results: Overall, mutations were identified in 56/95 (59%) primary melanomas [43% BRAF - 16% NRAS], 49/77 (64%) lymph nodes [48% BRAF - 16% NRAS], 22/36 (61%) subcutaneous metastases [53% BRAF - 8% NRAS], 13/23 (57%) visceral metastases [43% BRAF - 13% NRAS], and 31/44 (70%) brain metastases [48% BRAF - 23% NRAS]. Overall, a slight and not significant increase in mutation frequency after progression from primary melanoma was observed in our series: 115/180 (64%) mutated metastases [48% BRAF - 16% NRAS]. Considering the paired samples from the same patients, LM (92% consistency) and VM (96% consistency) presented a highly similar prevalence and distribution of BRAF/NRAS mutations in comparison with primary melanomas, whereas a discontinuous pattern of mutations was detected in BM (80% consistency) or, mostly, SM (75% consistency). Occurrence of distinct mutation distribution between primary melanomas and correspondent metastases suggests that independent subclones have been generated in a limited fraction of patients. The rate of mutations in p16CDKN2A gene was found to steadily increase moving from primary melanomas (5/69; 7%) to melanoma metastases (21/144; 15%), with the highest prevalence of p16CDKN2A alterations (18/29; 62%) in melanoma cell lines Conclusions: Our results provide further clues about the impact of NRAS and BRAF mutations among the different stages of melanoma progression. Moreover, we confirmed that p16CDKN2A mutation rates are increasing during disease progression.","title":"Pattern and distribution of BRAF/NRAS and P16CDKN2A mutations among primary an secondary lesions in melanoma patients","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-3677"}
