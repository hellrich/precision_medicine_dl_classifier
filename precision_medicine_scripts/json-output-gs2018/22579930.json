The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in the Taiwanese population with colorectal cancer. This study was undertaken to identify BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in patients with colorectal cancer by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. HRM analysis is a new gene scan tool that quickly performs the PCR and identifies sequence alterations without requiring post-PCR treatment.\nIn the present study, DNAs were extracted from 182 cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colorectal cancer samples for clinical KRAS mutational analysis by direct sequencing. All the samples were also tested for mutations within BRAF V600E and PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20) by HRM analysis.\nThe results were confirmed by direct sequencing. The frequency of BRAF and PIK3CA mutations is 1.1%, and 7.1%, respectively. Intriguingly, we found that nine patients (4.9%) with the KRAS mutation were coexistent with the PIK3CA mutation. Four patients (2.2%) without the KRAS mutation were existent with the PIK3CA mutation. Two patients (1.1%) without the KRAS mutation were existent with the BRAF mutation.\nIn the current study, we suppose that HRM analysis is rapid, feasible, and powerful diagnostic tool for the detection of BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in a clinical setting. Additionally, our results indicated the prevalence of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutational status in the Taiwanese population.","title":"Characteristics and prevalence of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in colorectal cancer by high-resolution melting analysis in Taiwanese population.","pubmedId":"22579930"}
