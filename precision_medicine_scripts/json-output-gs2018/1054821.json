Through cytochemical examinations, the malignant disease could be identified as an acute myeloid leukemia. The blasts in the tumourous tissues show less differentiation than the leukemic blood and bone marrow cells. The lack of maturation of the blasts is discussed as the cause of tumorlike cell growth.","title":"[Different maturation of leukemic blasts in tumor--like type of acute infantile leukemia (author\u0027s transl)].","pubmedId":"1054821"}
