Objectives of this study were to define the proportions of the driver gene alterations and to examine survival in genotype-specific subsets of NS NSCLC.  Methods:  We identified 243 NS NSCLC pts treated at our Institution from October 2003 to January 2014. Pts with tissue available for biological analysis were as follows: 207 pts (85.1%) assessable for EGFR/KRAS mutation, 77 (31.6%) for ALK rearrangement, 37 (15.2%) for ROS1 rearrangement, 33 (13.5%) and 32 (13.1%) for RET fusion and HER2 mutation. The cohort comprised 58% women, median age 62, 86% advanced adenocarcinomas (10% brain metastases at diagnosis).  Results:  Out of 207 tumors, frequency of EGFR and KRAS mutation was 42.5% (88 pts) and 7.7% (16), respectively. Among pts screened for ALK, ROS1, RET, HER2, the proportion of individual testing, were 25.9% (20), 13.5% (5), 9% (3), 0%. 228 pts were evaluable for treatment and outcomes.158 pts (69%) received at least one line of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), of which 42 (27%) as first line. 16 pts (7%) received an ALK/ROS1 inhibitor, and 8 pts (4%) had both treatments, 50 pts (21%) received exclusively chemotherapy. Median progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment with first line EGFR TKI was 13.2 months (mo) vs 5.3 mo for chemotherapy (p\u003c0.001). Median PFS after a II line TKI (114 pts) was 14.1 mo. Median overall survival (OS) for EGFR mutans, ALK/ROS1 positive and chemotherapy-only treated pts was: 31.8 mo, not reached, and 14.1 mo, respectively (p\u003c0.001). Median OS for KRAS mutated vs KRASwt pts was 32.2 mo vs 17.4 mo (p 0.363).  Conclusions:  The study confirmed the clinical and outcome features which make lung cancer in NS a distinct disease. Of particular note is the marked increase in OS with EGFR TKI therapy when evaluating this subset in contrast to previous studies not specifically focusing on NS.","title":"Clinical features and outcome in never-smoker (NS) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (pts): A single-institution observational analysis.","pubmedId":"ASCO_133979-144"}
