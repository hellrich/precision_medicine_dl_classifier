Most of them result from dedifferentiation of astrocytoma to glioblastoma. We present two cases of unusual de novo cerebellar glioblastomas, one of which is the giant-cell variant. We review their clinical behaviour with conventional MR imaging features and discuss the key findings that can lead to the correct diagnosis in sight of new MR imaging technologies.","title":"Primary cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme.","pubmedId":"15957093"}
