However, the involvement of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in this process remains elusive. Here we demonstrated that mouse lncRNA BB179049 and its human ortholog WDFY3-AS2 were significantly increased upon TGF-induced EMT. WDFY3-AS2 was frequently elevated in invasive, metastatic and triple-negative breast cancer. Depletion of WDFY3-AS2 abrogated TGF-induced EMT and breast cancer metastasis. WDFY3-AS2 positively regulates STAT3 and WDFY3 through interaction with hnRNP-R. These data indicate that WDFY3-AS2 could play a pivotal role in TGF-induced EMT and metastasis and serves as a critical therapeutic target in aggressive breast cancer.","title":"LncRNA WDFY3-AS2 contributes to the EMT and metastasis in breast cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-998"}
