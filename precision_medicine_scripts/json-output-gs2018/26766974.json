Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapy has been applied in advanced common NSCLC. Whether EGFR-targeted therapy is also suitable for LELC of the lung remains unclear. As we know, EGFR gene mutation is a predictive factor. Therefore, EGFR gene mutations in exons 19 and 21 in Chinese patients with LELC of the lung were investigated.\nClinicopathological information was obtained by a retrospective review of the medical history recorded in the patients\u0027 charts. EGFR gene mutations in exons 19 and 21 were analyzed in 32 samples of LELC of the lung by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\nEleven (34.4%) of the patients were male and 21 (65.6%) patients female. The mean age at diagnosis was 50.9 years (range, 25-71 years). Seven (21.9%) of the patients were smokers. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) showed positive signals in all 32 patients. None of the tumors had mutations in exons 19 and 21. EGFR-targeted therapy was used in three patients with advanced disease and one patient with distant recurrence. However, no obvious therapeutic effect was found.\nThese data showed that LELC of the lung, a special histological type of lung cancer, lacked EGFR gene mutations in exons 19 and 21, which suggested that there was no opportunity for EGFR-targeted therapy for patients with LELC of the lung.","title":"Lack of epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations in exons 19 and 21 in primary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"26766974"}
