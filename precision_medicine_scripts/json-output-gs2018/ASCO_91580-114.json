TKI therapy is often continued beyond RECIST progression (PD). We investigated the frequency of this practice and patterns of RECIST PD via imaging findings, as well as the association between patient characteristics and discontinuation of TKI among patients (pts) who progressed while on TKI.  Methods:  Among a cohort of 101 advanced NSCLC pts with sensitizing EGFR mutations treated with first-line erlotinib or gefitinib at DFCI, 70 pts treated between 2002 and 2010 had at least two CT scans for retrospective radiographic assessments using RECIST1.1; 56 pts had experienced PD by the data closure date of June 2011.   Results:  Among 56 pts experiencing PD, 46 (82%) were female, median age was 63 (range 35-79), 28 (50%) were never-smokers, 32 (57%) had distant mets, 32(57%) had exon 19 deletion, and 50 (89%) received erlotinib. 49 pts (88%) continued TKI therapy for at least 2 mos beyond retrospectively assessed PD. 31/32 (97%) pts who progressed by increase of target lesions continued TKI. 13/16 (81%) pts who progressed by new lesion remained on TKI. Two pts with PD in non-target lesions discontinued therapy at PD. 5/6 (83%) pts with both increase of target lesions and new lesion at PD continued TKI.  In 49 continuing pts, the median time from RECIST PD to termination of TKI was 10.1 mos (range: 2.2-64.2 mos). 15/49 (31%) pts who continued TKI received additional chemo compared to 0/7 pts who discontinued (Fishers p\u003d0.17).  Pts who discontinued therapy (n\u003d7) were significantly younger (median 48 yrs) than those who continued TKI at PD (median 64 yrs, Wilcoxon p\u003d0.003). Median OS beyond RECIST PD among those who continued TKI was 31.8 mos (95% CI 15.9- not reached) and though underpowered, this did not appear to be impacted by TTP when adjusted in a Cox model (p\u003d0.84).  Conclusions:  88% of EFGR-mutant NSCLC pts who progressed on first-line TKI continued therapy beyond RECIST PD, which is not the single determining factor for terminating TKI in EGFR-mutant NSCLC pts. Additional progression criteria specific to this population are needed to better guide therapeutic decision making.","title":"Radiographic assessment and therapeutic decisions at RECIST progression in EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_91580-114"}
