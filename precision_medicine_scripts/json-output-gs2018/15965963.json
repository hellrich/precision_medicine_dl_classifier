Histologically, 80% of lung cancers are classified as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the remaining 20% as small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Lung carcinoma is the result of molecular changes in the cell, resulting in the deregulation of pathways controlling normal cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. This review summarizes some of the most recent findings about the role of cell-cycle proteins in lung cancer pathogenesis and progression.","title":"Role of cell-cycle regulators in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"15965963"}
