Resection is the only potential curative treatment and is associated with 5-year survival up to 44%. The objective of this study was to characterize the mutational landscape of patients with ICC undergoing resection and to identify potential prognostic genetic markers that may be unique to these patients. Methods: Sixty-six resected ICC tumor specimens were assessed for genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing of 410 cancer genes by Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT). We identified the gene alterations occurring with greatest frequency and grouped mutations by known cancer pathways and families, such as RAS-MAPK pathway, mTOR pathway, Notch signaling pathway, chromatin-remodeling gene family, and DNA repair gene family. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from time of resection until death and disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated from resection until recurrence or death. Kaplan Meier 5-year estimates and the log-rank test were used to evaluate the associations with OS and DFS, adjusted for multiple comparisons with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Results: The median age of all patients was 65 years (range 29-87 years). Majority of tumors were T1 (24/66, 36%) or T2 (35/66, 53%), and of moderate differentiation (46/66, 70%). Lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and periductal infiltration were present in 34 (52%), 20 (30%), and 8 (12%) patients, respectively. The median number of genetic alterations per tumor was 3 (range 0-26). The most common genetic alterations were PBRM1 (16/66, 24%), IDH1 (15/66, 23%), ARID1A (14/66, 21%) and TP53 (8/66, 12%). FGFR2 fusion mutations (5/66, 8%) were relatively rare. The median OS for all patients was 53.4 months (95%CI: 43.0-79.3 months) and median DFS was 17.4 months (95%CI: 10.4-32.6 months). None of the gene alterations or pathways were associated with OS (p \u003d 0.29-0.84) or DFS (p \u003d 0.23-0.65). Conclusions: In this cohort of resected ICC patients, genetic alterations or alterations within gene families, by themselves, did not stratify risk of disease recurrence or death.","title":"Mutational profiling of resected intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_182001-199"}
