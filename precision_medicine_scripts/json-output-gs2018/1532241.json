In this paper we describe the isolation and characterization of one of the thyroid TRK oncogenes, designated TRK-T1. A 1746-bp-long cDNA was isolated from a library derived from a primary transformant. The cDNA was able to induce foci in NIH3T3 cells. Sequence analysis revealed that TRK-T1 is created by an intrachromosomal rearrangement that juxtaposes the 5\u0027 end of the TPR gene to the TRK tyrosine kinase domain. The resulting hybrid mRNA contains 598 nucleotides of the TPR gene and 1148 nucleotides of the TRK proto-oncogene. TRK-T1 mRNA encodes a protein of 55 kDa reacting with antibodies against the carboxy terminus of the proto-TRK protein. We show also the involvement of TPR in the generation of another TRK-T oncogene.","title":"TRK-T1 is a novel oncogene formed by the fusion of TPR and TRK genes in human papillary thyroid carcinomas.","pubmedId":"1532241"}
