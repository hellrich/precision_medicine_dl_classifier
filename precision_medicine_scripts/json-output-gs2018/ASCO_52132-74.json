However, limited studies are still available for primary treatment, and PRF are not still clearly determined, above all in HER2-negative patient subgroup receiving antiangiogenic therapy. Objectives: To determine percentage of pathologic complete responses (pCR) in patients diagnosed of locally advanced BC who receive neoadjuvant sequential therapy in association with BZ, as well as to determine the PRF and perform differential analysis of treatment resistant genes. Methods: 72 patients were included in ML20382 clinical trial. Treatment was 4 cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide 60/600 mg/m2 x 21 days, followed by 4 cycles of BZ 15 mg/kg + docetaxel 75 mg/m2 x 21 days. Median age was 46 years. Stage classification was 20.8% IIA, 43.1% IIB, 23.6% IIIA, 8.3% IIIB, 4.2% IIIC. Median tumour size was 4.75 cm. 68.1% showed axillary affectation and 80.6% were hormone-receptor positive. Clinical evaluation was done by mammography and mammary ultrasound and/or NMR. Tumour samples were collected before treatment and after surgery for analysis of VEGF, VEGFR, EGFR, pAKT, pMAPK, pTEN, HIF, IGF and differential analysis of gene expression. Results: 66 patients evaluated for histopathological response, resulting in 24, 2% of pCR (CI 95%, 14,5-36.4). Multivariate analysis shows a significant increase of responses in ER-negative patients. Treatment was well tolerated, with haematological toxicity G3-4 for 22% of patients (12.5% of neutropenic fever as most noteworthy toxicities). Most relevant non-haematologic toxicity was mucositis G3 for 19.4% and hypertension for 1.4 %. Preliminary analysis shows VEGFr and KISS1 amplification entail a tendency of a lower pCR rate (8.7% and 6.25% respectively). Conclusions: Addition of BZ in preoperative treatment (AC+D) permits a high pCR rate with an adequate safety profile in a subgroup with a median of T \u003e 4 cm and predominantly ER+. VEGFR and KISS1 amplification analysis may identify treatment refractory patient subgroups.","title":"Predictive response factors (PRF) in an open, nonrandomized, phase II study of a combination of bevacizumab (BZ) and sequential chemotherapy as preoperative treatment in patients with operable HER2-negative breast cancer (BC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_52132-74"}
