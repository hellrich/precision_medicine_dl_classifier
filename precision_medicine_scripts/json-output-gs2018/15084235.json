To date, most attention has focused on the ErbB2 receptor. Now, in a recent report, it has been shown that ErbB3 is a critical partner for the transforming activity of ErbB2 in breast cancer cells. Importantly, the proliferative signals from this transforming complex appear to act via the PI-3 kinase pathway.","title":"Essential function for ErbB3 in breast cancer proliferation.","pubmedId":"15084235"}
