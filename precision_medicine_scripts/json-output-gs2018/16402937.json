The aim of this study was to genotype for these mutations a cohort of thyroid tumours collected at our institutions.\nThyroid tumours removed from 51 subjects were analysed, including 43 PTC and 8 non-PTC tumours [3 follicular adenomas (FA), 4 follicular carcinomas (FTC) and 1 anaplastic carcinoma (AC)].\nRET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 expression was evaluated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, whereas screening of BRAF (exon 15) and RAS (HRAS, KRAS2 and NRAS) mutations were performed, respectively, by single strand conformation polymorphism and denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography.\nRET/PTC expressions was positive in 5/43 (11.6%) PTC and in none of the non-PTC tumour. Similarly, BRAF mutations were positive only in PTC, but with a higher prevalence (24/43 positives, 55.8%). All but one BRAF mutation resulted in the prototypic substitution of valine 600 with a glutamic acid. In one case, a somatic in-frame insertion of three bases at codon 599 resulted in the insertion of an additional valine. RET/PTC expression and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive. Screening of the RAS gene allowed identification of oncogenic mutations in 1/3 (33.3%) FA and 3/4 (75%) FTC. None of the PTCs was positive for RAS.\nThese data indicate that BRAF mutations are the most frequent genetic event in PTC and that RAS mutations, besides being a genetic hallmark of follicular tumours, are rare or completely absent in PTC from our area. Together, BRAF mutations and rarer RET rearrangements accounted for a genetic event in two-thirds of PTCs. This study showed a novel and presumably oncogenic mutation of BRAF, which is BRAF(V599Ins).","title":"Genotyping of an Italian papillary thyroid carcinoma cohort revealed high prevalence of BRAF mutations, absence of RAS mutations and allowed the detection of a new mutation of BRAF oncoprotein (BRAF(V599lns)).","pubmedId":"16402937"}
