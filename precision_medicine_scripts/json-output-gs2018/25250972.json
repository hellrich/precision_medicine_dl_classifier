Immunoglobulins (Ig) (n \u003d 45) were measured at diagnosis and day 15.\nThere were 25 male and 20 female patients with a median age of 9 years (range 1-18 years). Baseline Ig did not correlate with any of the infection-related parameters during induction. At day 15, Ig levels reduced from baseline (IgG p \u003d 0.46, IgA p \u003d 0.027, IgM p \u003c 0.001). Day 15 IgG levels were lower in patients with persistent fever \u003e7 days (p \u003d 0.029) and fungal infection (p \u003d 0.035).\nThis is the first study which has evaluated derangement in Ig with infection-related parameters in pediatric AML. At day 15, immunoglobulins decrease and reduced IgG levels correlate with infection-related parameters. Use of intravenous immunoglobulins in pediatric AML cases needs to be further evaluated to assess whether it can reduce infection-related morbidity.","title":"Correlation of serum immunoglobulins with infection-related parameters during induction chemotherapy of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia: a prospective study.","pubmedId":"25250972"}
