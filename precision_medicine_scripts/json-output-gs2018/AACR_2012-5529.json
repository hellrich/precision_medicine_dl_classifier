In this study, we compared fluorescence-guided and standard bright-light resection. U87-RFP human glioma cells (2 x 105) were injected stereotactically into the nude mouse brain through a craniotomy open window. Two weeks after tumor-cell inoculation, brain tumors were resected under fluorescence guidance or under bright light. U87-RFP tumors were clearly visualized under fluorescent microscopy with long working distance at the single cell level. Almost all cancer cells were removed using fluorescence-guided navigation without damage to the brain tissue. However, brain tumors were difficult to visualize under bright light and many residual cancer cells remained in the brain after surgery. These results suggest that fluorescence-guided surgery has significant potential for treatment of brain cancer.","title":"Fluorescence-guided navigation surgery for resection of human glioma in an orthotopic model in nude mice","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5529"}
