Similar results were obtained in the transplanted B16 melanoma tumor model. Agmatine (1-1000 micromol/L) was able to attenuate the proliferation of cultured MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner and the highest inhibitory ratio reached 50.3% in the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Additionally, in the LDH release assay, spermine (20 micromol/L) and spermidine (20 micromol/L) increased the LDH release significantly, but agmatine (1-1000 micromol/L) did not, indicating that the inhibitory effect of agmatine on the proliferation of MCF was not related to cellular toxicity. In the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, putrescine (12.5-100.0 micromol/L) could reverse the inhibitory effect of agmatine on the proliferation of MCF concentration-dependently, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of agmatine on the proliferation of MCF might be associated with a decreased level of the intracellular polyamines pool.\nAgmatine had significant inhibitory effect on transplanted tumor growth in vivo and proliferation of tumor cells in vitro, and the mechanism might be a result of inducing decrease of intracellular polyamine contents.","title":"Inhibitory effect of agmatine on proliferation of tumor cells by modulation of polyamine metabolism.","pubmedId":"15842783"}
