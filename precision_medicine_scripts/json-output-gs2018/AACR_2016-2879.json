Although there is significant variability between patients, in response to RAI treatment, the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is unknown. PIGU is an endoplasmic reticulum protein and a component of the GPIT complex, which plays a crucial role in post-translational modification of proteins such as sodium iodide symporter (NIS). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly lower expression of PIGU in papillary carcinomas compared to matched normal thyroid tissue (P\u003c0.001). To study the role of PIGU in RAI uptake of differentiated thyroid cancer, we stably expressed PIGU and mock plasmid in the papillary cancer cell line (K1-PIGU and K1, respectively). Immunofluorescence analysis showed a significant increase in perinuclear expression of PIGU in the K1-PIGU cancer cells compared to controls. Similarly, flow cytometry analysis showed a significant increase in membranous expression of NIS in PIGU transfected cancer cells compared to controls. There were no significant differences in proliferation, invasion or motility between K1-PIGU and K1 cell lines. PIGU expression significantly increased I125 uptake compared to controls both in vitro (1.13 and 1030 ppm, respectively, p\u003c .001) and in vivo (153 and 1.2105 ppm, respectively, p\u003c .001). Mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition showed clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine. To address the mechanism underlying PIGU down regulation in RAI resistant tumors, we treated K1 and KI-PIGU cells with U0126 MEK inhibitor. This inhibition resulted in a significant increase in PIGU expression and I125 uptake in vitro. Taken together, our results revealed a pivotal role for PIGU in RAI sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells, by modulation of NIS expression.","title":"PIGU modulates radioactive iodine uptake in differentiated thyroid cancers","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2879"}
