Cellular exposure to genotoxic stress triggers the stabilization of p53 by multiple pathways that converge upon interference with MDM2 function. In this study, we first investigated the ability of HDM2 (MDM2 human homologue) to degrade endogenous p53 in neuroblastoma (NB). Although the p53 protein in NB has been reported to be constitutively stabilized, we find that HDM2 in NB is functional and facilitates the rapid turnover of p53 in nonstressed cells via the proteasome pathway. Second, we examined the relationship between p53 and HDM2 in the adriamycin-mediated stabilization of p53 in NB. We demonstrate that while p53 stabilization depends neither upon the phosphorylation of specific N-terminal sites nor upon dissociation from HDM2, it requires inactivation of functional HDM2. In support of this notion, p53 stabilization following adriamycin resulted in an inhibition of both p53 ubiquitination and HDM2 ligase activity. Taken together, these data implicate a requirement for enzymatic inactivation of HDM2 as a novel mechanism for p53 stabilization in the DNA damage response pathway.","title":"Requirement for HDM2 activity in the rapid degradation of p53 in neuroblastoma.","pubmedId":"11279110"}
