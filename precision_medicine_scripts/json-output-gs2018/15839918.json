Sections were first stained with the commercially available breast cancer test kit (HercepTest, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Parallel sections were then stained with a modified HercepTest procedure. Two different evaluation criteria were compared; the HercepTest score that requires \u003e or \u003d 10% stained tumour cells (as for breast cancer) and a proposed \u0027Target score\u0027 that requires \u003e 67% stained tumour cells. The latter score is assumed to be preferable for HER2-targeted radionuclide therapy.\nUsing the HercepTest kit, the Target score gave lower fractions of positive primary tumours and metastases than the HercepTest score. The modified HercepTest staining procedure and Target score gave high HER2 values in 80% of primary tumours and 62% of metastases, which is considerably more than that obtained with the HercepTest staining and score. There was a significant decrease in HER2 positivity with increasing distance from the primary tumour. In nine sentinel-node metastases assessed, all but one were HER2-positive. Considering all regional metastases, 74% were positive, and of distant metastases, 47%; 72% of the patients with positive primary tumours also expressed HER2 in their metastases.\nWhen combining the modified HercepTest with customised evaluation criteria, more HER2-positive tumours were diagnosed. The degree of HER2 down-regulation was significantly higher in distant than in regional metastases. HER2-targeted therapy may be an alternative or complementary to other methods in the future treatment of metastatic urinary bladder carcinoma.","title":"Analysis of HER2 expression in primary urinary bladder carcinoma and corresponding metastases.","pubmedId":"15839918"}
