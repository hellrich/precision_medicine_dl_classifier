To detect the expression of cysteine proteinase (Caspase 3 and Caspase 8) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in SACC-2 cells, immunohistochemistry staining was used.\nAccording the results of CCK-8 kit detected, salidroside could inhibit the proliferation of SACC-2 cells, IC50 value was (4.99+/-0.23) microg/mL. Growing curve showed that SACC-2 cells of salidroside groups decreased with extending cell culture time. Immunohistochemistry staining showed that Caspase 3 and Caspase 8 were both strong positive expression in SACC-2 cells of salidroside groups, and poor positive expression in SACC-2 cells of control group, the difference was significant (P\u003c0.01). The expression of PCNA was reverse (P\u003c0.01).\nSalidroside could inhibit the proliferation of SACC-2 cells and induce SACC-2 cell apoptosis in vitro, which could be a kind of antitumor medicine in the future.","title":"[Effect of salidroside on salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells in vitro].","pubmedId":"18705520"}
