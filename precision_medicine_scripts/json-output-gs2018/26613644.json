Melanomas with the BRAF(V) (600E) mutation grew significantly faster than melanomas without the mutation (mean 3·36 vs. 1·60 mm(2) /year, P \u003d 0·018). This effect of the BRAF(V) (600E) mutation on the growth rate was not observed in melanocytic naevi (mean 1·01 vs. 0·47 mm(2) /year, P \u003d 0·274). Histopathologically, extensive nesting, larger nests and larger cell sizes were more common in melanocytic neoplasms with the BRAF(V) (600E) mutation than in those without the mutation. Melanomas expressing p16 had a slower growth rate than melanomas without p16 expression (2·27 vs. 4·34 mm(2) /year, P \u003d 0·047). This effect was not observed in naevi (0·81 vs. 0·68 mm(2) /year, P \u003d 0·836).\nThe expression of BRAF(V) (600E) and the loss of p16 accelerate the growth rate of early melanomas in vivo but not in melanocytic naevi. In comparison to melanocytic proliferations that lack the mutation, the epidermal melanocytes in lesions that harbour BRAF(V) (600E) mutations are larger and more frequently arranged in large nests.","title":"Impact of oncogenic BRAF mutations and p16 expression on the growth rate of early melanomas and naevi in vivo.","pubmedId":"26613644"}
