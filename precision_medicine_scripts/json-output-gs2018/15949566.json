The presence of e1a2 BCR-ABL1 genomic rearrangement was seen in 2 different clones, one with the rearrangement and another one with the rearrangement and deletion of the BCR gene of the non-rearranged chromosome 22. After treatment with imatinib, the p210 transcript could not be detected, whereas p190 was still present 6 months after initiation of imatinib therapy and progression to blast phase. The absence of p210 transcript post treatment indicates that the clone with b3a2 responded to imatinib and that the observed resistance was associated to cells harboring the e1a2 genomic rearrangement. Despite resistance of this patient to imatinib, no evidence of mutations in the kinase domain of ABL1 was found. Loss of normal BCR in one cell clone may contribute to the resistance to imatinib due to the lack of BCR mediated inhibition of BCR-ABL1.","title":"Coexistence of different clonal populations harboring the b3a2 (p210) and e1a2 (p190) BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts in chronic myelogenous leukemia resistant to imatinib.","pubmedId":"15949566"}
