We recently demonstrated that through up-regulation of TNFalpha, ATF2 increases the resistance of late stage melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by UV-irradiation. In elucidating the role of ATF2 kinases, we now demonstrate that ASK1/MKK6/p38 elicits suppression of Fas expression. ASK1/p38 downregulates the expression of a Fas via NF-kappaB/SP1 site on the Fas promoter. Deletion or mutation of NF-kappaB/SP1 within the Fas promoter abrogates p38 effect. ASK1/p38 silences the Fas promoter by inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation - thereby limiting NF-kappaB activity. Forced expression of a dominant negative form of p38 (p38-ASP) or treatment with p38 pharmacological inhibitor, SB203580, increases NF-kappaB activity, Fas expression and the levels of UVC-induced apoptosis in late stage melanoma cells. Inhibition of p38 activity also restored NF-kappaB activity and Fas expression in early-phase melanoma cells, suggesting that p38 elicited suppression of Fas expression is not restricted to late phase melanoma. Identifying p38-mediated down-regulation of Fas expression illustrates a novel regulatory pathway by which ASK1/MKK6/p38 alters the degree and nature of the UV-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells.
