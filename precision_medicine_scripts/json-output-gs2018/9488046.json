The 68 kDa TRK-T3 fusion oncoprotein displays a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity resulting in its capability to transform mouse NIH3T3 cells. The TFG portion of TRK-T3 contains a coiled-coil domain most likely responsible for the constitutive, ligand-independent activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity. We have previously shown that TRK-T3 oncoprotein forms, in vivo, complexes of three or four molecules. By mean of different experimental approaches, we show here that TRK-T3 activity depends on oligomers formation. In addition, the analysis of different TRK-T3 mutants indicates that the TFG coiled-coil domain and its N-terminal region are both required for the activation and the fully transforming activity of the TRK-T3 oncoprotein, although, most likely, they play a role in different steps of the transforming process. The deletion of the coiled-coil domain abrogates the oligomers formation leading to a constitutive activation; the deletion of the N-terminal region, although not affecting phosphorylation and complexes formation, abrogates transformation, thus suggesting a role in cellular localization and/or interaction with substrata.","title":"Role of the TFG N-terminus and coiled-coil domain in the transforming activity of the thyroid TRK-T3 oncogene.","pubmedId":"9488046"}
