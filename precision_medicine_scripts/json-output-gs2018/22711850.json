The associations of clinical and pathologic factors with SLN status, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) were analyzed.\nThe majority of patients had either no (TIL grade 0; 35.4%) or few (TIL grade 1; 45.1%) TILs, with a minority showing moderate (TIL grade 2; 16.3%) or marked (TIL grade 3; 3.2%) TILs. Tumor thickness, mitotic rate, and Clark level were inversely correlated with TIL grade (each P \u003c .001). SLN biopsy was performed in 1,138 patients (61.0%) and was positive in 252 (22.1%). There was a significant inverse association between SLN status and TIL grade (SLN positivity rates for each TIL grade: 0, 27.8%; 1, 20.1%; 2, 18.3%; 3, 5.6%; P \u003c .001). Predictors of SLN positivity were decreasing age (P \u003c .001), decreasing TIL grade (P \u003c .001), ulceration (P \u003d .003), increasing tumor thickness (P \u003d .01), satellitosis (P \u003d .03), and increasing mitoses (P \u003d .03). The 5-year MSS and RFS rates were 83% and 76%, respectively (median follow-up, 43 months). Tumor thickness (P \u003c .001), ulceration (P \u003c .001), satellitosis (P \u003c .001), mitotic rate (P \u003d .003), TIL grade (P \u003c .001), and sex (P \u003d .01) were independent predictors of MSS. Patients with TIL grade 3 tumors had 100% survival.\nTIL grade is an independent predictor of survival and SLN status in patients with melanoma. Patients with a pronounced TIL infiltrate have an excellent prognosis.","title":"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte grade is an independent predictor of sentinel lymph node status and survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"22711850"}
