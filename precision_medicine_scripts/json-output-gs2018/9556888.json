Colonoscopy after resection of colorectal cancer offers the possibility of direct inspection and to take biopsies for the early detection of local recurrence or additional neoplasms. In a retrospective study we examined the benefit of regular colonoscopies. Between 1/1995 and 4/1996 237 colonoscopies were performed on 164 patients after resection of colorectal cancer. The evaluation was done due to the stage of the primary tumor, the age of the patients, the time after operation and the number of previous colonoscopies. 54 adenomas were found in 35 of 164 patients. 32% of the adenomas were diagnosed in the ascending colon or colon transversum. Additionally three carcinomas were found. There were two local recurrences and one metachronous neoplasm. Two patients were diagnosed without clinical symptoms and were able to undergo potential curative resection again. Because of the number and the localisation of diagnosed neoplasms colonoscopic surveillance should be performed every six months in the first two years after resection of colorectal cancer.","title":"[Value of colonoscopy in tumor after-care after colorectal carcinoma].","pubmedId":"9556888"}
