A modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (mCCI) at baseline was registered. Change in systolic and diastolic BP (DBP) and pulse pressure (PP) from 2002 onwards was calculated. The relation between kidney function evolution and baseline BP and change in BP was examined using linear and logistic regression analysis.\nThe slope of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, MDRD, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) was calculated by the ordinal least square method. A rapid annual decline of kidney function was defined as ≥ 3 L/min/1.73 m(2)/year.\nRapid annual decline of kidney function occurred in 1130 patients (13.1%). High baseline systolic BP (SBP) and PP predicted kidney function decline in participants aged 60-79 years. No correlation between baseline BP and kidney function decline was found in participants aged 80 years and older. An annual decline of ≥ 1 mm Hg in SBP and PP was a strong risk factor for a rapid annual kidney function decline in all age strata, independent of baseline BP and mCCI. A decline in DBP as also a strong independent predictor in participants aged 60-79 years.\nThe present study identified a decline in BP over time as a strong risk factor for kidney function decline in all age strata, adjusted for mCCI and baseline kidney function and BP.","title":"The correlation between blood pressure and kidney function decline in older people: a registry-based cohort study.","pubmedId":"26129635"}
