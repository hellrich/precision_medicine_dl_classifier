Patients were regularly assessed by radiological and fiberoptic bronchoscopy examinations in order to evaluate local control. An objective response was observed in 22 patients (29%) after initial chemotherapy (2 complete remissions and 20 partial responses). The complete response rate after the combined schedule was 30%. Toxicity of this combination was acceptable. Median survival was 13.5 months. Actuarial risk of developing distant metastases at 3 years was 60%. However, the main cause of failure was local with 80% of uncontrolled or recurrent thoracic tumor in the first 2 years of follow-up. The present study shows that local control remains a major problem in the management of patients with inoperable non metastatic non small cell lung cancer.","title":"[Combination of chemotherapy (vindesine, lomustine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide) and thoracic radiotherapy in nonresectable non-small cell bronchial carcinoma: final results of a phase II clinical trial].","pubmedId":"1334740"}
