The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \"The common feature of leukemia-associated IDH1 and IDH2 mutations is a neomorphic enzyme activity converting alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate\" by Ward and colleagues, published in Cancer Cell in 2010 (Ward et al., 2010). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 2, 3 and 5. Ward and colleagues demonstrate the mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), abrogate the enzyme\u0027s wild-type activity and confer to the mutant neomorphic activity that produces the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (Figures 2 and 3). They then show that elevated levels of 2-HG are correlated with mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 in AML patient samples (Figure 5). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published by eLife.
