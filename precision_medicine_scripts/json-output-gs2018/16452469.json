By contrast, activating mutations in B-RAF are rare in ocular melanoma. This study aimed to determine the role of wild-type B-Raf ((WT)B-Raf) in uveal melanoma cell growth. We used cell lines derived from primary tumors of uveal melanoma to assess the role of (WT)B-Raf in cell proliferation and to characterize its upstream regulators and downstream effectors. Melanoma cell lines expressing (WT)B-Raf and (WT)Ras grew with similar proliferation rates, showed constitutive activation of ERK1/2, and had similar levels of B-Raf expression and B-Raf kinase activity as melanoma cell lines expressing the activating V600E mutation ((V600E)B-Raf). They were equally as sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2 for cell proliferation and transformation as (V600E)B-Raf cells. siRNA-mediated depletion of Raf-1 did not affect either ERK1/2 activation, whereas siRNA-mediated depletion of B-Raf reduced cell proliferation by up to 65% through the inhibition of ERK1/2 activation, irrespective of the mutational status of B-Raf. Pharmacological inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and siRNA-mediated depletion of PKA greatly reduced B-Raf activity, ERK1/2 activation, and cell proliferation in (WT)B-Raf cells, whereas it did not affect (V600E)B-Raf cells, demonstrating a key role of PKA in mediating (WT)B-Raf/ERK signaling for uveal melanoma cell growth. Moreover, inactivation or depletion of PKA did not affect Rap-1 activity, and Rap-1 depletion did not affect either B-Raf activity or ERK1/2 activation. This ruled out a role for Rap1 in the PKA-mediated B-Raf/ERK activation in (WT)B-Raf cells. Finally, we demonstrated the importance of cyclin D1 in mediating PKA/(WT)B-Raf signaling for cell proliferation. Altogether, our results suggest that the PKA/B-Raf pathway is a potential target for therapeutic strategies against (WT)B-Raf-expressing uveal melanoma.","title":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent proliferation is mediated through the protein kinase A/B-Raf pathway in human uveal melanoma cells.","pubmedId":"16452469"}
