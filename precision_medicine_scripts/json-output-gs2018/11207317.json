One such Ag, MART-1, is expressed on \u003e90% of human melanomas, and CTL generated against MART-1(27-35) kill most HLA A2.1(+) melanoma cells. However, variant tumor cells, which do not express MART-1, down-regulate MHC, or become resistant to apoptosis, will escape killing. Cytotoxic lymphocytes kill by two main mechanisms, the perforin/granzyme degranulation pathway and the TNF/Fas/TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand superfamily of apoptosis-inducing ligands. In this study, we examined whether cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (II) cisplatin (CDDP) sensitizes MART-1/HLA A2.1(+) melanoma and melanoma variant tumor cells to non-MHC-restricted, Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated killing by CTL. MART-1(27-35)-specific bulk CTL cultures were generated by pulsing normal PBL with MART-1(27-35) peptide. These CTL cultures specifically kill M202 melanoma cells (MART-1(+), HLA A2.1(+), FasR(-)), and MART-1(27-35) peptide-pulsed T2 cells (FasR(+)), but not M207 melanoma cells (MART-1(+), HLA A2.1(-), FasR(-)), FLU(58-66) peptide-pulsed T2 cells, or DU145 and PC-3 prostate cells (MART-1(-), HLA A2.1(-), FasR(+)). CDDP (0.1-10 microg/ml) sensitized non-MART-1(27-35) peptide-pulsed T2 to the CD8(+) subset of bulk MART-1-specific CTL, and killing was abolished by neutralizing anti-Fas Ab. Furthermore, CDDP up-regulated FasR expression and FasL-mediated killing of M202, and sensitized PC-3 and DU145 to killing by bulk MART-1-specific CTL cultures. These findings demonstrate that drug-mediated sensitization can potentiate FasL-mediated killing by MHC-restricted CTL cell lines, independent of MHC and MART-1 expression on tumor cells. This represents a novel approach for potentially controlling tumor cell variants found in primary heterogeneous melanoma tumor cell populations that would normally escape killing by MART-1-specific immunotherapy.","title":"Immunosensitization of melanoma tumor cells to non-MHC Fas-mediated killing by MART-1-specific CTL cultures.","pubmedId":"11207317"}
