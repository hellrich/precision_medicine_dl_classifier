One such marker, MIB1, an antibody immunoreactive throughout the cell cycle, is predictive of more aggressive disease and poorer prognosis in astrocytomas. An independent role of MIB1 analysis for survival prediction and clinical management within histologic grades has not been clearly proven.\nThis study retrospectively evaluated MIB1 reactivity in tissue samples from 116 patients with glioblastomas on initial medical presentation. Clinical variables considered included gender, age, Karnofsky Performance Scores (KPS), extent of surgical resection, adjuvant radiation and survival.\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses were used to correlate these variables with MIB1 staining. MIB1 staining does not predict overall survival or response to adjuvant therapy as an independent risk factor.\nMIB1 labeling does not predict patient survival as an independent variable and does not predict response to additional therapies. Patient survival with glioblastoma was predicted by KPS, age, extent of resection and use of adjuvant radiotherapy.","title":"Role of MIB1 in predicting survival in patients with glioblastomas.","pubmedId":"16234986"}
