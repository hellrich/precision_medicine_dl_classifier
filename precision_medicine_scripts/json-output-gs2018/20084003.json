A critical update of recent publications on this topic is presented.\nThus far, some potentially interesting predictive gene profiles (consisting of 4-825 genes) have been described. The studies have focused on predicting survival, the development of lymph node metastases and the occurrence of distant metastases. The overlap of genes between studies was limited, probably related to differences in platforms, tumor subtypes and analytical methods. Validation of the profiles was suboptimal.\nMicro-array expression profiling has no clinical benefit for the head and neck cancer patient at this moment. Clinical implementation will depend on the outcome of studies that focus on the proper validation of the proposed profiles in large uniform patient groups and on the translation of the findings into a cost-effective and easy-to-use assay for everyday practice.","title":"Gene expression profiling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20084003"}
