Few data are available regarding quantification of their levels of expression in gynecologic malignancies.\nEpidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor specific binding capacities and affinities were measured by ligand binding assay using [125I]EGF in a competition mode with Accufit software (Lundon Software, Inc., Middlefield, OH). HER-2/neu oncoprotein was extracted from membranes and measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cathepsin D was measured by an immunoradiometric assay using cytosols for steroid receptor analyses.\nEGF receptors in 23 nonmalignant uteri ranged from undetectable to 50 fmol/mg membrane protein (median, 0), with dissociation constant values of 1.2 x 10(-9) M to 8.5 x 10(-10) M, compared with EGF receptors in 76 endometrial cancers that ranged from undetectable to 7674 fmol/mg (median, 52). HER-2/neu oncoprotein ranged from undetectable to 2.9 HER-2/neu units (HNU)/microg protein (median, 0.6) in 41 nonmalignant uteri and from undetectable to 5.8 HNU/microg protein (median, 2.5) in endometrial cancers (n \u003d 53). Cathepsin D ranged from 5 to 32 pmol/mg cytosol protein (median, 11) in 42 nonmalignant uteri and 18 to 144 pmol/mg protein (median, 42) in 29 endometrial cancers.\nDetermination of the frequency and levels of EGF receptors, HER-2/neu protein, and cathepsin D in uteri with and without cancer and the availability of reference materials developed in our laboratory, will allow evaluation of their prognostic value in cancers of the uterus.","title":"Quantitative analyses of epidermal growth factor receptors, HER-2/neu oncoprotein and cathepsin D in nonmalignant and malignant uteri.","pubmedId":"8616763"}
