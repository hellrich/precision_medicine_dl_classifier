Due to its aggressive behavior, high capacity of recurrence and the great ability to metastasize, a careful clinical long-term monitoring is required. We report a new case of a 20 years old girl, presented with proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma in her right scapular region, confirmed by pathological examination and removed surgically without recurrence or metastasis at eighteen months of follow-up.","title":"Proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma: a new case report and literature review.","pubmedId":"27800093"}
