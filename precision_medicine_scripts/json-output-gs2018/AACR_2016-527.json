We could previously show that hyper-activation of the PI3K signaling cascade by genetic knock-out of the counteracting phosphatase PTEN induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype in myeloid cells. This resulted in protection of conditional knock-out mice in models of acute infection and inflammation.A reduction in pro-inflammatory responses could however increase tumor burden. To address this question we induced colitis associated colon cancer in conditional PTEN-KO mice and found an increase in tumor burden and a reduction in survival in male KO mice. This was accompanied by increased numbers of splenic antigen-presenting cells (APC) expressing the immune checkpoint regulators PD-L1 and PD-L2. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis in these cells revealed a shift towards gene expression profiles found in professional APCs capable of cross-presentation. As expected, ex-vivo stimulated T-cells from KO-mice showed a reduction in proliferative capacity. These findings were further substantiated by findings in a second tumor model using implanted B16 melanoma cells. In this model myeloid PTEN-deficient mice showed a decrease in T-cell activation and a reduction in melanoma cell killing capacity.Taken together, our findings show that genetic deletion of PTEN in cells of myeloid origin increases splenic APCs expressing immune checkpoint regulators resulting in a decrease in tumor immune surveillance. Our study shows that PI3K-inhibitors which are currently tested as anti-cancer drugs might have additional beneficial effects on immune cells by shifting their inflammatory phenotype.","title":"Myeloid PTEN deficiency impairs tumor immune surveillance via immune checkpoint inhibition","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-527"}
