The effect of the concurrent presence of Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis and papillary thyroid carcinoma remains controversial.\nTo evaluate the association between Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis and clinicopathological parameters in thyroid papillary carcinoma cases, based on an historical institutional cohort analysis.\nCross-sectional study obtained from a historical cohort, including all cases submitted to thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma in a single institution during an 11-year period study.\nA total of 417 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma were enrolled; 148 (35.4%) also had Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis. A female predominance among cases associated to Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis was observed. The thyroid tumor, in cases associated with Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis, had a smaller mean diameter, lower frequency of extra-thyroid extension, and earlier clinicopathological staging.\nA high proportion of papillary thyroid carcinoma cases are associated with Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis. There are associations among these cases with several histopathological factors already recognized for their prognostic value, which by themselves could impact outcomes.","title":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma: does the association with Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis affect the clinicopathological characteristics of the disease?","pubmedId":"25458258"}
