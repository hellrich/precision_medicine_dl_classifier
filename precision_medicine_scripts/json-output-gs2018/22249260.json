Aberrant ALK fusion proteins were also generated in inflammatory fibrosarcoma and a subset of non-small-cell lung cancers, and these proteins are implicated in their pathogenesis. Recently, ALK has been demonstrated to be constitutively activated by gene mutations and/or amplifications in sporadic as well as familial cases of neuroblastoma. Here we describe another mechanism of aberrant ALK activation observed in a neuroblastoma-derived cell line (NB-1), in which a short-form ALK protein (ALK(del2-3)) having a truncated extracellular domain is overexpressed because of amplification of an abnormal ALK gene that lacks exons 2 and 3. ALK(del2-3) was autophosphorylated in NB-1 cells as well as in ALK(del2-3)-transduced cells and exhibited enhanced in vitro kinase activity compared with the wild-type kinase. ALK(del2-3)-transduced NIH3T3 cells exhibited increased colony-forming capacity in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice. RNAi-mediated ALK knockdown resulted in the growth suppression of ALK(del2-3)-expressing cells, arguing for the oncogenic role of this mutant. Our findings provide a novel insight into the mechanism of deregulation of the ALK kinase and its roles in neuroblastoma pathogenesis.","title":"Aberrant activation of ALK kinase by a novel truncated form ALK protein in neuroblastoma.","pubmedId":"22249260"}
