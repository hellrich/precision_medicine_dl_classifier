In the present study, the antiproliferative effect of the new oncogenic B-Raf targeting drug UI-152 on two types of melanoma cell lines with differing B-Raf mutational status was examined, and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. In cellular assays, UI-152 displayed high selectivity for tumor cells bearing B-Raf(V600E), showing more than 1000-fold higher inhibition of their proliferation than wild-type B-Raf-bearing cells. As expected, UI-152 completely abolished MEK-ERK phosphorylation in A375P cells harboring B-Raf(V600E). In SK-MEL-2 cells expressing B-Raf(WT), UI-152 caused the paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway but to a much lesser extent than that observed of other oncogenic B-Raf inhibitors. These data suggest that UI-152 may be a more ideal B-Raf inhibitor capable of preserving potency against oncogenic B-Raf while minimizing the paradoxical activation of MAPK signaling. In addition, we showed that UI-152 treatment of A375P cells simultaneously induced cellular autophagy and apoptosis. However, autophagy inhibition with 3-methyladenine and inhibition of apoptosis by overexpression of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis failed to rescue melanoma cells from UI-152-induced cell death, implying that apoptosis and autophagy may cooperate in the induction of cell death in UI-152-treated cells. Collectively, our data suggest that UI-152 may be an effective B-Raf inhibitor and a potential therapeutic strategy for B-Raf(WT) and Ras mutant melanoma.","title":"Differential sensitivity of melanoma cell lines with differing B-Raf mutational status to the new oncogenic B-Raf kinase inhibitor UI-152.","pubmedId":"22425959"}
