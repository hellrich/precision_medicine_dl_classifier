Tumour cells with internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the FLT3 receptor gene were significantly more sensitive to the FLT3 inhibitor SU5614 than tumour cells with wild type FLT3. Combinations of SU5614 with etoposide and amsacrine showed better effect (p\u003c0.05) compared with the respective single drugs. Our results suggest that the FLT3 inhibitor SU5614 may have a therapeutic potential, especially in combination with other cytotoxic agents, in patients with FLT3-ITD positive AML.","title":"In vitro activity of the flt3-inhibitor su5614 and standard cytotoxic agents in tumour cells from patients with wild type and mutated flt3 acute myeloid leukaemia.","pubmedId":"16038735"}
