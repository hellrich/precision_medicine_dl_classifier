Some rare clinical situations (young age at diagnosis, bilateral or multifocal forms, association with cutaneous malignant melanoma and/or familial aggregations of melanomas) are suggestive of genetic susceptibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of CDKN2A/P16INK4A, P14ARF and CDK4 gene germline mutations in a series of patients with uveal melanoma recruited in a single institution with a clinical presentation indicative of genetic predisposition. Molecular analyses were proposed to 36 patients and were performed in 25 cases. The contribution of BRCA1/2 gene germline mutations in patients with uveal melanoma and a personal and/or family history of breast/ovarian cancers was also evaluated. Molecular analysis of BRCA1/2 genes was proposed to 35 patients and was performed in 25 patients. No deleterious germline mutation was identified in either group of patients. These results indicate that the CDKN2A/P16INK4A, P14ARF, CDK4 genes are not responsible for the vast majority of genetic susceptibility to uveal melanoma. They also suggest that one case of uveal melanoma in a family with a history of breast cancer is not sufficient to justify BRCA1/2 genetic testing when the classical criteria for molecular analysis are not present. International studies are ongoing in melanoma-prone families in an attempt to identify uveal melanoma susceptibility loci and genes.","title":"Contribution of CDKN2A/P16 ( INK4A ), P14 (ARF), CDK4 and BRCA1/2 germline mutations in individuals with suspected genetic predisposition to uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"20842456"}
