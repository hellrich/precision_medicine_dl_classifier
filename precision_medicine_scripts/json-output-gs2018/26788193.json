The expression levels of EGFR and VEGFR-2 from 119 pairs of esophageal carcinoma tissue and corresponding pericarcinoma tissue from Uygur, Han and Kazak patients with esophageal carcinoma were detected by immunohistochemistry following surgical resection, and an additional five carcinoma in situ specimens were also tested. The relative expression was analyzed among the ethnic groups and clinicopathological parameters. The positive rate of EGFR in esophageal carcinoma tissue from patients of Uygur, Han and Kazak heritage was 70.73, 68.42 and 67.5%, respectively. For VEGFR-2 the positive rate was 73.17, 68.42 and 67.5%, respectively. No significant difference was detected in their expression between the three ethnic groups (P\u003e0.05); however, EGFR and VEGFR-2 overexpression were correlated with lymph node metastasis (P\u003c0.05). VEGF expression was also correlated with the expression of VEGFR-2 in esophageal carcinoma tissues. EGFR was positive in carcinoma in situ samples, while VEGFR-2 was negative. The overexpression of EGFR is therefore an early event and may have a significant role in the progression of esophageal carcinoma pathogenesis. EGFR overexpression may correlate with the expression of VEGFR-2 in esophageal cancer. These results may aid the early diagnosis of esophageal cancer, and the development of individual target treatment in the future.","title":"Characterization of the expression and clinical features of epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 in esophageal carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26788193"}
