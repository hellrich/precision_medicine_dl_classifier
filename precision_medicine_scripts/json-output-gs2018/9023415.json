Six HLA class I-restricted and tumor-specific CTL lines were established: (i) HLA A2-restricted and adenocarcinoma-specific CTLs in three (two A0201+ and one A0206+) patients with adenocarcinoma, (ii) HLA A3101- and A3302-restricted and adenocarcinoma-specific CTLs in an HLA A3101/3302+ patient with adenocarcinoma, and (iii) HLA A3302-restricted CTLs and (iv) HLA A2402-restricted CTLs recognizing tumors with different types of histology in an HLA A3302+ patient with adenocarcinoma and an HLA A2402+ patient with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), respectively. The three HLA A2-restricted CTL lines recognized 4, 4, or 6 of 15 HLA A2+ adenocarcinoma cell lines that originated from lung, stomach, colon, and breast with different subtypes (HLA A0201, A0206, and A0207), respectively. Furthermore, the CTLs of an HLA A0206+ patient recognized five different fractions of peptides eluted from an HLA A0201+ adenocarcinoma cell line. These results showed evidence of the existence of HLA class I-restricted and tumor-specific CTLs recognizing peptide antigens on HLA-A alleles of adenocarcinoma or SCC in tumor sites of a substantial number of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","title":"HLA-A locus-restricted and tumor-specific CTLs in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"9023415"}
