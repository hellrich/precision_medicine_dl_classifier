Translocations involving the NTRK1/2/3 kinase domain, mutations involving the TRK ligand-binding site, and amplifications of NTRK, have been described in diverse tumor types and may contribute to tumorigenesis. A broad range of pediatric malignancies have been found to harbor NTRK fusions, including infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS), spindle-cell sarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, pediatric papillary thyroid cancer, pediatric gliomas and Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Larotrectinib is the first small-molecule selective inhibitor of TRKA, -B, and -C in clinical development and preliminary data from the adult phase 1 trial demonstrate prolonged responses in patients with TRK fusions and a favorable safety profile. Methods: We have initiated an open-label, multi-center, international Phase 1/2 study with larotrectinib in pediatric patients with solid tumors and primary CNS tumors (NCT02637687). Patients with advanced cancer between the ages of 1 year and 21 years are eligible, as well as patients as young as 1-month of age with a documented NTRK fusion. Patients with IFS who have not had definitive surgery are also eligible. Larotrectinib is administered orally twice daily on a continuous 28-day schedule. Dosing is based on body surface area. Larotrectinib is available in an oral liquid formulation and capsules. Following identification of the maximum tolerated dose of larotrectinib in the phase 1 portion, the phase 2 portion will commence. The phase 2 portion will enroll patients with NTRK-translocated tumors and measurable disease into three cohorts: 1) infantile fibrosarcoma; 2) extracranial solid tumors; and 3) primary CNS tumors. The primary endpoint for the phase 2 portion is objective response rate, with duration of response and progression free survival as secondary efficacy endpoints. Each phase 2 cohort will enroll in a single stage of up to 10 patients per cohort. Molecular abnormalities will be characterized through the analysis of archival tissue. Enrollment began in December 2015 and is ongoing.
