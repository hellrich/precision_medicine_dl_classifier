While the worldwide incidence rate of melanoma has increased during the last decade, current therapies for melanoma do not provide long-term effect. The highly heterogeneous expression signature of melanoma underlies the inefficient therapy and accentuates the inevitability of profound molecular understanding of melanoma, its maintenance and progression. In this study, we aimed to reveal the complex patterns of distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the progression and maintenance of melanoma using high-throughput sequencing technologies. Series of melanoma tumor tissues representing discrete stages of the malignant progression were deeply sequenced. Integrative analysis revealed hard-wired genomic aberrations and associated transcriptomic consequences. These genomic aberrations included clusters of oncogenes brought together by structural variations, which cooperated in their amplifications and subsequent up-regulated expressions. We believe that these hard-wired genetic changes are biologically significant; they sustain the survival of the tumor and offer the advantage of the distant metastasis. We reconstituted the architecture of melanoma progression and maintenance and we identified gene cassettes with a putative role in sustaining tumor growth. The correlation of these gene cassettes with the cancer phenotype and the feasibility of these putative oncogenes as candidates for targeted therapy were addressed using cell-based assays on a high content screening platform. Analysis of the matched cell lines derived from the same patient offered a valuable resource for in vitro manipulation, testing of drugs and functional validation. A detailed molecular characterization of the functionally validated genes and their contribution in the cancer signaling pathways will provide a better understanding of the molecular basis of tumor evolution.","title":"Genomic signatures of melanoma maintenance","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3414"}
