It inhibited the cancer metastasis by blocking epithelial-mesenchymal transition, however, litter studies focused on its role in other cancer processes. In this study, miR-497 expression was found inversely correlated with SMAD7 expression in breast cancer tissues. Bioinformatics analyses defined a potential miR-497 response element within 3\u0027 untranslated region of SMAD7 that was validated in reporter gene experiments. Enforced miR-497 expression, accompanied with SMAD7 reduction, suppressed MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth by MTT and invasion assay, and, induced the S phase arrest detected by flow cytometry. Furthermore, upregulated miR-497 expression by mimics treatment significantly suppressed the tumor growth in the orthotopic nude mouse models. Finally, high expression of miR-497 conferred a better prognosis, indicated by Kaplan-Meier test, especially in HER2 overexpression and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Taken together, our results identified the proliferation promoting role of SMAD7 in breast cancer and therefore established the regulations of SMAD7 in breast cancer by miR-497 through a posttranscriptional mechanism. Moreover, miR-497 might be deemed as a novel potential therapeutic target for the HER2 positive and TNBC in future.
