Eight-and-a-half year-old child with a history of a CNS tumor (choroid plexus carcinoma) and two years later, a melanoma (Spitz nevus).\nimpaired motor function of the left half of the body and pain upon ipsilateral gait. The physical exam showed swelling of the left iliac crest. The X-rays showed osteoblastic osteosarcoma and the fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was positive. The diagnosis was made according to the clinical criteria for LFS.\nWe report a case of LFS diagnosed based on clinical criteria. We suggest that the questioning of patients with cancer be aimed at finding out the family history of neoplasias. The case presented herein shows an evident association between both choroid plexus carcinoma and osteoblastic osteosarcoma and the patient\u0027s family history. We think that any physician treating children with cancer should consider these multiple familial cancer syndromes.","title":"[Li-Fraumeni familial cancer syndrome: case report and review of the literature].","pubmedId":"17695766"}
