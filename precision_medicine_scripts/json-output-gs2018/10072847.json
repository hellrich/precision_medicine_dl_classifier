(2) Increased expression of EGFR was found in the intestinal metaplastic and dysplastic areas compared with nomral mucosa and carcinoma tissue (P \u003c 0.01). (3) Coexpression rate of TGF-alpha and EGFR was higher in dysplasia than in other tissues (P \u003c 0.01). (4) There was a close correlation between the intensities of TGF-alpha, EGFR and PCNA. (5) The expression of TGF-alpha, EGFR and PCNA was not related to infiltration and lymph node metastasis of gastric carcinoma.\nThe increased expression of EGFR, TGF-alpha may serve as an important molecular marker of gastric premalignant lesions when combined with measurement of PCNA LI and may be of assistance in screening of early gastric carcinoma in high risk populations.","title":"[The correlation of TGF-alpha, EGFR in precancerous lesions and carcinoma of stomach with PCNA expression].","pubmedId":"10072847"}
