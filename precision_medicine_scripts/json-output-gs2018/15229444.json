For photodynamic therapy of superficial esophageal cancer, a transparent hood was used to obtain precise laser irradiation.\nThe transparent hood was attached to the tip of an upper endoscope. Forty-eight hours after the injection of porfimer sodium, cancerous lesions were irradiated with an excimer-dye laser (4 mJ, 80 Hz). Twenty-four hours later, additional irradiation was applied to lesions when the response to the initial irradiation appeared insufficient. Fifteen neoplastic lesions in 7 patients were treated.\nThe initial size of the lesions ranged from 5 to 30 mm in diameter. Histopathologically, there were 9 squamous-cell carcinomas and 6 high-grade squamous dysplastic lesions. All treated lesions disappeared after the first or the second laser irradiation (total energy range 39.1-193.5 J/cm(2)). During follow-up (range 4-51 months), there was no recurrence of the initial lesion in any patient. There was no severe photodynamic therapy related complication.\nPhotodynamic therapy with a transparent hood is an acceptable option for the treatment of superficial esophageal cancer.","title":"Photodynamic therapy of superficial esophageal cancer with a transparent hood.","pubmedId":"15229444"}
