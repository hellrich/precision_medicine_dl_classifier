Previous work has led to the view that the coagulation phenotype and the genetic defect are associated in almost all patients. It has been reported about single APC-resistant patients without associated factor V Leiden, but significance and thrombotic risk of this constellation have not yet been established.\nWe tested 486 consecutive patients with deep venous thrombosis, arterial disease or other than vascular disease for APC-resistance with a factor VIII based assay.\n149 patients (31%) showed a pathological APC-ratio. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of factor V Leiden were 100% and 40%, respectively. At 6 months follow-up APC-ratio returned to normal in 55% of the patients with initial pathological APC-resistance. At 12 months follow-up 91% of the patients with persistent APC-resistance showed a pathological ratio as well.\nPatients with APC-resistance not due to factor V Leiden can be attributed to one subset with reversible APC-resistance--possibly due to a hypercoagulable state in an acute thrombotic situation, and to another with persistent APC-resistance.","title":"Patients with persistent APC-resistance without factor V Leiden mutation.","pubmedId":"11284086"}
