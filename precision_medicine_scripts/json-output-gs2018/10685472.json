Opacities on the chest x-ray suggestive of lung cancer were observed in 5 of the 7 cases. All 7 had squamous cell carcinoma. The percentage of smokers was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary fibrosis who developed lung cancer than in those with fibrosis who did not develop lung cancer (p \u003d 0.016). These 7 cases of lung cancer with pulmonary fibrosis were compared with 174 cases of lung cancer without associated fibrosis. Peripheral localizations and lower lobe involvement were higher in cases of lung cancer with pulmonary fibrosis.","title":"[Diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and bronchial cancer].","pubmedId":"10685472"}
