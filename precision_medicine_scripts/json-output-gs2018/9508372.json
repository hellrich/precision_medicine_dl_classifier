To study whether the p53 mutational status affects chemosensitivity, we compared the responses to chemotherapy of four melanoma cell lines containing the wild-type p53 and four cell lines carrying the mutant p53. Cisplatin, at 10 microM, virtually killed all the cells in the wild-type p53 cell lines, while 57-95% of the cells in the mutant p53 cell lines survived (P \u003d 0.005). After treatment with 100 nM of vincristine, on average 18% of the wild-type p53 melanoma cells survived compared with 55% of the mutant p53 cells (P \u003d 0.04). After treatment with 40 nM, 200 nM or 1 microM of camptothecin the survival rates were, on average, 16%, 8% and 4% for the wild-type p53 melanoma cells, compared with 89%, 67% and 38% for the mutant p53 cells, respectively (P \u003d 0.00004, P \u003d 0.003 and P \u003d 0.04, respectively). The anticancer agents were not toxic to normal melanocytes at doses inducing cytotoxicity in wild-type p53 melanoma cells. The main mechanism of cytotoxicity appears to be drug-induced apoptosis. Cisplatin, camptothecin and vincristine all induced apoptosis in wild-type p53 melanoma cells, but not in mutant p53 cells. Our results suggest that chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells is p53 dependent, and mutation of the p53 gene is an indicator of drug resistance in melanoma.","title":"Chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells is p53 dependent.","pubmedId":"9508372"}
