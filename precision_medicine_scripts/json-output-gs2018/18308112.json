Clinical stage was T3a-c in 14 patients (64%), T2c in 4 (18%), T2b in 3 (14%), and T1c in 1 (4%). Presurgery characteristics after chemohormonal therapy were as follows: PSA value 0.21 (0.05 to 0.6) ng/mL, clinical stage T1c in 14 patients (63.7%), T2a in 6 (27.3%), and T3a in 2 (9%). The pathologic specimens revealed viable disease in all patients, organ-confined disease in 14 (63.6%), specimen-confined disease in 16 (72.7%), seminal vesicle disease in 9 (40.9%), and lymph node involvement in 4 (18.1%). To date, at a median follow-up of 23.6 (12.1 to 54.7) months, 10 patients (45.4%) relapsed, with PSA doubling time of 1.5 (0.4 to 34.3) months. Of the relapsed patients, 8 (89%) had organ/specimen involvement.\nThe neoadjuvant chemohormonal approach with nerve-preservation surgery is feasible in patients with poor-prognosis localized prostate cancer. It leads to clinical tumor downstaging. The pattern of relapse suggests that local therapy, with radiotherapy for patients with surgical or capsular involvement, and additional systemic therapy should be integrated.","title":"Neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy in poor-prognosis localized prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"18308112"}
