The 21% heritability in gastric cancer (GC) and the 30% heritability in colorectal (CRC), serve as evidence for the higher involvement of hereditary factors in CRC. These findings are in line with some literature data regarding CRC, but at the same time they emphasize the increased awareness of hereditary risk factors in GC as well.","title":"Epidemiologic research on the genetic risk factors in gastric and colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"15678856"}
