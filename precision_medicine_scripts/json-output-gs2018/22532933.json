Hepatic resection has been proposed as a therapeutic and potentially curative procedure in metastatic melanoma patients with isolated hepatic metastases.\nTo report two metastatic melanoma patients with isolated hepatic metastases treated with partial hepatectomy. In addition, the literature is reviewed and the management and efficacy of surgical excision for isolated hepatic disease in the setting of malignant melanoma is discussed.\nA 34-year-old woman with metastatic cutaneous melanoma and a 55-year-old man with metastatic ocular melanoma are presented. Both patients developed isolated hepatic metastases detected during routine surveillance following resection of their primary disease and underwent partial hepatectomy.\nIn select cases, partial hepatectomy is an efficacious and potentially curative treatment for metastatic melanoma patients with isolated hepatic metastases.","title":"Two cases of partial hepatectomy for malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"22532933"}
