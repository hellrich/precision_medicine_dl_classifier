However, the findings concerning the impact of PIK3CA mutations on BC are controversial. The aim of this study was to characterize the PIK3CA mutations in a cohort of 101 operable BC patients receiving systemic adjuvant therapy and to determine associations with pathological features and patient outcome.  Methods:  Mutations in the helical (E542K, E545K) and the kinase (H1047R, H1047L) domains of the PIK3CA gene were investigated by direct sequencing and Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) allele-specific PCR and Scorpion probes in FFPE tumor samples. The prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutations for disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) was evaluated in univariate and multivariate analysis adjusted for the type of surgery (breast-conserving vs mastectomy), adjuvant treatment administered, histological grading, tumor size, axillary node infiltration, menopausal status,  estrogen (ER) as well as progesterone (PR) receptor and HER-2 status.  Results:  PIK3CA mutations were detected in 21(21%) of the primary tumors (E542K in one, E545K in 4, E545D in one, H1047R in 11 and H1047L in 4) and were significantly associated with PR+ BC (p\u003d0.036). After a median follow-up of 60.5 (range 4.6-199) months 27 (27%) patients had relapsed and 18 (18%) had died. PIK3CA kinase domain mutations were associated with significantly shorter DFS (p\u003d0.001) and OS (p\u003d0.012). Multivariate analysis showed that PIK3CA kinase domain mutations, nodal involvement and tumor size were independent prognostic factors for OS. The relative risk of death in patients with PIK3CA kinase domain mutations was 7.68 (95% CI \u003d 2.22-26.57, p\u003d0.001).  Conclusions:  Our results suggest that PIK3CA kinase domain mutations are an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in operable breast cancer patients.","title":"Association of PIK3CA kinase domain mutations with poor prognosis in operable breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_81406-102"}
