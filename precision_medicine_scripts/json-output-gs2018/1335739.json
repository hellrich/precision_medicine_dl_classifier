The clinicopathological features of two such pediatric cases of lymph node origin described here, and also the available literature emphasize the heterogenous nature of Ki-1 positive lymphomas, in almost every respect. Nevertheless, the Ki-1 antibody serves as an important diagnostic tool to differentiate lymphomas from other anaplastic, large malignancies.","title":"Ki-1 positive (anaplastic, large cell) lymphoma (case reports and review).","pubmedId":"1335739"}
