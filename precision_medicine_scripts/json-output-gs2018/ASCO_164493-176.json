Multiple factors may contribute to this observation including decline in host anti-tumor immune response with aging. However, the underlying immunologic pathways in which age impacts the anti-tumor immune response are unclear. Methods: We queried the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER), NYUs prospective melanoma biorepository database, and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to examine the association of patient age at time of diagnosis (young: \u003c 45, middle: 46-65, and old: \u003e 65) with clinicopathologic features and melanoma-specific survival (MSS). The prognostic value of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) was evaluated in each age group. Differential expression of 579 immunoregulatory genes was assessed in a subset of the NYU cohort using an integrative pathway analysis. A mediation analysis tested whether gene expression levels transmitted an aging effect on decreased overall survival (OS). TCGA primary melanoma gene expression data served as independent validation. Results: We analyzed 304,476 (SEER), 1,241 (NYU), and 292 (TCGA) patients. Old age associated with shorter MSS in all cohorts (p \u003c 0.001) independent of gender and stage and positively correlated with thickness, ulceration, stage, and mortality in the SEER and NYU cohorts (p \u003c 0.001). Brisk TIL grade in old NYU patients and lymphocyte score 3-6 in middle age TCGA patients associated with prolonged MSS (p \u003c 0.01). The NYU subset (n \u003d 84) showed decreased lymphocyte migration, chemotaxis, and iCOS and CD28 signaling, which associated with decreased OS in the mediation analysis. IL-1B and IFN-g were predicted as inhibitory upstream regulators with aging, leading to downregulation of genes involved in dendritic cell function. The TCGA cohort (n \u003d 41) pathway analysis validated IL-1B as an inhibitory upstream regulator with aging. Conclusions: Ages association with worse clinicopathologic features is dependent upon the specific study cohort. TIL as a read-out of the host immune response may have greater prognostic value in patients \u003e age 45. Recognition of age-related factors negatively impacting host immune responses may provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for the elderly.","title":"Impact of aging on immune response and survival in melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_164493-176"}
