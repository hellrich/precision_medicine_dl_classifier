Analysis of CDKN2A, the gene that encodes the p16 tumor suppressor protein, may further elucidate the association between HPV status and prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). We aimed to identify whether CDKN2A copy number loss was associated with poor survival in HNSCCs stratified by HPV status. Methods: We analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) head and neck cancer data, integrating genomic measurements with clinical metadata. Patients 85 years old or younger with a primary tumor in the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx were included. Defining CDKN2A copy number loss as a relative log2 copy number ratio \u003c0.6, CDKN2A mRNA and p16 protein expression levels were compared to confirm significant differences in gene transcription and translation between the copy number loss and non-copy number loss patient groups. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated to characterize prognostic differences between genomic groups. Results: 397 patients negative for HPV (HPV) and 91 patients positive for HPV (HPV+) HNSCC were identified. 139 HPV patients and 9 HPV+ patients demonstrated CDKN2A copy number loss. The CDKN2A copy number loss group expressed significantly lower levels of CDKN2A mRNA and p16 protein than did the non-copy number loss group in both HPV+ and HPV disease. Median OS for HPV patients with and without CDKN2A copy number loss was 21.8 months and 46.0 months (P \u003d 0.02). Median DFS was 12.0 and 19.4 months respectively (P \u003c 0.05). Median OS for HPV+ patients with and without CDKN2A copy number loss was 12.7 months and 57.4 months (P \u003d 0.004) and median DFS was 7.0 and 36.6 months respectively (P \u003d 0.02). Conclusions: CDKN2A copy number loss was associated with low CDKN2A mRNA and p16 protein expression, with poor prognosis in terms of disease-free and overall survival.","title":"CDKN2A copy number loss in HPV- and HPV+ head and neck cancer to indicate poor prognosis: An integrated genomic and clinical TCGA analysis.","pubmedId":"ASCO_187826-199"}
