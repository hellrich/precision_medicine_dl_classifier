The first protocol combined chemotherapy (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, VM 26, procarbazine) with mediastinal and supra-clavicular radiotherapy in classical fractionation (40 grays in 4 weeks). The second combined a more intensive chemotherapy (adriamycin, VP 16, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide) with an alternating radiotherapy (3 series of 15 grays). All patients received prophylactic brain irradiation. Preliminary results show a 9 month survival rate of 34 per cent and 62.5 per cent respectively. In addition, all patients in the second protocol presented a complete response at the end of the induction treatment. These preliminary data encourage proceeding with this kind of combined treatment.","title":"[Sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy modalities in small cell lung carcinoma.
