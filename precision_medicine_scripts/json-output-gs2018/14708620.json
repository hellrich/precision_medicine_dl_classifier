To evaluate the impact of the T1796A BRAF mutation, we screened primary melanomas, various types of nevi and lesions where a melanoma developed in an underlying nevus. We could detect the mutation in 28 of 97 (29%) melanomas and in 39 of 187 (21%) nevi, including blue nevi (0/20) and Spitz nevi (0/69), which did not carry the mutation. In melanomas with an underlying nevus, either the mutation was present in both the laser-microdissected nevus cells and the laser-microdissected melanoma cells (3/14) or both lesions were negative for the BRAF mutation except one case. In conclusion, mutations in exon 15 of the BRAF gene are nonspecific for progression of a nevus to a melanoma. Other so far unknown cofactors seem to be of importance.","title":"Mutations of the BRAF gene in benign and malignant melanocytic lesions.","pubmedId":"14708620"}
