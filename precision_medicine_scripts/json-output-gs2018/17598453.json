In particular, the c-Met/HGF system can influence progression of lung tumors. The altered c-Met and HGF expression occurs in non-small-cell lung carcinomas. In this work we analyzed changes in c-Met and HGF expression in non-small-cell lung carcinomas by comparing expression levels with those in adjacent non-malignant tissues using semi-quantitative PCR. The c-Met transcript was detected in 50% of squamous cell carcinoma samples with an elevated level observed in 2 out of 25 cases (8%). HGF expression was detected only in two squamous cell carcinomas. At the same time, the c-Met transcript was observed in all 5 studied adenocarcinoma samples with an increased level compared to adjacent non- malignant tissue in 3 cases. HGF transcript was found in 2 adenocarcinoma samples. Therefore, c-Met rather than HGF transcript is frequently observed in non-small-cell lung carcinomas, especially in adenocarcinomas. According to the results of other studies, the c-Met transcript can serve as an indicator of the aggressive behavior and progression of non-small-cell lung carcinomas.","title":"[c-Met and HGF expression in non-small-cell lung carcinomas].","pubmedId":"17598453"}
