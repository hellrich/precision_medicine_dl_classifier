Tumor histology and immunohistochemical staining demonstrated a malignant lymphoma, diffuse large cell type, displaying a CD30 negative B cell immunophenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this specific translocation in lymphoma, which may join the site of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene at 2p23 to the region of the immunoglobulin lambda light chain gene at 22q11.2. The ALK gene was initially identified through its involvement in the t(2;5)(p23;q35) found most commonly in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This observation in a CD30 negative large cell lymphoma of B cell lineage further extends the relationship of anaplastic large cell morphology, ALK activation, lymphoid lineage, and expression of the CD30 antigen.","title":"Diffuse large cell, B-cell type lymphoma with a novel translocation (2;22)(p23;q11.2).","pubmedId":"9216718"}
