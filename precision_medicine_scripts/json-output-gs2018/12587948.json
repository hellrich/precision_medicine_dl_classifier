A case of a 60-year-old male who was admitted to the emergency service with signs of colonic obstruction forced us to reconsider diagnostic and therapeutic implications in anorectal melanoma. Following urgent decompression with laparoscopic sigmoid loop colostomy, the patient was treated with preoperative radiotherapy and local excision. He has since been free of disease for 30 months. The previously published reports are reviewed and the current therapeutic options are discussed.","title":"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy in anorectal malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"12587948"}
