The diagnostic criteria have recently been described. Morphological evidence for basophilic lineage is required for its classification. However the criteria for remission status and standard therapy is not established. Here we have described an atypical case of ABL and reviewed the literature to high light issues regarding diagnosis and management, which need further discussion.","title":"Acute basophilic leukemia with t(8;21).","pubmedId":"15160925"}
