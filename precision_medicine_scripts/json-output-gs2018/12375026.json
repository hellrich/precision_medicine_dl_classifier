Eight human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were infected by the recombinant adenovirus harboring the lacZ gene (AxCAiLacZ) or the wild-type p53 gene (AxCAip53), and the effects were investigated. The eight cell lines were successfully infected by AxCAiLacZ at a level of more than 50%. The survival of all 8 squamous cell lines were inhibited in the range from 8 to 26.7% by only one treatment of the AxCAip53 infection. This result suggested that p53 gene therapy might become a useful tool in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treatment.","title":"Adenoviral p53 gene therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"12375026"}
