Inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction is a promising approach for activating p53, because this association is well characterized at the structural and biological levels. A number of drug screening approaches and technologies have been used to identity novel inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction. This review will detail the development history of MDM2 protein and the p53-MDM2 interaction, the major classes of novel small-molecular p53-MDM2 binding inhibitors, key medicinal action with the protein-protein interaction and in vitro or in vivo biological activities.","title":"Small molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2.","pubmedId":"18673221"}
