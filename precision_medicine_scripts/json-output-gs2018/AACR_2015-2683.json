Defining the landscape of genetic alterations that participate in cancer transformation provides insight into the diversity of clinical responses observed to targeted treatments. Here, we identified concurrent mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressors TP53 and PTEN as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanomas harboring mutant V600EBRAF.Defects in TP53 function and PTEN loss occur in 17% and 12% of malignant melanomas respectively, rendering cells dependent on CHK1 to maintain normal cell cycle progression. We demonstrate that CHK1 inhibition increases sensitivity to a variety of alkylating agents and targeted therapies in V600EBRAF mutant, TP53/PTEN deficient cell lines and patient derived xenografts. Inhibition of CHK1 concurrently with the induction of either DNA damage or replication stress leads to mitotic catastrophe and cell death in our in vitro and in vivo models of TP53/PTEN deficient tumors. In the case of externally applied cellular stress from chemotherapeutics, our results suggest CHK1 inhibition may sensitise this genetically defined subset of melanomas to such treatments.Our results provide some insight into the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes observed when treating BRAF mutant melanomas with BRAF inhibitor and suggest a need for comprehensive screening of TP53 and PTEN inactivation in these patients.","title":"Simultaneous inactivation of TP53 and loss of PTEN diminish response to targeted therapy in V600EBRAF mutant melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2683"}
