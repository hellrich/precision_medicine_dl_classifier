Although the phenomenon of tumor to tumor metastasis to a meningioma has been previously reported, this is the first case in the literature to date, in which the primary tumor is a malignant melanoma. The criteria for the diagnosis of tumor-to-tumor metastasis and possible reasons for the frequency of metastasis to meningiomas are briefly reviewed.","title":"Malignant melanoma metastatic to a meningioma.","pubmedId":"10399174"}
