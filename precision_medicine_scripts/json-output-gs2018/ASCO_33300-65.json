We measured the serum levels of TXB2 in patients with NSCLC. Methods: Serial blood samples were withdrawn from each patient before and after the administration of erlotinib. TXB2 was measured by enzyme-linked immuno solvent assay. The kit was used according to the manufacturer\u0027s instructions. Results: The serum levels of TXB2 were elevated after treatment with erlotinib. Two cases developed skin lesion then treated with low dose aspirin. Skin lesions were better with improving itching without disease progression. Conclusions: We think that platelets activity, COX-1, COX-2 and PGI2 / TXA2 ratio are one of factor of anti-cancer and adverse effect for EGFR-TKI. And low dose aspirin may be useful for adverse effect of erlotinib and other EGFR-TKI.","title":"Effect of erlotinib on platelet activation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_33300-65"}
