The radiation oncologist is presented with the formidable challenge of trying to deliver high doses of radiation to the malignant lesion while avoiding excessive damage to the surrounding normal tissues. Lung cancer can be classified as either small cell lung cancer or non-small cell lung cancer with respect to its response to therapy. The article reviews the role that radiation therapy plays in the different stages within each classification. Slow progress toward the goal of controlling this disease is being made, and physicians should encourage patients to participate in clinical trials.","title":"The management of lung cancer with radiation therapy: where we are now and where we are going.","pubmedId":"1664002"}
