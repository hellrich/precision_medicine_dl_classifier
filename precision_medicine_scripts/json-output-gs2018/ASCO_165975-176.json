{"publicationTypes":["2016 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: Melanoma (MM) has a dramatically poor prognosis in case of late diagnosis, emphasizing the critical role of early detection and prevention. We have developed a predictive algorithm calculating an individualized mm risk by combining clinical and genetic factors (test Melapred). We evaluated the acceptability of this test in a pilot study of patients seen in dermatology at hospital or in liberal exercise. Methods: The Melapred test allows the custom calculation of a personnalized mm risk score using an algorithm incorporating clinical risk factors and genetic mm risk factors. From April to October 2014, 261 patients were proposed to have the Melapred test, and results were given during a second clinical consultation, with explanations provided on the impact of the test result on clinical management and behaviour towards UV exposure. A survey was given to the patients, evaluating the service and potential impact of the Melapred test result. A questionnaire to physicians was also performed evaluating the usefulness of Melapred for high-risk mm patients in their daily exercise. An agreement of the local ethic committee has been obtained. Clinical data were collected on data sheet, and salivary DNA was collected by Oragene kit after information, signature and informed consent. Results: The Melapred test classified 64% of patients at high risk, 26% of patients at intermediate risk and 10% at low risk. The survey for the first 163 patients showed a positive evaluation with perception of its usefulness (90%), a clear desire to follow the recommendations of the physicians and to adapte their UV exposition to their mm score, a lack of anxiety generated by pending the result of the test. The physicians also had a very good evaluation of the test in terms of easy logistic, and help to survey and monitoring their patients. Therefore, the Melapred test is very well received and considered useful by patients and physicians, and is not cause of concern. Conclusions: Melapred test is well accepted and perceived by patients and physicians. Indications are the identification of high-risk patients and improved screening. Melapred is commercialized since july 2015 (www.melapred.com) under dermatogical prescription.","title":"Melapred: first susceptibility test to sporadic melanoma in daily dermatological practice.","pubmedId":"ASCO_165975-176"}
