They are mainly located in the palm of the hand and the sole of the foot, the digits, the head and the trunk. We report on a now 68-year-old male, who underwent partial amputation of the thumb at the level of the proximal phalanx due to an eccrine carcinoma in 1990. In the following years, three local recurrences were excised. After the exclusion of metastases an amputation at the MP I level was performed at our institution. To restore grip function, we performed a distraction of the first metacarpal bone followed by deepening of the first web space. So far, there are no defined treatment recommendations due to the rarity of the tumor. In some cases, metastatic disease has been reported, and in most cases, a high rate of local recurrence. After diagnostic biopsy, we recommend staging to exclude metastatic spread of the tumor followed by aggressive local surgical treatment.","title":"[Recurrent highly-differentiated eccrine carcinoma of the thumb -- a case report].","pubmedId":"15503267"}
