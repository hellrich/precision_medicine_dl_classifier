In the present study, the authors investigated the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin in gastric cancer tissues and cultured gastric cancer cells, and examined their clinical value in gastric cancer.\nThe protein was extracted from gastric cancer tissues and cultured gastric cancer cells (MKN-28 and Kato-III) and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin was examined by western blotting. The clinical significance of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin was explored, using immunohistochemical staining of specimens from 157 gastric cancer patients.\nIn western blot analysis, the expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in gastric cancer tissues and cultured gastric cancer cells were increased, however, E-selectin in gastric cancer tissues and cells were not increased. Among 157 gastric cancer patients, 79 patients (50%) were intercellular adhesion molecule-1 positive and had larger tumor size, an increased depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis and perineural invasion. The intercellular adhesion molecule-1 positive group showed a higher incidence of tumor recurrence (40.5%), and a poorer 3-year survival than the negative group (54.9 vs. 85.9%, respectively).\nIntercellular adhesion molecule-1 is overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues and cultured gastric cancer cells, whereas E-selectin is not overexpressed. Increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in gastric cancer could be related to the aggressive nature of the tumor, and has a poor prognostic effect on gastric cancer.","title":"Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and e-selectin in gastric cancer and their clinical significance.","pubmedId":"23094225"}
