Historically, DMs that display PNI have been grouped under the umbrella term of neurotropic melanoma (NM). However, definitions for NM and desmoplastic NM are not consistent in the literature, presenting a barrier to a comprehensive understanding of these lesions. In this review, we parse the literature on DM, NM, and desmoplastic NM, to clarify definitions and ascertain the incidence of PNI, with a view toward understanding its prognostic relevance. Neurotrophins, which represent a family of signaling peptides important to the development and maintenance of the peripheral nervous system, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PNI in select lineage-unrelated malignancies. Given this, we also detail evidence linking neurotrophins and their receptors (TrkA, RET, p75NGFR, and NCAM) to the pathogenesis of PNI in melanoma.","title":"Desmoplastic melanoma, neurotropism, and neurotrophin receptors--what we know and what we do not.","pubmedId":"26050260"}
