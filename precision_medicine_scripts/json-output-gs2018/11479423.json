The biological heterogeneity of tumour cells presents a major problem, preventing effective treatment of melanoma. To examine the degree of genetic heterogeneity, we searched for allelic losses (loss of heterozygosity; LOH) on chromosomes 9p, 9q, 1p and 17p, examining different areas within human melanoma metastases. All of the examined metastases were informative within at least one dissected area for at least one marker. Out of 29 areas in 11 melanoma metastases, 58% showed LOH with at least one marker. On chromosome 9p21-22, eight out of 26 informative loci (31%) showed LOH at D9S171 (three not informative), two out of 18 (11%) at IFNA (11 not informative) and seven out of 24 (29%) at D9S169 (five not informative). LOH on chromosome 9q22.3 was examined by the microsatellite marker D9S12; three out of 24 areas (12.5%) showed LOH, and five were not informative. Deletions on chromosome 1p were assessed using D1S450. Four out of 25 (16%) showed LOH; four were not informative. Deletions on chromosome 17p13 were examined with TP53; two out of 21 cases (9%) showed LOH, and eight were not informative. Our data demonstrate an impressive heterogeneity of allelic losses in the investigated chromosomal areas within the same metastatic lesion. This suggests that there is not one specific genetic alteration that accounts for melanoma progression to metastases. Rather there seem to be multiple genetic alterations accumulating even on the same chromosome, and progression from melanoma to metastases is paralleled by the accumulation of clones harbouring multiple genetic abnormalities.","title":"Heterogeneity of allelic deletions within melanoma metastases.","pubmedId":"11479423"}
