At the same time, we compared the ability of serum HER-2/neu, CA15.3, CA12-5, CA19-9, carcino embryonic antigen (CEA), and alpha-feto-protein (AFP) in breast, colorectal, and lung cancer patients. Forty, thirty-six, and twenty-three patients with lung, colon and breast cancer were included in this study, respectively. Serum levels of HER-2/neu, CA15.3, CA12-5, CA19-9, CEA, and AFP were measured. Her-2 neu levels were significantly higher in the breast cancer groups than colorectal and lung cancer and controls groups (P \u003c 0.01). There is no significant difference when compared with others groups (P \u003e 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the HER-2/neu and CA15-3 values in breast cancer groups. We found 0.75(0.59-0.90) for Her-2/neu from the area under the curve (AUC). P-value for breast cancer is 0.003, and we discovered that 9 ng/ml was the best inersection point. In this situation, we calculated that sensitivity was 65.2%, specificity was 100%, positive predictive value was 100%, negative predictive value 75.8%, and accuracy was 83.4%. These findings indicate that serum HER2/neu levels are clinically valuable in monitoring metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients. Prognosis of breast cancer provides an additional value over the commonly used CA15-3 test. Measurements of levels of serum HER-2/neu provide prognostic and predictive information to the clinician and can especially be used for monitoring metastatic breast cancer patients. Further clinical validation is needed to confirm these findings.","title":"Clinical significance and prognostic value of serum sHER-2/neu levels in patients with solid tumors.","pubmedId":"18855148"}
