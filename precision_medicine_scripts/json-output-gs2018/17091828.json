Breath-hold divers perform this technique after a maximal inhalation prior to diving, thus increasing initial lung volume. However, as suggested by previous authors, this breathing maneuver could theoretically lead to lung rupture. Here we report a pneumomediastinum found on chest CT scan in a diver during a physiological study, when glossopharyngeal insufflation increased the volume of gas in the lungs by 1,040 ml (over his total lung capacity); at the same time, his transpulmonary pressures increased up to 4.1 kPa. We discuss the possibility that the very high transpulmonary pressures during lung packing caused this pneumomediastinum.","title":"Pneumomediastinum after lung packing.","pubmedId":"17091828"}
