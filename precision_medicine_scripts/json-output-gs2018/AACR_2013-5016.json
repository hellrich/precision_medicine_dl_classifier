Using fluorescence-guided sampling we integrated copy number aberration, gene expression and molecular clock data to show that the sub-ependymal zone (SEZ) contains precursor cells of the corresponding mass. The genetically distinct tumor margin contains non self-renewing cells that retain the potential to regenerate the tumor. Functional assays confirmed that SEZ and marginal disease were less clinically aggressive compared to the mass compartment in the same tumor. However, resistance to supra-maximal chemotherapy doses and differential patterns of drug response were observed between compartments. These data provide novel insights into the basis of clinical diversity, poor treatment response and emergence of resistant disease in GB patients.","title":"The human sub-ependymal zone harbors glioblastoma precursors and represents a distinct therapeutic target.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-5016"}
