We report the development of a systemic ALK-negative T-cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma, stage IIB, in a 53-yr-old Caucasian female with a 12-yr history of stable SLE. The patient responded poorly to chemotherapy and died 2 yr after diagnosis. Lymphomas that develop in patients with SLE and other autoimmune diseases are virtually always of B-cell origin. To our knowledge this is the first report of a T-cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma in a patient with SLE. This article discusses the association of SLE and lymphoma, with an emphasis on T-lymphoproliferative states.","title":"ALK-negative T-cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.","pubmedId":"14716040"}
