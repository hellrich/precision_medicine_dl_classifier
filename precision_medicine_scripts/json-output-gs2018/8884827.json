MEN 2B is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma with oral, ocular, and alimentary submucosal ganglioneuromas and Marfanoid body features. Approximately 50% of cases are thought to be spontaneous mutations. The RET protooncogene (RET) is a 21-exon gene encoding a tyrosine kinase receptor. A codon 918 germ line mutation, which converts a highly conserved methionine to a threonine in the intracellular tyrosine kinase portion of this receptor of RET, has been identified in 95% of patients with MEN 2B. This mutation is easily detected by a direct deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing or restriction enzyme (Fok 1) analysis of amplified polymerase chain reaction products. The RET gene is normally expressed in the oral and gastrointestinal submucosal neural ganglia, and the codon 918 mutation is thought to cause neuromas by virtue of its transforming activity in these ganglia. Identifying clinical features of MEN 2B in an 11-year-old boy by an oral pathologist led to confirmation by mutational analysis. Before genetic testing was available, the patient, and at a later date his mother, underwent thyroidectomies based solely on biochemical testing. Results indicated the patient had the codon 918 mutation, whereas his phenotypically normal mother, father, and older brother had normal RET analyses. Studies in families have demonstrated that the mutant allele is derived from the father with possible acquisition during spermatogenesis. We believe the mother of our affected patient to be normal; the absence of phenotypic features of MEN 2B and a normal genotype suggest her calcitonin abnormalities and minimal evidence for C-cell hyperplasia were inconsequential. Molecular analysis for RET abnormalities will likely supplant biochemical methods of diagnosis in patients with MEN 2B.","title":"RET protooncogene mutational analysis in multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2B: case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"8884827"}
