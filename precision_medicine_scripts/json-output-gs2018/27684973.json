Indeed, the recently released 2016 World Health Organization classification now recognizes 12 distinct RCC subtypes, as well as several other emerging/provisional RCC entities. From a clinical perspective, accurate RCC classification may have important implications for patients and their families, including prognostic risk stratification, targeted therapeutics selection, and identification for genetic testing. In this review, we provide a conceptual framework for approaching RCC diagnosis and classification by categorizing RCCs as tumors with clear cytoplasm, papillary architecture, and eosinophilic (oncocytic) cytoplasm. The currently recognized 2016 World Health Organization classification for RCC subtypes is briefly discussed, including new diagnostic entities (clear cell papillary RCC, hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC-associated RCC, succinate dehydrogenase-deficient RCC, tubulocystic RCC, and acquired cystic disease-associated RCC) and areas of evolving RCC classification, such as transcription elongation factor B subunit 1 (TCEB1)-mutated RCC/RCC with angioleiomyoma-like stroma/RCC with leiomyomatous stroma, RCC associated with anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement, thyroidlike follicular RCC, and RCC in neuroblastoma survivors. For each RCC subtype, relevant clinical, molecular, gross, and microscopic findings are reviewed, and ancillary studies helpful for its differential diagnosis are presented, providing a practical approach to modern RCC classification.
