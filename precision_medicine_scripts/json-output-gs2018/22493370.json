At first evaluation following induction treatment, there was marked increase in the volume of the lymphadenopathies (including new adenopathies) and strong uptake of (18)Fluorodeoxy-D-glucose ((18)FDG); marked enlargement of the spleen and interstitial lung infiltrates were also observed. Non-necrotising granulomas were discovered on transbronchial mucosal biopsy and cytology on bronchoalveolar lavage established the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. There was a marked clinical and (18)FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) documented response following six weeks of corticotherapy. At follow-up, progression of subdiaphragmatic melanoma lymph node metastases was documented. Regression of these metastatic sites was observed during treatment with the selective v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) inhibitor vemurafenib. The patient died due to progressive disease after three months of vemurafenib treatment. Our case report illustrates the need to take into consideration exacerbation of sarcoidosis as a potential confounder in the assessment of tumor response in a melanoma patient treated with the anti-CTLA-4 mononclonal antibody ipilimumab.","title":"Sarcoidosis in a patient with metastatic melanoma sequentially treated with anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody and selective BRAF inhibitor.","pubmedId":"22493370"}
