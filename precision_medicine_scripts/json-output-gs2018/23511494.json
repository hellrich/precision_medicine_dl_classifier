RNA and DNA were extracted from bone marrow samples of 186 (106 male and 80 female) pediatric patients younger than 17 year with de novo AML. Mutations and chromosomal rearrangements were detected by sequencing of a corresponding gene. NPM1 mutations were found in 5.2%, FLT3 mutations in 12.1%, c-KIT mutations in 3.7% of the patients. NPM1 mutations were associated with the absence of chromosomal aberrations (P\u003d0.007) and FLT3/ITD (P\u003d0.018). New data on incidence of c-KIT mutations in various AML subtypes as well as new variations of c-KIT mutations in the exon 8 are presented. The results are compared to previously published studies on NPM1, FLT3, c-KIT mutations in various populations. No statistically significant differences in survival rates between groups with or without of FLT3, NPM1, c-KIT mutations were found (P\u003e0.05). Meanwhile, 4-year overall survival rates were higher in patients having NPM1 mutations comparing with NPM1/WT patients (100% vs. 50%) and in patients having FLT3 mutations comparing with FLT3/WT patients (70% vs. 50%). The data presented contribute to knowledge on incidence and prognostic significance of the mutations in pediatric AML.","title":"NPM1, FLT3, and c-KIT mutations in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia in Russian population.","pubmedId":"23511494"}
