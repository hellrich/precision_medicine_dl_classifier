Although cDNAs encoding the previously identified melanoma Ags, tyrosinase and gp100, were isolated, these TIL were found to recognize previously unidentified peptides. An HLA-A1-restricted CTL, TIL1388, was found to recognize a tyrosinase peptide (SSDYVIPIGTY), and an HLA-A3-restricted CTL, TIL1351, recognized a gp100 peptide (LIYRRRLMK). CTL clones isolated from the HLA-A2-restricted TIL1383 recognized a gp100 peptide (RLMKQDFSV). HLA-A2-restricted CTL, TIL1200, recognized a gp100 peptide (RLPRIFCSC). Replacement of either cysteine residue with alpha-amino butyric acid in the gp100 peptide, RLPRIFCSC, enhanced CTL recognition, suggesting that the peptide epitope naturally presented on the tumor cell surface may contain reduced cysteine residues. Oxidation of these cysteines might have occurred during the course of the synthesis or pulsing of the peptide in culture. These modifications may have important implications for the development of efficient peptide-based vaccines. These newly identified peptide epitopes can extend the ability to perform immunotherapy using synthetic peptides to a broader population of patients, especially those expressing HLA-A1 or HLA-A3 for whom only a few melanoma epitopes have previously been identified.","title":"Identification of new melanoma epitopes on melanosomal proteins recognized by tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes restricted by HLA-A1, -A2, and -A3 alleles.","pubmedId":"9862734"}
