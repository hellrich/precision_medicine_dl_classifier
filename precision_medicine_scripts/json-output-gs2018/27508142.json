{"keywords":["Adenoid cystic","Carcinoma","Malignant neoplasm","Salivary gland disorders"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm most commonly originating in salivary glands of head and neck region. Among intra oral adenoid cystic carcinoma, buccal mucosa is among the rarest sites. We report a case of adenoid cystic of buccal mucosa in a 40-year old female. We have discussed the clinical features, histopathology, diagnosis and treatment along with a brief review of the relevant literature. Although the buccal mucosa is an uncommon site for adenoid cystic carcinoma, the relatively indolent growth pattern of this case and its location which is rather atypical for this type of salivary gland malignancy primarily warrants the necessity behind reporting of this case. Secondly, adenoid cystic carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mass of buccal mucosa. It is important to identify such cases rather early and surgical removal with adequate margins is the treatment of choice .
