Risk of colorectal adenomas and breast cancer was 45 and 2.4 times higher than CIN 2-3 (0.2319, 95% CI: 0.1287-0.3624 and 0.0122, 95% CI: 0.0089-0.0017 vs. 0.0051, 95% CI: 0.0029-0.0081). After the age to end screening, breast and colorectal cancer risk was 17 and 11 times higher, respectively, than cervical cancer.\nRisk of cervical cancer at and after the recommended ages for screening is significantly lower than that of breast and colorectal cancer. Differences may become more pronounced in the era of HPV vaccines. Comparison of risk between cancers provides a novel perspective to inform future guideline development.","title":"The significantly lower risk of cervical cancer at and after the recommended age to begin and end screening compared to breast and colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"25937628"}
