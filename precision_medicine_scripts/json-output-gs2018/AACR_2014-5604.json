PD-L1 is a transmembrane molecule that can be expressed by melanoma cells and that has been speculated to play role in inducing immunosuppression by interacting with the PD-1 receptor on T cells. The clinical and biological significance of PD-L1 expression in metastatic melanoma remains partially elusive.Methods: PD-L1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using two different antibodies [anti-human B7-H1 monoclonal antibody (clone 5H1) and a rabbit polyclonal AB58810 antibody (Abcam)]. In primary tumors and paired metastases from 83 consecutive melanoma patients treated at a single institution. Protein expression levels were correlated with PD-L1 mRNA, BRAF mutational status and clinical outcome. PD-L1+ and PD-L1- subsets of the A375 cell line were stabilized in vitro and compared using gene expression profiling and functional assays. Results were confirmed in vivo using xenograft models.Results: PD-L1 membrane positivity was detected in 24/83 (19%) of patients. By multivariate analysis, PD-L1 membrane expression (95% CI 1.48-4.67, P\u003c 0.001), age \u003e57 years [CI 95% 1.20-3.71, P\u003c 0.009] and stage M1c (95% CI 1.01-3.38, P\u003c 0.045) were independent predictors of poor prognosis. PD-L1 expression defined a subset of the A375 cell line characterized by a specific genetic profile. PD-L1+ A375 cells also showed a highly invasive phenotype and enhanced ability to grow in vivo using immunocompromised mouse models.Conclusions: PD-L1 may be proposed as a novel prognostic marker in metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, it defines a distinct morpho-phenotypic subset of the disease with a specific genetic signature and a different biological behavior. Future studies will tell whether PD-L1 targeting using blocking monoclonal antibodies alone or in combination with other treatments will provide clinical benefit.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.","title":"PD-L1 expression identifies a subpopulation of melanoma cells characterized by enhanced invasiveness and aggressiveness","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-5604"}
