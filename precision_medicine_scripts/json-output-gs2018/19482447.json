The effect of concomitant diseases and drug therapies was also studied.\nDescribing the epidemiology of female sexual dysfunction is difficult due to the fact that it has not been studied extensively and because different classification systems have been employed. Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish between various types of sexual dysfunction and possible co-morbidities. In general, 40% of women will experience some form of sexual problem, although in only 12-25% it is associated with personal distress. The diseases which cause sexual dysfunction are those which affect mobility and activity, as well as body image and feeling attractive.\nThe prevalence of female sexual problems is high and personal distress is less common but is an important factor. However, more research is necessary in order to determine the prevalence of each sexual dysfunction in different populations and the relation these dysfunctions have with respect to different diseases and drug therapies. Sexual dysfunction is often one of the first symptoms of a disease or an adverse drug reaction.","title":"Epidemiology of female sexual dysfunction.","pubmedId":"19482447"}
