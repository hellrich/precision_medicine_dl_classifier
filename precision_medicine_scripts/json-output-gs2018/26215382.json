The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of core-needle biopsy with BRAF(V600E) mutation analysis (CNB + BRAF(V600E) ) and to compare the clinical usefulness of CNB + BRAF(V600E) and fine-needle aspiration with BRAF(V600E) mutation analysis (FNA + BRAF(V600E) ) in the diagnosis of thyroid malignancy.\nThe results of BRAF(V600E) mutation analyses of 820 nodules from 820 patients (153 men, 667 women; mean age, 51·1 years), who underwent CNB + BRAF(V600E) (n \u003d 256) or FNA + BRAF(V600E) (n \u003d 564) between January 2011 and March 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. The feasibility of CNB + BRAF(V600E) was assessed by comparing its rate of detection of BRAF(V600E) mutations and positive predictive value with those of FNA + BRAF(V600E) . The clinical usefulness of CNB + BRAF(V600E) was determined by comparing rates of inconclusive results, the additional value of BRAF(V600E) mutation analysis, diagnostic surgery and diagnostic performance with those of FNA + BRAF(V600E) .\nCNB + BRAF(V600E) and FNA + BRAF(V600E) had similar rates of BRAF(V600E) mutation detection (66·3% vs 64·4%, P \u003d 0·883) and positive predictive value (100·0% vs 96·6%, P \u003d 0·135). CNB + BRAF(V600E) had a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy rate (95·7% vs 85·9%, P \u003c 0·001), and significantly lower rates of inconclusive results (8·2% vs 51·8%, P \u003c 0·001), and diagnostic surgery (8·9% vs 22·3%, P \u003d 0·006), than FNA + BRAF(V600E) .\nThe greater diagnostic performance of CNB + BRAF(V600E) and its lower rate of inconclusive results than FNA + BRAF(V600E) suggest that CNB + BRAF(V600E) can reduce rates of preventable diagnostic surgery.","title":"Initial clinical experience with BRAF(V600E) mutation analysis of core-needle biopsy specimens from thyroid nodules.","pubmedId":"26215382"}
