However, little is known about the expression of this protein in T-cell lymphomas. Cyclin-dependent kinase pathway inhibitors are in development, therefore identifying cyclin D1-positive T-cell lymphomas may provide a therapeutic target in a disease where novel treatments are urgently needed. We collected 200 peripheral T-cell lymphomas from three institutions including the following types of cases: 34 anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK+, 44 anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK negative, 68 peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified, 24 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas, 7 extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas, 4 enteropathy associated T-cell lymphomas, 3 hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas, 12 cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, and 4 large granular lymphocytic leukemias. Immunohistochemical stains for cyclin D1 protein (SP4 clone) were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue. In a subset of cases, IGH/CCND1 fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was also performed. Cyclin D1 staining was predominantly seen in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, including 8 of 34 cases with ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (24%), and 3 of 44 cases of ALK-negative (7%) anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Three cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, were also positive (3/68, 4%). All other T-cell lymphomas were negative for cyclin D1. In four of the cyclin D1-positive T-cell lymphomas by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was negative for IGH/CCND1 translocation or extra copies of the CCND1 gene. Cyclin D1 overexpression by immunohistochemistry is not limited to B-cell lymphomas and is also observed in some peripheral T-cell lymphomas, particularly in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK+. Cyclin D1 expression was not associated with extra copies or translocation of the CCND1 gene. Cyclin D1 overexpression may be the result of a post-translational phenomenon and may represent a potential therapeutic target using agents that target the cyclin-dependent kinase pathway.","title":"Cyclin D1 expression in peripheral T-cell lymphomas.","pubmedId":"27469326"}
