In this study, we investigated the anti-melanoma and anti-angiogenic activity of SKLB-M8 on three melanoma cell lines (A2058, CHL-1, and B16F10) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In vitro, SKLB-M8 showed anti-proliferative activity with IC50 values of 0.07, 0.25, and 0.88 Î¼M in A2058, CHL-1, and B16F10 cell lines, respectively. Flow cytometory analysis showed that SKLB-M8 induced G2/M arrest in three melanoma cell lines, and western blotting demonstrated that SKLB-M8 down-regulated the expression of cdc2, up-regulated p53 in A2058 and CHL-1 cells, and triggered cell apoptosis through down-regulating AKT and phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR). SKLB-M8 also inhibited HUVEC proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation in vitro with the inhibition of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2). In vivo, alginate-encapsulated tumor cell assay revealed that SKLB-M8 suppressed B16F10 tumor angiogenesis. In CHL-1- and B16F10-tumor-bearing mouse models, SKLB-M8 inhibited tumor growth by oral treatment with less toxicity. CD31 immunofluoresence staining and caspase-3 immunohistochemistry indicated that SKLB-M8 inhibited melanoma tumor growth by targeting angiogenesis and inducing caspase3-dependent apoptosis. SKLB-M8 might be a potential anti-melanoma drug candidate.
