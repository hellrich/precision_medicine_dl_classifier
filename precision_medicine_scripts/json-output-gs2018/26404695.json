Association of CIAPIN1 expression with clinicopathological characteristics of gastric cancer was analyzed by Chi-square test. SGC-7901 cell lines of high CIAPIN1 expression and low CIAPIN1 expression were established. Transwell assay was applied to detect the invasion and migration of CIAPIN1-regulated gastric cancer cells.\nPositive rate of CIAPIN1 expression in gastric cancer tissues was lower than that in normal gastric mucosa tissues (41.2% vs. 86.7%, P\u003d0.0008), and in metastasis gastric cancer tissues was also lower than that in non-metastasis gastric cancer tissues (34.9% vs. 71.4%, P\u003d0.0000). Furthermore, the positive rate of CIAPIN1 expression was closely related to the TNM staging of gastric cancer (TNM stage I(, II( and III( were 55.0%, 53.5% and 24.4%, respectively, P\u003d0.0037). But there was no significant difference of positive expressive rate between metastatic gastric cancer tissues and metastatic lymph node tissues(34.9% vs. 21.6%, P\u003d0.3700). Transwell assay showed that up-regulated CIAPIN1 expression would significantly reduce, while down-regulated CIAPIN1 expression would significantly promote the invasion and migration of SGC-7901 cells (all P\u003c0.05).\nPositive rate of CIAPIN1 expression is low in gastric cancer tissues and shows inhibition of invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells.","title":"[Expression of cytokine-induced apoptosis inhibitor 1 in gastric cancer tissues and its effects on invasion and migration of SGC-7901 cell].","pubmedId":"26404695"}
