In 1998, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Melanoma Staging Committee developed the AJCC melanoma staging database, an international integrated compilation of prospectively accumulated melanoma outcome data from several centers and clinical trial cooperative groups. Analysis of this database resulted in major revisions to the TNM staging system reflected in the sixth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual published in 2002. More recently, the committee\u0027s analysis of an updated melanoma staging database, including prospective data on more than 50,000 patients, led to staging revisions adopted in the seventh edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual published in 2009. This article highlights these revisions, reviews relevant prognostic factors and their impact on staging, and discusses emerging tools that will likely affect future staging systems and clinical practice.","title":"Staging and prognosis of cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"21111956"}
