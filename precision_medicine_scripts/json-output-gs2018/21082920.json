Activating mutations in the FLT3 receptor can be detected in approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and are associated with a distinctly poor clinical outcome for patients. There are now several classes of FLT3 inhibitors in development with varying degrees of potency and selectivity for the target, including several in late-phase clinical trials in combination with chemotherapy. Major clinical responses in AML patients receiving single-agent FLT3 inhibitors have been rare, although transient peripheral blood blast reduction is common. Given such biological suggestion and preclinical activity, FLT3 inhibitors hold promise in improving the outcome of patients with mutant FLT3 AML. This review summarizes the current attempts to target this molecule, with emphasis on the validity of the target, the results of the clinical trials evaluating the FLT3 inhibitors in AML, the optimal use of these compounds and the mechanisms of resistance.","title":"FLT3 inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"21082920"}
