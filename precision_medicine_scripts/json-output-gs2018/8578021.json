Biopsy of the right paratracheal nodes revealed poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma with extensive necrosis. In patients infected with HIV the incidence of primary lung carcinoma is unknown. Despite these uncertainties, primary lung carcinoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of young HIV-infected individuals presenting with intrathoracic radiographic abnormalities.","title":"Poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma of the lung in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.","pubmedId":"8578021"}
