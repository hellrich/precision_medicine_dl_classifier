Using Ptch(flox/flox)CD4Cre(+/-) mice, in which Ptch was ablated in CD4Cre-expressing cells, we demonstrate that the targeted cells can give rise to BCC after treatment with DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene)/TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), but not after wounding of the skin. In addition, in this model, BCC are not caused by malfunctioning of Ptch-deficient T cells, as BCC did not develop when bone marrow (BM) of Ptch(flox/flox)CD4Cre(+/-) mice was transplanted into Ptch wild-type mice. Instead, lineage-tracing experiments and flow cytometric analyses suggest that the tumors are initiated from rare Ptch-deficient stem cell-like cells of the epidermis that express CD4. As DMBA/TPA is a prerequisite for BCC development in this model, the initiated cells need a second stimulus for expansion and tumor formation. However, in contrast to papilloma, this stimulus seems to be unrelated to alterations in the Ras signaling cascade. Together, these data suggest that biallelic loss of Ptch in CD4(+) cells does not suffice for BCC formation and that BCC formation requires a second so far unknown event, at least in the Ptch(flox/flox)CD4Cre(+/-) BCC mouse model.
