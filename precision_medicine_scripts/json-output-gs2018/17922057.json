He was admitted to the hospital with the symptoms of anemia and fever. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. Immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of a triple M gradient (double IgM and an IgG), with the IgG and one of the IgM paraproteins functioning as a cryoglobulin. The patient had no hepatitis C virus infection. Bone marrow biopsy showed massive CD30-positive, ALK-negative large lymphoid cell infiltration of T-cell origin with anaplastic morphology. PCR analysis of lymphoid cells separated from the bone marrow demonstrated the presence of a B/T hybrid genotype disorder with no evidence of the t(2;5), nor t(1;2) translocations. The patient entered a period of remission following CHOP chemotherapy. The patient subsequently died of sepsis as a consequence of serious humoral immunodeficiency.","title":"Primary bone marrow T-cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma with triple M gradient.","pubmedId":"17922057"}
