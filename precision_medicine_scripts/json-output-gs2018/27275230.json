One hundred and nine cases of intracranial gliomas were collected between 2008 and 2014 from Mosul Private Laboratories and Al-Jamboree Teaching Hospitals in Mosul. IDH1 mutations were assessed immunohistochemically using anti-IDH1 R132H mouse monoclonal antibody.\nIDH1 mutation was perceived in 34.86% of gliomas. In adult gliomas, the secondary glioblastoma and the low-grade astrocytoma had the greatest values of IDH1 positivity (88.88% and 62.5% respectively), followed by oligoastrocytoma/oligodendroglioma (50.0%), and anaplastic astrocytoma (47.36%). The primary glioblastomsa showed 17.64% IDH1 positivity. Males and females expressed the IDH1 equally. While, there was no role of IDH1 in pediatric gliomas.\nIDH1 mutation is commonly present in adult gliomas particularly in low-grade gliomas, and secondary glioblastoma, with equal sex distribution, but it has no role in pediatric gliomas.","title":"IDH1 Mutation in Gliomas in Mosul City - Iraq.","pubmedId":"27275230"}
