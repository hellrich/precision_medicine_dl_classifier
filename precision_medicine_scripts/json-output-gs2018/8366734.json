The 5-year survival rate of 29.8% was consistent with that yielded by comparable analyses of other investigators. However, the probability of recurrence in the node dissection field was as high as 35%. All groin recurrences occurred in the first 29 months after lymph node clearance (median 6 months). Patients with groin recurrence following lymph-node dissection had a poor prognosis (median survival 12 months). In a multifactorial analysis (Cox model), the only prognostic factor of probability of recurrence was the development of regional in-transit cutaneous metastases (p \u003d 0.0028). Factors that did not affect the appearance of recurrent metastases in the node dissection field were: site of primary melanoma, tumor thickness, epidermal ulceration, degree of lymph node involvement (p \u003d 0.2) age, sex, degree of surgery (superficial or deep groin dissection) and adjuvant chemotherapy. Because regional in-transit cutaneous metastases mostly occur synchronously with groin recurrence or later, they are a typical concomitant phenomenon rather than a prognostic factor of recurrence.","title":"[Inguinal recurrence after therapeutic lymphadenectomy in malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"8366734"}
