This study aimed to explore the expression and role of TSH receptor (TSHR) in PTC, to provide a theoretical basis for optimization of endocrine treatment options in PTC.\nExpression of TSHR was tested by immunohistochemistry of tissues from 150 cases of PTC and 21 normal thyroid tissues. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses, and multivariate analysis was done using a Cox model. The regulatory effects of the TSH-TSHR signal transduction pathway on differentiated thyroid carcinoma cells were explored in vitro.\nThe positive expression rate of TSHR in PTC was 68% (102/150). TSHR expression was an independent factor affecting the prognosis of PTC patients aged \u003e 45 years (p \u003d 0.006), and TSHR might have a role in decreasing distant metastasis (p \u003d 0.024). In vitro experiments showed that up-regulation of TSHR promoted apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells and inhibited metastasis significantly. There was no significant regulatory effect of the TSH-TSHR signal transduction pathway on the proliferation of thyroid carcinoma cells.\nTSHR expression is an independent factor that affects the prognosis of PTC patients, and might decrease distant metastasis in patient aged \u003e 45 years. Up-regulation of TSHR could inhibit metastasis and promote apoptosis in PTC cells.","title":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor affects metastasis and prognosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"27649658"}
