We sought to determine whether there are specific sequences of occurrence of these progressive evolutionary changes in human breast cancers by performing correlated cell-by-cell measurements of cell DNA content, p53 protein, Her-2/neu protein, and ras protein by multiparameter flow cytometry in 56 primary tumor samples obtained at surgery. In addition, p53 allelic loss and Her-2/neu gene amplification were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization in cells from the same samples. We reasoned that if there is a specific order in which genetic changes occur, the same early changes would be found consistently in the cells with the fewest abnormalities. We reasoned further that late-developing abnormalities would not occur alone in individual cells but would almost always be found together with the early changes inherited by the same cells. By these criteria, abnormalities involving p53 generally occurred early in the course of development of invasive breast cancers, whereas ras protein overexpression was found to be a late-occurring phenomenon. Within individual tumors, cellular p53 overexpression was often observed alone in individual cells, whereas ras protein overexpression was rarely observed in the absence of p53 overexpression and/or Her-2/neu overexpression in the same cells. Furthermore, the intracellular level of each abnormally expressed protein was found to increase progressively as new abnormalities were acquired. Infiltrating ductal carcinomas exhibited characteristic phenotypic patterns in which p53 allelic loss and/or p53 protein overexpression, Her-2/neu amplification and/or overexpression, aneuploidy, and ras overexpression accumulated within individual cells. However, this pattern was not a prominent feature of lobular breast cancers. All six lobular breast cancers studied were diploid. p53 allelic loss and/or early p53 overexpression, and late ras cooverexpression in the same cells were less common in lobular breast cancers than in infiltrating ductal carcinomas. Although Her-21neu overexpression was a common finding in lobular breast cancers, Her-2/neu amplification was not observed in these tumors.","title":"Correlations among p53, Her-2/neu, and ras overexpression and aneuploidy by multiparameter flow cytometry in human breast cancer: evidence for a common phenotypic evolutionary pattern in infiltrating ductal carcinomas.","pubmedId":"10656439"}
