The author presents the results of the quantitative determination of fetal hemoglobin in 84 children suffering from acute leukemias. The quantitation of HbF was performed by the method of alkalide-naturation and values of hemoglobin A2 by celulose-acetate electrophoresis. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemias fetal hemoglobin has been increased in 59% of the patients and in acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemias in 72% of the patients. The highest values of fetal hemoglobin were about 20%. The author considers that presence of fetal hemoglobin in these diseases cannot be a marker for estimation of remission and aggravation of the disease.","title":"[Fetal hemoglobin in acute leukemias].","pubmedId":"270348"}
