The clinical manifestations were cough and sputum production, breathlessness with exertion, and crackles on chest examination. Lung function test showed a mild abnormality with mixed obstructive-restrictive and restrictive pattern respectively. The chest radiograph showed scattered small nodules and patchy densities. High resolution computer tomography showed scattered interstitial infiltrates and reticular changes in the middle and lower lung fields, but patchy ground-glass attenuation was found only in DIP. The pathological examination showed the presence of clusters of pigmented macrophages within the lumens of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and peribronchiolar alveolar spaces, with patchy submucosal and peribronchiolar infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes. Mild peribronchiolar fibrosis was found in RBILD. Compared with RBILD, the lesions of DIP were more severe and widespread. Both the patients responded favorably to glucocorticoids. They were followed for more than three years.\nRBILD could be confused with DIP in clinical manifestations, but can be separated by open lung biopsy. Considering their similarities, these two lesions may be regarded as a same disease entity.","title":"[Comparative analysis of respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease and desquamative interstitial pneumonia].","pubmedId":"15256083"}
