She was admitted to hospital because of her being in a state of confusion. One month before admission she had been diagnosed as having Graves\u0027 disease and was treated with methimazole since then. Plasma LH and FSH levels were undetectable, and their responses to LH-RH were extremely decreased in spite of undetectable levels of plasma estradiol and estriol. One year after treatment, both basal and stimulated values of LH and FSH reverted to normal as did those of TSH. Reversible suppression of gonadotropins as described herein has never been reported in cases of Graves\u0027 disease.","title":"Decreased secretion of gonadotropins in a patient with Graves\u0027 disease.","pubmedId":"8750576"}
