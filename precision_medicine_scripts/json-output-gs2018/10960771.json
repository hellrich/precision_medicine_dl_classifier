Overexpression of ARF results in cell cycle arrest in both G1 and G2. To elucidate the effect of p14ARF gene on multidrug-resistant tumor cells, we transferred a p14ARF cDNA into p53-mutated MCF-7/Adr human breast cancer cells. In this report we demonstrated for the first time that p14ARF expression was able to greatly inhibit the MCF-7/Adr cell proliferation. Furthermore, p14ARF expression resulted in decrease of MDR-1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein production, which linked to the reducing resistance of MCF-7/Adr cells to doxorubicin. These results imply that drug resistance might be effectively reversed by the wild-type p14ARF expression in human breast cancer cells.","title":"Transfer of p14ARF gene in drug-resistant human breast cancer MCF-7/Adr cells inhibits proliferation and reduces doxorubicin resistance.","pubmedId":"10960771"}
