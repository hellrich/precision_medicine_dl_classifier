In order to clarify the role of FGF in experimentally produced choroidal neovascularization, we demonstrated mRNA for FGF receptor 1 in situ hybridization. Krypton laser photocoagulation was applied to the posterior retina of colored rats to produce choroidal neovascularization experimentally. These eyes were removed at several different intervals after photocoagulation. Chorioretinal section were used for in situ hybridization. FGF receptor 1 cDNA fragment was used to make antisense and sense probes for in situ hybridization. In normal chorioretinal tissue, staining indicating the existence of FGF receptor 1 mRNA was seen in the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer. After the photocoagulation, the staining was seen in the retinal pigment epithelial cells, melanocytes in the choroid, and choroidal blood vessel wall in the photocoagulated lesions. FGF receptor 1 mRNA was expressed through the development of choroidal neovascularization, and it appears that FGF is necessary for development of choroidal neovascularization. Previous workers showed that the capillary endothelial cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells produce basic FGF in vitro. It seems that FGF effects those cells in an autocrine or paracrine manner in vivo.","title":"[Expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 in experimental choroidal neovascularization with in situ hybridization].","pubmedId":"7541933"}
