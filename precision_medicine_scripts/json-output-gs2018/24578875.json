In patients with PCa, bone metastases manifest in 100% of patients when the PSA level exceeds 100 ng/ml causing pains and posing a risk for pathological fractures [2]. We report a case of a 70-year-old male with PCa and pathological fractures of the vertebrae, in whom we observed long-term regression and an 8-year-survival while undergoing continuous therapy. As far as we know, this is the first reported case in literature with such an unexpected outcome.
