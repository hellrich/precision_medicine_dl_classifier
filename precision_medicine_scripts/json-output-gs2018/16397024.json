However, because previous reports focused the mutational search of ERBB2 primarily on lung cancers, the data on ERBB2 mutations in other types of human cancers have been largely unknown.\nHere, we did a mutational analysis of the ERBB2 kinase domain by PCR single-strand conformational polymorphism assay in gastric, colorectal, and breast carcinoma tissues.\nWe detected the ERBB2 kinase domain mutations in 9 of 180 gastric carcinomas (5.0%), in 3 of 104 colorectal carcinomas (2.9%), and in 4 of 94 breast carcinomas (4.3%). All of the detected ERBB2 mutations except for one in-frame deletion mutation were missense mutations. Of the 16 ERBB2 mutations detected, 4 affected Val777 in the exon 20 site, and 3 affected Leu755 in the exon 19 site. We simultaneously analyzed the somatic mutations of EGFR, K-RAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF genes in the 16 samples with ERBB2 mutations, and found that all of the 3 colorectal carcinoma samples with ERBB2 mutations harbored K-RAS mutations.\nThis study showed that in addition to lung adenocarcinomas, ERBB2 kinase domain mutation occurs in other common human cancers such as gastric, breast, and colorectal cancers, and suggested that alterations of ERBB2-mediated signaling pathway by ERBB2 mutations alone or together with K-RAS mutations may contribute to the development of human cancers.","title":"Somatic mutations of ERBB2 kinase domain in gastric, colorectal, and breast carcinomas.","pubmedId":"16397024"}
