Transcriptional profiling identified 917 genes that are correlated with poor patient survival after CF at P\u003c0.05 (poor prognosis signature), in which protein synthesis and DNA replication/recombination/repair functional categories are enriched. A survival risk predictor was then constructed using genes, which are included in the poor prognosis signature and are contained within identified genomic amplicons. The combined expression of three genes-MYC, EGFR and FGFR2-was an independent predictor for overall survival of 27 CF-treated patients in the validation set (adjusted P\u003d0.017), and also for survival of 40 chemotherapy-treated gastric cancer patients in a published data set (adjusted P\u003d0.026). Thus, combined expression of MYC, EGFR and FGFR2 is predictive of poor survival in CF-treated metastatic gastric cancer patients.","title":"Three-gene predictor of clinical outcome for gastric cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"21173787"}
