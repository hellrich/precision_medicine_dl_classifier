There is usually insufficient time to find a suitable unrelated donor for these patients. We report on the use of decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor as a conditioning regimen for a patient undergoing HSCT.\nOur patient was a 21-year-old male diagnosed with AML-M1 with 84Â·5% blast cells and a normal karyotype. His risk stratum was intermediate, without specific mutations of FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA and C-kit. He underwent successful haploidentical HSCT using decitabine, a conditioning regimen.\nWe present the first report of a patient with refractory AML (with 58% blast cells) treated successfully with decitabine as a conditioning regimen in haploidentical HSCT.","title":"Decitabine as a conditioning regimen in haploidentical stem cell transplantation for refractory acute myeloid leukaemia.","pubmedId":"25825260"}
