Immunohistochemically, overexpression of cyclin D1 was detected in two (25%) of eight double cancer cases and in two (11%) of 19 non-double cancer cases, respectively, the incidence showing a higher tendency in the former.\nThe results suggest that microsatellite instability may be implicated in the development of head and neck double cancers and that RER (+) phenotype may serve as a biomarker to predict the development of secondary esophageal cancer in patients with head and neck cancer.","title":"Microsatellite instability associated with primary head and neck cancers and secondary esophageal cancers.","pubmedId":"9879290"}
