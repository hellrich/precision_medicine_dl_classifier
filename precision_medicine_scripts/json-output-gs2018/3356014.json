The antibody was selected for binding to melanoma gangliosides and for reactivity with frozen tissue sections of malignant melanoma. mAb MacG1 showed reactivity in 25 of 46 melanomas examined but in only 1 of 51 nevi tested. The mAb did not react with melanoma cells but did with cytoplasmic granules and deposits associated with large dispersed cells, which were also found in some nonmelanomatous tumors and in some lymphoid tissues. Using mAbs directed against differentiation antigens these cells were identified as macrophages. In nearly all reactive tissues MacG1-positive macrophages accounted for a minority of the total macrophages. The difference in reactivity between malignant melanomas and nevi could not be explained by the variable numbers of total macrophages in these lesions. It is suggested that mAb MacG1 may define a functionally distinct subpopulation of tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Staining of cells other than macrophages was observed in some normal and malignant neural tissues. MacG1 bound to a monosialoganglioside extracted from melanoma and reacted only with NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-Cer when tested with a panel of ganglioside standards.","title":"MACG1, a mouse monoclonal antibody detecting a monosialoganglioside expressed in tumor-infiltrating macrophages.","pubmedId":"3356014"}
