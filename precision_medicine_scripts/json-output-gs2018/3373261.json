Twenty-three of 26 patients (88%) demonstrated immunoscintigraphic localization of tumor. Of 104 metastatic sites previously documented by conventional studies, 62 (60%) were identified by immunoscintigraphy. A total of 77 sites demonstrated localization of radiolabeled antibody. Fifty-four (70%) corresponded to known sites of disease; eight sites (10%) were \"discovered\" by immunoscintigraphy and subsequently confirmed by conventional studies; 15 imaged sites (20%) could not be confirmed by conventional studies. Size and location of metastasis appear to be important features that influence imaging efficiency. Tumor size (greater than or equal to 2 cm v less than 2 cm) appears to be the statistical dominant determinant. The feasibility and potential clinical use of radioimmune imaging of tumors is discussed.","title":"Clinical use of a standard kit-preparation of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody 96.5 in the diagnostic imaging of metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"3373261"}
