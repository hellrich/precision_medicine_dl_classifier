Originally identified as a tumor suppressor, it is now known that in several cancers, including malignant melanoma, CEACAM1 expression correlates with tumor progression and poor survival. Here we review the findings connecting CEACAM1 to malignant melanoma, encompassing in-vitro, in-vivo and patients-derived data. A CEACAM1-mediated mechanism used by melanoma cells to evade immune attack is described in detail. Finally, the potential value of CEACAM1 as a melanoma biomarker and therapeutic target is being discussed.","title":"CEACAM1 in malignant melanoma: a diagnostic and therapeutic target.","pubmedId":"22196267"}
