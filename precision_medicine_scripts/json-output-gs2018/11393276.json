We have previously shown that E2F-1 overexpression induces apoptosis of MDM2-overexpressing sarcoma cells, which is related to the inhibition of MDM2 expression. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effect of combined treatment of adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 and topoisomerase II inhibitors on the growth inhibition and apoptosis in human sarcoma cells. Two human sarcoma cell lines, OsACL and U2OS, were treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors (Etoposide and Adriamycin), alone or in combination with adenoviral vectors expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) or E2F-1 (Ad-E2F-1). E2F-1 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Ad-E2F-1 gene transfer at a low dose (multiplicity of infection, 2) markedly increased the sensitivity of human sarcoma cells to topoisomerase II inhibitor treatment. This cooperative effect of E2F-1 and topoisomerase II inhibitors was less marked in SAOS-2 cells (p53 and pRb null). Topoisomerase II inhibitors also cooperated with E2F-1 overexpression to enhance tumor cell killing in an in vivo model using xenografts in nude mice. When combined with Adriamycin or Etoposide, E2F-1 adenovirus therapy resulted in approximately 95% and 85% decrease in tumor size, respectively, compared to controls (P\u003c.05). These results suggest a new chemosensitization strategy that is effective in MDM2-overexpressing tumors and may have clinical utility.","title":"Additive effect of adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 gene transfer and topoisomerase II inhibitors on apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells.","pubmedId":"11393276"}
