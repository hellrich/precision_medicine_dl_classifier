The aim of this study was to determine whether SNP309 is associated with susceptibility to gastric carcinoma and its prognosis.\nIn a case-control study including 438 controls and 410 patients with sporadic gastric carcinoma, MDM2 SNP309 was genotyped. Serum pepsinogens (PGs) I and II were measured in 438 control subjects and 253 cases selected from 410 patients. Tumor tissue was immunostained with p53 and examined for mutations in exons 5 to 8 of p53 using polymerase chain reaction-based single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing.\nThe risk of overall gastric carcinoma for SNP309 (G/G) was significantly increased when compared with T carriers (P \u003d .039), especially carcinomas with extragastric tumors (P \u003d .005), carcinoma with severe atrophic gastritis positive for PG assay (PG I level \u003c 70 ng/mL and PG I/II \u003c 3.0; P \u003d .005), antral carcinoma (P \u003d .020), intestinal-type carcinoma (P \u003d .023), p53-immunopositive carcinoma (P \u003d .007), and carcinoma with p53 mutations (P \u003d .007). No significant difference in age at diagnosis was observed among genotypes. SNP309 (G/G) was an independent marker of poor overall survival in advanced carcinoma (hazard ratio, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.22 to 8.20; P \u003d .018).\nThis study provides evidence supporting the association of SNP309 with gastric carcinogenesis via p53 tumor suppressor pathway, extragastric tumorigenesis, and poor prognosis.","title":"MDM2 promoter polymorphism is associated with both an increased susceptibility to gastric carcinoma and poor prognosis.","pubmedId":"16983111"}
