It is suggested that dual inhibition of EGFR and c-Met may overcome or delay emergence of this resistance. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter, open-label, single arm Phase II combining erlotinib and a c-Met inhibitor tivantinib, in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients with EGFR-TKI resistance. Methods:  NSCLC patients who developed progressive disease during their immediately previous treatment with either erlotinib or gefitinib were enrolled. Fresh tumor biopsy was mandatory prior to starting the combination. All patients received daily oral erlotinib and tivantinib, until discontinuation criteria were met. Tumor response was evaluated by the independent radiological committee. The biopsy specimens were used for a comprehensive biomarker analysis, such as IHC assay of c-Met and HGF, and for multiplex mutation analysis (LungCarta Panel) of lung cancer associate genes including KRAS, c-MET, PTEN, EGFR and TP53. Plasma concentration of soluble c-Met and 8 angiogenic cytokines were also determined by ELISA and Luminex assay, respectively. Results:  Forty-five patients were treated. The Table below shows objective response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) in the overall population, and in a subpopulation defined by c-Met expression or resistance mutations in EGFR (i.e. T790M or Exon 20 ins). Most of AEs were similar to the previous trials. Conclusions:  In patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC with EGFR-TKI resistance, erlotinib/tivantinib combination therapy may be beneficial to those with high c-Met expression or in those without resistance mutations in EGFR. The more detailed multivariate analyses regarding biomarkers will also be reported.
