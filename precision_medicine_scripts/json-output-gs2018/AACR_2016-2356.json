Our innovative approach is to use the property of erythrocytes to be naturally phagocytosed by APC when senescent. Indeed, TA can be encapsulated into erythrocytes that will be used as carrier to specifically deliver the TA to APC, which will ensure their degradation and presentation to T cells.Materials and Methods: The proof of concept was established with Ovalbumin (OVA), tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP2 (melanoma TA) and prostate specific antigen (PSA, prostate TA). These TA were encapsulated into erythrocytes by a hypotonic lysis process. To stimulate the erythrophagocytosis by APC, the membranes of erythrocytes were coated with antibodies. Then, erythrocytes containing TA were intravenously injected to mice concomitantly with Poly(I:C) adjuvant. The CTL response was analyzed by IFN ELISPOT and in vivo lysis of TA-expressing target cells injected to immunized mice. Humoral response was assessed by the determination of TA-specific immunoglobulin titer in mouse serum.Results: All TA were efficiently encapsulated in erythrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. A strong T-cell response was induced after 2 injections of TA encapsulated in erythrocytes: 2g of OVA and 20g of TRP2 induced the in vivo lysis of 97% and 96% of TA-target cells, respectively. By comparison, injections of free antigen induced less than 5% of lysis. Furthermore, a significant number of TA-specific IFN-secreting cells was generated (1585 and 286 cells / 106 cells for TRP2 and PSA, respectively) compared to the free TA (\u003c 80 cells / 106 cells for both TA). In addition, we established a dose-dependent PSA-specific humoral response. Finally, a significant delay of tumor growth was obtained in mice more than twenty days after the subcutaneous implantation of EG7-OVA or B16F10 (melanoma) tumor cell lines, compared to injections with free antigen or control vehicle.Conclusion: The use of erythrocytes as TA carrier to specifically deliver antigen to APC and induce efficient immune response against tumor can be a very promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy.","title":"Erythrocytes used as tumor antigen delivery system to target antigen-presenting cells embody an innovative approach for in situ cancer immunotherapy","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2356"}
