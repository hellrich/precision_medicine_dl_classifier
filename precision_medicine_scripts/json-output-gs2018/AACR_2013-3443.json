CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance 1, XPO1) is the exclusive exporter of many TSPs. We hypothesized that CRM1 inhibition can be used as a therapeutic target in melanoma. The growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of KPT-185, KPT-276 and KPT-330, potent, small molecule, selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) were evaluated in a panel of human metastatic melanoma cell lines using an MTS assay and Annexin V/PI staining, respectively. The weak CRM1 inhibitor, KPT-185 trans-isomer, and DMSO vehicle were controls in all assays. CRM1 protein was expressed in melanoma cell lines regardless of molecular profile (BRAF, NRAS, TP53) as determined by immunoblot. SINEs inhibited cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner and induced apoptosis at nanomolar concentrations (range\u003d139.7nM - 2.41M). Both BRAF wild type (WT) and BRAF V600E mutant lines were sensitive to apoptosis by SINE, but BRAF V600E lines had an 8.8-fold lower IC50s as compared to BRAF (WT) lines (p\u003d0.018). The cytostatic and pro-apoptotic effects of CRM1 inhibition were associated with nuclear accumulation of p53, and p21 induction in A375 and CHL-1 melanoma cell lines with functional p53 at time points prior to apoptosis, while pERK accumulated in melanoma cells regardless of p53 status. In pharmacokinetic studies in mice, KPT-276 and KPT-330 showed \u003e50% oral bioavailability with Cmax \u003e5M. Mice bearing either A375 (BRAF V600E) or CHL-1 (BRAF WT) melanoma xenografts were given KPT-276 or KPT-330 SINE by oral gavage. A375 xenografts (p\u003c0.0001 for both drugs) and CHL-1 xenografts (p\u003d0.0087 and 0.0002 respectively) showed significant growth inhibition as compared to vehicle-treated controls with good tolerability. KPT-330 is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancers including melanoma as the first orally bioavailable, SINE CRM1 antagonist.","title":"Novel small molecule CRM1 inhibitors induce nuclear accumulation of p53, phosphorylated ERK and apoptosis in human melanoma cells.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-3443"}
