Here we investigate whether this immunogenic chemotherapy can be potentiated by combination with the immune stimulatory TLR9 agonist CpG-1826. CpG-1826 treatment of GL261 gliomas implanted in immune competent mice induced tumor growth delay associated with increased tumor recruitment of macrophages and B cells. Anti-tumor responses varied between individuals, with CpG-1826 inducing robust tumor growth delay in ~50% of treated mice. Both high and low CpG-1826-responsive mice showed striking improvements when CpG-1826 was combined with cyclophosphamide treatment. Tumor-associated macrophages, B cells, dendritic cells, and cytotoxic T cells were increased, T regulatory cells were not induced, and long-term GL261 glioma regression with immune memory was achieved when CpG-1826 was combined with either single cyclophosphamide dosing (90 mg/kg) or metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment (two cycles at 45 mg/kg, spaced 12-days apart). B16F10 melanoma, a low immunogenic tumor model, also showed enhanced immune and anti-tumor responses to cyclophosphamide/CpG-1826 chemoimmunotherapy, but unlike GL261 tumors, did not regress. TLR9-based immunotherapy can thus be effectively combined with immunogenic cyclophosphamide treatment to enhance immune-based anti-tumor responses, even in poorly immunogenic cancer models.","title":"CpG-1826 immunotherapy potentiates chemotherapeutic and anti-tumor immune responses to metronomic cyclophosphamide in a preclinical glioma model.","pubmedId":"26655275"}
