Bone metastasis is sometimes symptomatic and causes severe pain or paralysis which impairs quality of life. If the patients who are at higher risk of SREs are identified, monitoring of bone metastases might be performed more effectively, which would lead to prevention of significant morbidity. Then, we analyzed the associated factors of skeletal related events in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in Shikoku Cancer Center (Matsuyama, Japan). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of NSCLC patients with bone metastasis at initial diagnosis or during the treatment in our institute between January 2011 and February 2015. We extracted the following factors; age, sex, EGFR mutation status, SREs at initial bone metastasis diagnosis, serum LDH and ALP level, the number of bone metastasis, the number of vertebral metastasis, and the other distant metastasis. We performed univariate analyses are conducted with log-rank tests and multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazard model. Results: Total 181 patients (pts) were analyzed. Male/Female \u003d 94/87, Median age \u003d 66 years old (Range, 25-88). Adenocarcinoma/Squamous cell carcinoma/Large cell carcinoma \u003d 165/14/2. Zoledronic acid and/or denosumab were administrated in 108 pts for bone metastasis. SREs were experienced in total 84 pts (46%). SREs was observed in 50 pts (28%, 60 sites) and 43 pts (24%, 47 sites) at bone metastasis initial diagnosis and during the treatment, respectively. 8 pts, 3 pts, and 1 pt experienced SRE twice, three and four times, respectively. Total 84 pts received the palliative irradiation and 5 pts received surgery. The SREs free survival was 76% and 55% at 1year and 2-year, respectively. The associated factors of SREs were the presence of EGFR mutation and serum LDH level (  300U/L) in univariate and multivariate analysis. The hazard ratios were 2.87 (95%C.I. 1.39-5.94, p \u003d 0.004) in EGFR mutation and 2.95 (95% C.I. 1.54-5.64, p \u003d 0.001) in serum LDH (  300U/L), respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates EGFR mutation and serum LDH (  300U/L) level are independent risk factors for the prediction of SREs.","title":"The associated factors of skeletal related events in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_167924-176"}
