The novel strategy of treating malignant gliomas with a ketogenic diet has been tested in animal models with promising results.  To evaluate the applicability of these findings to human patients we tested the hypothesis that high grade human gliomas may lack or have decreased expression of mitochondrial enzymes that are important for metabolizing ketones.  Methods:  We evaluated the expression of 2 key mitochondrial enzymes involved in ketone metabolism in 22 patients (17 males and 5 females, mean age 55,range 30-85) with either glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) or anaplastic glioma (WHO grade III) (Table). Immunohistochemistry reactions were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from brain biopsies, using antibodies raised against succinyl CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase (OXCT1) and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1). Immunoreactivities were graded using a semi-quantitative scale based on the percentage of positive cells: negative (NEG)  5%; intermediate (INT) 5-20%; and positive (POS) more than 20%. Focal non-neoplastic normal brain tissue present within the specimens expressed both enzymes and served as an internal positive control.  Results:  Either absent or marked decreased expression of OXCT1 and BDH1 were observed in most GBM and anaplastic glioma.   Concordance for absent or marked decrease expression of both OXCT1 and BDH1 was observed in 14 of the 17 (82%) GBMs, and 1 of 5 (20%) anaplastic gliomas.  Conclusions:  These data support the rationale for a pilot clinical study investigating the therapeutic utility of a ketogenic diet in selected glioma patients.  Malignant gliomas with diminished expression of key enzymes (e.g., OXCT1, BDH1) may benefit from the ketogenic diet therapy, whereas those with positive expression of these enzymes likely will not.NOXCT1BDH1NEGINTPOSNEGINTPOSGBM1710431160Anaplastic glioma5014131","title":"Impaired expression of ketone metabolizing enzymes in malignant gliomas: Implication for ketogenic diet therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_95195-114"}
