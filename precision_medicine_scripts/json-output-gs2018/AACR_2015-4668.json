It has been traditionally characterized by activation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, as well as cell cycle disruption. In recent years, whole-genome and exome sequencing studies have identified several new genes associated with melanomagenesis. However, a comprehensive understanding of concurrent, and mutually exclusive, mutations in tumors is currently lacking. Using a custom targeted capture of 108 genes previously implicated in melanoma pathogenesis, massively parallel sequencing was performed on 94 human melanoma cell lines, 67 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and 5 cell lines made from PDX, all untreated. Samples were then clustered into groups based on deleterious mutations. 83% of samples had deleterious mutations in the MAPK signaling pathway, including 92 high activity BRAF (55%), 35 RAS codon 61 (21%), 7 with multiple mutations (e.g. low activity BRAF/RAS codons 12/13) (4%) and 10 NF1 (6%) mutated samples. Likely deleterious NF1 mutations were found in several BRAF or NRAS-mutated samples. PI3K pathway mutations were found in 10% of samples, predominantly associated with BRAF mutations. TP53 mutations were found in 24% of samples and were associated with all MAPK signaling mutations. Mutations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A/1B, ARID2, TRRAP, and BAP1) were mutually exclusive with each other and primarily found in tumors with high activity BRAF or NRAS mutations. The majority of BRAF or RAS-mutated samples with a mutation in a chromatin remodeling gene lacked mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and PI3K signaling genes; however, 100% of deleterious, or likely deleterious, NF1-mutated samples with a chromatin remodeling gene mutation harbored additional mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and/or PI3K signaling genes. Of particular interest, five of the 10 NF1-mutated samples (50%) lacked BRAF, RAS, and MEK1/2 mutations but harbored likely deleterious mutations in MAP3K5 or MAP3K9, suggesting the potential involvement of the JNK signal transduction pathway in this particular cohort. Only 4% of samples did not have a deleterious mutation in any of the genes on the panel. These data reveal novel insights into the genetics of melanomas lacking a canonical BRAF V600 mutation. Functional assays are needed to confirm the biological relevance of likely deleterious mutations, which will further facilitate a more thorough classification of CM subsets.","title":"Targeted, massively parallel sequencing identifies novel genetic subsets of cutaneous melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4668"}
