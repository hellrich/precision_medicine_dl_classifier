We document the immunophenotype, incidence of axillary metastases, and rate of recurrence in a well-defined case series.\nWe reviewed 83 consecutive patients with MIBC from 1997 to 2005. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) receptor status were assessed. The cumulative incidence of local recurrence (LR) and nodal/distant recurrence was calculated. Predictors of recurrence were identified and effect estimates determined.\nFifty-two patients (63%) underwent breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and 31 (37%) underwent mastectomy. Sixty-one percent had ER-positive disease and 49% had HER-2/neu-positive disease. Three (4%) of 68 patients with sentinel node mapping or axillary dissection had single node micrometastases, and none had macrometastases or multiple nodes involved. Median follow-up was 6.4 years, with 6 LRs, 2 regional nodal recurrences, and 2 concurrent local/distant recurrences. The 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence (local, nodal, or distant) was 5.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-13.4) for all patients, and among BCT patients, the 5-year cumulative incidence of LR was 4.2% (95% CI 0.7-12.7). HER-2/neu overexpression was not associated with recurrence (P \u003d 0.46). Close/positive margins (â‰¤2 mm) were significantly associated with an increased risk of LR after BCT or mastectomy (hazard ratio 8.8; 95% CI 1.6-48.8; P \u003d 0.003).\nMIBC has a favorable prognosis, and HER-2/neu overexpression, although highly prevalent, is not significantly associated with recurrence. Axillary metastases at diagnosis are small and infrequent. The cumulative incidence of LR after BCT is acceptable; however, our data confirm that negative margins (\u003e2 mm) are required for optimal BCT outcomes.","title":"Microinvasive breast cancer: ER, PR, and HER-2/neu status and clinical outcomes after breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy.","pubmedId":"22956068"}
