This feature appears late in the course of the disease as small yellow nodules that progressively increase in number and gradually become dark brown. The differential diagnosis of multiple iris nodules includes neurofibromatosis, melanomas, inflammatory nodules, and developmental anomalies such as iridocorneal dysgenesis.","title":"Iris nodules in essential iris atrophy.","pubmedId":"818989"}
