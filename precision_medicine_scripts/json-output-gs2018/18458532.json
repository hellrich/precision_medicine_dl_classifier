Since loss of p53 tumor suppressor function or overexpression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene can decrease susceptibility to some cancer therapies, we now investigated the effect of FNQ against genetically matched C8161 melanoma cell lines transduced to express unequal levels of Bcl-2, or engineered to harbour a functional wt p53 for comparison with dominant-negative mutant p53 R175H. Cells with differing p53 genotype showed susceptibility to FNQ. However, this response was attenuated in those overexpressing mutant p53, although a brief p53 induction was early seen in FNQ-treated wt p53 cells. Cells susceptible to FNQ showed cleavage of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, sustained activation of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (p-JNK), and apoptosis-associated PARP fragmentation, all of which were counteracted in bcl-2 overexpressing cells. Suppression of JNK activation with the specific inhibitor, SP600125 also prevented FNQ-mediated cell death. Our data suggests that Bcl-2, persistent JNK phosphorylation and cleavage of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 are key events controlling susceptibility to FNQ.","title":"Mcl-1 cleavage and sustained phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase mediate melanoma apoptosis induced by 2-acetyl furanonaphthoquinone: roles of Bcl-2 and p53.","pubmedId":"18458532"}
