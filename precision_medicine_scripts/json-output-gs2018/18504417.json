In this report, we present a case of congenital glioblastoma with complicated management course. A literature review of previously reported cases is included to illustrate the epidemiology and natural history of this disease. A 9-month-old male infant developed acute lethargy, hemiparesis and unilaterally dilated pupil. Imaging studies revealed a large hemispheric tumor, resulting in significant midline shift suggestive of impending herniation. Emergent tumor cystic fluid drainage was performed at initial presentation. A frontotemporoparietal craniotomy was performed on the following day to attempt a gross total resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of oral temozolomide was administered. The patient eventually succumbed 4 months later due to aggressive tumor progression. Congenital glioblastoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of infants with large intracranial tumors. Although surgical intervention may increase survival, the overall outcome remains poor despite maximal multimodal treatment.","title":"Congenital glioblastoma multiforme: case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"18504417"}
