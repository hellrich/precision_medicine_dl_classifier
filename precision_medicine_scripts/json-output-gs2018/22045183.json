Our study aimed to determine in melanoma metastases a gene expression profile associated with patient survival, and to identify and validate marker(s) of poor clinical outcome.\nSkin and lymph node metastases from melanoma patients (training population) were used to identify candidate prognostic marker(s) based on DNA microarray analysis. Additional skin metastases (validation population) were used to assess the prognostic value of the first ranked gene by real-time PCR.\nWe performed microarray analysis in the training population and generated a list of 278 probe sets associated with a shorter survival. We used the first ranked gene, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), further measured its expression in the validation population by real-time PCR and found it to be significantly correlated with distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS) and Breslow thickness. We also found that it was fairly well conserved in the course of the disease regardless of the delay to metastasis occurrence. Finally, although Tyrp1 protein (immunohistochemistry (IHC)) was only detected in about half of the samples, we showed that its expression also correlated with Breslow thickness.\nOur data indicate that TYRP1 mRNA expression level, at least in skin metastases, is a prognostic marker for melanoma, and is particularly useful when prognostic pathology parameters at the primary lesion are lacking. Its conserved expression further supports its use as a target for therapy.","title":"TYRP1 mRNA expression in melanoma metastases correlates with clinical outcome.","pubmedId":"22045183"}
