MET is activated in several tumour types and may be a promising therapeutic target.\nTo evaluate the role of MET in SCLC, MET gene status and protein expression were evaluated in a panel of SCLC cell lines. The MET inhibitor PHA-665752 was used to study effects of pathway inhibition in basal and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-stimulated conditions. Immunohistochemistry for MET and p-MET was performed in human SCLC samples and association with outcome was assessed.\nIn MET mutant SCLC cells, HGF induced MET phosphorylation, increased proliferation, invasiveness and clonogenic growth. PHA-665752 blocked MET phosphorylation and counteracted HGF-induced effects. In clinical samples, total MET and p-MET overexpression were detected in 54% and 43% SCLC tumours (n \u003d 77), respectively. MET phosphorylation was associated with poor median overall survival (132 days) vs p-MET negative cases (287 days) (P \u003c 0.001). Phospho-MET retained its prognostic value in a multivariate analysis.\nMET activation resulted in a more aggressive phenotype in MET mutant SCLC cells and its inhibition by PHA-665752 reversed this phenotype. In patients with SCLC, MET activation was associated with worse prognosis, suggesting a role in the adverse clinical behaviour in this disease.","title":"MET phosphorylation predicts poor outcome in small cell lung carcinoma and its inhibition blocks HGF-induced effects in MET mutant cell lines.","pubmedId":"21847116"}
