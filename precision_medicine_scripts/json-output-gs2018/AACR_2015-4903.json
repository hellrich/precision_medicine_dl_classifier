PC-3 is highly sensitive to A1-R. Numerous genes involved in diverse cellular processes, including apoptosis, necrotic cell death, neutrophil chemotaxis and innate immunity were significantly up-regulated by A1-R bacterial infection. Such up-regulated genes include TNF-a, Fos and JUN which are involved in cell death and IL-1A and CXCL which are involved in neutrophil chemotaxes. Knowledge of the up-regulated gene profile will be exploited for enhancing prostate tumor targeting by A1-R.Keywords: Salmonella typhimurium A1-R, human prostate cancer, microarray, apoptosis, necrotic cell death, neutrophil chemotaxis, tumor-targeting.","title":"Microarray gene expression analysis of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells targeted by Salmonella typhimurium A1-R","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4903"}
