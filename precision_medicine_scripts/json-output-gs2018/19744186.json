Lately, p63 antibody has been used for distinguishing squamous cell carcinoma from SCLC and adenocarcinoma. We present an analysis of p63 expression in cytological smears from 100 bronchial lavage specimens comprising 51 cases of SCLC and 49 cases of NSCLC.\nA single Papanicolaou-stained conventional smear was de-stained and re-fixed with cold acetone and methanol for immunocytochemical staining with p63 antibody. Staining results were graded as 0 (nil), 1+ (focal), 2+ (moderate, diffuse) and 3+ (strong, diffuse).\nOut of 100 cases, 21 were cytologically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma. Twenty of these showed 2+ or 3+ p63 positivity, whereas one, which was adenocarcinoma on histology, showed 1+ staining. Of seven cases cytologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, six showed no p63 staining, whereas one, which was squamous cell carcinoma on histology, showed 1+ staining. All 48 cases cytologically diagnosed as SCLC were confirmed as such on histology and showed no p63 staining. Four cases were cytologically designated as poorly differentiated carcinomas, of which three showed no p63 staining and one showed 3+ staining. The former three were found to be SCLC on histology while the latter was squamous cell carcinoma. The remaining 20 cases were cytologically designated as NSCLC. Of these, eight showed no p63 staining, whereas 10 showed 1+ and two showed 2+ staining. The former eight were adenocarcinoma on histology and the latter two were squamous cell carcinoma. The 10 cases that showed 1+ p63 staining were adenocarcinomas (n \u003d 5), squamous cell carcinoma (n \u003d 4) and NSCLC, not otherwise specified (n \u003d 1). Positive staining was seen in normal basal cells, which acted as an internal control. Overall sensitivity of p63 for squamous cell carcinoma was 100% and specificity was 90.4%.\np63 immunostaining on processed cytology smears can be used to help identify squamous cell carcinoma. Its diffuse expression was specific for squamous cell carcinoma while focal staining was also seen in adenocarcinoma.","title":"The use of p63 as an effective immunomarker in the diagnosis of pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas on de-stained bronchial lavage cytological smears.","pubmedId":"19744186"}
