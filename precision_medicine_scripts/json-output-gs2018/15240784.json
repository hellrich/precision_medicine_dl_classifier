RET oncogenes arise through sporadic and inherited gene mutations and are involved in the etiopathogenesis of medullary thyroid carcinoma, a cancer that responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or MEN2 syndromes.\nWe investigated the cellular effects of RPI-1, a novel 2-indolinone Ret tyrosine kinase inhibitor on cells that express RET C634 oncogenic mutants common in the MEN2A syndrome: NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with RET(C634R) and human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells that express endogenous RET(C634W). RPI-1 antiproliferative activity was determined by cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth assays. Expression and phosphorylation of Ret and of proteins involved in downstream signaling pathways were examined by immunoblotting. Antitumor activity of oral RPI-1 treatment was tested by using two dosing levels in nude mice bearing subcutaneous TT xenograft tumors. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nThe RPI-1 IC50 value for cell proliferation was 3.6 microM (95% confidence interval [CI] \u003d 1.8 to 5.4 microM) in NIH3T3 cells expressing the Ret mutant compared with 16 microM (95% CI \u003d 12.3 to 19.7 microM) in non-transfected NIH3T3 cells, and that for colony formation in soft agar was 2.4 microM (95% CI \u003d 0.8 to 4.0 microM) and 26 microM (95% CI \u003d 17 to 35 microM) in RET mutant-transfected and H-RAS-transfected NIH3T3 cells, respectively. In NIH3T3 cells expressing the Ret mutant, Ret protein and tyrosine phosphorylation were undetectable after 24 hours of RPI-1 treatment. In TT cells, RPI-1 inhibited proliferation, Ret tyrosine phosphorylation, Ret protein expression, and the activation of PLCgamma, ERKs and AKT. In mice, oral daily RPI-1 treatment inhibited the tumor growth of TT xenografts by 81% (P\u003c.001 versus control mice) and reduced the plasma levels of the specific biomarker calcitonin (P \u003d.01 versus control mice). Twenty-five percent of RPI-1-treated mice were tumor-free.\nRet oncoproteins represent exploitable targets for therapeutic intervention in MEN2A-associated medullary thyroid carcinoma. The antitumor efficacy and oral bioavailability of RPI-1 support its therapeutic potential.","title":"Cellular effects and antitumor activity of RET inhibitor RPI-1 on MEN2A-associated medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"15240784"}
