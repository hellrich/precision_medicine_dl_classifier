We hypothesize combined treatment with inhibitors of MEK1/2 plus another cancer pathway would provide a more durable tumor response for MEK1/2 driven cancers. To test this we examined in vitro synergy between MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901 and inhibitors to eleven common cancer pathways using MEK1/2-driven melanoma cell lines and canine hemangiosarcoma cell isolates. Combination indices (CI) were calculated following the methods of Chou and Talalay (Chou and Talalay, 1984). Of the combinations tested, tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors sorafenib and dasatinib, and the dual PI3 kinase and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin showed synergy (CI\u003c0.7) with PD0325901. To validate these results we subsequently tested synergy for PD0325901 plus sorafenib in vivo using mouse xenograft models for melanoma and canine angiosarcoma. We conclude dual inhibition of MEK1/2 and receptor tyrosine kinases or mTOR signaling are useful strategies to treat MEK1/2 dependent cancers.","title":"Improved response of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1/2-dependent tumors using combination drug therapy.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-3270"}
