The patient subsequently presented with a contralateral brain mass that was also diagnosed as adenoid cystic carcinoma. To our knowledge, contralateral metastasis to the brain of a patient with an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the ceruminous glands has not been reported previously. This rare neoplasm should be considered in the differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinomas metastatic to the central nervous system in patients with occult malignant neoplasms.","title":"Ceruminous gland adenoid cystic carcinoma with contralateral metastasis to the brain.","pubmedId":"11800656"}
