Aberrant HDAC6 overexpression was observed in a subset of human gastric cancer cells. HDAC6 knockdown caused the significant inhibition of gastric cancer cell growth without affecting the transition of cell cycles or the processing of cell death. We demonstrate that an increase in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling through decreased EGFR degradation was mediated by HDAC6 in gastric carcinogenesis. These results establish a molecular mechanism responsible for oncogenic HDAC6, explaining how EGFR signaling induced by the growth factor is sustained during the malignant progression of gastric cancer.
