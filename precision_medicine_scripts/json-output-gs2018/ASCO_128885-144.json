Potential mechanisms for the effect of obesity include elevated blood levels of estrogen in obese patients, which stimulate estrogen receptors on hormone sensitive tumors. Thyroid cancers, which, like breast and ovarian cancer show a female predominance, may also be estrogen sensitive. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that obese women would have more aggressive thyroid tumors, which would correlate with estrogen receptor (ER) status. Methods:  We enrolled 164 patients who underwent partial or total thyroidectomy between 2010-2012. Data collected included gender, body mass index, and pathology, including tumor type, TNM stage and MACIS staging criteria. Banked tumor samples from severely obese patients, as well as non-obese age and MACIS-matched controls underwent immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate for ER status. After normality testing, parametric data was compared using unpaired t-tests and nonparametric data using Mann-Whitney U tests.  Results:  Mean age at surgery was 49 years (range 13-84 years), mean BMI 30 (range 17-51) and mean MACIS score for all patients with malignant disease (n\u003d79) was 4.98 (range 3.10-10.27).  86% of patients were female and the most common tumor type was papillary. In the largest subgroup of patients, females with papillary cancer (n\u003d 59), severely obese patients (n\u003d 10), defined as BMI \u003e 35, had significantly larger tumors than thinner patients, defined as BMI \u003c 35. Median tumor size in the severely obese patients was 2.95cm, and 1.5cm in the thinner patients (p \u003c 0.05). Mean age was not significantly different in the severely obese and thinner patient groups, suggesting that diagnosis was not delayed in the severely obese cohort. IHC revealed that all tumor samples were ER positive.  Conclusions:  This data supports the view that obesity is a risk factor for tumor growth in thyroid cancer. Although in our small patient sample we did not see a significant difference in ER status between obese and non-obese patients, ER positivity appears to be widespread in papillary tumors and may contribute to oncogenesis. Further investigation will be required to delineate the biochemical pathways responsible for this phenomenon.","title":"Obesity and thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_128885-144"}
