Different studies have reported conflicting results, stating the importance of the length, position and number of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) for prognostic significance. In the present study, FLT3-ITD mutations were found in 51 (23%) of 218 patients with AML. Using sequence analysis we categorized ITD integration sites according to functional regions of the FLT3 receptor. Median ITD size was 61 bp. The insertion site was strongly correlated with ITD size: more C-terminal located inserted fragments were significantly bigger. Our data confirm that FLT3-ITD mutations identify a subset of young patients with AML with normal cytogenetics but with inferior outcome. Patients with AML with mutation localization outside the juxtamembrane domain showed no correlation with worse prognosis. A high mutant/wild-type ratio appears to have a major impact on the prognostic relevance.","title":"Molecular analysis of different FLT3-ITD mutations in acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"22721497"}
