Further we want to perform mutation analysis of KIT-positive adenoid cystic carcinomas.\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from 73 patients with parotid gland carcinomas were used for the study. The sections were stained with both KIT and EGFR polyclonal antibodies. Twelve KIT-positive adenoid cystic carcinomas were examined for c-kit mutation in codon 816.\nOf all carcinomas 25% were KIT-positive and 79% were EGFR-positive. Ninety-two percentage of the adenoid cystic carcinomas were KIT-positive. None of the adenoid cystic carcinomas had mutations in codon 816 of the c-kit gene.\nNeither KIT- nor EGFR-expression seem to harbour significant prognostic information. Adenoid cystic carcinomas express KIT, but no mutations in codon 816 of the c-kit gene were identified.","title":"Parotid carcinoma: expression of kit protein and epidermal growth factor receptor.","pubmedId":"16630292"}
