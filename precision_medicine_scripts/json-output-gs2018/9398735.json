Mutations in one of five cysteine residues in the extracellular domain have been found in over 95% of families with MEN 2A and 88% of families with FMTC. In MEN 2B patients, a specific mutation at codon 918, substituting a threonine for a methionine, has been found in 95% of cases. In FMTC, in addition to the mutations of the extracellular cysteines, three intracellular base pair changes have been reported at codons 768 and 804. Here we describe a novel intracellular mutation in exon 15 of the ret gene that leads to the substitution of an alanine for a serine at codon 891 in a family with medullary thyroid carcinoma. This amino acid change may be important in determining substrate specificity or, alternatively, may play a role in ATP binding.","title":"A novel point mutation in the intracellular domain of the ret protooncogene in a family with medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"9398735"}
