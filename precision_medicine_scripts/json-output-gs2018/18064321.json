It was the objective of this study to evaluate whether the physiological increase in serum estradiol concentration during the normal menstrual cycle affects the individual\u0027s sensitivity to APC. Seventy-two women with normal menstrual cycles were included in the study. Blood samples for analysis of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4) and APC resistance were drawn at two time points of the menstrual cycle (day 3-5 and day 22-25). Two methods of measuring APC resistance were used: the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based assay and the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP)-based APC resistance test. Independent of the method used, no changes in APC resistance were found, even though the E2 concentration increased significantly between the two menstrual phases. No correlations between E2 levels and APC resistance, P4 levels and APC resistance or changes in E2 concentrations and changes in APC resistance were detected. Ten women were carriers of the factor V(Leiden) mutation. Their baseline APC resistance was increased, but their response to elevated E2 during the menstrual cycle did not differ from that of non-carriers. In conclusion, our observations suggest that physiological differences in serum levels of estradiol and progesterone between the early follicular and the luteal phase in a normal menstrual cycle do not have any significant impact on the individual\u0027s sensitivity to APC.","title":"APC resistance during the normal menstrual cycle.","pubmedId":"18064321"}
