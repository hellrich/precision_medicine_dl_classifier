The difference was statistically significant (P \u003c 0.05).\nThe consistency of the c-MET gene amplification in peripheral blood and tissue is high. c-MET gene amplification of peripheral blood could be used for clinical diagnosis and treatment in cases when tissue specimen is hard to get.","title":"A comparison of consistency of detecting c-MET gene amplification in peripheral blood and tumor tissue of nonsmall cell lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"26323927"}
