This consideration makes it imperative to dissect further the biological mechanisms of disease, in order to selectively implement an hitherto unsatisfactory success rate. The recognition of discrete ALL subtypes (some of which deserve specific therapeutic approaches, like T-lineage ALL (T-ALL) and mature B-lineage ALL (B-ALL)) is possible through an accurate combination of cytomorphology, immunophenotytpe and cytogenetic assays and has been a major result of clinical research studies conducted over the past 20 years. Two-three major prognostic groups are now easily identifiable, with a survival probability ranging from \u003c10 to 20% (Philadelphia-positive ALL) to about 50-60% (low-risk T-ALL and selected patients with B-lineage ALL). These issues are extensively reviewed and form the basis of current knowledge. The second major point relates to the emerging importance of studies that reveal a dysregulated gene activity and its clinical counterpart. It is now clear that prognostication is a complex matter ranging from patient-related issues to cytogenetics to molecular biology, including the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) and possibly gene array tests. On these bases, the role of a correct, highly personalised therapeutic choice will soon become fundamental. Therapeutic progress may be obtainable through a careful integration of chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and the new targeted treatments with highly specific metabolic inhibitors and humanised monoclonal antibodies.","title":"Adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","pubmedId":"15182827"}
