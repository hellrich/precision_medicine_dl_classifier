The main clinical feature includes lymphadenopathy with mediastinal sparing. In the extranodal disease, which occurs in approximately half of the cases, the skin is the most common site; bone marrow, lung and central nervous system are generally not involved. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is more common among young people, in whom the prognosis is more favorable. Primary anaplastic large cell lymphoma of the lung is a rare clinical entity. Its clinical expression is similar to a high grade malignant lymphoma, and in most cases the diagnosis is made in advanced stages. We present a pediatric case with ALK-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma of the lung.","title":"[ALK-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma of the lung.
