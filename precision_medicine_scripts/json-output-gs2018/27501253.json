Moreover, we investigated the effect of NPM1 in tumor proliferation and apoptosis of salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC).\nNPM1 expression was examined in 74 specimens of SACC and 31 non-cancerous epithelium adjacent to carcinoma (NCEAC) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RNA interference technology was used to silence NPM1 expression in SACC cells. We used transwell culture assay, cell counting kit-8 tests, and colony formation assay to test the proliferation, cisplatin resistance, migration, and invasiveness of SACC cells.\nThe nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of NPM1 in SACC tissue was overexpressed and was tightly linked to perineural invasion and lymph node metastasis. The downregulation of NPM1 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in SACC cells. Knockdown of NPM1 expression had no effect on chemoresistance migration, or invasiveness.\nNPM1 may play an important role in tumor progress in SACC and is a potential biomarker for SACC.","title":"Downregulation of nucleophosmin expression inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"27501253"}
