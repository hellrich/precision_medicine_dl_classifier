All DNA samples were obtained from paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissue blocks.\nhTERT promoter methylation was found with a relatively high frequency (52%). Promoter methylation of p16, TIMP3, RASSF1, RARB, FHIT and APC was a rare event. For none of these genes did promoter methylation exceed 15% of tumour samples, and, for some genes (FHIT and APC), no methylation was found at all. Furthermore, promoter methylation was absent in 39% (9/23) of cases. In only 22% (5/23) of cases was hypermethylation of at least two promoters observed.\nPromoter methylation of hTERT is a regular event in uveal melanoma. Hypermethylation of the other genes studied does not seem to be an essential element in the development of this tumour. As promoter methylation of APC, RASSF1 and RARB is often observed in cutaneous melanoma, these results suggest that different epigenetic events occur in the development of cutaneous and uveal melanoma.","title":"Methylation of CpG island promoters in uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"18211945"}
