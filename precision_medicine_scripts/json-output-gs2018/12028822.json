In Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD), the number of neurotrophins and receptors is markedly decreased. The cause of this reduction is unclear, but the role of beta-amyloid (Abeta) seems central in understanding the mechanisms controlling neurotrophin and trk expression. In the study reported here, we exposed SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells to Abeta or hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and measured the expression of trk-A and p75 at the protein and molecular levels. Both Abeta and H(2)O(2) induced oxidative stress (measured by a decrease in cellular glutathione), which decreased trk-A levels and increased p75 levels, decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of both receptors, and increased nerve growth factor (NGF) secretion. Pretreatment of cells with the antioxidant melatonin returned levels of protein expression, mRNA, and NGF secretion to normal. These results are significant, as they can help in the planning and implementation of AD treatment strategies involving neurotrophins.","title":"Oxidative stress modulates tyrosine kinase receptor A and p75 receptor (low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) expression in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells.","pubmedId":"12028822"}
