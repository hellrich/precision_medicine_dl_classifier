Data are limited with respect to the basis for treatment recommendations because of the rarity of MM. The overall prognosis of melanomas of the female genital tract is very poor. Two cases of MM of the female genital tract are presented. The first case is of a 70-year-old female patient who complained of left thigh pain and underwent magnetic resonance imaging that showed cervical cancer with involvement of the vagina, bladder, and parametrium, in addition to multiple bony metastases of the proximal femur, acetabulum, and both iliac bones. The second case is of a 35-year-old female patient who suffered from vaginal bleeding for 5 months, and she was diagnosed as having primary vaginal melanoma. The patient underwent radical surgery and two additional surgeries because of recurrence of cancer in both inguinal areas. After surgery, the patient received adjuvant immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. In both the aforementioned cases, the pathologic diagnosis was made after immunohistochemical analysis, i.e., the tumor cells were stained with HMB-45 and S100, and were found to be positive for both immunostains.
