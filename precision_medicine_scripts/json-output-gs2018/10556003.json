The questionnaire consisted of 12 statements on the incidence, presentation, detection, treatment and prognosis of colorectal and breast cancer.\nOne thousand and sixty-eight individuals returned the questionnaire. One thousand and four completed questionnaires were analysed. The mean age (SD) of respondents was 50.1 (17.2) years, and the male to female ratio was 2:3. Respondents had read more about breast than about colorectal cancer (60.3%vs 32.4%, P\u003c0.0001, McNemar\u0027s test). The proportion of correct answers for each statement on breast cancer was higher than for answers to corresponding items on colorectal cancer. Mean overall scores (95% CI) for breast and colorectal cancer were 88.1 (86.9, 89.2) and 64.4 (62.5, 66.3) respectively, the mean difference (95% CI) being 23.7 (22.0, 25.5). Scores were higher for breast cancer irrespective of age or gender.\nThere is a low level of understanding of colorectal cancer in the general population when compared to breast cancer. This highlights the importance of public education in this common cancer.","title":"A comparative study of knowledge and awareness of colorectal and breast cancer.","pubmedId":"10556003"}
