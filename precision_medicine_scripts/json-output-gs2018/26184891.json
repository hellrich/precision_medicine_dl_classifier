A positive family history of cancer or leukemia was associated with the risk of relapse (family history of cancer in relapse: n \u003d 11; 61%, P \u003d 0.136, leukemia: n \u003d 7; 39%; P \u003d 0.016). Treatment-related mortality was 19% and associated with underweight patients (n \u003d 5; 62.5%; P \u003d 0.158). Event-free and overall survivals were 36% (SE \u003d 3.5) and 44% (SE \u003d 3.4), respectively. These data suggest a possible relationship between family history and relapse rate.","title":"Family History and Relapse in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia.","pubmedId":"26184891"}
