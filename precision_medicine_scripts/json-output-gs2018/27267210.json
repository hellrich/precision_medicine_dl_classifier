{"organisms":["407817"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) thyroid nodule guidelines recommend selecting nodules for biopsy based on a sonographic pattern classification. These patterns were developed based on features of differentiated thyroid cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the performance and the inter-observer agreement of this classification system in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).\nThe medical records of all patients with MTC evaluated at the authors\u0027 institution between 1998 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Only patients with presurgical thyroid ultrasound available for review were included in the study. Five independent reviewers assessed the stored ultrasound images for composition, echogenicity, margins, presence of calcifications, and extrathyroidal extension for each nodule. The presence of suspicious lymph nodes was also evaluated when presurgical lateral neck ultrasound was available for review. Each nodule was classified according to the ATA sonographic patterns. Inter-observer agreement was calculated for each sonographic feature and for the sonographic patterns. To validate the findings, a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis on the sonographic features of MTC was conducted.\nIn this institutional cohort, the inter-observer agreement for individual sonographic features was moderate to good (κ \u003d 0.45-0.71), and for the ATA classification it was good (κ \u003d 0.72). Ninety-seven percent (29/30) of the MTCs were classified in the intermediate or high suspicion patterns. A total of 249 MTCs were included in the meta-analysis. Based on pooled frequencies for solid composition and hypoechogenicity, \u003e95% of MTCs would be classified at least in the intermediate suspicion pattern, warranting the lowest-size threshold for biopsy (≥1 cm).\nThe sonographic patterns proposed by the ATA perform well in MTC, and inter-observer agreement is good to very good.","title":"New American Thyroid Association Sonographic Patterns for Thyroid Nodules Perform Well in Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma: Institutional Experience, Systematic Review, and Meta-Analysis.","pubmedId":"27267210"}
