HRD causes LOH, a pattern of allelic imbalance detectable by CGP. BRCAwt OC-S can have LOH and respond to PARPi, while non-serous (OC-NS) or difficult to classify (OC-NOS) OC are often less responsive to Pt-based therapy. Integrating multiple genomic features derived from CGP may define other therapeutically relevant subsets. Methods: DNA from FFPE tumor tissue obtained during clinical care for 4114 advanced OC was analyzed for all classes of genomic alterations (GA) by hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing of up to 315 genes. Tumor subtype counts were OC-S, n \u003d 2770; OC-NOS, n \u003d 807; OC-NS, n \u003d 537 (mucinous, clear cell, endometrioid, neuroendocrine, carcinosarcomas, and low grade serous). Algorithms evaluated microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutation burden (TMB; TMB-H  10 muts/Mb), and LOH (LOH-H  14, LOH-L \u003c 14). Results: 706/4114 (17.2%) OC had 1 deleterious BRCA GA, OC-S (18.7%) more so than OC-NS (4.4%). Median LOH score for OC-S was significantly higher than OC-NS (12.8 vs. 5.8, p \u003c 0.05). BRCAmut OC-S and OC-NS were similarly LOH-H (86% and 75%), unlike BRCAwt OC-S (38.4%) or OC-NS (18%). Regardless of LOH, similar co-occurrence of MYC (26.9%) and/or NF1 (19%) GA was seen in BRCAmut OC. BRCAwt LOH-L OC commonly had CCNE1 (19.7%), KRAS (19%), PIK3CA (16.2%), AKT2 (7.4%), ERBB2 (4.7%), or BRAF(3.3%) GA. Frequency of TMB-H was 2.5% and MSI-H 1%. Correlation of GA with treatment, clinical histories and outcomes for some patients will be presented. Conclusions:BRCAmut or OC-S are commonly LOH-H; ~1 in 5 BRCAwt OC-NS, including carcinosarcomas and mucinous, are also LOH-H. Genes co-mutated in late stage LOH-H OC may be linked to treatment resistance. CGP of this large OC cohort reveals molecular, rather than histologic, patient subsets that may benefit from PARPi (46.2% BRCAmut or LOH-H), targeted therapy ( \u003e 50% BRCAwt LOH-L, excluding TP53) or immunotherapy (3.5% TMB-H or MSI-H), providing more support for insurance coverage and integration into OC clinical trials.","title":"Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) to identify therapeutically relevant subsets of ovarian cancer (OC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_194232-199"}
