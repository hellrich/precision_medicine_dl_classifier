Conjunctival biopsies demonstrated MM arising from primary acquired melanosis with atypia. Two excision and cryotherapy procedures did not completely eradicate the conjunctival pigment, which was then treated with topical mitomycin C. Subsequent biopsies and clinical examinations have revealed no remaining tumor.\nConjunctival MM is uncommon in patients with NF-1 and can be successfully treated with excision, cryotherapy, and topical mitomycin C.","title":"Conjunctival melanoma arising from primary acquired melanosis in a patient with neurofibromatosis type I.","pubmedId":"20023582"}
