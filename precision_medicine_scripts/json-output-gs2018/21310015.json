Dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using centromeric probes for chromosome 3 and 8 in archived patient tissues.\nThe mean age of patients was 53.2 years (range; 29-78), and the mean largest basal diameter was 11.8 mm (range; 6.0-18.1). Of the 20 tissue blocks with available cytogenetic data, there was monosomy 3 in seven (35%) and polysomy 8 in four (20%). The presence of monosomy 3 (p \u003c 0.001), polysomy 8 (p \u003c 0.001), ciliary body involvement (p \u003c 0.001), a mitotic rate â‰¥5/40 high-power fields (p \u003d 0.006), closed extravascular matrix loop (p \u003d 0.025), large basal tumour diameter (p \u003d 0.029) and epithelioid cellularity (p \u003d 0.038) predicted melanoma-related mortality. The median time from enucleation to liver metastasis was 16 months (range; 10-70), and the median survival after metastasis was 5 months (range; 1-9). The Kaplan--Meier survival curve estimated the metastatic death rate to be 22% for 5 years and 30% for 10 years.\nKorean patients with uveal melanoma are younger and appear to exhibit no worse prognosis than Caucasian. Cytogenetic abnormality of chromosome 3 and 8 highly predicted metastatic death.","title":"Cytogenetics and prognosis for uveal melanoma in Korean patients.","pubmedId":"21310015"}
