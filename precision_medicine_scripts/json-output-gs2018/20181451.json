This study aims to analyze the prognostic factors, outcome and the value of surgical therapy on recurrent disease.\nFrom 1992 to 2006, a total of 33 patients with ACC originating in minor salivary glands of the oral cavity were clinicopathologically reviewed. Clinical and histological data was analyzed by univariate analysis using the log-rank test.\n64% of patients had a low-grade and 36% had a high grade disease. The 2-, 5- and 10-year survivals were 89.7%, 62.1% and 54.2%. The T category (p\u003d0.001), N category (p\u003d0.027), UICC stage (p\u003c0.0001), and resection margins (p\u003d0.024) influenced survival. Salvage treatment influenced patient\u0027s overall survival (p\u003d0.002).\nThis study confirms that in ACC T category, N category, UICC stage, and resection margin status correlates well with prognosis. Salvage surgery of patients with recurrent ACC should be performed if possible as the survival is significantly increased.","title":"Adenoid cystic carcinomas of minor salivary glands.","pubmedId":"20181451"}
