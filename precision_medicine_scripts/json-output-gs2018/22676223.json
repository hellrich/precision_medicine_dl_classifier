The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) molecule is very important in GC progression. To examine the correlation between EGFR and GC-related genes, we analyzed gene expression profiles of HT-29 cells treated with EGFR ligands and identified six genes upregulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α treatment. Among these, we focused on cadherin 17 (CDH17) encoding liver-intestine cadherin (LI-cadherin). Expression of LI-cadherin was induced by both EGF and TGF-α, as detected by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. A luciferase assay showed that LI-cadherin promoter activity was enhanced by EGF or TGF-α in both HT-29 cells and MKN-74 GC cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of 152 GC cases showed that out of 58 LI-cadherin-positive cases, 24 (41%) cases were also positive for EGFR, whereas out of 94 LI-cadherin-negative cases, only 9 (10%) cases were positive for EGFR (P \u003c 0.0001). Double-immunofluorescence staining revealed that EGFR and LI-cadherin were coexpressed. Significant correlation was found between LI-cadherin expression and advanced T grade and N grade. Both EGFR and LI-cadherin expression were more frequently found in GC cases with an intestinal mucin phenotype than in cases with a gastric mucin phenotype. These results indicate that, in addition to the known intestinal transcription factor caudal type homeobox 2, EGFR activation induces LI-cadherin expression and participates in intestinal differentiation of GC.","title":"Liver-intestine cadherin induction by epidermal growth factor receptor is associated with intestinal differentiation of gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"22676223"}
