It is the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It results in juxtaposition of the 5\u0027 part of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to the 3\u0027 part of the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9. During CML progression 60-80 % of the cases acquire additional genetic changes. Blast crisis (BC) is characterized by the rapid expansion of a population of differentiation arrested blast cells (myeloid or lymphoid cells population), often presenting with secondary chromosomal abnormalities. Here we report an unusual CML-BC case with acquired secondary chromosomal aberrations observed after the patient had to interrupt a successful Imatinib treatment for overall 16 months.\nA complete cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analysis were performed and application of molecular genetic methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) finally characterized a complex karyotype including an inv dup(22)(q11.23), tetrasomy 8 and trisomy 19.\nHere we report the first case of a BC after successfully initiated and suddenly interrupted Imatinib treatment. Changes present after such an instant indicate for a rapid progression after Imatinib is no longer suppressing the disease.","title":"Masked inv dup(22)(q11.23), tetrasomy 8 and trisomy 19 in a blast crisis-chronic myeloid leukemia after interrupted Imatinib-treatment.","pubmedId":"26705423"}
