Eleven consecutive patients were included (seven female, mean age 57.6 years). All patients were Caucasian. Five of 11 had a clinical history of chronic liver disease. Two radiologists retrospectively analyzed the images in consensus.\ncHCC-CC was a single mass in 10/11 patients. Margins were well-defined in 6/11. All tumors showed heterogeneous hyperintensity on T2. On postcontrast imaging, 6/11 showed early ring-enhancement (four noncirrhotic), with progressive enhancement in central portions, and 5/11 patients showed a diffuse heterogeneous early enhancement. Three of these five were cirrhotic and displayed partial washout with portions of contrast retention on later phases. Other findings included: late capsule enhancement (two patients), biliary dilatation (one), venous invasion (three), lymphadenopathy (six), and findings of cirrhosis (five).\ncHCC-CC presents most commonly as a single mass. Five of 11 had MR findings of cirrhosis. Clues to the diagnosis were moderately high signal on T2, portions of tumor that show progressive enhancement/contrast retention, and frequent lack of capsule. Early enhancement patterns included early ring-enhancement and diffuse heterogeneous enhancement.","title":"Combined hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma: report of MR appearance in eleven patients.","pubmedId":"22782783"}
