Baseline tumor characteristics included tumor location, tumor thickness, tumor diameter, tumor origin, and tumor growth pattern. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses of the risk of local recurrence, lymphatic spread, distant metastasis, and melanoma-related death were performed.\nIntratumoral lymphatic vascular density and its association with tumor characteristics and recurrence-free, lymphatic spread-free, distant metastasis-free, and melanoma-specific survival.\nIntratumoral and peritumoral proliferating lymphatic vessels could be detected in all of the 109 conjunctival melanoma samples. High intratumoral lymphatic density was significantly associated with palpebral tumor location (P\u003c0.001), greater tumor thickness (P\u003c0.001), larger tumor diameter (P \u003d 0.001), tumor origin de novo (P \u003d 0.002), and nodular tumor growth pattern (P \u003d 0.037). Patients with high intratumoral lymphatic density revealed significantly lower recurrence-free, lymphatic spread-free, distant metastasis-free, and melanoma-specific survival rates (P\u003c0.001 for all). By multivariate Cox regression, factors predictive of local recurrence included palpebral tumor location (hazard ratio [HR] 2.66, P \u003d 0.014), large tumor diameter (HR 5.48, P\u003c0.001), and high intratumoral lymphatic density (HR 2.48, P \u003d 0.043); factors predictive of lymphatic spread included palpebral tumor location (HR 4.13, P \u003d 0.009), high tumor thickness (HR 12.17, P\u003c0.001), and high intratumoral lymphatic density (HR 6.79, P \u003d 0.019); factors predictive of distant metastasis included palpebral tumor location (HR 7.63, P\u003c0.001), high tumor thickness (HR 8.60, P\u003c0.001), large tumor diameter (HR 0.30, P \u003d 0.029), and high intratumoral lymphatic density (HR 8.90, P \u003d 0.047); and factors predictive of melanoma-related death included palpebral tumor location (HR 7.74, P\u003c0.001), high tumor thickness (HR 10.88, P\u003c0.001), large tumor diameter (HR 0.28, P \u003d 0.018), and, with borderline significance, high intratumoral lymphatic density (HR 8.46, P \u003d 0.052).\nTumor-associated lymphangiogenesis seems to be associated with an increased risk of local recurrence, lymphatic spread, distant metastasis, and melanoma-related death in patients with conjunctival malignant melanomas.\nThe author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.","title":"Prognostic significance of tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis in malignant melanomas of the conjunctiva.","pubmedId":"21835473"}
