There is limited published evidence reporting the prevalence of RAS mutations in patients with mCRC in a real-world setting. The aim of this study was to use data from a range of real-world sources to obtain RAS mutation prevalence estimates for different geographic regions.  Methods:   Aggregated RAS mutation prevalence data were collected from 13 sources, including individual pathology centers (n \u003d 7), mCRC registries (n \u003d 3), and Amgen-sponsored studies (n \u003d 3). Data sources included in this study originated in Europe (n \u003d 10), the Middle East (n \u003d 2), and South America (n \u003d 1). A meta-analysis of all collected data was carried out to investigate the effect of heterogeneity amongst the data sources and obtain pooled RAS prevalence estimates for each, using a mixed regression model.  Results:   Aggregate data from 4322 patients with mCRC were included in the pooled meta-analysis. The overall RAS mutation prevalence across all data sources was estimated to be 43.5% (95% CI: 41.545.5%). RAS mutation prevalence varied between data sources, ranging from low estimates of 33.7% (95% CI: 28.439.3%) for a Middle Eastern pathology dataset, and 34.6% (95% CI: 27.742.1%) for a Middle Eastern mCRC registry, to the highest estimates of 53.6% (95% CI: 43.263.8%) and 54.1% (95% CI: 51.756.5%) in two European pathology centers, in the Czech Republic and Poland, respectively. Conclusions:   This is one of the first studies to carry out a large pooled analysis of RAS mutation prevalence, based on real-world data. There was a high degree of heterogeneity between the sources included, possibly due to the types of data source, patient selection criteria, geographic location, or differences in laboratory testing methods. The estimated RAS mutation prevalence reported here is lower than that in a recent pooled analysis of past clinical trials, which reported an overall prevalence of 55.5% (95% CI: 53.957.9%) (Peeters M, et al. Eur J Cancer 2015;51:170413). Further investigations are required to explain the disparity in these findings.","title":"RAS mutation prevalence among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis of real-world data.","pubmedId":"ASCO_160011-173"}
