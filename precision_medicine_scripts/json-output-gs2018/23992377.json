Recently, BRAF-kinase inhibitors as well as MEK-kinase inhibitors were introduced into the clinics.\nSubstantial Phase II and III clinical trials were searched in patients with advanced melanoma treated with BRAF-kinase inhibitors, MEK-kinase inhibitors and cKIT inhibitors.\nFor patients with a BRAF, NRAS or cKIT mutation the treatment with selective, targeted drugs is considered as feasible and results in a high rate of confirmed tumor responses. In patients with BRAF mutation the progression free survival and overall survival is prolonged in patients who were treated with BRAF kinase inhibitors or MEK kinase inhibitors compared to patients receiving chemotherapy with dacarbazine. A major problem is the development of resistance to the inhibitors through multiple different mechanisms. One approach to overcome resistance is to combine BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Treatments with kinase inhibitors are more efficacious than chemotherapies, however, they compete with the newly developed immune checkpoint blockers, and may in future be preferentially applied in second- or x-line.","title":"Protein kinase inhibitors in melanoma.","pubmedId":"23992377"}
