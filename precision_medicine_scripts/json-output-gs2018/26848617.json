However, some KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs with KIT mutations in other exons were occasionally reported. We therefore assessed GISTs to understand the whole genomic genotypes of KIT or PDGFRA genes in KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs.\nA cohort of 185 KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs from 1,080 cases was retrospectively assessed. Thirty-nine patients were excluded due to insufficiency of genomic DNA data or failure of library preparation, and 146 patients were analyzed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) followed by validation.\nFor hot spots in KIT and PDGFRA genes, 23 out of 146 KIT/PDGFRA wild-type cases carried mutations according to NGS; there were 19 KIT mutations and 4 PDGFRA mutations, and these were exclusive. Intratumoral KIT mutational heterogeneity was observed in 4 of 19 samples which potentially triggered mechanisms of polyclonal evolution and metastasis and drug sensitivity. Eleven patients treated with imatinib were evaluable for clinical response, and 2 of 3 patients with KIT mutations achieved partial response (PR), while only 1 of 8 patients without KIT mutations reached PR.\nNGS had the potential property to identify partial mutant tumors from a subset of GISTs regarded as KIT/PDGFRA wild-type tumors using Sanger sequencing, and provided a better understanding of KIT/PDGFRA genotypes as well as identified patients eligible for imatinib therapy.","title":"Intratumoral KIT mutational heterogeneity and recurrent KIT/ PDGFRA mutations in KIT/PDGFRA wild-type gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"26848617"}
