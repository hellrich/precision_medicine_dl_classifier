None of the patients (ages 6-18 years; 20 females, 8 males) had significant exposure to radiation. Nucleic acid from tumors was tested for genetic abnormalities (n \u003d 27). Negative results were reevaluated by targeted next-generation sequencing.\nSeven of 27 PTCs (26%) had neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK) fusion oncogenes (NTRK type 3/ets variant 6 [NTRK3/ETV6], n \u003d5; NTRK3/unknown, n \u003d 1; and NTRK type 1/translocated promoter region, nuclear basket protein [NTRK1/TPR], n \u003d 1), including 5 tumors that measured \u003e2 cm and 3 that diffusely involved the entire thyroid or lobe. All 7 tumors had lymphatic invasion, and 5 had vascular invasion. Six of 27 PTCs (22%) had ret proto-oncogene (RET) fusions (RET/PTC1, n \u003d 5; RET/PTC3, n \u003d 1); 2 tumors measured \u003e2 cm and diffusely involved the thyroid, and 5 had lymphatic invasion, with vascular invasion in 2. Thirteen PTCs had the B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) valine-to-glutamic acid mutation at position 600 (BRAF(V) (600E)) (13 of 27 tumors; 48%), 11 measured \u003c2 cm, and 6 had lymphatic invasion (46%), with vascular invasion in 3. Fusion oncogene tumors, compared with BRAF(V) (600E) PTCs, were associated with large size (mean, 2.2 cm vs 1.5 cm, respectively; P \u003d .05), solid and diffuse variants (11 of 13 vs 0 of 13 tumors, respectively; P \u003c .001), and lymphovascular invasion (12 of 13 vs 6 of 13 tumors, respectively; P \u003d .02); BRAF(V) (600E) PTCs were predominantly the classic variant (12 of 13 vs 1 of 13 tumors). Two tumors metastasized to the lung, and both had fusion oncogenes (NTRK1/TPR, n \u003d 1; RET/PTC1, n \u003d 1).\nFusion oncogene PTC presents with more extensive disease and aggressive pathology than BRAF(V) (600E) PTC in the pediatric population. The high prevalence of the NTRK1/NTRK3 fusion oncogene PTCs in the United States is unusual and needs further investigation.","title":"NTRK fusion oncogenes in pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma in northeast United States.","pubmedId":"26784937"}
