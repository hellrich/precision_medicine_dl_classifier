We report the characterization of AC220, a second-generation FLT3 inhibitor, and a comparison of AC220 with the first-generation FLT3 inhibitors CEP-701, MLN-518, PKC-412, sorafenib, and sunitinib. AC220 exhibits low nanomolar potency in biochemical and cellular assays and exceptional kinase selectivity, and in animal models is efficacious at doses as low as 1 mg/kg given orally once daily. The data reveal that the combination of excellent potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties is unique to AC220, which therefore is the first drug candidate with a profile that matches the characteristics desirable for a clinical FLT3 inhibitor.","title":"AC220 is a uniquely potent and selective inhibitor of FLT3 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).","pubmedId":"19654408"}
