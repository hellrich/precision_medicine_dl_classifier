In vitro, KIT signaling leads to MITF phosphorylation, affecting MITF activity and stability. In vivo, the presence of the Mitf (Mi-wh) allele exacerbates the spotting phenotype associated with heterozygosity for Kit mutations. Here, we show that among a series of other Mitf alleles, only the recessive Mitf (mi-bws) mimics the effect of Mitf (Mi-wh) on Kit. Intriguingly, Mitf (mi-bws) is characterized by a splice defect that leads to a reduction of RNAs containing MITF exon 2B which encodes serine-73, a serine phosphorylated upon KIT signaling. Nevertheless, other Mitf alleles that generally affect Mitf RNA levels, or carry a serine-73-to-alanine mutation that specifically reduces exon 2B-containing RNAs, do not show similar interactions with Kit in vivo. We conclude that the recessive Mitf (mi-bws) is a complex allele that can display a semi-dominant effect when present in a Kit-sensitized background. We suggest that human disease variability may equally be due to complex, allele-specific interactions between different genes.","title":"Allele-specific genetic interactions between Mitf and Kit affect melanocyte development.","pubmedId":"20374522"}
