Serum microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs with high stability and easy accessibility in human blood. Their expression profiles are frequently dysregulated in cancers; hence, levels of serum microRNAs may reflect progression status and thus predict melanoma prognosis. In a hospital based case-control study, we found a significant reduction of serum miR-16 level in melanoma patients compared with cancer-free controls (P \u003c 0.001). In addition, serum miR-16 level markedly decreased in melanoma patients with increased tumor thickness, occurrence of ulceration, and advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer stages, and was highly correlated with tissue Ki-67 expression (r \u003d -0.521, P \u003c 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed a prognostic role of serum miR-16 (hazard ratio 2.49, 95% confidence interval 1.10-5.63, P \u003d 0.028), which independently evaluated patients\u0027 survival outcome. Finally, the suppressive role of miR-16 in melanoma growth was validated both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrated that serum miR-16 is a potential biomarker for predicting melanoma prognosis.
