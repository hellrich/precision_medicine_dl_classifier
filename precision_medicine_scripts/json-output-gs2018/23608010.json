At the time of diagnosis few are candidates for complete resection, and the standard palliative therapy has been biliary stenting. Studies have shown that photodynamic therapy (PDT) improves survival time. In this case report we describe an 80-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis and perihilar CC classified as Bismuth-Corlette type II who successfully underwent PDT as the first patient in Denmark. The treatment was well tolerated with no phototoxic skin reaction, and a subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed reduction of tumour.","title":"[Photodynamic therapy of a cholangiocarcinoma in an 80-year-old man].","pubmedId":"23608010"}
