We exploited HoxA9 versus Gfi1 antagonism to identify the genes encoding microRNA-21 and microRNA-196b as transcriptional targets of Hox-based leukemia oncoproteins. Therapeutic inhibition of microRNA-21 and microRNA-196b significantly inhibits in vitro colony forming activity, and quantitatively depletes in vivo leukemia-initiating-cell activity of Hox-based leukemias leading to leukemia-free survival of murine AML and significant delay in disease onset in xenograft models. A novel microRNA target identification platform both validates therapeutic intervention and reveals biological impact of disrupting microRNA function. These data establish microRNA as functional effectors of endogenous HoxA9 and Hox-based leukemia oncoproteins, provide a concise in vivo platform to test RNA therapeutics, and suggest therapeutic value for microRNA antagonists in AML.","title":"microRNA-mediated leukemia-initiating cell activity","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-979"}
