MGCD265 targets the Met, VEGFR1, 2, 3, Tie2 and Ron receptor tyrosine kinases and blocks key pathways regulating cancer development and progression. Met-targeted agents, including MGCD265, have shown early signs of clinical activities when combined with EGFR inhibitors. While this combination is supported by a large body of evidence indicating that Met and EGFR functionally cooperate to amplify activating signals, how the combination of agents targeting these two pathways leads to efficient anti-tumor responses remains to be elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that the combination of MGCD265 with erlotinib achieved greater tumor growth inhibition than treatment with either agent alone in multiple xenografts including a gastric cancer model in which Met is amplified (MKN45). We performed gene expression analyses in this model to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficient anti-tumor activities of MGCD265 in combination with erlotinib. While these studies revealed the inhibition of cell growth and the induction of apoptosis pathways as enhanced by this combination, the regulation of glycolysis surfaced as a novel pathway altered by this combination. Although genes regulating this pathway were partly downmodulated by either agent alone, the combination significantly enhanced this effect. A key mediator of glycolysis, hexokinase 2 (HK2), known to be elevated in cancer cells and essential for the switch to aerobic glycolysis as well as for mitochondrial-initiated cell death, was significantly downregulated by the combination. Furthermore, PFKFB3, PGK, ENO1, PKM2 were also inhibited by the combination. These results suggest that regulating tumor cell glycolysis may present a novel pathway through which MGCD265 could block tumor cell growth. Thus, the inhibition of multiple molecular pathways involved in cancer growth and progression provides a rationale for the clinical development of MGCD265 in combination with erlotinib. Early results from an ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial of MGCD265 in combination with erlotinib has demonstrated encouraging signs of activity in gastric cancer patients.","title":"The combination of MGCD265, a Met/VEGFR inhibitor in clinical development, and erlotinib potently inhibits tumor growth by altering multiple pathways including glycolysis","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1790"}
