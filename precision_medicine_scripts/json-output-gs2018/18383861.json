The aim of this study was to genotype a cohort of 55 sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and 44 sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) for the K-RAS codon 12 and BRAF codon 600 mutations.\nK-RAS and BRAF mutations were characterized by an enhanced polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP).\nThe K-RAS codon 12 mutation was found in 54.5% of the PTC and 40.9% of the MTC cases tested. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 27.3% of the PTC and 68.2% of the MTC samples. No significant association between K-RAS and BRAF mutations and clinicopathological parameters was found.\nThese data indicate that K-RAS and BRAF mutations were a frequent genetic event in our samples of sporadic PTC and MTC.","title":"BRAF and K-RAS mutation in a Greek papillary and medullary thyroid carcinoma cohort.","pubmedId":"18383861"}
