The dose applied was 10-50 mCi when there were no metastases, 50-100 mCi when there were regional or distant metastases. The group of children is compared with a group of 16 adults aged 21-30 years. In an observation time of 1-16 years, all patients are alive and without recurrences or metastases. There are no complications; only one patient with neck dissection and external irradiation has had local complaints and difficulties with hormone substitution.","title":"Thyroid carcinoma in childhood.","pubmedId":"6878727"}
