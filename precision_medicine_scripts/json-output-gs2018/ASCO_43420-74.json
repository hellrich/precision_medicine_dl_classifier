Preclinical studies report a critical role of c-KIT amplification and mutations in mucosal, acral, and solar melanomas. Preliminary data from clinical trials of KIT-directed therapy suggest their potential efficacy in these subtypes of melanomas. Targeting KIT, PDGFR, and SRC family kinases (SFK), dasatinib has inhibitory effects not seen with imatinib and nilotinib in melanoma cell lines with the most common KIT mutation, 11L576P. E2607 tests the efficacy of dasatinib in treatment-naive or previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma with these subtypes. Methods: We plan to enroll up to 110 patients with acral (palms, soles, or subungual sites), mucosal, or cutaneous melanomas with chronic sun damage (solar elastosis in the skin adjacent to the melanoma). Solar elastosis must be confirmed centrally. Patients receive dasatinib 70 mg PO twice daily on an open-label, single-arm basis. Cycle length is 21 days, without breaks between cycles. The primary endpoint is objective tumor response rate for dasatinib using RECIST criteria. Secondary objectives include response duration, progression-free survival, and safety. Correlative studies include assessing KIT expression, amplification and mutation, PDGFR expression, and SFK activation in tumor samples and correlating these findings with response. The study is designed in two stages, with accrual open to molecularly proven KIT+ and KIT- patients in the first stage. If responses are seen only in KIT+ patients at interim analysis (n\u003d56 patients), strictly KIT+ patients will be enrolled (n\u003d22 in each melanoma subtype). If response rate appears unrelated to KIT status, with response rate of at least 20%, the study will remain open to all patients (n\u003d110).","title":"A phase II trial of dasatinib in patients with unresectable locally advanced or stage IV mucosal, acral, and solar melanomas: An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study (E2607).","pubmedId":"ASCO_43420-74"}
