The phenotype of Albright syndrome includes 5 common features: brachydactyly, obesity, short stature, a round face, and mental retardation. We report on a child with a classic form of pseudohypoparathyroidism and associated Albright syndrome who developed Evans syndrome (ie, the cooccurrence of severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura). To our knowledge, no cases of Evans syndrome have been observed associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism 1a.","title":"Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia with Evans syndrome.","pubmedId":"18799944"}
