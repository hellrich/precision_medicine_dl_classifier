There were 48 female and 26 male patients. Idiopathic AIHA patients more often had two or more positive monospecific reactions in the direct antiglobulin test than secondary AIHA patients. Increased serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, indicating increased intravascular haemolysis, were found more frequently in patients with two or more positive monospecific antiglobulin tests. The number of thromboembolic complications and deaths correlated positively with the number of positive monospecific reactions in antiglobulin test. In particular, positive direct antiglobulin test with monospecific anti-IgA was often combined with severe AIHA.","title":"Significance of monospecific antisera in the diagnosis and prognosis of autoimmune haemolytic anaemias.","pubmedId":"7235614"}
