The scattering and invasion of cancer cells induced by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation has been suggested to be probably by affecting E-cadherin function. The aim of this study is to confirm whether EGFR amplification is related to E-cadherin expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.\nFifty patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were studied. EGFR amplification was analyzed by semiquantitative PCR. E-cadherin expressión was determined by immunohistochemistry.\nEGFR amplification was found in 9 cases (18%). E-cadherin expression was generally weaker in tumors than in adjacent normal epithelium. No relationship was found between EGFR amplification and E-cadherin expression.\nEGFR amplification did not affect the level of E-cadherin expression, suggesting a complementary role of both of these molecules in reduction of cellular adhesion in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.","title":"[Epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification and E-cadherin expression in head and neck carcinomas].","pubmedId":"15658558"}
