Although the presence of P124SMEK1 or I111SMEK1 mutations did not predict for resistance, and these alleles were not selected for upon BRAF inhibition, other exon 3 MEK1 mutations, such as C121S, did convey resistance, suggesting a role for defined exon 3 MEK1 mutations in acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance.","title":"Making sense of MEK1 mutations in intrinsic and acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance.","pubmedId":"22588873"}
