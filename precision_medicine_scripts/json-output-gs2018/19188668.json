We examined the role of the aPC/EPCR pathway on tumor migration and metastasis. In vitro, B16-F10 melanoma cells showed decreased adhesion to and transmigration through endothelium treated with recombinant human aPC (rhaPC). In murine B16-F10 metastasis models, transgenic EPCR overexpressing (Tie2-EPCR) mice exhibited marked reductions in liver (50%) and lung (92%) metastases compared with wild-type (WT) animals. Intravital imaging showed reduced B16-F10 entrapment within livers of Tie2-EPCR compared with WT mice. A similar reduction was observed in WT mice treated with rhaPC. Strikingly, rhaPC treatment resulted in a 44% reduction in lung metastases. This was associated with decreased lung P-selectin and TNF-alpha mRNA levels. These findings support an important role for the aPC/EPCR pathway in reducing metastasis via inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and transmigration.","title":"Role of activated protein C and its receptor in inhibition of tumor metastasis.","pubmedId":"19188668"}
