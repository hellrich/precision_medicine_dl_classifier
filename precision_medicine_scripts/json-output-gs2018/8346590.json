There were 287 females and 225 males. The median age at primary surgery was 65 years, range 18 to 96 years. The median observation period was 5 years, range 1 month to 25 years. Sex, age, ulcerated tumor and tumor thickness were found by Cox multivariate regression analysis to act as independent prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival. In addition, size of the excision margin was found of no significance for survival without relapse when adjusting for the independent risk factors.","title":"[Significant prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival after surgical treatment of head-neck melanoma].","pubmedId":"8346590"}
