Cephalometric measurements were carried out on radiographs, and measurements of angles and distances were performed.Statistical differences between NBCCS subjects and controls were observed. Data analysis displayed that the measurements of the anterior cranial base (P \u003cor\u003d 0.0043), mandibular length (P \u003cor\u003d 0.0168), and maxillary length (P \u003cor\u003d 0.0284), posterior facial height (P \u003cor\u003d 0.0406), and of mandibular angle (P \u003cor\u003d 0.0026), facial axis angle (P \u003cor\u003d 0.0402), lower facial height angles (P \u003cor\u003d 0.0135), and of interincisal angulation (P \u003cor\u003d 0.0148) were higher in NBCCS subjects in respect to controls. On the contrary, the facial convexity (P \u003cor\u003d 0.0189) and the mandibular arc angle (P \u003cor\u003d 0.0378) were reduced in NBCCS subjects.According to these findings, NBCCS patients presented a sagittal lengthening of the anterior cranial base and maxilla and a vertically and horizontally overdeveloped mandible, together with the features of a long-face syndrome with a large gonial angle.","title":"Nevoid Basal cell carcinoma syndrome: a cephalometric study of patients and controls.","pubmedId":"19165028"}
