Both the invasive nature and location in vital areas of the brain make this type of tumors difficult for surgical treatment, while the current adjuvant therapy is not as successful as expected. Frequent recurrence and invasiveness of malignant gliomas is due to resistance of glioma stem cells to conventional radiation and chemotherapy. Technological advances in constructing recombinant viruses have allowed creating strains with high oncolytic activity toward glial tumors. Many of these strains have passed Phase I of clinical trials and demonstrated high safety. Despite the obvious potential of the approach, efficiency of the existing strains is still far from being sufficient for effectively curing the disease and require further improvement. The review summarizes results obtained with the most successful variants of oncolytic viruses that come down to the clinical trials and discusses the prospects for new approaches in virotherapy of malignant gliomas.","title":"[Oncolytic viruses in the therapy of gliomas].","pubmedId":"23350233"}
