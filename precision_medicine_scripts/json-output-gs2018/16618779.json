One somatic event in this pathway, homozygous deletion of the p16INK4A gene, is commonly observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Alcohol and tobacco are both well-established risk factors for HNSCC but there has been little characterization of the relationship of exposure to these carcinogens and inactivation of the p16INK4A gene. Hypothesizing that p16INK4A homozygous deletion is associated with tobacco and alcohol exposure, we investigated 330 consecutive HNSCC tumors. The odds ratio (OR) for p16INK4A homozygous deletion among alcohol consumers in the upper tertile (\u003e43 years used) was 5.2 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.1-12.8] as compared with those with \u003c or \u003d 43 years of alcohol consumption. Intensity of alcohol exposure, measured as average alcoholic drinks per week, was not associated with gene deletion. When we examined the distribution of duration of tobacco use, the OR for p16(INK4A) homozygous deletion was 1.3 (95% CI, 0.5-3.0) and 1.9 (95% CI, 0.9-4.0) for 29 to 39 years and \u003e39 years of tobacco smoking, respectively, as compared with those that smoked \u003c or \u003d 28 years. As in the case of alcohol use, intensity of tobacco exposure (measured as packs per day) was not associated with gene deletion. Hence, the duration of alcohol use and duration of smoking, but not intensity of either, significantly predicted p16(INK4A) homozygous deletion in HNSCC.","title":"Duration but not intensity of alcohol and tobacco exposure predicts p16INK4A homozygous deletion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16618779"}
