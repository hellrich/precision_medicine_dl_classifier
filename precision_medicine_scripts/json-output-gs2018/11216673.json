We have investigated the TP53 status and cell cycle response to ionizing radiation of a series of early passage cell lines (designated NZM1 to NZM15) previously developed from patients with metastatic melanoma. The TP53 status of each of the cell lines was determined by single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analysis. The majority of the lines appeared to have a wild-type TP53 gene sequence, consistent with published studies. Two lines (NZM4 and NZM7.2) were found to have an identical T--\u003eC transition mutation in nucleotide 721 (exon 7) of the coding region. NZM7.2 (mutant) and NZM7.4 (wild-type) were clonally derived from the same line (NZM7). The existence of radiation-induced cell cycle arrest in G and/or G2M phase was determined 16 h after irradiation (6.3 Gy) by DNA staining and flow cytometric analysis. The mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel was used as a reference compound, with or without irradiation, to assess the efficiency of radiation-induced cell cycle arrest. G1 phase arrest was associated only with the presence of the wild-type TP53 gene, but the efficiency of induced arrest varied among the cell lines and the period of G phase arrest appeared to be short. A significant difference (P \u003c 0.002) was also found between the efficiency of induction of G2 phase arrest and the presence of wild-type TP53 gene. The results provide evidence that although the melanoma cell lines generally had an intact TP53 gene, the efficiency of p53-mediated cycle arrest might be deficient and contribute to the resistance of this tumor to treatment.","title":"Radiation-induced cell cycle delays and p53 status of early passage melanoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"11216673"}
