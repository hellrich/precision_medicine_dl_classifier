Two radiologists retrospectively determined the sonographic diagnoses according to malignant criteria (a taller-than-wide shape, spiculated margin, marked hypoechogenicity, and microcalcifications or macrocalcifications) and compared the sonographic findings of MTCs and PTCs.\nMTCs were diagnosed as malignant for 72% of cases by sonography, whereas PTCs were 87% malignant (p \u003d 0.0511). Compared with PTCs, MTCs were larger (mean size, 2.3 +/- 1.5 cm vs 1.1 +/- 1.1 cm) (p \u003d 0.001; odds ratio [OR], 3.84; 95% CI, 1.719-8.565), more frequently showed the presence of a cystic change (33% vs 4%) (p \u003d 0.0226; OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.014-0.725), and more commonly showed homogeneous echotexture of the solid portion (59% vs 31%) (p \u003d 0.0004; OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.019-0.321). MTCs tended to show an oval shape and circumscribed margin, but there was no statistical significance in multivariate analysis. There were no significant differences in echogenicity, presence, and type of calcification for MTCs and PTCs.\nCurrently accepted sonographic criteria can be applied for a diagnosis of MTCs. MTCs differ from PTCs in size, presence of a cystic change, and echotexture.","title":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma: comparison with papillary thyroid carcinoma and application of current sonographic criteria.","pubmedId":"20308516"}
