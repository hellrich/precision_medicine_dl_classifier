One of the more common mutations, ALKF1174L, is sensitive to the sole FDA-approved ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, only at high doses and mediates acquired resistance to crizotinib in ALK-rearranged cancers. To identify compounds that would synergize with crizotinib to increase cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma cells, we devised a high-throughput small molecule synergy screen using the ALKF1174L-dependent SH-SY5Y cell line to compare cell viability between screen compound alone and screen compound in combination with crizotinib. Compounds ranged from those with clinical approval and known therapeutic indications to those with only predicted bioactivity. Of 10,000 compounds screened, the most recurrent hits included adrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter receptor inhibitors. Validation studies with a candidate dopamine receptor D2 antagonist, chlorpromazine, resulted in increased cytotoxicity when combined with crizotinib over that of either single agent alone. These studies support further pre-clinical efforts to explore the therapeutic potential of combining crizotinib with neurotransmitter receptor inhibitors in ALKF1174L-mutated neuroblastoma.","title":"A high-throughput chemical screen identifies synergistic activity between neurotransmitter receptor inhibitors and crizotinib in ALK-mutated neuroblastoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-790"}
