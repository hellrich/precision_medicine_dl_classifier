Fifteen patients were N+ on histopathology (group 1) and 16 were N-; nine of these 16 patients were CK19RT-PCR positive (group 2), whereas seven were negative (group 3). Local and neck recurrences, metastases, and other tumour sites were recorded during follow-up.\nFive patients in group 1, eight patients in group 2, and one patient in group 3 experienced a tumor-related event. N- patients in groups 2 and 3 had a different outcome (P\u003c0.01).\nIt is suggested that CK19RTPCR detection of micrometastasis in lymph nodes could be of significant prognostic value in HNSCC, because more aggressive treatment could be indicated in these patients.","title":"Clinical significance of micrometastases detection in lymph nodes from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"18722227"}
