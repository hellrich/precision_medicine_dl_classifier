To explore the potential utility of lapatinib for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we examined the expression profiles of EGFR and HER2 in tumor tissues and in paired adjacent non-neoplastic tissues from patients with ESCC. We evaluated the antitumor effects of lapatinib alone or in combination with oxaliplatin or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on a panel of primary ESCC cells in vitro with various levels of EGFR and HER2 expression. The in vivo effect of lapatinib alone or in combination with oxaliplatin or 5-FU was evaluated using a primary ESCC xenograft model. EGFR was overexpressed in 80.9% (76/94) of the ESCC samples, while 24.5% (23/94) of the samples overexpressed HER2. EGFR and HER2 co-overexpression was detected in 22.3% of samples (21/94). In vitro, the primary ESCC cells were more sensitive to lapatinib combined with 5-FU or oxaliplatin than to lapatinib alone. Lapatinib in combination with 5-FU had more potent antitumor effects in the primary ESCC xenograft model, and markedly reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, compared with lapatinib alone or in combination with oxaliplatin. These data indicate that lapatinib has activity in EGFR- and/or HER2-expressing ESCC primary cells, and that lapatinib in combination with 5-FU may be a promising treatment strategy for patients with ESCC.","title":"Lapatinib inhibits the growth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and synergistically interacts with 5-fluorouracil in patient-derived xenograft models.","pubmedId":"23708506"}
