The leukocyte blood count, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase retained their significance in a multivariate model including tumor differentiation, local tumor stage, and age. Inclusion of tissue polypeptide antigen, the most powerful tumor marker in the multivariate model, showed that only the tumor stage, tissue polypeptide antigen, and age were statistically significantly correlated to survival. This was valid both for the group of patients considered as potentially curable and for those who potentially have been cured (Dukes Stages A-C).\nA great number of prognostic predictors failed to discard Dukes stage as the best one. One serum tumor marker, tissue polypeptide antigen, contains independent additional prognostic information.","title":"Prognostic predictors in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"7995147"}
