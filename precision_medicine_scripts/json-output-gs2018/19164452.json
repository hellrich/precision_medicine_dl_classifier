We also compared MLH1 hypermethylation with truncating APC mutations and activating KRAS and BRAF mutations.\nOnly 10% of the tumors showed both MGMT and MLH1 hypermethylation. MGMT hypermethylation occurred more frequently in tumors with G:C \u003e A:T KRAS mutations (55%) compared with those without these mutations (38%, P \u003c 0.001). No such difference was observed for G:C \u003e A:T mutations in APC, regardless of whether mutations occurred in CpG or non-CpG dinucleotides. MLH1 hypermethylation was less common in tumors with APC mutations (P \u003d 0.006) or KRAS mutations (P \u003d 0.001), but was positively associated with BRAF mutations (P \u003c 0.001).\nMGMT hypermethylation is associated with G:C \u003e A:T mutations in KRAS, but not in APC, suggesting that MGMT hypermethylation may succeed APC mutations but precedes KRAS mutations in colorectal carcinogenesis. MLH1-hypermethylated tumors harbor fewer APC and KRAS mutations and more BRAF mutations, suggesting that they develop distinctly from an MGMT methylator pathway.","title":"MGMT and MLH1 promoter methylation versus APC, KRAS and BRAF gene mutations in colorectal cancer: indications for distinct pathways and sequence of events.","pubmedId":"19164452"}
