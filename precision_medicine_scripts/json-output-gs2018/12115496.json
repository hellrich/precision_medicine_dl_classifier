Thus, the cellular events that enable the invasive phenotype are under intense investigation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a number of cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and is suspected to contribute to their tumorigenesis. On average, 8% of gastric carcinomas have been shown to carry this virus. To explore whether the presence of EBV in gastric carcinoma contributes to tumor progression in this predominantly invasive carcinoma, we examined a panel of 2 in vitro EBV-infected human gastric cancer cell line sublines and their mock-infected AGS parental control line. We found EBV infection caused a marked increase in transmigration of a Matrigel barrier (415% and 303%, p \u003c 0.05, for the 2 infected lines). This correlated with increased motility of these sublines (233% and 140%, p \u003c 0.05). As this pattern of increased motility leading to a more pronounced enhancement of invasion has been noted in other tumor cells, we explored the roles of autocrine signaling pathways previously implicated in carcinoma motility and invasion. Inhibitors to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (PD153035), phospholipase C (PLC) (U73122), extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (PD089035) and PI-3 kinase (Wortmannin) were not informative. These data suggest that EBV increases migration of AGS cells by a mechanism independent of these autocrine growth factor-induced pathways. Instead, we found that the EBV-infected cells presented increased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation. These findings suggest a role for integrin-mediated signaling in promoting EBV-associated invasiveness.","title":"EBV-expressing AGS gastric carcinoma cell sublines present increased motility and invasiveness.","pubmedId":"12115496"}
