We conducted a multi-institutional study to evaluate the efficacy of temozolomide given after radiotherapy in children with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma and unfavorable low-grade glioma (gliomatosis cerebri or bithalamic involvement). Optional window therapy of intravenous irinotecan (10 doses of 20 mg/m2 per cycle x 2) was given over 6 weeks. The 5-day schedule of temozolomide (200 mg/m2 per day) started 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy and continued for a total of 6 cycles. Thirty-one eligible patients (median age: 12.3 years) participated. Tumors most commonly involved cerebral hemispheres (n \u003d 13, 42%) and thalamus (n \u003d 14, 45%). Whereas six patients underwent radical resection, the remainder had limited surgery, including biopsy (n \u003d 14, 45%). The predominant histologic diagnoses were glioblastoma multiforme (n \u003d 15, 48%) and anaplastic astrocytoma (n \u003d 10, 32%). Two patients had bithalamic grade II astrocytoma. Twenty-seven patients received radiotherapy (median dose: 59.4 Gy), including craniospinal irradiation in 3 because of leptomeningeal spread. Four patients did not receive radiotherapy in this study because of consent withdrawn (n \u003d 2), toxicity during window therapy (n \u003d 1), or at the physician\u0027s discretion (n \u003d 1). Twenty-three patients received 112 cycles of temozolomide therapy. The 2-year progression-free and overall survival estimates were 11 +/- 5% and 21 +/- 7%, respectively. Although the heterogeneity of prognostic factors in our patients made assessment of treatment outcome more difficult, the addition of 6 cycles of temozolomide after radiotherapy did not seem to alter the poor outcome of these patients.","title":"Temozolomide after radiotherapy for newly diagnosed high-grade glioma and unfavorable low-grade glioma in children.","pubmedId":"16200343"}
