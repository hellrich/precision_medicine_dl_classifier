Although PTC is a curable malignancy, many patients relapse             after treatment. Thus, there is a need to identify novel factors involved in the             pathogenesis of PTC that may be used as targets for new therapies. The MAPK pathway             has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PTC. Therefore, in this review, we             summarize the role of the BRAF V600E mutation in the development and progression             of thyroid cancer. The cinical implication of this molecular abnormality is also             discussed. It is evident that the detection of the BRAF V600E mutation is crucial             in order to identify novel avenues for thyroid cancer treatment.","title":"BRAF mutations in papillary thyroid carcinoma and emerging targeted therapies (review).","pubmedId":"22858857"}
