In this study, knockdown of Hmgb1 expression increased apoptosis, reduced invasion and p-NF-κB expression, but increased Klotho protein level in melanoma tumor cells. The effect of Hmgb1 knockdown was overcome by LPS. Introduction of exogenous Hmgb1 significantly decreased apoptosis, increased invasion, elevated p-NF-κB, but lowered Klotho protein level in melanoma cells. The effect of exogenous Hmgb1 was agonized by NF-κB inhibitor CAPE. Hmgb1 knockdown activated, but exogenous Hmgb1 inactivated, p-IGF1R/p-PI3K p-85/p-Akt/p-mTOR signaling. Knockdown of Klotho gene expression significantly decreased apoptosis, increased invasion in melanoma cells, and inhibited xenograft A375 tumor growth. A significantly high percentage of cells stained positive for p-NF-κB, but negative for Klotho, in melanoma tissues compared to normal and benign skin tissues. The positive p-NF-κB and negative Klotho protein expression correlated with poor prognosis in melanoma patients. Multivariate analysis revealed an independent association between p-NF-κB / Klotho protein level and overall survival. In conclusion, Hmgb1 can inhibit Klotho gene expression and malignant phenotype in melanoma cells through activation of NF-κB signaling.","title":"Hmgb1 inhibits Klotho expression and malignant phenotype in melanoma cells by activating NF-κB.","pubmedId":"27779100"}
