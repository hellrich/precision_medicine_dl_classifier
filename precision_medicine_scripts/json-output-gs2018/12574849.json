Tumor cells were spindled or epithelioid and contained glycogen and diastase-resistant PAS-positive granules. There were few mitoses, and necrosis was absent, indicating a benign tumor. The stroma was markedly vascular, and a few adipocytes were seen in one area. Cells were positive for melanocyte and muscle markers. Electron microscopy revealed abundant dense granules. Although melanin was absent histochemically, it was present using a chemical assay, and the granules may, therefore, be atypical melanosomes. Fine actin filaments, attachment plaques and lamina were present. Initial assessment of the lesion indicated malignant melanoma, but the immunostaining and histologic features indicated monotypic angiomyolipoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such case in the nasal cavity.","title":"Monotypic angiomyolipoma of the nasal cavity: a heretofore undescribed occurrence.","pubmedId":"12574849"}
