Melanoma in situ in the earliest stage of melanoma which has been increasingly recognized in our population. We performed a retrospective study of the cases of melanoma in situ diagnosed between 1996 and 2002. Clinical characteristics and detection patterns were examined through the use of a questionnaire submitted to the dermatologist. 53% were males and 47% were women with a mean age of 57 years. The most common skin type was type III (35%). The majority of the lesions were on the head and neck region. Most patients detected their own melanoma (62%) while physicians detected 38%. Self detection occurred irrespective of the anatomic distribution with the exception of those presenting on the trunk area. No relation was found between the lesion size and the detection pattern. Patients younger than 70 year-old were more likely to detect their lesions than patients older than 70 year-old, in whom lesions were more frequently detected by their physicians. Routine skin self examination can improve the detection of melanoma when it is clinically a macule, a curable stage. Techniques about skin cancer prevention and self examination should be emphasized and taught by their physicians so that lesions of melanoma can be diagnosed in their earliest stage.","title":"Melanoma in situ in Puerto Rico: clinical characteristics and detection patterns.","pubmedId":"15631171"}
