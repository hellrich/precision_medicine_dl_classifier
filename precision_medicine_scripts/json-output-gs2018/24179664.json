Most reports indicate success with therapy directed at the tumor as if it was pulmonary small cell carcinoma Primary small cell carcinoma of the breast is an uncommon form of EPSCC. Differentiating between a primary small cell carcinoma of the breast from metastatic disease to the breast is very important. According to the literature, there have been approximately 70 cases reported worldwide. Of these cases, only two cases are documented in men. Prognosis is varied and depends on stage of disease at presentation. A combination of surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation is required to adequately treat patients with small cell carcinoma of the breast. We present a case of a male patient diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma first and then subsequently diagnosed with a concurrent small cell carcinoma of the breast responding to treatment with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation.
