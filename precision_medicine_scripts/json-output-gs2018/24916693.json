Apart from the loss of tumor-suppressor functions, TP53 mutations may result in gain of function favoring cellular proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and genomic instability. Some TP53 mutations are more likely to affect the course of the disease than others.","title":"TP53 mutations and lung cancer: not all mutations are created equal.","pubmedId":"24916693"}
