To verify whether altered CDKN2a expression is involved in the pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides (MF), we examined mRNA expression in 20 patients with MF by RT-PCR and dot blot hybridization. CDKN2a mRNA expression was undetectable in 5 of the 20 patients (25%), intermediate in 13 (65%) and high in 2 (10%). Immunohistochemical studies, which were performed in ten patients, revealed that in the four patients showing no mRNA, p16INK4a was expressed in \u003c1% of neoplastic lymphocytes whereas in the four patients with an intermediate mRNA level, specific nuclear staining was present in 1-25% of tumor cells. In the two patients with high levels of CDKN2a mRNA, \u003e25% of neoplastic lymphocytes stained positively. No direct correlation between clinicopathological and molecular findings was evident in our patients. DNA mutational analysis revealed no alterations in a total of six patients examined. Our results indicate that the lack of CDKN2a expression, as found in 25% of the patients, may have a pathogenetic role in MF even though the absence of CDKN2a mRNA was not associated with point mutations or minor gene deletions.","title":"Reduced expression of CDKN2a/P16INK4a in mycosis fungoides.","pubmedId":"10335917"}
