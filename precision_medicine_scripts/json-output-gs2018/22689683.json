Thus, in this study we investigated the effect of the combination of sorafenib plus nutlin-3 in acute myeloid leukemia.\nPrimary acute myeloid leukemia blasts (n\u003d13) and FLT3(wild-type)/p53(wild-type) (OCI-AML3), FLT3(mutated)/p53(wild-type) (MOLM), FLT3(mutated)/p53(mutated) (MV4-11), FLT3(wild-type)/p53(deleted) (HL60) or FLT3(wild-type)/p53(mutated) (NB4) acute myeloid cell lines were exposed to sorafenib, used alone or in association with nutlin-3 at a 1:1 ratio, in a range of clinically achievable concentrations (1-10 Î¼M). Induction of apoptosis and autophagy was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and by specific flow cytometry analyses. The levels of Mcl-1, p53 and Bak proteins were analyzed by western blotting. Knock-down of Bax and Bak gene expression was performed in transfection experiments with specific short interfering RNA.\nThe sorafenib+nutlin-3 drug combination exhibits synergistic cytotoxicity in primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts and in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines with maximal cytotoxicity in FLT3(mutated) MV4-11 and MOLM, followed by the FLT3(wild-type) OCI-AML3, HL60 and NB4 cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of sorafenib+nutlin-3 was characterized by an increase of both apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, Bax and Bak showed prominent roles in mediating the decrease of cell viability in response to the drug combination in p53(wild-type) OCI-AML3 and p53(deleted) HL-60 cells, respectively, as demonstrated in transfection experiments performed with specific short interfering RNA.\nOur data demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia cells show a variable but overall good susceptibility to the innovative therapeutic combination of sorafenib+nutlin-3, which differentially involves the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak in p53(wild-type) and p53(deleted) cells.","title":"The sorafenib plus nutlin-3 combination promotes synergistic cytotoxicity in acute myeloid leukemic cells irrespectively of FLT3 and p53 status.","pubmedId":"22689683"}
