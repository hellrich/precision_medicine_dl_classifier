However, it remains unclear whether or not BRAF mutation is associated with any particular stage of melanoma progression. Tumor biopsy specimens from patients with melanoma were analyzed to determine whether the frequency of BRAF mutation in metastatic melanoma differed from primary melanoma. BRAF mutation was present in 15 of 23 (61%) patients with primary melanoma and in 7 of 12 (58%) patients with metastatic melanoma. These results suggest that BRAF mutation in melanoma is most likely to occur prior to the development of metastatic disease.","title":"Analysis of BRAF mutation in primary and metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"16096377"}
