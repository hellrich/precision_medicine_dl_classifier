Immunohistochemical staining of c-Met, p16, and EGFR was performed. c-Met expression was correlated with p16, EGFR, clinical characteristics, and clinical endpoints including locoregional control (LRC), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).\nFifty-one percent of patients were positive for p16, and 53% were positive for EGFR. Both p16-negative (Pâ‰¤.001) and EGFR-positive (P\u003d.019) status predicted for worse DFS. Ninety-three percent of patients stained positive for c-Met. Patients were divided into low (0, 1, or 2+ intensity) or high (3+ intensity) c-Met expression. On univariate analysis, high c-Met expression predicted for worse LRC (hazard ratio [HR] 2.27; 95% CI, 1.08-4.77; P\u003d.031), DM (HR 4.41; 95% CI, 1.56-12.45; P\u003d.005), DFS (HR 3.00; 95% CI, 1.68-5.38; P\u003c.001), and OS (HR 4.35; 95% CI, 2.13-8.88; P\u003c.001). On multivariate analysis, after adjustment for site, T stage, smoking history, and EGFR status, only high c-Met expression (P\u003d.011) and negative p16 status (P\u003d.003) predicted for worse DFS. High c-Met expression was predictive of worse DFS in both EGFR-positive (P\u003d.032) and -negative (P\u003d.008) patients. In the p16-negative patients, those with high c-Met expression had worse DFS (P\u003d.036) than did those with low c-Met expression. c-Met expression was not associated with any outcome in the p16-positive patients.\nc-Met is expressed in the majority of locally advanced HNSCC cases, and high c-Met expression predicts for worse clinical outcomes. High c-Met expression predicted for worse DFS in p16-negative patients but not in p16-positive patients. c-Met predicted for worse outcome regardless of EGFR status.","title":"c-Met expression is a marker of poor prognosis in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiation.","pubmedId":"24521684"}
