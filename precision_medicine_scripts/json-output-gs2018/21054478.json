Clinical and biochemical evaluation of gene carriers was also performed.\nWe discovered an unsuspected germline RET mutation in 47 of 729 (6路5%) apparently sporadic MTC who were re-classified as hereditary. We found 60 of 146 (41路1%) gene carriers, 35 of whom had biochemical or clinical evidence of MTC. Thirty gene carriers underwent total thyroidectomy and 27 of 30 (90%) were persistently cured after a mean follow-up of 6路0 years. As a further result of RET genetic screening, we observed a significantly higher prevalence of familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC) in our series with respect to the largest series of the International RET Consortium (P \u003d 0路0002).\nRET genetic screening of patients with apparently sporadic MTC represents a major tool for the preclinical diagnosis and early treatment of unsuspected affected family members and allows the identification of a relevant percentage of hidden FMTC.","title":"RET genetic screening of sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) allows the preclinical diagnosis of unsuspected gene carriers and the identification of a relevant percentage of hidden familial MTC (FMTC).","pubmedId":"21054478"}
