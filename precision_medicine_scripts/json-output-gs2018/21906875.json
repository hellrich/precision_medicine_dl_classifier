Nearly nothing is known about PI3K alterations in GISTs and only a few GISTs with BRAF mutations have been reported. BRAF mutations (V600E) were found in 3/87 tumors (3.5%) concomitantly were wild type for KIT and PDGFRA. No mutations were detected in KRAS, NRAS, and FGFR3. For the first-time we demonstrated a PIK3CA mutation (H1047L) simultaneously occurring with a 15-bp deletion in KIT exon 11 in one tumor. We suggest that BRAF mutations are of pathogenetic significance in wild type GISTs. The PI3K pathway should be assessed in future studies.","title":"Spectrum of KIT/PDGFRA/BRAF mutations and Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase pathway gene alterations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).","pubmedId":"21906875"}
