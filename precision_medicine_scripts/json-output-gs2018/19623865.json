Cytologic findings were collected from 10508 patients that underwent ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the thyroid. Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis was found in 2156 (20.5%) and papillary carcinoma in 269 (2.6%) of 10508 patients with FNAC, whereas both Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma were present in 42 (0.4%) patients. Among patients with FNAC diagnosis of Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis, the prevalence of papillary carcinoma was 1.9%. Among patients with FNAC diagnosis of papillary carcinoma, the prevalence of Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis was 15.6%. There was no statistically significant association between the presence of papillary carcinoma and Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis in patients undergoing FNAC (p\u003d0.0522). In conclusion, in a large series of patients, the incidence of Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma coexistence in cytologic material was 0.4%. There was no statistically significant relationship between Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma in cytologic material.","title":"Coexistence of papillary carcinoma and Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis.","pubmedId":"19623865"}
