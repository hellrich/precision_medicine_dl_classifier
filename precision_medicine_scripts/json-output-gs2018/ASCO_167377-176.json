However, not all the HPV+ LA HNSCCs are curable, and some of them shows poor prognosis. The purpose of this study is to identify poor prognostic factors in HPV+ LA HNSCC patients. Methods: Patients who were diagnosed as LA HNSCC and tested for HPV status from 2000 to 2015 were included in this retrospective analysis. Demographic data (age, gender), smoking status, comorbidity, and clinical information about stage, pathology, type of definite treatment were obtained. HPV typing was conducted using HPV DNA genotyping chip or liquid bead microarray. Expression of p16 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done with factors associated with overall survival (OS) by Cox regression analysis. Results: One hundred fifty two HPV+ LA HNSCC patients were included in this study. Male patients were 82.2% and 43.4% were current or ex-smoker. Oropharyngeal cancer was 84.2%. In univariate analysis, old age, poor performance, non-oropharynx, advanced T stage (T3, 4), N0 stage, HPV genotype 18 were significantly associated with poor OS. Smoking was not associated with OS. In multivariate analysis, poor performance (ECOG PS1), non-oropharyngeal location were independently associated with shorter overall survival (HR 4.82, p \u003d 0.003; HR 7.36, p \u003d 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, HPV genotype 18 positivity was also independent poor prognostic factor for OS in HPV+ LA HNSCC (HR 11.41, p \u003c 0.001). Conclusions: Non-oropharyngeal cancer, poor performance status, HPV genotype 18 were independent poor prognostic factors in HPV+ LA HNSCC. These patients should not be candidate of de-escalated treatment.","title":"Poor prognostic factors in human papilloma virus-positive head and neck cancer: Who should not be candidate of de-escalated treatment?","pubmedId":"ASCO_167377-176"}
