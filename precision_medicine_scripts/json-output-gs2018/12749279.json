The aim of this study was to compare pathologic and prognostic data of gastric remnant cancer with those of primary proximal gastric cancer including upper gastric cancer based on a recent 15-year experience at a single institute in Japan.\nAmong 698 patients who underwent gastrectomy for cancer between 1984 and 1998, 15 (2.1%) were patients with gastric remnant cancer. During the same period, 139 patients underwent primary gastrectomy for proximal gastric cancer which included 71 with upper gastric cancer confined to the upper one-third of the stomach. Clinicopathologic findings of gastric remnant cancer were compared with those of proximal gastric cancer.\nOf 15 gastric remnant cancers, 8 (53%) were stage I tumors. Although gastric remnant cancer and proximal gastric cancer was not different in several clinicopathologic factors, gastric remnant cancer and upper gastric cancer confined to the upper one-third of the stomach was different with regard to the frequency of tumor size \u003e or \u003d 4 cm (60% vs. 32%, p \u003c 0.05), poorly differentiated type (67% vs. 38%, p \u003c 0.05), serosal invasion (40% vs. 11%, p \u003c 0.01), lymph node metastasis (47% vs. 20%, p \u003c 0.05), stage III or IV disease (47% vs. 10%, p \u003c 0.01), and noncurative gastrectomy (20% vs. 1%, p \u003c 0.01). The 5-year survival rate of gastric remnant cancer (69%) was higher than that of proximal gastric cancer (57%) and lower than that of upper gastric cancer (81%), although the differences were not statistically significant.\nIn our recent series, a half of gastric remnant cancers are stage I tumors. Although gastric remnant cancers are similar to proximal gastric cancers, they are more advanced and their surgical results are less satisfactory when compared with upper gastric cancers confined to the upper one-third of the stomach.","title":"Gastric remnant cancer compared with primary proximal gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"12749279"}
