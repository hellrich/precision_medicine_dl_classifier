We observed that tumor location and the protein expressions of Jagged1 and RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) have significantly association with the lymph node metastasis. We further investigated the mechanism of interaction between Jagged1 and PKR, and demonstrated that induction of PKR promotes Jagged1 protein degradation through proteasome system in lung cancer cells. We also found that combination of Jagged1 with PKR improved prognostic value in all stages NSCLC patients. However, combination of Jagged1 with PKR did not improve lymph node metastatic value. Taken together, our data suggest that PKR and Jagged1 are independent markers for predicting lymph node metastasis, and PKR may reduce lymph node metastasis partly by promote Jagged1 proteins degradation in NSCLC patients.","title":"PKR and Jagged1 associated with lymph node metastasis in lung cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2261"}
