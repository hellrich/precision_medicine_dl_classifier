Deficiency of Pten, one of the most commonly mutated genes in cancer, directly triggers a senescence program critically depending on the p19Arf-p53 fail-safe pathway. We identified a novel and unexpected tumor suppressive role of IL-6/Stat3 signaling in a Pten-deficient murine prostate cancer model. Our data provide evidence that activation of IL-6/Stat3 signaling axis is implicated in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Strikingly, genetic ablation of IL-6 strongly promoted prostate cancer initiation, progression and metastasis in Pten-deficient mice. Mechanistically, IL6/Stat3 signaling regulates p19Arf-p53-induced senescence by modulating expression of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 in pre-neoplastic cells. Critically, in prostate cancer patients low expression of Stat3 or p14Arf, the human homologue of p19Arf, correlates with poor survival. Therefore, the IL-6/Stat3 signaling axis may represent a novel molecular target for senescence-based cancer therapies.","title":"IL-6/Stat3 signaling is an indispensable modulator of oncogene-induced cellular senescence","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3138"}
