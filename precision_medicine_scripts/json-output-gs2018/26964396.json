(SJS). A 56-year old female visited our hospital complaining of right cheek pain. Local examination revealed that the right ostium of the maxillary sinus was open and that the maxillary sinus mucosa was invaded by tumor. Biopsy revealed a histopathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. We therefore diagnosed the patient as a case of maxillary sinus carcinoma (T3N0M0) based on the CT, MRI and FDG-PET findings. During chemoradiotherapy for maxillary sinus cancer, the patient developed oral mucosal inflammation of progressively worsening severity; we initially thought that the symptom was a side effect of the treatment; however, several days later, skin lesions appeared throughout the body. We consulted a dermatologist, who suspected SJS. The patient was initiated on high-dose steroid therapy (steroid pulse therapy), and the symptoms improved. Because of SJS is a fatal drug eruption, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important. In patients receiving chemoradiotherapy showing severe oral mucosal inflammation outside the irradiation area or oral mucosal inflammation associated with skin lesions throughout the body, it is necessary to bear in mind the possibility of SJS.","title":"[A Case of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Developing during Chemoradiotherapy for Maxillary Sinus Cancer].","pubmedId":"26964396"}
