Therefore, we assessed association of esophageal cancer (EC), its clinical characteristics, and environmental interactions with these polymorphisms in 174 patients with EC and 196 controls. No association of EGFR 497Arg/Arg genotype was observed (OR 1.48, p \u003d 0.067) but EGF +61A/A genotype was significantly associated with risk of EC (OR 1.65, p \u003d 0.025), particularly in males (OR 1.76, p \u003d 0.031). Patients with EGF +61A/A genotype were at risk for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (OR 1.70, p \u003d 0.021) and tumor at upper anatomical location (OR 3.11, p \u003d 0.009). Interaction of EGF or EGFR genotypes with environmental exposure did not modulate EC risk. However, in gene-gene interaction, EGFR 497Arg/Arg*EGF +61A/A showed significant risk for EC (OR 2.47, p \u003d 0.011). In conclusion, EGF +61A\u003eG gene polymorphisms influenced EC susceptibility and its clinical characteristics. Gene-gene interaction of EGFR 497Arg\u003eLys and EGF +61A\u003eG polymorphisms enhanced risk for EC, indicating additive effects.","title":"Interaction of EGFR 497Arg\u003eLys with EGF +61A\u003eG polymorphism: modulation of risk in esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"18773861"}
