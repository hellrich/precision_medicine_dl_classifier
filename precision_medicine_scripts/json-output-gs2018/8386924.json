Eighteen of these patients had a solitary metastasis and all were treated as curable. Ten patients presented with synchronous lung and brain disease. Of the remaining 10, nine initially presented with the lung tumour, which was treated first. There was a zero operative mortality rate and median survival was 12 months with reasonable quality of life for this time.","title":"Craniotomy and thoracotomy for non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with cerebral metastasis.","pubmedId":"8386924"}
