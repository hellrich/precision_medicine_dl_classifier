This study was to detect FLT3 gene expression, and FLT3/ITD gene mutation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)patients, and analyze their relationships with prognosis.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR)was used to detect FLT3 gene expression, and FLT3/ITD gene mutation in 53 CML patients of chronic phase,and 34 CML patients of accelerated phase or blast crisis.\nFLT3 gene was detected in 5.7%(3/53)CML patients of chronic phase, and in 55.9% (19/34)CML patients of accelerated phase or blast crisis,the difference of FLT3 gene positive rate between these 2 groups was significant (P\u003c 0.001). Only 2 of 87 CML patients (2.3%)were found with FLT3/ITD mutation.\nFTL3 gene expresses mainly in CML patients of accelerated phase or blast crisis. FTL3/ITD gene mutation was seldom involved in CML patients. The CML patients with FLT3 gene expression and FTL3/ITD gene mutation may have poor prognosis.","title":"[Detection of FLT3 gene and FLT3/ITD gene mutation in chronic myeloid leukemia and its significance].","pubmedId":"15473940"}
