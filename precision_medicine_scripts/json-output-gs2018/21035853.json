In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), p16(INK4a) methylation has been associated with advanced disease stage and higher IPI. The prognostic impact of p16(INK4a) methylation in DLBCL remains unclear; however, it has been suggested to correlate with inferior outcome. To further investigate the clinical impact of p16(INK4a) methylation in DLBCL, promoter methylation of this gene was assessed quantitatively by pyrosequencing. Forty-two of 113 (37%) DLBCL patients with methylation level above 5% were categorized as methylated and subsequently divided into low, intermediate and high methylation categories. Overall, no association was shown between the extent of p16(INK4a) methylation and patients\u0027 clinical characteristics, except disease stage (P\u003d0.049). Moreover, we could not reveal any impact of p16(INK4a) methylation on lymphoma-specific survival. Although \u003e25% of p16(INK4a) methylation correlated with a better progression-free survival (P\u003d0.048) in patients \u003c65 years old, the significance of this finding, if any, needs to be further investigated. In conclusion, our finding questions the role of p16(INK4a) promoter methylation as a negative prognostic factor in DLBCL.","title":"Quantitative evaluation of p16(INK4a) promoter methylation using pyrosequencing in de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"21035853"}
