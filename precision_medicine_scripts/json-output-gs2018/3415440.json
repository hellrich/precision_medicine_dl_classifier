The sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of three LDH isoenzyme factors (LDH-1, greater than 90 U/L; LDH-1 greater than LDH-2; LDH-1/LDH ratio, greater than 0.4) for diagnosing AMI were assessed in three groups of patients according to total serum LDH values--group A, LDH level over 600 U/L; group B, 400 to 599 U/L; group C, 225 to 399 U/L--and in five groups of patients according to the time after admission--(1) first 48 hours; (2) three to five days; (3) six to eight days; (4) nine to 11 days; (5) 12 to 15 days. All three factors were found to be highly efficient for diagnosing AMI (91.5% to 97.5%) in groups A and B, but the most efficient factor in each group was LDH-1 value above 90 U/L. In group C, the only efficient factor was the LDH-1 value over 90 U/L (96%). The most efficient factor for diagnosing AMI in relation to time after admission up to 15 days after AMI was the LDH-1 value over 90 U/L (96% to 97.5%). The factors LDH-1 greater than LDH-2 and LDH-1/LDH above 0.4 were more efficient in patients up to five days after AMI (91.5% to 97.5%) than in patients six to 15 days after admission. We conclude that the most efficient LDH value for diagnosing AMI is the absolute value of LDH-1 above 90 U/L. Its superiority over other LDH isoenzyme values is best documented in a group of patients six to 15 days after admission and with only slight to moderate elevation of total serum LDH values (225 to 399 U/L).","title":"The efficiency of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme determination for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.","pubmedId":"3415440"}
