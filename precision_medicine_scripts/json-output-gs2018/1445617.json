The ampoules content was dissolved in a mixture water/ethanol (50/50) and first-derivative spectra were recorded. The absolute values of the derivative at 312 nm for the determination of Calcium Leucovorin and between 244 and 246 nm for the determination of parabens were measured. The method is linear, quantitative and reproducible.","title":"Simultaneous quantitative determination of calcium leucovorin and parabens in lyophilized ampoules by derivative spectroscopy.","pubmedId":"1445617"}
