In both the t.i.d. administration group and the single-dose administration group, plasma TOR and TOR-1 concentrations reached a constant state within 2 weeks after administration was started. Under the constant state, plasma TOR concentrations were 1,493.3 +/- 120.3 ng/ml in the t.i.d. administration group and 1,348 +/- 341.0 ng/ml in the single-dose administration group. Plasma TOR-1 concentrations were 2,378.3 +/- 186.5 ng/ml in the t.i.d. administration group and 2,144 +/- 475.3 ng/ml in the single-dose administration group. In both groups, plasma TOR-1 concentrations were 2 or more times higher than plasma TOR concentrations. These results show there were no differences in plasma concentrations between administration of 120 mg/day of toremifene citrate in divided daily doses (t.i.d.) and in a single daily dose. The two administration methods appear to produce clinically similar actions.","title":"[Plasma concentrations of toremifene citrate and N-desmethyltoremifene in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer--comparison of 120 mg of toremifene citrate administered once a day and divided into 3 separate doses (t.i.d.)].","pubmedId":"10700895"}
