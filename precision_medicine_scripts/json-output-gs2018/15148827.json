Endocrinologically she showed high levels of plasma ACTH and cortisol, which were not suppressed by high dose dexamethasone, elevated serum parathyroid hormone and markedly increased daily urinary excretion of catecholamines. She died of sepsis, and postmortem examination was performed. A left adrenal pheochromocytoma, which was immunohistochemically proven to be ACTH producing, a papillary thyroid carcinoma and parathyroid adenomas were found. To our knowledge this is the first report of coexistence of these three endocrine tumors in a single patient.","title":"[Multiple endocrine neoplasia].","pubmedId":"15148827"}
