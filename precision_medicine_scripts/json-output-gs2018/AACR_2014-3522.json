Inactivating germline mutations of BAP1 predispose to multiple cancers including uveal and cutaneous melanoma as well as malignant mesothelioma. In the present study we document a family with a novel germline mutation of BAP1 (g.1777C\u003eT) that results in expression of a truncated BAP1 protein. Family members with this mutation demonstrated a primary clinical phenotype of autosomal dominant, early-onset melanocytic neoplasms with immunohistochemistry (IHC) of these tumors demonstrating lack of BAP1 protein expression. In addition, family members harboring the BAP1 germline mutation developed other neoplastic disease such as thyroid cancer and pancreatic cancer. IHC analysis of these cancers also demonstrated loss of BAP1 protein expression. Our investigation identifies a new BAP1 mutation, further underscores the relevance of BAP1 as a clinically important tumor suppressor gene and broadens the range of cancers associated with BAP1 inactivation. Further study will be required to understand the full scope of BAP1-associated neoplastic disease.","title":"A novel BAP1 mutation is associated with melanocytic neoplasms and thyroid and pancreatic cancers","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3522"}
