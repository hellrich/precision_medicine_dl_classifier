Animals (Wistar strain rats) were divided into 6 groups according to their ages; 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 days. Both LH and FSH levels in serum increased significantly in response to ovariectomy in all age-groups studied when measured one week postoperatively, though in the rats aged 10-15 days the increase in FSH following castration was only slight. In rats older than 25 days, the postcastration gonadotropin rise, calculated as a percent increase from the basal figure, decreased gradually with increasing age. Ovariectomized rats injected with estradiol benzoate (EB, 5 micrograms/100 g BW) showed significantly lower levels of both LH and FSH than those in castrated controls. However, the inhibitory action of EB on postcastration gonadotropin output was found to be relatively less effective in rats older than 25 days. Ovariectomized rats primed with EB were again injected with a 2nd dose of EB (5 micrograms/100 g BW) at noon 3 days after priming. The 2nd EB injection induced a significant rise in LH 6 h later in 30- and 35-day-old, though not in younger, animals. On the other hand, the FSH response to EB was markedly enhanced during days 15-25 of age. These results indicate that the estrogen negative feedback action on gonadotropin release is already operating in female rats at a very early age, and that the brain sensitivity to estrogen decreases slightly during the late prepubertal phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Maturation of negative and positive estrogen feedback in the prepubertal female rat.","pubmedId":"6420142"}
