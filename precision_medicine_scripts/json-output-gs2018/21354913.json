A survival analysis was also performed in relation to EGFR and c-Met expressions.\nThe relative copy numbers of EGFR and c-Met were positively correlated (r\u003d0.352, P\u003d0.005). The levels of these two genes in smokers were 0.15 and 0.14, respectively, significantly higher than those in non-smokers (P\u003c0.05); their levels were 0.16 and 0.14 in adenocarcinoma, respectively, significantly higher than those in squamous carcinomas (P\u003c0.05). In patients with squamous carcinomas, a higher level of EGFR and c-Met DNA copies was associated with poorer prognosis, and Log Rank analysis indicated a survival difference in relation to EGFR and c-Met DNA copies (P\u003d0.015, P\u003d0.046).\nEGFR and c-Met may interact in a synergistic manner in the oncogenesis and development of NSCLC, and may help in the prognostic evaluation of squamous carcinomas.","title":"[Detection of epidermal growth factor receptor and c-Met gene copies for prognostic evaluation of non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"21354913"}
