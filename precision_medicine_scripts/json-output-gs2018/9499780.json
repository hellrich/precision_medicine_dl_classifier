The prognostic accuracy was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.\nThe log PC-10 count, vascular networks, mean of the largest nucleoli, largest tumor diameter, age of patient, and prognostic index were independently associated with outcome. However, each of these indicators had no more than a poor-to-moderate predictive accuracy, and only the prognostic index was significantly better than the largest tumor diameter.\nThe PC-10 count retains a prognostic value in uveal melanoma when adjusting for the effect of the mean of the largest nucleoli and diverse vascular patterns. A prognostic index combining two or more indicators may improve the predictive precision.","title":"Prognostic accuracy of the mean of the largest nucleoli, vascular patterns, and PC-10 in posterior uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"9499780"}
