The neoplasms included pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; n \u003d 59) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC; n \u003d 649). The latter were all node negative and stratified into IDC combined (n \u003d 237) or not combined (n \u003d 412) with a \"significant amount\" of DCIS (defined as DCIS greater than or equal to 10% of total tumor cellularity). Overexpression of HER-2/neu was not observed in any of the hyperplastic or dysplastic lesions. In contrast, it was present in 56% of pure DCIS and in 77% of the comedo subtype of this group. Only 15% of IDC overexpressed HER-2/neu. However, the rate of overexpression was significantly higher in the subset of IDC combined with DCIS compared with the subset of IDC not combined with DCIS (22% v 11%, respectively; P less than .0001). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that HER-2/neu plays a more important role in initiation than in progression of ductal carcinomas. They also suggest that overexpression decreases within individual tumors as they evolve from in situ to increasingly invasive lesions or, alternatively, that many invasive carcinomas arise de novo (ie, without progressing through a significant in situ stage) by mechanisms not involving HER-2/neu. In addition, overexpression of HER-2/neu was associated with several poor prognostic features (younger patient age, premenopause, negative estrogen receptor status, negative progesterone receptor status, and high nuclear grade) in the subset of IDC combined with DCIS. With one exception (negative estrogen receptor status) these associations were lost in IDC not combined with DCIS, also suggesting that the role of HER-2/neu changes during the progression of human breast cancer.","title":"Overexpression of HER-2/neu and its relationship with other prognostic factors change during the progression of in situ to invasive breast cancer.","pubmedId":"1355464"}
