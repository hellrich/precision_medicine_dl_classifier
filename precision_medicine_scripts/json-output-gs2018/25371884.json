It has excellent prognosis and a favorable clinical course. In addition, adenoid basal carcinoma is differentiated from adenoid cystic carcinoma by histologic and cellular morphologies, and immunohistochemistry. In this paper, we present the case of a 22 year old Korean female. She initially had a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) on Pap smear and a subsequent cervical loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) specimen revealing adenoid basal carcinoma. The lesion showed the histologic characteristics of adenoid basal carcinoma. Because of the lesion\u0027s low potential for recurrence and metastasis, the young primipara had a conization procedure performed and has been under close observation.
