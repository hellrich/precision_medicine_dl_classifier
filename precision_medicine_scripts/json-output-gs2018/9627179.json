The goal of this study was to examine the clinical value of immunohistochemical (IHC) RB detection and its relationship to mdm2 overexpression in a cohort of 198 adult primary soft-tissue sarcomas (STS). RB overexpression reveals, multivariately, a correlation with survival (RR\u003d1.59, P\u003d0.037) as well as mdm2 positivity (RR\u003d2.32, P\u003d0.0035). Stratification of RB results to mdm2 staining shows a prognostic graduation in four levels. Patients with positivity for both antibodies have the highest risk (RR\u003d3.30, P\u003d0.002) and the poorest prognosis (projected 5-year survival rate, 18.6%); those with negativity for both antibodies show the most favourable prognosis (projected 5-year survival rate, 63.4%). Intermediately, an isolated RB overexpression (projected 5-year survival rate, 46.1%) is more favourable than an isolated mdm2 positivity (projected 5-year survival rate, 33.5%). To sum up, this study proves that RB and mdm2 overexpression have an individual and also an additive effect on prognosis in STS.","title":"Significance of retinoblastoma and mdm2 gene expression as prognostic markers for soft-tissue sarcoma.","pubmedId":"9627179"}
