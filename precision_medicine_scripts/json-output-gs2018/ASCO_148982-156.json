Blood-based, serial monitoring of BRAF and other mutations during therapy may be useful to inform time-critical treatment decisions. Plasma contains at least two sources of cell-free nucleic acids (NAs): exosomal RNA (exoRNA) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Combining exoRNA and cfDNA maximizes the yield of genetic material from plasma, and may enable monitoring of both biologically important sources to enhance mutation detection sensitivity and help match patients to targeted therapies.   Methods:    Blood was drawn from 10 metastatic MM patients for analysis prior to therapy initiation and up to 8 serial time points. Subsequent purification of high-quality NAs using a novel, spin-column based method (EXO52) to co-isolate all exoRNA and cfDNA allowed analysis of mutations present in both NA fractions by ultra-deep sequencing. A custom next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation method, with a novel bioinformatics pipeline to efficiently call the rare mutations, was used to analyze a panel of 9 mutation hotspots from 6 genes, including BRAF. Data were correlated with tissue-based mutational analysis, treatment information, and RECIST-defined response assessments.   Results:    Somatic mutations from MM tumors were readily detected in both exoRNA and cfDNA from plasma. We show that the BRAF mutation signal from patient blood reduces with BRAF inhibitor treatment and is detectable in plasma prior to observed clinical and radiographic progression. Further, mutation signal from exoRNA consistently exceeds that from cfDNA across timepoints, with rate of change during response or relapse also showing differences. Possible clinical relevance of the BRAF exoRNA:cfDNA ratio will be discussed.  Conclusions:    Co-isolation of circulating exoRNA and cfDNA with EXO52 and subsequent NGS using a targeted gene panel provides a highly sensitive approach to monitor for BRAF and other somatic mutations in MM patients over the course of treatment, and has clinical utility.","title":"Plasma-based monitoring of BRAF mutations during therapy for malignant melanoma (MM) using combined exosomal RNA and cell-free DNA analysis.","pubmedId":"ASCO_148982-156"}
