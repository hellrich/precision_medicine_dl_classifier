Here, we report that loss of the remaining normal ABL1 allele in these tumors, which results from cryptic interstitial deletion in 9q34 in patients who did not achieve a complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) during treatment, engenders a novel unexpected mechanism of imatinib resistance. BCR-ABL1-positive Abl1(-/-) leukemia cells were refractory to imatinib as indicated by persistent BCR-ABL1-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, lack of BCR-ABL1 protein degradation, increased cell survival, and clonogenic activity. Expression of ABL1 kinase, but not a kinase-dead mutant, restored the antileukemic effects of imatinib in ABL1-negative chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells and in BCR-ABL1-positive Abl1(-/-) murine leukemia cells. The intracellular concentration of imatinib and expression of its transporters were not affected, although proteins involved in BCR-ABL1 degradation were downregulated in Abl1(-/-) cells. Furthermore, 12 genes associated with imatinib resistance were favorably deregulated in Abl1(-/-) leukemia. Taken together, our results indicate that loss of the normal ABL1 kinase may serve as a key prognostic factor that exerts major impact on CML treatment outcomes.","title":"Imatinib sensitivity in BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia cells is regulated by the remaining normal ABL1 allele.","pubmedId":"21693657"}
