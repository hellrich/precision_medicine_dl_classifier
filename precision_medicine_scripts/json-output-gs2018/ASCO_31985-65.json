Paraffin embedded post- chemo pathological specimens were collected in the 490 non complete responder patients for tissue expression of the putative biomarker beta-tubulin III (bTubIII).Methods: 423 surgical pathological specimens with enough remaining viable tumor tissue after neoadjuvant chemo were processed for immunohistochemistry as published in the Bio-IALT study. A semi-quantitative score was attributed taking account the number of stained cells and the intensity of staining. Semi-quantitative scores were studied as continuous variables, without any pre- determined cut-off. Multivariate analysis for progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were corrected with Bonferroni-Holm method for multiple analyses. Median follow-up was 42 months.Results: bTubIII was the only IHC marker significantly associated with poor PFS in univariate (p\u003d0.014) or multivariate analysis, adjusted for histology, T and stage (HR\u003d 1.50 [1.07-2.10] ; p\u003d0.020). In patients with a pathological specimen showing a bTubIII positive immunostaining, median PFS was 30.6 months, versus 60.1 months (HR\u003d1.46 [1.08-1.99]) for bTubIII negative patients. bTubIII IHC score remained predictive of poor OS in univariate (p\u003d 0.0065) as in multivariate analysis (p\u003d0.019 with Bonferroni correction, HR\u003d1.75 [1.15-2.68] ). Median OS was not reached for bTubIII negative patients whereas it was 71.7 months in patients with bTubIII immunostaining of any intensity score (HR\u003d1.61, [1.11-2.35]).Conclusions: This study showed a dramatic negative prognostic impact for bTubIII immunostaining in resectable early lung cancer. A subset of bTubIII expressing patients with poor prognosis did not take any advantage from perioperative chemo. Hence, those patients could rather have beneficiated from personalized adjuvant treatment with alternative approaches.","title":"Evaluation of class III beta-tubulin (bTubIII) expression as a prognostic marker in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated by perioperative chemotherapy (CT) in the phase III trial IFCT-0002.","pubmedId":"ASCO_31985-65"}
