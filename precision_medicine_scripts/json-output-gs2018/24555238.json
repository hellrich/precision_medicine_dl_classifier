We evaluated the efficacy of post-operative radiotherapy with or without concomitant and/or adjuvant temozolomide in patient, aged \u003e or \u003d 60 years to assess survival and identify prognostic factors of survival.\nA retrospective analysis of overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme aged \u003e or \u003d 60 years treated with post-operative radiotherapy with or without temozolomide chemotherapy was conducted at our institutions. Prognostic factors were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses.\nOf 75 study participants (54.7% male; median age at first diagnosis, 65.1 years), 29 (38.7%) underwent gross total resection, whereas others underwent partial resection or biopsy only. All but 1 patient received radiotherapy. Twenty patients received concomitant temozolomic e only. Adjuvant temozolomide (1-50 cycles) was administered in 42 patients; 16 received \u003e or \u003d 6 cycles. Median overall survival was 10.3 months. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 42.6% and 6.7%, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months. Radiochemotherapy was generally well tolerated. Median overall survival was 15.3 and 29.6 months for patients who received 6-12 cycles and \u003e12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, respectively. There were no significant differences in overall survival between age groups (60-64, 65-69, and \u003e or \u003d 70 years). Adjuvant temozolomide, Karnofsky performance status \u003e or \u003d 70, and additional surgery after progression were significant prognostic factors of longer overall survival (p\u003c0.05).\nRadiochemotherapy, including \u003e or \u003d 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, was safe and prolonged survival of glioblastoma patients aged \u003e or \u003d 60 years. Aggressive therapy should not be withheld from patients aged \u003e or \u003d 60 years with good performance status because of age.","title":"Post-operative management of primary glioblastoma multiforme in patients over 60 years of age.","pubmedId":"24555238"}
