Thirty-four of 143 cases (24%) stained positively. Patients with angiostatin-positive tumors survived longer (146 weeks) than patients with angiostatin-negative tumors (77 weeks; log-rank test: P \u003d 0.07; rank-sum test: P \u003d 0.02). To determine whether combining stimulating and inhibiting factors might improve the prognostic capability, both angiostatin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were analyzed together with respect to patient survival. The median survival time of patients with angiostatin-positive/VEGF-negative carcinomas was 184 weeks, whereas the median survival time of patients with angiostatin-negative/VEGF-positive tumors was only 52 weeks. The angiostatin-positive tumors exhibited an increased incidence of apoptosis and a reduced capability to be transplanted into nude mice, but these differences did not reach or were only of borderline statistical significance.","title":"Angiostatin expression in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"10955809"}
