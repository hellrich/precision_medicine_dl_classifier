In these situations the use of radiotherapy with fast neutrons (densely ionizing radiation with high energy transfer) results in absence of recurrences in approx. 70% of the cases, according to data in the literature. The advantage of using neutrons lies in their greater biological effect on slowly growing tumors. In the Hospital for Radiotherapy of the MÃ¼nster University neutron therapy has been applied since 1986 for these indications using a DT neutron generator (14 MeV). Based on the results obtained in the treatment of 8 patients and a review of the literature, indications for, treatment planning and implementing of neutron therapy is illustrated. Particular consideration is given to CT and MRT. Neutron therapy offers an alternative to previously existing treatment methods for locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas or highly differentiated malignomas of the salivary glands. Its effectiveness should be verified by studies involving larger numbers of patients and longer observation periods.","title":"[Neutron therapy for adenoid cystic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"1966334"}
