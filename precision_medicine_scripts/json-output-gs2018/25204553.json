The approval was based in part on a randomized multicenter trial in the indicated population that allocated 417 patients to neoadjuvant treatment with trastuzumab-docetaxel (TD), pertuzumab-trastuzumab-docetaxel (PTD), pertuzumab-trastuzumab, or pertuzumab-docetaxel. PTD was administered preoperatively every 3 weeks for four cycles. Following surgery patients received three cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks and trastuzumab every 3 weeks to complete 1 year of therapy. The pathologic complete response rates by the FDA-preferred definition [absence of invasive cancer in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/is ypN0)] were 39.3% and 21.5% in the PTD and the TD arms, respectively (P \u003d 0.0063). The most common adverse reactions with PTD were alopecia, diarrhea, nausea, and neutropenia. This approval was based on the totality of evidence, particularly improved survival in the metastatic breast cancer trial, and a fully accrued confirmatory trial.","title":"First FDA approval of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer: pertuzumab for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.","pubmedId":"25204553"}
