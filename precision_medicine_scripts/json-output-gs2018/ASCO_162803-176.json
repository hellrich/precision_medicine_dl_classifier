The FIRE-3 study demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with anti-EGFR over bevacizumab in pts with KRAS exon 2 wild-type mCRC, while the CALGB 80405 study did not. This study is designed to compare panitumumab with bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 in pts with RAS wild-type chemotherapy-naive mCRC. Methods: Eligible pts are aged 20-79 years and ECOG performance status 0-1 with histologically/cytologically confirmed RAS wild-type mCRC. A total of 800 pts will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab or bevacizumab and stratified by institution, age (20-64 vs. 65-79 years), and liver metastases (present vs. absent). Treatment regimens include oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, concurrent with l-leucovorin 200 mg/m2, followed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) iv bolus 400 mg/m2 at day 1, followed by 46-hour 5-FU infusion 2400 mg/m2 and either panitumumab 6 mg/kg or bevacizumab 5 mg/kg at day 1 every two weeks. The primary endpoint is OS; the study was designed to detect the OS hazard ratio of 0.76, with a one-sided type I error of 0.025 and 80% power. An interim analysis is planned for the OS when approximately 70% of the targeted 570 events have occurred. A large-scale exploratory biomarker substudy to identify potential biomarker candidates using tumor tissue and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is also underway (Study ID: NCT02394834). Tumor tissue samples will be collected before chemotherapy. Plasma samples will be obtained before and after chemotherapy. Paired pretreatment DNA from primary tissue and ctDNA will be analyzed using an NGS-based platform to evaluate potential biomarkers for each treatment arm. Pretreatment and post-treatment ctDNA will also be analyzed to investigate resistance mechanisms for each treatment. As of January 2016, 98 pts have been randomized. Results are expected in 2020.
