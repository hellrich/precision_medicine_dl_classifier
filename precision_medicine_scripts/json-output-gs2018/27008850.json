Epidermal growth factor receptor-positive (2+/3+) patients more frequently had intestinal type than epidermal growth factor receptor-negative (0/1+) patients (82.5 vs. 44.1%, P \u003c 0.001). After adjusting for sex, age, stage and adjuvant chemotherapy, epidermal growth factor receptor-positive patients had a favorable overall survival outcome compared with epidermal growth factor receptor-negative patients (hazard ratio, 0.734; 95% confidence interval, 0.541-0.997; P \u003d 0.047), especially in Stage III disease (hazard ratio, 0.676; 95% confidence interval, 0.472-0.968; P \u003d 0.033). Among the 393 cases available for Â in situ hybridization, the correlation between immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization was statistically significant (P \u003d 0.001). Thirteen patients with gene amplification (3.3%) did not show different survival outcome with others (P \u003d 0.359).\nEpidermal growth factor receptor positivity was an independent favorable prognostic factor for gastric cancer, especially in Stage III disease.","title":"Prognostic significance and frequency of EGFR expression and amplification in surgically resected advanced gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"27008850"}
