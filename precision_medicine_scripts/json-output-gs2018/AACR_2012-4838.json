We have previously shown that the stem cell transcription factor FOXD3 is upregulated in mutant B-RAF melanoma cells upon RAF/MEK-inhibition, but the consequences of FOXD3 upregulation are unclear. Using microarrays and ChIP-sequencing, we identified ERBB3/HER3 as a direct target of FOXD3. FOXD3 enhanced ERBB3 expression and responsiveness to its ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). Interestingly, PLX4032 or AZD6244-treated cells displayed enhanced NRG1-dependent ERBB3 phosphorylation and downstream AKT activation. These effects were associated with NRG1 enhanced migration and growth of RAF/MEK-inhibitor treated cells in vitro. Phosphorylation of ERBB3 was found to be dependent on ERBB2/HER2, as NRG1/ERBB3-signaling was inhibited by ERBB2-targeting siRNA, the ERBB2-blocking antibody trastuzumab and the ERBB2-inhibitor lapatinib. Additionally, the combination of lapatinib and PLX4032 was more effective than either alone at inhibiting colony formation in the presence or absence of NRG1. Similarly, we found that combining lapatinib with PLX4720 was more effective than either drug alone at reducing tumor burden in melanoma xenografts. These results suggest that upregulation of ERBB3 by FOXD3 serves as an adaptive response to protect melanoma cells from the effects of RAF/MEK-inhibitors and promotes resistance. In summary, targeting the NRG1/ERBB3 pathway in conjunction with RAF/MEK may provide a clinical benefit.","title":"Upregulation of ERBB3/HER3 by FOXD3, an adaptive response promoting resistance to RAF/MEK-inhibitors","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-4838"}
