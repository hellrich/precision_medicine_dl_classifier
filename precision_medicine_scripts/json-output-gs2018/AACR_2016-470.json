Personalized medicine strives to individualize and improve patient care. To individualize treatment decisions in advanced melanoma we analyzed 364 samples from 214 patients. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, and we developed patient derived xenografts (PDX). WES and targeted sequencing of ctDNA allowed us to predict responses to therapy and to identify and monitor mechanisms of resistance. WES of tumors revealed new therapeutic strategies in BRAF V600 wild-type and BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma and we validated these in patient derived xenografts (PDX). Thus, we describe a powerful combination of techniques for personalized medicine to improve the management of melanoma patients.","title":"Application of sequencing, liquid biopsies and patient derived xenografts for personalized medicine in melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-470"}
