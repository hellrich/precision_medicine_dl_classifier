Clinical features included intrauterine growth retardation, psychomotor delay, antimongoloid slanting of the palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, low set ears, cleft palate, micrognathia, luxatio coxae and pes varus. It is suggested that the gene for soluble isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) is located on 2q33.3. The activity of serum IDH1 was in the normal range in this patient.","title":"Interstitial deletion of long arm of chromosome 2(q31q33).","pubmedId":"2284935"}
