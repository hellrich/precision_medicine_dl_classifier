Thirty-five of the 40 cases showed 1+ or stronger labelling for CD-117 (up to a maximum of 4+). Three patients with neoplasms showing 4+ staining were selected for imatinib therapy. None responded. c-kit (CD-117) expression in melanoma appears to be common; however, the value of imatinib therapy remains to be proven.","title":"An immunohistochemical evaluation of c-kit (CD-117) expression in malignant melanoma, and results of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) therapy in three patients.","pubmedId":"16034306"}
