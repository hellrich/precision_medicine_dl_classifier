Cytogenetic studies show an abnormal karyotype in 50-60% of the T-cell ALL patients; ABL1 fusions are present in approximately 8% of the cases. Dasatinib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, directly targets the BCR-ABL gene. We describe a pediatric case of T-cell ALL with amplification of the ABL1 gene in which remission was achieved only after the addition of dasatinib to conventional chemotherapy.","title":"Complete morphologic and molecular remission after introduction of dasatinib in the treatment of a pediatric patient with t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and ABL1 amplification.","pubmedId":"22689211"}
