The capillary filtration coefficient (CFC) increased in response to stimulation of sympathetic efferents irrespective of the mode of vascular bed perfusion. The mechanisms of the above changes of the capillary hydrostatic pressure are considered from the standpoint of participation of hemodynamic factors and active shifts of pre-and postcapillary pressure. Possible role of the change of the vascular bed permeability and activation of beta-adrenoreceptors in the mechanism of the capillary filtration coefficient increase, is discussed.","title":"[Neurogenic changes in filtration-absorptive ratios in skeletal muscle vessels].","pubmedId":"4065362"}
