There is a paucity of information on how many cancer patients (pts) meet eligibility for basket trials. This study assessed the genetic eligibility of cancer pts seen at a large cancer center for the currently open basket trials.  Methods:  Moffitts Clinical Genomic Action Committee (CGAC) database was used to assess 236 pts across 30 cancer types with targeted deep sequencing as part of clinical care between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2014. Pts were screened for basic histologic and genetic eligibility on all basket trials open in North America in January, 2015 (Novartis Signature, NCI-MATCH, NCI-M-PACT). The trials included 23 different arms utilizing different agents based on 44 different molecular alterations; 11 of these alterations allowed eligibility into multiple trials.  Results:  Among the 236 evaluable pts, 83.5% met genetic eligibility for at least 1 of the arms examined with an average of 2.89 eligible arms per patient and a range of 0 to 15. The percentage of histologically eligible pts meeting genetic eligibility ranged from 0% (non-melanoma or colorectal BRAF V600 mutated solid or hematologic malignancy) to 50.0% (PARP1/2 or TP53 mutated solid tumor) across all treatment arms. Of 188 pts with solid malignancies, 93.6% met genetic eligibility for at least 1 of the trials vs. 45.8% of 48 pts with hematologic malignancies.  Conclusions:  The vast majority of pts within a clinical genetic database who received somatic tumor sequencing met genetic eligibility for at least one aberration-specific clinical trial; however 16.5% of pts overall and the majority of those with hematologic malignancies remained without basket trial options. These results highlight opportunities for enrollment in clinical trials given access to both tumor sequencing and next-generation clinical trials.
