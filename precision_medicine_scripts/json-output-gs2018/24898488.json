Case 1 was a 67-year-old man who presented with heartburn that developed a month after dabigatran administration. Case 2 was an 81-year-old woman who presented with epigastralgia that developed within a few days of dabigatran administration. Endoscopic findings were similar in both cases, including shallow esophageal ulcers covered with a thin whitish membrane. The patients were advised to consume the drug with plenty of water during meals and to remain in a sitting position for 30 min after consumption. This method successfully decreased their symptoms and ulcers, indicating that drug administration guidance is extremely effective in managing dabigatran-induced esophageal injury.
