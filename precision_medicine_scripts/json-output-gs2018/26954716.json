We hypothesised that the functional role of c-MYC differs between molecular subtypes of BCs.\nWe therefore investigated the correlation between c-MYC protein expression and other proteins involved in different cellular functions together with clinicopathological parameters, patients\u0027 outcome and treatments in a large early-stage molecularly characterised series of primary invasive BCs (n\u003d1106) using immunohistochemistry. The METABRIC BC cohort (n\u003d1980) was evaluated for MYC mRNA expression and a systems biology approach utilised to identify genes associated with MYC in the different BC molecular subtypes.\nHigh MYC and c-MYC expression was significantly associated with poor prognostic factors, including grade and basal-like BCs. In luminal A tumours, c-MYC was associated with ATM (P\u003d0.005), Cyclin B1 (P\u003d0.002), PIK3CA (P\u003d0.009) and Ki67 (P\u003c0.001). In contrast, in basal-like tumours, c-MYC showed positive association with Cyclin E (P\u003d0.003) and p16 (P\u003d0.042) expression only. c-MYC was an independent predictor of a shorter distant metastases-free survival in luminal A LN+ tumours treated with endocrine therapy (ET; P\u003d0.013). In luminal tumours treated with ET, MYC mRNA expression was associated with BC-specific survival (P\u003d0.001). In ER-positive tumours, MYC was associated with expression of translational genes while in ER-negative tumours it was associated with upregulation of glucose metabolism genes.\nc-MYC function is associated with specific molecular subtypes of BCs and its overexpression confers resistance to ET. The diverse mechanisms of c-MYC function in the different molecular classes of BCs warrants further investigation particularly as potential therapeutic targets.","title":"MYC functions are specific in biological subtypes of breast cancer and confers resistance to endocrine therapy in luminal tumours.","pubmedId":"26954716"}
