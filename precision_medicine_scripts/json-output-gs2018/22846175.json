Since that time, PTEN has emerged as one of the most frequently mutated or deleted genes in human cancers, including human skin cancers. In particular, loss of PTEN function through mutation or deletion has been observed in up to 70% of melanoma cell lines, and epigenetic silencing of PTEN has been observed in 30-40% of malignant melanomas (Mehnert and Kluger, 2012).","title":"SUMO, PTEN and Tumor Suppression.","pubmedId":"22846175"}
