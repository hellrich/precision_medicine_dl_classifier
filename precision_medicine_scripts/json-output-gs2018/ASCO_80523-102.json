The aim of our study was to analyze brain metastases from colorectal tumor, and identify cancer characteristics which were associated with their development. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 19 patients (11 males and 8 females, 50-88 years, mean 67 years) who underwent brain surgery. DNA was extracted from FFPE sections following macrodissection using an automated iPrep system (InVitrogen). RNA was extracted from serial sections using the RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using the Quantitect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). KRAS and BRAF mutations were tested using allele-specific PCR. PTEN expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Amphiregulin expression was measured by real-time PCR. Results: KRAS mutations were found in 13 (68.4%) brain metastases : c.35G\u003eT, c.35G\u003eA, c.35G\u003eC and c.38G\u003eA mutations were found in 5, 3, 3 and 2 samples, respectively. One tumor (5.3%, KRAS wt) presented the BRAF p.V600E mutation. PTEN was detected by immunohistochemistry in 12 tumors (63.2%), but 7 cases (36.8%) were negative for PTEN expression. Of these 7 tumors, 5 presented a KRAS mutation, and 1 was BRAF V600E. Amphiregulin expression was found to be very low in 10 tumors, intermediate in 6 samples, and high in the remaining 3 tumors. Two of these 3 tumors presented a mutated KRAS and the third one was PTEN negative. KRAS, BRAF and PTEN status were fully concordant between primary cancer and brain metastasis from the same individual. However, we did not find any correlation in the expression level of amphiregulin between the primary tumor and the metastatic site. Conclusions: KRAS mutation prevalence was high in this series of patients presenting with cerebral metastases. Loss of PTEN was strongly associated with KRAS/BRAF alterations. Altogether, the overwhelming majority of the tumors tested (16/19, 84.2%) presented at least one molecular alteration. Further characterization of these tumors might yield better insight into their development, and potentially the treatment of these patients with poor prognosis.","title":"Molecular alterations in brain metastases from colorectal tumors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_80523-102"}
