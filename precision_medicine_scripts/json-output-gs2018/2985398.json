The anti-glioma Mabs BF7 and GE2 reacted preferentially with gliomas, while the anti-glioma Mab CG12 reacted with gliomas, melanomas, neuroblastomas and medulloblastomas. The five anti-melanoma Mabs reacted with gliomas, neuroblastomas and medulloblastomas. The anti-HLA-DR Mab D1-12 reacted with gliomas, melanomas and some meningiomas. On the basis of the data presented, we describe three different antigenic systems; the first one is glioma-associated, the second one is related to differentiation antigens expressed on cells derived from the neuroectoderm and the third is represented by HLA-DR antigens which are expressed not only on B-lymphoblastoid cells but also on melanomas and gliomas.","title":"Phenotyping of 60 cultured human gliomas and 34 other neuroectodermal tumors by means of monoclonal antibodies against glioma, melanoma and HLA-DR antigens.","pubmedId":"2985398"}
