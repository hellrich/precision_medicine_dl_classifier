Flow cytometric analyses combined with immunoblotting and ligand binding experiments revealed that alpha 2MR was expressed on malignant cells from patients with acute and chronic myelomonocytic leukemias, while no significant expression was found on malignant cells from acute and chronic lymphatic leukemia, lymphomas, plasma cell leukemias or hairy cell leukemia. In acute myeloid leukemia, alpha 2MR was expressed in 50% of the M4-M5 cases, but only in three of thirty of the morphologically undifferentiated or non-monocytic cases (M1-M3 and M6). In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia five of seven cases were alpha 2MR-positive, while only one of seven cases of chronic myeloid leukemia was positive. The monocytic nature of the hematopoietic cells reacting with A2MR alpha 2 was further confirmed by a close correlation with CD14 surface expression.","title":"Surface expression of the alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor on human malignant blood cells.","pubmedId":"1560672"}
