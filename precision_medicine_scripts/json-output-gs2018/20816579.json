Hereditary melanoma is also included, though it differs from the others in several respects. The underlying genetic aberrations causing these syndromes are largely known, allowing novel treatments to be developed for some of these disorders. Early recognition and diagnosis allows for close follow-up and surveillance for associated malignancies.","title":"Hereditary genodermatoses with cancer predisposition.","pubmedId":"20816579"}
