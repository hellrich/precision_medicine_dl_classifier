This article presents representative case histories that illustrate the usefulness of careful follow-up of persons who have dysplastic melanocytic nevi or cutaneous melanoma, as well as examination of their blood relatives for the same lesions. Identification and periodic examination of such high-risk persons may result in the detection of melanoma in a curable phase. Our observations suggest that (1) dysplastic melanocytic nevi may aggregate in families of persons who have dysplastic melanocytic nevi or melanoma, even in the absence of a family history of dysplastic melanocytic nevi or melanoma and (2) formal genetic and natural history studies of persons who have dysplastic melanocytic nevi outside the familial melanoma setting are warranted.","title":"Dysplastic melanocytic nevi and cutaneous melanoma: markers of increased melanoma risk for affected persons and blood relatives.","pubmedId":"2298967"}
