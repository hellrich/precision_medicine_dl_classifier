We used breast cancer cells, prostate cancer cells and melanoma cells spiked into normal donor whole blood and captured with high porosity micro-filters followed by immunofluorescence staining. DAPI, CD45 conjugated with QDot525, CK8/18/19 conjugated with QDot605 and high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA) conjugated with QDot705 were stained to identify CTCs. ER conjugated with QDot800 and PSA conjugated with QDot655 were stained to characterize CTCs. The CTC recovery rate was compared with the report from the US Food and Drug Administration- approved CellSearch system (Veridex). Multiplexed tumor marker staining results were compared with single staining with fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody. Our study demonstrates that CTC multiplexed analysis has the potential for further genetic characterization of CTCs and offers potential insights into therapeutic targeting and resistance mechanisms.","title":"Identification and characterization of circulating tumor cells with multiplexed Quantum Dot conjugated antibodies","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-382"}
