Following a systematic literature search, relative risks were extracted from 60 studies published before September 2002. Fixed and random effects models were used to obtain pooled estimates for family history (RR \u003d 1.74, 1.41-2.14), skin type (I vs. IV: RR \u003d 2.09, 1.67-2.58), high density of freckles (RR \u003d 2.10, 1.80-2.45), skin colour (Fair vs. Dark: RR \u003d 2.06, 1.68-2.52), eye colour (Blue vs. Dark: RR \u003d 1.47, 1.28-1.69) and hair colour (Red vs. Dark: RR \u003d 3.64, 2.56-5.37), pre-malignant and skin cancer lesions (RR \u003d 4.28, 2.80-6.55) and actinic damage indicators (RR \u003d 2.02, 1.24-3.29). Sub-group analysis and meta-regression were carried out to explore sources of between-study variation and bias. Sensitivity analyses investigated reliability of results and publication bias. Latitude and adjustment for phenotype were two study characteristics that significantly influenced the estimates.","title":"Meta-analysis of risk factors for cutaneous melanoma: III.
