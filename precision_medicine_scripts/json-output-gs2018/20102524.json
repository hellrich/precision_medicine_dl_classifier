The patient was a 52-year-old woman who underwent subtotal removal for a left frontotemporal tumor. The palisading pattern was present throughout the tumor. Several glial markers were revealed by immunohistochemical examination, but no neuronal markers were observed. Genetic studies showed O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation, wild type IDH1, and the absence of 1p/19q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor genes. Based on histological and genetic features, this tumor might not be suited to any of neuroepithelial tumor in the recent WHO classification. We consider that cases such as this should be temporarily set under a separate heading and be entrusted to future investigation after more cases have been accumulated.
