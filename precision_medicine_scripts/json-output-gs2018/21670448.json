The prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations was evaluated in the context of other clinical prognostic markers and genetic risk factors (cytogenetic risk group; mutations in NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, IDH1, IDH2, MLL1, NRAS, WT1, and WT1 SNPrs16754; expression levels of BAALC, ERG, EVI1, MLL5, MN1, and WT1).\nDNMT3A mutations were found in 87 (17.8%) of 489 patients with AML who were younger than 60 years of age. Patients with DNMT3A mutations were older, had higher WBC and platelet counts, more often had a normal karyotype and mutations in NPM1, FLT3, and IDH1 genes, and had higher MLL5 expression levels as compared with patients with wild-type DNMT3A. Mutations in DNMT3A independently predicted a shorter overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.21; P \u003d .005) by multivariate analysis, but were not associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) or complete remission (CR) rate when the entire patient cohort was considered. In cytogenetically normal (CN) AML, 27.2% harbored DNMT3A mutations that independently predicted shorter OS (HR \u003d 2.46; 95% CI, 1.58 to 3.83; P \u003c .001) and lower CR rate (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.84; P \u003d .015), but not RFS (P \u003d .32). Within patients with CN-AML, DNMT3A mutations had an unfavorable effect on OS, RFS, and CR rate in NPM1/FLT3-ITD high-risk but not in low-risk patients.\nDNMT3A mutations are frequent in younger patients with AML and are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.","title":"Incidence and prognostic influence of DNMT3A mutations in acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"21670448"}
