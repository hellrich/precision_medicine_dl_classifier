Donor germ cells colonize the recipient\u0027s testis and produce donor-derived sperm, such that the recipient male can distribute the genetic material of the germ cell donor. Germ cell transplantation represents a functional reconstitution assay for male germ line stem cells and as such has vastly increased our ability to study the biology of stem cells in the testis and define phenotypes of infertility. First developed in rodents, the technique has now been used in a number of animal species, including domestic mammals, chicken and fish. There are three major applications for this technology in animals: first, to study fundamental aspects of male germ line stem cell biology and male fertility; second, to preserve the reproductive potential of genetically valuable individuals by male germ cell transplantation within or between species; third, to produce transgenic sperm by genetic manipulation of isolated germ line stem cells and subsequent transplantation. Transgenesis through the male germ line has tremendous potential in species in which embryonic stem cells are not available and somatic cell nuclear transfer has limited success. Therefore, transplantation of male germ cells is a uniquely valuable approach for the study, preservation and manipulation of male fertility in animals.","title":"Male germ cell transplantation.","pubmedId":"18638137"}
