There were 285 men and 225 women, with a mean age of 63 years (range, 31 to 90 years). The Cox proportional model was used to examine the effect on survival. Tumor size was incorporated into the model as a linear effect and as categorical variables. The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator was used to graphically display the relationship between the tumor size and survival.\nThe Cox proportional hazards model did not show a statistically significant relationship between tumor size and survival (p \u003d 0.701) as a linear effect. Tumor size was then categorized into quartiles, and again there was no statistically significant difference in survival between groups (p \u003d 0.597). Tumor size was also categorized into deciles, and there was no statistical relationship between tumor size and survival (p \u003d 0.674).\nThis study confirms stratifying patients with stage IA non-small cell lung cancer in the same TNM classification, given no apparent difference in survival. Unfortunately, these data caution that improved small nodule detection with screening CT may not significantly improve lung cancer mortality. The appropriate prospective randomized trial appears warranted.","title":"Correlation of tumor size and survival in patients with stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"10858384"}
