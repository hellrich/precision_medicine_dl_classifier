The FDA Web site, the National Clinical Trials registry, and abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) were also evaluated to identify unpublished data and future clinical trials.\nAll identified clinical and preclinical studies published in the English language were assessed, including selected references from the bibliographies of articles.\nActivation of the Hh signaling pathway is well documented in BCC. Vismodegib is a small-molecule inhibitor of Hh signaling that acts by antagonizing the protein Smoothened (SMO), thereby preventing downstream transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. Vismodegib was approved by the FDA in January 2012 for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced BCC (laBCC), or metastatic BCC (mBCC) for which surgery or radiation cannot be utilized. A pivotal phase 2 trial evaluating 104 patients demonstrated that treatment with vismodegib, 150 mg orally once daily, resulted in a 30% and 43% objective response rate in patients with mBCC and laBCC, respectively. The most common adverse effects from vismodegib were mild to moderate and included muscle spasms, dysgeusia, decreased weight, fatigue, alopecia, and diarrhea. However, clinical studies noted a high incidence of discontinuation of therapy by patients for reasons other than disease progression.\nThe approval of vismodegib represents the only targeted, prospectively studied treatment option for patients with advanced BCC. Further research assessing the utility of vismodegib in the treatment of other malignancies and the development of resistance patterns will more clearly define the role of Hedgehog inhibition in the broader scheme of oncological disorders.","title":"Vismodegib: an inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24259609"}
