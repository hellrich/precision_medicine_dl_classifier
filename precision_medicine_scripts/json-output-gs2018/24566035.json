The first molecular subgroup is defined by activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and a dramatic response to specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Since then, multiple genetic alterations (KRAS, HER2, BRAF, PIK3CA, ALK, ROS, RET…) have been identified as potential target of novel therapies, and molecular profiling has become common practice. This review focus on the molecular alterations associated with non-small cell lung cancer, including molecular profiling and response to targeted therapies.
