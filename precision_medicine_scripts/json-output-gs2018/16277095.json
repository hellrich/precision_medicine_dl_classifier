In level II, grade 2 stomatitis and grade 1 sensory symptoms occurred in 1 patient, and grade 1 edema in 1 case. In level Ill, grade 2 edema was noted in 2 patients, damage to nails in 1 patient, asthenia in 1 patient, grade 1 neuropathy in 2 patients, and grade 1 nausea in 1 patient. In level IV, grade 2 edema was present in 1 patient, grade 3 edema in 1 patient, changes with fall of nails and grade 2 erythema of face in 2 patients, asthenia in 2 patients, grade 1 neuropathy in both patients. Nine patients had a more than a 50% decrease in PSA after 2 cycles of therapy.\nThe results of the study suggest a good tolerability of weekly 35 Mg/m2 docetaxel in hormone-refractory prostate cancer in association with estramustine.","title":"Dose-finding study of weekly docetaxel plus estramustine in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"16277095"}
