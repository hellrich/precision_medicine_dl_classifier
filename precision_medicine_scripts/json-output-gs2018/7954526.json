All patients were typed for HLA-A1 and -A2, either serologically or by a newly developed RT-PCR method. Two of these patients expressed HLA-A2, one the HLA-A1 haplotype and one further patient was heterozygous HLA-A1/-A2. The prognostic parameters for all four patients indicated that rapid progression of the disease was to be expected. However, only two of the patients showed rapid progression, while the remaining two patients are still alive after more than 3 years. In TIL in primary melanomas, a possible correlation was suggested between HLA-A2 and the preferential usage of the TCR V gene families V alpha 4, V alpha 5, V alpha 22 and V beta 8, whereas the V beta 3 gene family appeared to be expressed together with HLA-A1. Other highly expressed V gene families, apparently not restricted to either HLA-A1 or -A2, were V alpha 1 (expressed in three of four primary tumours) and V alpha 21 (expressed in two of four tumours). We found no evidence suggesting any correlations between the haplotypes HLA-A1 and -A2 and preferential V gene family expression in the metastatic lesions, and the only common feature was V alpha 8, which was found to be highly expressed in two out of three subcutaneous metastases. The V gene families, which were highly expressed in the primary tumour were generally not, or only very weakly, expressed in metastases and vice versa, possibly reflecting a change in the phenotype of the metastatic melanoma target cells. With regards to patient 0368, it was possible to obtain and study material from two subcutaneous metastases. The first metastasis was excised more than a year after the primary tumour, showing a completely different V region repertoire. The second metastasis was excised at surgery 2 years after primary surgery and likewise showed a dramatic shift in comparison to the first subcutaneous metastasis. Although the present study only included a small number of patients, it suggests that the estimation of V gene expression, if applied to a larger amount of patient material, might make it possible to substantiate further the suggested correlations between the T cell response against the tumour, HLA and antigen expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","title":"Analysis of T cell receptor alpha beta variability in lymphocytes infiltrating melanoma primary tumours and metastatic lesions.","pubmedId":"7954526"}
