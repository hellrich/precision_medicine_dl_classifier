Immunohistochemical staining was performed in paraffin sections by using polyclonal antibody anti-p80 and other monoclonal antibodies. The clinical data of these patients were analyzed and all patients were followed-up.\nThe neoplastic cells in 9 out of 19 ALCL expressed p80 protein. Histopathologically, all 9 cases with p80 expression were common type and small cell type. None of these 9 cases were Hodgkin like type (P \u003c 0.05). Immunologically, all the 9 positive cases were T and null cell phenotype and none of them was B cell or other phenotype (P \u003c 0.05). Clinically, the patients with p80 expression were younger than those without p80 expression (P \u003c 0.05). The prognosis of the former was worse than in the later (P \u003c 0.05).\np80 positive ALCL could be a new clinicopathological entity. The polyclonal antibody anti-p80 might be an useful marker for the differential diagnosis and prognosis estimation of ALCL.","title":"[The expression and clinical significance of p80 protein in anaplastic large cell lymphoma].","pubmedId":"11866899"}
