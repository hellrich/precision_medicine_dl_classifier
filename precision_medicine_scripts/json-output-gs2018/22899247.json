It is an important therapeutic target and its product protein is a key biomarker for breast cancer. A 28-bp GGA repeat sequence (Pu28-mer) in the nuclease hypersensitive site of the ERBB2 promoter region may play an important role in the regulation of ERBB2 transcription, possibly involving the formation of a G-quadruplex. In order to investigate this possibility, an affinity MALDI-MS approach was used for in vitro protein capture from nuclear extracts from cultured MCF-7 and BT-474 cancer cells at Pu28-mer and control oligonucleotide-modified surfaces. Captured proteins from MCF-7 cells were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Based on these results, Western blot was then used to interrogate captured proteins from both MCF-7 and the Her-2/neu-positive BT-474 cells. Results support the formation of a G-quadruplex by Pu28-mer, indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, that selectively captures transcription factors including Ku70, Ku80, PURA, nucleolin, and hnRNP K. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed binding of Ku70, Ku80, PURA, and nucleolin to ERBB2 promoter in the live BT-474 cells. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the role of non-duplex DNA structures in gene regulation and provide a more complete picture of the regulation of ErbB2 expression in breast cancer. The results also provide a blueprint for development of \"genome-inspired\" aptamers based on the Pu28-mer sequence for in vitro and in vivo detection of proteins related to regulation of ERBB2 gene expression and breast cancer.","title":"Capture and identification of proteins that bind to a GGA-rich sequence from the ERBB2 gene promoter region.","pubmedId":"22899247"}
