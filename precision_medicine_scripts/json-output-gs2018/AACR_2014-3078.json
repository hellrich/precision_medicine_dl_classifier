{"genes":["EpCAM"],"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["2014 AACR Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"The CTC-enrichment based on the size of the cells, is addressing the problem of reduced EpCAM expression, but filtration shows relatively low sensitivity and specificity, because small CTCs may escape of the detection, whereas big leukocytes may contaminate population of CTCs Isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells is based on use of filters, which preferentially capture tumor cells bigger than 8 uM.Our filtration device (MetaCell, Metacell s.r.o., Ostrava, Czech Republic) isolates tumor cells by size from a blood sample up to 6 ml. Moreover immunocytochemistry and FISH assays can be performed on the filter. The protocol enables to isolate viable cells, allowing further in vitro experiments. Furthermore, tumor cells can be isolated without using an antibody-based approach, suggesting that the device can be used for the isolation of a large spectrum of tumor cells, including cell of non-epithelial origin.We presented the successful isolation and cultivation of CTC/DTC of the following cancer: NSCLC, mesothelioma, oesophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, leiomyosarcoma, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma and renal cancer.","title":"Isolation and in vitro culturing of human circulating tumor cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3078"}
