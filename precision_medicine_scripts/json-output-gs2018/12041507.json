Plasma from mice bearing B16 melanoma for 30 days (plasma d30) showed a more profound immunosuppressive effect on the in vitro proliferation of unrelated antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the presence of both antigen and antigen-presenting cells (APC) than plasma from naïve mice. The level of plasma transforming growth factor (TGF)- was elevated in mice bearing B16 melanoma for 30 days compared with naïve mice, and the suppressive effect of plasma d30 was partially diminished by the neutralization of TGF-. Interestingly, immunoglobulin (IgG)-bound TGF-, but not IgG-unbound TGF-, in plasma d30 was suggested to be responsible for the immunosuppressive activity. In addition, no suppressive effect of plasma d30 was observed when antigen was added as a class II peptide, thus suggesting that the impaired proliferation of CD4+ T cells in the presence of plasma d30 was due to a dysfunction of antigen uptake/processing by APC. Furthermore, dissociation between IgG and TGF- resulted in a loss of the suppressive activity of plasma d30. Taken together, these results suggest that circulating IgG-bound TGF- is, at least in part, responsible for the impaired responses of CD4+ T cells at the late tumour-bearing stage by suppressing antigen uptake/ processing by APC.","title":"Circulating immunoglobulin-bound transforming growth factor beta at a late tumour-bearing stage impairs antigen-specific responses of CD4+ T cells.","pubmedId":"12041507"}
