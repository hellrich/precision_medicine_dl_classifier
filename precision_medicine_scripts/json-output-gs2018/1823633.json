Histologically, 53 melanomas (22.7%) were associated with naevus cells. Such a high degree of association suggests that melanocytic naevus may be a precursor of a large number of melanomas. Analysing the cases according to Clark\u0027s levels and Breslow\u0027s index, a decrease in the naevus-melanoma association was seen with tumour progression, suggesting that advanced tumours may overgrow pre-existing nevus cells, appearing as de novo melanomas. The comparison between histological and clinical data suggest some interpretations of the natural history of melanoma.","title":"Spatial association of melanocytic naevus and melanoma.","pubmedId":"1823633"}
