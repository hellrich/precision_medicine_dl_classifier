In addition, eight previously reported polymorphisms in the PTCH gene were also found in 10 cases.\nThe present study indicated that both sporadic and NBCCS-related OKCs could carry PTCH gene mutation. Thus, mutational inactivation of PTCH gene may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of OKC.","title":"[Detection of PTCH gene mutations in odontogenic keratocysts by SSCP and DNA sequencing].","pubmedId":"16999341"}
