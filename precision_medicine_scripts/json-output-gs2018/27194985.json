It has been shown that 50% of melanomas harbor activating BRAF mutations, with over 90% being the V600E mutation.\nThe goal of this research was to determine the prevalence of the BRAF V600E mutation in patients from Central Mexico diagnosed with primary melanoma.\nSkin biopsies from 47 patients with melanoma were obtained from the dermatology department of the Hospital General \u0027Dr. Manuel Gea González\u0027 in Mexico City. For BRAF mutation determination, after DNA isolation, the gene region where the mutation occurs was amplified by PCR. Subsequently, the presence or absence of the V600E mutation was detected by Sanger sequencing performed at the private molecular diagnostic laboratory Vitagénesis in Monterrey, Mexico.\nOf the 47 patients sampled, 6.4% harbored the V600E mutation. No statistical significance was found between mutations and the type of tumor.","title":"BRAF Mutation (V600E) Prevalence in Mexican Patients Diagnosed with Melanoma.","pubmedId":"27194985"}
