We conducted a pharmacodynamic study to evaluate potential biomarkers  associated with clinical response and disease control.  Methods:  25  patients had tumor specimen available at baseline and tested for c-KIT mutation, amplification and c-KIT expression. Twelve had available follow-up biopsies, 5 with a progressive disease (PD), 8 with a stable disease (SD), 1 with a partial response (PR). Follow-up biopsies were tested for c-KIT secondary mutations, gene copy number variation and expression related to angiogenesis, apoptosis and proliferation. IHC staining was performed on sections at baseline and after treatment for c-KIT, p-ERK, p-AKT and p-MEK.  Results:  C-KIT expression was confirmed in all patients treated with nilotinib at baseline. The presence of a c-KIT exon 11 or 13 mutations was associated with clinical response. No secondary c-KIT mutations were detected at progression. c-KIT gene copy number revealed an amplification in 5 out of 25 patients prior to treatment without association with response rate. However, 1 SD patient had a decrease in c-KIT amplification after treatment. VEGFR-2 gene copy number whose co-amplification with c-KIT is frequent in other solid cancers was not associated with clinical outcome. pMek and pErk decreased in some SD and PR patients, with no variation of pAKT. Interestingly, using transcriptomic analyses FGF2 overexpression prior to treatment was observed in all PR and SD patients studied.  Conclusions:  Clinical response is associated with c-KIT exon 11 or 13 mutations, and not with the sole amplification of c-KIT. In this study, we found no mutation associated with primary resistance. Albeit no evident biomarker signature was identified in this pharmacodynamics analysis, further studies are needed to evaluate the predictive value of FGF2 expression for nilotinib response.
