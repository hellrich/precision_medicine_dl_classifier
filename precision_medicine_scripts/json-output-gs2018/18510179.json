The purpose of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of serum anti-p53 antibodies (p53 Abs), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 15-3, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 in taxane-based and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Sixty-eight patients with locally advanced breast carcinoma were included. Thirty-two were treated with taxane (the taxane group) and 36 with anthracycline (the anthracycline group). The standard dosage of docetaxel was 100 mg/m2 (day 1) and those of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and 5-flurouracil were 500 mg/m2 (day 1-8), 40 mg/m2 (day 1) and 500 mg/m2 (day 1-8), respectively. The p53 Abs were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CEA and CA15-3 were detected by Elecsys 2010 Disc System; ER, PR and HER-2 were detected by immunohistochemistry staining. The biomarkers p53 Abs, CEA and CA15-3 were detected in serum samples, and the immunohistochemistry staining for ER, PR and HER-2 was performed in tumor samples before and after NAC. The expression of p53 Abs was significantly reduced by taxane (P \u003d 0.006). The serum CEA and CA15-3 levels were significantly affected by both taxane (P \u003d 0.004 and P \u003d 0.008) and anthracycline (P \u003d 0.002 and P \u003d 0.000) drugs. HER-2-negative status (pre-neoadjuvant) was correlated with a high objective response rate (OR) in both taxane-based and anthracycline-based chemotherapy (P \u003d 0.022 and P \u003d 0.025), whereas p53 Ab-negative status (pre-neoadjuvant) was correlated with high OR rate in anthracycline-based chemotherapy (P \u003d 0.039). This study shows that the serum p53 Ab level is easily changed by taxane. CEA and CA15-3 levels are easily changed by taxane and anthracycline. The p53 Ab-negative patients may predict a high clinical OR rate in anthracycline-based NAC. HER-2-negative may predict a high OR in both taxane-based and anthracycline-based NAC.","title":"Predictive value of serum anti-p53 antibodies, carcino-embryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 15-3, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 in taxane-based and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"18510179"}
