The majority of skull metastases of thyroid carcinoma are of the follicular subtype, rather than thyroid papillary carcinoma. In this report, a 55-year-old woman with skull metastasis from thyroid papillary carcinoma is presented. The metastatic lesion of the skull was hypervascular and osteolytic, and the bleeding was profuse during resection. There have been only four reports of skull metastasis from thyroid papillary carcinoma. The mean period from the initial diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma until the detection of skull metastasis is 23.3 years, whereas in this patient, it was about 2 years. Therefore, in the clinical course of thyroid papillary carcinoma, skull metastasis should be considered, and the patient should be meticulously followed up.","title":"Skull metastasis of thyroid papillary carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17386370"}
