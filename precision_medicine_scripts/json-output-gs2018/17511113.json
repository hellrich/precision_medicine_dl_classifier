Most cases submitted were anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)+ ALCL highlighting unusual clinical settings, histologic variants, and variant translocation partners. Cases submitted as ALK- ALCL emphasized the immunohistochemical overlap with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (eg, CD15+/CD30+). It was also clear that consensus histologic and immunohistochemical criteria for the diagnosis of ALK-ALCL are lacking. Many expressed the opinion that ALK-ALCL is not a distinct entity at the immunophenotypic or genetic level and is better designated as peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), unspecified. Others suggested that the histologic features of ALK-ALCL are distinctive nevertheless and that this diagnosis has meaning that is lost by designating these neoplasms as PTCL, unspecified. This session also included CD30+ anaplastic lymphomas involving skin in which the differential diagnosis included cutaneous ALCL and systemic ALK-ALCL.","title":"Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma.","pubmedId":"17511113"}
