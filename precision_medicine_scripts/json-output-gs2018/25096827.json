Current guidelines recommend systematic HPV-DNA and/or p16 testing on HNSCCs, although treatment approach should not be directed by test results. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess whether HPV-DNA and/or p16 status are systematically evaluated across North American otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons and (2) whether the status is used to direct treatment approach.\nA 15-question online survey was sent to three associations: the Association of Oto-rhino-laryngology-Head and Neck Surgery of Quebec, the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and the American Head and Neck Society.\nSixty-seven percent of respondents systematically test for HPV-DNA and/or p16 on HNSCC sites, while 58.3% report using test results to direct treatment for oropharyngeal cancers. A lack of official guidelines was the primary reason (81.8%) physicians did not use test results to direct treatment. Academic centre physicians (83.3%) and physicians with â©¾50% oncologic practice (87.6%) were more likely to test for HPV-DNA and/or p16 in HNSCC compared to non-academic centre physicians (39.7%) and physicians with \u003c50% oncologic practices (51.4%) (p\u003c0.001). Cost of the tests (69.2%), lack of relevance (46.1%) and time constraints (30.8%) were the primary reasons HPV-DNA and/or p16 were not tested.\nThe majority of North American respondents in this survey systematically test for HPV-DNA and/or p16 in HNSCC sites, and most indicate that test results influence their treatment approach for oropharyngeal cancers.","title":"North-American survey on HPV-DNA and p16 testing for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25096827"}
