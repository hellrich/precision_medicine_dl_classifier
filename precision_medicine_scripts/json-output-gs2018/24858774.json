We report two cases of primary mucosal melanoma, one in a 70-year-old male in the palate and the other in a 73-year-old female in the maxillary sinus. Early diagnosis and proper clinical and cytologic evaluation is necessary to institute therapeutic intervention. These cases are reported on account of their rarity of occurrence and difficulty of treatment.","title":"Primary mucosal melanoma: report of two cases.","pubmedId":"24858774"}
