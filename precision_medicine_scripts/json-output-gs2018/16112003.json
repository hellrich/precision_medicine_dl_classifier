To clarify the clinicopathologic features of PNF and to characterize melanogenesis in PNF, 12 cases of PNF were examined in comparison with schwannoma (SCH, n \u003d 16) and neurofibroma (NF, n \u003d 26). The PNF patients were all Japanese including 7 men and 5 women, and patient age ranged from 11 to 71 years (median, 23.5 years). They showed strong a predisposition for neurofibromatosis type 1. Their tumor size was large, and tumors arose from various sites of skin. Histologically, clusters of epithelioid, dendritic, and spindle melanin-producing cells with faint pigmentation had a tendency to locate in deep dermis and subcutis, which seems to be a characteristic pattern of melanogenesis. There was a transition between melanin-producing cells and Schwann cells. Immunohistochemical examination included known melanogenic markers, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which is a key regulator of melanogenesis, and 2 tyrosine kinase receptors, c-Met and c-Kit, which regulate the development of melanocytes. In PNF, melanin-producing cells were S100 (+), MITF (+), Melan-A (+), tyrosinase (+/-), HMB45 (+/-), c-Met (+), and c-Kit (-). Schwann cells were S100 (+), MITF (-), Melan-A (-), tyrosinase (-), HMB45 (-), c-Met (-), and c-Kit (-), and intermediate spindle cells were S100 (+), MITF (+), Melan-A (+), tyrosinase (-), HMB45 (-), c-Met (+), and c-Kit (-). When compared with SCH and NF, MITF was weakly expressed in a part of tumor cells of SCH, whereas no definite staining was found in NF. c-Met expression was very weak in a scattered manner in SCH (10/15 cases) and NF (10/26 cases). These results suggest that PNF is a unique tumor that shows differentiation toward mature melanin production, but ability of melanin synthesis seems to be impaired. There may be a close relationship between up-regulated MITF and c-Met and the peculiar melanogenic nature of PNF, and both of these are useful diagnostic tools for distinguishing PNFs with less melanin production from NFs.","title":"Pigmented neurofibroma: review of Japanese patients with an analysis of melanogenesis demonstrating coexpression of c-met protooncogene and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor.","pubmedId":"16112003"}
