Treatment options in this population are limited to conventional chemotherapy regimens and antiangiogenesis compounds. Numerous strategies have been proposed in preclinical models as being effective in the presence of KRAS mutations. As basic and translational research further unravels the complex interactions and regulation points in the pathways downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor, more drugs become available for clinical testing. Indeed, there are many ongoing clinical trials that focus on the safety and efficacy of novel compounds in patients with KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer. This is a review of the literature with regard to the rationale of various approaches on this topic and also a summary of the current active clinical trials limited to patients with KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer.","title":"Novel modalities in the treatment of patients with KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"21285867"}
