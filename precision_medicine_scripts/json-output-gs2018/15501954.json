The inhibitors of mTOR as anticancer reagents are undergoing active evaluation in various malignancies including breast cancer. However, the activation status of the Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway and its potential roles in breast cancers remain unknown. Thus, we examined 165 invasive breast cancers with specific antibodies for the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and 4E-BP1 by immunohistochemistry and compared them with normal breast epithelium, fibroadenoma, intraductal hyperplasia, and ductal carcinoma in situ. We discovered that the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and 4E-BP1 increased progressively from normal breast epithelium to hyperplasia and abnormal hyperplasia to tumor invasion. Phosphorylated Akt, mTOR, and 4E-BP1 were positively associated with ErbB2 overexpression. Survival analysis showed that phosphorylation of each of these three markers was associated with poor disease-free survival independently. In vitro, we further confirmed the causal relationship between ErbB2 overexpression and mTOR activation, which was associated with enhanced invasive ability and sensitivity to a mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate the following: (a) high levels of phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and 4E-BP1 in breast cancers, indicating activation of the Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway in breast cancer development and progression; (b) a link between ErbB2 and the Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway in breast cancers in vitro and in vivo, indicating the possible role of Akt/mTOR activation in ErbB2-mediated breast cancer progression; and (c) a potential role for this pathway in predicting the prognosis of patients with breast cancer, especially those treated with mTOR inhibitors.","title":"Activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/4E-BP1 pathway by ErbB2 overexpression predicts tumor progression in breast cancers.","pubmedId":"15501954"}
