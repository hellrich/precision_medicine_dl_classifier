Hdm2 synthesis is itself tightly controlled and, as demonstrated by a recently described SNP (SNP309) in the hdm2-P2 promoter, minor variations in Hdm2 expression have phenotypic consequences on radiation sensitivity and cancer predisposition. To further define mechanisms regulating Hdm2 expression, we have investigated the effects of the GC-selective DNA-binding drug, Mithramycin A (MA) on hdm2 mRNA transcription, trafficking, and translation. Firstly we show that the constitutive hdm2-P1 promoter is inhibited by MA. We define, for the first time, the minimal sequence elements that are required for P1-promoter activity and identify those which confer MA sensitivity. Secondly, MA induces p53-dependent transcription from the hdm2-P2 promoter. Thirdly, and critically, MA also inhibits Hdm2 synthesis at the post-transcriptional level, with negative effects on hdm2 mRNA nuclear export and translation. This study highlights the complex interplay between the pathways that regulate Hdm2 protein synthesis in cancer cells, and furthermore emphasizes the export of hdm2 mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as a key point of control in this process.","title":"GC-selective DNA-binding antibiotic, mithramycin A, reveals multiple points of control in the regulation of Hdm2 protein synthesis.","pubmedId":"16501602"}
