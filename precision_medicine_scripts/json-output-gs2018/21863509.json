Generally neoadjuvant chemotherapy and combined radiochemotherapy are frequently used in this setting. The recent meta-analyses evaluating randomised trials of different neoadjuvant therapy protocols prior to surgery for patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer showed only a modest improvement in survivial of 5-10% survival at 5 years. In contrast, the meta-analyses reveal that patients with excellent histopathological responses seem to highly benefit from neoadjuvant regimens. Patients with poor histopathological responses have no benefit but rather disadvantegeous prognoses. Therefore, predictive markers to allow individualisation of multimodality treatment in locally advanced esophageal cancer are urgently needed.","title":"[Oesophageal cancer: current status of multimodality therapy].","pubmedId":"21863509"}
