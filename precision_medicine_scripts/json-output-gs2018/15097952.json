However, there are only a few population-based studies on acquired nevi in Asian populations, and no epidemiologic study on relationship between number of acquired nevi and melanoma in Japanese populations has been reported.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess number, size, and distribution of acquired melanocytic nevi in a Japanese population. Particular attention was paid to evaluation of relationship between number of acquired nevi and development of nonacral or acral malignant melanoma.\nIn all, 82 patients with malignant melanoma and 600 control subjects were included in this study. All participants were Japanese. The number of acquired melanocytic nevi, 2 mm or larger in diameter, on the whole body except the scalp and genital areas was counted by experienced dermatologists. The participants were divided into 5 age categories (0-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60-79, and \u003e80 years old) for the statistical analyses. This categorization adjusted the age and sex distribution between patients with melanomas and control subjects in 40- to 59-, 60- to 79-, and over 80-year-old groups.\nIn the control Japanese population, the number of acquired melanocytic nevi on the whole body increased with age in 0- to 19-year-old age group and reached the highest number, 6.7 +/- 8.1/person, in 20- to 39-year-old group. In patients with nonacral melanoma, the number of acquired nevi on the whole body in 40- to 59- and 60- to 79-year-old groups was significantly higher than that of the corresponding control group. In contrast, the rate of individuals who had acquired nevi on soles, palms, and nail apparatus was not significantly different between acral melanoma group and the control group in 40- to 59- and 60- to 79-year-old groups.\nThis study has revealed that a large number of acquired melanocytic nevi is a risk factor for the development of nonacral melanoma in Japanese and white populations. However, acquired nevi on soles, palms, and nail apparatus do not seem to be a risk factor for acral melanoma in Japanese populations.","title":"Number of acquired melanocytic nevi in patients with melanoma and control subjects in Japan: Nevus count is a significant risk factor for nonacral melanoma but not for acral melanoma.","pubmedId":"15097952"}
