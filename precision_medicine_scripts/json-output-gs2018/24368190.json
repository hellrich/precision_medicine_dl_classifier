Previously, we reported that IDH1 correlated with pathological grade and metastatic potential inversely in human osteosarcoma. Here, IDH1 was found lower expressed in osteosarcoma tissues than that of adjacent normal bone tissues. In addition, we observed in vitro anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects of up-regulated IDH1 on osteosarcoma cell lines. The migration and invasion activity was also markedly reduced by IDH1 up-regulation. Unexpectedly, IDH1 up-regulation also suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Therefore, IDH1 may represent a potential novel treatment and preventive strategy for osteosarcoma.
