However, the characteristics of IDH1-mutated AML are still not known clearly. We analyzed 416 Chinese AML patients and found 28 patients (6.7%) carried this mutation. One homozygous IDH1 mutant in AML was found. The IDH1 mutations were associated with NPM1 mutations (P\u003d0.043) and could coexist with recurrent transcription factor aberrations including AML1-ETO (6/50), PML-RARα (3/77) and CBFβ-MYH11 (1/15). For AML with AML1-ETO fusion gene, IDH1(mut) patients may have worse disease-free survival (DFS) than IDH1(wild-type) patients.","title":"Some novel features of IDH1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia revealed in Chinese patients.","pubmedId":"21316759"}
