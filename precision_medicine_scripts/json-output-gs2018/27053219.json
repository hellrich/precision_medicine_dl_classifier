Large-scale explorative genomic projects have identified several genes as potential targets for therapy, including fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3).\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the biological significance of wild-type and mutated FGFR3 to evaluate its potential as a novel therapeutic target in HNSCC.\nFGFR3 protein expression was analysed in a large HNSCC tissue cohort (n \u003d 536) and FGFR3 mRNA expression from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n \u003d 520). Moreover, FGFR3 wild-type and mutant versions were overexpressed in vitro, and both proliferation and migration was assessed with and without BGJ398 (a specific FGFR1-3 inhibitor) treatment.\nAlthough FGFR3 expression for both cohorts decreased during tumour progression, high FGFR3 expression levels were observed in a small subset of patients. In vitro, FGFR3 overexpression led to increased proliferation, whereas migration was not altered. Moreover, FGFR3-overexpressing cells were more sensitive to BGJ398. Cells overexpressing FGFR3 mutant versions showed increased proliferation compared to wild-type FGFR3 under serum-reduced conditions and were largely as sensitive as the wild-type protein to BGJ398.\nTaken together, the results of this study demonstrate that although FGFR3 expression decreases during HNSSC progression, it plays an important role in tumour cell proliferation and thus may be a potential target for therapy in selected patients suffering from this dismal tumour entity.","title":"Evaluation of FGFR3 as a Therapeutic Target in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","pubmedId":"27053219"}
