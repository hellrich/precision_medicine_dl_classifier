{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"An apparatus for the measurement of attenuation of light in thin-film waveguides is described. It involves a prism that rides on a liquid film along the guide and couples the light out of the guide. A spatial resolution of ~0.5 mm and an accuracy of 0.02 dB/cm were achieved.","title":"Loss measurements in thin-film optical waveguides.","pubmedId":"20125383"}
