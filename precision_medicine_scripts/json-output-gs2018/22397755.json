Imatinib (IM) effectively targets Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, but development of resistance to IM occurs with varying frequency.\nElucidation of the common regulatory pathway upstream of Bcr-Abl in IM-sensitive and IM-resistant CML cells is important for developing novel therapeutics against CML.\nThis study demonstrated that IM preferentially inhibited the viability and Bcr-Abl expression in IM-sensitive K562 (K562) cells, but not in Bcr-Abl overexpressing IM-resistant K562 (K562R) cells. Both K562 and K562R cells expressed Shh preproprotein, cleaved Shh C-terminal and N-terminal peptides, as well as mRNA level of major Shh signaling molecules, including sonic hedgehog (Shh), patched (PTCH), smoothened (Smo) and Gli-1. Moreover, Gli-1 translocation into nucleus was evident in these two cell lines, suggesting that both K562 and K562R cells possess activated and major components of the Shh signaling pathway. Silencing of Gli-1 by interference RNA was accompanied by inhibition of Bcr-Abl protein expression. Pharmacological suppression of Bcr-Abl expression was restored by the Smo agonist purmorpharmine. Treatment of Shh peptide in both K562 and K562R cells not only increased Shh and Gli-1 expression, but also up-regulated Bcr-Abl expression. Resveratrol, a known Bcr-Abl inhibitor, reduced Gli-1 activation and inhibited the viability of CML cells.\nShh signaling may regulate Bcr-Abl expression in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Novel compounds inhibiting both Shh signaling and Bcr-Abl expression, such as resveratrol, may have potential to be effective agents against CML independent of IM resistance.","title":"Sonic hedgehog signaling regulates Bcr-Abl expression in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells.","pubmedId":"22397755"}
