The aim of current study is to determine the prognostic significance of galectin-1 expression level in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy (RT).Materials and Methods: We included 45 patients with GBM who treated with maximal safe surgical resection or biopsy only, followed by adjuvant RT of EQD2 \u003e\u003d 60 Gy (equivalent doses as 2-Gy fractions) for homogeneous treatment. Paraffin-embedded tissues acquired from the Department of Pathology were analyzed using immunohistochemistry staining for galectin-1 expression. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival were compared between strong and weak expression of galectin-1.Results: According to univariate analysis for optimal cutoff of galectin-1 expression level, better median survival (27.9 months) in patients with weak level than that (10.7 months) in patients with strong level (p \u003d 0.009) was revealed. We compared characteristics between weak and strong galectin-1 expression level, and only galectin-3 expression level was correlated. The weak galectin-1 expression group displayed a 3-year survival rate of 27.3% and 3-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) rate of 27.3%, but which are only 5.9% and 7.6% respectively in strong galectin-1 expression group (p \u003d 0.009 and 0.020, respectively). Cox regression was used to confirm that the role of galectin-1 expression level (weak vs. strong) is a significant factor of OS (p \u003d 0.020) and CSS (p \u003d 0.022). Other parameters such as galectin-3 expression level, ECOG performance, gender, operation method, age \u003e 50 years, or radiation field were not significant factors.Conclusion: Galectin-1 expression level affects OS and CSS in patient with GBM treated with adjuvant RT.","title":"Prognostic significance of galectin-1 expression in patients with glioblastoma multiforme following radiotherapy.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-4753"}
