Therefore in recent times, the focus of several studies was on use of FLT3 as a prognostic marker. The present study investigated the molecular characterization and incidence of FLT3 mutations in acute leukemia patients in Pakistan. A total of 55 patients were studied, of which 25 were suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 30 were suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The polymerase chain reaction demonstrated FLT3/ ITD mutations in 1 (4%) of 25 ALL patients, a male with the L2 subtype. In AML cases the rate was 4 (13.3%) of 30, three males and one female. The AML-M4 subtype was found in three and the AML M2 subtype in the other. In the AML cases, a statistically significant (p\u003d0.009) relationship was found between WBC (109/L) and FLT3/ ITD positivity. However, no significant relationship was found with other clinical parameters (p\u003e0.05). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) FLT3/ITD+ mutation was more prevalent in elderly patients 31-40 age groups, 21-30 and 51-60 age groups respectively. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) statistically no significant relationship was found between clinical features and FLT3/ITD positivity (p\u003e0.05). However, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) FLT3/ITD+ mutation was more commonly found in age groups of 21-30.","title":"Molecular characterization of FLT3 mutations in acute leukemia patients in Pakistan.","pubmedId":"23167384"}
