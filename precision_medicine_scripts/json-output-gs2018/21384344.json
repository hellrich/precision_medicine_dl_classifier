We have previously demonstrated that BEX2 expression protects breast cancer cells against mitochondrial apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest. In addition, we have shown that BEX2 is a c-Jun target gene and, in turn, regulates the phosphorylation of c-Jun in breast cancer cells. In our study, we investigated BEX2 protein expression in a tissue microarray cohort of 225 breast tissue samples with known clinical, pathological and biomarker information. We observed that BEX2 protein was overexpressed in âˆ¼50% of malignant breast tumors compared to only 7% of benign breast samples. Notably, BEX2 positive tumors identified a subset of breast cancers with the overexpression of ErbB2 and phosphorylated c-Jun proteins. Furthermore, using in vitro models, we demonstrated that the mechanism of this association is a functional feedback loop involving ErbB2, c-Jun and BEX2 in breast cancer cells. In this feedback loop, ErbB2 overexpression results in an induction of c-Jun and BEX2 expression. Importantly, ErbB2 induction of BEX2 expression was abrogated by a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun, suggesting that this effect was mediated through the regulation of c-Jun signaling. In turn, the overexpression of BEX2 led to an increase in both c-Jun-mediated induction of ErbB2 and c-Jun binding to the ErbB2 promoter in MCF-7 cells. Our study suggests that BEX2 protein is overexpressed in approximately half of breast cancers and has a positive feedback loop with ErbB2 mediated by c-Jun signaling in breast cancer cells.","title":"A feedback loop between BEX2 and ErbB2 mediated by c-Jun signaling in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"21384344"}
