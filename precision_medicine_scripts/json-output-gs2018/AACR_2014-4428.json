ERBB3/HER3, the only ERBB family member with an impaired kinase domain, upon ligand binding heterodimerizes with ERBB2 to promote signaling. While amplification and overexpression of ERBB3 is observed in some cancers, occurrence and relevance of ERBB3 somatic mutations in oncogenesis is not established. Here we report the identification of ERBB3 somatic mutations in 11% of colon and gastric cancers. We found that the ERBB3 mutants together with ERBB2 promote oncogenic signaling and transformed colonic and breast epithelial cells in a ligand independent manner. Further, we found that multiple target therapeutics that acts on ERBB3, ERBB2 or their downstream signaling components are effective in blocking ERBB3-mutant mediated oncogenic signaling and disease progression in vivo. Identification of activating ERBB3 mutations along with the established contribution of ERBB3 to acquired resistance to EGFR/ERBB2-targeted drugs provides a rational to therapeutically target ERBB3.","title":"Oncogenic ERBB3 mutations in human cancers","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4428"}
