Other antigens are present in tumor tissue and the sera of patients with MTC, but there are scarce published data on the serum levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (Ca 19-9), a tumor marker primarily used for the diagnosis and follow-up of pancreatic and gastrointestinal neoplasias. Recently, the case of a 56-year-old woman with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B with high serum levels of Ca 19-9 was reported; this patient experienced rapid disease progression that led to her death.\nA 28-year-old man was referred to the Department of Endocrinology of the University Hospital of Pisa with suspected MTC with laterocervical lymph node metastasis, a single liver lesion (10 mm), several bone metastases, and bilateral pheochromocytomas. RET genetic testing revealed a germline Cys634Arg mutation. During the hospitalization, the carcinoembryonic antigen and Ca 19-9 levels increased while the calcitonin concentration remained stable; despite the apparent stability of the lesions, the condition of the patient worsened rapidly and resulted in death.\nHigh levels of serum Ca 19-9 could be considered a marker of the dedifferentiation of MTC and disease aggressiveness, but additional data on the association between Ca 19-9 and advanced MTC are required to confirm this hypothesis.","title":"Medullary thyroid cancer secreting carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (Ca 19-9): a fatal case report.","pubmedId":"23861463"}
