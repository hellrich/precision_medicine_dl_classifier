With regard to these problems, it is very important to have the possibility to analyze, through the use of cytogenetics, both the primary melanoma and the metastatic lesions from the same patient. We present a case in which the primary melanoma and five different metastases were studied by using cytogenetics. The primary tumor showed an inversion of chromosome 1 where the p36 region, often proposed in literature as the location of a melanoma susceptibility gene, was involved. Three cutaneous and one lymphonodal metastases presented the same nine clonal chromosomal aberrations. In particular, one is a further rearrangement of the marker present in the primary tumor; another is a deletion of the 9p21pter region in which the p16 gene is located. Our results can provide a contribution to the hypothesis of the location of a candidate gene for melanoma in the 1p36 region and can also underscore the role of the 9p21 region in the progression of melanoma.","title":"Cytogenetic follow-up in a case with a primary cutaneous melanoma and five metastatic lesions.","pubmedId":"9877103"}
