To investigate whether the LGI1 gene is a susceptibility gene for febrile seizures (FS), we performed a systematic search for mutations in 94 unrelated Japanese patients with FS. We detected two intronic polymorphisms (IVS2 + 19 A/G and IVS6 - 18 T/C). No non-synonymous mutation was detected. We genotyped these polymorphisms and performed a case-control study and transmission disequilibrium testing (TDT) of 62 FS families (n \u003d 230) and 105 control subjects. None of the polymorphisms was significantly associated with FS. Our results indicate that genomic variations in the LGI1 gene are not likely to be substantially involved in the etiology of FS in the Japanese population.","title":"Mutation analysis of the leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 gene (LGI1) in Japanese febrile seizure patients.","pubmedId":"14598228"}
