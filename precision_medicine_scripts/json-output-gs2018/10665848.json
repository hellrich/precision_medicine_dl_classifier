In 1974-1998, 18 602 patients were operated on due to goitre. There were 975 (5.2%) patients with thyroid malignant neoplasms. The group comprised 449 (46.1%) patients with papillary carcinoma, 309 (31.7%) with follicular carcinoma, 54 (5.5%) with medullary carcinoma, 106 (10.9%) with anaplastic carcinoma, and 57 (5.8%) with other types of thyroid malignant neoplasms. Out of these 975 patients, thyroid cancer was diagnosed on the basis of the detection of a metastatic tumor in 26 (2.7%) patients. In 16 (61.5%) of these patients the metastatic tumor was located in the regional lymph nodes. In 10 (38.5%) patients distant metastasis beyond the regional lymph nodes was the first sign of thyroid cancer. In (50%) patients metastasis was located in the bones, in 2 (20%) in the lung, in 1 (10%) in the heart, in 1 (10%) in the buttock, and in 1 (10%) in a central neck cyst. Metastasis was the initial manifestation of thyroid cancer in 18 (4%) of 449 papillary carcinoma patients, in 6 of 309 (1.9%) follicular carcinoma patients, and in 2 (3.7%) of 54 medullary carcinoma patients. Lymph node metastasis was the first sign of thyroid cancer in 13 (2.9%) patients with papillary carcinoma, 1 (0.3%) patients with follicular carcinoma and in 2 (3.7%) medullary carcinoma patients, and distant metastasis in 5 (1.1%) patients with papillary carcinoma and in 5 (1.6%) patients with follicular carcinoma. After the detection of the primary focus of thyroid cancer total thyroidectomy and modified neck dissection were performed in all patients. Differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients were treated complementarily with 131I and TSH suppressive doses of L-thyroxine, and medullary cancer patients with teleradiotherapy and substitutive doses of L-thyroxine.","title":"Metastasis as the first sign of thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"10665848"}
