Expression of a multidrug resistance gene (mdr1) that codes for 170 Kd transmembrane glycoprotein is responsible for conferring resistance to malignant cells to anthracyclines. The t(9:22) translocation, resulting in bcr-abl fusion gene, is commonly found in B-lineage ALL and is known to be a poor prognostic factor for long-term remission. To investigate whether resistance to anthracyclines contributes to poor prognosis in bcr-abl-positive ALL, we studied daunorubicin sensitivity by an in vitro colorimetric methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay in B-lineage ALL patients who were bcr-abl-positive and compared them with the B-lineage, age-matched bcr-abl-negative group. We also looked for and compared the presence of mdr1 gene expression in these two groups of patients by RT-PCR. Of the 46 patients included in the study, 16 (34.7%) were positive for the bcr-abl fusion gene. mdr1 gene expression was seen in 14 of these 46 patients (30.4%). However, the expression of the mdr1 gene was relatively lower in the bcr-abl-positive group (3 out of 16, 18.7%) compared to the bcr-abl-negative group (11 out of 30, 36.6%). The median LD(50) of daunorubicin (concentration lethal to 50% of the leukemic blasts) differed significantly between bcr-abl-positive and -negative patients (P \u003d 0.018). This in vitro study suggests that bcr-abl-positive ALL is relatively resistant to daunorubicin, but this resistance is not mediated through mdr1 gene expression.","title":"Resistance of bcr-abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia to daunorubicin is not mediated by mdr1 gene expression.","pubmedId":"12410571"}
