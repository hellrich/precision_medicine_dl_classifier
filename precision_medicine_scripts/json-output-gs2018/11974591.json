We report on a 63-year-old male presenting with a relapse of an epithelioid sarcoma. At clinical inspection, the tumor presented as an erythematous nodule with ulceration in the center. Despite its slow growth, epithelioid sarcoma should be regarded as an aggressive neoplasm exhibiting frequent local recurrences and subsequent lymphatic and visceral spreading in about half of the patients. Histopathological findings are the presence of large epithelioid and spindle cells with immunoreactivity for cytokeratin and vimentin.","title":"[Recurrence of an epithelioid sarcoma of the scalp].","pubmedId":"11974591"}
