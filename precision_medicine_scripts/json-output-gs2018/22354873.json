There was a trend suggesting that the loss of p16(INK4A) expression was more frequent in higher T stages, however, this was found only in patients without lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.059). A poorer prognosis and a higher risk of tumor recurrence were found in OSCCs without p16(INK4A) expression. (The HR for cancer-specific mortality and cancer recurrence was 3.55 and 1.89, respectively.)\nAlthough it has been suggested that BQ chewers had a greater tendency toward tumor recurrence and poor outcome, our data demonstrated that p16(INK4A) expression is unrelated to BQ habit and that p16(INK4A) downregulation is a strong predictor for OSCC progression, recurrence and survival in Taiwan.","title":"Analysis of p16(INK4A) expression of oral squamous cell carcinomas in Taiwan: prognostic correlation without relevance to betel quid consumption.","pubmedId":"22354873"}
