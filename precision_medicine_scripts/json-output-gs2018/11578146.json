SM alkylates DNA, leading to DNA strand breaks and cell death in a variety of cell types and tissues. Although several approaches have been proposed to challenge the toxic action(s) of SM, no satisfactory treatment regimen has evolved. The synthetic aminothiol amifostine, earlier known as WR-2721 (S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethyl phosphorothioate), has been extensively used as a chemical radioprotector for the normal tissues in cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy. SM is known as a radiomimetic agent and this prompted us to evaluate the protective efficacy of amifostine (2.5 mM) and three of its analogues, DRDE-06 (S-2 (3-aminopropylamino) ethyl phenyl sulfide), DRDE-07 (S-2 (2-aminoethylamino) ethyl phenyl sulfide), and DRDE-08 (S-2 (4-aminobutylamino) ethyl phenyl sulfide), against SM toxicity in rat liver slices. Of the four agents tested, a 30-min pretreatment of amifostine and DRDE-07 enhanced the LC50 (a concentration producing 50% leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) of SM by 5.9- and 3.3-fold for LDH and 10.2- and 5.5-fold for ALT, respectively. Except DNA fragmentation, both these agents significantly attenuated the loss of intracellular K(+) and mitochondrial integrity (MTT assay), depletion of GSH levels, and histopathology produced by a toxic concentration (80 microM) of SM. However, when amifostine and DRDE-07 were introduced 2 h after SM, no significant protection was observed. SM (77.5 or 155 mg/kg) was also applied dermally on female albino mice and challenged by 0.20 LD50 (po) of amifostine, DRDE-06, DRDE-07, or DRDE-08 at -30 min, 0 min, or +6 h. Protection was observed only when the agents were administered at -30 min or 0 min; posttreatment (+6 h) did not offer any protection. The magnitude of in vivo protection was in the following order: DRDE-07 \u003eor\u003d amifostine \u003e DRDE-08 \u003e DRDE-06. Gas chromatographic analysis showed that there was no direct chemical interaction between SM and the antidotes. The po LD50s of amifostine, DRDE-06, DRDE-07, and DRDE-08 were 1049, 1345, 1248, and 951 mg/kg, respectively. Both in vitro and in vivo data indicate promising roles of amifostine and DRDE-07 as prophylactic agents against SM poisoning.","title":"Protective effects of amifostine and its analogues on sulfur mustard toxicity in vitro and in vivo.","pubmedId":"11578146"}
