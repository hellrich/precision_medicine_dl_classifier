Comprehensive molecular diagnostics (EGFR-, ALK-, RAS-, BRAF-, PIK3CA-, HER2- and DDR2-aberrations) were performed and failed initially to detect any driver mutation. While the patient suffered from rapid deterioration of her general condition, in particular from progressive dyspnea due to lung metastases, we implemented screening for RET- and ROS1 translocations into our molecular diagnostic program based on recent reports of these new molecular subgroups in lung adenocarcinoma. On retesting the patient\u0027s tumor sample was found to harbor a ROS1-translocation. The patient was subsequently treated with crizotinib and experienced a pronounced clinical improvement corresponding to a complete metabolic response in (18)F-FDG-PET and a good and confirmed partial response in CT (RECIST 1.1). Our case exemplifies the need for rapid implementation of newly discovered rare genetic lung cancer subtypes in routine molecular diagnostics.","title":"Complete metabolic response in a patient with repeatedly relapsed non-small cell lung cancer harboring ROS1 gene rearrangement after treatment with crizotinib.","pubmedId":"23558310"}
