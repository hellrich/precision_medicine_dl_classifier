Further, FLT3-ITD has not been systematically analyzed for outcome from Indian subcontinent. Amongst 64 consecutive pediatric AML patients, FLT3-ITD was present in 12 (19%) patients. All patients with FLT3-ITD achieved CR; those with FLT3-ITD mutation had inferior DFS (P \u003d .029). FLT3 expression by flow-cytometry was observed in all FLT3-ITD positive patients, whereas 40/52 (77%) FLT3-ITD negative patients expressed FLT3 (P \u003d .06). FLT3 expression in 12 FLT3-ITD positive patients was unable to show an association between FLT3 expression and outcome. In FLT3-ITD negative patients, higher surface expression of FLT3 significantly predicted poor EFS (P \u003d .001) and OS (P \u003d .007).
