Brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) within GBM tumors resist standard treatments, initiate recurrence, and pose a significant challenge for GBM treatment. This study examined Gli1 expression and proliferation of GBM cells in vitro to evaluate the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D3). Vitamin D3 is a safe, natural inhibitor of the hedgehog signaling pathwaya mechanism essential to BTSC function. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that both established GBM cell lines and GBM-derived BTSCs expressed Gli1, indicating hedgehog signaling pathway activity within the cell populations. Vitamin D3 treatment significantly reduced cell proliferation, both in GBM cell lines and GBM-derived BTSCs. Because of active vitamin D3\u0027s environmental instability, an in vivo model might provide a better indication of its anti-tumor effects. Ultimately, vitamin D3 may enhance standard GBM treatments by inhibiting hedgehog-expressing cells.","title":"1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits the proliferation of cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-3358"}
