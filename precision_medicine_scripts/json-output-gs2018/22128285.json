This review provides an overview of the evidence to support c-MET or the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway as relevant targets for personalized cancer treatment based on high frequencies of c-MET and/or HGF overexpression, activation, amplification in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, thyroid, breast, head and neck, colon and kidney carcinomas. Additionally, the current knowledge of small molecule inhibitors (tivantinib [ARQ 197]), c-MET/HGF antibodies (rilotumumab and MetMAb) and mechanisms of resistance to c-MET-targeted therapies are discussed.","title":"c-MET as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker in cancer.","pubmedId":"22128285"}
