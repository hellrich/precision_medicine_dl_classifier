But it is not known whether clinical response to induction anti-CTLA4 treatment would translate into an OS benefit. Furthermore, predictors of response to anti-CTLA4 agents are not well-established.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis on one hundred patients treated with anti-CTLA4 agents from 2006-2013 in two tertiary cancer centers in Alberta, Canada. Clinical and tumor characteristics, treatment response, toxicity, and survival data were collected through chart review. Clinicians evaluated response based on immune related response criteria. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test and cox proportional hazards model to compare variable groups and univariable analysis using logistic regression to look for factors associated with clinical response to anti-CTLA4 agents. All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS software.  Results:   Striking differences in median OS (mOS) were observed in responders, defined as complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR), and non-responders defined as stable disease (SD) plus progressive disease (PD) (not reached; greater than 36.1 versus 6.9 months, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-10.9, p\u003c0.0001, respectively). A 9 fold difference in mOS was seen between patients with disease control (CR+PR+SD) and those with PD on induction treatment: 36.1 months (95%CI: 22.9-51.4) versus 4.0 months (95%CI: 3-6.7), respectively (p \u003c0.0001). Only host-tumor immunological parameters were associated with a response to anti-CTLA4 treatment. Brisk, as opposed to non-brisk, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the primary tumor (p\u003d0.003) and immune mediated side effects (p\u003d0.048) were associated with response in univariable analysis.  Conclusions:  Our retrospective study, although limited by small population size, reveals that response to induction anti-CTLA4 agents is a dominant predictor for survival. Host-tumor immunological parameters may be important determinants for response to anti-CTLA4 agents, although these need to be prospectively validated.","title":"The impact of clinical response to anti-CTLA4 treatment on overall survival (OS) in metastatic melanoma (MM).","pubmedId":"ASCO_132954-144"}
