The drugs which were used were cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil and procarbazine. All patients had advanced disease and 6 of them had had previous surgical excision of the primary tumor. A large proportion of the patients had received irradiation to the primary site prior to chemotherapy. 1 patient developed a complete remission, 5 developed a partial remission and 34 showed stabilization of their disease. In 21 patients the disease progressed in spite of the treatment. Responders had a significantly longer survival than non-responding patients.","title":"[Chemotherapy of the non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"6189039"}
