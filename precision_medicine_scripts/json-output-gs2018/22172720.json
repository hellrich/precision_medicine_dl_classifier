Although it is well known that Wnt signaling is frequently dysregulated in melanoma, the functional implications of this observation are unclear. By modulating β-catenin levels in a mouse model of melanoma that is based on melanocyte-specific Pten loss and Braf(V600E) mutation, we demonstrate that β-catenin is a central mediator of melanoma metastasis to the lymph nodes and lungs. In addition to altering metastasis, β-catenin levels control tumor differentiation and regulate both MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt signaling. Highly metastatic tumors with β-catenin stabilization are very similar to a subset of human melanomas. Together these findings establish Wnt signaling as a metastasis regulator in melanoma.","title":"β-catenin signaling controls metastasis in Braf-activated Pten-deficient melanomas.","pubmedId":"22172720"}
