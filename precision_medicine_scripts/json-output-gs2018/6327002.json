All patients have been followed for a minimum of 5 years after the treatment of recurrences. An extensive analysis was done in search of prognosticators for outcome in recurrent breast cancer. Traditional prognostic factors, such as the initial axillary status, primary surgical procedure, initial menopausal status, time and site of recurrences, distant metastases and radiation dose and field issues, were investigated. No correlation was found between the initial axillary status and the overall prognosis after recurrence. The main prognosticators were: the size of the initial breast tumor, the radiation treatment for recurrences, and the presence of, or time to, distant metastases. Initial T1-T2 breast tumors were associated with a delayed onset of recurrences and a lower incidence of chest wall relapses; in turn, both the latter situations yielded the best outcome. Radiation doses of more than 4000 rad in 4 weeks delivered with locoregional fields achieved a local control rate of 72%, and the best 5-year post-recurrence survival (57%). In 52% of the recurrent breast cancer patients, distant metastases were discovered; 70% of them occurred within 2 years from recurrence. The overall post-recurrence 5-year survival for the entire series was 40%. Both the results achieved with radiation therapy and the need for a logical strategy to approach the problem of breast cancer recurrences are discussed. The situation for a large proportion of these patients is not hopeless, and many are salvagable . Combined modality approaches could offer the best possibilities of survival. However, the importance of radiation therapy in the management of these patients cannot be denied or ignored.","title":"Prognosticators in recurrent breast cancer.
