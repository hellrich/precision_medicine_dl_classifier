It has been associated with frequent skin toxicity, including photosensitivity, rash and squamous cell carcinomas. We present an 83-year-old woman with an advanced V600E BRAF-mutant melanoma who developed a severe skin rash and fatigue after taking vemurafenib. The dose was reduced from 960 to 720 to 480Â mg twice a day; however, she was subsequently admitted to the hospital with fever, chills, fatigue, confusion and a diffuse skin eruption. She then developed hypoxia and acute renal failure that required hemodialysis. A biopsy of her skin lesions revealed a neutrophilic dermatitis with papillary dermal edema, consistent with Sweet\u0027s syndrome. Her symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of vemurafenib and treatment with prednisone. This constellation of symptoms and clinical course are consistent with drug-induced Sweet\u0027s syndrome caused by vemurafenib.
