Established reference populations with other chronic medical conditions, or breast, prostate or other cancers were used for comparison of health related quality of life scores. General health related quality of life was measured with a RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0. Cancer targeted quality of life was measured with the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System-Short Form. Sociodemographic and co-morbidity variables were also collected.\nGeneral health related quality of life in patients treated with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and interleukin-2 was significantly better than that in heart failure patients on 1 of 8 scales but significantly worse than in the general population on 6 of 8 scales. General health related quality of life in the former patients was also significantly worse than in those with hypertension on 5 of 8 scales and significantly worse than in diabetics on 2 scales. Cancer targeted health related quality of life in patients given immunotherapy was significantly better than in men with prostate cancer on 1 of 5 scales, significantly better than in women with breast cancer on 2 of 5 scales and significantly better than patients with other cancers (nonbreast and nonprostate) on 3 of 5 scales.\nPatients undergoing nephrectomy and adjuvant tumor infiltrating lymphocytes plus interleukin-2 therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma report better health related quality of life than those with other malignancies and better physical function than patients with congestive heart failure. However, health related quality of life is worse than in the general population and similar or worse than in patients with hypertension or type II diabetes. This surveyed population is selective and may represent the best responders among survivors of a highly toxic therapy. Nevertheless, quality and quantity of life should be addressed with patients when considering immunotherapy for metastatic kidney cancer.","title":"Health related quality of life outcomes in patients treated for metastatic kidney cancer: a pilot study.","pubmedId":"9112487"}
