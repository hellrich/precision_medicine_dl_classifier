We prospectively examined the association of atrophic gastritis, a pre-malignant condition for gastric cancer and long-term sequelae common to many exposure factors, and the risk of incident CRC.\nA total of 20,928 Finnish male smokers, aged 50-69, who were participants in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC) had serum pepsinogen I (SPGI) levels measured. Participants with low SPGI levels (\u003c 25 microg/l; n \u003d 1,665) were invited for gastroscopy. Of these, 1,059 (63.6%) participants underwent gastroscopy and atrophic gastritis was histologically confirmed in 1,006 (95.0%) participants. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate the risk of incident CRC.\nDuring a mean follow-up of 11.3 years (236,258 person-years), 425 incident CRCs were diagnosed. The incidence rates were 1.82, 1.48, and 1.82 per 1,000 person-years of follow-up for participants with normal SPGI (\u003e or \u003d25 microg/l), low SPGI, and histologically confirmed atrophic gastritis, respectively. Compared to subjects with normal SPGI, there was no increased risk of CRC among subjects with low SPGI (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) \u003d 0.71; 95% CI: 0.47-1.05) and among those with histologically confirmed atrophic gastritis (Adjusted HR \u003d 0.86; 95% CI: 0.55-1.34).\nAtrophic gastritis is not associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer among male smokers.","title":"Atrophic gastritis and the risk of incident colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"19838812"}
