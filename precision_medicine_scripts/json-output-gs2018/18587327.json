Although they usually have an indolent behavior, adenoid cystic carcinomas can be more aggressive, with 5-year survival as low as 55%. Unfortunately, these tumors do not respond well to chemotherapy. In contrast to the most common subtypes of lung carcinomas, epidermal growth factor receptor studies have not been carried out in this group of tumors. Herein we report a series of 24 cases (12 adenoid cystic and 12 mucoepidermoid carcinomas) tested for epidermal growth factor receptor protein expression, epidermal growth factor receptor gene copy gains, and epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutational status, through immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and sequencing of the exons 18-21, respectively. Overall, 91 and 92% of the adenoid cystic carcinomas and mucoepidermoid carcinomas expressed epidermal growth factor receptor protein. Chromosome 7 polysomy occurred in 25% of the cases (four adenoid cystic carcinomas and two mucoepidermoid carcinomas). No epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification was detected and no mutation was found in exons 18-21 of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. Immunoexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor in salivary gland-type lung carcinomas is not related to epidermal growth factor receptor gene copy number or mutational status.","title":"Salivary gland-type lung carcinomas: an EGFR immunohistochemical, molecular genetic, and mutational analysis study.","pubmedId":"18587327"}
