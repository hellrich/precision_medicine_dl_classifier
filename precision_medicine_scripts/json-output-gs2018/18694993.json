As such, we evaluated the association of B7-H3 expression with clinicopathologic outcomes in patients treated for ccRCC.\nNephrectomy specimens from 743 consecutive patients treated for ccRCC at our institution from 1990 to 1999 were evaluated for B7-H3 expression by immunohistochemical staining. Associations of B7-H3 expression with clinical and pathologic features were evaluated using chi2 and Fisher\u0027s exact tests. Associations of B7-H3 expression with death from RCC were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.\nB7-H3 expression by tumor cells or tumor vasculature was noted in 17% and 95% of specimens, respectively. The presence of either tumor cell or diffuse tumor vasculature expression of B7-H3 was present in 46% of specimens and was associated with multiple adverse clinical and pathologic features. After multivariable adjustment, the presence of either tumor cell or diffuse tumor vasculature B7-H3 expression was significantly associated with an increased risk of death from RCC (risk ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.84; P \u003d 0.029).\nBoth tumor cell and tumor vasculature B7-H3 expression convey important information to predict ccRCC outcomes. Collectively, our past and present studies pertaining to B7-H ligand expression indicate that ccRCC may use redundant mechanisms to compromise host antitumoral immunity. Future studies will focus on the effect of combined B7-H ligand expression in RCC.","title":"Tumor cell and tumor vasculature expression of B7-H3 predict survival in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"18694993"}
