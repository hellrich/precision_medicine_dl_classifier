These genes were colocalized to chromosome 9p21, and p16 was subsequently found to be mutated in familial melanoma and deleted in a wide variety of sporadic cancers. We recently found that de novo methylation of a 5\u0027 CpG island led to transcriptional block of full-length p16 in many neoplasms. However, the presence of a truncated p16 transcript in methylated cell lines led us to investigate the presence of an alternative promoter or initiation site. We have now identified an abundant alternative p16 transcript in both methylated and unmethylated cell lines generated from a novel sequence (exon 1 beta) potentially involved in the complex regulation of these critical cell cycle genes.","title":"A novel p16INK4A transcript.","pubmedId":"7541708"}
