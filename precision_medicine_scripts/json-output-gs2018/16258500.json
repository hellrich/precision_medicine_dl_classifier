As demonstrated by cytogenetics and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, between 70% and over 90% of clear cell sarcomas have a t(12;22) translocation, fusing the EWS and ATF1 genes on chromosomes 22q12 and 12q13, respectively. Identification of this translocation distinguishes clear cell sarcoma from histologic mimics, most importantly conventional malignant melanoma. We report our experience with a commercially available, dual-color, break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe, which allows detection of EWS (22q12) gene rearrangement in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Histologically and immunophenotypically well-characterized cases of clear cell sarcoma (n \u003d 10) and malignant melanoma (n \u003d 32) were evaluated with a 22q12 dual-color, break-apart probe (Vysis, Downer\u0027s Grove, IL, USA), which spans the known common breakpoints in the EWS gene on chromosome 22 (introns 7-10). Signals from tumor cell nuclei were counted under a fluorescence microscope and the presence of red-green break-apart signals was recorded. Of the clear cell sarcoma cases, seven of 10 showed evidence of an EWS gene rearrangement with a mean of 81.6% positive cells per sample (range: 60-95%). All cases of malignant melanoma (n \u003d 32) showed virtually absent break-apart signals in the EWS gene (less than 4% cells per case). FISH detects EWS gene rearrangement in a substantial proportion of clear cell sarcomas, with excellent specificity. Importantly, EWS FISH is negative in malignant melanoma, a clinically dissimilar tumor, which may closely mimic clear cell sarcoma histologically and immunohistochemically. As the studied probe can be utilized in routinely processed tissue, FISH provides an excellent alternative to reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in cases where fresh tissue is unavailable.","title":"Dual-color, break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization for EWS gene rearrangement distinguishes clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue from malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"16258500"}
