All had normal haemoglobin, (mean +/- SD 153 +/- 9 g/l; 9.5 +/- 0.6 mmol/l). Median S-ferritin was 151 micrograms/l, 5-95 percentile 46-588 micrograms/l, observed range 33-1166 micrograms/l. None had depleted iron stores (S-ferritin less than or equal to 20 micrograms/l), 2.5% had \u0027small\u0027 iron stores (S-ferritin 21-40 micrograms/l), 80.5% had \u0027normal\u0027 iron stores (S-ferritin 41-300 micrograms/l) and 17% had \u0027increased\u0027 iron stores (S-ferritin greater than 300 micrograms/l). Transferrin saturation values were greater than 16% in all males; high values greater than 50% were found in 9.3%, and the combination of high transferrin saturation and S-ferritin greater than 300 micrograms/l was found in 3.4% of the males. Median P-ascorbic acid was 26 mumol/l, 5-95 percentile 7-67 mumol/l; significantly higher in subjects taking vitamin supplements (n \u003d 35, median 50 mumol/l) than in those not taking supplements (n \u003d 81, median 23 mumol/l) (p less than 0.0001). There was no correlation between P-ascorbic acid and iron status markers. The results indicate a high frequency of ample iron reserves in the Faroese male population.","title":"Serum ferritin, iron status and plasma ascorbic acid in 40- to 49-year-old males in the Faroe Islands.","pubmedId":"2237268"}
