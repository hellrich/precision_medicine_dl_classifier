Previous studies detected ret/PTC rearrangements more frequently in PTC from children than adults, and recent reports describe a high incidence of BRAF T1796A transversion in adult PTC. However, BRAF mutations have not been adequately studied in PTC from young patients. We amplified and sequenced segments of the BRAF gene spanning the T1796A transversion site in 14 PTC from patients 10-21 years of age (mean, 17.5 +/- 3.5 years). The PTC (7 \u003d class 1; 5 \u003d class 2; 1 \u003d class 3) ranged from 0.7-2.9 cm in diameter (mean, 1.4 +/- 0.75 cm). None of them (0/14) contained BRAF T1796A and none recurred (mean follow-up, 66 +/- 40 months). This incidence of BRAF T1796A is significantly less than that reported for adult PTC (270/699, 38.6%, p \u003d 0.0015) in several series. None of our PTC (0/10) contained ras mutations, but 7/12 (58%) contained ret/PTC rearrangements. We conclude that BRAF mutations are less common in PTC from young patients, and ret/PTC rearrangements were the most common mutation found in these childhood PTC.","title":"BRAF mutations are uncommon in papillary thyroid cancer of young patients.","pubmedId":"15876153"}
