Methods: We identified OC patients (pts, N \u003d 113) treated with NCT from 2002-2014. Stromal TILs (sTILs) were evaluated according to the International TILs Working Group 2014 (Salgado 2015) and intra-epithelial (ieTILs) semi-quantitatively scored (0-3) on whole sections. Cutoffs for analysis were: high sTILs  50%, high ieTILs  2, sTILs change post- vs pre-NCT  10% absolute increase or decrease. PDL1 (E1L3N clone, Cell Signaling) was positive (+) if  5% immune cells had membranous staining, AFA fixed samples were excluded. Results: In pre-NCT tumors, the level of sTILs varied (range: 2%-90%, median 20%), with 22% (25/113) showing high sTILs. Among evaluable paired samples, sTILS increased significantly post-NCT (median sTILs: 20% vs 30%, P 0.05) with 42/83 (52%) of pts showing increased sTILs after NCT, 21/83 decreased, and 20/83 stable. In pre-NCT tumors median ieTILs score was 1 (0-3), with high ieTILs in 24% of pts. Among pts with paired samples evaluable for PDL1, 63% (17/27) of post-NCT samples were PDL1+ vs only 30% (8/27) of pre-NCT (p \u003d 0.04), and 63% (12/19) went from PDL1- to PDL1+ after NCT. Median follow-up was 52 months (95%CI 41-61). In univariate analysis, every 10% increase in sTILs levels in pre- or post-NCT tumors, resulted in a 12% (HR 0.88, 95%CI 0.79-0.97, P 0.01) or 9% (HR 0.91, 95%CI 0.83-1.0, P 0.04) decrease in relapse event, respectively. As a binary variable, pts with high sTILs pre- or post-NCT had a HR for relapse of 0.46 (95%CI 0.25-0.84, p 0.01) and 0.53 (95%CI 0.32-0.89, P 0.02), respectively. In multivariate analysis controlling for complete resection, grade and BRCA-status, high sTILs pre-CT remained an independent positive prognostic factor (HR 0.49, 95%CI 0.26-0.90 P 0.02). ieTILs and PDL1 expression were not prognostic. Conclusions: In OC, sTILs levels are prognostic at diagnosis and remain prognostic after NCT. TILs and PDL1 increase in more than half of pts following NCT. Evaluation of immune parameters in the post-NCT tumor, may inform appropriate selection of pts for novel maintenance immune strategies.","title":"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PDL1 expression in ovarian cancer (OC): Evolution with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) and prognostic value.","pubmedId":"ASCO_165376-176"}
