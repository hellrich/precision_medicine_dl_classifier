The sex ratio between young and old patients was similar but, as expected, the younger patients were in better physical condition. Furthermore, 90% of young patients were treated, compared with only 78% of the older patients. Younger patients had a higher incidence of oropharyngeal tumours and lymph node metastases, but the proportion of poorly differentiated tumours, and stage T3-T4 tumours, was similar, as was the metastatic rate. The crude survival of the younger patients was 10% better than that of the older group, and adjusted (life-table) survival was 9% better, and this better survival in younger patients was significant when differing site incidence and N-stage were allowed for by multivariate analysis. The recurrence rate at the primary site was 19% in the younger patients and 15% in older patients, but this difference was not significant. The recurrence rate in cervical lymph nodes was similar in both age groups: 37% at 2 years in young patients and 38% in older patients.","title":"Squamous carcinoma of the head and neck in the young adult.","pubmedId":"1555311"}
