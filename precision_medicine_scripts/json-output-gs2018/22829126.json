Here, we describe a novel multiplex assay system based on the proven TaqMan and Armored RNA technologies and optimized for sensitive detection of three BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts and ABL1 in a single reaction. Analytical experiments confirmed the absence of significant competition between the simultaneous amplification reactions and established the sensitivity, linearity and precision of the assay. Comparative studies with 115 clinical specimens resulted in high qualitative and quantitative agreement with independent singleplex laboratory-developed tests routinely used in clinical testing. Direct comparison with a reference laboratory calibrated to the international scale (IS) demonstrated minimal analytical bias between methods and an overall accuracy and precision within the performance range required for quantitative measurement of BCR-ABL1 on the IS. We conclude that detection of e1a2, b2a2, b3a2 and ABL1 can be achieved in a multiplex assay format compatible with IS reporting. Further clinical validation of the assay could improve the operational efficiency of clinical laboratories, increase their adherence to current recommendations for b2a2/b3a2 reporting on the IS and provide for the first time an opportunity to standardize e1a2-monitoring results.","title":"Establishment of a standardized multiplex assay with the analytical performance required for quantitative measurement of BCR-ABL1 on the international reporting scale.","pubmedId":"22829126"}
