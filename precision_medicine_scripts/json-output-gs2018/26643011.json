Since IDC-P, unlike PIN, was strongly correlated with aggressive prostate cancer, differentiation of these is too necessary. So we evaluated immunohistopathological patterns and the prognostic factors of IDC-P and HGPIN, in radical prostatectomy samples.\nWe evaluated 250 radical prostatectomy and detected 210 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma without IDC-P foci, 40 cases with adenocarcinoma concomitant IDC-P, and 40 cases HGPIN; therefore, we evaluated immunohistopathological criteria in these groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS and P-value \u003c0.05 was considered as the statistical significant level.\nPSA level was significantly higher in IDC-P compared with non-IDC-P patients (15.7 ± 3.1 vs. 10.2 ± 4.3, P \u003d 0.041). All pathological and morphologic features, also invasions factors were higher in IDC-P compared to non-IDC-P groups (P \u003c 0.001). P63 was positive expressed in all IDC-P and HGPIN specimen. PTEN protein was diffusely expressed in the cytoplasm of all HGPIN but in 4 (11.1%) of IDC-P. PTEN and P63 were negative in adenocarcinoma foci.\nWe found that IDC-P had a unique histoclinical feature and was strongly associated with poor prognostic factors. Diagnosis and report of IDC-P should be considered in all prostate specimens. Also, we recommend PTEN IHC application for differentiated IDC-P from HGPIN in biopsies.","title":"Histopathological features of intra-ductal carcinoma of prostatic and high grade prostatic intraepithelialneoplasia and correlation with PTEN and P63.","pubmedId":"26643011"}
