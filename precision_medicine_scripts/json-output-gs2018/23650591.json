An increased BRAF copy number was found in 18/47 primary samples tested; 15 of them (83.3%) were pilocytic astrocytomas. A BRAF mutation was found in 3/48 primary tumors, all with a normal BRAF copy number and no GNAQ mutation. One sample had a GNAQ209 mutation (Q209P626) with a normal BRAF gene; none of the tumors had a GNA11Q209 mutation. Recurrent or progressive tumors, analyzed in four patients, had the same molecular genotype as their primary. Increased BRAF copy number and activating BRAF mutations may be involved in the development of low-grade glioma via overactivation of the Ras/Raf pathway. This is the first report of a mutation in GNAQ209 in pediatric low-grade glioma. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma initiation and growth may assist in the development of targeted therapies.","title":"BRAF, GNAQ, and GNA11 mutations and copy number in pediatric low-grade glioma.","pubmedId":"23650591"}
