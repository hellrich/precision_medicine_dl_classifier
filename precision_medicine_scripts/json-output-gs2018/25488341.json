Black patients were less likely to present with oral cavity cancer, and more likely to present with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers. White patients were more likely to have early stage disease, especially in the oral cavity. Black race was independently associated with worse overall survival (OS) in the entire cohort. Black patients had a significantly worse OS among oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers, with the largest disparity in oropharyngeal cancer. However, in multivariate analysis, race was only still significant in oropharyngeal cancer.\nWe observed differences by race in distribution of disease site, stage, and OS. Survival disparity in the entire cohort was driven mostly by differences among oropharyngeal cancer.","title":"Oropharyngeal cancer as a driver of racial outcome disparities in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: 10-year experience at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center.","pubmedId":"25488341"}
