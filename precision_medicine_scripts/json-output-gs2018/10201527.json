In cultured keratinocytes activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor upregulates expression of Bcl-x(L), an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homolog. The functional contribution of epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent Bcl-x(L) expression to keratinocyte survival is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity with either an epidermal growth factor receptor antagonistic monoclonal antibody (MoAb 425) or an epidermal growth factor receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (AG 1478) downregulated Bcl-x(L) expression in normal human keratinocytes but had no effect on expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologs Bad, Bak, and Bax. Bovine pituitary extract and insulin partially alleviated both, downregulation of Bcl-x(L) expression and cell death upon epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition. Forced expression of Bcl-x(L) attenuated cell death of immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) induced by either forced suspension (anoikis) or by epidermal growth factor receptor blockade. These results demonstrate that epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent signaling pathways control the balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members expressed in normal keratinocytes. Inappropriate survival supported by aberrant signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor may contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis and of squamous cell carcinomas.","title":"A central role of Bcl-X(L) in the regulation of keratinocyte survival by autocrine EGFR ligands.","pubmedId":"10201527"}
