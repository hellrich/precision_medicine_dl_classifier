Various immunotherapeutic approaches for melanoma have been developed in the past decades. Recent scientific progress includes the discovery of defined melanoma antigens, new tools for monitoring of an anti-cancer immune response and application of novel adjuvants for amplification of the immune response such as dendritic cells. These and other advances in the field of melanoma vaccines will be discussed.","title":"Vaccines and melanoma.","pubmedId":"12464156"}
