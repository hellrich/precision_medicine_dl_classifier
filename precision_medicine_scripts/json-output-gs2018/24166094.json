Currently, most patients with relapsed neuro-blastoma die of disease and present a major challenge for treatment. New therapeutic options are urgently needed to improve patient survival. Activating mutations in the gene encoding the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) remain the most frequent druggable mutations identified in neuroblastomas to date. Preclinical data support an oncogene addiction of neuroblastoma cells to mutated ALK and demonstrate that ALK inhibitory therapy strongly combats tumor models. Most recently, pediatric phase I testing has been completed for the first approved ALK inhibitor, Crizotinib, showing very encouraging antitumoral results in neuroblastoma patients. Subsequently, an international phase I study with the second generation ALK inhibitor, LDK-378, will be launched that makes ALK inhibitory therapy also available to pediatric patients in Germany.
