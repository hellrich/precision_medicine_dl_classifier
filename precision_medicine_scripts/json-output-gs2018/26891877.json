Because FLT3-N676K was encountered almost exclusively in inv(16) AML, we investigated the transforming potential of FLT3-N676K, the cooperation between FLT3-N676K and core binding factor ß-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (CBFß-SMMHC) (encoded by the inv(16) chimeric gene CBFB-MYH11) in inducing acute leukemia, and tested the sensitivity of FLT3-N676K-positive leukemic cells to FLT3 inhibitors. Retroviral expression of FLT3-N676K in myeloid 32D cells induced AML in syngeneic C3H/HeJ mice (n \u003d 11/13, median latency 58 days), with a transforming activity similar to FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) (n \u003d 8/8), FLT3-TKD D835Y (n \u003d 8/9), and FLT3-ITD-N676K (n \u003d 9/9) mutations. Three out of 14 (21.4 %) C57BL/6J mice transplanted with FLT3-N676K-transduced primary hematopoietic progenitor cells developed acute leukemia (latency of 68, 77, and 273 days), while no hematological malignancy was observed in the control groups including FLT3-ITD. Moreover, co-expression of FLT3-N676K/CBFß-SMMHC did not promote acute leukemia in three independent experiments (n \u003d 16). In comparison with FLT3-ITD, FLT3-N676K induced much higher activation of FLT3 and tended to trigger stronger phosphorylation of MAPK and AKT. Importantly, leukemic cells carrying the FLT3-N676K mutant in the absence of an ITD mutation were highly sensitive to FLT3 inhibitors AC220 and crenolanib, and crenolanib even retained activity against the AC220-resistant FLT3-ITD-N676K mutant. Taken together, the FLT3-N676K mutant is potent to transform murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in vivo. This is the first report of acute leukemia induced by an activating FLT3 mutation in C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, further experiments investigating molecular mechanisms for leukemogenesis induced by FLT3-N676K mutation and clinical evaluation of FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-N676K-positive AML seem warranted.","title":"Leukemogenic potency of the novel FLT3-N676K mutant.","pubmedId":"26891877"}
