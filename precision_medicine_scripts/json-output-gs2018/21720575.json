In children, melanoma is distinctly uncommon, and metastatic disease occurs even more seldom. This case report, the first of a patellar lesion as the initial presentation of metastatic melanoma in a pediatric patient, highlights use of patellectomy and intraoperative radiation therapy in obtaining palliative local control while avoiding periarticular functional morbidity.","title":"Patellar metastatic melanoma in a 13-year-old boy.","pubmedId":"21720575"}
