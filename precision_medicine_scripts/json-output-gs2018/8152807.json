Mutations have been found predominantly in conserved regions two to five. Our aim was to analyse p53 at the protein and DNA level in seven melanoma cell lines of cutaneous origin (HMB-2, DX3, LT5.1, MJM, SK23, A375P and A375M), including two parental/metastatic derivatives (A375P and A375M; DX3 and LT5.1). By immunohistochemical staining with three mouse monoclonal antibodies and a rabbit polyclonal serum, it was possible to observe differential nuclear expression of p53. The quantitation of p53 protein levels by ELISA correlated with the nuclear staining pattern. Western blotting showed an intact p53 protein in all cell lines; p53 was polymorphic in three cell lines (MJM, A375P and A375M). DNA sequencing studies showed that all cell lines had wild type p53. These results suggest that p53 is unlikely to play a significant role in the genesis of cutaneous melanoma.","title":"Analysis of p53 in human cutaneous melanoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"8152807"}
