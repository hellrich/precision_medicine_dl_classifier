Since knowledge about the regulation of death receptor sensitivity in melanoma is sparse, we have analysed these signaling pathways in detail. The loss of CD95 or TRAIL-R1, but not of TRAIL-R2, surface expression correlated with apoptosis sensitivity in a panel of melanoma cell lines. In contrast, the expression of proteins of the apical apoptosis signaling cascade (FADD, initiator caspases-8 and cFLIP) did not predict apoptosis sensitivity. Since both TRAIL-R1 and -R2 transmit apoptotic signals, we asked whether cFLIP, highly expressed in several of the cell lines tested, is sufficient to maintain resistance to TRAIL-R2-mediated apoptosis. Downregulation of cFLIP in TRAIL-R2-positive, TRAIL-resistant IGR cells dramatically increased TRAIL sensitivity. Conversely ectopic expression of cFLIP in TRAIL-sensitive, TRAIL-R2-expressing RPM-EP melanoma cells inhibited TRAIL- and CD95L-mediated cell death. Thus, modulation of cFLIP is sufficient to sensitize TRAIL-R2-expressing cells for TRAIL. Taken together, albeit expressing all proteins necessary for death receptor-mediated apoptosis, TRAIL-R1 negative melanoma cells cannot undergo TRAIL- or CD95L-induced apoptosis due to expression of cFLIP. Hence, cFLIP represents an attractive therapeutic target for melanoma treatment, especially in combination with TRAIL receptor agonists.","title":"Suppression of cFLIP is sufficient to sensitize human melanoma cells to TRAIL- and CD95L-mediated apoptosis.","pubmedId":"18084329"}
