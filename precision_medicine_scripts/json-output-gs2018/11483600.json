Min/+ mice develop adenomas that exhibit loss of the wild-type Apc allele (Apc(Min/-)). Previously, we found that histologically normal enterocytes bearing a truncated Apc protein (Apc(Min/+)) migrated more slowly in vivo than enterocytes with either wild-type Apc (Apc(+/+)) or with heterozygous loss of Apc protein (Apc(1638N)). To study this phenotype further, we determined the effect of the Apc(Min) mutation upon cell-cell adhesion by examining the components of the adherens junction (AJ). We observed a reduced association between E-cadherin and beta-catenin in Apc(Min/+) enterocytes. Subcellular fractionation of proteins from Apc(+/+), Apc(Min/+), and Apc(Min/-) intestinal tissues revealed a cytoplasmic localization of intact E-cadherin only in Apc(Min/+), suggesting E-cadherin internalization in these enterocytes. beta-Catenin tyrosine phosphorylation was also increased in Apc(Min/+) enterocytes, consistent with its dissociation from E-cadherin. Furthermore, Apc(Min/+) enterocytes showed a decreased association between beta-catenin and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta (RPTPbeta/zeta), and Apc(Min/-) cells demonstrated an association between beta-catenin and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase gamma. In contrast to the Apc(Min/+) enterocytes, Apc(Min/-) adenomas displayed increased expression and association of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and alpha-catenin relative to Apc(+/+) controls. These data show that Apc plays a role in regulating adherens junction structure and function in the intestine. In addition, discovery of these effects in initiated but histologically normal tissue (Apc(Min/+)) defines a pre-adenoma stage of tumorigenesis in the intestinal mucosa.","title":"Progressive changes in adherens junction structure during intestinal adenoma formation in Apc mutant mice.","pubmedId":"11483600"}
