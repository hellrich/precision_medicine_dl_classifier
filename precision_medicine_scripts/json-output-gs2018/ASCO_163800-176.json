Methods: FFPE samples from 84 cases of BC, 71 ductal (IDC) and 13 lobular (ILC), were immunostained (IHC) using rabbit monoclonal PD-L1/CD274 (SP142). Membranous PD-L1 staining was scored as negative, low positive (1  24%) and high positive ( \u003d or \u003e 25%) for both tumor cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was used to measure PD-L1gene amplification and total TMB, calculated by counting mutations across a 1.25Mb region spanning 315 genes. TMB was also calculated for a separate cohort of 6,751 metastatic BC (mBC). Results: PD-L1 immunoreactivity was noted as low positive in 4/84 (5%) BC [2 tumor+/TIL+ and 2 tumor+/TIL-], and as low positive in the TIL component for 5 (6%) additional BC [tumor-/TIL+]; all 9 (100%) were IDCs. No PD-L1 immunoreactivity was noted in the TIL component of the remaining cases, despite the presence of prominent TILs in most cases. PD-L1 protein expression correlated with decreased overall survival (OS) [100% PD-L1+ cases and 0% tumor-/TIL+ cases expired, (p \u003d 0.002)], while showing a trend toward correlation with tumors that did not recur [100% PD-L1+ cases and 100% tumor-/TIL+ did not recur, (p \u003d 0.08)] and age at diagnosis in the ER+ subgroup [100% PD-L1+ cases diagnosed at a peri-menopausal age and 100% tumor-/TIL+ cases diagnosed at a post-menopausal age, (p \u003d 0.069)]. On multivariate analysis, tumor grade (p \u003d 0.025) and disease recurrence independently predicted OS. PD-L1gene amplification was identified in only 57 (0.1%) of 6,751 mBC. High TMB, defined as greater than the top quartile across all indications, was found in 1,351 of 6,643 (20%) mBC cases. Conclusions: PD-L1 expression is found in both cancer cells and TILs and is a significant adverse prognostic factor in BC. PD-L1 amplification is extremely uncommon, whereas high TMB was found in 20% of mBC. The potential for these biomarkers to identify BC patients as candidates for immunotherapy warrants further study.","title":"Biomarkers of immune checkpoint inhibitor response in metastatic breast cancer: PD-L1 protein expression, CD274 gene amplification, and total mutational burden.","pubmedId":"ASCO_163800-176"}
