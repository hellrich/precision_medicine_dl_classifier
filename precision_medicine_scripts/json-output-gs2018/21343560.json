In a subset of cases (n \u003d 269), microarray gene expression analysis was performed.\nFifty-nine RUNX1 mutations were identified in 53 (5.6%) of 945 cases, predominantly in exons 3 (n \u003d 11), 4 (n \u003d 10), and 8 (n \u003d 23). RUNX1 mutations clustered in the intermediate-risk cytogenetic group (46 of 640, 7.2%; cytogenetically normal, 34 of 538, 6.3%), whereas they were less frequent in adverse-risk cytogenetics (five of 109, 4.6%) and absent in core-binding-factor AML (0 of 77) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (0 of 61). RUNX1 mutations were associated with MLL-partial tandem duplications (P \u003d .0007) and IDH1/IDH2 mutations (P \u003d .03), inversely correlated with NPM1 (P \u003c .0001), and in trend with CEBPA (P \u003d .10) mutations. RUNX1 mutations were characterized by a distinct gene expression pattern; this RUNX1 mutation-derived signature was not exclusive for the mutation, but also included mostly adverse-risk AML [eg, 7q-, -7, inv(3), or t(3;3)]. RUNX1 mutations predicted for resistance to chemotherapy (rates of refractory disease 30% and 19%, P \u003d .047, for RUNX1-mutated and wild-type patients, respectively), as well as inferior event-free survival (EFS; P \u003c .0001), relapse-free survival (RFS, P \u003d .022), and overall survival (P \u003d .051). In multivariable analysis, RUNX1 mutations were an independent prognostic marker for shorter EFS (P \u003d .007). Explorative subgroup analysis revealed that allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation had a favorable impact on RFS in RUNX1-mutated patients (P \u003c .0001).\nAML with RUNX1 mutations are characterized by distinct genetic properties and are associated with resistance to therapy and inferior outcome.","title":"RUNX1 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia: results from a comprehensive genetic and clinical analysis from the AML study group.","pubmedId":"21343560"}
