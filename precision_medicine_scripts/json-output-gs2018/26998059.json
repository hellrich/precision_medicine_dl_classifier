To aid with the selection of the most appropriate therapy, biomarkers have become a specific research focus. Sec62 is involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress tolerance and cell migration, and has been identified as a novel prognostic marker for non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, Sec62 may be a promising candidate in HNSCC. Pretreatment biopsies of 35 patients with locally advanced HNSCC, who were treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy without prior surgery, were examined for the expression of Sec62 protein, as well as the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p16 and survivin proteins. Immunohistological results were correlated with patient overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) times. In the present patient cohort, 12/35 cases (34%) demonstrated strong and 8/35 cases (23%) moderate Sec62 staining intensity. Additionally, in 11/35 cases (31%), weak staining was observed, and only 4/35 cases (11%) were Sec62-negative. Notably, a high Sec62 protein level was associated with a significantly poorer OS and PFS (P\u003d0.020 and P\u003d0.028, respectively). Furthermore, higher nuclear survivin expression showed a weak trend for poorer OS rate (P\u003d0.079), whilst neither cytoplasmic survivin, EGFR nor p16 influenced OS or PFS significantly. The present study indicated that Sec62 is a promising prognostic marker for HNSCC. Increased Sec62 protein expression may indicate a poorer prognosis in advanced HNSCC. As the present study was focused on patients treated by chemoradiation therapy, further studies with larger patient cohorts and alternative treatment approaches are required in order to define the prognostic value of Sec62 in HNSCC.","title":"Initial evidence for Sec62 as a prognostic marker in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26998059"}
