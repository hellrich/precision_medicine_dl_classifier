Selumetinib (AZD6244) is an oral, selective, non-ATP-competitive inhibitor of MEK1/2. Here, we describe a patient with metastatic melanoma (T1N2cM1a) with a BRAF V600E mutation. She is currently being treated with selumetinib 75 mg twice daily in a phase I trial and has shown complete response for the past 4 years. This case report raises questions regarding treatment schedule, treatment duration and management of adverse events.","title":"A prolonged complete response in a patient with BRAF-mutated melanoma stage IV treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244).","pubmedId":"22293660"}
