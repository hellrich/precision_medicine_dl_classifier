Selected cases were also investigated for increased KIT gene copy number by fluorescent in situ hybridisation.\nFunctional KIT mutations were demonstrated in 11/31 (35.5%) of AR melanomas and in 1/26 (3.8%) of GI melanoma metastases (p\u003d0.004). A significant difference emerged between primary and metastatic MM with regards to KIT-positive immunostaining (p\u003d0.002). Immunohistochemical c-KIT protein overexpression did not correlate with KIT mutational status. Increased KIT copy number was demonstrated in 5/20 AR primary cases.\nThe rate of functional mutations in KIT is significantly higher in AR MM than in GI metastatic melanoma. KIT protein overexpression does not correlate with KIT mutations and cannot be used for screening purposes. Recognising the molecular heterogeneity of MM helps to identify patients who require a different therapeutic approach.","title":"KIT genetic alterations in anorectal melanomas.","pubmedId":"25398993"}
