We established University of Michigan-squamous cell carcinoma-104 (UM-SCC-104), a new HPV(+) HNSCC cell line from a recurrent oral cavity tumor, and characterized it for the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs).\nTumor cells were tested for biomarker expression by immunohistology, and the presence of HPV was assessed by several methods.\nUM-SCC-104 has a unique genotype, contains HPV-16, and expresses E6/E7. Inoculation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)(+) and ALDH(-) cells in an immunocompromised mouse resulted in tumor growth from the ALDH(+) cells after 6 weeks that recapitulated the histology of the primary, whereas ALDH(-) cells did not produce tumors.\nUM-SCC-104, a new HPV-16, CSC-containing HNSCC cell line will aid in studying recurrent HPV(+) tumors. The aggressive nature of this tumor is consistent with high uniform expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and a functionally significant proportion of ALDH(+) CSCs.","title":"UM-SCC-104: a new human papillomavirus-16-positive cancer stem cell-containing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line.","pubmedId":"22162267"}
