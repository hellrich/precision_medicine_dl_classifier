However, the definition of suboptimal response remains under discussion.\nWe used conventional cytogenetics for the detection of clonal changes in Ph-positive and negative clones. RT-PCR and sequencing were carried out on peripheral blood leukocytes to detect the type of BCR-ABL1 transcript. The BCR-ABL1 mutational status was assessed using sequencing of RT-PCR products. High performance capillary electrophoresis for determination of imatinib (IMA) plasma concentration was used.\nA retrospective study of 110 patients diagnosed with chronic-phase (CP) CML treated with IMA or 2(nd) generation TKIs in the years 2000-2009 focused on analysis of patients with suboptimal response according to ELN criteria. 40 patients were administered IMA as first-line therapy and 70 had been pretreated with interferon-alpha (IFN-α) with or without Ara-C and/or hydroxyurea (HU) for a median 12 months (range, 1-92 months). After adjusting for the ELN criteria, major molecular response (MMR) was achieved after median 34 and 39 months in 66.7% and 41.7% of patients after the first and second-line IMA therapy with suboptimal response defined as lack of achievement of MMR at the 18(th) month of treatment, respectively. In comparison to patients with optimal response, patients with suboptimal response did not show significant differences in overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS). Cytogenetic assays demonstrated additional chromosome abnormalities (ACAs): chromosome 8 trisomy in a Ph-negative clone during the IMA treatment (in 1 case) and der(9q) in Ph-positive clone (in 2 cases); in patients receiving first-line IMA only chromosome 8 trisomy was observed which was associated with myelodysplastic syndrome - this was the only case where hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed. During the treatment with IMA in both subgroups no regulatory mutations in the ABL kinase domain were confirmed.\nWe believe that the category of suboptimal response should be redefined or withdrawn from the ELN 2009 recommendations for management of CML patients treated with TKIs. Patients with suboptimal response who have no additional risks (additional cytogenetic abnormalities or BCR-ABL1 regulatory mutations) may remain on IMA treatment while patients with these risks should be switched to the 2(nd) generation TKIs.","title":"A significant proportion of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and suboptimal response according to European Leukemia Net criteria have excellent prognosis without treatment change.","pubmedId":"22660209"}
