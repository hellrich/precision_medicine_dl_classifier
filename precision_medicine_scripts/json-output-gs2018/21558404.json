Cohort B consisted of 50 patients with WHO grade II gliomas who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy at diagnosis. Tumors were analyzed for TP53 mutations, 1p/19q codeletions, MGMT promoter methylation, and IDH1 mutations.\nMedian progression-free survival (PFS) in cohort A was 4.1 years (95% CI: 3.1-5.1). No molecular marker was prognostic for PFS after surgery alone, using multivariate adjustment for histology, age, and extent of resection. IDH1 mutations were associated with prolonged survival from the diagnosis of PD in oligoastrocytomas (OA II)/oligodendrogliomas (O II) and with overall survival (OS) in all tumors. 1p/19q codeletion and IDH1 mutation were prognostic for PFS and OS in cohort B.\nNone of the parameters are sensitive prognostic biomarkers in WHO grade II glioma patients who do not receive radiotherapy or chemotherapy after surgery. Limitations of this study include the selection of patients with favorable outcome, the nonrandomized allocation of treatment, and the insufficient sample size to distinguish between effects of radiotherapy versus chemotherapy. Regardless of histology, IDH1 mutation status is the strongest prognostic marker for OS.","title":"Molecular markers in low-grade gliomas: predictive or prognostic?","pubmedId":"21558404"}
