The clinical pathological diagnosis of epithelioma basocellular is confirmed. In both patients, numerous pits on the hands and feet are shown without noticeable subjective symptoms; one of the biopsies reveals a carcinoma of basal cells in the epidermis underlying the pit. A detailed study is carried out on both families with the existence of different osseous anomalies, without finding cutaneous stigmas. The treatments carried out are checked bringing in our experience with the locally applied 5-FU. It is clearly obvious that UV light is a key factor in these two cases.","title":"[Basal cell nevus syndrome. Apropos of 2 new cases].","pubmedId":"3543556"}
