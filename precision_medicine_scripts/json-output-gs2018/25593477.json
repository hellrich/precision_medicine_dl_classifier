The clinicopathologic factors and molecular markers were assessed as predictors for lymph node metastasis. Molecular markers such as microsatellite instability, human mutL homolog 1, p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. The χ(2) test and logistic regression analysis were used to determine clinicopathologic parameters.\nLymph node metastasis was observed in 104 (9.4%) of 1104 patients. Among 104 cases of lymph node positive patients, 24 patients (3.8%) were mucosal cancers and 80 patients (16.7%) were submucosal. According to histologic evaluation, the number of lymph node metastasis found was 4 (1.7%) for well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, 45 (11.3%) for moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, 36 (14.8%) for poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, and 19 (8.4%) for signet ring cell carcinoma. Of 690 EGC cases, 77 cases (11.2%) showed EGFR overexpression. HER2 overexpression was present in 110 cases (27.1%) of 406 EGC patients. With multivariate analysis, female gender (OR \u003d 2.281, P \u003d 0.009), presence of lymphovascular invasion (OR \u003d 10.950, P \u003c 0.0001), diameter (≥ 20 mm, OR \u003d 3.173, P \u003d 0.01), and EGFR overexpression (OR \u003d 2.185, P \u003d 0.044) were independent risk factors for lymph node involvement.\nFemale gender, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion and EGFR overexpression were predictive risk factors for lymph node metastasis in EGC.","title":"Clinicopathologic factors and molecular markers related to lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"25593477"}
