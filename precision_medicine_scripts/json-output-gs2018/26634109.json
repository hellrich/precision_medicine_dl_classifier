Overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) of the patients, and their relation with demographic and clinico-pathological factors have been analyzed.\nAmong 119 included patients, 90 were male and 29 were female with mean age of 58 years. Larynx was the most common primary tumor site (55% of all patients). With a median follow-up period of 28 months, OS and EFS of the study patients was 61.2% and 52.4%, respectively. Tumor stage was the only parameter has significantly influenced the patients\u0027 OS. Patients with normal BMIs had significantly higher mean EFS compared with patients with bellow or above normal BMIs. Surgical treatment modalities have resulted in the same prognosis as non-surgical approaches.\nOur study seems to be the first that investigated outcome of Iranian patients with head and neck cancer and its influencing factors.","title":"Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Iran: Clinico-Pathological and Treatment-Related Factors Influencing Survival.","pubmedId":"26634109"}
