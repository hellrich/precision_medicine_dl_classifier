Reports of the resistance of the kinase domain mutation D816V to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate prompted us to characterize 14 c-KIT mutations reported in association with human hematologic malignancies for transforming activity in the murine hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 and for sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKC412. Ten of 14 c-KIT mutations conferred interleukin 3 (IL-3)-independent growth. c-KIT D816Y and D816V transformed cells were sensitive to PKC412 despite resistance to imatinib mesylate. In these cells, PKC412, but not imatinib mesylate, inhibited autophosphorylation of c-KIT and activation of downstream effectors signal transducer and transcriptional activator 5 (Stat5) and Stat3. Variable sensitivities to PKC412 or imatinib mesylate were observed among other mutants. These findings suggest that PKC412 may be a useful therapeutic agent for c-KIT-positive malignancies harboring the imatinib mesylate-resistant D816V or D816Y activation mutations.","title":"Activation mutations of human c-KIT resistant to imatinib mesylate are sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKC412.","pubmedId":"15790786"}
