Culture of CMCs has enabled us to perform drug sensitivity testing on them. The main hypothesis was to compare drug sensitivity of primary tumor cells grown in culture with the sensitivity of CMCs grown in vitro after capture. B16 murine melanoma was implanted i.p. in mice. Fourteen days after peritoneal injection, mice were sacrificed and blood obtained by cardiac puncture for CMCs-capture. The CMCs were captured either by immunomagnetic separation (Adnagen, AdnaTest Melanoma Select, Germany) and/or blood added to culture flask containing growing medium. Sensitivity to cisplatin (CDDP) was tested with the MTT-assay at different concentrations. Primary melanoma and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) were also cultured and tested. The DTCs were isolated from peritoneal washing (ascites like cells), lymph nodes and peritoneal fat tissue. CMCs and DTCs were found less sensitive to CDDP than primary melanoma cells. The ability to capture and culture CTCs enabled these studies which can be used for individualized therapy design.","title":"Characterization of cultured circulating melanoma cells for individualized therapy","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2680"}
