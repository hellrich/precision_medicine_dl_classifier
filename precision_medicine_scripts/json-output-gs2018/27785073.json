Here, the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and costimulatory molecule B7-H3, both of which have been implicated in tumor onset and progression in certain tumors, was investigated in relation to the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of patients with ESCC. ESCC tissue samples were analyzed for 100 patients. Tumor and patient characteristics were recorded. Tissues were investigated for EGFR and B7-H3 staining by immunohistochemistry. Patients were followed for up to 96 months to determine overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). High expression for EGFR (68.0%) and B7-H3 (66.0%) was observed in the majority of cases. High expression of either EGFR or B7-H3 was correlated with tumor invasion depth and clinical stage (P\u003c0.05). Further, high expression of either EGFR or B7-H3 was correlated with worse survival outcomes. The estimated OS (38.1 months) and PFS (13.4 months) of patients with high expression of EGFR were lower than those of patients with low expression (69.3 and 68.1 months, P\u003c0.05). The estimated OS (31.1 months) and PFS (13.1 months) of patients with high expression of B7-H3 were also lower than those of patients with low expression (69.3 and 66.6 months, P\u003c0.05). Indeed, Cox multiple regression showed that OS and PFS were correlated with EGFR (relative risk \u003d1.853, 1.875, respectively) and B7-H3 (relative risk \u003d1.886, 2.061, respectively) (all P\u003c0.05) expression level. Thus, EGFR and B7-H3 are highly expressed in tumor tissues of patients with ESCC. Their expression levels are correlated with tumor severity and survival, and therefore these may be viable biomarkers to aid in prognosis determination.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor and B7-H3 expression in esophageal squamous tissues correlate to patient prognosis.","pubmedId":"27785073"}
