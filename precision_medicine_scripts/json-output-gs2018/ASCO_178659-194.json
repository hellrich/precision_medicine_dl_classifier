In addition, tumor-associated PD-L1 has been proposed as a predictor of response to anti-PD-1 therapy, although responses are observed in some cases of PD-L1 negative MM. We hypothesize that tumor-derived PD-L1 has additional systemic effects through the release of biologically active soluble forms of PD-L1 (sPD-L1) into the circulation, which further impedes the anti-tumor immune response and contributes to poor clinical outcomes in MM. Methods: We developed a sPD-L1 ELISA and biochemically confirmed the identity of the detected protein. We measured the levels of sPD-L1 in 276 patients with MM enrolled on 3 clinical trials who had stored pre-treatment plasma samples and 37 healthy volunteers (HV) undergoing blood donation at Mayo Clinic. We also measured sPD-L1 in baseline samples from 38 MM patients treated with anti-PD1 (pembrolizumab) 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. ROC analysis was used to compute sPD-L1 concentration cut-off value and Wald test was used to asses the difference of overall survival (OS) in patients with low versus high sPD-L1 concentration. Results: We found that sPD-L1 levels were significantly elevated in MM patients compared with HV (p\u003d0.0011). Mean sPD-L1 level in MM was 1.73 ng/mL (range: 0.13-18.29) compared with 0.77 ng/mL (range: 0.116.02) for HV. Patients with higher levels (\u003e0.293 ng/mL) had a median OS of 11.3 months compared to 14.8 months for patients with sPD-L1 level  0.293 ng/mL (p\u003d0.040). Similarly to tumor-related PD-L1 findings, patients who had clinical benefit (OR/PR/SD) after 4 cycles of anti-PD1 had higher sPD-L1 levels at baseline (2.1 vs. 1.1 ng/mL). Conclusions: To our knowledge, our study is the first to report a correlation of sPD-L1 with MM patient outcome, although a larger study is needed to establish the utility of sPD-L1 as an independent prognostic and possibly predictive biomarker.","title":"Association of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) with decreased survival in metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_178659-194"}
