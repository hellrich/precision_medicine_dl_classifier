The cuff was to be put on the upper arm with 20 devices, on the wrist with five devices and on the left index finger with two devices. Per device and test person, six sequential comparative measurements were carried out using automated self-measurement and standard method with a double stethoscope in the same arm.\nOn average, the devices measured the systolic pressure between 13.2 mmHg lower and 3.5 mmHg higher than the standard procedure; the diastolic pressure was measured between 17.4 and 0.2 mmHg lower. Using a scoring system, in which a device only got points for a comparative measurement if the differences to the control in systolic and diastolic measurement both were \u003c or \u003d 10 mmHg, the devices gained between 67 and 259 out of a maximum of 576 points. If each of the test persons had opted to buy just those devices which revealed a mean systolic and diastolic error of \u003c or \u003d 5 mmHg in his or her case, younger test persons would have found zero to five suitable devices older persons three to 13. The site of cuff application had no significant influence on results.\nStandard measurements and measurements with automated blood pressure self-measurement devices can differ considerably. In young test persons less suitable instruments are found than for older persons.","title":"Devices for blood pressure self measurement: tested in comparison.","pubmedId":"8896295"}
