Here we describe a PD-L1 immunohistochemical (IHC) diagnostic test developed by Ventana Medical Systems for use with MEDI4736.  Methods:  An anti-human PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (SP263) was optimized for use with Ventana OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit on the automated BenchMark ULTRA platform. The PD-L1 IHC assay was validated for use in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of NSCLC and SCCHN in a series of studies addressing sensitivity, specificity, robustness, and precision. MEDI4736 is a human IgG1 mAb that blocks PD-L1 binding to PD-1 and CD80 with high affinity and selectivity. A subset of clinical trial samples from a Phase 1/2 study of MEDI4736 (NCT01693562) was analyzed to determine optimal cut-off for enriching response to MEDI4736. Inter-reader precision was established by 3 pathologists who evaluated 81 NSCLC and 100 SCCHN samples across the range of expression levels. Results:  The Ventana PD-L1 IHC (SP263) assay met all pre-defined acceptance criteria. The scoring algorithm was defined using statistical analysis of clinical response data and PD-L1 staining parameters observed in a set of NCT01693562 clinical trial samples. Samples of both cancer types are considered test positive when the membrane of   25% of tumor cells stain for PD-L1 at any intensity. Inter-reader precision in determining PD-L1 status resulted in an overall percentage agreement of 97% and 92% for NSCLC and SCCHN, respectively. For both NSCLC and SCCHN, PD-L1+ patients identified by the scoring algorithm had a higher response rate than PD-L1- patients. Conclusions:  These results highlight the robustness and reproducibility of the PD-L1 IHC (SP263) assay in a clinical setting. In NSCLC and SCCHN patients treated with MEDI4736, PD-L1+ patients identified by the scoring algorithm had a higher response rate than PD-L1- patients. The clinical utility of the PD-L1 diagnostic assay will be further validated in a prospective manner using additional patients in this study and in other MEDI4736 studies.
