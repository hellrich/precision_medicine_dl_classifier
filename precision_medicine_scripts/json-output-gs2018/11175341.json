Activation of ErbB2 leads to breast cancer cell proliferation, presumably by inducing the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1,2 (Erk1,2) and Akt. We have previously reported that the growth factor receptor bound protein-2 (Grb2) is required for the proliferation of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. We investigated here whether Grb2 protein plays a role in heregulin-stimulated proliferation. Grb2 protein inhibition led to growth inhibition of heregulin-stimulated breast cancer cells, but not Erk1,2 inactivation. These findings are similar to our earlier observations in ErbB2-overexpressing cells. Since Akt can also be activated by heregulin, the effects of Grb2 inhibition on Akt were examined. Akt was inactivated following Grb2 downregulation in heregulin-stimulated breast cancer cells. We then examined the effects of Grb2 downregulation on Akt in ErbB2-overexpressing cells in the absence of heregulin. Similar to heregulin-stimulated cells, Grb2 inhibition also led to Akt inactivation in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Our results indicate that the activation of ErbB2 by heregulin or by its overexpression requires Grb2 to stimulate the Akt pathway to propagate mitogenic signals.","title":"Grb2 downregulation leads to Akt inactivation in heregulin-stimulated and ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.","pubmedId":"11175341"}
