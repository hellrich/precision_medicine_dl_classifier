ES/PNET of the uterus is rare. There are 43 cases published in the English literature as far as we know. We describe an additional case.\nA 56-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of irregular menopausal vaginal bleeding. After surgical excision, microscopic, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic examination suggested the diagnosis of ES/PNET. The patient underwent combined chemotherapy consisting of ifosfamide, etoposide, and cisplatin. She was alive with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis after 41 months of the initial operation.\nIn spite of the rarity of ES/PNET, we should consider it in the differential diagnosis of small cell neoplasms of the uterus.","title":"Ewing sarcoma-primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the uterus: a clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study of one case.","pubmedId":"20589387"}
