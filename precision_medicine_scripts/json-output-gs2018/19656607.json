The most common intrathoracic variants are synovial sarcoma, angiosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and sarcomatoid mesothelioma. Although thoracic Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) usually develops on the chest wall, there have been reports of primary Ewing sarcoma/PNET of the lung. We present the case of a 22-year-old woman with Ewing sarcoma/PNET diagnosed following histologic, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization studies of a bronchial biopsy specimen. Radiography, ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, and a bone marrow biopsy confirmed that the tumor was not metastatic. The patient was started on a chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, actinomycin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and etoposide and responded well. She is now being seen regularly at our outpatient clinic.","title":"[Pulmonary Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor: a case report and a review of the literature].","pubmedId":"19656607"}
