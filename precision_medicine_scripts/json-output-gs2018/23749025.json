Stomach cancer is the second most common cancer in Asia. Both these are one of the most common causes of cancer related death in the world.\nTo determine the mean time delay from appearance of the symptoms to the endoscope procedure [OGDS] and rationalized the reason for this delay in diagnosis.\nThis is a cross sectional study of stomach and esophageal cancer data from Jan 2004- July 2008. All patients\u0027 records of histologically confirmed stomach or esophageal cancers during the study period were reviewed.\nTotal of 112 consecutive patients with stomach and esophageal cancer were analysed. 86 cases of stomach and 26 cases of esophageal cancer were reviewed. The average age for stomach and esophageal cancers are 60.8 years and 58.4 years respectively. The mean duration from the first appearance of cancer symptoms to endoscope procedure was 32.4 weeks for stomach cancer patient and 16.7 weeks for esophageal cancer patients. The reasons for the delays are due to 1) self-medication, 2) Empirical treatment for dyspepsia using antacid and H2 antagonist, 3) Delay in endoscope procedure for high risk patients.\nReducing the delay in endoscope procedure may lead to early detection of cancer and thereby may improve the prognosis of these patients.","title":"Delay in Diagnosis of Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer: whose fault is it?","pubmedId":"23749025"}
