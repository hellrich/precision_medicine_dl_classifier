These tumours share architectural similarities with medullary thyroid carcinomas and exhibit nuclear features such as nuclear pseudoinclusions resembling papillary thyroid carcinoma. However, the clinical behaviour remains unclear. On the basis of their inconspicuous appearance and absence of invasion or recurrence during follow-up, the tumour was initially classified as an adenoma. Subsequently, molecular findings such as the detection of RET / PTC rearrangements in some hyalinizing trabecular tumours favoured the designation as a variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. However, miRNA profiling of hyalinizing trabecular tumours compared with benign thyroid lesions and papillary thyroid carcinoma failed to demonstrate the characteristic up-regulation found in papillary thyroid carcinoma. This article summarizes conventional diagnostic criteria with supplementary information regarding molecular pathogenesis of hyalinizing trabecular tumours of the thyroid.","title":"[Hyalinizing trabecular tumor of the thyroid.
