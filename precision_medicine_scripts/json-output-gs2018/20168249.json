The patient presented with a 3-month history of progressive right breast swelling and erythema. Clinically, inflammatory breast carcinoma was highly suspected. A tru-cut needle biopsy of the right breast demonstrated infiltration of tumoral cells around the breast lobules and soft tissue and also in angiolymphatic spaces. The immunohistochemical profile showed positivity for CD30 and ALK and confirmed the diagnosis of ALK-positive anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma of the breast.\nAnaplastic large T-cell lymphoma of the breast is rare, and can clinically mimic inflammatory breast carcinoma in adolescence.","title":"Primary ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma of the breast: a case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"20168249"}
