We analyzed data concerning 34 patients under 18 years of age prospectively registered in the French SFGM-TC database, who had undergone an allo-SCT for the treatment of ALK+ ALCL between 1993 and 2011. At transplant, 28 patients (82.4%) were in CR, whereas 6 exhibited detectable disease. Conditioning regimens were mostly myelo-ablative (n\u003d31). With a median follow-up of 6 years, 5-year overall and event-free survival rates were 70% (SE\u003d8%) and 58% (SE\u003d9%), respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse and treatment-related mortality was 18% (SE\u003d7%) and 24% (SE\u003d8%), respectively. Six patients had relapsed (median time, 141 days (35-235)). A durable CR had been obtained in 4/6 patients after injection of donor lymphocytes (n\u003d1) or vinblastine-corticosteroid therapy (n\u003d3). Ten patients had died, eight due to transplant toxicity and two due to progressive disease. Allo-SCT is an efficient treatment for pediatric patients with high-risk relapsed ALK+ ALCL. However, the overall morbidity of allo-SCT raises questions about its place, given the efficacy of targeted agents currently under development in this disease.
