Response rates for single-agent anti-PD-1 therapies are significantly higher in biomarker positive patients, therefore there is a need to utilize predictive diagnostics to enhance benefit-risk profiles and guide treatment decisions. To address this, we developed a novel quantitative multiplexed immunohistochemistry assay that provides objective quantitation of PD-L1 positive cells, but more importantly assesses interactions with immune cells (PD-1+ or CD8+) in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) clinical specimens. The clinical validity of this assay was verified in a small series of melanoma patients treated with anti-PD1 targeted therapies/agents.FFPE melanoma tissues from patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy were fluorescently stained with a combination of anti-PD-1, PD-L1, and S100 antibodies plus DAPI or a combination of anti-CD8, PD-L1, and S100 antibodies plus DAPI. Each slide was then imaged on Vectra platform and the frequencies of biomarker positive cells (PD-L1, PD-1, and CD8) and their interaction scores were objectively evaluated using proprietary Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA) algorithms. Analytical sensitivity, precision, and accuracy were established using standardized PD-L1 and PD-1 tissue control arrays composed of cell lines and lymphoid organs, while range of biomarker expression was verified on archived melanoma clinical specimens (n \u003d 30), including samples taken from melanoma patients prior to anti-PD-1 therapies (n \u003d 21).Frequencies of PD-L1 positive cells could be accurately quantified within 1% to 100% range in predefined control cell line mixtures. PD-L1 and PD-1 measurements were highly reproducible (R2 \u003d 0.98 and 0.97, respectively). A broad range of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression and interaction scores were observed in archival clinical specimens (n \u003d 53). In a cohort of 21 advanced melanoma patients treated with nivolumab (n \u003d 5) or pembrolizumab (n \u003d 16), the PD-1/L1 interaction score was found to reliably distinguish responders from non-responders (p \u003d 0.03) while PD-L1 alone (p \u003d 0.15) or CD-8 alone (p \u003d 0.23) did not. Additionally, patients exhibiting higher PD-1/L1 interaction scores had superior response rates (78% vs. 17%, p \u003d 0.03). Responders experienced significantly longer median progression-free survival (177 vs. 85 days, p \u003d 0.014), and fewer deaths (22% vs 58%) compared with patients having lower PD-1/L1 interaction scores.In terms of diagnostic utility, the PD-1/L1 multiplex test showed superior predictive power (78% Positive Predictive Value, 83% Negative Predictive Value) compared with PD-L1 expression alone. Additional studies are underway to fully establish diagnostic utility and aid in treatment guidance.","title":"Novel quantitative multiplexed PD-1/PD-L1 immunohistochemistry test provides superior prediction of treatment response in melanoma patients","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-853"}
