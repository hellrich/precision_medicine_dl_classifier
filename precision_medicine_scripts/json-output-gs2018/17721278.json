A consensus, however, has not yet been reached as to the optimal method of evaluating ErbB2 status. Immunohistochemistry to detect protein overexpression and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect ErbB2 gene amplification are the most frequently used methods. As no one detection method fulfills all necessary requirements of reliability, reproducibility, and ease of use, we developed a novel approach in the form of a simple assay we refer to as protein and gene double staining (PGDS) which simultaneously evaluates protein overexpression and gene amplification by combining immunohistochemistry with chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). A total of 134 invasive breast carcinomas, including 81 cases with a full-face section and 53 cases included in a tissue microarray (TMA), were assessed by PGDS, and the results were correlated with ErbB2 gene amplification status as determined by FISH. ErbB2 gene copy number determined by CISH analysis in the PGDS assay showed excellent concordance with that of FISH (correlation coefficient 0.82; P\u003c0.001 with full-face section cases, and 0.98; P\u003c0.001 with cases in a TMA). The overall concordance rate for gene amplification status between PGDS and FISH was 90.12% in cases with a full-face section and 92.45% with TMA cases. Perfect correlation was seen between the PGDS assay and FISH in cases that were considered either nonamplified or highly amplified by the dual assay. Of the 17 cases that showed low amplification by PGDS, 5 were classified as nonamplified by FISH. Correction for chromosome 17 copy number in the FISH assessment contributed to the discordance between CISH and FISH results. This newly developed PGDS method represents a novel approach to ErbB2 status determination that combines the assessment of both protein overexpression and gene amplification in one simple assay. It is likely that this assay will aid in immunohistochemical calibration and will also increase the sensitivity and specificity of ErbB2 testing.","title":"PGDS, a novel technique combining chromogenic in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for the assessment of ErbB2 (HER2/neu) status in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"17721278"}
