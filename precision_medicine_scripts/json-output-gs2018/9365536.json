Expression of the tyrosine-kinase receptor c-KIT progressively decreases during local tumor growth and invasion of human melanomas. To provide direct evidence that c-KIT plays a role in metastasis of human melanoma, we transfected the c-KIT gene into c-KIT-negative, highly metastatic human melanoma cells and subsequently analyzed their tumorigenic and metastatic potential in nude mice. Enforced c-KIT expression significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. Exposure of c-KIT-positive melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo to stem cell factor (SCF), the ligand for c-KIT, triggered apoptosis of these cells but not of normal melanocytes. These results suggest that the loss of c-KIT receptor may allow malignant melanoma cells to escape SCF/c-KIT-mediated apoptosis, thus contributing to tumor growth and eventually metastasis. The expression of c-KIT and other genes associated with malignant melanoma (such as MCAM/MUC18) is highly regulated by the transcription factor AP-2. The AP-2 protein is not expressed in malignant melanoma cells. Therefore, loss of AP-2 expression might be a crucial event in the progression of human melanoma.","title":"Molecular mechanisms of melanoma metastasis.","pubmedId":"9365536"}
