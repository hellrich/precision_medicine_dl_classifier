The 5-year survival rate for HR-NB remains below 40%, with the majority of patients suffering relapse from chemorefractory tumor. Immunotherapy is the main strategy against minimal residual disease and clinical experience has mostly focused on monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against the glycolipid disialoganglioside GD2. Three anti-GD2 antibodies have been tested in the clinic including murine 14G2a, human-mouse chimeric ch14.18 and 3F8. Anti-GD2 MoAb induces cellular cytoxicity against NB and is most effective when effector cells like natural killer cells, granulocytes and macrophages are amplified by cytokines. The combination of cytokines IL-2 and GM-CSF with the anti-GD2 MoAb ch14.18 (Dinutuximab) has shown a significant improvement in outcome for HR-NB. The FDA and EMA approved dinutuximab (Unituxin(R)) in 2015 for the treatment of patients with HR-NB who achieved at least a partial response after multimodality therapy.
