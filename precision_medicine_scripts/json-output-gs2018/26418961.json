This review will compare the immunotherapies recently approved by the FDA (ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab) with the long-approved immunotherapy, interleukin-2. Additional consideration will be given to the evolving landscape, including the opportunities for combination regimens. Immunotherapies have distinct mechanisms of action and unique response kinetics that differ from conventional cytotoxic and targeted therapies, and have a range of adverse events that can be safely managed by experienced health care providers. Data suggest immunotherapies can result in long-term survival in a proportion of patients. This dynamic and evolving field of immunotherapy for melanoma will continue to offer challenges in terms of optimal patient management for the foreseeable future.","title":"Interleukin-2, Ipilimumab, and Anti-PD-1: Clinical Management and the Evolving Role of Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Melanoma.","pubmedId":"26418961"}
