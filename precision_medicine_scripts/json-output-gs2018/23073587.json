The correlations between the P16 and the clinic-pathological features (menstruation, tumor size, histological grade, lymph node metastasis were statistically analyzed.\nAberrant expression of P16 was detected in 36.1%(26/72)of breast cancers. Not only was the staining of P16 increased,but also the subcellular localization was changed from nuclear to cytoplasm or whole cell staining. In general, the occasional cell staining (+) usually presented in nuclear, as expression increased, P16 showed mainly in cytoplasm or whole cells (+++) even diffusive staining in extracellular, and the moderate staining was multi-focal both in nuclear and cytoplasm. The expression of P16 was significantly increased in ER negative group compared with ER positive group (78.6% vs. 9.1%,P\u003d0.000). Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation of high Ki-67 index with the group of P16 positive (Z \u003d-0.263, P\u003d0.003). In addition, significant difference was calculated between pre- and post-menopause (55.6% vs. 24.4%, P\u003d0.008)and P16 expressions were also more credited to the poor-differentiated group in histological grading: 11.8% (2/17) for highly differentiated group, 27.6% (8/29) for moderately differentiated group and 61.5% (16/26) for poorly differentiated group, respectively (P\u003d0.002).\nThe aberrant expression of P16 in breast cancers correlated closely with loss of estrogen receptor, high proliferation index or high histological grade, predisposed to the patients of pre-menopause, implicating that the aberrant expression of P16 should be a predictor of poor response to endocrine therapy or more aggressive behavior.","title":"[Aberrant expression and correlative analysis of P16 in breast cancers].","pubmedId":"23073587"}
