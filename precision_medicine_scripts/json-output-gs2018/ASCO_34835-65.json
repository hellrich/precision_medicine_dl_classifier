Methods: Two hundred thirty-four patients with ductal breast cancer who underwent surgery with curative intent were enrolled in the present study. The tumor expressions of p53, ER, PR, and HER2 were graded immunohistochemically and TP53 codon 72 polymorphism was determined by a PCR-RFLP assay using genomic DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue. Results: The median age was 49 (range, 24-82) years, and 134 (57.3%) patients were premenopause at the time of diagnosis. Pathologic stages after surgery were as follows: stage I (n\u003d77, 32.9%), stage II (n\u003d110, 47.0%), and stage III (n\u003d47, 20.1%). Tumor overexpression of p53 protein was observed in 59 (25.2%) patients and was associated with an unfavorable relapse-free survival (RFS) in an univariate analysis adjusted to age, stage, and menstrual status. In a multivariate analysis, p53 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (HR\u003d2.36; 95% CI\u003d1.09-5.13; p\u003d0.030). However, no associations were observed between the genotype of TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and survival or clinicopathologic characteristics. Conclusions: Overexpression of p53 protein can be considered as a prognostic factor for RFS in the breast cancer patients after surgery.","title":"Association between P53 expression or TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and prognosis in patients with operated invasive breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_34835-65"}
