The response to chemoradiotherapy was evaluated endoscopically and by histological examination in 16 patients who underwent surgical resection.\nIndependent factors predictive of a complete endoscopic response were good performance status (RR\u003d15.75; CI: 1.74-142.58; P\u003d0.01) and overexpression of Ki67 (RR\u003d4.46; CI: 1.08-18.31; P\u003d0.04). In patients who underwent surgery, a major histopathological response was associated with complete endoscopic response (P\u003c0.01), complete CT-scan response (P\u003d0.04) and good performance status (WHO\u003d0) (P\u003d0.04). The mean survival was 40 months. Adenocarcinoma histology (RR\u003d3.18, CI: 1.13-8.54; P\u003d0.02) and an impaired performance status (RR\u003d4.79; CI: 1.07-21.41; P\u003d0.04) were independently associated with poor survival.\nIn the present study, good performance status and overexpression of Ki67 were two independent factors for complete endoscopic response after chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer. Independent risk factors for poor survival were adenocarcinoma histological type and impaired performance status. Further prospective studies are necessary to complete the present results.","title":"Predictive factors of the response to chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"18555630"}
