Reducing overall treatment time is known to improve outcome in the radiotherapy of HNSCC as was also demonstrated in the randomised DAHANCA 6\u00267 trial. We aimed to assess the influence of tumour HPV-status, expressed by p16, on the response to accelerated fractionated radiotherapy in HNSCC through evaluation of the DAHANCA 6\u00267 trial.\nImmunohistochemical detection of HPV-associated p16-expression was performed on FFPE-pre-treatment tumour-tissues from 794 patients enrolled in the DAHANCA 6\u00267 trial. The influence of tumour p16-status on loco-regional tumour control and survival as a function of fractionation schedule (5Fx/week vs 6Fx/week) was evaluated 5years after the completion of radiotherapy.\nThe significant and independent prognostic value of tumour p16-positivity in HNSCC radiotherapy was confirmed, with adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of 0.58 [0.43-0.78], 0.47 [0.33-0.67] and 0.54 [0.42-0.68] for loco-regional control, disease-specific and overall survival, respectively. Accelerated radiotherapy significantly improved loco-regional tumour control compared to conventional radiotherapy, adjusted HR: 0.73 [0.59-0.92] and the benefit of the 6Fx/week regimen was observed both in p16-positive (HR: 0.56 [0.33-0.96]) as well as in p16-negative tumours (HR: 0.77 [0.60-0.99]). Disease-specific survival was also significantly improved with accelerated radiotherapy in the group of p16-positive tumours (adjusted HR: 0.43 [0.22-0.82]).\nAccelerated radiotherapy significantly improves outcome in HNSCC compared to conventional fractionation. The observed benefit is independent of tumour p16-status and the use of a moderately accelerated radiotherapy regimen seems advantageous also for HPV/p16-positive HNSCC.","title":"The influence of HPV-associated p16-expression on accelerated fractionated radiotherapy in head and neck cancer: evaluation of the randomised DAHANCA 6\u00267 trial.","pubmedId":"21429609"}
