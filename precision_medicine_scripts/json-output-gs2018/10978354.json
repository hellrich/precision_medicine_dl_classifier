DESIGN, SETTINGS: We examined 21 metastatic melanoma samples for 10q23 allelic losses and PTEN sequence alterations. Additionally, we screened these samples for mutations in CDKN2A, a gene in which alterations are well documented in primary melanoma as well as in the germline of familial melanoma.\nLoss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 10q23 was observed in 33% (7/21) of the samples tested. We identified four sequence alterations in PTEN (19%) and two in CDKN2A (9.5%). Of interest, only one case showed mutations in both genes.\nThese data support the notion that PTEN alterations occur in some metastatic melanomas, and that mutation of this gene plays a role in the progression of some forms of melanoma.","title":"Identification of PTEN mutations in metastatic melanoma specimens.","pubmedId":"10978354"}
