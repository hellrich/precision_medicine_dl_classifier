The role of EphB4 in breast cancer is not fully elucidated. EphB-receptors transmit forward and reverse signals, which together are known as bidirectional signals. EphB4 reverse signaling, mediated by the ephrin-B2 ligand expressed in endothelial cells, causes some of the oncogenic properties of the receptor. In contrast, EphB4 forward signaling suppresses tumor growth. In breast cancers with high EphB4-receptor expression the forward signaling activity is low due to low expression of ephrin-B2. In fact, the EFNB2 gene, encoding ephrin-B2, is located on chromosome 13, which is lost in more than 30% of breast cancers. Our hypothesis was that ephrin-B2 re-expression in tumors could restore EphB4-forward signal inhibiting tumor growth. To examine the effects of EphB4-ephrin-B2 co-expression in vitro, we used lentiviral vectors to stably infect MCF7 cells with ephrin-B2. We found in vitro that ephrin-B2 expression caused cell detachment, inhibited cell proliferation; focus formation and cell motility, all characteristics of tumor suppression. Likewise, in patient materials we observed that high ephrin-B2 mRNA levels correlated with better distant recurrence-free survival. Interestingly, low ephrin-B2 expression identifies the group of worse prognosis among patients with high EphB4 and HER-2 expression in terms of distant recurrence and breast cancer survival. Taken together these results support our hypothesis and suggest that ephrin-B2 may be a tumor suppressor and a novel prognostic marker in breast cancer.","title":"Ephrin B2 as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-1981"}
