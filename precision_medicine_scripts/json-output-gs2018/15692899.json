Only when dysphagia occurred in the course of the disease was a gastroenterologist consulted.\nThe diagnosis of diffuse esophageal spasm was confirmed by esophageal manometry and radiology. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed no further pathological findings.\n100 units of botulinum toxin were injected in 10 divided doses, into the tubular esophagus, 1 cm apart, beginning at the z-line of the gastroesophageal junction, deeply into the muscular coat of the posterior part of the esophageal wall. This achieved improvement of symptoms as well as esophageal transit time measured by scintigraphy. The symptomatic benefit has now lasted for several months.\nThe treatment of patients with diffuse esophageal spasm with botulinum toxin is a promising therapeutic option, which can be safely performed in such patients. But this regime needs evaluation in controlled prospective clinical studies.","title":"[Injection of botulinum toxin for diffuse esophageal spasm].","pubmedId":"15692899"}
