It improves tumor response rates and progression free survival compared to vemurafenib alone, while decreasing toxicities due to the paradoxical activation of the MAPK signaling pathway.\nThis review covers the pharmacology, efficacy, and toxicity data derived from clinical and preclinical studies on cobimetinib. It also reports ongoing trials evaluating cobimetinib to better understand future developments for this drug.\nThe combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib seems to be more toxic than the combination therapy dabrafenib and trametinib even if these four drugs have never been compared in a randomized trial. The future of this combination depends on its capacity to be combined simultaneously or sequentially with immune based therapies to improve the durability of responses.","title":"Cobimetinib and vemurafenib for the treatment of melanoma.","pubmedId":"26999478"}
