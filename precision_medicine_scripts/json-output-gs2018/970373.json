They represent two of a total of 16 male patients with mammary carcinomas examined at the Medical College of Virginia between 1950 and 1975. Two previous similar cases have been reported in the literature as \"small-cell\" carcinoma. In one of the current cases there is unexplained benign lobular proliferation with atypical features suggesting lobular origin of the infiltrating tumor.","title":"Small-cell carcinoma of the male mammary gland.
