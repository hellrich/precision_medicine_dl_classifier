To model PTC, we bred mice with adult-onset, thyrocyte-specific expression of BRAF(V600E). One month following BRAF(V600E) expression, mice displayed increased thyroid size, widespread alterations in thyroid architecture, and dramatic hypothyroidism. Over 1 year, without any deliberate manipulation of tumor suppressor genes, all mice developed PTC displaying nuclear atypia and marker expression characteristic of the human disease. Pharmacologic inhibition of MEK1/2 led to decreased thyroid size, restoration of thyroid form and function, and inhibition of tumorigenesis. Mice with BRAF(V600E)-induced PTC will provide an excellent system to study thyroid tumor initiation and progression and the evaluation of inhibitors of oncogenic BRAF signaling.","title":"Mutationally activated BRAF(V600E) elicits papillary thyroid cancer in the adult mouse.","pubmedId":"21512141"}
