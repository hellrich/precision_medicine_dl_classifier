Here, we demonstrate that monensin inhibited the proliferation of solid tumor cells with IC50 of about 2.5 micro M. Monensin induced a G1 or a G2-M phase arrest in these cells. When we examined the effects of this drug on SNU-C1 cells, monensin decreased the levels of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1 and cyclin A proteins. While p27 was increased by monensin, p21 was not. In addition, monensin markedly enhanced the binding of p27 with CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6. Furthermore, the activities of CDK2-, CDK4- and CDK6-associated kinase were reduced in association with hypophosphorylation of Rb protein. Monensin also induced apoptosis in solid tumor cells. Apoptotic process of SNU-C1 cells was associated with the changes of Bax, caspase-3 and mitochondria transmembrane potential (deltapsim). Taken together, these results demonstrated for the first time that monensin inhibited the growth of solid tumor cells, especially SNU-C1 cells, via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.","title":"Monensin-mediated growth inhibition of SNU-C1 colon cancer cells via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.","pubmedId":"12527937"}
