As this event occurs early in melanoma progression, the quantification of BRAF-mutated alleles in plasma may represent a useful biomarker for noninvasive diagnosis and prediction of response to therapy.\nWe propose an assay based on the use of a locked nucleic acid probe and an allele specific primer to measure plasma-circulating BRAF(V600E) concentration in patients affected by cutaneous melanoma (n\u003d55) and non-melanoma skin cancers (n\u003d13) as well as 18 healthy subjects. The assay is highly sensitive and accurate in detecting down to 0.3% of mutated allele in plasma.\nA significant difference between the control group and invasive melanomas (p\u003c0.01) was evidenced in BRAF(V600E) concentration, either as relative percentage or absolute values. ROC curve indicated that BRAF(V600E) absolute concentration has the maximal diagnostic relevance with 97% sensitivity and 83% specificity. Comparison of the results obtained in plasma with those found in the corresponding tissues indicated an 80% concordance.\nThe allele specific Taqman-based real-time PCR assay allows the sensitive, accurate and reliable measurement of BRAF(V600E) mutated DNA in plasma.","title":"Allele specific Taqman-based real-time PCR assay to quantify circulating BRAFV600E mutated DNA in plasma of melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"20576522"}
