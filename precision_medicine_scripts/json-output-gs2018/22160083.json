The standard therapy for PTCLs is CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) or a comparable CHOP-like regimen that incorporates anthracyclines. With the exception of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(+) ALCL), the cure rate for PTCLs with CHOP is low, and limited evidence suggests that anthracyclines do not improve the prognosis. However, there is no compelling evidence that any other regimen or approach is superior. It remains challenging to compare alternative therapies or treatment strategies with CHOP because the majority of data are retrospective and include diverse patient populations. Recently, prospective studies have been initiated exclusively for PTCL, and in some, select histologic subtypes are evaluated in an effort to remove heterogeneity. Encouragingly, there have been several new therapies emerging with activity in PTCLs and exciting novel combinations under consideration that will hopefully move the field forward and improve outcome in this challenging group of diseases.","title":"Therapies for peripheral T-cell lymphomas.","pubmedId":"22160083"}
