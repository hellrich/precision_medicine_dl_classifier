Somatic point mutation (ATG to ACG heterozygotic mutation at codon 918) of the RET proto-oncogene was detected in tumor tissue, as confirmed by immunohistochemical expression of RET oncoprotein. Our findings suggest that constitutive RET proto-oncogene activation may be involved in the development of mixed medullary-follicular thyroid carcinoma.","title":"RET proto-oncogene mutation in a mixed medullary-follicular thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11227733"}
