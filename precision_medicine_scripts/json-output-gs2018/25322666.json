The advanced form of skin cancer, melanoma, is resistant to conventional treatment methods, which motivated researchers to identify an alternative effective therapeutic approach. This study was designed to identify the effects of small interfering RNA (si-RNA) mediated silencing of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit D (EIF3D) against melanoma cell survival. Briefly, a lentivirus-mediated RNA interference system was employed to knock down EIF3D expression in A375 and A431 melanoma cells. The cell proliferation was analyzed by methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) and colony formation assays. The cell cycle progression was investigated using flow cytometry. Results revealed that si-RNA-mediated knockdown of EIF3D significantly reduced the gene and protein expression levels of EIF3D in melanoma cells. Furthermore, knockdown of EIF3D led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation due to G2 /M phase cell cycle arrest. Apparently, the study demonstrated the critical involvement of EIF3D in the survival and progression of melanoma cells and depletion of EIF3D could be developed as a possible therapeutic option in the gene-targeted treatment of melanoma.
