Despite improved multimodal therapies, the tumor recurs in most cases. Diverging patient survival suggests great tumor heterogeneity and different therapy responses. Danger signals such as high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and calreticulin (CRT) are biomarker candidates, due to their association with tumor progression versus induction of antitumor immune responses. Overexpression of these danger signals has been reported for various types of tumors; however, their role in GBM is still elusive. A direct comparison of their expression in the primary tumor versus the corresponding relapse is still lacking for most tumor entities.\nWe therefore performed an expression analysis by immunohistochemistry of the danger signals HMGB1, HSP70, and CRT in primary tumors and the corresponding relapses of 9 patients with de novo GBM.\nHMGB1 was highly expressed in primary tumors with a significant reduction in the respective relapse. The extracellular HSP70 expression was significantly increased in the relapse compared to the primary tumor. CRT was generally highly expressed in the primary tumor, with a slight increase in the relapse.\nThe combination of a decreased expression of HMGB1, an increased expression of extracellular HSP70, and an increased expression of CRT in the relapse seems to be beneficial for patient survival. HMGB1, extracellular HSP70, and CRT could be taken into concerted consideration as potential biomarkers for the prognosis of patients with GBM.","title":"Primary glioblastoma multiforme tumors and recurrence : Comparative analysis of the danger signals HMGB1, HSP70, and calreticulin.","pubmedId":"26646311"}
