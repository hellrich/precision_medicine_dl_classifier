We recently discovered a new oncogenic fusion involving NTRK1 that can be targeted by kinase inhibitors against the TRK family of receptor tyrosine kinases. We therefore investigated NTRK1cytogenetic patterns of tumor samples from NSCLC patients to determine the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients in this unselected cohort.  Methods:   A tumor microarray (TMA) previously analyzed by ALK (12/445\u003d2.7%), ROS1 (5/429\u003d1.2%) and RET (6/348\u003d1.7%) FISH containing 447 tumor samples from patients with NSCLC was analyzed.  Clinical characteristics of the TMA have been reported previously.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) screening using a novel dual color NTRK1 break-apart assay was performed.  RT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from corresponding tumor blocks to confirm the presence and identify of the NTRK1fusion partner.  A novel proximity-ligation assay (PLA) to detect TRKA activation by detecting TRK-SHC1 protein complexes was developed as a complimentary, proteomic method for the detection of TRK activation, regardless of the mechanism of activation.  Results:  NTRK1 FISH analysis was successfully performed on 443 of 447 tumor samples (99.1%).   Five of 443 (1.1%) tumor samples exhibited patterns indicating an NTRK1 rearrangement with split (n\u003d1), single 3 (n\u003d1), or single 5 (n\u003d3) signals.  Clinical characteristics of the 5 NTRK1+ patients are as follows: 3 female;  2 never-smokers; and 3 adenocarcinoma, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, and 1 large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma histology.   An additional 5 samples had atypical cytogenetic patterns and 7 samples demonstrated focal NTRK1gene amplification warranting further exploration by alternate methodologies.  Conclusions:  NTRK1 gene rearrangements were detected in 1.1% of tumor samples from an unselected cohort of NSCLC patients. Additional NTRK1 cytogenetic patterns were observed and warrant further evaluation. Confirmatory testing by PCR to evaluate the specific NTRK1 fusion transcripts and a novel TRK PLA method will be presented.","title":"Analysis of NTRK1 gene fusion incidence in an unselected cohort of non-small cell lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_135058-144"}
