Methods: Patients with stage I-III melanoma were identified from the SEER-Medicare database (age  65, 2004- 2005). Stage-specific multivariate analyses were performed to assess physician specialty and nonadherence to NCCN guidelines while adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, comorbidity, and histology. Results: A total of 3,287 patients were identified with stage IA (47%), stage IB (26%), stage II (21%), and stage III (6%) melanoma. Initial melanoma diagnosis was made by dermatologists (DERM: 56%), general surgeons (SURG: 18%), primary care physicians (PCP: 10%), plastic surgeons (PLS: 8%), surgical oncologists (SURGONC: 2%), and other specialties (6%). Definitive treatment was subsequently rendered by SURG (32%), DERM (28%), PLS (10%), SURGONC (5%), other surgical specialties (OSS: 4%), PCP (3%), and unknown provider types (18%). Of the 13% of patients receiving suboptimal/nonadherent treatment, 91% were stage IB or II largely due to the omission of sentinel lymph node mapping. In patients with stage IB and II melanoma, multivariate analyses revealed that provider of definitive treatment, patient age, marital status, geographic area, and histology were significant predictors of nonadherence. The likelihood of receiving nonadherent treatment varied according to the specialty of the provider: DERM (odds ratio [OR] \u003d 17.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4-34.7), PCP (OR \u003d 3.5 [1.5-8.5]), SURG (OR \u003d 1.3 [0.7-2.5]), PLS (OR \u003d 2.2 [1.1-4.6]), and OSS (OR \u003d 2.5 [1.1-5.5]) when compared to SURGONC. Conclusions: For elderly patients with stage IB and II melanoma, provider specialty is a significant predictor of guideline based treatment. Melanoma patients treated by SURG and SURGONC are more likely to receive treatment according to NCCN guidelines. The benefits of sentinel lymph node mapping should be promoted among all health care specialties related to melanoma care.","title":"The impact of physician specialty on quality of melanoma care.","pubmedId":"ASCO_48329-74"}
