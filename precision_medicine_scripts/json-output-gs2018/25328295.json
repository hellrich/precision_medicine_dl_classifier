Differentiating between AdCC and other salivary gland neoplasms can be a diagnostic challenge, particularly in examining tissues obtained from small incisional biopsies.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate c-kit expression in four common benign and malignant salivary gland neoplasms.\nImmunohistochemical techniques were used to analyze the level of c-kit expression in normal salivary gland (n \u003d 10) and four different types of salivary gland tumors: Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) (n \u003d 17), AdCC (n \u003d 9), polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) (n \u003d 4) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) (n \u003d 6). Samples were immunostained using monoclonal antibody against c-kit.\nThe immunoreactivity for c-kit was found in all cases of AdCC, PLGA and MEC and majority of PAs. Positive reactivity was observed in more than 50% of the tumor cells of AdCC and less than 50% in PLGA. PA did not show strong immunostaining and c-kit was predominantly localized to the cell membrane. Furthermore, the difference in the expression of c-kit between the benign and malignant neoplasms was not statistically significant.\nCD117 expression itself cannot be used as a marker in differential diagnosis of salivary gland neoplasms. However, the percentage of the CD117 immunoreactive cells and the staining intensities appeared to be important factors in distinguishing AdCC from PLGA and PA.","title":"Evaluation of c-kit protein (CD117) expression in common salivary gland neoplasms.","pubmedId":"25328295"}
