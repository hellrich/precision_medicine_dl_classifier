Methods In this phase I dose-finding study, we assessed the safety, feasibility, pharmacokinetics (PK), and exploratory anti-tumor activity of atezolizumab monotherapy up to 20 mg/kg in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors who had failed standard therapy or for whom there is no standard therapy. Results Six patients were enrolled and received intravenous atezolizumab every 3 weeks (q3w) at doses of 10 or 20 mg/kg. Tumor types were non-small cell lung cancer (n \u003d 3), melanoma (n \u003d 1), pancreatic cancer (n \u003d 1), and thymic cancer (n \u003d 1). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2 in severity. No discontinuations or deaths due to AEs were observed. As of the data cutoff, no partial responses were observed; however, stable disease was observed in all six patients. The maximum mean serum atezolizumab concentration was 220 μg/mL (SD ± 21.9), with 10-mg/kg dosing and 536 μg/mL (SD ± 49.4) with 20-mg/kg dosing. Three patients were still on treatment, and three of the six had achieved a progression-free survival of \u003e12 months. Conclusions Atezolizumab was well tolerated in Japanese patients at doses up to 20 mg/kg q3w. The safety profile and Cycle 1 serum atezolizumab concentrations were similar to those previously observed in non-Japanese patients. These data support the participation of Japanese patients in ongoing pivotal global studies of atezolizumab.
