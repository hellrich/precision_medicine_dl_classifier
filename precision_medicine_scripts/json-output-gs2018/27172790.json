The predictive power of this model was validated in another independent sample set; the predictive sensitivity of this model for LNM was 87.5%, with specificity up to 97.4%, and accuracy 92.9%. Furthermore, a higher membranous E-cadherin level was significantly correlated with better overall and disease-free survival (OS, DFS; P \u003d 0.002, 0.033, respectively), while lower cytoplasmic vimentin and membranous EGFR levels were significantly correlated with better OS (P \u003d 0.016 and 0.021, respectively). The combined biomarkers showed a stronger prognostic value for OS and DFS than any of the single biomarkers.\nMultiplexed quantum dots (QDs) were used to simultaneously label E-cadherin, vimentin, and EGFR with β-actin as an internal control. Primary tissue samples from 97 HNSCC patients, 49 with and 48 without LNM were included in the training set. Levels of membranous E-cadherin, cytoplasmic vimentin, and membranous EGFR were quantified by InForm software and correlated with clinical characteristics.\nMultiplexed subcellular QD quantification of EGFR and E-cadherin is a potential strategy for the prediction of LNM, DFS, and OS of HNSCC patients.","title":"Biomarker quantification by multiplexed quantum dot technology for predicting lymph node metastasis and prognosis in head and neck cancer.","pubmedId":"27172790"}
