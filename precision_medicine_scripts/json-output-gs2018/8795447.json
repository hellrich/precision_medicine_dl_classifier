We aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in gastric cancer, non-gastric cancer and outpatients by ELISA and iso-electric focusing, and to compare histology and serology for H. pylori in gastric cancer and outpatients. 2. In 124 patients with gastric cancer, 78 patients with non-gastric cancer and 110 outpatients, H. pylori seroprevalence was assessed by ELISA and isoelectric focusing. Gastric cancer and outpatients underwent endoscopy with biopsies. 3. Seroprevalence by ELISA was significantly higher in gastric cancer compared with non-gastric cancer (84% versus 56%, P \u003c 0.001) but not with outpatients (84% versus 74%). Iso-electric focusing detection of H. pylori was comparable to ELISA: 85, 51 and 75% in gastric cancer, non-gastric cancer and outpatients respectively. Oligoclonal iso-electric focusing was significantly more frequent in gastric cancer compared with non-gastric cancer and outpatients: 69% versus 45 and 46% respectively, P \u003c 0.01. The reliability of H. pylori detection by antral biopsy was significantly lower in gastric cancer compared with outpatients: 36% versus 74% (P \u003c 0.001). In gastric cancer, ELISA and iso-electric focusing were significantly more reliable than histology in H. pylori detection (84 and 85% versus 36% respectively) (P \u003c 0.001). 4. Serological immune response to H. pylori in gastric cancer, non-gastric cancer and outpatients seems different both quantitatively and qualitatively; serology was more reliable than histology in detection of H. pylori in gastric cancer.","title":"Serological response to Helicobacter pylori in gastric and non-gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"8795447"}
