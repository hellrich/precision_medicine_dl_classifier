The activation mechanism of the most often occurring mutation, D816V in exon 17 of c-Kit, has been well studied while other mutations remain fairly uncharacterized in this respect. In this study, we show that the constitutive activity of the exon 11 mutant V560D is weaker than the D816V mutant except that the phosphorylation of the Src family kinase binding site, Tyr568, is similar in both c-Kit mutants. The ligand for c-Kit, stem cell factor (SCF), induced phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins, such as Akt and Erk, in c-Kit/V560D expressing cells was stronger than that in c-Kit/D816V expressing cells. Although cells expressing c-Kit/V560D showed increased ligand-independent proliferation and survival compared to wild-type c-Kit expressing cells, these biological effects were less than c-Kit/D816V expressing cells. In contrast to cells expressing wild-type c-Kit, cells expressing c-Kit/V560D are independent of Src family kinases for downstream signaling. However, this independence of Src family kinases is not due to a Src-like kinase activity of the mutant receptor that c-Kit-D816V holds. Blockage of the association of PI3 kinase with c-Kit/V560D by point mutation, but not inhibition of PI3-kinase with pharmacological inhibitors, totally blocked ligand-independent activation of the receptor, suggesting a key role of the non-lipid kinase activity of PI3 kinase in c-Kit/V560D mediated oncogenic signal transduction. Thus, PI3 kinase is an attractive treatment target in c-Kit mutations induced malignancies independent of its lipid kinase activity.","title":"PI3 kinase plays important role in c-Kit/V560D mediated oncogenic signaling","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-126"}
