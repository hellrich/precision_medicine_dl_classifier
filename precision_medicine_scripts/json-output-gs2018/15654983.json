Despite this florid clinical problem, ARD treatments have been reported to affect experimental murine skin carcinogenesis only weakly. We report here that treatment of cesium-137-irradiated Ptch1+/- mice with immunosuppressive doses of cyclosporine A plus prednisolone for 4-1/2 mo increased basal cell carcinoma burden by 2.5-fold. Thus, these mice provide a good model for study of the effects of long-term administration of ARD on at least one type of non-melanoma skin cancer.","title":"Anti-rejection drug treatment increases basal cell carcinoma burden in Ptch1+/- mice.","pubmedId":"15654983"}
