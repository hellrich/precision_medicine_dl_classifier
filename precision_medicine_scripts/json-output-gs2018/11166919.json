They were divided into three groups: group A, patients whose primary tumor showed extrathyroidal invasion (n\u003d31); group B, those whose metastatic lymph nodes showed extranodal invasion (n\u003d6); group C, those who showed both extrathyroidal and extranodal invasion (n\u003d9). Recurrence was significantly higher in groups B and C than in group A (P\u003c0.05). It was concluded that macroscopic extranodal invasion to the adjacent structures was a risk factor for recurrence in patients with papillary thyroid cancer.","title":"Macroscopic extranodal invasion is a risk factor for tumor recurrence in papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"11166919"}
