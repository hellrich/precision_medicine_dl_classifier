Thicker tumors were associated with nodular histologic features (43.9%), a lack of atypical nevi, having less than a high school education, and patient vs physician (dermatologist or nondermatologist) detection. Knowledge of melanoma (P \u003d .007), attention to skin cancer detection information (P \u003d .02), an interest in health topics (P \u003d .003), and knowing the importance of physician skin examination (P \u003d .05) were more common in those with thin tumors. Tumor thickness did not correlate with age, anatomic location, marital/cohabitation status, prior skin cancer, or sun sensitivity. Overall patient awareness of melanoma warning signs, skin self-examination practices, and Internet use were poor (\u003c20%, \u003c50%, and \u003c14%, respectively).\nPhysician discovery, the patient\u0027s higher level of education and detection-promoting awareness and attitudes, and the presence of clinically atypical nevi were related to thinner melanomas. Innovative outreach strategies and novel educational campaigns incorporating these factors, coupled with sharper messages regarding the importance of physician screening, are needed to improve early detection in middle-aged and older men.","title":"Melanoma in middle-aged and older men: a multi-institutional survey study of factors related to tumor thickness.","pubmedId":"19380661"}
