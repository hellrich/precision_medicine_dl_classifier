The lesion was suspected clinically to be an atypical iris melanoma. Histopathologic studies of the resected mass revealed a solid tumor that was comprised of lymphocytes and histiocytes. Immunohistochemical studies identified that most of the cells were T lymphocytes. The histopathologic diagnosis was atypical lymphoid infiltrate. Workup for systemic lymphoma and Epstein-Barr virus infection was negative.\nLymphoid infiltrate can manifest as a solitary mass that can simulate an iris melanoma.","title":"Benign lymphoid infiltrate of the iris simulating a malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"11973396"}
