Methods: Subjects were 128 breast cancer patients with brain metastases as the first and isolated site of recurrence that were selected from 673 consecutive breast cancer patients with brain metastases treated at the same institution. Results: Median survival from brain metastases in patients with and without systemic treatment after local therapy was respectively 15 and 4 months (p\u003c 0.001). In patients with a Karnofsky Performance Status \u003e \u003d 70 and those \u003c 70, survival was respectively 16 and 5.5 months (p\u003c 0.001). The median survival from brain metastasis in patients with solitary brain metastasis, with and without systemic treatment after local therapy, was respectively 22 and 7 months (p\u003d 0.003). In the triple-negative subtype group, median survival following the diagnosis of brain metastases in those treated and untreated with systemic therapy was respectively 10 and 5 months, (p\u003d 0.212). Median survival after brain metastases diagnosis for the two HER2-positive subtypes (HER2+, ER/PgR+ and HER2+ ER-PgR-), post and without systemic therapy, was respectively 16 and 4 months, (p\u003c 0.001) and in the luminal subtype 20 and 3 months were respectively observed (p\u003d 0.102). Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that good performance status, solitary brain metastasis and systemic therapy undertaken after local treatment were factors which prolonged survival. However patient survival was adversely affected by those having leptomeningeal metastasis associated with brain parenchymal lesions. Conclusions: Systemic therapy, undertaken after local treatment improved survival in those patients with breast cancer and brain metastases as the site of first recurrence. Further study is required in order to fully establish the role of systemic treatment for this patient group.","title":"The role of systemic therapy after local treatment in breast cancer patients with first presentation of brain metastases recurrence.","pubmedId":"ASCO_167246-176"}
