In addition, adhesive interactions between tumor cells and adjacent cells and/or extracellular matrix play important roles in the complex process of tumor growth and development. Among these adhesion molecules, expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) has been identified in colon cancer, bladder cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the current study, we analyzed serum ICAM-1 concentrations to investigate the relationship between the serum ICAM-1 level and prognosis in patients with lung cancer.\nSerum ICAM-1 was measured in 84 patients with lung cancer according to the pathologic type and clinical stage using the ICAM-1 ELISA kit. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse survival time.\nThere was no difference in serum ICAM-1 concentration among the different stages of lung cancer. Furthermore, there was no difference observed between histologic tumor type with regard to serum ICAM-1 concentration. Although the difference was not significant, the overall survival times of patients with a low serum ICAM-1 concentration (\u003c 306 ng/mL) was longer than that of patients with a high concentration (\u003e or \u003d 306 ng/mL) in non-small cell lung cancer patients.\nThese results suggest that high levels of serum ICAM-1 reflect poor prognosis for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","title":"The relationship between the serum intercellular adhesion molecule-1 level and the prognosis of the disease in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"15053044"}
