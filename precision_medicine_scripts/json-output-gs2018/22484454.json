Twenty BSGs located in the pons and were all in children. Four BSGs located in the medulla oblongata were in 2 children and 2 adults. One (in a child) was located in the midbrain. Radiological findings on MR images were low-intensity on T1 weighted images and high-intensity on T2 weighted images. Mean survival when pontine glioma was treated by radiotherapy and/or use of temozolomide was 14 months, although 4 patients (3 cervicomedullary types and one focal type arising from midbrain) are alive. Follow up was from 5 months to 6 years. Histopathological features of 10 cases of the diffuse type were: 4 grade II astrocytomas, 4 grade III astrocytomas, and 2 glioblastomas. MIB-1 index was from 0.8 to 38 %. P53 was positive for 80 % of 15 tumors and there were no negative results. MGMT was positive in 60 % of 15 tumors and negative in 12.4 %. IDH1 was negative in 61.6 %. There was no positive result for IDH1 in this study. Thus, our histopathological results were indicative of high p53 immunoreactivity and no IDH1 immunoreactivity related to secondary malignant change.","title":"Clinicopathological features of human brainstem gliomas.","pubmedId":"22484454"}
