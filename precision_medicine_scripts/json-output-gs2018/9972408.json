Eight were Chinese, two Indians. The male:female ratio was 1.5:1, and the median age was 32 years. Seven patients presented with B-symptoms, and five had stage III/IV disease. The majority (seven of ten) was low- or low-intermediate risk according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI). Four out of five cases immunophenotyped showed a T-cell origin. Five out of eight patients who received first-line combination chemotherapy achieved a complete remission. Two relapsed, with one being re-induced into a durable second remission. One patient with recurrent cutaneous lymphoma received solely radiotherapy and was disease-free at 20+ years from diagnosis. At analysis, two patients had died, five were disease-free at four, 27, 78, 89 months and 20 years respectively, and three were alive with disease. The IPI appears to have prognostic significance.\nIncidence and clinical characteristics in our Asian patients were similar to those described in Western populations. The IPI appears to have prognostic relevance. In approximately one-third of patients, long term survival can be achieved with standard treatment.","title":"Characteristics and prognosis of KI-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma in Asians.","pubmedId":"9972408"}
