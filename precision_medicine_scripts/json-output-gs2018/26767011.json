They are primarily diseases of adults; however, they may be encountered in children. They are characterized by their large size and variable histologic subtypes, which correlate with clinical behavior and prognosis. Although the overall prognosis is poor, it is dependent upon the histologic subtype and completeness of surgical excision. Herein we present a case of a primary mediastinal pleomorphic liposarcoma in a 49-year-old male who received an en-bloc resection and superior vena cava replacement with Gortex graft. The patient has been disease-free after surgery for over 14 months. ","title":"Primary mediastinal pleomorphic liposarcoma involving the superior vena cava.","pubmedId":"26767011"}
