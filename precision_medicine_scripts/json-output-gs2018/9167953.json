In MEN type 1, the major lesions affect parathyroid glands, pancreatic islet cells and anterior pituitary. The MEN-1 gene has been mapped to chromosome 11q13 and a set of DNA-polymorphic markers localized close to this region provides a useful tool for presymptomatic diagnosis in MEN-1 families. MEN type 2 refers to the inherited forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) associated or not with pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. In MEN-2, germinal mutations of the C-RET proto-oncogene which is localized on chromosome 10q11 have been found in the three clinical and allelic forms of the syndrome respectively, MEN-2 type A, B and familial isolated MTC. Mutations of C-RET are found in more than 90% of MEN-2 patients and genetic screening leads to accurate risk evaluation in families and consequently a preventive treatment of MTC and adrenal neoplasms. Recent discoveries on MEN syndromes and related familial endocrine disorders have a major clinical impact and allow a better understanding of the physiological pathways involved in familial as well as in sporadic endocrine tumor pathogenesis.","title":"Genetic testing in presymptomatic diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia.","pubmedId":"9167953"}
