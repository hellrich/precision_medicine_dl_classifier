{"publicationTypes":["2014 AACR Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine tumor. The gold standard, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, yields 10-25% indeterminate results necessitating diagnostic surgery. Using the real-time imaging technique of elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS), a pair of fiber optics are inserted through the lumen of a biopsy needle and placed in contact with the thyroid nodule moments before cell collection occurs. Our research focuses on utilizing this optical-biopsy technique to measure tissue in vivo with broadband light during biopsy. In this study we demonstrate the potential our novel ESS-integrated optical biopsy syringe can have on cancer diagnostics. Spectra from 148 patients were collected. Additional time during biopsy to perform ESS measurements was less than 20 seconds. Cytology results for enrolled patients were as follows: 37 indeterminate, 6 insufficient, 5 malignant and 100 benign. Correlating ESS measurements with cytology, we identified changes in spectra when fiber optics were placed in contact with malignant versus benign tissue. From our enrolled benign and malignant patients, we trained an algorithm to diagnose indeterminate nodules based off of ESS spectra and compared to pathology. Preliminary analysis of spectra show ESS has a NPV of 0.99, a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.85. This data suggests that elastic scattering spectroscopy may improve the reliability, speed, and cost of cancer diagnostics.","title":"Addressing the limitations of thyroid biopsies: Using elastic scattering spectroscopy to improve the assessment of indeterminate nodules","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4294"}
