Human ADPKD cystic epithelia have proliferative abnormalities mediated by EGFR over-expression and mispolarization leading autocrine response to EGF family ligands. We now show that apical localization of EGFR complexes in normal fetal and ADPKD epithelia is associated with heterodimerization of EGFR(HER-1) with HER-2(neu/ErbB2), while basal membrane localization in normal adult renal epithelia is associated with EGFR(HER-1) homodimers. Since ADPKD epithelial cells have reduced migratory function, this was used as a bioassay to evaluate the ability of compounds to rescue the aberrant human ADPKD phenotype. General tyrosine kinase inhibition by herbimycin and specific inhibition of HER-2(neu/ErbB2) by AG825 or pretreatment with ErbB2 siRNA reversed the migration defect of ADPKD epithelia. Selective inhibition of EGFR(HER-1) showed partial rescue. Increased ADPKD cell migration after inhibition of p38MAP kinase but not of PI3-kinase implicated p38MAPK downstream of HER-2(neu/ErbB2) stimulation. Daily administration of AG825 to PKD1 null heterozygous mice significantly inhibited the development of renal cysts. These studies implicate HER2(neu/ErbB2) as an effector of apical EGFR complex mispolarization and that its inhibition should be considered a candidate for clinical therapy of ADPKD.","title":"Inhibition of HER-2(neu/ErbB2) restores normal function and structure to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) epithelia.","pubmedId":"16797938"}
