The prognosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma is poor for its high frequency of distant metastases and insensitivity to chemotherapy or molecular therapies. This study investigated the effect of Obatoclax on adenoid cystic carcinoma cells and its cytotoxic mechanism.\nWestern blot, transmission electron microscopy, and pEGFP-LC3 plasmids transfection were carried out to detect autophagy in ACC cells treated with Obatoclax. 3-MA and RNA interference against Beclin 1 and ATG5 were used to inhibit autophagy. Then we used Western blot and Hochest 33342 staining for apoptosis assessment. Finally, cell viability was assessed by MTT assay.\nWe found that Obatoclax induced cytoprotective autophagy which depended on ATG5 and partly on Beclin 1 in adenoid cystic carcinoma cells. Furthermore, pharmacologically inhibiting Obatoclax-induced autophagy promoted apoptosis. Downregulation of Beclin 1 or ATG5 attenuated the cytotoxicity of Obatoclax by suppressing both autophagy and apoptosis. Finally, when apoptosis was pharmacologically inhibited, autophagic cell death was initiated in adenoid cystic carcinoma cells treated with Obatoclax.\nIn summary, Beclin 1 and ATG5 play important roles in regulating both Obatoclax-induced autophagy and apoptosis in adenoid cystic carcinoma.","title":"Obatoclax induces Beclin 1- and ATG5-dependent apoptosis and autophagy in adenoid cystic carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"25482163"}
