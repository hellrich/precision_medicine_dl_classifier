Growing evidence has indicated that high tumor NM23-H1 expression contributes to a good response to chemotherapy. Therefore, we investigated the role of NM23-H1 in susceptibility of HNSCC cells to cisplatin and its clinical significance, as well as the in vitro study for validation was performed. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed NM23-H1 expression in surgical specimens from 46 HNSCC patients with cervical metastases receiving surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Low tumor NM23-H1 expression correlated with locoregional recurrence of HNSCC following postoperative cisplatin-based therapy (p \u003d 0.056) and poor patient prognosis (p \u003d 0.001). To validate the clinical observation and the effect of NM23-H1 on cisplatin cytotoxicity, we established several stable clones derived from a human HNSCC cell line (SAS) by knockdown and overexpression. Knockdown of NM23-H1 attenuated the chemosensitivity of SAS cells to cisplatin, which was associated with reduced cisplatin-induced S-phase accumulation and downregulation of cyclin E1 and A. Overexpression of NM23-H1 reversed these results, indicating the essential role of NM23-H1 in treatment response to cisplatin. NM23-H1 may participate in HNSCC cell responses to cisplatin and be considered a potential therapeutic target.
