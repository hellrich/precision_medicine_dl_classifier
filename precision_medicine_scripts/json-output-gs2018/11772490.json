Perineural metastasis appears to be the most common mode of spread of head and neck SCCA to the brain. Pain, paresis, or paresthesias in the distribution of cranial nerves or other neurological symptoms should alert the otolaryngologist to neural or central nervous system involvement in patients with SCCA of the head and neck. Surgery with or without post-operative whole brain radiation therapy is the mainstay of treatment in most patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery may play a major role in treating brain metastases from head and neck primary tumors.","title":"Metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma to the brain.","pubmedId":"11772490"}
