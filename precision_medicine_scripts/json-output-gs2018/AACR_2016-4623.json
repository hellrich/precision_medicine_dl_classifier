It plays several roles such as cell fate decision, differentiation and stem cell maintenance. Notch signaling plays a role in the maintenance of melanoblasts and melanocyte stem cells of the epidermis by preventing their apoptosis. Notch signaling has also been implicated in different aspects of melanoma biology including tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Accordingly, Notch has been targeted for melanoma therapy both in preclinical xenograft models as well as clinical trials. Notch inhibitors, mainly -secretase inhibitors, have been widely used for this purpose. However, clinical trials with these agents have not been proven to be highly effective for melanoma treatment. In previously published studies we showed that Notch signaling is involved in regulation of melanoma trans-differentiation, a prognostic feature in primary melanoma. In this study, we reevaluated the role of Notch in melanoma development, cell survival and sensitivity to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. First, our preliminary data using the BRAFV600E/Pten mouse model showed that topical application of -secretase inhibitor DAPT delays tumor formation and growth. In several early passage metastatic human melanoma cell lines, we found that Notch receptors (Notch 1-3) are highly upregulated compared to normal epidermal melanocytes. Interestingly, mRNA levels for Notch1-3 receptors in normal melanocytes were either higher or comparable to their levels in the cell lines. This suggested that Notch receptor levels are tightly regulated in normal melanocytes by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Presence of cleaved Notch intracellular domain (NICD), both cytoplasmic and nuclear, in melanoma cells, but not in melanocytes, indicated constitutive activation of Notch signaling in melanoma cells. However, inhibition of Notch activation by treatment with -secretase inhibitor had no significant effect on survival of melanoma cells in vitro. Thus, Notch signaling appears to be dispensable for melanoma cell survival. Additionally, inhibition of Notch activation did not alter the sensitivity of melanoma cells to BRAF(V600E) and MEK inhibitors. Our results highlight the need for re-examination of Notch-regulated melanoma trans-differentiation as a therapeutic outcome.","title":"Reevaluation of the role of Notch signaling in melanoma tumor development, melanoma cell survival and drug resistance","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4623"}
