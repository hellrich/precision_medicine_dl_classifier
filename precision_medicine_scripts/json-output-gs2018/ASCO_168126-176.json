Crizotinib, an inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS1, and MET, showed marked antitumor activity in ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC (Shaw, N Engl J Med 2014). In the present study, we assessed the antitumor activity and safety of crizotinib in East Asian pts with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC. Methods: In this ongoing open-label, single-arm phase II study (NCT01945021), pts with ROS1-positive, ALK-negative advanced NSCLC who had received  3 lines of prior systemic therapy were administered crizotinib at a starting dose of 250 mg BID. Treatment was continued until RECIST-defined progression (determined by independent radiology review [IRR]), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, or at the investigators discretion for ongoing clinical benefit. The primary endpoint was ORR by IRR. Results: Between September 2013 and January 2015, 129 pts were enrolled at 37 sites in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, making this the largest study of ROS1-positive NSCLC to date. Crizotinib was administered to 127 pts (all were included in the antitumor and safety analyses), and 63% were ongoing at data cutoff (6 months after the last pt enrolled). ORR by IRR was 69% (95% CI: 6177) and was similar (6380%) irrespective of the number of prior lines of therapy. For most pts, responses were observed within the first 2 months. Disease control rates were 84% at week 8 and 76% at week 16. At data cutoff, responses were durable (median duration of response: not reached [NR]; 95% CI: 8.5 months  NR). The median duration of crizotinib treatment was 7.8 months. The most frequently reported all-causality AEs (any grade) were elevated transaminases (58%), vision disorder (47%), diarrhea (46%), and nausea (44%). Of 18 deaths on study (15 due to PD, 2 to pneumonia, and 1 to respiratory failure), none were attributed to crizotinib. Conclusions: This study supports the clinical benefit of crizotinib in East Asian pts with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC. Crizotinib was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with that previously reported.
