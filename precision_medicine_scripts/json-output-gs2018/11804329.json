In human T lymphocytes cdk6 has been shown to be the initial retinoblastoma protein kinase detectable at mid G1. Following activation of splenic derived murine G0T-cells, cdk6, cyclin D2 and D3 specific mRNAs were detected early in G1 and reached maximal levels prior to or near G1/S. The phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein from T-cells was detected very early in G1 and was associated mainly with cdk6/cyclin D2 complexes which accounted for a minor portion of the total cellular cdk6 contained in the cytoplasmic fraction of T-cells and mostly in the catalytically inactive form.","title":"The expression and characterization of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 during the activation of murine G0 T-cells.","pubmedId":"11804329"}
