For concordant assessment, serial sections from the same tissue blocks were prepared in both Turkey and Greece and were sent to each other. Evaluation of c-erbB2 (HER-2/Neu) staining was done independently in 2 departments by experienced pathologists. Stained slides were evaluated semiquantitatively in Turkey and both semiquantitatively and automatically in Greece.\nThere was complete agreement on staining density in 58 (64.4%) cases in both centers. In 15 cases there were major discordances in staining degrees, and in 17 cases there was a major discordance. Hypothetical treatment decisions based on these results showed that 82% of patients would have been handled the same way.\nComparison of immunostaining patterns performed at 2 centers provided valuable data that may be used in the development of quality assurance policies. The present study showed the usefulness of multicenter comparative studies in initiating the development of guidelines.","title":"Comparison of C-erbB2 (HER-2/Neu) immunohistochemistry results on invasive breast carcinomas.
