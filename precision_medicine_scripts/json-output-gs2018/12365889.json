These comorbid conditions were assigned integer weights to reflect their relative prognostic importance and combined to create the new Washington University Head and Neck Comorbidity Index (WUHNCI). Survival was significantly related to levels of comorbidity severity as defined by the WUHNCI. The WUHNCI predicted survival better than the Modified Kaplan-Feinstein Index despite containing far fewer ailments.\nComorbidity is an important feature of the patient with head and neck cancer. The WUHNCI can be used for retrospective review or prospective outcomes research.","title":"Development of a new head and neck cancer-specific comorbidity index.","pubmedId":"12365889"}
