The cytologic features of metastatic basaloid squamous cell carcinoma in fine needle aspiration specimens from nine patients are described. The primary tumors, when known, were located in the base of the tongue, tonsil, epiglottis, nasopharynx, hypopharynx and false vocal cord. Each neoplasm had large fragments or clusters of crowded cells and scattered single cells in the cytologic smears. The cells had round or oval, hyperchromatic nuclei that often had single, small nucleoli. The nuclei usually were small or medium sized, but six tumors had a few cells the nuclei of which were large and pleomorphic. The cytoplasm was typically scant, and only three cases had occasional keratinized cells. Necrosis was present in six neoplasms. Three neoplasms, originally diagnosed as small cell undifferentiated carcinoma, contained numerous single cells and small clusters of cells with nuclear molding. On review, however, smears from these neoplasms also contained a few large fragments of tightly cohesive cells with larger, vesicular nuclei. Another basaloid squamous cell carcinoma had been interpreted elsewhere as an adenoid cystic carcinoma because of the presence of pseudoglandular structures with stromal cores. Although the cytologic features of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma may mimic those of other poorly differentiated carcinomas in fine needle aspiration specimens, they are sufficiently distinctive that a diagnosis of this variant of squamous cell carcinoma can be suggested for a patient whose primary neoplasm is located in the upper aerodigestive tract.","title":"Fine needle aspiration cytologic findings in metastatic basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"1542993"}
