Phase II trial of NACRAC is ongoing. We report a very effective case to NACRAC for distal cholangiocarcinoma, which markedly reduced the size and levels of the tumor markers. The patient was a 50- year-old man who presented jaundice. Serum tumor markers were clearly elevated, and abdominal CT scan revealed an enhanced mass in the lower bile duct, a dilatation of the intrahepatic to the middle bile duct and a swollen regional lymph node. After NACRAC, the tumor markers were decreased within a normal range. Also on CT scan, the main tumor was slightly detectable and the swollen node was reduced more than 30% in short diameter. Therefore, the effect of NACRAC was considered PR in RECIST guidelines (ver.1 .1). Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed 2 weeks after NACRAC. No perioperative complications occurred. Pathological examination showed a good response, Grade 2b on Oboshi-Shimosato\u0027s classification. In this case, NACRAC had a good effect in imaging and pathological findings as well as in the tumor markers. Therefore, the neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy has a potential to improve the prognosis for cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"[A case of distal cholangiocarcinoma with high sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy].","pubmedId":"22202402"}
