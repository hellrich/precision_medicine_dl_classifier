Interestingly, elevated response rates to these agents are mostly documented among patients with tumors that bear high level of somatic mutations, like melanoma or non-small cell lung carcinoma. We herein formulate the hypothesis that high levels of mutational heterogeneity in the tumor could be the key for the success of immune checkpoint-targeting therapies.","title":"Exomics and immunogenics: Bridging mutational load and immune checkpoints efficacy.","pubmedId":"24605269"}
