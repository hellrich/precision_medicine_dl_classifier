KIT alterations have been implicated as oncogenic drivers, yet phase II trials of KIT inhibitors in advanced ALM demonstrate limited clinical efficacy. Identification of effective targeted treatment strategies remains a challenge given the limited existing data on the molecular underpinnings of ALM. Methods: We examined a cohort of ALM patients enrolled in NYUs melanoma biorepository to identify genetic alterations underlying ALM. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in a discovery cohort on genomic DNA extracted from fresh-frozen ALM tumors and matched whole blood. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data were then incorporated with WES to increase confidence in identifying recurrent nonsynonymous somatic mutations. Genes with recurrent mutations were examined in an independent validation cohort using target capture probes. Results: In the discovery cohort (n \u003d 8), we identified recurrent somatic mutations in known cancer-related genes, in addition to KIT and NF1, involving: metabolism (GPAT2), epigenetic regulation (EZH2), and growth factor receptors (FGFR2). We also identified 10 genes with recurrent somatic mutations not previously catalogued in COSMIC and validated by RNAseq, some of which involve: cytokinesis (CNTROB), metabolism (SLC13A3), NF-kappaB signaling and cell death (CARD14), tumorigenesis (KIAA1109) and neuronal regulation (TENM3). Targeted sequencing of these genes in the validation cohort (n \u003d 26) confirmed the incidence of somatic mutations in CNTROB (15%), SLC13A3 (8%), CARD14 (11%), KIAA1109 (23%) and TENM3 (23%). Conclusions: We identified genes involved in metabolism that have recurrent mutations in ALM tumor samples. These findings may support a role for targeting metabolic pathways in ALM. The highest confidence mutations have been prioritized for in vitro functional assays to test their candidacy as impactful drivers with potential for future targeted therapeutic approaches.","title":"Genomic characterization of acral lentiginous melanoma: Identification of altered metabolism as a potential therapeutic target.","pubmedId":"ASCO_164474-176"}
