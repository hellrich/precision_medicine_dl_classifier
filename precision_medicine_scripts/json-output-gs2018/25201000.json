The specific mRNA to the selected genes was analyzed by TaqMan probe-based quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The somatic oncogene mutation states of BRAF, NRAS, HRAS and KRAS were also tested.\nCYP24A1 mRNA expression was markedly increased in 52 cases (52%) of the examined papillary cancers compared with that of normal thyroid tissue. There was a tendency toward difference in the distribution of high-level CYP24A1 in the PTC accompanied with somatic oncogene mutation. Positive correlation was seen between increased CYP24A1 expression rate and a group of variables reflecting tumor malignity (mainly vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, tumor size, hypothyreosis) by principal components analysis. No significant alteration was seen in CYP27B1 gene expression between neoplastic and normal tissues.\nA definite alteration was seen in vitamin D3-inactivating CYP24A1 gene activity in PTC compared to their normal tissues on a relatively large patient population. Our findings raise the possibility that CYP24A1 may also directly be involved in thyroid carcinogenesis.","title":"Vitamin D-neutralizing CYP24A1 expression, oncogenic mutation states and histological findings of human papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"25201000"}
