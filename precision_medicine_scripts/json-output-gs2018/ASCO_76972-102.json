Various prognostic indexes such as RPA to predict survival in BM patients have been developed in patients enrolled in RTOG trials. However, they did not predict BC specific-survival with BM accurately because they had mostly included lung cancer patients. BC specific graded prognostic assessment (GPA) has been developed (Sperduto et al., IJROBP. 2010) and modified (ASCO 2010 abst. #1028) to reflect unique biologic feature of BC. The purpose of this study is to appraise and refine the Sperduto\u0027s BC-specific GPA index (S\u0027 GPA). Methods: We retrospectively investigated 272 patients with BM from BC between 1995 and 2009 at Samsung Medical Center. 173 of 272 patients who had available clinical data with ER, PR, and HER2 status were included. We appraised the S\u0027 GPA index in our cohort. Since treatment with trastuzumab significantly enhanced survival of HER2 overexpressing BC patients with BM, we refined the S\u0027 GPA index as shown in the table. Then, we validated our refined BC-specific GPA index with external patients\u0027 cohort (n\u003d140). Results: Overall median survival time (MST) for 173 patients was 9.4 months. However, Sperduto\u0027s GPA index did not predict survival of BC with BM accurately in our patients\u0027 cohort. The patients with our refined GPA scores of 0-1.0, 1.5-2.0, 2.5-3.0, and 3.5-4.0 showed significant discrimination in MST with 6.0 (n\u003d22), 8.6 (n\u003d76), 11.4 (n\u003d60), 14.1 (n\u003d15) months (p\u003d0.004), respectively. Our refined GPA index was validated with external patients\u0027 cohort at Yonsei Cancer Center. It did predict survival of BC with BM accurately in validation cohort according to refined GPA scores (pConclusions: The Sperduto\u0027s GPA index was not appraisable for predicting survival of BC with BM in the era of trastuzumab. Refining the BC specific GPA index incorporated with trastuzumab treatment is proposed to be a prognostic tool with better predictive value.The refined BC-specific GPA index.Score00.51.0KPS70-8090-100Age\u003e70No. of brain mets\u003e32-31ER/PRER -ve and PR -veER and/or PR +veHER2HER2 +ve W/O trastuzumabHER2 -veHER2 +ve with trastuzumab","title":"Prognostic index for patients with brain metastases from breast cancer: A validation and refinement of the breast-specific graded prognostic assessment (GPA) index.","pubmedId":"ASCO_76972-102"}
