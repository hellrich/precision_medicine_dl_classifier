Recent evidence demonstrated that REV3L is involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. However, the function of REV3L remains unclear in esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). In this study, we examined REV3L expression in ESCC tissues and its association with clinicopathological parameters. REV3L was found to be significantly up-regulated in ESCC tissues, which is correlated with lymph node metastasis and clinical stages of the patients. To further investigate the potential role of REV3L in esophageal cancer, stable ESCC cell lines with the suppression of REV3L expression were established. Down regulation of REV3L expression led to a decrease in cell proliferation and invasive tendency partly through suppressing cyclinD1 and survivin expression, and an increase in cellular sensitivity to 5-Fu by inducing G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, REV3L plays an important role in ESCC progression and chemoresistance, and is a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for ESCC.","title":"REV3L, the catalytic subunit of pol , is involved in the progression and chemoresistance of esophageal squamous cell cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2949"}
