In the first patient, a 48-year-old male with adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the lung and multiple bone metastases, the bone scan became completely negative following treatment with gefitinib for 9 months. The patient remained alive and with no evidence of bone metastases for 20 months, despite two local recurrences that were surgically removed. Similarly, the bone scan of the second patient, a 49-year-old male with ADC of the lung and bone metastases, became negative after 6 months on gefitinib. The molecular mechanisms potentially involved in this phenomenon are discussed.","title":"Prolonged control of bone metastases in non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib.","pubmedId":"18079016"}
