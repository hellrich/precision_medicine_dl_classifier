In the last decade, investigational approaches using clinical samples for fully human antibody production have been performed, but there are still problems with efficiency and accuracy, which should be solved. In the present study, based on novel IgG antibody-measuring ELISA and antibody gene copy number-quantitative PCR, a human single B cell RT-PCR-mediated IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) gene cloning method was established, and CMVpp65-specific human mAbs were successfully identified. Quantitative PCR for the human IgG mRNA copy number per cell demonstrated that the detection range was 10-250copies/cell. CMVpp65(+)surfaceIgG(+) B cells were collected from melanoma patients who showed high titers of serum anti-CMVpp65 IgG antibody. RT-PCR was successful in 64% (IGH) and 84% (Î²-actin) of 88 single B cells. Finally, both IGH and IGL gene amplifications in the same cell were successful in 21 single cells, and 18 IgG antibody genes specific for CMVpp65 antigen were cloned. Four of 13 recombinant human single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies showed strong responses to full-length CMVpp65 protein. These results suggested that the current fully human mAb production procedure through antibody-titer screening by ELISA, single B cell RT-PCR-based antibody gene cloning, and the making of scFv recombinant antibody is an efficient method of therapeutic antibody development.","title":"Identification of cytomegalovirus (CMV)pp65 antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies using single B cell-based antibody gene cloning from melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"20932861"}
