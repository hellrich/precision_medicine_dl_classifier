To understand mechanisms underlying death resistance in neuroblastoma cells, we developed small hairpin of RNA produced by lentiviral vectors as tools to selectively interfere with FLIP(L), a major negative regulator of death receptor-induced apoptosis. Such tools revealed highly efficient in interfering with FLIP(L) expression and function as they almost completely repressed endogenous and/or exogenously overexpressed FLIP(L) protein and fully reversed FLIP(L)-mediated TRAIL resistance. Moreover, interference with endogenous FLIP(L) and FLIP(S) significantly restored FasL sensitivity in SH-EP neuroblastoma cell line. These results reveal the ability of lentivirus-mediated shRNAs to specifically and persistently interfere with FLIP expression and support involvement of FLIP in the regulation of death receptor-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Combining such tools with other therapeutic modalities may improve treatment of resistant tumours such as neuroblastoma.","title":"Persistent inhibition of FLIP(L) expression by lentiviral small hairpin RNA delivery restores death-receptor-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells.","pubmedId":"16502263"}
