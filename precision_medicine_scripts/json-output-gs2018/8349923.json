Characteristic laboratory findings included elevated serum squamous cell carcinoma-related antigens (SCC-RAg), high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), peripheral-blood eosinophilia, and a decreased peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage. Following treatment, titers of SCC-RAg and LDH resumed normal levels with remission. In patients with senile erythroderma following eczema, serum IgE was quite high and varied but, in a few instances, was within the normal range. SCC-RAg and LDH may thus be considered useful as markers for evaluating disease conditions of the skin of patients with senile erythroderma following eczema.","title":"Significance of elevated serum squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-related antigen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in senile erythroderma following eczema.","pubmedId":"8349923"}
