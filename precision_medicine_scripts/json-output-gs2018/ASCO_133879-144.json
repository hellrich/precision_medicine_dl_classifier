Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in clinical practice could increase the change of identifying multiple molecular driver alterations calling for therapy. This study evaluates mutations in PT and sLmCRC exon2 KRAS wt patients who underwent chemotherapy (CT) containing cetuximab.  Methods:    Genomic analysis was conducted in 7 sLmCRC pts: before CT on a PT biopsy, after CT on a PT surgical specimen and all srLmCRC. A total of 54 lesions were examined. DNA libraries were generated using the Ion AmpliSeq Colon and Lung Cancer Panel including 22 mutated genes (KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT1, ERBB2, PTEN, NRAS, STK11, MAP2K1, ALK, DDR2, CTNNB1, MET, TP53, SMAD4, FBXW7, FGFR3, NOTCH1, ERBB4 , FGFR1, FGFR2) and sequenced on a Ion PGM system Results:    A partial response was achieved in all pts, with a median PFS of 11 months (4-15). Molecular analysis of genes correlated with target therapy is shown in the following table (K\u003dKRAS; N\u003dNRAS; P\u003dPIK3AC; M\u003dMET; m\u003d -; wt\u003d + ). Pt 1 showed heterogeneity in PT before and after CT with KRASm clonal selection and related expression of the mucinous pattern; in srLmCRC: 5/9 KRASm exon2, 1/9 PIK3CAm exon20, 2/9 KRASm exon2 and PIK3CA exon20. In pt 7 NRASm exon2 was identified in PT before and after CT; differences in srLmCRC: 3/5 no mutation, 1/5 NRASm exon2, 1/5 PIK3CAm exon20. The other cases showed rare mutations: SMAD4 (pt 2), TP53 (pts 2,5,6,7), FBXW7 (pt1).  Conclusions:    Our preliminary data suggest a potential role for NGS in the evaluation of biological drug resistance affecting future sequential treatments strategyCT regimenPt 1Pt 2Pt 3Pt 4Pt 5Pt 6Pt 7Folfiri/CetFolfiri/CetFolfiri/CetFolfoxiri/CetFolfiri/CetFolfiri/CetFolfoxiri/CetPFS (months)154141481110KNPMKNPMKNPMKNPMKNPMKNPMKNPMPT pre-CT-----------------+-+-----+--PT post-CT+----------------+-+-----+--srLmCRC n.1+----------------+-+-----+--srLmCRC n.2--+--------------+-+--------srLmCRC n.3+-----------------+-srLmCRC n.4+-------------------srLmCRC n.5+-------------------srLmCRC n.6+-----------srLmCRC n.7+-+---------srLmCRC n.8+-----------srLmCRC n.9+-+-----","title":"Molecular evaluation of primary tumor (PT) and synchronous liver metastasis in colorectal cancer (srLmCRC) patients after cetuximab-based chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_133879-144"}
