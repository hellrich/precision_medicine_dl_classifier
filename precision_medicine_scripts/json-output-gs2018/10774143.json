She achieved complete remission after combination chemotherapy. Two years later, she noticed a red papule on her public area without any lymph node involvement. The biopsy specimens showed diffuse proliferation of large-sized atypical lymphoid cells positive for CD30 and CD45, and negative for CD3, CD20 and CD15. These findings were mostly compatible with CD30 (Ki-1)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (Ki-1 lymphoma). Our case is considered to be cutaneous Ki-1 lymphoma preceded by Hodgkin\u0027s disease.","title":"Cutaneous CD30 (Ki-1)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma preceded by Hodgkin\u0027s disease.","pubmedId":"10774143"}
