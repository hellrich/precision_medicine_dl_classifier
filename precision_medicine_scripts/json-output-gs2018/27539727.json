MTC exhibits more aggressive behavior than follicular tumors, with the majority of cases presenting with lymph node metastasis. It is particularly common among patients carrying germline RET mutations with almost 100 % penetrance. Because activating RET mutations occur in over 90 % of hereditary and 40 % of sporadic MTC, clinical trials of several RET-targeting multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) have resulted in FDA approval of vandetanib and cabozantinib for the treatment of MTC. Nevertheless, in light of significant individual differences in tumor behavior and treatment responses, there has been a persistent need for research efforts to decipher the molecular events within RET-driven or non-RET-driven tumors. Recently, the gene regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in MTC have been studied extensively. Multiple miRNA deregulations have been discovered in MTC with potential prognostic and therapeutic implications. This review provides an overview of the basic pathology of MTC and an update on recent investigational progress.","title":"Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma: Recent Advances Including MicroRNA Expression.","pubmedId":"27539727"}
