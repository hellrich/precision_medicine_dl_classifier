All patients enrolled in a clinical trial, and 18% of patients in the compassionate access scheme underwent a baseline assessment prior to commencement of therapy and every 4-8 weeks thereafter. Patients\u0027 adverse events were recorded in a specific database.\nPatients continued to develop cutaneous adverse events after 52 weeks of continuous therapy. Patients on single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy suffered from Grover disease (45%), plantar hyperkeratosis (45%), verrucal keratosis (18%) and even cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (16%). The most frequent adverse event seen in patients in the combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor group was an acneiform eruption (40%).\nPatients on BRAF inhibitor-based therapies need to continue to have regular dermatological follow-up independent of the duration of their therapy.","title":"Cutaneous adverse events in patients treated with BRAF inhibitor-based therapies for metastatic melanoma for longer than 52 weeks.","pubmedId":"25040674"}
