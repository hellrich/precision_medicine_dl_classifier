The mammograms were blinded to six American Osteopathic Board of Radiology-certified radiologists who were asked to classify each mammogram within the five final BI-RADS categories based on the mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views presented. No history was allowed. Use of the BI-RADS five final assessment categories provided moderate interobserver objectivity, moderately high agreement among the radiologists\u0027 interpretation (reliability), and moderate accuracy of interpretation (validity) when compared to criterion. Moderate interobserver reliability and accuracy has been previously identified; however, no scientific review of the BI-RADS five final assessment categories in 40- to 49-year-old females was discovered in the current literature. No overall improvement of objectivity or accuracy was demonstrated using the five final assessment categories of the BI-RADS lexicon in 40- to 49-year-old women.","title":"Objectivity and accuracy of mammogram interpretation using the BI-RADS final assessment categories in 40- to 49-year-old women.","pubmedId":"11105450"}
