Nintedanib, ramucirumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab have to be included in the therapeutic sequences for patients affected by NSCLC, but no clear selection criteria are to date offered, except for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50 %. Performance status, smoking habits and comorbidities should be considered as clinical criteria in order to select the appropriate treatment, but also tumour characteristics as histotype, platinum resistance and rapid progression after a first-line therapy should be taken into account. The aim of the present paper is to identify subgroups of patients eligible for different therapy sequences.","title":"From 2000 to 2016: Which Second-Line Treatment in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer?","pubmedId":"27766545"}
