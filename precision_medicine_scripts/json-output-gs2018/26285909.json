Nevertheless, about 15% of APL patients still get early death or relapse. We performed this study to address the possible impact of additional gene mutations on the outcome of APL.\nWe included a consecutive series of 266 cases as training group, and then validated the results in a testing group of 269 patients to investigate the potential prognostic gene mutations, including FLT3-ITD or -TKD, N-RAS, C-KIT, NPM1, CEPBA, WT1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, MLL (fusions and PTD), IDH1, IDH2 and TET2.\nMore high-risk patients (50.4%) carried additional mutations, as compared with intermediate- and low-risk ones. The mutations of epigenetic modifier genes were associated with poor prognosis in terms of disease-free survival in both training (HR \u003d 6.761, 95% CI 2.179-20.984; P \u003d 0.001) and validation (HR \u003d 4.026, 95% CI 1.089-14.878; P \u003d 0.037) groups. Sanz risk stratification was associated with CR induction and OS.\nIn an era of ATRA/ATO treatment, both molecular markers and clinical parameter based stratification systems should be used as prognostic factors for APL.","title":"Mutations of Epigenetic Modifier Genes as a Poor Prognostic Factor in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Under Treatment With All-Trans Retinoic Acid and Arsenic Trioxide.","pubmedId":"26285909"}
