For this purpose, the clinical manifestation, signs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contents, imageology, pathological features, treatment and prognosis of 7 cases of intracranial malignant melanoma were analyzed in The Chinese PLA General Hospital (Beijing, China) from 1996 to 2013. All the melanoma cases were confirmed by histopathology, and CSF cytopathology demonstrated that there were 5 cases of primary malignant melanoma and 2 cases of secondary malignant melanoma. Among the patients, 4 presented with \u003e1 pigmented nevus in the skin, and 1 presented with skin melanoma. Intracranial malignant melanoma mostly affects middle-aged males. CSF cytopathology and imageology (particularly enhanced magnetic resonance), are important tools in the diagnosis of the disease. Particularly, when a patient presents with a pigmented nevus in the skin and an abnormal lesion in the brain, a diagnosis of intracranial malignant melanoma should be considered.","title":"Intracranial malignant melanoma: A report of 7 cases.","pubmedId":"26622814"}
