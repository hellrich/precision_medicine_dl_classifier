Elevated serum concentrations of VEGF, bFGF, and IL-8 were associated with advanced disease stages and tumor burden. Cytostatic therapy of patients was accompanied by increased serum levels of angiogenin, bFGF, and IL-8. As shown by univariate analysis, elevated serum levels of VEGF (P \u003d .0001 and .0036), bFGF (P \u003c .00005 and \u003c .00005), and IL-8 (P \u003c .00005 and \u003c .00005) were strongly correlated with a poor overall and progression-free survival, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed stage of disease (P \u003d .0238), tumor burden (P \u003d .0347), VEGF (P \u003d .0036), bFGF (P \u003d .0252), and IL-8 (P \u003d .0447) as independent predictive factors of overall survival. Tumor burden (P \u003d .0081), VEGF (P \u003d .0245), and IL-8 (P \u003d .0089) were found as independent predictive factors of progression-free survival.\nOur data suggest that the angiogenic serum factors VEGF, bFGF, and IL-8 are useful predictive markers for overall and progression-free survival in melanoma patients.","title":"Increased serum concentration of angiogenic factors in malignant melanoma patients correlates with tumor progression and survival.","pubmedId":"11208853"}
