More recently, FGFR1 amplifications were investigated using             large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism arrays in lung cancer. We hypothesized             that FGFR1 overexpression may be correlated with the clinicopathological features             of lung cancers. The increased copy number of the FGFR1 gene was analyzed by real-time             polymerase chain reaction amplifications in 100 surgically treated non-small cell             lung cancer cases from Nagoya City University Hospital. Sixty-five squamous cell             carcinoma cases were included. An increased FGFR1 gene copy number was found in             32 (32%) lung cancer patients. The increased FGFR1 copy number status significantly             correlated with gender (females 13.8% vs. males 39.4%, p\u003d0.0173), smoking status             (never smoker 4.2% vs. smoker 40.8%, p\u003d0.0004) and pathological subtypes (squamous             cell carcinoma 41.5% vs. non-squamous cell carcinoma 14.3%, p\u003d0.0066). However,             within the squamous cell carcinomas the FGFR1 copy number status did not significantly             correlate with gender, smoking status, pathological stages and differentiation             status of the lung cancers. Thus, the FGFR1 copy number is common within squamous             cell carcinoma.","title":"Increased FGFR1 copy number in lung squamous cell carcinomas.","pubmedId":"22179561"}
