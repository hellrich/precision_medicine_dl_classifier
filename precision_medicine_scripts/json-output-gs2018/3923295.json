Preoperative intensive large fractionated radiotherapy with energy regulated fast electrons was used. In the group of patients with primary melanomas, the general 5-year survival was 73.3%, for Stage T1N0M0 93.8%, in the group of patients with secondary signs of melanoma 34.8%. This method of melanoma treatment made it possible to improve 5-year results, to reduce the time of treatment, to prevent the development of local recurrences; it did not cause radiation injuries.","title":"[Intensive preoperative electron therapy in the combined treatment of melanoma of the skin].","pubmedId":"3923295"}
