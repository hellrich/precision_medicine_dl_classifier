We present a comprehensive genomic profile-based (CGP) study of UC designed to detect clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGA) that could inform the selection of established and novel targeted therapies. Methods:    DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections from 295 consecutive cases of relapsed/metastatic UC. CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 688X for 3,230 exons of 182 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. The CGP assay included base substitutions (SUB), INDELs, copy number alterations (CNA) and fusions/rearrangements. CRGA were defined as GA linked to drugs on the market or under evaluation in mechanism driven clinical trials. Results:    There were 75% male and 25% female patients with a mean age of 66 years. 295/295 (100%) of UC were high grade and advanced stage (III and IV). 294/295 (99.7%) UC had at least 1 GA on CGP with a mean of 6.4 GA/UC with 61% SUB + INDEL, 37% CNA and 2% fusions. 275 (93%) UC had at least 1 CRGA involving 75 individual genes with a mean of 2.6 CRGA/UC. The most common CRGA involved CDKN2A (34%), FGFR3 (21%), PIK3CA (20%) and ERBB2 (16%). FGFR3 GA were of diverse type and included 10% fusions. ERBB2 GA were equally divided between amplifications (CNA) and SUB. ERBB2 SUB were predominantly in the extracellular domain and were highly enriched in the micropapillary UC subgroup.  Multiple clinical antitumor responses to therapies targeting FGFR3 and ERBB2 will be presented. Conclusions:     Using a CGP assay capable of detecting all classes of GA simultaneously, an extraordinary high frequency of CRGA were identified in a large series clinically advanced UC. More than one-third of these relapsed/refractory cases of UC harbored alterations in FGFR3 and ERBB2 that are showing active responses to targeted therapies. Continued evaluation of CGP for UC and the development of genomic-based clinical trials designed to employ targeted agents potentially in combination with cytotoxic drugs for this challenging disease appears warranted.","title":"Comprehensive genomic profiling urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) to reveal frequency of clinically relevant genomic alterations.","pubmedId":"ASCO_141112-159"}
