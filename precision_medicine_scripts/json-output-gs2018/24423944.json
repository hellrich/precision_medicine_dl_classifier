Ras activation has been regarded as a negative predictive marker for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)antibody therapy for colorectal cancer. Detection of mutations in KRAS codons 12 and 13 is widely used in clinical settings. Recent studies revealed that \"minor\" activating mutations such as those in KRAS codons 61 and 146, as well as NRAS mutations, contribute to resistance. Multiplex mutation testing that includes analysis of these mutations will be clinically available in the near future. We have conducted translational research in which novel biomarker candidates were evaluated using whole-exome sequencing-based mutation profiles of anti-EGFR antibody-treated samples from multiple centers in Japan. Development of the necessary infrastructure to ensure that genetic testing data are properly handled and utilized in clinical settings is also an important issue for the realization of cancer precision medicine. We have conducted pilot studies at the National Cancer Center in Japan.
