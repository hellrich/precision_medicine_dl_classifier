The data were analyzed in April 2015.\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of FOLFOX4 or FOLFOX4 plus cetuximab after surgical resection for stage III colon cancer.\nAssociations between these biomarkers and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models. Multivariate models were adjusted for covariates (age, sex, tumor grade, T/N stage, tumor location, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status).\nAmong the 2559 patients enrolled in the PETACC-8 trial (42.9% female; median [range] age, 60.0 [19.0-75.0] years), microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype, KRAS, and BRAF V600E mutations were detected in, respectively, 9.9% (177 of 1791), 33.1% (588 of 1776), and 9.0% (148 of 1643) of cases. In multivariate analysis, MSI (hazard ratio [HR] for DFS: 1.10 [95% CI, 0.73-1.64], P \u003d .67; HR for OS: 1.02 [95% CI, 0.61-1.69], P \u003d .94) and BRAF V600E mutation (HR for DFS: 1.22 [95% CI, 0.81-1.85], P \u003d .34; HR for OS: 1.13 [95% CI, 0.64-2.00], P \u003d .66) were not prognostic, whereas KRAS mutation was significantly associated with shorter DFS (HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.23-1.95]; P \u003c .001) and OS (HR, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.12-2.15]; P \u003d .008). The subgroup analysis showed in patients with microsatellite-stable tumors that both KRAS (HR for DFS: 1.64 [95% CI, 1.29-2.08], P \u003c .001; HR for OS: 1.71 [95% CI, 1.21-2.41], P \u003d .002) and BRAF V600E mutation (HR for DFS: 1.74 [95% CI, 1.14-2.69], P \u003d .01; HR for OS: 1.84 [95% CI, 1.01-3.36], P \u003d .046) were independently associated with worse clinical outcomes. In patients with MSI tumors, KRAS status was not prognostic, whereas BRAF V600E mutation was associated with significantly longer DFS (HR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.06-0.92]; P \u003d .04) but not OS (HR, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.03-1.24]; P \u003d .08).\nBRAF V600E and KRAS mutations were significantly associated with shorter DFS and OS in patients with microsatellite-stable tumors but not in patients with MSI tumors. Future trials in the adjuvant setting will have to take into account mismatch repair, BRAF, and KRAS status for stratification.\nEudraCT 2005-003463-23.","title":"Prognostic Effect of BRAF and KRAS Mutations in Patients With Stage III Colon Cancer Treated With Leucovorin, Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin With or Without Cetuximab: A Post Hoc Analysis of the PETACC-8 Trial.","pubmedId":"26768652"}
