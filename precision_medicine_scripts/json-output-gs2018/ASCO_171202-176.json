Atezo does not inhibit the interaction of an alternative ligand PD-L2 with PD-1. PD-L2 is associated with Th2 immune responses but its role in anticancer immunity is unclear. Here we characterize the association between these ligands and patient (pt) outcome following atezo treatment across tumor types. Methods: Expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 transcripts in tumor specimens from pts before starting atezo treatment was assessed using Fluidigm platform or RNAseq. Pts from PCD4989g (melanoma, n \u003d 38; RCC, n \u003d 59), POPLAR (NSCLC, n \u003d 112) and cohort 2 of IMvigor210 (urothelial carcinoma [UC], n \u003d 251) trials were included in the analysis. Results: A close Spearman correlation was observed for PD-L1 and PD-L2 transcripts in melanoma (0.8), UC (0.77), NSCLC (0.74) but less so in RCC (0.43). Overall survival HRs and odds ratios (ORs) of being a responder using the median expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 across 4 cancer types are listed (Table). High expression of either ligand in these tumors was associated with improved OS benefit to atezo treatment. Neither ligand had an association with OS benefit of docetaxel (doc) in NSCLC pts. OS HR of PD-L2 high in the randomized trial (POPLAR) of atezo vs doc was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.31-0.83), favoring atezo. Conclusions: Clinical outcomes in 4 distinct cancer types showed that high expression of PD-L2 was associated with improved benefit of atezo therapy.These data show that blocking the PD-L1:PD-1 and PD-L2:B7.1 axes but not PD-L2: PD-1 axis is highly efficacious in PD-L2 high pts. Further evidence is required to understand the role of PD-L2 in cancer.
