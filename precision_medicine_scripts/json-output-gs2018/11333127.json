Gout and acute infection were excluded, and an autoimmune aetiology or occult metastasis were considered. The arthritis initially subsided with indomethacin, but the symptoms recurred 2 months later, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated metastatic melanoma of the left talus. Immunohistochemical staining of a cerebral metastatic deposit biopsied 1 week after the onset of arthritis demonstrated T-cell and macrophage infiltration of the tumour. In addition, the patient developed melanoma-specific delayed type hypersensitivity and cytotoxic T-cell responses after vaccination. Thus, the monoarthritis represented an \u0027appropriate\u0027 inflammatory response directed against metastatic melanoma.","title":"Metastatic lesions in the joint associated with acute inflammatory arthritis after dendritic cell immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"11333127"}
