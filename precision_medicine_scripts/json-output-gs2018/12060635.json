Expression of MMAC/PTEN inhibited the in vitro growth of PC3 cells primarily by blocking cell cycle progression. Ex vivo introduction of MMAC/PTEN expression did not inhibit the tumorigenicity of orthotopically implanted PC3 cells, but it did significantly reduce tumor size and completely inhibited the formation of metastases. In vivo treatment of pre-established orthotopic PC3 tumors with adenoviral MMAC/PTEN did not significantly reduce local tumor size, but it did diminish metastasis formation.\nMMAC/PTEN functionally regulates prostate cancer cell metastatic potential in an in vivo model system and may be an important biological marker and therapeutic target for human prostate cancer.","title":"Adenoviral-mediated expression of MMAC/PTEN inhibits proliferation and metastasis of human prostate cancer cells.","pubmedId":"12060635"}
