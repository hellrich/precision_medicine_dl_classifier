We thus predicted a clinical benefit of gefitinib against the 12% of primary colorectal cancers exhibiting a mutation reflective of this potential distinctive susceptibility.\nThe mutation status of the kinase domain in EGFR in different primary cancers has important clinical consequences, because the presence of a mutation is recognized as a reliable indicator for the effectiveness of gefitinib administration. In the current study, we investigated the presence of somatic mutations in exons 18-21 coding the ATP-binding domain in five gastric cancer cell lines and 39 primary gastric cancers and their corresponding normal tissues.\nThe kinase domain of EGFR is highly conserved in whole gastric cancer cell lines and cases, therefore treatment with gefitinib is unfortunately not recommended for such malignancy.","title":"The epidermal growth factor receptor gene sequence is highly conserved in primary gastric cancers.","pubmedId":"16353180"}
