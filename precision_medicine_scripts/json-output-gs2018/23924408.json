We report a case of a patient undergoing BRAF inhibition therapy for disseminated melanoma with a V600E mutation who developed bilateral areolar leiomyomas, one of which was biopsied and the other of which resolved after discontinuation of vemurafenib therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a mesenchymal neoplasm developing in association with BRAF inhibition therapy.
