Each clone displayed a peculiar cytolytic activity ranging from lysis of most targets (PBL clone 4C4) to preferential reactivity on the two autologous metastases (TIL clone 8B3). Blocking and modulation experiments, revealed that the lysis of autologous-Tu cells by TIL clone 8B3, but not by PBL clone 4C4, could be inhibited by mAb to HLA-class I and to CD3 Ag or by CD3 complex modulation. Clone 8B3 was tested also on a panel of 25 tumor clones from Me665/2, revealing that only 4 neoplastic clones were lysed (2/4, 2/14, 2/17, and 2/51). Cold target competition experiments indicated that the uncloned autologous melanomas and one tumor clone (2/17), but no two other tumor clones (2/10, 2/15), could compete with one another for lysis by 8B3. Determination of melanin content of tumor clones from Me665/2 revealed that the four neoplastic clones recognized by 8B3 possessed much lower melanin levels than all the other 20 clones not lysed by this effector.","title":"Cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones from peripheral blood and from tumor site detect intratumor heterogeneity of melanoma cells.
