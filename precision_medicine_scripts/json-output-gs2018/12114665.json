The former setting usually affects middle-aged females; the latter is typical of familial adenomatous polyposis. We report the case of a 69-yr-old man in whom two abdominal masses had been instrumentally detected following an access of abdominal pain. Save for a moderate hypertension, he was asymptomatic and an impalpable thyroid nodule was detected by ultrasonography. A high urinary noradrenaline output and cytology of the masses raised the suspicion of pheochromocytoma. At laparotomy, an adrenal pheochromocytoma and a paracaval paraganglioma were excised. Subsequently, hemithyroidectomy was performed, and histopathology revealed papillary microcarcinoma. A nodule of desmoid tumor was also removed from the abdominal wall. An analysis of RET, APC, and TP53 gene mutations, and of RET and NTRK1 gene rearrangements, yielded negative results. No in vitro transforming activity was detected in the tumor DNA when assayed in transfection experiments. The lack of a consistent family history also made unlikely the possibility of identifying the putative germline defect by linkage analyses. Should this unusual aggregation of tumors represent a new entity, a number of genetic alterations have now been excluded.","title":"Concurrent Pheochromocytoma, Paraganglioma, Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma, and Desmoid Tumor: A Case Report with Analyses at the Molecular Level.","pubmedId":"12114665"}
