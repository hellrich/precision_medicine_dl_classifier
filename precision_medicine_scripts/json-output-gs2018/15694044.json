This study was to detect expressions of EGFR and E-cadherin in esophageal carcinoma, and to analyze their relationship.\nExpressions of EGFR and E-cadherin in 50 specimens of esophageal squamous carcinoma and 8 specimens of esophageal adenocarcinoma were detected by immunohistochemistry.\nPositive rates of EGFR, and E-cadherin in esophageal squamous carcinoma were 72.0% (36/50), and 22.0% (11/50); while those in esophageal adenocarcinoma were 75.0% (6/8), and 25% (2/8). Positive rates of EGFR in esophageal squamous carcinoma of grades I, II, and III were 63.6%, 75.0%, and 81.3%, respectively. The expression of EGFR negatively correlated with that of E-cadherin (r\u003d-0.341, P\u003d0.008).\nThe expression of EGFR in esophageal carcinoma is increased, while that of E-cadherin is decreased;down-regulation of E-cadherin may be associated with up-regulation of EGFR.","title":"[Expressions of epithelial growth factor receptor and E-cadherin in esophageal carcinoma and their correlation].","pubmedId":"15694044"}
