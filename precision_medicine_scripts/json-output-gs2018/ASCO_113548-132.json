Increased PD-L1 expression has been reported with various hematologic malignancies and may prevent the host immune response from exerting an antitumor effect on the malignant cells. Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 monoclonal PD-1 receptor blocking antibody, has demonstrated antitumor activity in pts with solid tumors including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung carcinoma. We hypothesized that nivolumab could also mediate antitumor activity in pts with hematologic malignancies, a significant area of unmet medical need. We describe a phase I study to evaluate the effects of nivolumab in pts with select hematologic malignancies.  Methods:  This open-label, two-part study will enroll approximately 100 pts. During dose escalation, successive cohorts of pts with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies will be treated using a 6+3 escalation design. Pts will receive 1 or 3 mg/kg nivolumab IV every 2 weeks (wks) (the first dose will be followed by a 3-wk evaluation period), for 2 years, with the potential for an additional year of therapy for pts who progress during the follow-up period. Subsequently, 5 tumor-specific cohorts of 16 pts will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for multiple myeloma, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma/primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Response will be assessed at wks 4, 8, 16, 24, and every 16 wks thereafter. The primary study objective is to establish dose limiting toxicities, the MTD, and the recommended phase II nivolumab dose. Secondary objectives are to characterize nivolumab pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, preliminary antitumor activity, and the potential association between PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and clinical efficacy. Exploratory objectives include investigation of the immunoregulatory effects of nivolumab in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and/or tumor. Pts are currently being enrolled at 3 mg/kg.
