We have generated several independent lines of human NPM-ALK transgenic mice using the haematopoietic cell-specific Vav promoter. Lymphomas develop in two transgenic lines in which the Vav promoter regulates NPM-ALK expression. The transgenic line with higher copy number displays an early-onset phenotype in which all mice succumb to aggressive lymph node tumours with intestinal involvement, whereas the second line displays late-onset tumour development in the spleen and/or liver. Lymphomas from both lines are phenotypically distinct and display B-lineage characteristics with aberrant coexpression of myeloid markers. The NPM-ALK kinase is active in primary tumour tissue and forms a multimeric complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, that is, Shc. Jun and ERK kinase activities in tumours are elevated by up to 30-fold and fivefold, respectively, in comparison with sIgM-stimulated primary B cells. The new transgenic models provide a system for investigating the oncogenic events mediated by NPM-ALK in situ and a physiologically relevant context for developing tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies of potential use in the clinic.","title":"Vav-promoter regulated oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK in transgenic mice causes B-cell lymphomas with hyperactive Jun kinase.","pubmedId":"14586401"}
