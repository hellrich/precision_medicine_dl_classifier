Case 1 was a 63-year-old male admitted for dyspnea due to stenotic trachea with primary lung cancer invasion. YAG-laser operation and Dynamic stent was inserted to the trachea using PCPS. Case 2 was a 74-year-old male admitted for dyspnea due to stenotic right mein bronchus with primary lung cancer invasion. Dumon Y stent was inserted to the right mein bronchus using PCPS. Case 3 was 57-year-old male admitted for dyspnea due to stenotic trachea and occluded left mein bronchus with ischemic change after primary esophageal cancer operation. Dynamic stent was inserted to the trachea and left mein bronchus using PCPS. Tracheal and mein bronchus stenoses the trachea of all was dilated after placement of stent. These three cases had no complications during or after these treatment. These results indicated that using PCPS was a very useful, powerful and satisfactory method in the treatment of tracheal or mein bronchus stenoses during the lack of lung ventilation.","title":"[Clinical experience using percutaneous cardiopulmonary support system for stent replacement].","pubmedId":"10667020"}
