As early as 2002, the majority of metastatic melanomas were described to harbor the BRAF(V600) mutation, setting the stage for an explosion of interest for targeting this protein as a novel therapeutic strategy. The highly selective BRAF(V600) inhibitor, vemurafenib, was identified initially through a large-scale drug screen.\nHere we examine vemurafenib\u0027s journey from discovery to clinical use in metastatic melanoma. Topics covered include preclinical data, single agent Phase 1,2 and 3 clinical trials, resistance issues and mechanisms, adverse effects including the development of squamous cell cancers, and combination trials.\nDue to its tolerance, low toxicity profile, rapid tumor response, and improved outcomes in melanoma patients with BRAF(V600) mutations, vemurafenib was advanced rapidly through clinical trials to receive FDA approval in 2011. While its efficacy is well documented, durability has become an issue for most patients who experience therapeutic resistance in approximately 6-8 months. In addition, a concerning toxicity observed in patients taking the drug include development of localized cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). It is hypothesized that drug resistance and SCC development result from a similar paradoxical activation of protein signaling pathways, specifically MAPK. Identification of these mechanisms has led to additional treatment strategies involving new combination therapies.","title":"The discovery of vemurafenib for the treatment of BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"27327499"}
