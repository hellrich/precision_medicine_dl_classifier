A 62 year-old female patient was diagnosed with a plantar melanoma and was managed with resection and regional lymphadenectomy. Eight months later, a solitary liver metastasis was diagnosed and a right hepatectomy performed. Sixteen months later, a recurrent solitary metastasis was diagnosed in the caudate lobe and resection was performed. She has since been asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence of the disease at a 2-year follow up. We recommend surgical removal of hepatic metastatic melanoma in selected cases where the disease is confined to the liver and surgery can be performed without unacceptable risk.","title":"Repeat hepatic resection for recurrent metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"10228842"}
