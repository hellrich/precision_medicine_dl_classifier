The expression level of the extracellular matrix molecule biglycan (Bgn) has been linked to poor prognosis in several cancer entities, but its functional role in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. Methods:Bgn-/- and Bgn+/+ mice were injected with two melanoma cell lines and tumor growth and survival were monitored. Contraction of collagen by fibroblasts derived from Bgn+/+ or Bgn-/- mice, as well as tumor cell migration in the Bgn+/+ or Bgn-/- collagen matrices were quantified. Analysis of the matrix stiffness was performed by atomic force microscopy and collagen bundle formation was evaluated using picrosirius red staining. Expression level of integrin-1 (Itgb1) was measured in the cells isolated from Bgn-/- and Bgn+/+ matrices. Both Bgn-/- and Bgn+/+mice were injected with Itgb1 overexpressing B16 melanoma cells and survival was monitored. Immunohistochemistry staining of human melanoma samples was performed to analyze Bgn and Itgb1 expression. Results: We observed reduced melanoma growth and tumor-related death in Bgn-/- mice compared to Bgn+/+ mice in two melanoma models. Absence of biglycan in the collagen-derived matrices led to delayed contraction and diminished melanoma cell invasion into these matrices. Reduced tissue stiffnes, as measured by atomic force microscopy and diminished collagen bundle formation were observed in Bgn-/-matrices. Cell isolation from the stiffer Bgn+/+ collagen matrices revealed a higher Itgb1 expression compared to the Bgn-/- matrices. Overexpression of Itgb1 in B16-melanoma cells rescued the delayed tumor growth-phenotype of Bgn-/- mice leading to a survival comparable to that of Bgn+/+ mice. In humans, high Bgn expression correlated with poor prognosis and low overall and progression-free survival of the patients. In agreement with the mouse and in vitro studies, Bgn-expression in human melanoma samples positively correlated with the expression of Itgb1. Conclusions: This study describes a novel role of Bgn in the melanoma microenvironment, regulating the tissue stiffness and Itgb1 expression in both mice and humans.","title":"Effect of biglycan on melanoma invasiveness via increased tissue stiffness and integrin-1 expression.","pubmedId":"ASCO_169447-176"}
