The first was classified as malignant melanoma in situ, pagetoid type; the second as malignant melanoma, dendritic type; and the third as nodular malignant melanoma. These cases led the authors to compare the histopathologic features of malignant melanomas of the oral cavity with those of malignant melanomas of the skin and, finding them much the same, to advise early biopsies of all pigmented lesions in the oral cavity.","title":"Malignant melanoma of the oral cavity.","pubmedId":"7229180"}
