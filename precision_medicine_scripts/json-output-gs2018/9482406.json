We then illustrate how these molecular alterations may be used to alter therapy.\nIn childhood ALL, the TEL-AML1 fusion and hyperdiploidy are both associated with excellent treatment outcomes and therefore identify patients who may be candidates for less intensive therapy. In contrast, MLL gene rearrangements and the BCR-ABL fusion confer a poor prognosis; these patients may be best treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in first remission.\nAlthough clinical features are important prognostic indicators, genetic alterations of leukemic blasts may be better predictors of outcome for acute leukemia patients. We therefore favor risk-adapted therapy based on classification schemes that incorporate both genetic and clinical features.","title":"Molecular genetics of childhood leukemias.","pubmedId":"9482406"}
