As such, co-targeting ErbB1 and ErbB2 with lapatinib in combination with hormonal therapy is an attractive approach to enhance the efficacy of either tamoxifen or estrogen deprivation. As demonstrated in the EGF30008 trial, a combined targeted strategy with letrozole and lapatinib significantly increased progression-free survival and clinical benefit rates in patients with metastatic breast cancer that co-expresses ER and ErbB2. Therefore, women who are not in an acutely life-threatening situation should be considered for upfront treatment with hormonal therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibitors) in combination with an anti-ErbB2 therapy.","title":"Lapatinib in the Treatment of Hormone Receptor-Positive/ErbB2-Positive Breast Cancer.","pubmedId":"20847831"}
