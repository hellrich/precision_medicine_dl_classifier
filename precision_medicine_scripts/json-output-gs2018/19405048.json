Low expression levels of the Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD2) enzyme have been reported in cancer patients. Genetic variation in the regulatory regions of the SOD2 gene may increase the risk of cancer. We identified a genetic variation (G1677T, rs2Y758Y339) in the vicinity of the enhancer region located in intron 2 of the SOD2 gene that creates a potential glucocorticoid responsive element, and developed an assay to screen DNA samples of 220 individuals (73 control, 59 prostate cancer survival individuals and 88 lung cancer biopsies). There were no significant differences in the genotype frequency distribution among prostate, lung cancer and control (p \u003d 0.074 and 0.057, respectively). However, we identified an association of T allele with a decreased risk of lung cancer (OR \u003d 0.525, p \u003d 0.037). The use of the G1677T polymorphism of SOD2 gene as a genetic risk marker may suggest new approaches for detection, prevention, treatment, and prognosis of cancer.","title":"Association of a new intronic polymorphism of the SOD2 gene (G1677T) with cancer.","pubmedId":"19405048"}
