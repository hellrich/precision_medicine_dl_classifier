The mainstay of treatment is usually surgical with curative or palliative intent, since radio- and chemotherapy do not really improve the outcome. The poor prognosis is attributable to delay in diagnosis and its inherent biologic aggressiveness.\nWe present a case of anorectal melanoma in a 68-year-old man who underwent solely abdominoperineal amputation and was doing well 30 months after surgery, without any evidence of recurrent disease.\nTreatment of anorectal melanoma should be by the least morbid means possible. Surgical procedure that can achieve a complete local excision and respect the functional aspects and quality of life of the patient remains the best therapeutic approach. No systemic regimen for metastatic anorectal melanoma is considered standard of care.","title":"Primary anorectal melanoma: A case report with extended follow-up.","pubmedId":"23569542"}
