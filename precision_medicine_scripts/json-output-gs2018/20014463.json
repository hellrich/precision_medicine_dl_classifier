Of these, 429 (8.1%) patients were diagnosed with ICC, and their clinicopathological, surgical, and survival characteristics were analyzed.\nUpper abdominal discomfort or pain (65.0%), no symptoms (12.1%), and hypodynamia (8.2%) were the major causes for medical attention. Laboratory tests showed 198 (46.4%) patients were HBsAg positive, 90 (21.3%) had alpha-fetoprotein \u003e 20 microg/L, 50 (11.9%) carcinoembryonic antigen \u003e 10 microg/L, and 242 (57.5%) carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) \u003e 37 U/mL. Survival data was available for 329 (76.7%) patients and their mean survival time was 12.4 mo. The overall survival of the patients with R0, R1 resection and punching exploration were 18.3, 6.6 and 5.6 mo, respectively. Additionally, CA19-9 \u003e 37 U/mL was associated with lymph node metastases, but inversely associated with cirrhosis. Multivariate analysis indicated that radical resection, lymph node metastases, macroscopic tumor thrombi and size, and CA19-9 were associated with prognosis.\nSurgical radical resection is still the most effective means to cure ICC. Certain laboratory tests (such as CA19-9) can effectively predict the survival of the patients with ICC.","title":"Clinicopathological and prognostic analysis of 429 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20014463"}
