This type of mixed cerebral tumor is histologically characterized by a peripheral distribution of the gliomatous elements in relation to a more centrally situated meningeal or intracerebral sarcoma, and by the frequent presence of gradual transitions from reactive to frankly neoplastic astrocytes. In six of the eight cases, the additional development of either infiltrating astrocytoma or frank glioblastoma in the adjacent brain was demonstrated; this was interpreted as a further expression of malignant glial reaction. It is suggested that these tumors be termed \"sarcogliomas\" to distinguish them from the type of mixed glioma and sarcoma that has recently been redesignated \"gliosarcoma.\"","title":"Reactive glioma in intracranial sarcoma: a form of mixed sarcoma and glioma (\"sarcoglioma\"): report of eight cases.","pubmedId":"216476"}
