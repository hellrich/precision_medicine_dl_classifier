BATTLE was a randomized, biopsy-driven clinical study in patients with metastatic NSCLC previously treated with systemic therapy. Fresh biopsies were obtained at the time of enrollment for biomarker evaluation. We hypothesized that molecular abnormalities found at the time of enrolment in BATTLE would differ from baseline, pre-chemotherapy, diagnostic tissue.    Methods: We isolated DNA (SPRI-TE-based DNA recovery and cleanup methodology) from 82 matched pre-chemotherapy and BATTLE formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. Mutations were assessed by MALDI-TOF MS (MassArray, Sequenom Inc) using a lung cancer panel of 16 genes/140 assays (AKT1, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR3, HRAS, KRAS, MEK1, MEK2, MET, NRAS, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN, and STK11) and were compared between pre-chemotherapy versus BATTLE samples.  Results: Mutations were identified in 25 pre-chemotherapy samples (14 K-RAS, 5 EGFR, 3 PIK3CA, 1 STK11, 1 PTEN, 1 HRAS, 1 CTNNB1). Conversely, 29 BATTLE samples had at least one mutation (14 K-RAS, 7 EGFR, 5 PIK3CA, 2 STK11, 1 PTEN, 1 HRAS, 1 CTNNB1). For the matched pair analysis, 46 patients had wild-type tumors both in pre-chemotherapy and BATTLE samples. 11 patients had wild-type tumors in pre-chemotherapy samples, but had a mutation identified in BATTLE samples (4 K-RAS, 4 EGFR,  2 PIK3CA, 1 STK11). 7 patients had a mutation in pre-chemotherapy samples, but no mutations in BATTLE samples (4 K-RAS, 2 EGFR, 1 HRAS). The remaining 18 patients had mutations in both the pre-chemotherapy and BATTLE samples; of these, 2 had different mutations in the paired samples (both within the same genes, 1 KRAS, 1 PIK3CA). Overall, there was a 24% gene mutation discordance rate between pre-chemotherapy and BATTLE samples.  Conclusions: Profiling of fresh biopsies may more accurately reflect molecular abnormalities present in the tumor at the time of initiation of salvage therapy, underscoring the importance of real time tissue collection in biomarker-driven studies in this setting (V Foundation, DoD).","title":"Differences in mutation patterns of diagnostic versus post-chemotherapy samples in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_114230-132"}
