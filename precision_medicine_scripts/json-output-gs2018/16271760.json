Therefore, we speculated that there is an inverse relationship between these two factors. To clarify this, we measured the expression level of Flt3 and PU.1 in 24 primary AML specimens. As a result, there is a significant negative correlation between Flt3 and PU.1 (r\u003d-0.43, p\u003c0.05). Furthermore, we revealed that flt3 gene promoter is suppressed by the over-expression of PU.1, suggesting that PU.1 is a potential suppressor of flt3 gene promoter.","title":"Inverse correlation between Flt3 and PU.1 expression in acute myeloblastic leukemias.","pubmedId":"16271760"}
