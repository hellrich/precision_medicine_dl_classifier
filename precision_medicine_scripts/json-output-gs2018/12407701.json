This report reviews the cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic, and molecular genetic abnormalities associated with diffuse infiltrating astrocytomas in adults. This group of tumors is subdivided into low-grade astrocytomas (WHO grade II), anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III), and glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV).","title":"Genetic alterations associated with adult diffuse astrocytic tumors.","pubmedId":"12407701"}
