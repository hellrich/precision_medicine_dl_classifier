Here we present the molecular mechanisms of this interaction. The region of the nm23-h-prune interaction lies between S120 and S125 of nm23, where missense mutants show impaired binding; this region has been highly conserved throughout evolution, and can undergo serine phosphorylation by casein kinase I. Thus, the casein kinase I delta-epsilon specific inhibitor IC261 impairs the formation of the nm23-h-prune complex, which translates \u0027in vitro\u0027 into inhibition of cellular motility in a breast cancer cellular model. A competitive permeable peptide containing the region for phosphorylation by casein kinase I impairs cellular motility to the same extent as IC261. The identification of these two modes of inhibition of formation of the nm23-H1-h-prune protein complex pave the way toward new challenges, including translational studies using IC261 or this competitive peptide \u0027in vivo\u0027 to inhibit cellular motility induced by nm23-H1-h-prune complex formation during progression of breast cancer.","title":"Phosphorylation of nm23-H1 by CKI induces its complex formation with h-prune and promotes cell motility.","pubmedId":"17906697"}
