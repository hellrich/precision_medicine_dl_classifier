Tumor samples were collected from 98 patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma stage II treated with primary surgery. We have observed a strong correlation between VEGF-A and c-met. No correlations were found between VEGF-A or HGFR expressions and clinical parameters (tumor size, grade, axillary lymph node status, age), 5- and 10-years DFS or OS. Our study did not reveal any prognostic value of c-met or VEGF. In addition they are not useful to separate a patients\u0027 subgroup with poor prognosis. Unlike in other authors\u0027 studies, our patients\u0027 group is very homogenous which might tribute to obtained results.","title":"Correlation between hepatocyte growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor-A in breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20529820"}
