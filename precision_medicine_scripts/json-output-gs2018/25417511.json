Emphysematous urinary tract infections occur mainly in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or an obstructed urinary tract. Here we present a case of concomitant emphysematous prostatic and periurethral abscesses caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 70-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Given the high prevalence of patients with diabetes mellitus and the high mortality rate associated with emphysematous prostatic abscesses, clinicians should be aware of this rare but potentially fatal condition.","title":"Concomitant emphysematous prostatic and periurethral abscesses due to Klebsiella pneumoniae: a case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"25417511"}
