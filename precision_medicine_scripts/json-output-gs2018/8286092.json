Lesions were classified as lentigo simplex, congenital nevus, \"common\" nevus, dysplastic nevus, blue nevus, Spitz\u0027s nevus or malignant melanoma. A comparison of the two periods reveals an increase in dysplastic nevi from one in 1980 to nine in 1989. The histologic changes in these nevi were compared to those of the other tumors. Pronounced cytologic atypia was seen in the melanocytes of a few \"common\" nevi, but more often in the dysplastic nevi and in all of the melanomas. Slight nuclear atypia was usual in \"common\" nevi and lentigines, and also fibroplasia, lymphocytic infiltration, vessel proliferation and pigment incontinence were seen in both \"common\" nevi and dysplastic nevi. It is concluded that no single histologic variable was specific for dysplastic nevi.","title":"Melanocytic lesions in a private pathology practice.
