Methods: Weretrospectively reviewed clinical outcomes of 160 consecutive metastatic melanoma patients (pts) treated in the Dept of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics (Phase I program) at M. D. Anderson since 2008, and compared their median progression free survival (PFS) to their first and last standard systemic therapy PFS. In addition, we compared those pts outcomes tested for tumor molecular aberrations on a phase I trial with a matched targeted agent with those of pts who were treated without regard for their molecular profiles. Results: Of 160 pts treated on 35 different phase 1 clinical trials, 110 pts (69%) had  1 molecular aberration. Of those pts who had adequate tissue for molecular analysis, 63% (85/134) pts had BRAF mutation, 20% (22/109) NRAS mutation, 20% (1/5) GNAQ mutation, 11% (1/9) P53 mutation, 2.5% (1/39) PIK3CA and 1.3% (1/76) had KIT mutation. 77 (48%) pts were treated on a phase I trial with a matched targeted agent and 83 (52%) pts were treated on a non-matched phase 1 trial. The overall response rate was 39% (complete response [CR], 9%; partial response [PR], 30%) in the 77 pts treated with matched therapy and 9% (all PRs) in the 83 pts treated without matched therapy (P \u003d 0.0018). 139 (87%) pts received at least one systemic therapy before referral to phase I, median PFS was longer on phase 1 therapy than on last line standard therapy prior to referral to phase 1 (4.2 vs. 2.8 months, P \u003d 0.002). Median PFS was greater for pts on matched vs. non-matched therapy (5.3 vs. 3.7 months, log rank P \u003d 0.004). Also, median PFS was longer on phase 1 matched trial than on first standard treatment (5.3 vs. 3.9 months, log rank P \u003d 0.045).PFS did not differ between first standard and non-matched phase 1 study. Univariate analyses with the log rank test revealed that matched therapy (P \u003d 0.004) was positively associated with longer PFS on phase I clinical trials. Conclusions: Matching melanoma pts with targeted drugsbased on specific molecular aberrations in the phase I setting can be associated with superior outcomes compared to prior standard systemic therapies.","title":"Targeted agents matched with tumor molecular aberrations: Review of 160 patients with advanced melanoma treated in a phase I clinic.","pubmedId":"ASCO_95941-114"}
