Seven out of 11 (64%) common naevi and three out of nine (33%) dysplastic naevi showed increased cytoplasmic N-ras expression. No p53 immunopositivity could be recognized in any of the naevus samples. However, strong N-ras expression as well as immunopositivity for p53 was recognized among primary melanomas and metastases with significantly higher frequency among samples from patients with HCMM compared with samples from SCMM cases (for N-ras, 40% vs 10%, P \u003c 0.01; and for p53 43% vs 17%, P \u003c 0.05). We have earlier registered N-ras codon 61 mutations among metastases from 59% of patients with HCMM and from 24% of subjects with SCMM. A comparison of the genetic data with the immunohistochemical results showed occurrence of increased N-ras p21 expression in the presence and absence of detectable N-ras mutant alleles. Increased expression of wildtype N-ras p21 may contribute to tumorigenicity in the absence of mutational activation, at least in a subset of melanomas. Altogether, N-ras p21 alterations are registered at earlier stages than p53 alterations in melanoma development and may be of aetiological importance, whereas p53 alterations may be associated with tumour progression in the late stages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Immunohistochemical analysis of the N-ras p21 and the p53 proteins in naevi, primary tumours and metastases of human cutaneous malignant melanoma: increased immunopositivity in hereditary melanoma.","pubmedId":"7620336"}
