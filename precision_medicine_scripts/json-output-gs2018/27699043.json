The aim of this study was to analyse the toxicity produced by BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The most common toxicities were similar to those published in clinical trials, particularly arthralgia, alopecia and photosensitivity in the vemurafenib group; asthenia, hyperkeratosis and dry skin in the dabrafenib group; and diarrhoea and dry skin in the dabrafenib plus trametinib group. Toxicities that had not been described in clinical trials were also identified. Thus, the present study confirmed that the results obtained in clinical trials are similar to those obtained in clinical practice.","title":"Comparative safety of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib and trametinib) in first-line therapy for BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"27699043"}
