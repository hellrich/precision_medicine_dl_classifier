At the same time, all were tested using Sinofiler kit, Identifiler kit and PowerPlex 16 kit respectively for comparison. The genotypes were compared at the same STR loci among these four kits to test the sensitivity and accuracy of Expressmarker 22 STR loci direct PCR amplification kit.\n97.79% samples were successfully typed using Expressmarker 22 STR loci direct PCR amplification kit. The genotype profiles of the same samples using Expressmarker 22 STR loci direct PCR amplification kit were consistent with Sinofiler kit, Identifiler kit and PowerPlex 16 kit at the same STR loci.\nExpressmarker 22 STR loci direct PCR amplification kit can provide huge information and accurate results","title":"[Forensic application of expressmarker 22 STR loci direct PCR amplification kit].","pubmedId":"23484329"}
