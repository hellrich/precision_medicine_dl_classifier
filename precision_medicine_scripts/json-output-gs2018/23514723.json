The relationship between ROS1 fusions and clinicopathological features and the prognostic effect of the ROS1 fusion status on survival were analyzed.\nIn this study, 8 of 392 (2.0%) evaluable samples were found to harbor ROS1 fusions. Of the ROS1-positive patients, seven presented with adenocarcinoma, and one with adenosquamous carcinoma. The ratio of female to male and never smoker to smokers in a ROS1 fusion-positive group was 5:3. There was no statistically significant difference in age, sex, smoking history, histological type and pathological stage between ROS1 fusion-positive and ROS1 fusion-negative patients. ROS1 fusion-negative patients had a significantly longer survival when compared with ROS1 fusion-positive patients (P \u003d 0.041). Lower pathological stage, younger age and ROS1 fusion-negative status were significantly associated with better prognosis on multivariate analysis.\nROS1 fusions occurred in âˆ¼2.0% of Chinese patients with NSCLC and had no specific clinicopathological feature. ROS1 fusion-negative patients may have a better survival than ROS1 fusion-positive patients.","title":"ROS1 fusions in Chinese patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23514723"}
