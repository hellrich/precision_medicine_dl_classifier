It is known to be rarely observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic crisis transformed from chronic myelogenous leukemia. We herein describe a 26-year-old female patient with precursor B-cell ALL, cytogenetically characterized by ider(9)(q10)t(9;22). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed two ABL-BCR fusion signals on the derivative chromosome 9 and one BCR-ABL fusion signal on the derivative chromosome 22. Although a t(9;22) and a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 9 are known to be associated with a poor prognostic factor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a larger study is needed to determine the prognosis of ider(9)(q10)t(9;22) cases.","title":"[A Case of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with ider(9)(q10)t(9;22)(q34;q11.2).].","pubmedId":"18156729"}
