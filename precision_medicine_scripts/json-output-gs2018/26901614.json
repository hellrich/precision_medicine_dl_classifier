The interaction between PD-L1 expression and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) remains poorly understood. This study investigated the expression of PD-L1 in surgically resected stage I pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and correlated it with TILs in tumour microenvironments, common driver mutations, and clinical outcomes.\nOne hundred and five patients with surgically resected stage I squamous cell carcinoma were examined. Paraffin-embedded tumour sections were stained with PD-L1 antibody. Tumours with moderate-to-strong membrane staining in â‰¥ 5% of tumour cells were scored as positive for PD-L1 expression. The driver mutation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) were examined by direct sequencing, while anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic alpha (PI3KCA), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) were analysed by immunohistochemistry. The correlations of PD-L1 expression with each subtype of TIL, driver mutations, clinicopathologic parameters, and clinical outcomes were analysed.\nThere was positive PD-L1 expression in 56.2% (59/105) of patients. PD-L1 expression was not associated with the common clinicopathologic features and mutations of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ALK, PI3KCA, and FGFR1. As regards TILs composition, tumour PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with increased tumour epithelial CD8+ T cells and stromal CD4+ T cells. Otherwise, PD-L1 (+) tumour cells were negatively correlated with PD-L1 (+) immune cells within tumour stroma. By multivariate analysis, tumour PD-L1 expression and increased CD4+ T cell infiltrations in the tumour stroma were independent predictors of better overall survival and had a trend of better disease-free survival.\nPD-L1 expression is associated with a favourable immune microenvironment in stage I pulmonary SqCC and correlates with better clinical outcome.","title":"Programmed cell death-ligand 1 expression is associated with a favourable immune microenvironment and better overall survival in stage I pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26901614"}
