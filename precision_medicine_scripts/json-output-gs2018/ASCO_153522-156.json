Alterations affecting the splice sites of MET exon 14 have been identified, which cause exon skipping, MET activation, and predict sensitivity to MET inhibitors in vitro. We undertook comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of a large series of advanced cancers to identify MET exon 14 alterations. Methods:   DNA was typically extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections from 34,735 cases examined between April 2012 and January 2015. CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of \u003e 500x. All classes of genomic alterations (GA) were evaluated. Results:   CGP of 34,735 patients identified 200 cases harboring METex14 alterations. The alterations had diverse sequence composition, with \u003e 100 distinct sequence variants represented. The 200 patients had a median age of 68.2 years (range 15-83), with 86 males and 114 females. The cases were comprised of lung carcinoma (173), carcinomas of unknown primary (14), brain glioma (6),  and one each of adrenal cortical carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma,  melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma renal cell carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, sarcoma NOS, and synovial sarcoma. The majority were stage IV. Identification of this alteration via CGP in routine clinical care has led to treatment with MET inhibitors such as crizotinib, and to durable partial responses or better exceeding 3 months in histiocytic sarcoma (1), sarcomatoid lung carcinoma (1), and nsclc (1+). Multiple patients (5+) have initiated treatment on either crizotinib or MET inhibitors in clinical development, and additional outcome data will be reported. Conclusions:   MET exon 14 alterations define a hereto unrecognized population of advanced cancers. Early reports of patients demonstrate cases harboring such alterations are responsive to multiple small molecule MET inhibitors. This finding expands the population of advanced cancer patients who can derive benefit from MET-targeted therapies.","title":"Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of advanced cancers to identify MET exon 14 alterations that confer sensitivity to MET inhibitors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_153522-156"}
