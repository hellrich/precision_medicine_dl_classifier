A wide range of BCR-ABL1 KD mutations that confer resistance to TKIs have been identified, and the T315I mutant has proven particularly difficult to target. This review summarizes the prevalence, impact, and prognostic implications of BCR-ABL1 KD mutations in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who are treated with current TKIs and provides an overview of recent treatment guidelines and future trends for the detection of mutations.
