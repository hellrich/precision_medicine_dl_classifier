Experiments revealed enhanced SERT and MAOA mRNA levels in the losers compared with the winners and controls. It has been supposed that SERT and MAOA genes are involved in enhancement of serotonin inactivation in response to the increase of serotonergic activity shown earlier in the losers. A positive correlation between MAOA and SERT mRNA levels in the raphe nuclei area of the midbrain was shown.","title":"Repeated experience of social defeats increases serotonin transporter and monoamine oxidase A mRNA levels in raphe nuclei of male mice.","pubmedId":"11872248"}
