This interaction helps to maintain erbB2 activity that contributes to tumor progression. We investigated whether CD44 and erbB2 similarly interact in endometrial carcinomas in vitro and in situ. In contrast to other carcinomas, CD44 did not colocalize with erbB2 in any of the 51 cases of endometrial cancer analyzed. CD44 also did not coimmunoprecipitate or colocalize with erbB2 in two endometrial carcinoma cell lines. We propose that the lack of CD44-erbB2 interactions may reduce the contribution of erbB2 to endometrial carcinoma progression.","title":"Endometrial carcinoma cells are nonpermissive for CD44-erbB2 interactions.","pubmedId":"12373151"}
