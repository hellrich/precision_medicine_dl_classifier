These cells have potential therapeutic applications, but are recognised to have defective function. In normal DCs, activation and maturation depend on ABL1 dependent signals. We therefore tested the hypothesis that in the DCs of chronic myeloid leukaemia, the presence of the BCR/ABL1 molecule disrupts normal ABL1 signal pathways, and contributes to the observed functional defects of the cells.\nWe employed in vitro culture of clinical samples, combining microscopic and biochemical techniques with a phosphoproteomic approach to compare and characterise DCs from normal individuals and chronic myeloid leukaemia patients.\nWe identified an altered intracellular localisation for ABL1 within DCs derived from the monocytes of chronic myeloid leukaemia. The protein was found in the perinuclear region co-distributed with the adapter-protein CRKL and the BCR/ABL1 protein. This altered distribution was associated with defective generation of ABL1-dependent maturation signals, and a dislocation of ABL1 from the F-actin cytoskeleton. We suggest that abnormal ABL1-dependent signals contribute to the recognised functional defects affecting chronic myeloid leukaemia DCs.","title":"Monocyte-derived dendritic cells from chronic myeloid leukaemia have abnormal maturation and cytoskeletal function that is associated with defective localisation and signalling by normal ABL1 protein.","pubmedId":"24617663"}
