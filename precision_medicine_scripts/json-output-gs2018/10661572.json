To examine the generation of DCs from hemopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow (BM), lineage-negative (Lin-)/CD71- bone marrow cells (BMCs) from C57BL/6 mice were separated into major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ihigh/ c-kit(low) and MHC class Ihigh/c-kit(low)(phenotypically c-kit-negative, but c-kit message only detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) populations. A large number of cells with the morphological, phenotypical, and functional characteristics of DCs was generated from both c-kit(low) and c-kit(low) populations when cultured with a combination of cytokines (GM-CSF, tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-a], interleukin 7 [IL-7], IL-3, stem cell factor [SCF], and flt3 ligand); the cytokine combination studies revealed that SCF and IL-3 in addition to GM-CSF and TNF-a are essential for DCs to be generated from these primitive populations. To our surprise most (\u003e80%) generated cells expressed high levels of DC surface markers such as DEC205 and MHC class II, and they were potent stimulators in the primary allogeneic T cell activation. The development of DCs from c-kit(\u003clow) cells was slower than that from c-kit(low) cells. These results indicate that c-kit(\u003clow) cells are more primitive than c-kit(low) cells, although both c-kit*(low) cells and c-kit(\u003clow) cells can differentiate into DCs. It should be noted that the combination of these cytokines selectively induces DCs from both c-kit(\u003clow) and c-kit(low) cells in vitro, suggesting that the ex vivo expansion of DCs using these primitive cells would be applicable to immunotherapy.","title":"Development of mouse dendritic cells from lineage-negative c-kit(low) pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells in vitro.","pubmedId":"10661572"}
