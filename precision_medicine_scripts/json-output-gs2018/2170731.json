She had a coin lesion in the left upper lung field on chest X-ray film. Before one month on admission to our hospital, she noticed a tumor in the left thigh and underwent simple resection. Histological diagnosis was liposarcoma. Lung metastasis of the liposarcoma or primary lung cancer were suspected. Lung wedge resection was performed and adenoid cystic carcinoma was diagnosed.

In this case, the tumor originated from the peripheral lung field.","title":"[A case of peripheral adenoid cystic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"2170731"}
