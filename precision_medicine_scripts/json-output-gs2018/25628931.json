Reports have suggested that a set of specific miRNAs may be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for astrocytoma grading. However, there are few studies of the specific miRNAs differentially expressed in each astrocytoma grade. MiRNA-containing total RNA was isolated from archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from WHO grade II-IV astrocytoma patients. The RNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix miRNA 2.0 arrays. Statistical analysis identified several miRNAs differentially expressed in each astrocytoma grade. In particular, miR-27a, miR-210, and miR-1225-5p expression levels were able to differentiate grade IV from grade II and III astrocytomas as confirmed by real-time PCR. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that disease progression occurred faster for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) patients with a lower miR-27a expression level. Transfection of CRL-1690 GBM human cancer cells with a miR-27a oligonucleotide inhibitor followed by Real-time PCR identified six potential miR-27a target genes. Furthermore, the miR-27a oligonucleotide inhibitor induced CRL-1690 cell apoptosis. Taken together, our results provide additional miRNA signatures for distinguishing GBM from lower astrocytoma grades and suggest miR-27a as a prognostic and therapeutic target for GBM.
