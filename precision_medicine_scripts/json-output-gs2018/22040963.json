Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR, capillary electrophoresis was used to detect the ITD characteristics in 31 de novo AML patients, and DNA sequences analysis of FLT3-ITD(+) were performed in 13 patients. The results showed that the ratios of mutant to wild type FLT3 allele ranged from 0.01 to 2.8; 28 patients (90.32%) had a single ITD, the remaining 3 patients had more than one ITD; the ITD length ranged from 3 to 144 bp in all FLT3-ITD(+) patients. 13 sequence-analyzed patients, 4 patients were of pure duplications, and 2 patients had foreign bases inserted, and the other 7 patients were partial duplications. The ITD occurred in the regions from p.E573 to p.P606 of the FLT3 protein, with the majority clustered in a stretch between p.F590 and p.R595. The complete remission (CR) rate in AR \u003c 0.5 patients (43.75%) were more prevalent as compared with AR ≥ 0.5 patients (16.67%) (p \u003e 0.05). It is concluded that the ITD length and AR are vary widely. Some of the insertions are foreign bases, and all of the 13 sequences-analyzed ITD were concentrated on the juxtamembrane domain. The CR rate in patients of AR \u003c 0.5 had no statistical significance compared with patients of AR ≥ 0.5.","title":"[Analysis of ITD characteristics in acute myeloid leukemia patients with FLT3-ITD positive].","pubmedId":"22040963"}
