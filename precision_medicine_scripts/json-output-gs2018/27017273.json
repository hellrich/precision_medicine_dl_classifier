Lymph node ratio-based N system (Nr) has been repeatedly reported to be of prognostic relevance in advanced gastric cancer independent of stage in the multivariate analysis world-wide, and proposed as more sophisticated than N with regard to predicting accurate prognosis. As a result, proposed TNrM system may predict survival more accurately than the present TNM staging system for patients undergoing limited lymph node analysis. It could adjust stage migration when the lymph node number was used as staging factor. Although correlation of the number of metastatic lymph nodes and lymph node ratio is obvious, biological characteristics other than that could also have been reflected on. It may indicate how successful the operation of lymph node dissection was, or it may be revealing the potential of the patient\u0027s lymph node immune-reaction. Recently, high lymph node ratio is closely associated with EGFR expression in advanced gastric cancer. When efficiency of applying lymph node ratio as a biomarker is verified and confirmed in an expansive research, and when cancer causing molecules are identified, as well as the competence as a treatment target is studied, the new biomarker, namely, lymph node ratio, could find itself in a limelight in gastric cancer treatment in the future.
