Histologically, ALCL is characterized by the proliferation of large, anaplastic lymphoid cells with eccentric horseshoe- or kidney-shaped nuclei and one or more prominent nucleoli. Rare cases have been cited in the literature of ALCL presenting primarily in the oral cavity. The purpose of this article was to present 2 instructive cases of CD30+, anaplastic lymphoma kinase-negative ALCL with oral and systemic involvement.","title":"Two cases of CD30+, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma with oral manifestations.","pubmedId":"22940020"}
