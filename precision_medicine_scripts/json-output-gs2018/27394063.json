Mutation status of RAS was determined by polymerase chain reaction and mass spectrophotometry.\nThe frequency of KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS mutations was 39.6%, 4.3%, and 1.7%, respectively. The KRAS mutation was associated with fewer left-sided tumors, fewer poor differentiated tumors, more mucin component, and less lymphovascular invasion. The NRAS or HRAS mutations were not associated with any of the clinicopathologic features examined. After univariate analysis, only NRAS mutation was associated with patients\u0027 overall and disease-free survival. However, the association of NRAS with patients\u0027 overall and disease-free survival disappeared after stepwise elimination.\nThis study demonstrates the clinicopathologic characteristics of CRC patients with RAS mutations. Patients with NRAS mutation tended to have worse outcomes.","title":"Mutation spectra of RAS gene family in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"27394063"}
