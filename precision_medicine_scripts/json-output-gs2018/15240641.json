These genetic syndromes are associated with germline-activating mutations of the RET protooncogene, a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, which is believed to modulate specific intracellular signaling pathways involved in the regulation of C cell proliferation and apoptosis. RET-activating mutations involve two important functional areas of the receptor: the cysteine-rich extracellular domain and the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma are more commonly associated with mutations in the cysteine-rich extracellular domain, whereas multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B is exclusively associated with mutations involving the second intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Here, we describe a novel missense mutation of the RET protooncogene that substitutes arginine for proline at codon 912 of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain in a family with medullary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"A novel point mutation of the RET protooncogene involving the second intracellular tyrosine kinase domain in a family with medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"15240641"}
