The frequency of PIK3CA mutations differed markedly according to hormone receptor (estrogen receptor alpha [ERα] and progesterone receptor [PR]) and ERBB2 status, ranging from 12.5% in the triple-negative subgroup (ER-/PR-/ERBB2-) to 41.1% in the HR+/ERBB2- subgroup. PIK3CA mutation was associated with significantly longer metastasis-free survival in the overall population (P \u003d 0.0056), and especially in the PR-positive and ERBB2-positive subgroups. In Cox multivariate regression analysis, the prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutation status persisted only in the ERBB2-positive subgroup.\nThis study confirms the high prevalence of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer. PIK3CA mutation is an emerging tumor marker which might become used in treatment-choosing process. The independent prognostic value of PIK3CA mutation status in ERBB2-positive breast cancer patients should be now confirmed in larger series of patients included in randomized prospective ERBB2-based clinical trials.","title":"PIK3CA mutation impact on survival in breast cancer patients and in ERα, PR and ERBB2-based subgroups.","pubmedId":"22330809"}
