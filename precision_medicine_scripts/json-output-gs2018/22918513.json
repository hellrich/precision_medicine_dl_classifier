Current diagnostic criteria are suboptimal when applied to pediatric populations, as most common symptoms often do not begin to appear until teenage years.\nWe studied minor and major clinical features in 30 children/teenagers and compared the findings with 75 adults from 26 families with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.\nFifty percent of children/teenagers and 82% of adults had at least one basal cell carcinoma. Jaw cysts occurred in 60% of children/teenagers and 81% of adults. Palmar/plantar pits were the most frequent feature seen in affected individuals at all ages. Macrocephaly was seen in 50% of affected and 8% of unaffected children/teenagers. Frontal bossing, hypertelorism, Sprengel deformity, pectus deformity, and cleft lip/palate were seen among affected children/teenagers but not among their unaffected siblings. Falx calcification, the most frequent radiological feature, was present in 37% of individuals \u003c20 and 79% of those \u003e20 years.\nWe report clinical and radiological manifestations of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome in children/teenagers, many of whom lacked major features such as basal cell carcinomas, jaw cysts, and falx calcification. Evaluations for palmar/plantar pits, craniofacial features, and radiological manifestations permit early diagnosis and optimum surveillance.","title":"Clinical and radiological features in young individuals with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.","pubmedId":"22918513"}
