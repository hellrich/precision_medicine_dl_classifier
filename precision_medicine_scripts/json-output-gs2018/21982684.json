The data showed the concordant rate of EGFR genotype in primary and stage N2 lymph node-metastatic tumors was 95.45%. c-Met GCN in stage N2 lymph nodes was significantly higher than that of the primary tumors (P\u003d0.038). The results suggest both primary and lymph-node metastases have relatively consistent EGFR mutations and EGFR mutations are not relevant to changes in c-Met GCN. c-Met GCN was increased significantly in EGFR TKI-naive patients with lymph node-metastatic tumors.","title":"EGFR and KRAS mutations and altered c-Met gene copy numbers in primary non-small cell lung cancer and associated stage N2 lymph node-metastasis.","pubmedId":"21982684"}
