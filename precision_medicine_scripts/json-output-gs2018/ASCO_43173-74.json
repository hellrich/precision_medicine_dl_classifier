Methods: In 2008, we established a Personalized Cancer Medicine Registry (PCMR) and began consenting patients for the following: 1) prospective genotyping of their cancer; 2) storing their tumor material for future research; and 3) permission to re-contact them if their tumor genotype fits the profile for a new therapeutic. As of the end of 2009, more than 800 patients were enrolled in the PCMR, including cases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC, n \u003d 199), endometrioid carcinoma (EC, n \u003d 95), thyroid carcinoma (TC, n \u003d 276), bladder carcinoma (n \u003d 80), and malignant melanoma (MM, n \u003d 163 ). Tumor DNA from archival tissue was genotyped using a Sequenom MassArray system. Each sample was analyzed using a panel (320 assays) that detects known mutations in 29 genes. Clinical and genotyping data are stored in a web-interfaced, customized SQL database. Results: 95% of approached patients consented to registry enrollment. Archival tumor suitable for analysis was obtained in 95% of cases. Mutations in EC include PIK3CA (21%), CTNNB1 (13%), KRAS (11%), FBXW7 (5%), TP53 (5%), AKT1 (4%), FGFR2 (3%), NRAS (1%) and PDGFRA (1%); 14 cases harbor 2 or more mutations. Among cutaneous MM we found mutations in BRAF (47%; 10.8% other than V600E), NRAS (13%), CTNNB1 (3%), PIK3CA (2%), AKT1 (1%) and MEK2 (1%). In CRC we found mutations in KRAS (30%), TP53 (16%), PIK3CA (12%), NRAS / BRAF / FBXW7 (3% each), CTNNB1 (2%), and MEK1 / AKT1 / AKT2 / RET (1% each). Remarkably, 10 of 14 CRC tumors (71%) with a PIK3CA mutation also have a KRAS mutation. In TC, we found mutations of BRAF (63%), RET-PTC (7%), and PIK3CA/KRAS/NRAS/HRAS (1.5% each). Conclusions: Prospective tumor genotyping for PCMR patients reveals a remarkable diversity of potentially druggable mutations, knowledge of which will help in clinical trial enrollment. While rare in the examined tumors, mutations in FGFR2, MEK1/2, AKT1/2, PDGFRA and RET could be targeted as part of individualized cancer treatments. In CRC, the common overlap of PIK3CA mutations with KRAS mutations may negatively impact response to inhibitors of the PI3 kinase pathway.","title":"Mass spectroscopy-based cancer genotyping of 800 patients enrolled in a personalized cancer medicine registry.","pubmedId":"ASCO_43173-74"}
