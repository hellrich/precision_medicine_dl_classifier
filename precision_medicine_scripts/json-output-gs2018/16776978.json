Immunohistochemical staining for ALK and survivin proteins was performed using LSAB method.\nALK protein was positive in 51 cases (63%) and negative in 30 cases (37%) of the 81 cases of ALCL studied. The prognosis of patients with ALK protein expression was better than those without ALK expression (P \u003c 0.05). As for survivin protein, there were various degrees of expression in all the 77 ALCL cases studied. High level of survivin protein expression was observed in 33 cases (42.9%), while low level of expression was seen in 44 cases (57.1%). The expression of survivin protein did not correlate with that of ALK protein (P \u003e 0.05). The survival rate was significantly lower in patients with high survivin protein expression (P \u003c 0.05). In cases with ALK protein expression, the prognosis was less favorable if there was also high co-expression of survivin protein (P \u003c 0.05). In ALK protein negative cases, prognosis did not significantly correlate with the expression of survivin protein (P \u003e 0.05). In addition, multivariate analysis confirmed the prognosis value of ALK protein expression, survivin protein expression and constitutional symptoms.\nSurvivin protein expression can serve as an independent prognostic predictor of unfavorable clinical outcome in patients with ALCL, especially when ALK protein is positive.","title":"[Expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase and survivin proteins in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and its significance].","pubmedId":"16776978"}
