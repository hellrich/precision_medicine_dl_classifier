These mutations affect the APC cleavage site at arginine (Arg) 306 in the heavy chain of activated FV. Whether these mutations result in APC resistance and are associated with a risk of thrombosis is not clear. The main objective of the present study was to identify the APC-resistant phenotype of FV molecules with different mutations in APC cleavage sites. To study this, recombinant FV mutants were reconstituted in FV-deficient plasma, after which normalized APC-sensitivity ratios (n-APC-SRs) were measured in activated partial thromboplastin time-based and Russell\u0027s Viper Venom time-based APC-resistance tests. The mutations introduced in FV were R306G, R306T, R506Q, R679A and combinations of these mutations. Based on the APC-sensitivity ratios, we conclude that the naturally occurring mutations at Arg306 (i.e. FV HongKong and FV Cambridge) result in a mildly reduced sensitivity for APC (n-APC-SR, 0.74-0.87), whereas much lower values (n-APC-SR, 0.41-0.51) are obtained for the mutation at Arg506 (FV Leiden). No effect on the n-APC-SR was observed for the recombinant FV mutant containing the single Ala679 mutation. Because reduced sensitivity for APC, not due to FV Leiden, is a risk factor for venous thrombosis, these data suggest that mutations at Arg306 might be associated with a mild risk of venous thrombosis.","title":"The activated protein C (APC)-resistant phenotype of APC cleavage site mutants of recombinant factor V in a reconstituted plasma model.","pubmedId":"11943934"}
