Recent studies have implicated PTEN as a determinant of homologous recombination (HR) through defective RAD51 function. Similar to BRCA1/2-defective tumor cells, PTEN-null prostate and other cancer cells have been reported to be sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi). To date, no direct comparison between PTEN and RAD51 expression in primary prostate tumors has been reported.\nProstate cancer cell lines and xenografts with known PTEN status (22RV1-PTEN(+/+), DU145-PTEN(+/-), PC3-PTEN(-/-)) and H1299 and HCT116 cancer cells were used to evaluate how PTEN loss affects RAD51 expression and PARPi sensitivity. Primary prostate cancers with known PTEN status were analyzed for RAD51 expression.\nPTEN status is not associated with reduced RAD51 mRNA or protein expression in primary prostate cancers. Decreased PTEN expression did not reduce RAD51 expression or clonogenic survival following PARPi among prostate cancer cells that vary in TP53 and PTEN. PARPi sensitivity instead associated with a defect in MRE11 expression. PTEN-deficient cells had only mild PARPi sensitivity and no loss of HR or RAD51 recruitment. Clonogenic cell survival following a series of DNA damaging agents was variable: PTEN-deficient cells were sensitive to ionizing radiation, mitomycin-C, UV, H(2)O(2), and methyl methanesulfonate but not to cisplatin, camptothecin, or paclitaxel.\nThese data suggest that the relationship between PTEN status and survival following DNA damage is indirect and complex. It is unlikely that PTEN status will be a direct biomarker for HR status or PARPi response in prostate cancer clinical trials.","title":"PTEN deletion in prostate cancer cells does not associate with loss of RAD51 function: implications for radiotherapy and chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"22114138"}
