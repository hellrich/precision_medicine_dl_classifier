In the present study, 31 primary melanomas of the nodular type and 15 metastases occurring between 1981 and 1983 were studied with respect to mutations in exons 7 and 8, as well as to p53 protein immunostaining using different antibodies. Altogether 13% of the primary tumors showed strong p53 staining using the DO-7 antibody. Different results were obtained with other antibodies. Seven mutations were found in primary and metastatic tumors; all of these were single base changes, most of which occurred in the core domain of the p53 protein responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding (residues 102-293). The mutations were not significantly associated with p53 staining results, and p53 alterations (mutations or marked immunopositivity) had no prognostic value. Our results indicate that point mutations in exons 7 and 8 are more frequent than previously reported in primary melanomas, and such changes may be important for the development of certain melanoma subgroups.","title":"Frequent mutations of the p53 gene in cutaneous melanoma of the nodular type.","pubmedId":"9495365"}
