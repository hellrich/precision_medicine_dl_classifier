The prognostic role of the polymorphism was assessed in 102 patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.\nWe followed up 102 consecutive Caucasian patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma for \u003e5 years and determined the status of the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism in DNA samples extracted from archived gastric tissues.\nThe frequency of the arginine homozygous allele was positively correlated to patient age at baseline (P \u003d 0.002). However, the age-related increase in the percentage of codon 72 arginine p53 was not correlated to the prognosis for gastric cancer patients. Multivariable analysis in patients who had surgery showed that baseline age may be inversely associated with patient survival (odds ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.2; P \u003d 0.02). Furthermore, alcohol consumption may be associated with reduced survival (P \u003d 0.06).\nThese findings indicate that codon 72 arginine p53 may not be associated with a prolonged survival in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, but further study is needed to assess whether this polymorphism is associated with a late onset or slow progress of early gastric adenocarcinoma.","title":"Prognostic value of TP53 codon 72 polymorphism in advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"14734461"}
