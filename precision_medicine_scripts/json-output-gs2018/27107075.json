Immunohistochemistry revealed that PD-L1 is frequently expressed in malignant melanoma, mammary gland tumor, mast cell tumor and lymphoma, but less frequently in soft-tissue sarcoma and hemangiosarcoma. PD-L1 was also expressed in some of the cells of normal canine tissue specimens.\nCanine tumors with PD-L1 expression that were identified in this study are potential candidates for antiPD-1 and antiPD-L1 therapy.","title":"Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 Expression in Canine Cancer.","pubmedId":"27107075"}
