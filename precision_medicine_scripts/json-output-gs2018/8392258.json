The specimens were divided into small cell and non-small cell carcinoma, and the extent of tumor cord was determined. All cases of small cell carcinoma examined were found to have tumor cord structure, although its degree was variable. On the other hand, in non-small cell carcinoma, tumor cord was observed only in part of the cases. Small cell carcinoma responds usually well to therapies, although recurrence occurs frequently. These characteristics of small cell carcinoma could be explained by biphasic cell survival after treatment of tumors with tumor cord structure.","title":"Tumor cord structure in human lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"8392258"}
