With these patients another primary malignant melanoma developed, though not a metastasis. It appears that SSM gives no protection against other melanomas of the superficial or nodular type. In comparison, a 70-year-old patient had had a pigmented tumour for about 40 years and this suddenly spread five years ago; however, at least some of the metastases regressed to form vitiligo-like lesions surrounding deposits of melanin in macrophages. In this case the spontaneous regression did not protect the patient against new metastases in the lymph nodes and probably in the liver as well.","title":"[Primary multiple malignant melanomas of unusually long duration].","pubmedId":"1007359"}
