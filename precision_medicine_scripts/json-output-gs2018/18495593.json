Dual-color FISH identified 6 positive specimens, including the 4 specimens with both nuclear and cytoplasmic positivity as identified immunohistochemically, and 2 with immunohistochemical cytoplasmic positivity. FISH yielded negative results for the 2 specimens with immunohistochemical cytoplasmic positivity.\nNuclear microarray combined with FISH eliminated the cytoplasmic interference of the results of conventional FISH and provides a high-throughput platform for clinical detection with greater specificity than immunohistochemistry.","title":"[Nuclear microarray combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization for detecting ALK gene translocation in paraffin-embedded anaplastic large cell lymphoma and its significance].","pubmedId":"18495593"}
