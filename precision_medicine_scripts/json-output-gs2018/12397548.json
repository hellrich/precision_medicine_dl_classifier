Recently mutations of a growth factor receptor have been identified in about 30 % of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations are associated with a poor prognosis. In-vitro and animal data show their involvement in leukemic transformation. Experiments analyzing the effects of these mutations on signal transduction and gene expression patterns of myeloid cells allow for the classification of this receptor as an oncogene. Furthermore, they help to define the receptor and its signaling intermediates as therapeutic targets.\nIn order to analyze the signaling properties of mutated FLT3 receptors, we isolated the receptor mRNA from two patients with AML. Wild-type and mutant Flt3 isoforms were expressed in 32D cells that were subsequently analyzed for proliferation, survival, activation of signaling intermediates and gene expression levels. Also, the effects of of Ras-, MAP-Kinase and PI3-Kinase inhibition were analyzed.\nThe expression of mutated Flt3 (Flt3-ITD) induced factor-independent proliferation and survival in the myeloid progenitor cell line 32D. Flt3-ITD activated Ras- and PI3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways, as well as STAT5 and STAT3. Activation of STAT proteins was followed by the induction of known STAT target genes like SOCS2, SOCS3 and CIS. Inhibition of Ras-dependent signal transduction by a dominant negative Ras construct inhibited some, but not all biological effects of Flt3-ITD. Similar results were obtained by chemical inhibition of the MAP kinases. In contrast, inhibition of PI3 kinase activity inhibited growth factor-independent growth and apoptosis resistance of 32D cells.\nInhibition of Ras-dependent signaling pathways is not sufficient to abrogate the functional consequences of Flt3-mutations in myeloid cells. Therefore, therapeutic intervention by Ras-Inhibitors may not be sufficient to treat Flt3-driven disease.","title":"[Mutations of growth factor receptor Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia: transformation of myeloid cells by Ras-dependent and Ras-independent mechanisms].","pubmedId":"12397548"}
