He was diagnosed as leiomyosarcoma of residual stomach associated with liver metastases. After preoperative transarterial embolization (TAE) with epirubicin of the anterior branch of right hepatic artery, residual stomach was resected, and the reservoir catheter and infusion arterial port were implanted. He was treated by intra-hepato-arterial chemotherapy of epirubicin. The patient has remained well for 2 years and 3 months without apparent complications.","title":"[A case of liver metastasis of leiomyosarcoma of residual stomach successfully treated by TAE and intra-hepato-arterial chemotherapy with infusion-a-port with administration of epirubicin].","pubmedId":"7979432"}
