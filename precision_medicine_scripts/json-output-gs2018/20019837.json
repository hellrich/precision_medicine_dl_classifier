Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a receptor tyrosine kinase with demonstrated roles in regulating cellular proliferation, motility, morphogenesis, and apoptosis. Met receptor and its ligand, HGF, are commonly overexpressed in NSCLC, and their overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis, which could potentially involve a paracrine and/or autocrine activation loop. However, there is as yet no direct evidence that HGF-Met signaling directly promotes metastasis in NSCLC cells. Using retroviral transduction, we overexpressed the human c-met and hgf complementary DNA, alone or in combination in the NCI-H460 human large cell carcinoma cell line. The HGF/Met co-overexpressing (H460-HGF/Met) cells demonstrated enhanced tumorigenicity in xenograft SCID mice. When these cells are implanted orthotopically into the lungs of nude rats, only the H460-HGF/Met cells showed higher spontaneous metastases to distant organs including bone, brain, and kidney. These results provide evidence that autocrine overactivation of the Met- HGF loop enhances systemic metastases in NSCLC. Targeted interference of this loop may potentially be an effective adjuvant therapy to improve survival of early-stage NSCLC patients.","title":"Co-overexpression of Met and hepatocyte growth factor promotes systemic metastasis in NCI-H460 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"20019837"}
