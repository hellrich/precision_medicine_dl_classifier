Here, we investigated the influence of multiple RET variants (G691S, L769L, S836S, and S904S) on the risk of MTC and tumor behavior.\nOne hundred and seven MTC patients and 308 cancer-unaffected control individuals were included. SNPs were analyzed using Custom TaqMan Genotyping Assays. Haplotypes based on the combination of allelic variants were inferred using a Bayesian statistical method.\nThe minor allele frequencies in MTC patients were as follows: L769L: 28.0%, S836S: 8.9%, and G691S/S904S: 22.2%. The RET L769L and S836S SNPs were associated with increased risk of MTC (odds ratio (OR)\u003d1.95, 95% CI: 1.2-3.1, P\u003d0.005 and OR\u003d2.29, 95% CI: 1.2-4.5, P\u003d0.017 respectively). The adjusted OR for individuals harboring haplotypes with three or more polymorphic alleles was 3.79 (95% CI: 1.5-9.5; P\u003d0.004), indicating an additive effect of these variants on the risk for MTC. Among MTC patients, no significant associations were observed between RET variants and age of diagnosis or tumor size but serum calcitonin levels increased according to the number of risk alleles (P\u003d0.003). Remarkably, patients carrying haplotypes with three or four risk alleles had increased risk for lymph node and distant metastases at diagnosis (OR\u003d5.84, 95% CI: 1.1-31.2, P\u003d0.039). Further analysis using Kaplan-Meier model demonstrated that metastatic disease occurred earlier in individuals harboring multiple risk alleles.\nOur results demonstrated an additive effect of RET polymorphic alleles on the estimated risk of developing aggressive MTC.","title":"Additive effect of RET polymorphisms on sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma susceptibility and tumor aggressiveness.","pubmedId":"22345297"}
