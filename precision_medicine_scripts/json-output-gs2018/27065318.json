However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie ErbB2 dysregulation in breast cancer cells remain incompletely understood. In this study, we found that ErbB2 expression is inversely correlated with the level of miR-155, a well-documented oncogenic miRNA, in ErbB2-positive breast tumors. We further determined that miR-155 potently suppresses ErbB2 in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, miR-155 acts to downregulate ErbB2 via two distinct mechanisms. First, miR-155 represses ErbB2 transcription by targeting HDAC2, a transcriptional activator of ErbB2. Second, miR-155 directly targets ErbB2 via a regulatory element in its coding region. Intriguingly, miR-155 is upregulated by trastuzumab and in turn leads to a reduction of ErbB2 expression in trastuzumab-treated ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells. Functional studies showed that miR-155 inhibits ErbB2-induced malignant transformation of human breast epithelial cells. Thus, our findings reveal an intriguing miR-155-ErbB2 context in regulating the malignant transformation of breast epithelial cells, and thereby indicate a novel mode of action for miR-155 in ErbB2-positive breast cancer.","title":"miR-155 downregulates ErbB2 and suppresses ErbB2-induced malignant transformation of breast epithelial cells.","pubmedId":"27065318"}
