Despite the intense research in the area of squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck (HNSCC), long-term survival rate has not changed significantly in this malignancy during recent decades.\nIn this study, we focused on TP53 mutations in specific regions, including DNA-binding surface, to determine whether mutations at specific locations of TP53 could be used to help in setting up prognosis and response to therapy of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. We analysed TP53 mutations in 46 HNSCC by PCR-SSCP and sequencing and characterized how different TP53 mutations affect the patient outcome.\nTumours containing TP53 mutations in DNA-binding regions (L2, L3 and LSH motif) had a significantly poorer prognosis and response to radiotherapy than tumours outside those regions. Disease-specific 5-year survival of patients with TP53 mutations affecting DNA contacts was 43.5% while it was 77.8% (p \u003c 0.05) in patients with TP53 mutations in other residues not involved in DNA contact. Moreover, nodal metastasis were more prevalent (although not statistically significantly) with TP53 mutations in DNA-binding surface regions. We noticed that the patients with TP53 mutations in L3/LSH motifs had a significantly poorer response (11.4% responding) to radiation than the patients with a wild type p53 (48.6%) or TP53 mutations outside the DNA-binding regions (40%) (p \u003c 0.05).\nThese data indicate that a TP53 mutation in L2, L3 or LSH is worth pursuing as a marker for predicting prognosis and response to radiation among HNSCC patients.","title":"Specific TP53 mutations predict aggressive phenotype in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a retrospective archival study.","pubmedId":"21513535"}
