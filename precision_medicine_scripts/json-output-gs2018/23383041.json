However, the results of previous reports remain controversial and ambiguous. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to explore more precisely the association between MDM2 309 polymorphism and the risk of ovarian cancer.\nA meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between MDM2 309T\u003eG polymorphism and ovarian cancer risk. Odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for statistical analysis.\nOur publication search identified a total of 6 studies with 1534 cases and 2211 controls. No significant association was found between MDM2 309T\u003eG polymorphism and ovarian cancer risk in total population analysis. In the subgroup meta-analysis by ethnicity, a negative association was shown in Asian subgroup (G vs. T OR \u003d 0.774, 95% CI \u003d 0.628-0.955, P \u003d 0.017, P(het) \u003d 0.327; GG vs. TT: OR \u003d 0.601, 95% CI \u003d 0.395-0.914, P \u003d 0.017, P(het) \u003d 0.417; dominant model TG+GG vs. TT: OR \u003d 0.661, 95% CI \u003d 0.468-0.934, P \u003d 0.019, P(het) \u003d 0.880), and no significant association in any genetic models among Caucasians was observed.\nThis meta-analysis provides evidence for the association between MDM2 309 polymorphism and ovarian cancer risk, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 SNP309 G allele acts as an important ovarian cancer protective factor in Asians but not in Caucasians.","title":"The MDM2 309T\u003eG polymorphism and ovarian cancer risk: a meta-analysis of 1534 cases and 2211 controls.","pubmedId":"23383041"}
