The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical presentation and standard therapy of ALCLs by investigating reported cases. Additionally, a case of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ALCL in a 20-year-old man who exhibited no recurrence for \u003e5 years following high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) treatment was described. Twenty-six immunocompetent patients with ALCL of the CNS that were previously reported and 1 case of ALCL of the CNS treated at our hospital were investigated. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed in relation to survival factors such as age, ALK status and the treatment regimen. The male:female ratio of the patients was 19:8. Of the 27 patients, 13 (48.1%) were ALK-positive, 9 (33.3%) were ALK-negative and the ALK status was not determined in the remaining 5 patients (18.5%). ALK-positive ALCL occurred at a younger age (median age, 17 years) and exhibited a favorable course (5-year OS, 75.0%), whereas ALK-negative ALCL presented at an older age (median age, 65 years) and resulted in fatal outcomes (5-year OS, \u003c12.5%). Similar to the findings for systemic ALCL, ALK positivity, age \u003c40 years and chemotherapy are associated with long-term survival for ALCL of the CNS. Chemoradiotherapy including methotrexate is recommended for ALCL and the possibility of treatment with chemotherapy alone for ALK-positive ALCL is currently under consideration.","title":"Clinical presentation of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma in the central nervous system.","pubmedId":"24649224"}
