BRAF mutation frequency depended on histological subtype (57.4% superficial spreading melanoma, 54.7% nodular melanoma, 11.1% mucosal melanoma, 28.6% acral lentiginous melanoma) and concerning non-V600E BRAF mutations on localization of primary. In MUP the BRAF mutation pattern resembled superficial spreading and nodular melanomas.\nBRAF mutation frequencies depend on histological subtype and localization of primary melanoma. Non-V600E BRAF mutations mostly occur in patients with primaries on \u0027head and neck\u0027 as well as \u0027trunk\u0027 but not on \u0027extremities\u0027.","title":"Pathogenetic Implications of BRAF Mutation Distribution in Stage IV Melanoma Patients.","pubmedId":"26138035"}
