These tumors arise from accelerated proliferation of the ECL cells as a consequence of the hypersecretion of gastrin, situation that can be present in atrophic gastritis and the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. We report the case of a 51 year old hispanic female who presented with a 3 month history of abdominal pain, meteorism and constipation; she was treated with ranitidine and metoclopramide without clinical improvement, thus she underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which showed an atrophic gastritis and gastric polyps. Histopathologic examination revealed a neuroendocrine gastric tumor which was positive to serotonine and gastrin stainings. Hormonal screening showed normal serum levels of LH, FSH, estradiol, ACTH, progesterone, calcitonin and cortisol. The serum level of gastrin was elevated with 500 pg/mL. Gammagraphic scanning with octreotide was negative for metastasis.","title":"[Gastric neuroendocrine tumor].","pubmedId":"10068736"}
