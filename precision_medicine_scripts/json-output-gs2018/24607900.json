The prognosis of glioma patients is still poor, which makes glioma an urgent subject of cancer research. Previous evidence and our present data show that PCBP2 is over-expressed in human glioma tissues and predicts poor outcome. However, the mechanism by which PCBP2 is regulated in glioma remains elusive. We find that SIRT6, one of the NAD(+)-dependent class III deacetylase SIRTUINs, is down-regulated in human glioma tissues and that the level of SIRT6 is negatively correlated with PCBP2 level while H3K9ac enrichment on the promoter of PCBP2 is positively correlated with PCBP2 expression. Furthermore, we identify PCBP2 as a target of SIRT6. We demonstrate that PCBP2 expression is inhibited by SIRT6, which depends upon deacetylating H3K9ac. Finally, our results reveal that SIRT6 inhibits glioma cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and glioma cell growth in vivo in a PCBP2 dependent manner. In summary, our findings implicate that SIRT6 inhibits PCBP2 expression through deacetylating H3K9ac and SIRT6 acts as a tumor suppressor in human glioma.
