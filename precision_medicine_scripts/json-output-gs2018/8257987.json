These neoplasms have been called replication error positive (RER+). In this study, we confirm the presence of genomic instability in a proportion of unselected colorectal carcinomas but find no evidence of instability in adenomas. We further report replication errors in a tetranucleotide sequence, and in STRs within two tumour suppressor genes. 108 colorectal adenocarcinomas and 46 adenomas were analysed for the presence of variant bands at 4-15 microsatellite markers. Seven (6.5%) of carcinomas were RER+, four of which originated from the proximal colon. Analysis of the adenomas and of matched adenoma-carcinoma and carcinoma-metastatic samples from four patients suggests that the replication errors may occur during the development of carcinomas but are rare in adenomas.","title":"Genomic instability occurs in colorectal carcinomas but not in adenomas.","pubmedId":"8257987"}
