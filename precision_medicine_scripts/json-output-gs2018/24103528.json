The aim of this study was to investigate the existence of EGFR mutations in Chinese esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgically resected tumor samples were obtained from 127 randomly selected Chinese patients with ESCC. The most common EGFR mutations, including in-frame deletions in exon 19 and base substitutions in exon 21, were detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct sequencing simultaneously. K-RAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 were detected by direct sequencing.\nIn this study, L858R missense mutations of the EGFR gene were found in 8 out of 127 patients (6.3%) by DHPLC but no mutation was observed by direct sequencing. In addition, K-RAS mutation was detected in 2 out of 127 (1.6%) patients by direct sequencing.\nThe incidence of EGFR mutations was relatively high using DHPLC method but no mutation with direct sequencing in Chinese ESCC patients.","title":"Identification of exon 19 and 21 mutations of EGFR gene in Chinese patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24103528"}
