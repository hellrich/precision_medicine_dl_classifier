The oncogenic tyrosin kinase Bcr-Abl, which is believed to induce chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), could cause the dysregulation of mRNA translation initiation by activating a series of signal pathways. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), a critical element in the assembly of translation initiation complex, has been shown to anticipate in Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis. eIF4B is activated through Ser422 phosphorylation by several pathways including JAK/STAT/Pim and PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Such redundant activation provides mechanistic bases for the less potent antitumor consequences under single-pathway targeted therapy. Interestingly, profound synergy was observed against cell survival and tumor growth and greater decrease of eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation was detected upon the combination of Pim and mTOR inhibitors. Knockdown of eIF4B would increase the dependence of Bcr-Abl positive cells on Pim and mTOR signaling and then sensitize cells to the synergistical effect mediated by the combined inhibition. In addition, inhibiting mTOR pathway by shRNA targeting AKT or mTOR renders cells dependent on Pim pathway and knockdown Pim1 would sensitize cells to mTOR inhibitor. Thus, eIF4B acts as a prominent role in Bcr-Abl-driven pathogenesis by playing as the convergent point of these pathways which are active in Bcr-Abl positive tumors. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Bcr-Abl-induced cellular transformation can be blokced and provides a rationale for combination therapy targeting the dysregulation of translation for CML.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.","title":"Inhibition of eIF4B suppresses the growth and induces the apoptosis of Bcr-Abl positive cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4976"}
