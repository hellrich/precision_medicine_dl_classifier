This neoplasm may arise at any site in the sympathetic nervous system, including the brain, the cervical region, the posterior mediastinum, the para-aortic sympathetic ganglia, the pelvis, and the adrenal medulla. The clinical presentation in neonatal age is rare and the differential diagnosis includes congenital lung malformations, pneumoniae, atelectasia, etc. The case of a newborn with a mediastinal neuroblastoma is presented. This case illustrates how a patient with an X-ray image compatible with a thoracic tumor should be studied.","title":"[Early diagnosis of a newborn with a mediastinal mass].","pubmedId":"16381510"}
