The overall results suggested that over-expression of EGFR was significantly correlated with, not only the lymph node status and tumour differentiation grade, with a pooled OR of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.46-0.89; Z\u003d2.62; p\u003d0.009) and 1.60 (95% CI: 1.09-2.37; Z\u003d2.37; p\u003d0.018), respectively, but also the poorer OS with a pooled HR of 1.60 (95% CI: 1.05-2.43; Z\u003d2.19 p\u003d0.028).\nThis meta-analysis suggests that over-expression of EGFR might play an important role in the progression of ESCC, and it might be useful as a predictive biomarker in clinical practice, yet the predictive value of EGFR in ESCC still needs further confirmation by prospective trials.","title":"Clinicopathological and prognostic significance of EGFR over-expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"21661408"}
