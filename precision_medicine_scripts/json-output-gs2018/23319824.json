Whereas the Hedgehog pathway is inactive in most normal adult tissues, Hedgehog pathway reactivation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neoplasms including BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia. The clear link between the Hedgehog pathway and BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia led to an effort to identify small molecules to block the pathway.\nWe investigated the combined effects of vismodegib and ponatinib, a pan-ABL1 kinase inhibitor, in nonobese diabetic/severe-combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) repopulating T315I BCR-ABL1-positive cells in vitro and in vivo.\nWe observed that combination with vismodegib and ponatinib helps to eliminate therapy-resistant NOD/SCID repopulating T315I BCR-ABL1-positive cells. The percentage of CD19-positive leukemia cells in peripheral blood was significantly lower in vismodegib + ponatinib-treated mice than that of the vehicle or ponatinib alone (P \u003c 0.001). Spleen weights were also lower in vismodegib + ponatinib-treated mice than in ponatinib alone (P \u003c 0.05). Overall tumor burden, as assessed by BCR-ABL mRNA from bone marrow cells, was significantly lower in vismodegib + ponatinib-treated mice than in ponatinib alone (P \u003c 0.005). We also found that vismodegib significantly reduced BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia cell self-renewal in vitro as well as during serial transplantation in vivo.\nThe combination with a Smo inhibitor and ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors may help eliminate therapy-resistant T315I BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia cells. Our preclinical results indicate that vismodegib has potential as an important option for controlling minimal residual cells in BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia.","title":"Combination of ponatinib with Hedgehog antagonist vismodegib for therapy-resistant BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia.","pubmedId":"23319824"}
