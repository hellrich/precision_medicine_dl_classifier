The aim of the present study was to characterize the PD-L1 expression pattern and its clinical implication in soft-tissue sarcomas (STS).\nWe analyzed PD-L1 expression in 82 STS patients with 5 subtypes: rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.\nThe median age at diagnosis was 26 (range: 1-78) and the male to female ratio was 1.6. The majority (80 %) of patients showed locoregional disease rather than metastatic disease at diagnosis. Thirty-five cases (43 %) showed PD-L1 expression and the proportion of PD-L1 expression was significantly different according to histologic subtypes (P \u003d 0.004); highest in epithelioid sarcoma (100 %, 7/7), followed by synovial sarcoma (53 %, 10/19), rhabdomyosarcoma (38 %, 12/32), and Ewing sarcoma (33 %, 6/18), while it was not expressed in mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (0 %, 0/6). STS patients with PD-L1 expression had worse overall survival compared with those without PD-L1 expression (5-year survival rate: 48 % vs. 68 %, P \u003d 0.015). The Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for histologic subtype, initial metastasis, and PD-L1 expression showed that PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (P \u003d 0.037, HR 2.57, 95 % CI 1.060-6.231).\nWe have confirmed PD-L1 expression in various STS of young population and demonstrated its independent negative prognostic role, thereby suggesting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of young STS patients.","title":"Prognostic implications of PD-L1 expression in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.","pubmedId":"27393385"}
