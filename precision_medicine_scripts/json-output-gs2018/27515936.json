The expression levels and patterns of marker expression were recorded by a semiquantitative, 4-point ordinal reactivity method.\nOur results showed a consistently robust and diffuse expression of MITF protein in 12 (92%) of 13 metastatic tumors compared with variable expression of MLSN1 (46%) messenger RNA or PEDF (75%), HMB-45 (54%), and MART-1 (46%) proteins.\nOverall, in melanoma lymph node metastases, MITF protein expression was not tightly correlated with its gene targets. Moreover, the immunoreactivity for MITF, compared with MART-1 and HMB-45, was retained, supporting immunohistochemical detection of MITF as a more sensitive method of detecting metastatic melanoma.","title":"Heterogeneity of Metastatic Melanoma: â€‰Correlation of MITF With Its Transcriptional Targets MLSN1, PEDF, HMB-45, and MART-1.","pubmedId":"27515936"}
