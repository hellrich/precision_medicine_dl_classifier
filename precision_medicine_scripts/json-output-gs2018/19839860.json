Renal biopsy revealed massive leukemic infiltration of the kidney. After systemic chemotherapy, the patient developed tumor lysis syndrome followed by a phase of proximal tubule dysfunction presenting as polyuria and diverse electrolyte abnormalities. In time, renal function returned to normal, as did kidney size. This report shows that renal failure, enlargement of the kidneys, and tubule dysfunction in the course of AML infiltrating the kidneys can be reversed by treatment of the hematological disease.","title":"Reversible renal failure due to bilateral renal sarcoma in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"19839860"}
