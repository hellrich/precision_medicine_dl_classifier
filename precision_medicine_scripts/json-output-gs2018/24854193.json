The objective of the present study was to determine the mutational status of SETBP1 and CSF3R in these diseases.\nThe mutational status of SETBP1 and CSF3R was studied in 7 patients with aCML (n \u003d 3), CNL (n \u003d 1) and unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN-u) (n \u003d 3). Additionally, mutations in ASXL1, SRSF2, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, and RUNX1 were also analyzed.\nSETBP1 mutations (G870S and G872R) were detected in 2 patients with MPN-u, and one of them also presented mutations in SRSF2 (P95H) and ASXL1 (E635fs). The CNL case showed mutations in CSFR3 (T618I), SETBP1 (G870S) and SRSF2 (P95H). No patient classified as aCML had mutations in SETBP1 or CSF3R. One of the patients with mutations evolved to acute myeloid leukemia, while the other 2 had disease progression without transformation to overt leukemia.\nThe knowledge of the molecular alterations involved in these rare diseases is useful in the diagnosis and may have an impact on both prognosis and therapy.","title":"[Molecular characterization of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic neutrophilic leukemia].","pubmedId":"24854193"}
