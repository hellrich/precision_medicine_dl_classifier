In histopathology, 84 cases were classified as G1, 42 as G2, and 30 as G3. The clinical stage was in 81 cases estimated at Ta and in 75 cases at T1-T4. A148T polymorphism was detected by the MSSCP technique and by sequencing.\nA148T polymorphism was identified in 9/156 urinary bladder carcinoma cases (only in men). The obtained results were compared with the polymorphism incidence for the Polish population, estimated by Debniak et al. The occurrence in the group of the bladder cancer patients turned out higher (5.77%) from that in the control group (2.89%) (G test, table 2Ã—2: NBLADDER CANCER \u003d 156, NCONTROL \u003d 1210, G \u003d 4.298, p \u003c0.05).\nSumming up and taking into account the analysis of clinical parameters and the age of the disease occurrence, the A148T polymorphism of CDKN2A gene was identified in the study group only in men, in whom the disease was diagnosed above the age of 60, while the diagnosed neoplasms were in the majority of cases characterized by higher clinical stages and higher grades of malignancy. This has been the first study that attempted to show a potential association between A148T alterations and an increased risk for bladder cancer development.","title":"Significance of CDKN2A gene A148T variant in patients with bladder cancer.","pubmedId":"24578887"}
