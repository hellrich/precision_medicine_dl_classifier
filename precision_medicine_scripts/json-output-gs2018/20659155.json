Our objective was to determine the value of molecular monitoring Ph-positive leukemias under dasatinib treatment. We used real-time PCR and ABL1 kinase domain sequencing on sequential samples from 11 patients with Philadelphia-positive leukemias who received dasatinib. We were able to detect pre-existing mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 in four patients, particularly in patients with high BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. Most mutations disappeared with dasatinib, however, in five patients a clone with T315I appeared during dasatinib treatment. We conclude that sensitive molecular monitoring with real-time PCR for BCR-ABL1 transcripts and mutation screening of the ABL1 kinase domain of patients with Philadelphia-positive leukemias are valuable for patient management, however, mutation findings should be interpreted with caution, as mutant clones not always behave in vivo as predicted by in vitro assays.","title":"Molecular monitoring and mutation analysis of patients with advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL receiving dasatinib.","pubmedId":"20659155"}
