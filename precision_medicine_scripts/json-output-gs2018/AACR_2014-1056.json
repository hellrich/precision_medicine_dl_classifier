We showed here that PGE2 interacted with EP4 to increase phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), leading to increase in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and E-cadherin suppressors, notably Snail, ZEB1 and Twist. Prohibitin phosphorylated at threonine 258 (phospho-PHBT258) and MIG-7 played critical role in PGE2 effects respectively. Snail was regulated by phospho-PHBT258 via IKK/ and Ras/Raf-1 signaling pathways, whereas ZEB1 and Twist, were regulated mainly by MIG-7 that also sustained PGE2 effects via positive feedback on phospho-AktS473. Downregulating phospho-PHBT258 and MIG-7 showed additive effect in attenuating lung cancer migration/invasion/metastasis and prolonging disease-free and overall survival of xenograft mice. Our findings highlight the potential for combination therapy targeting phospho-PHBT258 and MIG-7 to block the COX-2/PGE2 effects on cancer metastasis.","title":"COX-2/PGE2-driven lung cancer invasion/metastasis is dependent on MIG-7 and phosphorylated prohibitin","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1056"}
