Adenoid cystic carcinoma may be difficult to differentiate from infiltrating duct carcinomas, and in particular from tubular and cribriform carcinomas, especially in core or vacuum-assisted biopsies. We evaluated the prevalence of c-kit, p63, and e-cadherin immunoreactivity in a series of 20 adenoid cystic carcinomas, comparing the results with those obtained in a series of infiltrating tubular carcinomas and infiltrating cribriform carcinomas. The hormone receptor status, proliferation labeling index, and HER/2 immunoreactivity had been previously investigated in all the cases. Three (15%) adenoid cystic carcinomas and all infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas showed estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor immunoreactivity (P \u003c 0.00001 for estrogen and P \u003d 0.00002 for progesterone receptors). Adenoid cystic carcinomas consistently lacked any immunoreactivity for HER/2, whereas three (15%) infiltrating and cribriform carcinomas showed weak and incomplete membrane staining (P \u003d 0.23077). Membranous immunoreactivity for c-kit was found in all except one (predominantly basaloid) adenoid cystic carcinomas (95%), and in none of the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas (P \u003c 0.00001). Nuclear immunoreactivity for p63 was found in all except three (predominantly basaloid) adenoid cystic carcinomas (85%) and in none of the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas (P \u003c 0.00001). All infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas and 18/20 (90%) adenoid cystic carcinomas showed immunoreactivity for e-cadherin (P \u003d 0.48718). In summary, adenoid cystic carcinomas showed the following phenotype: estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-/c-kit+/p63+ (13 cases, 65%), estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor/c-kit+/p63- (three cases, 15%), estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-/c-kit-/p63+ (one case, 5%), estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor+/c-kit+/p63+ (two cases, 10%), and estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor-/c-kit+/p63+ (one case). By contrast, all the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas showed the estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor+/c-kit-/p63- phenotype. Our data provide evidence that immunoreactivity for c-kit and/or p63 may be useful in differentiating adenoid cystic carcinomas from other types of breast cancer.","title":"Immunoreactivity for c-kit and p63 as an adjunct in the diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast.","pubmedId":"15846389"}
