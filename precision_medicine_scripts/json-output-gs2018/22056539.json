However, no attempts have been made to examine a wider range of salivary proteins in response to stress. In this study, we identified and quantified changes in the pattern of salivary protein release in a 45 min time period following the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in 12 asthmatic and 13 healthy participants. Proteins were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The relative protein amounts were quantified using the Image J software (NIH), and identified and characterized using mass spectroscopy. Negative affect was increased immediately after stress in both groups. The results showed that alpha amylase, cystatin S and light chain IgA were increased after the TSST and significant increases in glutathione S-transferase and prolactin inducible protein were also observed. Asthma patients showed responses similar to healthy controls, but had a tendency toward overall lower alpha amylase levels. Our findings suggest that a variety of proteins relevant to mucosal immunity are elevated following acute psychosocial stress, including glutathione S-transferase and prolactin inducible protein, which had not been characterized in this context before.","title":"Effects of psychosocial stress on the pattern of salivary protein release.","pubmedId":"22056539"}
