The histologic features were reviewed. Immunohistochemical study for CD30, ALK protein, epithelial membrane antigen, CD2, CD3, granzyme B and TIA-1 was carried out. In-situ hybridization for small mRNA of Epstein-Barr virus (EBER) was also performed. The chromosomal abnormalities were studied by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). The differences between ALK-positive and ALK-negative cases were statistically analyzed.\nThere were 48 cases of ALK-positive ALCL and 18 cases of ALK-negative ALCL. The patients with ALK-positive ALCL were younger than those with ALK-negative ALCL (P \u003c 0.05), with the median age being 18 years and 36 years, respectively. Fever, especially hyperpyrexia, was more commonly observed in ALK-positive ALCL patients than in ALK-negative ALCL patients (33 cases versus 4 cases, P \u003c 0.05). The overall survival rate and median duration of survival in patients with ALK-positive ALCL were higher and longer than those in patients with ALK-negative ALCL (80% versus 71%; 21 months versus 12.5 months, P \u003e 0.05). There were however no significant differences in histology between ALK-positive ALCL and ALK-negative ALCL. Histologically, most cases showed diffuse growth pattern. Nodular pattern was demonstrated in a minority of cases. \"Hallmark\" cells were seen in most of the ALCL cases. Focal necrosis and myxomatous stroma were identified in a few cases. Most ALK-positive cases belonged to the common variant (35 cases). A small number represented lymphohistiocytic variant (8 cases). Small cell variant and sarcomatoid subtype were found only in few cases (3 cases and 2 cases, respectively).On the other hand, common variant (17 cases) constituted the majority of ALK-negative ALCL. Lymphohistiocytic variant was seen in only 1 case. Immunohistochemical study showed that ALK-positive ALCL always expressed CD30 and epithelial membrane antigen. ALK-positive ALCL more often expressed epithelial membrane antigen (100% versus 72%; P \u003c 0.05) but less so for T-cell markers (including CD2, CD3, CD43 and CD45RO). Cytotoxic molecules were more commonly expressed in ALK-positive ALCL (P \u003e 0.05). EBER was negative in all cases studied. FISH showed that in ALK-positive ALCL, 1 case had normal ALK gene, 1 had deletion and multicopy and 2 had deletion. On the other hand, 1 case of ALK-negative ALCL had normal ALK gene.\nWhile there are no significant morphologic differences between ALK-positive ALCL and ALK-negative ALCL, the clinical features, immunophenotypes and genetic features of both groups vary. These differences are helpful in guiding the differential diagnosis.","title":"[Clinicopathologic features of 66 cases of anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive and negative systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma: a comparative study].","pubmedId":"20654121"}
