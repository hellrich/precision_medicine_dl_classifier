This symposium article is summarizing the information on HPV (p16) in the context of decision making in SCCHN patients with locoregionally advanced disease and those with recurrent/metastatic disease. The literature data suggest that HPV(p16) has prognostic significance, both in locoregionally advanced disease (in particular, in oropharynx cancer) and in recurrent/metastatic disease, while there are only limited data on its predictive significance. Results of HPV (p16) testing should not change management outside clinical trials.","title":"Human Papillomavirus (HPV): A Criterion for Therapeutic Decision in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck?","pubmedId":"27699535"}
