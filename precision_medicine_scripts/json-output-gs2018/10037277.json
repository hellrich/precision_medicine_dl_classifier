Almost all patients with primary gastric and esophageal carcinomas, and benign mucosa of the stomach and esophagus showed usually high levels of EGFR expression, a mean of approximately 60% of cells being positive. Metastatic gastric carcinoma showed significantly higher levels of EGFR expression, a mean of 80% of cells being positive. Reduced expression of EGFR was observed in irradiated esophageal carcinoma. Adenocarcinomas, including primary and metastatic lesions, or cancer cell lines of the stomach revealed consistently very low or undetectable levels of expression of exon v6 of the CD44 variant (CD44v) protein. However, CD44v containing exon v9 could be detected in normal gastric epithelium and primary gastric carcinoma as well as in six adenocarcinoma cell lines. Exon v9 is significantly overexpressed on metastatic adenocarcinoma cells obtained from malignant ascites. On the other hand, normal squamous epithelium and primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus, and two SCC cell lines showed coexpression of exons v6 and v9 of CD44v. The expression of the CD44v6 molecule was significantly reduced in the irradiated primary SCC, although CD44v9 expression on the primary SCC remained unchanged after the radiation therapy. These results suggest that up-regulation of EGFR and CD44v9 molecules on gastric carcinomas, especially metastatic adenocarcinomas, shows tumor growth and tumor progression. In addition, down-regulation of EGFR and CD44v6 molecules on irradiated esophageal carcinoma may be involved in the mechanisms suppressing tumor growth and metastatic potential.","title":"Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and CD44 splicing variants sharing exons 6 and 9 on gastric and esophageal carcinomas: a two-color flow-cytometric analysis.","pubmedId":"10037277"}
