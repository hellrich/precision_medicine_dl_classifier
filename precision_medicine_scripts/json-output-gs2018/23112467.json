{"keywords":["Cytodiagnosis","mucosal melanoma","nasal cavity"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Sinonasal malignant melanoma is of unusual occurrence. Common sites for melanomas are head, neck region, and the lower extremities as they are exposed to sunlight, which is one of the predisposing factors. We report a case of primary mucosal malignant melanoma of the nasal cavity in a 68-year-old male for its rare occurrence. The primary knowledge of its existence and evaluation of its cytological features are important for a correct preoperative cytological diagnosis and thereby clinical implications for appropriate therapeutic intervention. The cytological features when evaluated along with clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical features are sufficiently diagnostic. The rarity of its occurrence warrants its mention.","title":"Cytodiagnosis of mucosal malignant melanoma of nasal cavity: A case report with review of literature.","pubmedId":"23112467"}
