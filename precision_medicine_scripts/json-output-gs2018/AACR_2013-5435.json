This pathway can further activate downstream the p90- ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK). OBJECTIVES.- Since BRAF mutations increase melanoma progression which could lead to metabolic stress when oxygen, glucose, and other nutrients are limiting within poorly vascularized regions, we investigated whether hypoxia and metabolic stress can differentially influence the survival of human melanoma cells harbouring either wt or oncogenic BRAF. EXPERIMENTAL. human melanoma cells with unequal BRAF status were exposed to glucose and/or glutamine limitations under normoxia or hypoxia. Relative metabolic activity was fluorometrically quantitated by the cellular conversion of resazurin to resorufin. Differential cell survival was assesed by crystal violet staining. Mechanisms influencing the response to metabolic stress were studied by specific immune blotting. RESULTS. the metabolic activity and survival of melanoma cells harbouring oncogenic BRAF was preferentially decreased under hypoxia at sub-physiological glucose, compared to wt BRAF melanoma cells. Addition of the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine or pyruvate enhanced the metabolic activity and survival of wt BRAF cells, but these were much less effective when added to BRAF (V600E) mutant cells, implying a greater oxidative stress induced by low oxygen and glucose in them. Susceptibility to metabolic stress under hypoxia and low glucose in BRAF (V600E) mutant cells, correlated with persistent (p90RSK) activation but lower GLUT-1 and MnSOD expression. In contrast, wt BRAF melanoma cells resistant to metabolic stress reciprocally showed higher GLUT-1 and MnSOD expression, but negligible p90RSK activation. CONCLUSION.- Although mutations in BRAF can drive acquired resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors, our results suggest that restricting glucose consumption in hypoxic melanomas harbouring mutant BRAF with persistent phosphorylation of the p90-ribosomal S6 kinase, may contribute to their preferential killing.","title":"Increased tumor susceptibility to low glucose under hypoxia is increased by BRAF(V600E) mutation: correlation with persistent phosphoP90RSK activation.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-5435"}
