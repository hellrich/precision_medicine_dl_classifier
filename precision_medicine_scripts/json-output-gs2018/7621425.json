Zymogram analysis demonstrated that 72- and 92-kDa collagenases were associated only with metastatic TBJ. Three human neuroblastoma cell lines were then evaluated by zymogram and Western blot analyses: 72-kDa collagenase was found in metastatic SK-N-SH and IMR-32, but not in SK-N-MC, which may be a peripheral neuroectodermal tumor and not a neuroblastoma. Therefore, 72- and 92-kDa collagenases may be markers of metastasis in neuroblastoma and may aid in differentiation from other small blue cell tumors.","title":"Metastasis of C1300 and TBJ murine neuroblastomas correlates with expression of matrix metalloproteinases.","pubmedId":"7621425"}
