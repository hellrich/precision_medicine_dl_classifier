However, exact regulatory mechanisms mediating and controlling this phenomenon are still unknown. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of anti-Her-2/neu antibody on apoptosis of HER-2/neu overexpressing human breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3, HTB-24, HTB-25, HTB-27, HTB-128, HTB-130 and HTB-131 in relation to p53 genotype and bcl-2 status. SK-BR-3, HTB-24, HTB-128 and HTB-130 cells exhibited mutant p53, whereas wild type p53 was found in HTB-25, HTB-27 and HTB-131 cells. All seven cell lines weakly expressed bcl-2 protein (10-20%). Anti-Her-2/neu antibody, irrespective of p53 and bcl-2 status, induced apoptosis in all 7 cell lines dose- and time-dependently and correlated with Her-2/neu overexpression. In addition, incubation of cell lines with anti-Her-2/neu antibody did not alter p53 or bcl-2 expression. Anti-HER-2/neu antibody did not induce apoptosis in HER-2/neu negative HBL-100 and HTB-132 cell lines. Our results indicate that within the panel of tested breast cancer cell lines, anti-Her-2/neu antibody-induced apoptosis was independent from the presence of intact p53.","title":"Anti-Her-2/neu antibody induces apoptosis in Her-2/neu overexpressing breast cancer cells independently from p53 status.","pubmedId":"11742500"}
