We describe the case of a female who initially presented with localized skin disease associated with an insect bite. However, she subsequently relapsed with widespread systemic ALK-positive ALCL that included lymphoma deposits in the myocardium, a very rare manifestation. Her disease responded well to chemotherapy but she later developed a fatal relapse in the CNS. We also present data on an immune response to ALK, demonstrating a fluctuation in the levels of circulating antibodies to ALK corresponding to the different phases of her illness.","title":"Isolated cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma progressing to severe systemic disease with myocardial involvement and central nervous system infiltration.","pubmedId":"17914741"}
