In two out of five index patients, a second RET mutation (C634W or V804L) was detected.\nEight gene carriers were operated on. Histology revealed MTC and C-cell hyperplasia in three index and three screening patients respectively. In all other gene carriers (aged 41-64 years), calcitonin levels were in the normal range, and pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin levels were \u003c100 pg/ml. Therefore, thyroidectomy had not yet been performed. In one index patient carrying the S649L mutation, hyperparathyroidism was confirmed histologically. RET S649L-expressing NIH3T3 cells exhibited a clear increase of phosphotyrosine and proliferation rate when compared with parental NIH3T3 cells but a significantly lower kinase activity and cell growth rate when compared with RET C634R-expressing cells. When compared with RET C634R, the S649L mutant showed moderate transforming potential with small-sized colonies.\nOur clinical and in vitro findings indicate that the transmembrane RET S649L mutation is associated with late-onset non-aggressive disease. Recommendations for prophylactic thyroidectomy should be individualized depending on stimulated calcitonin levels.","title":"Characterization of the RET protooncogene transmembrane domain mutation S649L associated with nonaggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"18322301"}
