The median follow- up was 31 months. Patients with a positive NPM-ALK expression in BM had a 3-years EFS of (35.6±18.6)%, compared with (91.7±8.0)% for patients with negative NPM-ALK (P\u003d0.038). The incidence of positive expression in BM was significantly higher in patients who had more than 3 organs involved by tumor (P\u003d0.032). 86.7% patients had a concordant results of NPM-ALK expression in PB and BM.\nWe could evaluate the minimal disseminated disease of NPM-ALK positive ALCL patients by screening the NPM-ALK fusion gene in BM and PB by RT-PCR. The positive expression is associated with a poor prognosis and could be used for stratification of ALCL.","title":"[Prognostic significance of the NPM-ALK fusion gene in bone marrow and peripheral blood for patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma].","pubmedId":"23978023"}
