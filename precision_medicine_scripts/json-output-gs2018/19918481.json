{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Spontaneous regression of cancer is a rare, but well documented, phenomenon. We present a unique case of an 82 year old Chinese male who experienced spontaneous regression of histologically-verified metastatic type II papillary renal cell carcinoma in the absence of intervening systemic therapy or surgery. This is the first reported case of spontaneous regression of papillary renal cell carcinoma. The mechanism of spontaneous regression remains unknown, and represents a challenge for existing oncology paradigms.","title":"A unique case of spontaneous regression of metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma: a case report.","pubmedId":"19918481"}
