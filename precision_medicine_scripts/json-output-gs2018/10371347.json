The Japanese patients were significantly younger than the Anglo patients, while in premenopausal women the latter had significantly smaller tumors. The proportion of tumors expressing c-erbB2 and p53 proteins was similar in both populations. c-erbB2 positivity was significantly associated with positive lymph node status and with poorly differentiated carcinomas. Duration of relapse-free and overall survival was significantly longer in the Japanese women than in the Anglo women. Women with c-erbB2-negative tumors had a longer overall survival than women with c-erbB2-positive tumors and this difference was accentuated when patients were stratified according to country of origin. Japanese women with c-erbB2-negative tumors had the best outcome, whereas the Anglo women with c-erbB2-positive tumors had the worst. There was no relationship between p53 status and any histopathological features or clinical outcome. Differences in the expression of c-erbB2 and p53 do not explain the better outcome experienced by Japanese breast cancer patients.","title":"Expression of c-erbB2 and p53 protein is similar in breast cancer from British and Japanese women.","pubmedId":"10371347"}
