Green fluorescence protein (GFP) was linked to CD63, which is a general marker of exosomes, in order to track breast-cancer-cell-derived exosomes cancer in nude mice. Breast cancer cells transferred their own exosomes to other cancer cells and normal lung tissue cells in culture. In the nude mouse, breast cancer cells secreted GFP exosomes into the tumor micro environments as well as the circulation. Numerous GFP in exosomes were visualized in breast cancer metastases in nude mice. The results of this study suggest that tumor-derived exosomes may contribute to formation of a niche to promote metastasis.","title":"In vivo tracking of cancer-cell-derived exosomes","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1390"}
