Each type has distinct characters, allowing a good nosological definition. The histochemical methods, as well as lysozyme assay are usually unnecessary, particularly in well differenciated myeloblastic, promyelocytic or myelo-monocytic acute leukemia. They are, on the contrary, frequently useful in poorly differenciated myeloblastic or monoblastic leukemia. But, they cannot help to solve every problem in cytological diagnosis: there are still 10% of undifferenciated acute leukemia, the lymphoblastic acute leukemia are not clearly defined and 4% of cases of acute leukemia have atypical characters leading to difficulties in cytological classification. The need for new methods and markers is emphasized.","title":"[Cytological classification of adult acute leukemia (author\u0027s transl)].","pubmedId":"790273"}
