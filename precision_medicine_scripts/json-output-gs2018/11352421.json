A retrospective analysis of 1,996 patients presenting from 1990 to 1997 at the Pigmented Lesion Group of the University of Pennsylvania was performed to assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of locally recurrent melanoma. The cases were analyzed by chart and pathological slide review. A control group was identified for statistical comparison. The incidence of locally recurrent melanoma during the study period was 2.2%. Lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) accounted for 37% of the local recurrences. Increased tumor thickness and microsatellites were associated with \"early\" local recurrence and decreased survival from time of recurrence. Nineteen percent of the local recurrences occurred more than 5 years after the initial definitive treatment. The preponderance of locally recurrent LMM suggests the need for refinements in the techniques of margin identification and surgical excision of LMM. Tumors with increased thickness and microsatellites should receive particularly close attention. Lastly, with nearly 20% of the local recurrences occurring more than 5 years after the initial date of treatment, the authors suggest extending the follow-up time for all melanoma lesions beyond 5 years.","title":"Locally recurrent malignant melanoma characteristics and outcomes: a single-institution study.","pubmedId":"11352421"}
