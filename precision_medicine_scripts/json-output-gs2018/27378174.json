Populations of cells that survive after initial treatment form the basis of resistance via outgrowth of resistant clones or activation of alternative signaling pathways. In this report we describe a clinical trial approach in which patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), C-ros-1 proto-oncogene (ROS1), and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) exon 14 alterations and early stage (IA-IIIA) NSCLC will be treated with induction EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or crizotinib, a TKI that inhibits ALK, ROS1, and MET. We will evaluate resected tumor samples for pathologic response to induction therapy, overall response rate, and disease-free survival. Additionally, we will assess patients for early evidence of resistance to targeted therapy in terms of activation of alternative signaling pathways and for identification of resistance clones in remnant cell populations.","title":"Neoadjuvant Oncogene-Targeted Therapy in Early Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer as a Strategy to Improve Clinical Outcome and Identify Early Mechanisms of Resistance.","pubmedId":"27378174"}
