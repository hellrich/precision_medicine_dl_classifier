The primary objective was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vandetanib with RT +/- cisplatin.\nOf 33 treated patients, 30 completed therapy (regimen 1, n \u003d 12; regimen 2, n \u003d 18). MTD in regimen 2 was 100 mg (3 dose limiting toxicities [DLTs] at 200 mg), whereas regimen 1 was stopped because of poor recruitment (1 DLT at 200 mg). Most common grade â‰¥3 adverse events (AEs) were dysphagia (30%), stomatitis (33%), and mucosal inflammation (27%). Five patients discontinued vandetanib because of AEs.\nVandetanib with CRT was feasible.","title":"Phase I study of vandetanib with radiation therapy with or without cisplatin in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25352401"}
