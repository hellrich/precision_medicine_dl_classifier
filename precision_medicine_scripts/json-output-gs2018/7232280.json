It is thus important that each request for sterilization be considered on its own merits after full discussion with the patient, preferably with her husband.  2 groups of patients must be considered:  those who need to be sterilized and those who ask to be sterilized.  Those who need to be sterilized are those who have the potential for transmitting diseases or genetic diseases to the fetus, those who are over 40 years of age (the age when incidence of fetal abnormalities is significantly higher) and those with bad reproductive history (e.g., pre-eclampsia, intrauterine and neonatal deaths, antepartum hemorrhage) but with 2 or more normal surviving children.  Those who ask to be sterilized are usually women in their late 20\u0027s or early 30\u0027s.  There is a great need for counseling in this age group because of the potential for later regret.  The most effective sterilization methods with the least surgical complications are the laparoscopy and a minilaparotomy approach.  The commonest procedures are the operations on fallopian tubes.  Overall failure rate is around 3% for tubal ligation and 1% for laparoscopy, the rate increasing when 1) sterilization is performed at the same time as abortion; 2) operator is inexperienced; and 3) operating conditions are less than ideal.  Associated morbidity includes menorrhagia, posttraumatic adhesions; altered blood supply and changed hormonal balance.  Thorough counseling and proper timing of sterilization will ensure that all procedures are elective and risks of regret, failure and surgical complications will decline.","title":"Female sterilization.","pubmedId":"7232280"}
