Previous studies have shown that the T-box transcription factor brachyury is commonly expressed in advanced lung cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis. The activation of brachyury promotes lung cancer progression, aggressiveness and resistance to conventional antitumor therapies. However, the mechanism by which brachyury drives lung cancer is unknown. Here we have sought to identify novel gene targets of brachyury to better understand the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer. We used a bioinformatics approach and found a shortlist of putative potential brachyury target genes. We subsequently explored the modulation of candidate brachyury target genes in lung cancer. RNA interference analysis for lung cancer cell line H460 overexpressing brachyury demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), MAS1 Proto-Oncogene G Protein-Coupled Receptor (MAS1) and Ran GTPase Activating Protein 1 (RANGAP1) played essential roles in cell growth, whereas transmembrane protein 37 (TMEM37) was involved in cell migration and invasion. ChIP-qPCR experiments confirmed the strong binding of brachyury to these functional target genes. Analysis of datasets derived from patients with lung cancer and a panel of lung cancer cell lines revealed that brachyury expression was positively correlated with FGF8, MAS1, RANGAP1 and TMEM37. In addition, the expression levels of FGF8, MAS1 and RANGAP1 were significantly associated with non-metastasis (early-stage and locally advanced lung cancer), whereas TMEM37 was associated with metastasis. Taken together, our findings suggest that brachyury may influence lung cancer progression and/or metastasis via direct regulation of FGF8, MAS1, RANGAP1 and TMEM37 expression. Identification of potential brachyury transcriptional targets provides novel insights into the molecular pathobiology of lung cancer.","title":"Identification of novel brachyury target genes in lung cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2021"}
