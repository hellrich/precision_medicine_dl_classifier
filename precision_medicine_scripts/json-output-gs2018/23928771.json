Mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway have been identified and represent potential targets for therapy in this disease. BRAF, a serine/threonine kinase, has received considerable attention given the success of targeted therapy in malignant melanoma. Andrulis and colleagues report, for the first time, successful treatment of multiple myeloma with vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, in a patient with a BRAF mutation.","title":"Targeting BRAF in multiple myeloma.","pubmedId":"23928771"}
