The migration of peripheral leukocytes from malignant melanoma patients was significantly inhibited in the presence of malignant melanoma antigen in 50% of examined patients and only in 2 cases in controls. The blocking activity of serum on migration inhibition was observed in 3 melanoma patients. From the results of the tests performed related to the two-years-course of the disease the conclusion may be drawn that the prognosis in patients with proved cellular hypersensitivity to malignant melanoma antigen is more favorable than in anergic individuals.","title":"The cell-mediated immunity in patients with malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"683378"}
