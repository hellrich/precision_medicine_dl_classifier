These chromosomal rearrangements are nonetheless among the many determinants that underlie transformation of cells from normal to a cancerous phenotype and predispose cells to refractoriness against interventions by reduced drug influx and substantial drug efflux. This review unfolds current understanding of BCR-ABL1 (break point cluster region-c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) signaling with a focus on apoptotic suppressive mechanisms and alternative approaches to chronic myeloid leukemia therapy.","title":"BCR-ABL1 in leukemia: disguise master outplays riding shotgun.","pubmedId":"23575066"}
