A sharply demarcated tumor, measuring 3 X 4 cm, was located in the right frontal lobe. The mass grey and cystic in the center, and microscopic specimen demonstrated bizarre, irregular, giant cell with a long vesicular nuclei and spindle-shaped cell. A perivascular pseudo-rosette formation also was seen, and silver impregnation revealed reticulin network and extracellular collagen fibers. The pathological entity of an intracranial giant celled glioblastoma remains controversial. This entity is considered a giant celled glioblastoma by some and a monstrocellular sarcoma by others. In this that the authors experienced, a CT scan showed a ring that formed a high density area and low density in the center at the right frontal lobe. Also reviewed and discussed are the historical aspects of a giant celled glioblastoma and radiologic problems that have been encountered.","title":"[A giant cell glioblastoma--a case report].","pubmedId":"2704140"}
