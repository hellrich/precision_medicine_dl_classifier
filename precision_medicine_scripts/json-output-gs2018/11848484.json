The AIN-76A diet was supplemented with 0.7% L-methionine from week 4 after birth and the animals were killed at week 8. The number of tumours in Min mice was apparently not affected by the addition of extra methionine. However, the dietary methionine supplementation increased the surface area of small intestinal tumours by 41% (p\u003d0.009). In the colon, extra methionine did not affect tumour size. In conclusion, extra dietary methionine promotes the growth of adenomas in the small intestine of Min mice.","title":"Growth stimulation of intestinal tumours in Apc(Min/+) mice by dietary L-methionine supplementation.","pubmedId":"11848484"}
