Thus, more thyroidectomies, based on an abnormal pentagastrin test, can be expected. Here we give summarizing recommendations for reporting C cell pathology.\nAll patients underwent total thyroidectomy and were tested for germ-line mutations in the RET-Protooncogene. The entire surgical specimens were blocked and C-cell disorders were assessed using conventional histology and immunohistochemistry.\nAmong 110 patients with an abnormal pentagastrin test, 60 (55%) had medullary thyroid carcinoma (T1 34% [n \u003d 37], T2 14% [n \u003d 16], T4 6% [n \u003d 7]), and 50 (45%) had C cell hyperplasia only. C cell hyperplasia accompanying medullary thyroid carcinoma was found in 13 of 15 familial and in 28 of 45 sporadic patients. All C cell changes were found in the upper two thirds of the thyroid lobes and 83% of the medullary thyroid carcinomas could be identified with frozen sections.\n1. Abnormal pentagastrin stimulation is always associated with either medullary thyroid carcinoma or C cell hyperplasia. 2. Blocking of the entire upper two thirds of the thyroid lobes is essential for reliable detection of C cell hyperplasia and small medullary thyroid carcinomas. 3. Most medullary thyroid carcinomas can be detected with intraoperative frozen sections. 4. The presence of C cell hyperplasia should always be reported; however its usefulness for indicating familial risk is limited and its role as a preneoplastic condition in patients without RET-protooncogene mutations remains to be elucidated.","title":"Recommendations for reporting C cell pathology of the thyroid.","pubmedId":"12089863"}
