Recently, gene profiling can be available, and immunohistochemical surrogates for molecular subtyping can provide much of prognostic and predictive factors. We investigated the relationship between compliance with consensus recommendations and clinical outcome of each subtype on the hypothesis that conformity with consensus recommendations is associated with increased survival among all intrinsic subtypes.  Methods:    We investigated breast cancer patients operated in our hospital from 2002 to 2004. DCIS, Stage 4 and male breast cancer were excluded. Patients were divided into luminal A (ER+ and/or PgR+, HER2-, low nuclear grade (NG)), luminal B (ER+ and/or PgR+, HER2-, high NG), luminal-HER2 (ER+ and/or PgR+, HER2+), HER2 (ER-, PgR-, HER2+) and triple negative (TN), (ER-, PgR-, HER2-). All patients were divided into compliance group or non-compliance group according to their conformity with consensus recommendations. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used in statistical studies.  Results:    121 breast cancer patients were eligible and investigated in this study. Median follow-up period was 6.7 years. Fifteen relapse cases (12.4%) were identified. Among luminal A patients, compliance group was significantly associated with better recurrence free survival compared with non-compliance group with Kaplan-Meier analysis (p\u003c0.001). In contrast, there was no difference between compliance group and non-compliance group among the other subtypes. Median time to recurrence (4.2 year) in non-compliance group among luminal A was apparently longer than that (1.7 year) in compliance group among the other subtypes.   Conclusions:    Compliance group was significantly associated with better clinical outcome compared with non-compliance group among luminal A. This study suggests that cautious follow-up is required against non-compliance patients among luminal A, because time to recurrence of them was longer than that of both compliance and non-compliance subgroups among the other subtypes.","title":"Compliance with consensus recommendations for systemic therapy, breast cancer intrinsic subtype, and clinical outcome.","pubmedId":"ASCO_86504-111"}
