The V600E mutation was found in 0 (0%) of 13 samples diagnosed histologically as Spitz nevi, 9 (24.3%) of 37 invasive melanomas, and 5 (100%) of 5 other melanocytic nevi. Two additional mutations, V600K and VK600-1E, also were identified in cases of invasive melanoma. We analyzed 14 paraffin-embedded papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) samples, 6 of which showed the V600E mutation. We found that our test worked efficiently with fine-needle aspirate specimens, and it identified 6 V600E mutations in 10 fine-needle aspirate specimens diagnosed as PTC. We also identified 4 V600E mutations in 6 specimens of PTC metastatic to lymph node. Unlike the melanocytic lesions, the PTC specimens yielded only V600E mutations. Comparison of our real-time polymerase chain reaction results with conventional polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing demonstrated 100% concordance. Surprisingly, we did not identify the previously reported VK600-1E or K601E mutations in our PTC specimens.\nOur results show that the real-time polymerase chain reaction method is a rapid and accurate method for identifying BRAF mutations, such as V600E, in both paraffin-embedded tissue and fine-needle aspirate specimens.","title":"BRAF mutations in melanocytic lesions and papillary thyroid carcinoma samples identified using melting curve analysis of polymerase chain reaction products.","pubmedId":"17824790"}
