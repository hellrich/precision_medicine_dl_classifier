We previously showed that the in vitro OVA-pulsed dendritic cell (DC(OVA))-activated CD4(+) Th cells acquired OVA peptide/MHC (pMHC) class I and costimulatory molecules such as CD54 and CD80 from DC(OVA) and acted as CD4(+) Th-APC capable of stimulating OVA-specific CD8(+) CTL responses. In this study, we further applied the OVA-specific TCR-transgenic OT I and OT II mice with deficiency of various cytokines or costimulatory molecule genes useful for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying in Th-APC\u0027s stimulatory effect. We demonstrated that DC(OVA)-stimulated OT II CD4(+) Th-APC also acquired costimulatory molecules such as CD40, OX40L, and 4-1BBL and the functional pMHC II complexes by DC(OVA) activation. CD4(+) Th-APC with acquired pMHC II and I were capable of stimulating CD4(+) Th1 and central memory CD8(+)44(+)CD62L(high)IL-7R(+) T cell responses leading to antitumor immunity against OVA-expressing mouse B16 melanoma. Their stimulatory effect on CD8(+) CTL responses and antitumor immunity is mediated by IL-2 secretion, CD40L, and CD80 signaling and is specifically targeted to CD8(+) T cells in vivo via acquired pMHC I. In addition, CD4(+) Th-APC expressing OVA-specific TCR, FasL, and perforin were able to kill DC(OVA) and neighboring Th-APC expressing endogenous and acquired pMHC II. Taken together, we show that CD4(+) Th-APC can modulate immune responses by stimulating CD4(+) Th1 and central memory CD8(+) T cell responses and eliminating DC(OVA) and neighboring Th-APC. Therefore, our findings may have great impacts in not only the antitumor immunity, but also the regulatory T cell-dependent immune tolerance in vivo.","title":"CD4+ Th-APC with acquired peptide/MHC class I and II complexes stimulate type 1 helper CD4+ and central memory CD8+ T cell responses.","pubmedId":"19109150"}
