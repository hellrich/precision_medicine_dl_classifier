Hypercalcaemia may present in patients with advanced or disseminated head and neck cancer, and, as such, these patients may present to a larger variety of clinicians for advice concerning their symptoms and illness. Modes of presentation of hypercalcaemia and treatment strategies are reviewed.\nThere were previously few large series of head and neck cancer patients diagnosed with hypercalcaemia, which may or may not have been related to their cancer being treated. Investigations, by way of blood/serum calcium level, may identify such patients. Patients with cancer-related hypercalcaemia have a poor prognosis, but many may respond temporarily to treatment when offered, with an improvement of their quality of life and death.\nHypercalcaemia should and must be considered in all patients who have or possibly have a diagnosis of a head and neck cancer and who present unwell with symptoms of fatigue, lethargy and somnolence. Investigation must include serum calcium (corrected for serum albumin binding) and parathyroid hormone level. Patients may be treated by a combination of rehydration and bisulphonate therapy until the serum calcium is reduced to a level below 3 mmol/l. The majority of patients diagnosed with hypercalcaemia due to head and neck malignancy die of their diseases in the short term, but some may enjoy a prolongation of life with reasonable quality if diagnosed and treated aggressively.","title":"Hyercalcaemia in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16552258"}
