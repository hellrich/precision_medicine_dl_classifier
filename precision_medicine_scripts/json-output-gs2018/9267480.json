The favorable trends were even larger in middle and younger age males, but not in children below age 15, whose overall age-standardized cancer mortality rates increased for the fourth subsequent year. Lung cancer was the leading site of cancer mortality, with over 30,900 deaths. For the fifth subsequent year, its rates in males declined, to reach 56.0/100,000. The decline in lung cancer rates is now established in Italian males and is substantial in middle age, whereas the rise in female lung cancer rates seems to have leveled off over the last few years. Rates for other major cancer sites (intestines, stomach, female breast, prostate, pancreas, leukemias and lymphomas) were stable, but some decrease was apparent also in 1993 for Hodgkin\u0027s disease.\nItalian cancer mortality rates in 1993 were moderately favorable in males, due to the leveling of the tobacco-related epidemic, whereas no appreciable change was registered in females. The persisting unfavorable trends in childhood cancer mortality should be investigated.","title":"Cancer mortality in Italy, 1993.","pubmedId":"9267480"}
