Recent studies have shown that maspin sub-cellular distribution may impact its effect on disease outcome. Similar studies are missing in melanoma. Methods: Using 3 different tissue microarrays (TMA), Maspin expression was evaluated by two pathologists in a blinded manner on 150 primary lesions and 106 metastasis obtained by melanoma patients. Maspin expression in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments were evaluated separately and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics (logistic model) and disease-free survival (Cox model) of patients included in the study. Results: Maspin was expressed in nuclei of 52% and in cytoplasms of 17% samples of primary melanomas. Nuclear maspin expression was significantly associated with melanoma thickness (p\u003c0.0001), mitotic rate (p\u003c0.0001), ulceration (p\u003d0.003), LN involvement (p\u003d0.0005) and worse prognosis (p\u003d0.02). On the contrary, higher cytoplasmic expression was observed in patients with thin lesions (p\u003d0.007), with mitotic rate \u003c1/mm2 (p\u003c0.005), no LN involvement (p\u003d0.012), and better prognosis (p\u003d0.05). Metastatic samples showed Maspin expression in the nuclei of 33% cases and in the cytoplasms of 10% cases, showing a progressive lost of expression with disease spreading. Conclusion: Our study shows a compartment-dependent effect of maspin expression in primary and metastatic melanomas. Further studies will be aimed to dissect the biological significance of maspin expression and localization during disease progression.","title":"Evaluation of maspin expression in primary tumors and metastasis of melanoma patients: Evidences for prognostic significance","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5556"}
