This international study was designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in pts \u003c 18yrs based on maximum tolerated dose, or systemic exposure similar to that seen in adult pts (AUC, 40005500 ng*h/mL), whichever came first.  Methods:  Dabrafenib was given orally twice daily, beginning at 3.0mg/kg/day. Toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and response were assessed by disease-appropriate criteria at each dose for pts \u003e 12yrs and  12yrs. Doses of 3.0, 3.75, 4.5, and 5.25mg/kg/day were assessed by a rolling six design. When a dose level was filled and under assessment, additional pts could join the previous dose level deemed tolerable.  Results:  Enrollment for phase 1 completed at 27 pts, 15 male, median age 9yrs (range 117), with HGG n \u003d 8, LGG n \u003d 15, LCH n \u003d 2, and OST n \u003d 2. One pt had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 3 maculopapular rash (MR) at 4.5mg/kg/day, but is on study 9mths after restarting dabrafenib at 3.75mg/kg/day. Serious adverse events judged related to dabrafenib included MR (1 pt); hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, fever (1 pt, outside DLT period); and arthralgia (1 pt). Duration on study ranged from 9wks to 19mo (ongoing); 20 pts remain on treatment. The RP2D for pts \u003e 12yrs is 4.5mg/kg/day (median AUC 5285) and 5.25mg/kg/day (median AUC 4384) for  12yrs. Investigator-assessed best radiographic responses included 3 complete response (CR), 3 partial response (PR) and 2 progressive disease (PD) in HGG; 8 PR, 6 stable disease (SD) and 1 PD in LGG; 2 CR in LCH; 1 SD and 1 PD in OST (source data verification ongoing).  Conclusions:  The RP2D of dabrafenib for children \u003e 12yrs and for those  12 was determined based on the target AUC when taken twice daily. The drug was well-tolerated with manageable toxicity. A high proportion of pts demonstrated radiographic responses in this phase 1 trial in different BRAF V600E-positive tumors. The disease stratified phase 2 component of the study is underway (NCT01677741).
