Our objective was to evaluate the suitability of FLT3-ITD as a target for MRD detection by real-time quantitative PCR, in comparison with two other molecular MRD markers, NPM1 mutation and WT1 overexpression, in 20 adult AML patients treated in Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) trials. Overall, these 3 MRD markers showed comparable kinetics in 17/20 (85%) cases. Furthermore, we found that FLT3-ITD MRD levels after induction chemotherapy are predictive of complete remission duration.","title":"Minimal residual disease monitoring based on FLT3 internal tandem duplication in adult acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"22129478"}
