In this paper we will describe the production of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to human NB cell lines. The hybridomas were selected by ELISA and immunofluorescence for antibody binding to multiple human neuroblastoma cultured cell lines, but not to hematopoietic cells and leukemic cells. The mAbs were characterized in terms of their ability to bind to human cell lines and tissues. The IgG2a and IgG2b mAbs may prove useful in the diagnosis of therapy of neuroblastoma.","title":"Monoclonal antibodies against neuroblastoma.
