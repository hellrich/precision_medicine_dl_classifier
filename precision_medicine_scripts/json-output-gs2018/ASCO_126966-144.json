An increasing number of potentially actionable alterations (PAAs) can be targeted by small molecules and antibodies. Since most patients (pts) do not have PAAs detectable by conventional clinical assays, NGS may identify these targets and increase treatment options. To determine the clinical impact of extensive genetic profiling, we reviewed our experience using a targeted NGS platform (FoundationOne) in advanced cancer pts.  Methods:  We retrospectively assessed demographics, NGS results, and therapies received for pts undergoing targeted NGS (exonic sequencing of 236 genes and selective intronic sequencing from 19 genes) from April 2012 to August 2013. PAAs were defined as somatic genetic changes inferred to confer sensitivity to approved or investigational agents. Co-primary endpoints were the proportion of pts with PAAs uncovered by NGS and the proportion who received genotype-directed therapy (GDT).  Results:  Samples from 103 pts were tested; most frequently breast carcinoma (26%), head and neck cancers (23%), and melanoma (10%). Most samples (83%) harbored 1 PAA; 6% had no detected mutations. Identified PAAs included alterations in the following pathways: cell cycle regulation (44%), PI3K-AKT (31%), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (19%); TP53 was the most commonly altered gene (32%). With median follow up of 4.1 months, 21% received GDT. Of these, 61% were on clinical trials and 39% received approved or off-label GDT; several heavily pre-treated pts experienced significant benefit. Rationale for not administering GDT to pts with PAAs included assignment to standard therapy during follow up (35%) and clinical deterioration (13%).Additionally, a novel BRAF fusion was identified in melanoma.  Conclusions:  A targeted NGS panel identified PAAs in the majority of advanced cancer pts in our experience. The assay identified treatment options, facilitated enrollment in clinical trials, and identified novel PAAs. As time progresses, NGS results will be used to guide therapy in an increasing proportion of pts.","title":"Enabling a genetically informed approach to cancer medicine: A retrospective evaluation of the impact of comprehensive tumor profiling using a targeted next-generation sequencing panel.","pubmedId":"ASCO_126966-144"}
