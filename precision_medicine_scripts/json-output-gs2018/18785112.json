Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 97 melanomas including 69 cases of primary and 28 metastatic melanomas were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Five melanoma cell lines were evaluated by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. Fli-1 expression was observed in all cell lines. Fli-1 expression was higher in metastatic than in primary tumors (r\u003d0.208, p\u003d0.041, Spearman correlation), it positively correlated with Ki-67 expression (r\u003d0.233, p\u003d0.022, Spearman correlation), and the presence of an ulcer in the primary tumor (r\u003d0.267, p\u003d0.030, Spearman correlation). Therefore, the expression of Fli-1 in malignant melanoma appears to be associated with biologically more aggressive tumors.","title":"Fli-1 expression in malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"18785112"}
