Moreover, BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 2 of 8 fresh FNAB specimens and 6 of 10 patients\u0027 FNAB slides.\nWe demonstrated for the first time that it is feasible to detect a BRAF mutation from a small number of fresh FNAB specimens or slides in China, suggesting that detection of BRAF mutation on FNAB samples is useful not only for preoperative diagnosis of PTC but also for accurate pathologic diagnosis and prognosis.","title":"Detection of BRAF mutation on fine needle aspiration biopsy specimens: diagnostic and clinical implications for papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"20518413"}
