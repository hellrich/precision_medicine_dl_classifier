Since only limited data exist on patients receiving later-line treatment with EGFR-targeted therapy and outcome in relation to RAS status, we analyzed the mutational status of RAS and BRAF in 480 patients receiving cetuximab and irinotecan. All patients were prior treated with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Methods: A Danish national cohort of 480 consecutive patients with mCRC prior treated with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan who received at least one treatment of cetuximab plus irinotecan from 2005 to 2009 without knowledge of KRAS/RAS status were retrospectively included. DNA was extracted from primary tumor specimens. Sequencing analyses of KRAS (exons 2, 3, 4), NRAS (exons 2, 3, 4), BRAF(V600E) were performed on Ion Torrent PGM. No tissue microdissection was performed. A  5% mutant allele cutoff was used to call mutations with 100X coverage. Results:RAS and BRAF mutational status was assessed in 448 (93 %) patients. Totally, 278 patients (62%) were KRAS (exon 2) wt,237 (53%) RAS wt, 418 (93 %) BRAF wtand 207 (46%) were RAS/BRAF wt. Fifty-seven patients were not assessable for response evaluation. The overall response rate for the 480 patients was 18%. Patients with RAS wt tumors had a significant better progression-free survival (PFS) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.60 (CI 0.490.73; p \u003c 0.0001), overall survival (OS) HR 0.75 (CI 0.620.90; p \u003d 0.002) and odds ratio (OR) for response OR 4.8 (CI 2.678.66; p \u003c 0.0001) compared with patients with RAS mutated tumors. For patients with RAS/BRAFwt tumors we found a HR of 0.55 (CI 0.450.66; p \u003c 0.0001) for PFS, a HR 0.68 (CI 0.560.82; p \u003c 0.0001) for OS and an OR for a response were OR 4.6 (CI 2.698.12; p \u003c 0.0001). Conclusions: Our data suggest that in later-line treatment of mCRC, patients with RAS and BRAF wt tumors are significantly associated with outcome.","title":"Outcome of cetuximab plus irinotecan in relation to RAS and BRAF mutational status in patients with colorectal cancer prior treated with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan.","pubmedId":"ASCO_165500-176"}
