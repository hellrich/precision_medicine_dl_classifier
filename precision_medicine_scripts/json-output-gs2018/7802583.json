Thirty-four (61%) were white, and the remaining 22 (39%) were African-American, Hispanic, or Asian. Thirty (54%) were male and 26 (46%) were female. The primary tumor occurred on the lower extremity in 46 (82%) of the cases and on the upper extremity in the remaining 10 (18%). Twenty-four primary tumors (43%) were greater than 4.00 mm thick. Analyzed by means of a logistic regression model, the rate of lymph node metastases did not significantly differ among patients with acral lentiginous melanoma, superficial spreading melanoma, and nodular malignant melanoma. Furthermore, when corrected for tumor thickness, disease-free and overall survival were the same for the three histologic groups. Multifactorial analysis identified only thickness as a prognostic variable for disease-free survival and overall survival.\nDespite the greater age, diverse ethnic background, and distinctive tumor characteristics of our patients with acral lentiginous melanoma, this histologic subtype does not, in itself, affect the outcome of these patients.","title":"Acral lentiginous melanoma.","pubmedId":"7802583"}
