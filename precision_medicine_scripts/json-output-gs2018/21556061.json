Although attenuation of PTEN function has a major role in tumourigenesis, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that α-mannosidase 2C1 (MAN2C1) inhibits PTEN function in prostate cancer (PC) cells and is associated with a reduction in PTEN function in primary PC. MAN2C1 activates AKT and promotes the formation of PTEN-positive DU145 cell-derived xenograft tumours by imparing endogenous PTEN function. In 659 PC patients who were examined, ~60% of tumours were PTEN positive with elevated AKT activation. Of these, 80% display MAN2C1 overexpression that co-localizes with PTEN. Increases in MAN2C1 were detected only in PTEN-positive prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinomas, and showed a significant association with PC recurrence only in patients with PTEN-positive PCs. Mechanistically, MAN2C1 binds PTEN thereby inhibiting its PIP(3) phosphatase activity. These findings show that MAN2C1 function as a PTEN-negative regulator in PC cells.","title":"α-Mannosidase 2C1 attenuates PTEN function in prostate cancer cells.","pubmedId":"21556061"}
