For several years, sorafenib has been approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma. After previous studies showing that sorafenib was able to inhibit oncogenic RET mutants, (V600E)BRAF, and angiogenesis and growth of orthotopic anaplastic thyroid cancer xenografts in nude mice, some clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness of sorafenib in advanced thyroid cancer. Currently, the evaluation of the clinical safety and efficacy of sorafenib for the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer is ongoing. This article reviews the anti-neoplastic effect of sorafenib in thyroid cancer. Several completed (or ongoing) studies have evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib in patients with papillary and medullary aggressive thyroid cancer. The results suggest that sorafenib is a promising therapeutic option in patients with advanced thyroid cancer that is not responsive to traditional therapeutic strategies.
