{"genes":["KIT mutations","mut","KIT mut"],"publicationTypes":["2009 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: Three prior phase II studies of Imatinib mesylate (IM) in 62 pts with advanced melanoma reported only 1 response in a pt with acral melanoma. A proportion of melanomas arising from acral, mucosal, and chronic sun damaged (CSD) sites are characterized by KIT mutations (mut) or amplifications (amp) and we hypothesized that this subset of tumors would be sensitive to IM. We thus designed this phase II study of IM restricted to pts with melanoma harboring such alterations in KIT. Methods: Pts with unresectable melanoma arising from acral, mucosal, and CSD sites whose tumor harbored a 4q12 amp by FISH or mut in KIT and who had measureable disease by RECIST were eligible. Pts received IM 400 mg BID continually. Response was assessed every cycle (6 wks). A Simon 2-stage design was employed where initially 16 pts would be treated; if  2 responses were observed, a total of 25 pts would be enrolled. If 5 responses were seen in 25 pts, the study was to be considered positive. Results: Of 81 pt tumors screened, 17 (21%) had a KIT mut or amp: 5/22 (23%) acral, 12/45 (27%) mucosal, 0/13 (0%) CSD, 0/1 (0%) unknown primary. 12 (15%) had a mut only; 4 (5%) had an amplification only; 1 (2%) had both. Thus far, 7 have been treated, with 5 currently evaluable for response. Median age: 64 yrs (range, 61-86); 2 male/5 female; median KPS: 90 (range, 80- 90); median # of prior therapies: 1 (range, 0-4). 3 pts (43%) achieved a PR (18 wks - exon 13 mut; 21 wks, ongoing - exon 11 mut; 18 wks, ongoing - exon 11 mut \u0026 amp); 2 pts (28%) achieved SD (12 wks - exon 11 mut; 11 wks - amp). 3 pts required a dose reduction to 400 mg QD for rash, GI toxicity and fatigue. 1 pt required a second dose reduction to 300 mg QD for visual changes. Conclusions: In this pt population, 21% of tumors are characterized by mut or amp of KIT. The 3 responses observed have allowed expansion to the second stage of enrollment which is currently on-going. While IM has limited activity in a non-selected melanoma pt population, a substantial proportion of melanomas harboring KIT mut or amp appear to respond. It may be possible to identify appropriate pts prospectively for treatment with IM.
