To elucidate the role of 5q loss in FAP tumorigenesis, we analysed 51 colorectal tumors and seven desmoids from 19 cases of FPC and five GS patients, as well as 15 sporadic colon cancers. RFLP analysis revealed a high incidence of allelic deletion in hereditary colon cancers as well as in sporadic colon cancers with a peak at the APC locus. APC loss resulted primarily from interstitial deletion or mitotic recombination. Combined tumor and pedigree analysis in a GS family revealed loss of normal 5q alleles in three tumors, including a desmoid tumor, which suggests the involvement of hemizygosity or homozygosity of the defective APC gene in colon carcinogenesis and, possibly, in extracolonic neoplasms associated with FAP.","title":"Molecular nature of chromosome 5q loss in colorectal tumors and desmoids from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.","pubmedId":"2172153"}
