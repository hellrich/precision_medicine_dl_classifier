The objective of this work was to evaluate the EGFR and c-erbB-2 levels in non-resectable gastric carcinomas, their possible relationship with a variety of clinicopathological tumor parameters, and their prognostic significance.\nThis was a prospective analysis of 65 patients with unresectable gastric carcinomas (UICC R1 or R2), who underwent palliative surgery and were followed up for a median period of 13 months. Membranous EGFR levels were examined by radioligand binding assays and cytosolic c-erbB-2 levels by means of an immunoenzymatic assay.\nThere was a wide variability in EGFR (80.3-2910 fmol/mg of protein) and c-erbB-2 (0.4-10071 NHU/mg of protein) levels in neoplastic tissues from patients with unresectable gastric carcinomas. Median c-erbB2 was significantly higher in tumors of the intestinal type than in tumors of the diffuse type (p \u003d 0.035) and in R2 than in R1 tumors (p \u003d 0.016). Statistical analysis showed that there was no relationship between tumor c-erbB-2 or EGFR content and any other patient or tumor characteristics. However, high levels of EGFR were significantly associated with a shorter overall survival (p \u003d 0.01).\nOur data suggest a role of both transmembrane proteins in the progression of gastric cancer. EGFR and c-erbB-2 contents in unresectable gastric cancer could be utilized as appropriate biological markers for selecting candidates for treatment based on EGFR and/or c-erbB-2 inhibition.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor and c-erbB-2 contents in unresectable (UICC R1 or R2) gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"14535591"}
