These markers may serve as prognostic and/or predictive factors for recurrence following resection and resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Gene expression levels of thymidylate synthase (TS), thymidylate phosphorylase (TP), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and excision repair cross complementing (ERCC-1) have been shown to be associated with outcomes in lung, gastric and colon cancer. We evaluated TS, ERCC-1, EGFR and TP gene expression levels in patients with UGI cancers. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 80 pts with UGI cancers evaluated at USC who underwent molecular profiling. The primary objective was to determine a correlation between TS, TP, ERCC1 and EGFR and correlate with clinical outcome. Characteristics of these 80 pts: (16 females, 64 males ); median age 61 years (range 34-85); tumor types evaluated - 32 (40%) esophageal, 24(30%) gastric, 24(30%) GE junction; stages- 53 % IV, 21% III, 12% II, 2% I were evaluated for intratumoral gene expression of TS, TP, ERCC-1, \u0026 EGFR by real time quantitative PCR using Taqman technology from microdisected paraffin-embedded tumor sections. Results: High TS expression was associated with shorter OS (12.8 months vs. 23.7 months p\u003d0.036). A significant correlation was found between TP \u0026 ERCC-1 (p\u003d0.0078, r\u003d0.37); TP \u0026 TS (p\u003d0.0128, r\u003d0.35); TP \u0026 EGFR (p\u003d0.0065, r\u003d0.39); TS \u0026 ERCC-1 (p\u003d0.0004, r\u003d0.39); ERCC-1 \u0026 EGFR (p\u003d0.025, r\u003d0.30). No statistically significant relationship was found between TS \u0026 EGFR (p\u003d0.06 ,r\u003d0.25). There was no correlation of ERCC-1, TP, \u0026 EGFR with OS that reached statistical significance. Conclusions: TS mRNA levels were shown to be associated with OS in UGI tumors, consistent with data reported in colon cancer. TS gene expression was significantly associated with expression levels of ERCC-1. In addition, ERCC1 was associated with EGFR. These data show for the first time that molecular pathways of cytotoxic agents are linked to the EGFR pathway suggesting that sensitivity to fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, and EGFR inhibitors may be associated.","title":"Molecular profiling in patients (pts) with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers correlated with clinical outcome.","pubmedId":"ASCO_35374-65"}
