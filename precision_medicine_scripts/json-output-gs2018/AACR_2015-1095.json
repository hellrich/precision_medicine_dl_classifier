To address this we are currently developing a new method to map PI3K/AKT/mTOR network activity. It uses TCGA reverse-phase protein array data and is based on correlations between active pathway members. This approach provides evidence the WNT pathway is active in the Mesenchymal subgroup and we are currently validating these results. Based on this data we hypothesize Mesenchymal patients will respond to WNT inhibitors.","title":"In silico mapping of oncogene networks implicate the WNT pathway in the glioblastoma MES subtype","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-1095"}
