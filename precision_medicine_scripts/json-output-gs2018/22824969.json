The PubMed, Web of Science and EBSCO databases were searched from their inceptions to February 1, 2012. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% conÔ¨Ådence intervals (CIs) were extracted and pooled to assess the strength of the association between p16 hypermethylation and breast cancer risk. A total of eight studies, including 691 breast cancer cases and 525 control cases, were identified for meta-analysis. Statistically significant ORs of p16 hypermethylation were obtained from the breast cancer and control groups (OR, 6.58; 95% CI, 1.15-37.75; P\u003d0.03). However, no significant associations between the methylation and ER and PR status in breast cancer were detected (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.64-2.41; P\u003d0.52; OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.81-2.75; P\u003d0.20, respectively). The meta-analysis indicated that p16 hypermethylation significantly increases breast cancer risk. However, no significant associations between the methylation and ER and PR status in breast cancer were detected.","title":"p16 promoter hypermethylation is associated with increased breast cancer             risk.","pubmedId":"22824969"}
