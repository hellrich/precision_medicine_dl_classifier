Methylation was often observed for the two major suppressor genes involved in cell-cycle control through the Cdk-Rb-E2F signaling pathway, RB1 (18/105, 17%) and p16 (59/105, 56%); both genes were methylated in 13 tumors. Methylation involved p15 in two (2%) tumors; CDH1, in 83 (79%) tumors; MGMT, in eight (8%) tumors, and N33, in nine (9%) tumors. The p14 promoter was not methylated in the tumors examined.","title":"[Abnormal methylation of several tumor suppressor genes in sporadic breast cancer].","pubmedId":"12942643"}
