HER-2/neu status has also been tested for its ability to predict the response of breast cancer to other therapies including hormonal therapies, topoisomerase inhibitors, and anthracyclines. This review includes an analysis of 80 published studies encompassing more than 25,000 patients designed to consider the relative advantages and disadvantages of the various methods of measuring HER-2/neu in clinical breast cancer specimens. Southern blotting, PCR amplification detection, and fluorescence in situ hybridization assays designed to detect HER-2/neu gene amplification are compared with HER-2/neu protein overexpression assays performed by immunohistochemical techniques applied to frozen and paraffin-embedded tissues and enzyme immunoassays performed on tumor cytosols. The significance of HER-2/neu overexpression in ductal carcinoma in situ and the HER-2/neu status in uncommon female breast conditions and male breast cancer are also considered. The role of HER-2/neu testing for the prediction of response to trastuzumab therapy in breast cancer is reviewed along with the current studies designed to test whether HER-2/neu status can predict the response to standard and newer hormonal therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and radiation. The review will also evaluate the status of serum-based testing for circulating HER-2/neu receptor protein and its ability to predict disease outcome and therapy response.","title":"Targeted therapy in breast cancer: the HER-2/neu gene and protein.","pubmedId":"14762215"}
