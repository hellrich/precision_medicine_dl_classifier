We reviewed overall scenario of lung cancer and surgical results in Nepal.\n1000 patients with the pathological diagnosis of lung cancer were analyzed to summarize the overall scenario of lung cancer. 157 NSCLC patients underwent pulmonary resection. cIA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA (N1) underwent surgery as initial modality of treatment. cIIIA (N2) patients were taken for surgery after neoadjuvant chemo/ chemoradiation.\nAnalysis of 1000 patients showed squamous cell carcinoma in 41.3%, incurable stage (IIIB/ IV) in 66.8% and rate of curative resection in 6.7% cases. Surgery as a single modality of treatment was used in 38%. Neoadjuvant Chemo/ chemoradiation/ radiation followed by surgery and surgery followed by chemo/ chemoradiation/ radiation was done in 12% and 50%, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 2% (post pneumonectomy: 5.5%; post lobectomy: 1.5%; post sublobar resection: 0%). R0 resction was achieved in 91% cases. Median survival and 5-year overall survival were 36 months and 18%, respectively. Better survival was achieved in pI-II vs pIII/ IV, pN0-1 vs pN2 and pR0 vs pR+ (p \u003c0.05).\nEarlier stage (pI-II), R0 resection and pathological pNo-1 has the best five year overall survival in Nepalese patients with NSCLC as well.","title":"Surgical Results of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in Nepal.","pubmedId":"26982898"}
