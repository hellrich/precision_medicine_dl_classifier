The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of S-1 monotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy.\nWe retrospectively analyzed 39 consecutive patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who received S-1 monotherapy after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy at the Shizuoka Cancer Center between August 2003 and October 2010. S-1 was given orally twice daily (80 mg/m(2)/day) for 28 days followed by a 14-day rest.\nThe median follow-up period in survivors was 31.5 months. Among 38 patients with measurable lesions, 9 (24%) showed partial response and 15 (39%) showed stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 4.9 months and the median overall survival was 13.2 months. The median progression-free survival for oropharyngeal cancer (n\u003d 7) was significantly longer than for other cancers (n \u003d 32) (14.9 vs. 4.7 months, P\u003d 0.035). The response rate in patients with a recurrence-free interval since the last platinum administration \u003e6.0 months was significantly better than with a recurrence-free interval \u003c6.0 months (40 vs. 13%, P\u003d 0.0102). Recurrence-free interval \u003e6.0 months also showed a significantly better progression-free survival (6.0 vs. 2.6 months, P\u003d 0.045). The frequency of Grade 3/4 toxicities was less than 10%.\nS-1 monotherapy shows promising signs of efficacy and tolerability in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy in this retrospective cohort and warrants further investigation in this population.","title":"S-1 monotherapy for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after progression on platinum-based chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"21980053"}
