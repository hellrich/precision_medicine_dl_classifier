The TSG6 cells had well preserved the features of signet-ring cell carcinoma based on morphology. The cells exhibited both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) immunoreactivities, and also secreted EGF. Moreover, the growth of TSG6 cells was stimulated in the presence of exogenous EGF. These results suggest that the possible presence of an EGF/EGFR autocrine growth mechanism is expressed in the TSG6 cells. The simultaneous treatment with EGF and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) produced a nearly 2.4-fold enhancement of 5-FU cytotoxicity against TSG6 cells. A bromodeoxyuridine/DNA flow cytometry analysis revealed that EGF augmented 5-FU cytotoxicity by inducing the accumulation of S phase cells which might be more susceptible to 5-FU. Moreover, we found that the incorporation of 5-FU into the TSG6 cells was increased with the addition of EGF. These data indicate that EGF may be a potent agent as a biological response modifier for 5-FU against the tumors which express the EGF/EGFR autocrine mechanism, and that the TSG6 cell line is useful in furthering our understanding of the interaction between anticancer drugs and EGF.","title":"Augmentation of 5-fluorouracil cytotoxicity by epidermal growth factor in a newly established human signet-ring cell carcinoma of the stomach in culture.","pubmedId":"8054813"}
