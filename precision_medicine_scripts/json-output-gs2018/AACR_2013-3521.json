High expression of B7-H3 has been related to a poor prognosis in some tumor types. Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. B7-H3 expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR and IHC analysis on individual melanoma specimens and then verified in clinically annotated melanoma stage III and stage IV metastasis tissue microarrays(TMA) in a double blind study. B7-H3 mRNA expression was shown to be significantly increased with stage of melanoma(P\u003c0.0001) and significantly associated with melanoma-specific survival(MSS) in both stage III(P\u003c0.0001) and stage IV(P\u003c0.012) melanoma patients. B7-H3 expression was related to migration and invasion of melanoma cells; overexpression B7-H3 increased migration and invasion while knockdown of B7-H3 reduced cell migration and invasion. MiR-29c expression was shown to inversely regulate B7-H3. Furthermore, we demonstrated that B7-H3 expression was related to p-STAT3 expression in melanoma. These results suggest B7-H3 may be a useful biomarker for melanoma progression and patients outcome.","title":"B7-H3 associated with tumor progression and epigenetic regulatory activity in cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-3521"}
