Molecular markers including Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) were evaluated on CTCs by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and compared to patients\u0027 primary and metastatic cancer.\nThe median cell count from patients with breast cancer using the CPK was 117 vs 4 for CEK (P\u003c0.0001). Lung cancer samples were similar; CPK: 145 cells vs CEK:4 cells (P\u003c0.0001). Recovered CTCs were relatively pure (60-70%) and were evaluable by FISH and immunofluorescence. A total of 10 of 30 (33%) breast cancer patients with HER2-negative primary and metastatic tissue had HER2-amplified CTCs.\nThe CPK method provides a high yield of relatively pure CTCs, facilitating their molecular characterisation. Circulating tumour cells obtained using CPK technology demonstrate that significant discordance exists between HER2 amplification of a patient\u0027s CTCs and that of the primary and metastatic tumour.","title":"Improving the yield of circulating tumour cells facilitates molecular characterisation and recognition of discordant HER2 amplification in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"20461092"}
