Currently, TNM staging is the most widely used prognostic factor.  The classification of different histological subtypes of BC may further improve the survival estimation and help guiding on the selection of the best therapeutic approach. Due to the lack of epidemiological data in Brazil, we have carried out this study. Methods:  The main objective of this study was to evaluate the 3 year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates women with BC treated with curative intent. Subgroups according to IHC findings were defined as follow: hormone+/erbB2-, hormone+/erbB2+, hormone-/erbB2+, and hormone-/erbB2-. Prognostic correlation with TNM staging using standard univariate analysis was performed. Review of 253 medical records of patients treated during the period from 01/01/2001 to 31/05/2006 at the Department of Mastology (in USFC, UNIVALI, Clinica de Neoplasias Litoral and UNACON) was undertaken. Adjuvant treatment was administered as per ASCO guidelines. Results:  The 3-year DFS rates for hormone+/erbB2- (136pts), hormone+/erbB2+ (48pts), hormone-/erbB2+(17pts), and hormone-/erbB2- (52pts) were: 86.03%, 72.92%, 76.47% and 65.38%, respectively (p\u003d0,01). Similarly, the 3-year OS rates were 93.40%, 95.84%, 88.24% and 84.62%, respectively (p\u003d0,01). By comparing the DFS according to IHC subtypes with the DFS according to TNM staging, our data demonstrates that 136 patients with hormone+/erbB2- tumors have a better prognosis regardless of their clinical stage (stage I 29pts ; stage II 78 pts; stage III 28 pts). Out of these, 71 pts (52%) received adjuvant radiotherapy, 72 patients (53%) chemotherapy and 121 pts (90%) hormonal therapy. There was no significant association with DFS for histological grade or clinical stage in this larger subgroup. Conclusions:  This study containing limited epidemiological data of BC patients from Southern Brazil suggests that IHC is a prognostic factor at least as important as the TNM staging regarding DFS. The short follow-up time made inappropriate any conclusions for OS.","title":"Prognosis of patients with breast cancer (BC) in southern Brazil based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and TNM staging.","pubmedId":"ASCO_82088-102"}
