Simultaneous statistical analysis of data obtained with the four methods (31 samples) showed that Western blot detected a higher percentage of alterations than the other assays (Cochran and Victor tests, 0.01 less than p less than 0.05). The same result was emphasized by pair analysis (McNemar, p less than 0.05), which evaluated the assay data two by two. Immunohistochemical evaluations were more in accord with immunoprecipitation data when performed on frozen or Bouin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues than on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.","title":"Different assays for HER-2/neu evaluation in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"1355935"}
