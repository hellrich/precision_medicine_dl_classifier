However, the predominant location of these lesions in the small bowel makes them difficult to diagnose. We report the successful use of balloon enteroscopy in conjunction with conventional methods for clinical diagnosis of jejunal GISTs in a 70-year-old man with NF1 who presented with melaena. The importance of screening NF1 patients for GISTs and the complementary role of balloon enteroscopy with capsule endoscopy in such diagnoses is discussed.","title":"Use of balloon enteroscopy in preoperative diagnosis of neurofibromatosis-associated gastrointestinal stromal tumours of the small bowel: a case report.","pubmedId":"21712945"}
