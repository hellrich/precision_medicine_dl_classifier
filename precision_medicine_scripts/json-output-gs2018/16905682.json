All four features in each group, except pancreatic cancer in Australia (p \u003d 0.38), individually showed significant associations with CDKN2A mutations, but the effects varied widely across continents. Multivariate examination also showed different predictors of mutation risk across continents. In Australian families, \u003e or \u003d2 patients with MPM, median age at melanoma diagnosis \u003c or \u003d40 years and \u003e or \u003d6 patients with melanoma in a family jointly predicted the mutation risk. In European families, all four factors concurrently predicted the risk, but with less stringent criteria than in Australia. In North American families, only \u003e or \u003d1 patient with MPM and age at diagnosis \u003c or \u003d40 years simultaneously predicted the mutation risk.\nThe variation in CDKN2A mutations for the four features across continents is consistent with the lower melanoma incidence rates in Europe and higher rates of sporadic melanoma in Australia. The lack of a pancreatic cancer-CDKN2A mutation relationship in Australia probably reflects the divergent spectrum of mutations in families from Australia versus those from North America and Europe. GenoMEL is exploring candidate host, genetic and/or environmental risk factors to better understand the variation observed.","title":"Features associated with germline CDKN2A mutations: a GenoMEL study of melanoma-prone families from three continents.","pubmedId":"16905682"}
