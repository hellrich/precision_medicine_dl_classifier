Recent immunohistological studies suggested that dysregulation of cyclin A, cyclin D, cyclin E, p16(ink4), p21(waf1/cip1), and p27(kip1) are of prognostic value in patients with breast cancer. Our study represents the first comprehensive immunohistochemical cell cycle marker analysis for cdc25A, cyclin A, cyclin D, cyclin E, p16(ink4), p21(waf1/cip1), p27(kip1), and pRb in tumor tissue and adjacent benign breast tissue from 69 primarily untreated breast cancer patients.\nImmunhistochemistry using primary monoclonal antibodies to detect cdc 25A, cyclin A, cyclin D, cyclin E, p16(ink4), p21(waf1/cip1), p27(kip1), and pRb has been performed.\nSixty-nine patients with untreated, invasive breast cancer (n \u003d 69) were divided into a low/ intermediate and a high risk group according to the St. Gallen 2005 consensus conference. High risk patients (n \u003d 22) had a significantly (p \u003d 0.003) shorter mean and median survival (282.85 weeks; 383.0 weeks, respectively) than low/intermediate risk patients (375.41 weeks; not reached yet, respectively). A subgroup of high risk breast cancer patients characterized in addition by overexpression of cdc25A, cyclin A, cyclin E, p16(ink4a), and p27(kip1) experienced a shortened mean survival of 222.03, 235.71, 257.25, 239.18, and 261.94 weeks, respectively. Regarding benign breast tissue adjacent to breast cancer tissue, 59.4% of the patients investigated overexpressed cdc25A, 23.2% overexpressed pRb, and 63.2% exerted dysregulation of p27(kip1) while they proved to be negative for immunohistochemical staining regarding all other markers tested.\nThe immunohistological analyses of cdc25A, cyclin A, cyclin E, p16(ink4a), and p27(kip1) have the potential for further refining the risk assessment in patients with untreated breast cancer who belong to the high risk category defined according to the St. Gallen 2005 consensus conference. These cell cycle markers define a subgroup of high risk patients with even higher risk of metastazation and shortened survival. For confirmation a prospective study using standardized laboratory procedures in a larger population is needed.","title":"Cell cycle dysregulation influences survival in high risk breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"18665474"}
