AgNOR number was studied in 200 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, the count increased with increasing grade and the size became smaller and irregular with increasing grade of carcinoma. This study seems to suggest that this method has utility in grading of squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck.","title":"AgNORs in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck.","pubmedId":"12418633"}
