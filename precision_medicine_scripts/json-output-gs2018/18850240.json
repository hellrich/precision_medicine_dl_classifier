An anterior urethral meatotomy was made and a calcified but intact screw was removed from the urethra.\nScrew migration with urological manifestations are extremely rare and usually include bladder migration with a subsequent voiding of the screw. We present a case in which internal urethrotomy for posterior urethral stricture caused erosion of a bone screw into the urethra which was subsequently removed by anterior meatotomy.","title":"Urethral erosion of a bone screw after internal urethrotomy: a rare complication after pelvic trauma.","pubmedId":"18850240"}
