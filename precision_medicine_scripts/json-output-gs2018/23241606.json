Due to the low quantity and increased fragmentation of cffDNA, the choice of DNA extraction method is a crucial step for downstream analyses.\nIn our study, the three spin column-based kits for isolation of cffDNA [DNA Blood Mini Kit (DBM), DSP Virus Kit (DSP) and Circulating Nucleic Acid (CNA) Kit] were compared. Original and optimized protocol were used in comparison and applied in the two phases of the study.\nA statistically significant difference in performance of the kits was determined based on the comparison of genomic equivalents per mL (GEq/mL) values (p\u003c0.0001). The GEq/mL of isolated DNA was significantly higher using CNA and DSP Kits than DBM Kit. The CNA Kit and DSP Kit did not significantly differ in the GEq/mL values, although all tested samples isolated with CNA Kit showed higher values.\nAccording to our results the commonly used DBM Kit could be successfully replaced with CNA or DSP Kits. The replacement could be beneficial in qualitative as well quantitative tests (e.g., gender determination, aneuploidy detection) when the isolation yield limits subsequent analyses. However, there is an important decision to be made when switching DBM Kit for DSP or CNA Kits. The price of DBM Kit is two and six times lower than DSP and CNA Kits, respectively.","title":"Selection of the optimal manual method of cell free fetal DNA isolation from maternal plasma.","pubmedId":"23241606"}
