Several diagnostic methods have been proposed using flow cytometry to identify BCR/ABL1(+) B-ALL.\nWe evaluated expression of the myeloid antigen CD66c by flow cytometry in B-ALL. We studied 94 patients with B-ALL. The t(9;22)(q34;q11) or BCR/ABL1 rearrangement was detected by cytogenetic analysis or RT/PCR. Myeloid antigens CD66c, CD13, CD33, CD117, Myeloperoxidase, CD15 and CD65 were determined by flow cytometry.\nOf these 94 cases, 17 (18%) cases displayed BCR/ABL1 gene rearrangements and 38 (40%) cases were CD66c positive. CD66c was the most common myeloid antigen expressed on malignant lymphoblasts. Its expression was correlated with BCR/ABL1 rearrangements (P \u003d 0.0001): sensitivity 82%, specificity 69%, positive predictive value 37% and negative predictive value 95%. Co-expression of CD66c(+) CD13(+) was more frequent in BCR/ABL1(+) B-ALL (29%) than BCR/ABL1(-) cases (4%) (P \u003d 0.0044). Some BCR/ABL1(-) B-ALL cases (including hyperdiploid or cases with normal karyotype) were CD66c positive (31%).\nCD66c expression is correlated, but not specifically, with BCR/ABL1 rearrangement. It would seem better to interpret the absence of CD66c expression with a lack of BCR/ABL1 rearrangement. This myeloid antigen could be interesting in the detection of minimal residual disease.","title":"CD66c expression in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia: strength and weakness.","pubmedId":"20666852"}
