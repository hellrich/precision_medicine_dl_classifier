PI3KCA (and BRAF) may also be predictive. A previous analysis restricted to KRAS exon 2 has not revealed any role for mutation status as a predictive marker for bevacizumab therapy. This analysis assessed the prognostic and predictive impact of extended RAS and PI3KCA gene mutation status in patients receiving C +/- B +/- M in the randomised phase III MAX study.  Methods:  DNA was macrodissected from archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue. Mutation status was determined using pyrosequencing and confirmed with Sanger sequencing (for equivocal RAS). Mutation status (Wild type/WT v Mutated/MT) was correlated with efficacy outcomes (RR, PFS \u0026 OS). Predictive analyses were undertaken using a test for interaction involving both C vs CB + CBM  Results:  Patient demographics and clinical outcomes were comparable between the tissue study population (n\u003d281/60%) and the intention to treat population (n\u003d471). MT in KRAS exons 2, 3, 4 and NRAS 2, 3, 4 as follows; 32.4%, 4.3%, 3.9%, 1.4%, 0.7% \u0026 0. There were five patients who had more than one RAS MT (four with KRAS exon 2\u00264, one KRAS exon 2\u00263). The total proportion with any RAS MT is 40.9%. PI3K MT rate was 7.5% exon 9, and 3.6% exon 20. All RAS gene mutation status (WT v MT) had no prognostic impact for PFS, HR 0.92 (0.72-1.17) or OS HR 0.97(0.73-1.27). Using the comparison of C v CB + CBM, RAS gene mutation status was not predictive of the effectiveness of B for PFS, HR 0.56 (0.37-0.84) for RAS MT and HR 0.69 (0.49-0.97) for RAS WT, p for interaction 0.51. RR with RAS MT was higher without Bev (C 50% v CB/CBM 37.3%), but RR improved with Bev in the WT group (C 27.3% v CB/CBM 42.3%), p for interaction 0.01. PI3KCA mutation was neither predictive for bevacizumab effect nor prognostic.  Conclusions:  An additional 12.6% of MAX study patients who were KRAS exon 2 WT had additional RAS mutations. Neither all RAS gene mutation status nor PI3KCA mutation status was prognostic for progression-free survival or overal survival, or predictive of bevacizumab outcome in patients with advanced CRC.
