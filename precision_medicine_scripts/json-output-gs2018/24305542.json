The type of BCR/ABL1 was major in both patients, and the chimeric gene was also detected in neutrophils from peripheral blood by the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique. Patient 1 was a 59-year-old Japanese woman, and patient 2 a 45-year-old Japanese man. They had both developed leukemia suddenly. Their leukemic blasts expressed B cell and myeloid cell antigens, but concomitantly in patient 1 (biphenotypic) and separately in patient 2 (biclonal). Percentages of BCR-ABL1-positive neutrophils were 98% and 89%, respectively. Both patients received an imatinib (600 mg/day)-combined Hyper-CVAD regimen as induction therapy, followed by treatment with dasatinib (140 mg/day). MEC therapy was also applied between these two treatments in patient 2. At present, patient 1 has obtained complete molecular remission quantitatively and qualitatively, and patient 2 only quantitatively. Considering their acute onsets with no prior history of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), they were both diagnosed as having acute leukemia with Ph1, but not blastic crisis of CML. In this tyrosine kinase inhibitor era, it has become more difficult to differentiate these two types of Ph1-positive leukemia development.
