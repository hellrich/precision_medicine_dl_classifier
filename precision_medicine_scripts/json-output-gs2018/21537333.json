To clarify whether FLT3-ITD load as expressed as FLT3-ITD/wt ratio is also relevant in patients with NPM1 mutated AML, we assessed the FLT3-ITD mutation status and FLT3-ITD/wt ratio by fragment analysis in 638 NPM1mut AML (339 females; 299 males; 17.8-88.0 years), and analyzed its prognostic relevance in 355 patients. FLT3-ITD of various length and load were detected in 243/638 cases (38.1%). Median EFS (19.3 vs 9.7 months, P\u003c0.001) and median 2-year survival rate (72.0 vs 52.7%, P\u003d0.006) was better in FLT3wt (n\u003d212 with available follow-up data) than FLT3-ITD (n\u003d143). A higher FLT3-ITD/wt ratio as continuous variable was correlated with a shorter EFS (P\u003d0.028). When patients were separated into subgroups according to the FLT3-ITD mutation load, only a FLT3-ITD/wt ratio î‹¶0.5 conferred an independent adverse impact on EFS and OS, and retained its prognostic significance also in multivariate analysis (P\u003d0.009 for EFS, P\u003d0.008 for OS). In conclusion, for risk estimation in NPM1 mutated AML not only the FLT3-ITD status, but also the FLT3-ITD load has to be taken into account. These data might contribute to clinical decision making in AML.","title":"Prognostic impact of FLT3-ITD load in NPM1 mutated acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"21537333"}
