Hdm2 protein levels are auto-regulated by the self-ubiquitination activity of Hdm2 and on the transcriptional level by p53-activated transcription of the hdm2 gene. Little is known about the regulation of Hdmx expression levels, apart from the observation that the Mdmx protein can be cleaved by caspase-3 in a p53-inducible manner. In the functional analysis of two mutant Hdmx proteins, products of two alternatively spliced mRNAs, it was found that Hdmx proteins are targets for ubiquitination by Mdm2. The stability of the Hdmx protein is partly dependent on the presence of its internal acidic domain. Mdm2 appears only to require an intact RING domain to be able to ubiquitinate Hdmx and target it for proteasomal degradation. These findings highlight the intricate functional relationships between p53, Mdm2, and Hdmx.","title":"Hdmx protein stability is regulated by the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2.","pubmedId":"12874296"}
