Although the incidence is rare, most tend to occur in women. Several authors have described a distinctive histologic variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, the cribriform-morular variant, which is associated with FAP but also may be encountered in patients with non-FAP. This diagnosis may precede the symptoms of colorectal polyposis.\nA healthy 36-year-old woman was seen with a left thyroid nodule, and a 34-year-old woman with FAP was seen with a right thyroid nodule; both masses were suspicious for papillary thyroid carcinoma. Both patients underwent total thyroidectomy.\nPathologic examination of both specimens revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma, cribriform-morular variant. The first patient subsequently underwent colonoscopy, which was negative for polyposis.\nPatients diagnosed with the cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid cancer should be screened for the presence of FAP.","title":"Clinical curiosity: cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16477606"}
