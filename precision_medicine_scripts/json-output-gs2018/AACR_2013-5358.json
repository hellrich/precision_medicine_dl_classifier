Here we show that the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 interacts with EZH2 and other components of PRC2 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) and human breast cancer cells. The BRCA1-binding region in EZH2 overlaps with the non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-binding domain, and BRCA1 expression inhibits the binding of EZH2 to the HOTAIR ncRNA. Decreased expression of BRCA1 causes EZH2 re-targeting genome wide and elevates H3K27me3 levels at PRC2 target loci in both mouse ES and human breast cancer cells. BRCA1 deficiency blocks ES cell differentiation and enhances breast cancer migration and invasion in an EZH2-dependent manner. These results reveal that BRCA1 is a key negative modulator of PRC2 and that loss of BRCA1 inhibits ES cell differentiation and enhances cancer aggressive phenotypes via augmented PRC2 function.","title":"BRCA1 is a negative modulator of the PRC2 complex.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-5358"}
