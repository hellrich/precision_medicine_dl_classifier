Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) arises from parafollicular cells and is reported to overexpress several mRNAs such as RET, calcitonin, and CEA. These markers are thought to be useful in determining a molecular-based diagnosis of MTC. We examined the expression levels of PGP9.5 mRNA in 80 thyroid tissues using real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT-PCR) and found that PGP9.5 mRNA was overexpressed in all 11 MTCs examined, both hereditary and sporadic, but not in other histological tumour types. Furthermore, by RT-PCR, PGP9.5 mRNA was detected only in aspirates from three medullary carcinomas, and not in aspirates from other tumour types. These results demonstrate that, in addition to the expression of RET, calcitonin and CEA, PGP9.5 mRNA expression may contribute to the molecular-based diagnosis of MTCs.","title":"PGP9.5 mRNA could contribute to the molecular-based diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"14962731"}
