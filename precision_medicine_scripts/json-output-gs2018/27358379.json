Outcome was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank tests and Cox models.\nIn 664 tumors, no mutation was detected, 462 tumors were diagnosed with KRAS-, 39 patients with NRAS- and 74 patients with BRAF-mutation. Mutations in KRAS were associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [multivariate hazard ratio (HR) for PFS: 1.20 (1.02-1.42), P \u003d 0.03; multivariate HR for OS: 1.41 (1.17-1.70), P \u003c 0.001]. BRAF mutation was also associated with inferior PFS [multivariate HR: 2.19 (1.59-3.02), P \u003c 0.001] and OS [multivariate HR: 2.99 (2.10-4.25), P \u003c 0.001]. Among specific KRAS mutation variants, the KRAS G12C-variant (n \u003d 28) correlated with inferior OS compared with unmutated tumors [multivariate HR 2.26 (1.25-4.1), P \u003d 0.001]. A similar trend for OS was seen in the KRAS G13D-variant [n \u003d 71, multivariate HR 1.46 (0.96-2.22), P \u003d 0.10]. More frequent KRAS exon 2 variants like G12D [n \u003d 152, multivariate HR 1.17 (0.86-1.6), P \u003d 0.81] and G12V [n \u003d 92, multivariate HR 1.27 (0.87-1.86), P \u003d 0.57] did not have significant impact on OS.\nMutations in KRAS and BRAF were associated with inferior PFS and OS of mCRC patients compared with patients with non-mutated tumors. KRAS exon 2 mutation variants were associated with heterogeneous outcome compared with unmutated tumors with KRAS G12C and G13D (trend) being associated with rather poor survival.","title":"Outcome according to KRAS-, NRAS- and BRAF-mutation as well as KRAS mutation variants: pooled analysis of five randomized trials in metastatic colorectal cancer by the AIO colorectal cancer study group.","pubmedId":"27358379"}
