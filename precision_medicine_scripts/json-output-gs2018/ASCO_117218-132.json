However mGC and mCC/mRC differ in oncogene profiles. No study has evaluated the oncogene profile of mSBA on the continuum of mGC and mCC/mRC. This may give insight into biology and have implications for treatment.  Methods:  Respective analysis was performed on GI cancer patients who underwent tumor mutational profiling since 2010. Genotyping was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue using a multiplexed mutational profiling platform. Here we report results for APC, BRAF, EGFR, IDH1, KRAS, NRAS, PI3K, PTEN, and TP53.  Results:  We identified 12 patients with mSBA (11/12 with clinical data, 11/12 with genotype data). Median age at stage IV diagnosis was 61.1y (49.3-71.5y). Four patients had duodenal, 3 jejeunal, 2 ileal, and 2 multiple/unknown primary sites. All patients received 5FU and ox, while 8/11 received irino, 5/11 bev, 3/11 cetux, 1/11 regorafenib and 1/11 capecitabine. Two patients had adjuvant RT (both duodenal) while 4/11 received palliative RT. Survival was calculated from the date of stage IV diagnosis until death, with data censored on 2/1/2013. Median survival was 24.0 months (95% CI 6.4  60.0 mo). We compared genotype frequencies of mSBA patients (11) with mGC (41), mCC (161), and mRC (64) using Fishers exact test for pairwise comparisons. Conclusions:  While the small bowel sample size was small, a significant difference in KRAS mutation frequency was found when compared to gastric cancer. No significant differences in mutation frequencies were found when compared with colon or rectal cancer.SiteSmall bowelGastricColonRectalGeneRateRate (with p-value vs small bowel if difference exists)APC0/110/41 ---13/161 (0.607)5/64 (0.595)BRAF1/110/41 (0.212)21/161 (1.000)2/64 (0.383)EGFR0/111/41 (1.000)0/161 ---0/64 ---IDH11/110/41 (0.212)1/161 (0.124)0/64 (0.147)KRAS6/115/41 (0.006)61/161 (0.342)22/64 (0.311)NRAS0/110/41 ---1/161 (1.000)8/64 (0.351)PIK3CA1/115/41 (1.000)20/161 (1.000)8/64 (1.000)PTEN0/110/41 ---0/161 ---1/64 (1.000)TP532/114/41 (0.595)28/161 (1.000)19/64 (0.501)","title":"DNA mutation frequencies in metastatic small bowel adenocarcinoma (mSBA) in comparison to gastric (mGC), colon (mCC), and rectal cancer (mRC): Continuum or cutpoint?","pubmedId":"ASCO_117218-132"}
