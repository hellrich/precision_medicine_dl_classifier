About 20% of all breast cancer patients harbored HER2 amplification and could benefit from anti-HER2 therapy. In this study, we set out to determine the frequency of potentially actionable genomic alterations via broad, hybrid capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) in HER2 negative breast cancer tissues. Methods: 47 cases of HER2 negative combined with 14 cases of HER2 positive breast cancers previously determined by FISH testing were enrolled and all the patients signed the informed consent before assay. 7708 exons of 508 tumor related genes and 78 introns of 19 frequently rearranged genes were assessed for base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. The average median sequencing depth was about 400. Results: 19 of 47 HER2 negative breast cancers harbored at least one genomic alteration linked to potential treatment options. The most common actionable alterations were in PIK3CA (n \u003d 7, mTOR inhibitors), BRCA1/2 (n \u003d 6, PARP inhibitors), EGFR (n \u003d 4, EGFR TKIs), PTEN (n \u003d 3, mTOR inhibitors), FGFR1/2/3 (n \u003d 3, FGFR inhibitors). Its also worth noting that only 12 of 14 (85.7%) HER2 positive breast cancers previously confirmed by FISH were identified with HER2 amplification via NGS and 1 (BRCA1) additional actionable alteration was found in these cases. Conclusions: Our results implied that 40.4% of HER2 negative breast cancers could be targeted with approved drugs or investigational agents in clinical trials. High throughput NGS testing could guide personalized therapy of breast cancer, especially suitable for those HER2 negative patients.","title":"Broad, hybrid capture-based next generation sequencing identified actionable genomic alterations in HER2-negative breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_164121-176"}
