Eleven oligodendrogliomas were examined for the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Twenty-three tumors, including ten astrocytomas, one ependymoma, two glioblastomas, one case of gliomatosis, and nine poorly differentiated gliomas were positive for GFAP. Two astrocytomas, eleven oligodendrogliomas, eight ependymomas, four choroid plexus papillomas, two medulloblastomas, one glioblastoma, nine poorly differentiated gliomas, six cases of gliomatosis, and three unclassified tumors were GFAP-negative. In six tumors (including four that were classified as astrocytoma) GFAP staining was equivocal. All oligodendrogliomas were MBP-negative but three expressed MAG. It was concluded that many canine gliomas are not only morphologically but also immunocytochemically similar to human gliomas, but that a larger proportion of canine neuroectodermal growths are undifferentiated tumors.","title":"Immunocytochemical studies in canine neuroectodermal brain tumors.","pubmedId":"2409734"}
