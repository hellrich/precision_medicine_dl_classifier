Although cMYC alterations have been reported in colon cancer cell lines, little other information exists in primary colon tumors. We sought to determine the frequency of cMYC amplification in primary colon cancer and its relationship to other well defined colon tumor alterations. Methods: An initial set of 392 tumors were evaluated. All samples were tested for the BRAF V600E mutation and all were classified as proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) based on both IHC and microsatellite analysis of tumor tissue. A second set of 522 tumors was selected to replicate associations identified in the first set of samples. Similar to the initial cohort, both the BRAF V600E and the mismatch repair status of the tumors were assessed. The second cohort, however, included tumors that were both pMMR and dMMR. In both sets of samples, fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to evaluate cMYC gene amplification. Results: In cohort 1, cMYC amplification was observed in 15 of the 362 (4%) pMMR tumors successfully analyzed (Table 1). cMYC amplification was detected in 10 of 323 (3%) tumors with normal BRAF status vs. 5 of 39 (13%) tumors with altered BRAF status (p\u003d0.015). In the second cohort, cMYC amplification was found in 20 of the 522 (4%) tumors. Only 1 of the 152 (\u003c1%) dMMR tumors had cMYC amplification vs. 19 of the 370 (5%) pMMR tumors (p\u003d0.012). Of the pMMR tumors, cMYC amplification was detected in 13 of 333 (4%) tumors with normal BRAF status vs. 6 of 37 (16%) tumors with altered BRAF status (p\u003d0.007), nearly identical to the first group. Conclusion: cMYC amplification in colon cancer is an infrequent event. However, when present, cMYC amplification occurs almost exclusively in tumors that are pMMR. Additionally, among pMMR tumors, cMYC amplification is associated with the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation.","title":"cMYC amplification in colon cancer: A novel association with BRAF V600E and proficient DNA mismatch repair","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1151"}
