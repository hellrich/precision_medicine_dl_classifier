In the last decade, two EGFR target agents have significantly contributed to the understanding of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gefitinib and erlotinib are first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors(EGFR-TKIs)that play a key role in activating EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Although these reversible, small, molecular target agents provide a significant response and survival benefit, all responders eventually acquire resistance. Although various mechanisms of resistance have been identified, nearly 3 0% of patients who acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs have an unknown mechanism of resistance. Approximately half the patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who develop acquired resistance to these molecular target agents have a secondary mutation T790M in the threonine gatekeeper residue that coexists with a primary EGFR activating mutation. The strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKIs is a major clinical concept. Afatinib is a second-generation EGFR-targeting agent and an irreversible pan-HER inhibitor. It may improve survival further and help in potentially overcoming resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. In patients harboring activating EGFR mutations, certain treatments could be suggested for subsequent therapy after failure of first-generation EGFR-TKIs. This review discusses novel therapeutic strategies for activating EGFR-mutated, advanced NSCLC after failure of first-generation EGFR-TKIs.","title":"[Treatment strategy for activating EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer after failure of first-generation EGFR-TKIs].","pubmedId":"24916999"}
