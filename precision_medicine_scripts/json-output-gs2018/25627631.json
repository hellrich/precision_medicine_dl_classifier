Patients may be recommended radiotherapy (RT) as a treatment modality.\nTo analyze the outcome of patients with early-stage SCC of the lip treated with definitive RT at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia, between 1980 and 2012.\nNinety-three patients with early-stage SCC of the lip underwent RT. All patients were clinically node negative based on examination and/or relevant investigations. Retrospective chart review was performed. Patients treated since 2000 had data collected and entered prospectively.\nThe most frequently involved site was the lower lip (93%). Fifty-six patients (60%) had T1N0 and 37 patients (40%) had T2N0 disease. Most patients were treated with superficial or orthovoltage RT, with the median RT dose delivered 55 Gy (range, 40 to 70 Gy). Local recurrence occurred in 5 patients (5%), whereas regional metastases developed in 5 patients (5%). One patient developed concurrent local and regional relapse. No patient developed distant metastases. The 5-year recurrence-free survival was 90%.\nThe findings confirm the efficacy of RT as an efficacious treatment option in early-stage lip SCC.","title":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the lip in Australian patients: definitive radiotherapy is an efficacious option to surgery in select patients.","pubmedId":"25627631"}
