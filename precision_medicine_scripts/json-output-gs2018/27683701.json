{"keywords":["Neurotropic","intramedullary spinal cord","melanoma","metastasis"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Neurotropic melanoma (NM) is a rare variant of cutaneous melanomas. Compared with conventional melanoma, NM is more locally aggressive with an increased tendency for local recurrence but less likely for nodal or distant metastases. The often amelanotic, benign appearance may lead to treatment issues such as late presentation, diagnostic delay, misdiagnosis, insufficient surgical margins, and recurrence with resulting poor outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of NM with contiguous spread to the spinal cord. We present a case report of a 73-year-old male with gradual decline in mobility over the period of few months. He deteriorated very rapidly whilst inpatient with progressive myelopathy, loss of sphincter function and dysphonia with dysphagia due to involvement of lower cranial nerves. The neurotropic nature of the disease and prevalence in the head and neck region results in perineural and neural invasion with resulting neuropathies. Patient underwent posterior cervical decompression and resection of the higher cervical intramedullary spinal cord NM lesion. He recovered well with improvement of his limb weakness as well as bulbar function. Wide local excision (WLE) with adjuvant radiotherapy where indicated remains the current practice for treatment, with chemotherapy predominately being reserved as a salvage treatment for patients with disseminated disease.
