Previous studies showed high concordance of KRAS mutation status in primary lesion and corresponding metastatic sites in CRC. However, the data were mostly from Caucasians. The aim of this study is to compare KRAS mutation and other molecules mutation status between primary tumor and corresponding metastatic lesion in Chinese patients with CRC. In this retrospective study, Chinese CRC patients with paired samples of primary tumor and metastatic site were detected for KRAS codon 12 and 13 with quantitative real-time PCR, or detected for OncoCarta™ panel of 19 genes with MassARRAY(®) technique, including KRAS, BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA et al. Forty-eight paired CRC samples were analyzed for KRAS codon 12 and 13 using quantitative real-time PCR. Ten paired samples were analyzed by 19 genes OncoCarta™ Panel with MassARRAY(®) technique. KRAS mutation was found in 15 (25.9 %) primary tumors and 18 (31.0 %) metastases. The discordance of KRAS was observed in 11 (19.0 %) patients. Alteration of mutation points in primary site with mutant KRAS was not observed. In the 10 patients with multiple gene detection, PIK3CA mutation showed concordant mutation status in primary tumor and metastatic site, whereas discordance in BRAF, NRAS and AKT1 was detected. A concordance rate of 81.0 % was detected in KRAS mutation between primary tumor and metastatic lesion in Chinese patients with CRC. Discordance of BRAF, NRAS and AKT1 mutation status in primary tumor and metastases was observed.
