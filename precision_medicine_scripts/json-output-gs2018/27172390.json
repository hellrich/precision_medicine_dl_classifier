Additionally, the histologic and immunohistochemical features of the primary skin tumor and brain metastasis were also assessed.\nA 62-year-old woman with cutaneous malignant melanoma metastatic to the right frontal lobe (BRAF V600E negative) was evaluated for blurred vision in the right eye. Neovascular glaucoma, iritis, and posterior synechiae with no view of the retina or vitreous were evident on examination. Vitreoretinal biopsy and enucleation specimen both showed widespread neoplastic involvement of the retina and residual vitreous strands after vitrectomy. Choroid, trabeculum, and other intraocular structures were devoid of tumor burden. Diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma metastatic to the retina and vitreous was confirmed, and the patient expired shortly thereafter.\nCutaneous malignant melanoma metastatic to the eye has a relatively greater preference for the retina and frequently presents with uveitis and glaucoma. Neovascular glaucoma in these cases may likely be attributable to unusually increased vascular endothelial growth factor production by the intraocular melanoma tumor cells.","title":"Features of Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma Metastatic to the Retina and Vitreous.","pubmedId":"27172390"}
