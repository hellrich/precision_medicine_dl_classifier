All patients received irradiation-based conditioning before HSCT and all developed extensive chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). HNSCC was diagnosed at a median interval of 10 years after HSCT, mainly in numerous sites within the oral cavity (11 patients). Lymph node involvement was diagnosed in 4 patients. The TNM classification was: T1 in 6 patients, T2 in 2 patients, T3 in 2 patients, and T4 in 3 patients. Treatment was comprised of surgery in 10 patients, with clear surgical margins reported in 7 (including cervical lymph node dissection in 6 patients). Surgery was performed in addition to other treatments in only 2 patients (radiotherapy or cryotherapy). For the remaining 3 patients, treatment consisted in radiotherapy (2 patients) or chemotherapy (1 patient). Disease progression while receiving therapy was observed in 5 patients and 5 other patients developed disease recurrence between 3.5 and 23.7 months after treatment. Death occurred in 11 patients. At the time of last follow-up, only 2 patients were alive without any disease between 9 and 23 months after diagnosis.\nHNSCC developing in FA patients after HSCT is associated with a very poor prognosis. A systematic surveillance of the oral cavity is essential to permit early surgery, which to the authors\u0027 knowledge remains the only curative treatment for a minority of patients. It is very important to attempt to prevent this cancer by reducing chronic GVHD and using conditioning without irradiation.","title":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in 13 patients with Fanconi anemia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","pubmedId":"18831513"}
