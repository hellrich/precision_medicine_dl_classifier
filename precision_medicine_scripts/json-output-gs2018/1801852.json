Careful follow up and re-evaluation of this patient enabled us to diagnose the syndrome. Moreover, inspection of her father and sister indicated that they were also affected. An updated review of reported cases indicates that facial cleft occurs in approximately 5% of NBCCS patients. Various aspects of the disease and general measures for its monitoring and treatment are briefly discussed.","title":"Increased head circumference and facial cleft as presenting signs of the nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome.","pubmedId":"1801852"}
