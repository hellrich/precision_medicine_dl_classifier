Other information was identified from package insert, Biologics License Application, abstracts, news releases, and ClinicalTrials.gov.\nIdentified English-language articles were reviewed. Selected studies included phase I through III.\nHigh-risk neuroblastoma is primarily a childhood cancer with 5-year survival rates of 40% to 50%. Treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma includes induction chemotherapy, surgery, myeloablative chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and radiation therapy. For patients achieving clinical remission, limited treatments exist for preventing relapse. Dinutuximab is a chimeric, human-murine, anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody approved in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), aldesleukin (interleukin-2 [IL-2]), and isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid [RA]) for maintenance treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who achieve at least a partial response to first-line multiagent, multimodality therapy. In phase III trials, dinutuximab increased 2-year event-free survival and overall survival when compared to standard treatment. Severe adverse effects of dinutuximab include pain, hypersensitivity reactions, capillary leak syndrome, and hypotension.\nDinutuximab is the first anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody approved in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2, and RA for maintenance treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who achieve at least a partial response to first-line multiagent, multimodality therapy. Ongoing research will determine if dinutuximab could be used earlier in treatment, in nonresponders to initial therapies, in combination with chemotherapy, or in other cancers.","title":"Dinutuximab: An Anti-GD2 Monoclonal Antibody for High-Risk Neuroblastoma.","pubmedId":"26917818"}
