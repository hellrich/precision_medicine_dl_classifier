The IDH mutation was detected by using directly sequencing method for PCR product. The results indicated that among 90 de novo AML patients, 4 patients (4.4%) showed the IDH1 gene mutation positive, and 7(7.8%) patients showed IDH2 gene mutation positive. None was found harboring both mutations, the overall rate of mutation positive of them was 12.2%. In the AML patients with IDH gene mutation positive, the rate of normal karyotype was 72.7%, which was significantly higher than that in abnormality karyotype. The CR rate in mutation positive patients was 72.7%, which seemed as if higher than that in mutation negative patients, but without statistical significance. The mutation disappeared when the patients gained CR, and reappeared in same loci after relapse occurred. It is concluded that the IDH gene point mutation appears in normal karyotype patients, especially in patients combined with NPM1 gene mutation. The IDH gene mutation may be an important target for therapy and evaluating clinical prognosis of patients with normal karyotype.","title":"[Isocitrate dehydrogenase gene mutations in acute myeloid leukemia].","pubmedId":"21867611"}
