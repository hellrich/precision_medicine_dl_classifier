However, the tissue availability and technical feasibility limits the genotyping of EGFR T790M mutation in the clinical setting. The current study is, therefore, designed to develop a blood-based approach to detect the EGFR T790M mutation in advanced NSCLC patients.\nThe detection of EGFR T790M mutation is based on the principle of mutant-enriched PCR. We assessed the basic performance efficiency of this method, and confirmed its clinical applicability. EGFR T790M mutation in the plasma samples obtained from 33 patients with gefitinib-resistant NSCLC was analyzed by the both mutant-enriched PCR and direct sequencing.\nThe sensitivity of this method for the detection of EGFR T790M mutation was as low as 0.1%. In the 33 subjects whose samples were analyzed, the mutant-enriched PCR indentified more EGFR T790M mutation than direct sequencing (36.4% vs. 6.1%, P\u003d0.005), and the EGFR T790M mutation was more frequent in patients with EGFR activating mutations than those without EGFR activating mutations (62.5% vs. 11.8%, P\u003d0.004). Patients with EGFR T790M mutation have a better prior efficacy of gefitinib compared to those without EGFR T790M mutation due to the occurrence of the EGFR activating mutations.\nThe blood-based mutant-enriched PCR is an ideal noninvasive monitoring system for detecting EGFR T790M mutation for clinical application.","title":"Highly sensitive and noninvasive detection of epidermal growth factor receptor T790M mutation in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23886554"}
