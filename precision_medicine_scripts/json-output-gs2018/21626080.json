Simultaneous MTC and PTC were consistently smaller than nonsimultaneous MTC (6 vs. 13 mm for hereditary MTC, P \u003d .16; 12 vs. 23 mm for sporadic MTC, P \u003d .009; and 11 vs. 20 mm for any MTC, P \u003d .008) and PTC (8 vs. 20 mm, P \u003c .001). Simultaneous MTC and PTC increased among MTC and PTC patients over time: from 0% to 4.3% (PTC), from 0% to 4.6% (hereditary MTC), from 0% to 8.1% (sporadic MTC), and from 0% to 7.0% (any MTC). For sporadic MTC, these rates virtually doubled every 5 years. Of 6 patients with simultaneous hereditary MTC and PTC, 5 revealed late-onset REarranged during Transfection (RET) mutations (1 L790F carrier; 2 V804L and 2 S891A carriers).\nGreater pathologic scrutiny, in addition to environmental changes, explains the surge of simultaneous MTC and PTC in Germany. More data are needed from additional geographic areas and populations to delineate individual contributions of these factors.","title":"Simultaneous medullary and papillary thyroid cancer: a novel entity?","pubmedId":"21626080"}
