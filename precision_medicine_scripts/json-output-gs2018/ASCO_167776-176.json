However, there is a large genetic variability not only of a tumor to another but also depending on the stage of the disease. In order to deepen our knowledge about this and for a purpose referred to therapeutic and prognosis we studied 118 MM tumors and 73 nevi by target next generation sequencing. Methods: After extraction, tumor DNA of 118 tumors (44 metastatic tumors, 46 SSM, 11 ALM, 5 nodular, 2 Dubreuilh and 3 spitzoid) and 73 nevi (50 benign nevi, 18 dysplastic nevi and 5 spitzoid nevi) were sequenced using a panel of 15 genes (ALK, BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, GNA11, GNAQ, KIT, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NRAS, RAC1, RAF1, SF3B1, TERT and TP53) on a new generation sequencer (PGM Ion Torrent) using chips 318 with a depth \u003e 51000x . The analysis of the variants was made by dedicated software (Ion Reporter, wAnnovar) and we selected only those which had a sufficient quality score. Results: The results of the sequencing showed the presence of very large number of mutations. In the begnin nevi, excepting BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K, present in 86%) there were no other mutations. At the opposite, the percentage of mutations in many other genes (ALK, KIT,CDKN2A,TP53...) in MM tumors range from 55% (Breslow \u003c 1mm) to 90% in metastatic tumors. More than 80% of mutations were transitions C \u003e T reflecting the UV-induced mutagenesis. Interestingly, in 33% of atypical and Spitz nevi, we also found at least one mutation in one of these genes (40% of these mutations were reported in Cosmic databases). Comparison of the proportion of somatic mutations between the different types of nevi, tumors with low thickness and metastatic tumors clearly showed an accumulation of somatic mutations during tumor development. Conclusions: This chip dedicated to MM is interesting: high sensitivity, allowing a better tumor classification and rapid identification of therapeutic targets. In addition, it could help for MM diagnosis in case of pigmented lesions with atypical component or uncertain diagnosis. In a second step, this panel of markers will be used to detect circulating tumor DNA in plasma of patients and to correlate their presence with melanoma prognosis.","title":"MELADIAG: A panel of DNA biomarkers dedicated to melanoma diagnosis.","pubmedId":"ASCO_167776-176"}
