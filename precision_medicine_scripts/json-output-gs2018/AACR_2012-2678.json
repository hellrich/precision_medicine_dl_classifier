We have previously developed a bacterial cancer therapy strategy using the genetically-engineered strain, Salmonella typhimurium A1-R, which is auxotrophic for arg and leu, which attenuates growth in normal tissue but allows high tumor virulence. S. typhimurium A1-R is effective against metastatic human prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancer cell lines as well as osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and glioma cell lines in clinically-relevant nude-mouse and syngeneic-mouse models. The current study evaluated TCM as combination treatment during bacterial therapy in metastatic mouse models of human cancer. TCM prevented hemorrhagic spots on the skin, liver, and spleen after bacterial infection. Fur discoloration and reduced activity was also observed in mice treated with S. typhimurium A1-R. These symptoms were ameliorated when bacterial treatment was combined with TCM. In a syngeneic lung cancer metastatic model in immunocompetent mice, the combination of TCM and S. typhimurium A1-R enabled S. typhimurium to be safely administered at a dose of 2105 CFU twice a week i.v. in immunocompotent mice with increased treatment efficacy compared to monotherapy with S. typhimurium A1-R. The results of the present study suggest that combination of S. typhimurium A1-R and TCM has important potential for cancer therapy.","title":"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in combination with S. typhimurium A1-R for cancer treatment","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2678"}
