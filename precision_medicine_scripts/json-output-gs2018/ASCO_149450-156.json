In two large phase III trials responses were observed in 10-15% of patients. However, 64% of patients exhibited significant and 20% of the patients severe grade 3 and 4 side effects. Identifying predictive biomarker profiles could enable better treatment allocation.  Methods:  In this multicenter study 176 tumor samples from 125 patients with metastatic melanoma were analyzed for PD-L1 gene expression, thereof 78 patients had received ipilimumab (30 responders and 48 non-responders). mRNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue by a fully automated method and measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Differences of survival and PD-L1 expression between patient groups were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the logrank test and the Kaplan-Meier technique.  Results:  Patients with low PD-L1 expression showed a significantly better survival than those with high expression of PD-L1 (p \u003d 0.002) not considering the subsequent therapy. No statistical difference in PD-L1 expression between responders (n \u003d 30) and non-responders (n \u003d 48; p \u003d 0.458) to ipilimumab was observed.   Conclusions:  Our results suggest that PD-L1 expression is not predictive for response to therapy with ipilimumab but is a positive prognostic marker for survival of melanoma patients.","title":"Association of PD-L1 expression in melanoma with response and prognosis to ipilimumab.","pubmedId":"ASCO_149450-156"}
