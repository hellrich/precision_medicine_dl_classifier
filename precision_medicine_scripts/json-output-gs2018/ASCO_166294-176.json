The tumor suppressor miR-34a down-regulates expression of \u003e30 oncogenes (eg, MET, MEK1, PDGFR-, CDK4/6, BCL2, WNT 1/3, NOTCH1, CD44), as well as genes involved in tumor immune evasion (eg, PD-L1, DGK). MRX34, a liposomal miR-34a mimic, is a potential first-in-class miRNA therapy for cancer. Methods: Pts with advanced solid tumors (N\u003d99) were enrolled in a standard 3+3 dose escalation trial of MRX34 infused IV on a biweekly (BIW) or daily x 5 (QDx5) schedule. The primary objective was MTD and recommended phase II dose (RP2D); secondary objectives were safety, PK, and biological and clinical activity. Results: Pts with HCC (42), RCC (2), acral melanoma (2), and other tumor types (53) were enrolled. Most were Caucasian (58%) and male (65%), with median age 60 y and 4 median prior therapies (range, 112). Most common AEs (% all/grade 3/4) were fever (64/2/0), chills (54/0/0), fatigue (49/4/0), back pain (44/8/0), nausea (40/2/0), vomiting (25/2/0), anorexia (25/2/0), and headache (25/0/0). Lab abnormalities (% grade 3/4) included lymphocytopenia (37/18), thrombocytopenia (22/2), elevated AST (21/3), neutropenia (19/9), and hyponatremia (18/3). Required steroid premedication reduced infusion-related AEs, and the QDx5 schedule improved safety and PK, with AUC increased ~10-fold on day 5 vs 1. The QDx5 MTD/RP2D was 70 mg/m2 for HCC and 93 mg/m2for non-HCC solid tumors. Analysis of RNA from WBCs showed dose-dependent repression of miR-34a target oncogenes, including FOXP1, BCL2, HDAC1, and CTNNB1. Three pts (HCC, RCC, acral melanoma) achieved prolonged confirmed PR per RECIST and 14 pts had SD (median duration, 136 days; range, 79386). Conclusions: MRX34 has a manageable toxicity profile and evidence of activity in HCC, RCC and melanoma. Enrollment into phase Ia expansion cohorts continues, and phase II studies are being planned.
