A single case of lentiginous melanocytic hyperplasia overlying a dermatofibroma has been reported, however, nevi and melanoma have to the best of our knowledge, not been previously reported. We present 14 cases of melanocytic lesions associated with dermatofibromas. The clinical data and hematoxylin- and eosin- stained sections were obtained and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was immunostained with antibodies against S-100, Mart-1, Factor XIIIa, and CD117. There were nine females and five males ranging in age from 30 to 64 years and anatomic sites included back (five), arm (six), flank (two), and leg (one). The clinical diagnosis ranged from dermatofibroma to desmoplastic melanoma. Histologically, the melanocytic lesions included junctional, compound, and dermal nevi, and malignant melanoma in situ. In four cases the dermal component appeared to merge with the dermatofibroma. In the case of the melanoma in situ, the dermatofibroma abutted the epidermis. Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic lesions were S-100/ Mart-1+, FXIIIa-, and the dermatofibromas were S-100/Mart-1-, FXIIIa+. Melanocytic neoplasia may appear in association with dermatofibromas. The fibrohistiocytic proliferation may be misinterpreted as a spindle or pleomorphic melanocytic process. Awareness of this association will aid in the correct diagnosis, and immunohistochemical studies will help in the differentiation of these two cell populations.","title":"Melanocytic lesions associated with dermatofibromas: a spectrum of lesions ranging from junctional nevus to malignant melanoma in situ.","pubmedId":"15803191"}
