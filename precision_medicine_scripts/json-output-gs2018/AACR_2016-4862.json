Natural antibodies to the alpha-Gal epitope are responsible for the hyperacute rejection of xenografts in humans. It is proposed that intratumorally administered AGI-134 will incorporate into the cell membranes of the tumor cells, presenting the alpha-Gal epitope for binding of anti-Gal antibodies to the tumor cells. This will initiate an immune response that attacks the injected tumor and, through uptake of immune-complexed tumor antigens by antigen presenting cells, will create a patient-specific, systemic anti-tumor response against distant metastases.Results: We demonstrate that AGI-134 incorporates into tumor cell membranes in vitro and that the exposed alpha-Gal epitope binds anti-Gal IgG and IgM antibodies from human serum to the tumor cell surface. Using flow cytometry and a complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay we show that tumor cell opsonization with anti-Gal antibodies leads to deposition of complement proteins C3b and C5b-9, which ultimately leads to tumor cell lysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AGI-134-labeled tumor cells opsonized with human serum proteins are phagocytosed by professional APCs.Using the B16-F10 melanoma model in anti-Gal producing 1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout (GT KO) mice we present data to demonstrate that AGI-134 injection into a primary tumor provides significant dose-dependent protection from the development of established distant lesions. Using GT KO mouse serum we demonstrate in vitro that deposition of complement on AGI-134-labeled mouse tumor cells is both alpha-Gal and anti-Gal dependent. In vivo, we demonstrate that the effect of AGI-134 is due to the alpha-Gal moiety by replacing it with human blood group antigens. The protection from secondary lesions conferred by AGI-134 is long lasting in the GT KO mouse melanoma model (monitored up to 90 days). Importantly, when sub-optimal concentrations of AGI-134 were tested in vivo in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody (RMP1-14), a significant enhancement in efficacy over either of the agents administered alone was observed.","title":"AGI-134: a fully synthetic alpha-Gal glycolipid that prevents the development of distal lesions and is synergistic with an anti-PD-1 antibody in a mouse melanoma model","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4862"}
