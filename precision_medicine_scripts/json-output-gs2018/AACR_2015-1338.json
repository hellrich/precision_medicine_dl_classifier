Epigenetic modifications are key players in regulating gene expression. Modulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has received attention for its implications in altering gene regulation. While HDAC pan-inhibition directly affects tumor growth, the immune system may be negatively impacted. Novel HDAC-selective inhibitors can ameliorate these undesirable effects. HDAC6 is unique in containing two catalytic domains, allowing for the development of isotype-selective inhibitors. Here a novel role of HDAC6 in T-cell immunity with important implications for adoptive cell therapy was explored. Initially a delay in B16 melanoma growth was observed in HDAC6KO mice (p\u003c0.001 at day 19). Furthermore, tumor-free HDAC6KO mice vaccinated with melanoma antigen peptides displayed a mean of 30% antigen-specific circulating CD8+ T-cells versus 12% in WT mice. Moreover, HDAC6 expression was reduced over three fold in T-cells activated in vitro. To further investigate the role(s) of HDAC6 in anti-tumor T-cell responses, the HDAC6 selective inhibitor rocilinostat was utilized. Adoptive transfer of rocilinostat-treated T-cells conferred an increased anti-melanoma response in a B16 model (day 25 mean tumor volume 800 vs. 2200 cubic mm), characterized by accumulation of central memory T-cells in the lymph nodes. To directly address the clinical potential of targeting HDAC6, T-cells from healthy human donors and melanoma patient-derived TILs were treated with rocilinostat. A modest but consistent 5% increase in central memory phenotype in healthy CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells was observed. While a decrease in the nave, effector and effector memory subsets occurred, no differences in cell viability were seen. Rocilinostat treatment of TILs derived from different cell preparations (e.g. tumor digest, pre- and post-rapid expansion in vitro) displayed up to a three-fold increase in central memory in three patients analyzed. Impressively, repeated in vitro treatment with rocilinostat further increased the proportion of central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Intriguingly, initial results show that the transcription factor T-BET, involved in T-cell function, was upregulated in TILs after rocilinostat treatment and in vitro expansion. Functionally, activation of rocilinosat-treated TILs resulted in increased IFNg+CD107a+ T-cells. Ultimately, rocilinostat pre-treatment of TILs or concomitantly with tumor resulted in 70% killing of HLA matched melanoma cells, compared to 50% killing by control-treated TILs, both relative to melanoma only control. These preliminary data provide a rationale for targeting HDAC6 in T-cells to improve cancer immunotherapy.","title":"Novel implications of histone deacetylase 6 selective inhibition in melanoma T-cell immunotherapy","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-1338"}
