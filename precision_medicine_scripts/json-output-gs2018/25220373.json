Following the androgen receptor (AR) pathway, it is the second major driver of PCa growth.\nTo assess efficacy of novel PI3K/AKT-targeted therapies in PCa models, as a single agent and in combination with androgen deprivation.\nTwelve human PCa cell lines were tested in vitro for sensitivity to the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 and the PI3K beta/delta inhibitor AZD8186. The combination of AZD5363 and AZD8186 with castration was evaluated in vivo in PTEN-negative versus PTEN-positive patient-derived xenografts. Tumors and plasma were collected for biomarker analysis.\nIn vitro growth inhibition was determined by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. In vivo efficacy was monitored by caliper measurements of subcutaneous tumor volume. PI3K/AKT and AR pathway activity was analyzed by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nAZD5363 and AZD8186 inhibited in vitro growth of 10 of 12 and 7 of 12 PCa cell lines, respectively, with increased sensitivity under androgen depletion. In vivo, AZD5363 and AZD8186 as single agents significantly inhibited growth of PTEN-negative PC346C xenografts compared to placebo by 60% and 66%, respectively. Importantly, combination of either agent with castration resulted in long-lasting tumor regression, which persisted after treatment cessation. Expression of AR-target genes kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3, also known as PSA); transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2); and FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) was upregulated after PI3K/AKT inhibition. Neither compound inhibited tumor growth in the PTEN-positive PC310 model.\nCombination with hormonal therapy improved efficacy of PI3K/AKT-targeted agents in PTEN-negative PCa models. Upregulation of AR-target genes upon PI3K/AKT inhibition suggests a compensatory crosstalk between the PI3K-AR pathways. These data strongly advocate for further clinical evaluation.\nInactivation of the PTEN gene is a common event promoting prostate cancer (PCa) progression. This preclinical study illustrates the potent anticancer activity of novel PTEN-targeted drugs on PCa models, particularly in combination with hormonal therapy.","title":"High Efficacy of Combination Therapy Using PI3K/AKT Inhibitors with Androgen Deprivation in Prostate Cancer Preclinical Models.","pubmedId":"25220373"}
