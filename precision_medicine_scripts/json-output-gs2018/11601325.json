In our study, we used two microsatellite markers on chromosome 9, one was locus D9S319 (9p21), and the other was D9S299 (9q22.2-22.3). After PCR was performed, the samples were electrophoresed through 5% denatured polyacrylamide gels which were dried and exposed to Fuji XR films.\nLoss of heterozygosity with D9S319 (9p21) marker was not observed in the 10 informative cases of sporadic basal cell carcinoma, 19 squamous cell carcinoma and 4 Bowen\u0027s disease. Allelic deletion of D9S299 was not seen in the 21 informative cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 4 Bowen\u0027s disease. D9S299 (9q22.2-22.3) allele loss occurred in 2 of the 10 informative cases of sporadic basal cell carcinoma, indicating that there might be a susceptible tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 9, and loss of this allele might play an important role in the development of basal cell carcinoma. Inactivation of Drosophila patch (PTCH) (MSSE gene ESS1) in BCC might be necessary, if not sufficient, for BCC carcinogenesis.\nChromosome 9q22.2-22.3 may contain a putative tumor suppressor gene, and the loss of this gene may play an important role in the development of sporadic basal cell carcinoma.","title":"Allele loss on chromosome 9q22.2-22.3 in sporadic basal cell carcinoma in Chinese.","pubmedId":"11601325"}
