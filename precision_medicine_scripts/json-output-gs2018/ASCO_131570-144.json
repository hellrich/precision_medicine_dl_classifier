Given the expansion of molecularly-targeted therapeutics, there is a huge opportunity to use genomic testing for patient selection in clinical trials. We sought to determine the frequency of alterations across tumor histologies in patients with advanced cancer using a deep sequencing approach to assess for mutations in hotspot regions of 46 cancer-related genes.    Methods:  We examined data from the first 500 patients with advanced cancer prospectively enrolled on an IRB-approved protocol through the Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Archival tumor DNA was tested for hotspot mutations in 46 genes (Ampli-Seq Cancer Panel) using an Ion Torrent PGM Sequencer (Life Technologies, CA) at the clinical molecular diagnostics laboratory. The data were analyzed using R Statistical Software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).   Results:  Patients with 38 tumor types were enrolled. Of 500 patients analyzed, 293 had at least one detectable mutation. The most commonly mutated genes were TP53 (38%),  KRAS (11%), and PIK3CA (10%).  Of tumor types tested (n  10), sarcoma (20%) and kidney (30%) had the fewest alterations, while pancreas (100%), colon (91%) and melanoma (87%) had the highest proportion. 46 patients had both primary tumors and metastases analyzed; of mutations seen in primaries or metastases, 91% were seen in both. Across all samples, there was a strong pattern of mutual exclusivity between TP53 mutations and PIK3CA mutations. Alterations in potentially actionable genes were detected in 291 (58%) patients. Both rare mutations in common tumor types and potentially actionable (directly/indirectly druggable) mutations in rare tumor types were identified.  Conclusions:   Implementation of multiplex testing in the CLIA environment facilitates genomic characterization across multiple tumor types to identify novel opportunities for genotype-driven trials. Matching patients to molecularly targeted therapies is underway.","title":"Clinical next-generation sequencing to identify actionable alterations in a phase I program.","pubmedId":"ASCO_131570-144"}
