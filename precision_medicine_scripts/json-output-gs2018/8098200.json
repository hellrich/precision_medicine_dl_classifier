There were 54 DNA diploid cases (38%), 81 DNA aneuploid cases (57%) and 8 DNA multiploid cases. Analysis of oncogene amplification revealed 22 cases of c-myc, 4 cases of L-myc, and 22 cases of c-erbB-2. In curatively resected cases, the 5-year survival rate was 65% in 31 DNA diploid cases, and 36% in 40 DNA aneuploid cases. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p \u003c 0.02). However, in non-curatively resected cases, the 5-year survival rate was 11% in 23 DNA diploid cases, and 33% in 49 DNA aneuploid cases. There were no statistically significant differences among these groups. The correlation between DNA content and amplification of oncogenes was as follows. In DNA diploid cases, there were 4 cases of c-myc, and 6 cases of c-erbB-2. In DNA aneuploid cases, there were 15 cases of c-myc, 4 cases of L-myc, and 15 cases of c-erbB-2. In DNA multiploid cases, there were 3 cases of c-myc, and 1 cases of c-erbB-2. Amplification of oncogenes was seen more frequently in DNA aneuploid and multiploid cases than in DNA diploid cases. In 71 curative resected cases, the 5-year survival rate for amplified cases of c-myc (10 cases) was 0%, and that of cases with no amplification was 61% (no statistically significant difference). The 5-year survival rate for amplified cases of c-erbB-2 (10 cases) was 40%, against 52% for cases with no amplification. DNA content analysis using flow cytometry was more convenient than analysis of amplification of oncogenes, and reflects the prognosis of resected lung cancer better than oncogenes. There was no relation between DNA content and gene amplification.","title":"[Correlation between DNA content and amplification of oncogenes (c-myc, L-myc, c-erbB-2) and correlation with prognosis in 143 cases of resected lung cancer].","pubmedId":"8098200"}
