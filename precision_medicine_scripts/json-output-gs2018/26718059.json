Derangements in similar cellular signaling pathways occur in ADPKD and renal malignancies, although an association of these disorders has not been established. Herein, we present a case of papillary RCC (pRCC) incidentally discovered in a patient with ADPKD following bilateral native nephrectomy during renal transplantation. Whole exome sequencing of the pRCC found a somatic missense mutation in MET proto-oncogene, p.Val1110Ile, not present in kidney cyst epithelium or non-cystic tissue. RNA sequencing demonstrated increased mRNA expression of MET and pathway-related genes, but no significant copy number variation of MET was detected. Genetic analysis of PKD genes from peripheral blood lymphocytes and renal cyst epithelium identified a constitutional PKD1 germline mutation, p.Trp1582Ser, predicted to be pathogenic. Unique somatic mutations in PKD1 were also detected in 80% of the renal cysts analyzed, but not in the pRCC. These results suggest that, in this patient, the pRCC utilized a signaling pathway involving MET that was distinct from the pathogenesis of ADPKD. This is the first report of PKD1 mutations and a somatic mutation of the MET oncogene in a pRCC in ADPKD.
