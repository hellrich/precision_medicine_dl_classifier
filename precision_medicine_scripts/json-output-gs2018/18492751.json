Mutations of Ras, PIK3Ca, PTEN, and BRAF genes and RET/PTC rearrangements were common, whereas mutations in PDK1, Akt1, Akt2, and RTK genes were uncommon in ATC. Overall, 46 of 48 ATC (95.8%) harbored at least one genetic alteration, and coexistence of two or more was seen in 37 of 48 ATC (77.1%). These genetic alterations were somewhat less common in FTC. Genetic alterations that could activate both the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways were found in 39 of 48 ATC (81.3%). RTK gene copy gains were preferentially associated with p-Akt, suggesting their dominant role in activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. The phosphorylation of Akt was far more common than p-ERK in FTC, and both were relatively common and often coexisted in ATC.\nGenetic alterations in the RTKs and PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways are extremely prevalent in ATC and FTC, providing a strong genetic basis for an extensive role of these signaling pathways and the development of therapies targeting these pathways for ATC and FTC, particularly the former.","title":"Highly prevalent genetic alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in anaplastic and follicular thyroid cancers.","pubmedId":"18492751"}
