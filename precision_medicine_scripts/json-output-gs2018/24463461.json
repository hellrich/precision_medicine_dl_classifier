Recently, highly recurrent telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)-promoter mutations were found in malignant melanomas, which may function as driver mutations of skin cancer. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that MUP and mucosal melanomas harbor different prevalences of TERT-promoter mutations. Thirty-nine patients with MUP and 53 patients with mucosal melanomas were retrieved. In total, 152 paraffin samples of 92 patients were analyzed, and in 38 patients, multiple samples were tested. Mutational analysis of the TERT-promoter, BRAF, NRAS, and KIT genes was carried out. In total, 92 patients were eligible for mutational analysis. TERT-promoter mutations were found in 33 patients (35.9%): chr5, 1,295,228 C\u003eT (18 patients); chr5, 1,295,250 C\u003eT (11 patients); chr5, 1,295,228-229 CC\u003eTT (three patients); chr5, 1,295,242-243 CC\u003eTT (one patient). The mutations were significantly more prevalent in MUP [26 (66.7%)] than in mucosal melanomas [seven patients (13.2%); P\u003c0.001]. In MUP, BRAF mutations were found in 46.2% of patients (18 patients) and NRAS mutations in 28.2% of patients (11 patients). In mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutations were found in 18.9% of patients (10), and BRAF and KIT mutations in 7.5% of patients (four patients), respectively. The prevalence of TERT-promoter mutations was associated with the patient\u0027s sex [23 (51.1%) men, 10 (21.3%) women; P\u003d0.004]. No significant correlation was found between TERT-mutation and patient survival. The TERT-promoter genotype of MUP points toward a cutaneous and not mucosal origin. The significant sex differences merit further attention in having putative therapeutic implications.
