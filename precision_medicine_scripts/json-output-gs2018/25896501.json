Thyroglobulin and thyrotropin were measured in each patient. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets were counted. Statistical analysis was used to correlate the NLR with demographic and histopathologic characteristics of the patients.\nAge correlated with NLR and lymphocyte number in patients with PTC and NG. In patients aged \u003e45 years, those with PTC had a higher NLR and a lower lymphocyte count than those with NG. Patients with PTC aged \u003c45 years had a higher leukocyte count and a lower NLR than those aged â‰¥45 years. Patients with clinical stage I/II PTC had a lower NLR and a higher lymphocyte count than patients with stage III/IV.\nYounger patients with PTC had a higher lymphocyte count but a lower NLR than older patients with PTC. The NLR and lymphocyte counts were associated with the clinical stage. Thus, a higher NLR and a lower lymphocyte count may be prognostic for stratifying patients with thyroidal goiters and are risk factors of PTC for older patients.","title":"The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Correlates with Age in Patients with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25896501"}
