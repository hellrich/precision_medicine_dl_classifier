PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an important component of several signal transduction pathways that acts as a positive regulator of RAS-mitogen activated protein kinase signaling. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is another autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hamartomas in multiple organs. The NF1 gene encodes a GAP-related protein, which acts as a negative regulator of the Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway. Clinical overlap between both syndromes, neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS) is well known. We studied a female patient with typical findings of NFNS and found two mutations: a novel PTPN11 transversion, 1909A --\u003e G, resulting in Gln510Arg, and an NF1 transversion, 2531A --\u003e G, resulting in Leu844Arg. She inherited the PTPN11 mutation from her father and had a de novo NF1 mutation. This is the first report of molecular concurrence of both disorders in the same patient.","title":"Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome: molecular evidence of the concurrence of both disorders in a patient.","pubmedId":"15948193"}
