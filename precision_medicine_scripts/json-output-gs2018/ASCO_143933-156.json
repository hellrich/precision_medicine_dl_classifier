San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, 2014, Abstract P5-19-13).  Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI, letrozole and anastrazole), approved in the first-line setting for postmenopausal women with HR+ MBC, are being evaluated in combination with abemaciclib for safety and tolerability in a phase Ib study (NCT02057133) and in the present study (NCT02246621) to assess clinical efficacy.  Methods:  MONARCH 3 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study of abemaciclib + NSAI vs placebo + NSAI in locoregionally recurrent (not amenable to curative treatment) breast cancer or MBC, with no prior systemic therapy in this disease setting.  Patients will be randomized 2:1, and stratified by nature of disease (visceral vs bone-only metastases vs other) and prior (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor vs other vs none).  Abemaciclib 150 mg or placebo will be given continuously PO every 12 hours until progression, along with anastrozole 1 mg or letrozole 2.5 mg once daily at the investigators discretion, and assessments will occur every 28 days.  Postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- disease, a disease-free interval \u003e 12 mos after completion of (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy, ECOG PS  1, adequate organ function, and measurable disease or nonmeasurable bone-only disease (RECIST v1.1) are eligible.  The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS); a key secondary endpoint is overall survival (OS).  The study has 80% power to detect an increase in PFS of approximately 40% (hazard ratio \u003d 0.714). Assuming a median PFS of 10 mos in the control arm, this corresponds to a 4-mo increase in the median PFS.  PFS and OS will be hierarchically tested to maintain an overall type I error rate of 2.5%.  Enrollment began November 2014; planned enrollment is 450 patients.
