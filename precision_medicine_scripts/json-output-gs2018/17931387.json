To allow better adaptation of the donor tooth, the buccal roots of the third molar were removed using a diamond bur and the canal entrances were filled. Recall examination 6 years after completion of root-canal treatment showed normal periodontal healing with absence of infection, ankylosis or progressive resorption. The transplantation of a third molar is seen as a promising method to replace a lost permanent tooth, and to restore aesthetics and function.\n*Autotransplantation is a viable option for the treatment of a missing tooth or for replacement of traumatized tooth when there is a donor tooth available. *Fully developed third molars are potentially reliable candidates in the absence of other suitable donor teeth.","title":"Autotransplantation of a maxillary third molar to replace a maxillary premolar with vertical root fracture.","pubmedId":"17931387"}
