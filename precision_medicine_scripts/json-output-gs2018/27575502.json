A good sensitivity has been obtained. MRD rates obtained by LNA-RQ-PCR were used to draw kinetics of the disease evolution during the follow-up.\nIDH1/2 Results were compared to NPM1 mutation and WT1 over expression and have showed coherent kinetic between MRD rates in 7/11 cases. For the rest, the direct sequencing and the high resolution melting (HRM) assay have confirmed the quantification Results in diagnosis but not in residual samples.\nSome optimization will be necessary to improve the mutated allele amplification. The LNA-RQ-PCR might be an easy and less cost method used in a small laboratory for myeloid leukemia MRD assessment using IDH1/2 mutations.","title":"Minimal Residual Disease assessment of IDH1/2 mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia by LNA-RQ-PCR.","pubmedId":"27575502"}
