The primary lesions were situated in the nose and paranasal sinuses in 3, middle ear in 2, epipharynx in 2, and parapharynx, esophagus, and neck in 1 patient. Histological examination indicated 3 rhabdomyosarcomas, 2 malignant lymphomas, and 1 each of neuroblastoma, malignant neuroendocrine tumor, transitional cell carcinoma, lymphepithelioma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The sites of origin and histopathology of malignant tumors in such patients usually differ from those in adults. Well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck is common in adults but not in children, in whom non-epithelial malignant tumors or sarcomas are not rare. Radiotherapy is more effective for treating malignant tumors of the head and neck in young than in adults. Eight of 10 patients are still alive, 7 of whom for 5 years or more. Two with rhabdomyosarcoma died.","title":"Malignant tumors of the head and neck in young patients.","pubmedId":"8216050"}
