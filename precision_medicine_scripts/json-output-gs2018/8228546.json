Although 90% of breast masses in men are malignant, delay in diagnosis often occurs with resultant advanced local or systemic disease common. The few clinical studies on male breast cancer suggest that the disease behaves similarly to female breast cancer. Management, therefore, should be similar to the management of female breast cancer. Stage I, II, and III disease require a multimodal approach with regional therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Most male breast cancers are estrogen or progesterone receptor positive and responses to hormonal therapy are high. A trial of hormonal therapy is warranted in most patients with stage IV disease.","title":"Male breast cancer.","pubmedId":"8228546"}
