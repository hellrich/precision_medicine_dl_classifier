{"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Gorlin syndrome (naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome) is a genetically linked disorder characterized by the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) throughout life. Cumulative surgery, cryotherapy and other conventional interventions can result in significant disfigurement by middle age. Radiotherapy is contra-indicated because the mutated gene underlying the syndrome, \u0027PTCH\u0027, increases sensitivity to ionising radiation, so there is significant likelihood of inducing further tumours in and around the irradiated area. Photodynamic therapy offers a non-invasive treatment option for patients with this condition, with the added advantage of causing minimal scarring.
