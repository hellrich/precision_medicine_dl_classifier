Additional work is needed to understand the mechanisms of resistance to rociletinib and other third generation EGFR TKIs. Methods: We employed circulating tumor DNA analysis using Cancer Personalized Profiling by deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq) to study putative mechanisms of innate and acquired resistance to rociletinib. CAPP-Seq was applied to a total of 115 serial plasma samples from T790M-positive NSCLC pts (n \u003d 43) enrolled in the TIGER-X (n \u003d 42) (NCT01526928) and TIGER-2 (n \u003d 1) (NCT02147990) clinical trials. Results: Rociletinib resistance was diverse, with mutations and/or copy number gains affecting 9 genes involved in bypass pathway activation and tumor suppressor pathways. Multiple resistance mechanisms were observed in 23% of pts. Examples of emergent alterations included activating KRAS mutations in three pts, a novel tertiary mutation in EGFR (L798I) in one patient, and an EGFRC797S mutation in one patient. Increased MET copy number was the most frequently observed mechanism of resistance, occurring in 26% of cases. Pts with heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms at baseline (both T790M and increased MET copy number) displayed inferior responses and significantly shorter progression free survival (P\u003c 0.05). In agreement with these clinical findings, erlotinib-resistant xenografts treated with rociletinib reproducibly developed MET amplification. Importantly, sensitivity to rociletinib could be reinstated by combined therapy with the METinhibitor crizotinib. Conclusions: We observed diverse and heterogeneous resistance mechanisms to rociletinib. The association of inferior outcomes with multiple resistance mechanisms at baseline emphasizes the clinical importance of tumor heterogeneity in these pts. Our results demonstrate that non-invasive profiling using ctDNA analysis can define patterns of resistance to targeted therapies and potentially allows for personalization of combination therapies to overcome resistance.","title":"Inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms to the mutant EGFR selective inhibitor rociletinib.","pubmedId":"ASCO_165226-176"}
