Therefore, 14 rakicidin A analogues were synthesized via a highly efficient combinatorial strategy and were evaluated against CML cell lines. The conjugated diene moiety was found to be crucial for the anti-CML activity of rakicidin A, and the changes in the configuration(s) at C-2, C-3, C-14, C-15, and C-16 resulted in lower levels of anti-CML activity. The most promising compound was 4-methylester rakicidin A (1a). Compared with rakicidin A, 1a exhibited 2.8-fold greater potency against the imatinib-resistant cell line K562/G(+) and approximately 100-fold enhanced potency compared with that of imatinib. Furthermore, compound 1a demonstrated a significantly lower resistance index against Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL(T315I) than bosutinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib, while 1a exhibited less effect on normal hematopoietic cells. Preliminary results indicated that 1a down-regulated caspase-3 and PARP, which contributes to its K562 cell inhibitory activity.
