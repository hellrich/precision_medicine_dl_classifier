BRAF mutation status in cfDNA from patient plasma collected at baseline, 732 of 836 (88%) enrolled patients in total, was determined.\nBRAF mutations were detectable in cfDNA in 76% and 81% of patients with BRAF V600E/V600K-positive tumors, respectively. Patients negative for BRAF mutations in cfDNA had longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival in each of the four studies, compared with patients with detectable cfDNA BRAF mutations. The presence of BRAF-mutant cfDNA was an independent prognostic factor for PFS after multivariate adjustment for baseline factors in three of four studies. Patients negative for BRAF mutation-positive cfDNA in plasma had higher response rates to dabrafenib and trametinib.\nBRAF mutations in cfDNA are detectable in \u003e75% of late-stage melanoma patients with BRAF mutation-positive tumors. The lack of circulating, BRAF mutation-positive cfDNA is clinically significant for metastatic melanoma patients, and may be a prognostic marker for better disease outcome.","title":"Correlation of BRAF Mutation Status in Circulating-Free DNA and Tumor and Association with Clinical Outcome across Four BRAFi and MEKi Clinical Trials.","pubmedId":"26446943"}
