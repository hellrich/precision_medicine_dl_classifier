The ovarian tumor was a primary pure large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Grossly, the left ovary was enlarged by a solid tumor that measured 9 x 7 x 7 cm. Histologically, the tumor consisted of large cells with irregular hyperchromatic nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. In some areas, the tumor cells were arranged in solid sheets; however, the predominant pattern was cribriform and solid-alveolar, with palisaded tumor cells located peripherally. The tumor cells showed multiple mitotic figures (up to 43 mitoses/10 HPF). Large areas of tumor necrosis were found. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for EMA, synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56, and CEA. Cytokeratin 20 was positive focally. Primary large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ovary is a rare tumor. To the best of our knowledge, only 4 cases of a pure tumor of this type have been reported to date.","title":"Primary pure large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ovary.","pubmedId":"18164557"}
