AG-120 is a first-in-class selective inhibitor of mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) under evaluation in an ongoing phase 1 study in patients with mIDH1 advanced solid tumors, including cholangiocarcinoma (CC) (NCT02073994). Objectives for this abstract were to 1) characterize the PK profile of AG-120 and the relationship between AG-120 exposure and 2-HG suppression, and 2) evaluate the influence of intrinsic patient factors on AG-120 clearance, in patients with mIDH1 CC. Methods: AG-120 was administered orally once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) in continuous 28-day cycles. As of Dec 5, 2016, 60 of 73 patients enrolled with mIDH1 CC had PK/PD samples available for analysis at 100 mg BID, 300 mg QD, 400 mg QD, 500 mg QD, 800 mg QD, and 1200 mg QD in dose escalation (n \u003d 24) and 500 mg QD (n \u003d 36) in dose expansion. Blood (n \u003d 60) and fresh tumor biopsy samples (n \u003d 14) were collected to assess AG-120 and 2-HG using qualified liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. Results: Following both single and multiple doses, AG-120 plasma exposure increased less than dose proportionally from 100 to 1200 mg. Mean terminal half-life was 38.485.8 h, supporting a QD dosing regimen. Following multiple doses, steady state was reached within 15 days, with approximately 2-fold accumulation in plasma AG-120 exposure. No patient-specific factors were identified as clinically significant covariates affecting AG-120 plasma clearance. After multiple doses, plasma 2-HG levels were reduced (up to 98.4% inhibition, achieving levels similar to those in healthy volunteers) and tumor biopsy 2-HG levels were also substantially reduced (by up to 99.9%) at all dose levels tested. The 500 mg QD dose resulted in the largest magnitude of 2-HG inhibition vs. other dose levels. Conclusions: AG-120 demonstrated a long half-life in patients with mIDH1 CC and robustly inhibited 2-HG in plasma and tumor samples. These PK/PD data, along with emerging safety and clinical activity data, support the selection of 500 mg QD for future clinical investigation.
