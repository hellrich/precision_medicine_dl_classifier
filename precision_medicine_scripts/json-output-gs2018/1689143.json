The percentage of lymphocytes recovered from the cancer varied widely; that of renal cell carcinoma was higher than that of breast or colon cancer (65% vs 45%), which was higher than that of melanomas or sarcomas (30% to 35%). The types of lymphocytes before and after interleukin 2 activation showed specific patterns. CD4+ helper T cells predominated in all tumors except melanomas, which had more CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. CD16+ natural killer cells were recovered in renal cell carcinoma and sarcomas. Three different cytotoxic lymphocytes were identified among interleukin 2-activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes: (1) CD3+ CD16- cytotoxic T lymphocytes with cytotoxicity restricted to autologous tumor cells in melanomas, (2) CD3-CD16+ natural killer cells with vigorous major histocompatibility complex-nonrestricted cytotoxicity in renal cell carcinoma, and (3) CD3+ CD16- T cells with modest levels of major histocompatibility complex-nonstricted cytotoxicity in all cancers except melanomas. Thus, there was considerable diversity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes among these histologically distinct tumors with respect to magnitude of lymphocyte infiltration, phenotypic expression, and functional capacity.","title":"Patterns of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 120 human cancers.","pubmedId":"1689143"}
