The local lymph node metastasis rate of the triple negative breast cancer was 22.22%, significantly higher than that of the non-triple negative breast cancer patients (2.70%, P \u003d 0.048). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and 10-year OS rate of he triple negative breast cancer patients were 79.67% and 63.15% respectively, both significantly lower than those of the non-triple negative breast cancer patients (88.59% and 83.28% respectively, both P \u003d 0.001). The 5-year and 10-year disease free survival (DFS) rates of the triple negative breast cancer patients were 77.94% and 62.87% respectively, both significantly lower than those of the non-triple negative breast cancer patients (83.82% and 82.53% respectively, both P \u003d 0.011), especially that within 36 months.\nTriple negative breast cancer is related with P53 and EGFR expression, and tends to metastasize to local lympho-nodes. The survival rate of triple negative breast cancer patients is significantly lower than that of non-triple negative breast cancer.","title":"[Clinical-pathological characteristics and survival of triple negative breast cancer].","pubmedId":"19552840"}
