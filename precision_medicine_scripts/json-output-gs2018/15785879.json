If detected early, it is easily treated by surgical excision. However, once melanoma metastasises it is notoriously resistant to existing therapies and for many patients the outlook is dismal. Thus a full description of melanoma etiology and a full understanding of the genetic lesions that underlie this disease is required to allow us to develop new and effective therapeutic strategies for its treatment. RAF proteins are a family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that form part of a signalling module that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. In mammals there are three isoforms, A-RAF, B-RAF and C-RAF, and recently it was shown that the B-RAF isoform is mutated in a high proportion of melanomas. In light of these exciting findings, we review what we have learned about B-RAF and its role in cutaneous melanoma.","title":"The role of B-RAF in melanoma.","pubmedId":"15785879"}
