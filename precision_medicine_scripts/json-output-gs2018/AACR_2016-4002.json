The development of immunotherapies like anti-PDL1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies has resulted in fundamental advances in the treatment of some cancers. However, long lasting responses are only observed in a subset of immunotherapy-treated patients. This shortfall highlights the need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern tumor response to immunotherapy.To address this need, autologous patient-derived tumor cell lines and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were utilized in an in vitro high throughput screen, to identify compounds that increase the sensitivity of melanoma cells to T cell mediated cytotoxicity. The screen consisted of an 850 compound library. One group of compounds that was most able to enhance T cell killing of melanoma cells was topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors such as topotecan and irinotecan.Our results indicate that treatment of melanoma cells with a Top1 inhibitor prior to exposure to autologous T cells produced a synergistic increase in tumor cell death, as measured by intracellular staining of activated caspase 3. We have also recapitulated this finding in an in vivo model, where a better anti-tumor effect was observed in tumor bearing mice treated with an antibody against the co-inhibitory molecule PDL1 in combination with MM398 (nanoliposomal irinotecan), than in cohorts treated with either -PDL1 or Top1 inhibitor alone. These findings suggest synergism between Top1 inhibitors and immune-based therapies in the treatment of melanoma.Molecular changes elicited by inhibition of Top1 are now being investigated to identify the factors that mediate the effect of Top1 inhibitors on T cell-mediated killing of melanoma. We have identified a p53-driven gene signature in Top1 inhibitor-treated melanoma cell lines and are investigating the functional relevance of Tumor Protein p53 Inducible Nuclear Protein 1 (TP53INP1) in mediating increased T cell killing of Top1 inhibitor-treated melanoma cells. Our results indicate that TP53INP1 is a critical component of this apoptotic response, as overexpression of TP53INP1 in melanoma cells increased their susceptibility to T cell mediated cytotoxicity. Complementary to this observation, we have also found that knockdown of TP53INP1 by shRNA, impedes the sensitivity of Top1 inhibitor-treated melanoma cells to T cell mediated killing.Understanding how Top1 inhibitors enhance melanoma killing by immunotherapy will allow for the development of predictive biomarkers, and also augment immune-based therapeutic strategies to ensure durable responses in a larger population of melanoma patients. By using melanoma as a model disease system, we can gain valuable insights into the dynamics of cancer immune response that may be applied to other cancers where effective treatment strategies are also lacking.","title":"Enhancing the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapy by using the topoisomerase I inhibitor MM398","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4002"}
