In contrast, the repertoire of possible molecular targets in SCLC is still unclear. Recent studies using next generation sequencing on rare resected SCLC specimens have provided insights into the molecular heterogeneity of this disease. Comprehensive, prospective molecular profiling of patients with SCLC using the small biopsy specimens available in clinical practice has not been performed.    Methods:  Utilizing an IRB-approved protocol to prospectively test SCLC tumors (Small Cell Lung Cancer Mutation Analysis Program, SC-MAP), these biopsies are evaluated by: FISH for FGFR1 and MET amplification; immunohistochemistry for MGMT and PTEN loss; point mutation genotyping with Sequenom for PIK3CA (and others); and next-generation sequencing with our MSK-IMPACT assay (Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets). MSK-IMPACT uses exon capture followed by massively parallel sequencing to profile all protein-coding exons and select introns of 279 cancer-associated genes, enabling the identification of mutations, indels, and copy number alterations of these genes. We tested the feasibility of this approach in a series of patients with SCLC. We performed next generation sequencing with MSK-IMPACT, with findings confirmed by FISH.  Results:  We identified 11 patients with SCLC with FFPE samples available from both matched normal tissue and small tumor biopsies, including 3 core biopsies and 8 fine needle aspirations. 9/11 patients had adequate tissue for MSK-IMPACT, which revealed recurrent mutations in Rb1 (N\u003d7) and p53 (N\u003d7), FGFR1 amplification (N\u003d2), and MET amplification (N\u003d1), using as little as 15 nanograms of DNA. FGFR1 and MET amplification were confirmed by FISH testing. We have initiated this prospective SC-MAP program for our patients with SCLC.  Conclusions:  Comprehensive molecular evaluation of SCLC is feasible on clinically available, small samples. Such analyses will allow us to characterize the molecular diversity of this disease and identify patients who will be candidates for targeted therapies.","title":"Prospective molecular evaluation of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) utilizing the comprehensive mutation analysis program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_116782-132"}
