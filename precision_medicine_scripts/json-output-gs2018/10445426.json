To understand the chemopreventive mechanism of curcumin against human malignancies, the cellular and molecular changes induced by this agent in human mammary epithelial (MCF-10A) and breast carcinoma (MCF- 7/TH) cell lines were investigated. The human multidrug- resistant breast cancer cell line was 3.5 fold more sensitive to curcumin than the mammary epithelial cell line. Even though both cell lines accumulated a similar amount of curcumin, a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells was induced in breast cancer cells compared to a very low percentage of apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells. Incubation of breast cancer cells with 20 and 40 microM curcumin for 24 h induced G2 block and sub-G0/G1 cell population, respectively. Curcumin treatment caused a reduction in the expression of Ki67, PCNA, and p53 mRNAs in breast cancer cells. The human mammary epithelial cell line showed a down-regulation of p21 mRNA and an up-regulation of Bax mRNA expression with curcumin treatment. The results suggest that apoptosis is involved in the curcumin-induced inhibition of tumor cell growth, and genes associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis may be playing a role in the chemopreventive action of curcumin.","title":"Differential sensitivity of human mammary epithelial and breast carcinoma cell lines to curcumin.","pubmedId":"10445426"}
