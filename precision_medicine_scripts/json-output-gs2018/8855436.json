The coronary angiogram revealed a proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis and an irregularity on the anterior wall of the left ventricle. Intraoperatively, a malignant melanoma, independent of the coronary stenosis, was identified and resected, and an internal mammary graft was inserted. No primary tumor was found. The patient is alive 18 months after operation, with a normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which seems to be the technique of choice for following-up heart melanomas.","title":"Primary melanoma of the heart: case report of an association with coronary stenosis.","pubmedId":"8855436"}
