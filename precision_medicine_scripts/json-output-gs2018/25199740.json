Recently, Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related carcinoma with adenoid cystic features was reported as a new histologic form. Although this histologic type resembles an adenoid cystic carcinoma, it differs from adenoid cystic carcinomas with regard to its association with HPV. Here, we present a case of HPV-related carcinoma with adenoid cystic features in the nasal cavity. We also review the histological characters of the tumor.
