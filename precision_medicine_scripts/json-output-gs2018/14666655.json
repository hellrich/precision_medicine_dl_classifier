We hypothesized that STI571 (Gleevec) would inhibit RET kinase and be a useful agent in the treatment of MTC.\nWe determined the IC50 of STI571 for RET using an in vitro kinase assay and also examined the effects of STI571 on cellular proliferation and viability in TT cells, a human MTC cell line.\nThe average in vitro IC50 of STI571 for RET is 37 microM +/- 4 microM. Additionally, TT cells incubated with 10 microM STI571 for up to 8 days showed no apparent reduction in cell proliferation or viability. Higher concentrations of STI571, from 25 to 100 microM, induced necrosis of TT cells.\nThe concentrations of STI571 required to significantly inhibit RET and to inhibit TT cell proliferation are not clinically achievable. We conclude that STI571 is not likely to be an effective treatment for MTC.","title":"RET tyrosine kinase and medullary thyroid cells are unaffected by clinical doses of STI571.","pubmedId":"14666655"}
