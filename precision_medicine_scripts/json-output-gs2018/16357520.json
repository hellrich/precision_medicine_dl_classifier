We recently identified mutations in the EGFR kinase domain in primary esophageal carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate if they are gefitinib-sensitizing EGFR mutations.\nWe identified a missense mutation in the EGFR kinase domain, EGRFS7681, in the esophageal cancer cell line Kyse450. The sensitivity of this cell line to gefitinib was compared to an esophageal cancer cell line with wildtype EGFR, TE8, and to a lung cancer cell line, H358, known to be resistant to gefitinib. The effect of EGFR(S7681) mutation on cell growth and apoptosis was assessed.\nAs demonstrated by in vitro proliferation assay, this mutation sensitized Kyse450 cells to gefitinib. The observation of down regulation of the phosphorylated pAKT indicated gefitinib induced Kyse450 cells apoptosis via inhibition of EGFR activity\nWhile more primary esophageal tumors remain to be screened for the mutations at the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, current observation implies that gefitinib may be worth further investigation for treatment of esophageal cancers.","title":"Gefitinib-sensitizing mutation in esophageal carcinoma cell line Kyse450.","pubmedId":"16357520"}
