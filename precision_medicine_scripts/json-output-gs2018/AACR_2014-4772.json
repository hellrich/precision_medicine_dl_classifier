ErbB2 is commonly amplified in breast, stomach, cervical, and bladder tumors and point mutations are found in many cancers. However, little is known about aberrant ErbB2 in hematologic malignancies. Deep sequencing was performed on primary leukemia patient samples and point mutations were identified within the extracellular receptor binding domains and the intracellular C-terminal region of ErbB2. Expression of these mutations in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts exhibited a transformed morphological phenotype and in Ba/F3 pro-B cells led to IL-3-independent growth and differential signaling within the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Further characterization of the mutations will assess migration properties, differential sensitivity to ErbB-family drug inhibitors, and heterodimer formation using bimolecular fluorescence complementation microscopy. Overall, this work identifies novel transforming ErbB2 mutations and may provide insight into effective therapy for leukemia patients harboring ErbB2 mutations.","title":"Novel transforming ErbB2 mutations in leukemia","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4772"}
