A few cases of combined biphenotypic/bilineal MPAL have been reported so far; they all had biphenotypic expressions in only one of the two distinct leukemic populations. A 43-year-old female presented with leukocytosis and bicytopenia. Her complete blood counts were: hemoglobin, 6.9 g/dL; white blood cells, 62.8×10(9)/L; and platelets, 83×10(9)/L. Neither lymphadenopathy nor organomegaly was observed. Blasts and promonocytes/monoblasts were increased in her peripheral blood (42%) and bone marrow (60.1%). Flow cytometric analysis revealed two distinct populations of leukemic cells, which expressed CD11c, CD19, and cytoplasmic CD79a in common. Additionally, the first population expressed CD10 and CD117 (B/myeloid), and the second one expressed CD14 and CD20 (B/monocytic). She had a karyotype of 46,XX,inv(9)(p12q13),t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[20] and BCR/ABL1 rearrangement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of biphenotypic/bilineal MPAL with B/myeloid and B/monocytic expressions.
