They markedly suppress plasma estrogen levels by inhibiting or inactivating aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of estrogens from androgenic substrates [1]. Currently, the three selective aromatase inhibitors that are available are anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane which reduce circulating estrogen to 1 to 10% of pretreatment levels [2]. For advanced breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors appear to be at a minimum, equivalent and perhaps even better than tamoxifen in the first line setting [3, 4]. In primary breast cancer, adjuvant therapy with anastrozole or letrozole appears to be superior to tamoxifen in reducing the risk of relapse [5, 6]. Common adverse effects associated with AI\u0027s include arthralgias (21%), myalgias (12%), other musculoskeletal disorders (28%) and an up to 60% increased risk of bone fracture [7, 8]. However, anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole are associated with significantly fewer endometrial cancers, as well as venous and arterial vascular events, when compared with tamoxifen [9, 10]. Very rarely letrozole and anastrozole can cause a skin rash; the frequency of its occurrence has not been quantified(. )However, exemestane has not been reported to cause a skin rash [11]. To date, erythema nodosum (EN) has not been reported as a dermatologic side effect of AI\u0027s. Here, we report three cases of EN which developed in postmenopausal breast cancer patients on AI\u0027s.","title":"Erythema nodosum secondary to aromatase inhibitor use in breast cancer patients: case reports and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"17972174"}
