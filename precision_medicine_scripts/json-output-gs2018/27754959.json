Nowadays the main tumor markers (TM) used in the diagnosis and follow-up of MTC patients are CT and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Nonetheless, progastrin releasing peptide (proGRP) has been recently proposed as a TM useful in the MTC. Our aims were to investigate the release of proGRP in thyroid tumors, its role in the assessment of advanced MTC and its utility in the differential diagnosis between MTC and non-MTC thyroid tumors.\nSerum samples from 22 patients with MTC and 16 with non-MTC were collected. Patients were classified into advanced cancer or no evidence of disease (NED). ProGRP was performed by Architect (Abbot Diagnostics), CT by Liaison (Diasorin) and CEA by Cobas E601(Roche Diagnostics).\nProGRP median concentration in advanced MTC was significantly higher (1398.4 pg/mL) when compared with non-MTC, either in advanced disease (24.9 pg/mL) or NED (14.6 pg/mL). In non-MTC patients, proGRP median concentration was below its cutoff level (50 pg/mL). Similar to CT, proGRP was able to detect 88.9% of MTC patients, but with a slightly lower specificity of 76.9%. Using proGRP together with CT the sensitivity increased to 100%.\nThe low prevalence of this malignancy strongly recommends further collaborative studies, mainly focused on monitoring proGRP during tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment for early detection of resistance and assessing its usefulness to avoid the observed false positive fluctuations that occur with CT and CEA.","title":"Utility of proGRP as a tumor marker in the medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"27754959"}
