Treatment with oral tremor agents is inconsistent and usually not satisfactory.\nWe implanted bilateral ventralis intermedius nuclei deep brain stimulators into an 82-year-old male with refractory orthostatic tremor.\nThe patient had a marked subjective and objective improvement in leg and arm tremor, mainly manifested by an improved ability to stand.\nBilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation may be considered in refractory cases of orthostatic tremor.","title":"Thalamic deep brain stimulation for orthostatic tremor.","pubmedId":"23439300"}
