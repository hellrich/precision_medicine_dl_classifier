We therefore tested the hypothesis that MMP-23 can negatively regulate the anti-tumor T cell response in human melanoma.  Methods:  We characterized MMP-23 expression in primary melanoma patients who received adjuvant immunotherapy. We examined the association of MMP-23 with the intrinsic anti-tumor immune response - as assessed by the prevalence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells. Further, we examined the association between MMP-23 expression and response to immunotherapy. Considering also an in trans mechanism, we examined the association of melanoma MMP-23 and melanoma Kv1.3 expression.  Results:  Our data revealed an inverse association between primary melanoma MMP-23 expression and the anti-tumor T-cell response, as demonstrated by decreased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (P\u003d0.05), in particular brisk TILs (P\u003d0.04), and a trend towards an increased proportion of immunosuppressive Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (P\u003d0.07). High melanoma MMP-23 expression is also associated with recurrence in patients treated with immune biologics (P\u003d0.037) but not in those treated with vaccines (P\u003d0.64). Further, high melanoma MMP-23 expression is associated with shorter periods of progression-free survival for patients receiving immune biologics (P\u003d0.025). On the other hand, there is no relationship between melanoma MMP-23 and melanoma Kv1.3 expression (P\u003d0.27).  Conclusions:  Our data support a role for MMP-23 as a potential immune checkpoint blockade target in melanoma, as well as a possible biomarker for informing melanoma immunotherapies.","title":"Matrix metalloproteinase-23 as a new immunotherapeutic checkpoint target in melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_126962-144"}
