Recently, we reported that mononuclear cells obtained from individuals treated with imatinib often exhibit an increase in the enzyme activity of the antioxidant selenoprotein, glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Treatment of the bcr-abl positive cell line KU812 resulted in increased GPx enzyme and GPx1 protein levels in a dose (100-150 nM) and time (0-7 days) dependent manner, with a maximal increase of 3-fold. Imatinib-induced changes in other anti-oxidant enzymes were also assessed. Of these, no change in the levels of either catalase or GPx-4 were detected, although the levels of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) increased by a maximal level of 4-fold in imatinib-treated cells. Similar results were obtained in another bcr-abl positive, CML cell line, MEG-01. The elevation in the levels of these proteins occurred via a post-transcriptional mechanism as no increase in the steady state levels of the corresponding mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The effect of imatinib was likely to be dependent on the presence of the bcr-abl fusion product as no changes in either GPx-1 or MnSOD were detected in either the immortalized lymphocyte cell line GM10832 or the prostate cancer-derived LNCaP human cell lines, neither of which contain bcr-abl. Since the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a known protein substrate for the abl kinase, and mTOR activity can regulate protein translation, it was investigated whether inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin (1ng/ml) affected GPx-1 and MnSOD levels. Exposure of the KU812 and MEG-01 cells, as well as LNCaP and GM10832 with rapamycin resulted in increased GPx-1 protein and enzyme levels (2- to 4-fold), but had no measurable effects on MnSOD. These results indicate that imatinib, likely by the inhibition of bcr-abl, can post-transcriptionally enhance both GPx-1 and MnSOD levels, although by different mechanisms. These data may have therapeutic significance as both of these anti-oxidant enzymes may influence several different clinically relevant biological processes, including DNA damage susceptability, cell signaling and apoptosis.","title":"Post-transciptional activation of anti-oxidant enzymes by imatinib","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-278"}
