We confirmed the status of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in each tumor focus by the real-time polymerase chain reaction technique.\nAmong the 85 patients, 49 (57.6%), 34 (40.0%), and 2 (2.4%) patients were determined to have all BRAF(V600E)-positive, mixed BRAF(V600E), and all BRAF(V600E)-negative in their tumor foci, respectively. When we compared clinicopathologic features according to the BRAF(V600E) mutation status of the dominant tumor, the BRAF(V600E) -positive group (n \u003d 70) showed more extrathyroidal invasion in the dominant tumor (32.9% vs 6.7%, P \u003d .041) and more lymph node metastasis (67.2% vs 40.0%, P \u003d .049) than the BRAF(V600E) -negative group (n \u003d 15). Considering all tumor foci, the all BRAF(V600E) mutation group exhibited a younger population (P \u003d .039), showed increased extrathyroidal invasion (38.8% vs 14.7%, P \u003d .017) and lymph node metastasis (71.4% vs 48.4%, P \u003d .038), and received more radioactive iodine therapy (79.2% vs 52.9%, P \u003d .012) than the mixed BRAF(V600E) mutation group. A larger tumor size and heavier preoperative body weight was positively correlated with the relative expression of BRAF(V600E) mutation calculated by 2(-△△Ct) method.\nMost of the Korean patients with multifocal PTC had the BRAF(V600E) mutation in one or more tumor foci, and all BRAF(V600E)-positive multifocal PTC showed more aggressive features.","title":"Clinical significance of the BRAF V600E mutation in multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma in Korea.","pubmedId":"24612623"}
