Scattered or focal staining (\u003c 25% of tumour cells) was seen in two additional ALK positive systemic ALCLs, two additional classic HD cases, and in three of 20 cases of ALK negative systemic nodal ALCL. Primary cutaneous ALCL showed no staining with the anti-MUC1 antibodies. Antibodies detecting hypoglycosylated MUC1 were found to be absent in all lymphomas (SM3) or present in only six of 15 ALK positive ALCLs (VU-4H5).\nMUC1 is preferentially expressed by a subtype of systemic nodal ALCL, characterised by ALK expression, but is found in only a few cases of classic HD and ALK negative ALCL. Therefore, although MUC1 could be used in a panel of markers for CD30 positive lymphomas, it is probably not a valuable tool to differentiate between ALK negative CD30 positive large cell lymphomas. Finally, the degree of MUC1 glycosylation in lymphomas is relatively high, compared with the aberrant hypoglycosylation found in adenocarcinomas.","title":"MUC1 (EMA) is preferentially expressed by ALK positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, in the normally glycosylated or only partly hypoglycosylated form.","pubmedId":"11729213"}
