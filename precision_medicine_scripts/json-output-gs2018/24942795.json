Patient 1 is a 61-year-old (yo) Japanese female whose clinical characteristics and findings of a genetic analysis of PTCH1 have been previously described. Patient 2 is patient 1\u0027s 64-yo sister who also suffered from NBCCS with a single base deletion at nucleotide 2613 in exon 16 (c.2613delC) in one PTCH1 allele. Thirteen and 3 independent specimens of BCC were applied for a molecular analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in PTCH1 in patients 1 and 2, respectively. Of particular note is that all BCC specimens examined showed a loss of the wild-type allele of exon 16 in PTCH1, thus indicating that LOH results in the biallelic disruption of PTCH1 in multiple BCCs that develop in an age- and location-independent manner in the same patient. These results indicate that the germline single base deletion of PTCH1 (c.2613 delC) is a first hit and the LOH of the wild-type allele is a second hit, implying that all 16 BCCs detected in these NBCCS sisters fit the standard two-hit model.
