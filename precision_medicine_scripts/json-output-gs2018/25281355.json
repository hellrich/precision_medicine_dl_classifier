Among patients \u003c60 years old, those with AML DNMT3A/FLT3/NPM1 had a shorter event-free survival (EFS) (p \u003d 0.047). DNMT3A mutations and not FLT3 or NPM1 mutations were independently associated with overall survival (OS) (p \u003d 0.026). Within mutation subgroups, patients with AML DNMT3A/NPM1 had a significantly shorter OS compared to those with AML FLT3-ITD/NPM1 (p \u003d 0.047) suggesting that the adverse impact of DNMT3A mutations is more pronounced than that of FLT3-ITD among patients with NPM1 mutation.\nDNMT3A has a significant dominant effect on the clinical features and outcomes of de novo AML patients with concurrent DNMT3A, FLT3 and NPM1 mutations.","title":"Clinical features of de novo acute myeloid leukemia with concurrent DNMT3A, FLT3 and NPM1 mutations.","pubmedId":"25281355"}
