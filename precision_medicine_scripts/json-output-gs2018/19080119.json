A feasible approach for an animal model to study OSCC lymph node metastasis was established and biological behaviors of three oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were compared.\nAfter implanting three kinds of cell lines (GDC185, Tca8113, Tca83) into three different anatomical sites in nude mice, namely the tongue, floor of the mouth, and axillary fossa, we observed the tumorigenicity and the metastatic capacity, which was confirmed by histopathology under a surgical microscope.\nThe animal model injected with GDC185 cells into the floor of the mouth had the highest rate of neck lymph node metastasis (55.6%) and the cell lines had significantly different biological behaviors.\nNude mice injected with GDC185 cells into the floor of the mouth could be used as a feasible animal model to study neck metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma.","title":"Establishment of cervical lymph node metastasis model of squamous cell carcinoma in the oral cavity in mice.","pubmedId":"19080119"}
