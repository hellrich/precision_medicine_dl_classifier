Only 60 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma have been described arising in the larynx. Four new cases are reported and the literature is reviewed. In the larynx, these tumors arise almost exclusively in the subglottic and supraglottic regions--areas having large numbers of seromucinous glands of the minor salivary gland type. These malignant tumors, whether occurring in the larynx or elsewhere, tend to grow quite slowly with prolonged non-specific symptomatology and protracted clinical course. Despite their slow growth, in a majority of cases, they eventually lead to the death of the patient.","title":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the larynx: a report of four cases and a review of the literature.","pubmedId":"198092"}
