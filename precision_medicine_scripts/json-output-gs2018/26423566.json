Understanding the T cell immune status of leukemia patients is critical for establishing specific immunotherapies. Previous studies have reported abnormal TCR repertoires and clonally expanded TCR Vβ T cells in chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CP-CML). In this study, we investigated the distribution and clonality of the TCR Vβ repertoire in 4 cases with imatinib-resistant CML in blast crisis (BC-CML) with abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) kinase domain mutations (KDMs). Examination of TCR V expression and clonality was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and GeneScan analysis. Significantly skewed TCR Vβ repertoires were observed in BC-CML patients with different KDMs, and 4 to 8 oligoclonally expanded TCR Vβ subfamilies could be identified in each sample. Intriguingly, a relatively highly expanded Vβ9 clone with the same length as complementarity- determining region 3 (CDR3) (139 bp) was found in all three CML patients in lymphoid blast crisis (LBC-CML) who had different KDMs, but the clone was not detected in the only CML patient in myeloid blast crisis (MBC-CML). In conclusion, restricted TCR Vβ repertoire expression and decreased clone complexity was a general phenomenon observed in the BC-CML patients with different KDMs, indicating the T-cell immunodeficiency of these patients. In addition, clonally expanded Vβ9 T cell clones may indicate a specific immune response to leukemia-associated antigens in LBC-CML patients.
