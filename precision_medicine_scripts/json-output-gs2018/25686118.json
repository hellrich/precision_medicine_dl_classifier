Point mutations were investigated by pyrosequencing.\nBRAF (5.2%) and KRAS 12-13 (31.9%) mutations were associated with poorer survival (HR 2.8 and 1.76, respectively). Presenting with right-sided colon cancer, not resected primary tumor, WBC \u003e10 Ã— 10(9)/l, receiving less chemotherapy or no bevacizumab were all associated with inferior outcome. The all-wild-type subgroup (39.2%) reported the longest survival.\nExtended mutational profile combined with clinical factors may impact on survival in mCRC.","title":"Prognostic role of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in advanced colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"25686118"}
