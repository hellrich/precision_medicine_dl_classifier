In all cases of Ca-ex-PA, a PSA \u0027ghost\u0027 was identified and the malignant element was either undifferentiated carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining and evaluation for CDKN2A and FHIT in 55 specimens were undertaken.\nThe results showed positive nuclear expression of p16 and FHIT in normal parotid gland. None (0%) of the PSA cases demonstrated loss of expression of nuclear FHIT, while 6/26 (23.1%) showed loss of FHIT express. Loss of CDKN2A expression was found in 12/29 (41.4%) of PSAs and 8/26 (30.8%) of Ca-ex-PAs. The nuclear expression pattern for FHIT was significantly more frequent in Ca-ex-PAs compared to PSAs (p\u003d0.014).\nOur data suggest that inactivation of tumour suppressor genes plays an important role in the evolution of Ca-ex-PA. Furthermore, alteration of CDKN2A expression was found to be an early event in the malignant transformation of pleomorphic adenoma and could be considered as a target for gene therapy. More interestingly, we found that nuclear FHIT expression could be used as a good marker to distinguish PSA from Ca-ex-PA.","title":"The expression of FHIT in salivary carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.","pubmedId":"22843886"}
