Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a procedure performed for non-medical reasons that is not traditionally encountered in Canada and that has serious health implications for women.\nA 36-year-old woman, who underwent FGM at the age of four, presented to our colposcopy unit with increasing swelling of the vulva. Examination revealed a large cystic mass in the midline of the vulva, and MRI identified two well-defined cystic lesions. The mass was excised, and histologic examination confirmed an epidermal inclusion cyst.\nAn epidermal inclusion cyst can develop as a long-term consequence of FGM. Although it grows slowly and usually without symptoms, it may require excision because of inflammation, secondary infection, or, in rare cases, malignancy developing within the cyst.","title":"Late complications of childhood female genital mutilation.","pubmedId":"20569540"}
