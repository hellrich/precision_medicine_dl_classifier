We studied 521 patients with CN-AML in CR1, for whom mutational status of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD was available, including the FLT3-ITD allelic ratio. PRT consisted of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) (n\u003d68), myeloablative conditioning (MAC) alloHSCT (n\u003d137), autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT) (n\u003d168) or chemotherapy (n\u003d148). Favorable overall survival (OS) was found for patients with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (71±4%). Outcome in patients with a high FLT3-ITD allelic ratio appeared to be very poor with OS and relapse-free survival (RFS) of 23±8% and 12±6%, respectively. Patients with wild-type NPM1 without FLT3-ITD or with a low allelic burden of FLT3-ITD were considered as intermediate-risk group because of similar OS and RFS at 5 years, in which PRT by RIC alloHSCT resulted in better OS and RFS as compared with chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.56, P\u003d0.022 and HR 0.50, P\u003d0.004, respectively) or autoHSCT (HR 0.60, P\u003d0.046 and HR 0.60, P\u003d0.043, respectively). The lowest cumulative incidence of relapse (23±4%) was observed following MAC alloHSCT. These results suggest that alloHSCT may be preferred in patients with molecularly intermediate-risk CN-AML, while the choice of conditioning type may be personalized according to risk for non-relapse mortality.Leukemia advance online publication, 15 July 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.183.","title":"Comparative value of post-remission treatment in cytogenetically normal AML subclassified by NPM1 and FLT3-ITD allelic ratio.","pubmedId":"27416910"}
