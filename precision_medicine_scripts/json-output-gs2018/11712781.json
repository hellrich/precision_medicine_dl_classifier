However, no data concerning the three mistletoe lectins (MLs) and the spread of malignant melanoma have been published.\nThe binding status of ML-I, -II and -III was histochemically assessed in 100 malignant melanomas and correlated with metastasis in a 10 year follow-up period. Furthermore, the staining intensity of the three MLs, scored from negative (-) to very intense (+ + +), was evaluated.\nKaplan-Meier analsis revealed that very intense binding (+ + +) of ML-I was positively-correlated with metastasis (p\u003d0.044).\nSince ML-I is specific for galactose, high density galactose expression in malignant melanoma is a predictor of poor prognosis.","title":"Binding of mistletoe lectins to cutaneous malignant melanoma: implications for prognosis and therapy.","pubmedId":"11712781"}
