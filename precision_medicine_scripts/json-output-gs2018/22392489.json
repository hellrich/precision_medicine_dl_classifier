Immunostaining was mostly focal and weak in the normal endometrium and was mostly diffuse and strong in the simple and complex endometrial hyperplasia.\nSimple and complex hyperplastic endometrial tissues express diffuse cytoplasmic staining for c-kit and the expression decreases with the progression of the lesion.","title":"c-Kit proto-oncogene expression in endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.","pubmedId":"22392489"}
