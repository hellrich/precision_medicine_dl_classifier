Adenocancers are histopathologically more common. Males are more affected than females, an effect which is directly related to smoking. They generally cause distant haematogenous and lymphatic metastasis. Distant haematogenous metastases are often seen in contralateral lung, brain, bone, adrenals, and liver. Muscle metastases from NSCLC are quite rare and male cases are more frequently affected compared to female cases. NSCLC cases with muscle metastasis are at the same time accompanied by distant organ metastases such as bone, brain, and liver. All treatment approaches are considered to be palliative in these cases, which are symptomatologically quite severe. In the present study, we presented the rarely observed cases of two male patients with muscle metastasis from NSCLC together with the related literature.
