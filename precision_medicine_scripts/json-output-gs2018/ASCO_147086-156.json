The activity and toxicity of oxaliplatin (O)-capecitabine (C) (capox) with P have been questioned by previous studies.  Methods:  Pts with exon 2 KRAS WT mCRC received first-line chemotherapy with the combination of O 130 mg/m2, C 2000 mg/m2 and P 9 mg/Kg, repeated every 3 weeks for at least 6 cycles or until disease progression (PD) or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). According to Simon\u0027s 2-stage optimal design, assuming the expected ORR to be at least 60% and the minimum acceptable ORR 45%, 77 pts were required at the final step.  Results:  78 pts were enrolled. Median age was 65.5 years, males 58%, females 42%, ECOG performance status 0 (80%), 1 (19%) and 2 (1%). 44 pts (54%) completed 6 cycles. Most frequent reasons of discontinuation were PD (11 pts), toxicity (7 pts), pt refusal (7 pts) and doctors decision (4 pts). Relative dose intensities were 99.8% for P, 96.6% for O and 81.8% for C. Grade 3-4 toxicities were anemia (4%), leukopenia (1%), neutropenia (3%), thrombocytopenia (4%), skin toxicity (19%), diarrhea (10%), neuropathy (5%), hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia (5%), hand-foot syndrome (4%) and mucositis (3%). Two toxic deaths from cardiac arrest occurred (3%), the first in a pt with grade 4 neutropenia and the other in a pt with grade 3 diarrhea. ORR was 56% (complete 8%, partial 49%), stable disease 18%, PD 8%, non-evaluable pts 2.5% and early discontinuation 14%. After a median follow-up of 30 months, median PFS was 8.1 (95% CI 6.8-9.4) and median OS 20.2 (95% CI 15.4-25.8). Among 61 pts evaluated for mutations, 8 (13%) had an exon 3-4 KRAS nutation, 2 (3%) NRAS, 4 (7%) BRAF, 4 (7%) PIK3CA and 2 (3%) AKT1 nutations. Patients with KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutations compared with all RAS/BRAF WT patients did not differ in terms of ORR (50% vs. 55%, respectively), PFS (7.7 vs 8.1, respectively) and OS (20.2 vs 19.2, respectively).  Conclusions:  First-line capox-P did not appear to exhibit improved safety and activity in pts with KRAS WT mCRC.
