We therefore performed a meta-analysis to evaluate its prognostic significance.\nWe searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for published literature investigating associations between HER-2/neu status and overall survival of patients with CRC. A meta-analysis was performed using a DerSimonian-Laird model and publication bias was investigated by Begg\u0027s and Egger\u0027s tests. Subgroup analysis was also conducted according to the study design type, study quality score, cut-off value for HER-2/neu overexpression, publication region, patient number and publication year.\nA total of 17 eligible studies involving 2,347 patients were identified for this meta-analysis. The combined hazard ratio (HR) was 1.31 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96-1.79), suggesting that HER-2/neu overexpression was not significantly associated with overall survival of patients with CRC. However, subgroup analysis revealed that HER-2/neu overexpression had an unfavorable impact on survival when the analysis was restricted to subgroups of study quality score ≤ 5 (HR\u003d1.56, 95%CI: 1.17-2.10), Asian patients (HR\u003d1.74, 95%CI: 1.22-2.49), patient number ≤ 106 (HR\u003d1.57, 95%CI: 1.01-2.44), publication year before 2003 (HR\u003d1.59, 95%CI: 1.02-2.49), and prospectively designed study (HR\u003d3.62, 95%CI: 1.42-9.24). The effect disappeared in subgroups of study quality scores \u003e 5 (HR\u003d0.69, 95%CI: 0.33-1.44), non Asian patients (HR\u003d1.14, 95%CI: 0.77-1.70), patients\u0027 number \u003e 106 (HR\u003d1.07, 95%CI: 0.67-1.72), publication year after 2003 (HR\u003d1.13, 95%CI: 0.76-1.69), and retrospectively designed study (HR\u003d1.22, 95%CI: 0.89-1.67).\nOur meta-analysis suggests that HER-2/neu overexpression might not be a significantly prognostic indicator for patients with CRC. Further studies are required to confirm these results.","title":"Lack of effects of HER-2/neu on prognosis in colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"25081663"}
