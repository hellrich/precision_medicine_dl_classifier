ErbB2 (HER-2/neu) has been identified as an important regulator of metastatic potential of breast cancer. The present study investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the role of ErbB2 in malignant phenotypic conversion of MCF10A human breast epithelial cells which originally have \u0027normal\u0027 cell character. Here we report that ErbB2 induces invasion and migration of MCF10A cells though up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. We also observed a marked reduction of an epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, and an induction of vimentin in ErbB2-MCF10A cells, suggesting that epithelial-mesenchymal transition may play a role in the ErbB2-induced invasion and migration of MCF10A cells. Overexpression of ErbB2 significantly activated p38 MAPK and Akt, while Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway was not activated by ErbB2. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we further show that p38 MAPK and Akt signaling pathways are crucial for the ErbB2-induced MMP-9 up-regulation, invasion and migration of MCF10A cells. Given that ErbB2 is one of the most important oncogenes in human breast cancer and thus is an attractive therapeutic target, our findings may provide a molecular basis for the promoting role of ErbB2 in breast cancer progression.","title":"Overexpression of ErbB2 induces invasion of MCF10A human breast epithelial cells via MMP-9.","pubmedId":"19022565"}
