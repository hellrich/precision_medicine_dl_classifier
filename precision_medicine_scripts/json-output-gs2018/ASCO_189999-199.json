Identification of preoperative prognostic biomarkers is needed to ascertain risk of relapse and guide postoperative management. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) represents a strong prognostic factor in unresectable metastatic (stage IV) melanoma, but its relevance in patients with resected stage III or IV disease remains unknown. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients with stage III and IV melanoma who had undergone complete resection of disease and received follow-up treatment at Mayo Clinic, Rochester between January 1, 2000 and January 31, 2012. Clinical data were collected from electronic records. Survival data were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Associations of preoperative LDH with time to relapse and death were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models and summarized with hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 154 subjects with resectable stage III or IV melanoma were included in the study. Median age at the time of resection was 58; 54 (35.1%) were female. One-hundred sixteen (75.3%) patients were classified as stage III and 38 (24.7%) stage IV. Adjuvant systemic treatment was administered in 75 (48.7%) patients and adjuvant radiation in 32 (20.7%). Median duration of follow-up was 4.0 years. Sixteen (10.3%) patients had preoperative LDH above the upper limit of normal. Each 50-unit increase in LDH was associated with a 15% increased risk of relapse (HR 1.15; p \u003d 0.040) and 23% increased risk of death (HR 1.23; p \u003d 0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, stage, number of sites, adjuvant systemic treatment, and adjuvant radiation, preoperative LDH remained associated with time to death (HR 1.25; p \u003d 0.002). Preoperative LDH greater than the upper limit of normal was associated with increased hazard of death, both with univariate (HR 2.44; p \u003d 0.005) and multivariate (HR 2.17; p \u003d 0.017) analyses. Conclusions: This study supports the role of elevated preoperative LDH as a predictor of inferior outcomes in patients with advanced melanoma. Further study to correlate LDH to outcomes in the era of adjuvant immunotherapy is required.","title":"The prognostic role of preoperative serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in patients with resected advanced melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_189999-199"}
