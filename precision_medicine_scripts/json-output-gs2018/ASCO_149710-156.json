Currently, there are no validated markers to assess early disease response during treatment. We hypothesize that a change in LDH from baseline to cycle 2 can predict which pts are likely to progress or receive benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors  Methods:  We performed a retrospective analysis of MM pts treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 agents at Mayo Clinic and Vanderbilt from 04/2014-present. We used investigator described responses to categorize responders (complete and partial remissions) versus non-responders (stable and progressive disease). We used Fishers exact test to determine whether a change in LDH correlated with response.  Results:    We evaluated 65 MM pts treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 agents with available LDH levels. Among all pts, there was a trend that increasing LDH at cycle 2 associated with non-response (64% vs 36%, p\u003d0.13). In pts with a baseline elevated LDH, a further rise in LDH strongly associated with non-response (93% vs 7%, p\u003d0.005) whereas most pts with a decrease in LDH responded to therapy (54%).  In pts with a normal baseline LDH, a change in LDH did not associate with response or lack of response (see table below).  Conclusions:  In pts with a baseline elevated LDH treated with anti PD-1/PD-L1, a further rise in LDH at cycle 2 (week 3) strongly associates with progression. A change in LDH does not predict benefit in those with a baseline normal LDH. Independent validation in larger studies is necessary to confirm these findings.
