Genes most commonly associated with the process of oncogenesis include: p53 inactivating mutation; hDM2 overexpression; p16 reduced expression; K-/H-RAS activating mutation; PTEN inactivating mutation/deletion; EGFR activating mutation and overexpression; retinoblastoma inactivating mutation and deletion; Cyclin proteins overexpression; CD95 reduced expression; protective BCL-2 proteins overexpression; to name but just a few of such molecules.(1-5) That the minimally required specific proteins for oncogenesis are not known for many specific tumor types remains a challenge for the rational design of molecular targeted therapies.","title":"The multi-hit hypothesis in basal-like breast cancer.","pubmedId":"23974512"}
