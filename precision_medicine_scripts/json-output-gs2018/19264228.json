A frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 10q is found in melanoma; however, little is known about the role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of a primary malignant melanoma derived from ovarian mature cystic teratoma, which is an extremely rare melanoma. This study examined the genetic alterations involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pathways in an ovarian malignant melanoma. A LOH analysis revealed hemizygous deletion around and in the PTEN gene not only in the ovarian melanoma but also in a mature cystic teratoma. Another case of ovarian mature cystic teratomas in the absence of melanoma also showed allelic loss of the PTEN region. To date, mutations of BRAF, NRAS, and KIT genes have been reported in malignant melanomas. In the present study, D816H and K558E mutations of the KIT gene were revealed in the melanoma arising from a mature cystic teratoma, but not in a mature cystic teratoma. No mutations of the BRAF and NRAS genes were found in the melanoma. These results indicate that LOH of the PTEN region is one of the molecular alterations of an ovarian mature cystic teratoma and a KIT mutation is an additional promotional event associated with the oncogenesis of a melanoma arising from an ovarian mature cystic teratoma.","title":"Mutations of the KIT gene and loss of heterozygosity of the PTEN region in a primary malignant melanoma arising from a mature cystic teratoma of the ovary.","pubmedId":"19264228"}
