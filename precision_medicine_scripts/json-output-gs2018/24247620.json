Clinicopathological parameters, recurrence and mortality were analysed according to BRAF mutation status.\nMedian follow-up was 84.5 months. BRAF mutation was demonstrated in 65% of cases combining both C-PCR and IHC; in 71% (37/77) of tumours \u003e1 cm and 52% (13/25) of microcarcinomas (\u003c1 cm). IHC was positive in 69% (49/71) and C-PCR in 53% (41/77); 87% (67/77) of our patients were treated with total thyroidectomy and 65% (50/77) also had radioactive ablation. BRAF positive tumours had a significantly higher rate of subsequent lymph node metastases (p\u003d0.035). Significant association was found between BRAF mutation and male sex (p\u003d0.034), but not between age \u003e45 years at diagnosis, size of primary tumour, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node or distant metastases or clinical stage at diagnosis.\nBRAF mutation in PTC determined by IHC is associated with significantly increased risk of lymph node recurrence.","title":"The prognostic significance of the BRAF V600E mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma detected by mutation-specific immunohistochemistry.","pubmedId":"24247620"}
