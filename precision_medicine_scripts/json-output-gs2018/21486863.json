Our objective was to identify T-cell subsets with reduced in vitro reactivity to allogeneic HLA antigens.\nWe sorted CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets from peripheral blood by flow cytometry according to their expression of naive and memory markers CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L, and CCR7. Subsets were defined by a single marker to facilitate future establishment of a clinical-grade procedure for reducing alloreactive T-cell precursors and graft-versus-host disease. T cells were stimulated in mixed lymphocyte reactions against HLA-deficient K562 cells transfected with single HLA-A/-B/-C/-DR/-DQ mismatch alleles. Alloreactivity was measured by interferon-γ spot production and cell proliferation.\nWe observed that allogeneic HLA-reactivity was preferentially derived from subsets enriched for naïve T cells rather than memory T cells in healthy donors, irrespective of the HLA mismatch allele. This separation was most efficient if CD45RA (versus other markers) was used for sorting. The numbers of allogeneic HLA-reactive effector cells were in median 7.2-fold and 16.6-fold lower in CD45RA(neg) memory CD8 and CD4 T cells than in entire CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively. In contrast, proliferation of memory T cells in response to allogeneic HLA was more variably reduced (CD8) or equivalent (CD4) when compared to that of naïve T cells. We also demonstrated in HLA-matched donor-patient pairs that leukemia-reactive CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes were mainly derived from subsets enriched for naïve T cells compared to memory T cells.\nMemory T-cell subsets of most healthy individuals showed decreased allogeneic HLA-reactivity, but lacked significant anti-leukemia responses in vitro. The clinical use of memory or naïve-depleted T cells might be beneficial for HLA-mismatched patients at high risk of graft-versus-host disease and low risk of leukemia relapse. Preferred allografts are those which contain leukemia-reactive memory T cells. Alternatively, replenishment with leukemia-reactive T cells isolated from naïve subsets is desirable.","title":"Alloreactive and leukemia-reactive T cells are preferentially derived from naive precursors in healthy donors: implications for immunotherapy with memory T cells.","pubmedId":"21486863"}
