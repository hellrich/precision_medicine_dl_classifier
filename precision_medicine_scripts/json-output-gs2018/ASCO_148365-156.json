While promising, many pts do not benefit clinically. Predictive biomarkers to guide pt selection are needed. We hypothesized that tumor antigen presentation (MHC-I or MHC-II expression) is a requirement of PD-1 benefit, and presence of these cell surface markers would predict benefit.  Methods:  We profiled MHC-I/II mRNA across 60 MEL cell lines. The transcriptional characteristics of MHC-II+ cell lines were analyzed by Gene Set Analysis. Cell surface expression of MHC-I and MHC-II was confirmed by flow cytometry (FC) in a subset of cell lines under basal and stimulated (IFN) conditions. In 26 tumor samples from PD-1 treated MEL pts, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for HLA-DR (MHC-II) or HLA-A (MHC-I), SOX10, CD4 and CD8. IHC results were correlated with response and progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:  MHC-I mRNA was expressed in all cell lines while MHC-II expression was bimodal (60% positive). MHC-II+ cell lines had transcriptional signatures of the PD-1 signaling, allograft rejection, and T-cell receptor signaling. By FC, MHC-II+ (mRNA) cell lines were constitutive and inducible (IFN stimulation) for HLA-DR while MHC-II- cells did not express or induce HLA-DR. In contrast, all tested cell lines significantly upregulated PD-L1 with IFN stimulation. Of 26 pts treated with PD-1, 10 were MHC-II+. All 10 MHC-II+ (100%) pts had partial, complete, or mixed responses (MR), while only 7/16 (44%) of MHC-II- pts benefited (Fishers exact p \u003d 0.004). Excluding MR pts (n \u003d 2), median PFS for MHC-II+ was 728 days (d), while the median PFS for MHC-II- tumors was 98d (log-rank p \u003d 0.01) . MHC-II+tumors had enhanced CD4 and CD8 infiltrate (Pearsons correlation p \u003d 0.000002 and p \u003d 0.03, respectively). MHC-I positivity was ubiquitous and not associated with response.  Conclusions:  A subset of MEL demonstrates an MHC-II signature that correlates with PD-1 response and enhanced CD4/CD8 T-cell infiltrate. MHC-II+ tumors can be robustly identified by routine melanoma-specific IHC for HLA-DR to guide pt selection. Combining HLA-DR IHC with other biomarkers, including PD-L1 expression may further improve pt selection.","title":"Melanoma-specific MHC-II expression to predict response to -PD-1 therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_148365-156"}
