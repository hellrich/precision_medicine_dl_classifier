CXCR2 was an inflammation receptor and expressed in gastric cancer. But its association with macrophage remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the role of macrophage in the development of gastric cancer from inflammation.Methods: Human GC cell lines AGS, BGC-823 were studied. Western Blot was used to detect the protein expression in gastric cancer cells. Migration of gastric cancer cells were tested by Transwell.Results: Macrophages and gastric cancer cell lines can secret CXCR2 ligands when coculutred with each other. CXCR2 knock down in gastric cancer cells can decrease migration and inhibit EMT. Macrophage promotes EMT of gastric cancer though CXCR2 signaling. CXCR2\u0027s ligands CXCL1 and CXCL5 can activate stat3 and promote the migration of gastric cancer cells. CXCL1 and CXCL5 are responsible for the EMT of gastric cancer.Conclusion: Macrophage can promote gastric cancer EMT through activating CXCR2 signaling. CXCR2 ligands CXCL1 and CXCL5 are the crucial factors for promoting EMT in gastric cancer.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.","title":"Macrophage promotes EMT in gastric cancer through activating CXCR2 signaling","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-432"}
