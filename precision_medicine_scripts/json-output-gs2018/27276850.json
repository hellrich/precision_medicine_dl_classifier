The objective of this study is to present our technique and results of laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy.\nA 72-year-old Thai male presented with gross hematuria. Cystoscope was performed. Large bladder tumor near right ureteric orifice was observed. Then, transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed. His tumor pathology was muscle invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma with clinical staging T2N0M0. Laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy was then conducted with bilateral pelvic nodes dissection and ileal conduit.\nOperation period was eight hours. Blood loss was 500 ml. In pathological results, tumor invaded bladder muscle into perivesical tissue. Tumor margin was free. Lymph nodes were positive for malignancy 5/7 for right side and 0/4 for left side. Pathological staging was T3aN1M0. After post-operative period, the patient was discharged from hospital uneventfully.\nLaparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy in Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center is minimal invasive, feasible and safe. However, a longer follow-up period regarding long-term cancer control as well as functional and technical aspects will be required.","title":"Laparoscopic Radical Cystoprostatectomy, Surgical Technique and Result: A Case Report.","pubmedId":"27276850"}
