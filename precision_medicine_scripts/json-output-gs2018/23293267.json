Within this global scenario, the results of 2010 concerning screening programs can be considered as still positive even if the gap between the North and the Central Regions as compared to the South remains. In short, in 2010 almost 9.5 millions people were invited to undergo a screening examination (3,450,000; 2,496,000 and 3,464,000 for cervical, mammographic and colorectal cancer respectively). As compared to the previous year, a large increase was observed for colorectal screening.Whereas a slight decrease was observed both for cervical and for mammographic screening. The latter trend was partially due to the overload consequent to the extension of the programme to women younger than fifty in a couple of regions (Emilia-Romagna and Piemonte). More than 4.3 millions of subjects actually complied to the invitation (1,375,000; 1,382,000 and 1,582,000 for cervical, mammographic and colorectal cancer, respectively). As a consequence of these activities were identified 6,015 breast cancers (31% of annual occurring breast cancers in Italy in the age group 50-69 years according to the most update estimates of breast cancer occurrence), 4,597 CIN2 or more severe cervical lesions, 2,916 colorectal cancers (15% of annual occurring CRC cancer in Italy in the age group 50-69 years) and 15,049 advanced adenomas.","title":"[The diffusion of screening programmes in Italy, year 2010].","pubmedId":"23293267"}
