In contrast, several studies report lack of BRAF mutations in uveal melanoma including primary and metastatic choroidal and ciliary body melanomas. To our knowledge, for the first time, here we report a case of choroidal melanoma harboring the BRAF mutation (V600E). The activation of RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, although independent of BRAF mutation, was reported in uveal melanoma. The presence of V600E mutation indicates that the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, in addition to cutaneous melanoma progression, may play a role in the choroidal melanoma development.","title":"Detection of BRAF gene mutation in primary choroidal melanoma tissue.","pubmedId":"16410717"}
