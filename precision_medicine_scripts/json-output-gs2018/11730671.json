In a 49-year-old Caucasian female, a primary choroidal melanoma, left eye, was diagnosed and treated with Ruthenium-106 plaque radiotherapy. The choroidal melanoma showed excellent regression with flattening of the mass and adjacent chorioretinal atrophy.\nFifteen years after brachytherapy for choroidal melanoma, left eye, the patient developed a metastatic melanoma to the contralateral choroid as the first sign of metastasis. No history of oculo(dermal) melanocytosis or cutaneous melanoma existed. Systemic evaluation disclosed multiple metastases confined to the liver.\nMetastasis to the contralateral choroid can be the first sign of metastasis from choroidal melanoma.","title":"Choroidal melanoma metastatic to the contralateral choroid.","pubmedId":"11730671"}
