Here, we report a rare case of ovarian mixed neoplasm with parts of malignant melanoma and fibrothecoma in a 76-year-old female who was hospitalized for a cataract operation. To our knowledge, cases of a combination of malignant melanoma and fibrothecoma in the ovary have not been described. In this study, new markers for malignant melanoma (S-100, tyrosinase mRNA) were also tested.","title":"Malignant melanoma and fibrothecoma--an ovarian mixed tumor.","pubmedId":"16033067"}
