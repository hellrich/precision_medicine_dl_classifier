FLT3-ITD mutations are heterogeneous with respect to allelic ratio, location, and length of the insertion, with a high mutant-to-wild-type ratio consistently associated with inferior prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed the role of alloHCT in first remission in relationship to the allelic ratio and presence or absence of nucleophosmin 1 mutations (NPM1) in the Study Alliance Leukemia AML2003 trial. FLT3-ITD mutations were detected in 209 patients and concomitant NPM1 mutations in 148 patients. Applying a predefined cutoff ratio of .8, AML was grouped into high- and low-ratio FLT3-ITD AML (HR(FLT3-ITD) and LR(FLT3-ITD)). Sixty-one patients (29%) were transplanted in first remission. Overall survival (OS) (HR, .3; 95% CI, .16 to .7; P \u003d .004) and event-free survival (EFS) (HR, .4; 95% CI, .16 to .9; P \u003d .02) were significantly increased in patients with HR(FLT3-ITD) AML who received alloHCT as consolidation treatment compared with patients who received consolidation chemotherapy. Patients with LR(FLT3-ITD) AML and wild-type NPM1 who received alloHCT in first remission had increased OS (HR, .3; 95% CI, .1 to .8; P \u003d .02) and EFS (HR, .2; 95% CI, .1 to .8; P \u003d .02), whereas alloHCT in first remission did not have a significant impact on OS and EFS in patients with LR(FLT3-ITD) AML and concomitant NPM1 mutation. In conclusion, our results provide additional evidence that alloHCT in first remission improves EFS and OS in patients with HR(FLT3-ITD) AML and in patients with LR(FLT3-ITD) AML and wild-type NPM1.
