Tumor cells expressing NPM-ALK exhibit markedly enhanced proliferative activity, but comparative cellular kinetic studies on ALK(+) (ALK lymphomas) and ALK(-) lymphomas are lacking. The present study showed that ALK(+) lymphomas, detected with the monoclonal antibody ALKc (n \u003d 17), had significantly higher average values for the proliferation-associated parameters mitotic index, ana/telophase index, growth index (x x mitotic index - apoptotic index, assuming x \u003d 3), percentages of Ki-67(+) cells and fraction of cells expressing cyclin A or B or the cell cycle-regulatory protein p34(cdc2) than did ALK(-) ALCLs (n \u003d 15). Whether this intense proliferative activity contributes to the good response to chemotherapy and favorable outcome of ALK(+) ALCLs remains to be assessed in a larger series of patients. Our findings support the notion that ALK(+) and ALK(-) ALCLs are 2 distinct disease entities.","title":"Expression of the ALK protein by anaplastic large-cell lymphomas correlates with high proliferative activity.","pubmedId":"10842190"}
