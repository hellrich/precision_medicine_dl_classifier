Nodular melanoma (NM) has a worse prognosis than superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), which is usually attributed to thicker primary tumors. Herein, we examine the hypothesis that HS might have an impact on MSS independent of thickness and that NM and SSM exhibit different mutational landscapes that associate with response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy (IT) and BRAF targeted therapy (TT) in the metastatic setting. Methods: Primary NM and SSM patients prospectively enrolled at NYU (2002 - 2016) were compared to the most recent SEER cohort (1973 - 2012) and analyzed with respect to MSS. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed on a subset of matched tumor-germline pairs, allowing a comparison of the mutational landscape between NM and SSM. In the metastatic setting, survival analyses were used to compare outcomes and responses to treatment across HS. Results: The NYU cohort of 1,621 patients with either NM (n \u003d 510) or SSM (n \u003d 1,111) was representative of the analogous SEER cohort (21,339 NM, 97,169 SSM), with NM presenting as thicker, more ulcerated, and later stage (all p \u003c 0.001). Among the NYU cohort, NM was found to have lower rates of TIL (p \u003d 0.047), higher mitotic index (p \u003c 0.001), and higher rates of NRAS mutation (p \u003c 0.001). In multivariate Cox models, NM was a significant predictor of worse MSS, independent of thickness and stage (p \u003d 0.01). NM had a significantly lower mutational burden across the exome (p \u003c 0.001). Some of the most under-mutated genes noted in NM were NOTCH4, BCL2L12 and RPS6KA6 (all p \u003c 0.01). Among patients treated with TT (n \u003d 56), NM remained a significant predictor of worse MSS (p \u003d 0.004). However, there was no difference in response to IT. Conclusions: NM and SSM show divergent mutational patterns which may contribute to their different clinical behaviors and responses to BRAF targeted therapy. More studies are needed to better understand the key molecular and cellular processes driving such differences. Integration of HS data into prospective clinical trial reporting is needed to better assess its impact on response to treatment.","title":"Primary melanoma histologic subtype (HS) impacts melanoma specific survival (MSS) and response to systemic therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_193552-199"}
