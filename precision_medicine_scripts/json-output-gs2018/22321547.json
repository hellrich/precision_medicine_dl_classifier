The relationship of EGFR gene mutations in NSCLC with clinicopathological features and prognosis were analyzed.\nEGFR mutations were detected in 120 of 282 (42.6%) patients with NSCLC. There were 61 cases of the mutations in exon 19 and 66 cases of the mutations in exon 21, including 7 cases of the mutations both in exons 19 and 21. Mutations were more frequently observed in women (55.2%, 53/96) than in men (36.0%, 67/186), in 51 to 60-years-old (51.3%, 39/76) than â‰¤50-years-old (30.4%, 21/69) and \u003e60-years-old (43.8%, 60/137), in non-smokers (54.3%, 69/127) than smokers (32.9%, 51/155), there was negative correlation of EGFR mutations with smoking status (P\u003d0.000, rs\u003d-0.216). EGFR mutations were more frequently observed in adenocarcinomas (47.8%, 64/134), bronchiolo-alveolar carcinomas (73.0%, 27/37), adenosquamous carcinomas (7/9) than squamous cell carcinomas (23.6%, 17/72) and other types (16.7%, 5/30). The EGFR mutation rate in the well differentiated, the middle differentiated, the poorly differentiated and the undifferentiated was 55.7% (68/122), 50.8% (30/59), 22.7% (17/75), 19.2% (5/26) respectively, the incidences of EGFR mutations decreased with the degrading of differentiation, there was positive correlation of EGFR mutations with differentiation of lung cancer (P\u003d0.000, rs\u003d0.296). The patients with EGFR mutations had better prognosis than those with wild-type EGFR (P\u003d0.027). There was no association of EGFR mutations with clinical TNM stage.\nEGFR mutations occur frequently in females, non-smokers and adenocarcinomas, bronchioloalveolar carcinomas, and adenosquamous carcinomas. The patients with EGFR mutations have better prognosis. The results may offer a practical approach to select the patients who may benefit from anti-EGFR target therapy.","title":"[Relationship of epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations, clinicopathologic features and prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"22321547"}
