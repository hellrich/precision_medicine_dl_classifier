Lung function changes and blood gas parameters were examined. The method resulted in an improved FEV1 (P less than 0.025) and in blood gas improvements such as pO2, base excess (P less than 0.001) and oxygen saturation (P less than 0.001). Endobronchial percussion offers the advantage of being largely independent of patient cooperation in chronic obstructive lung disease such as cystic fibrosis. The decision in favour of long-term treatment depends in each case on the individual acceptance by the patient.","title":"[Intrapulmonary percussion in cystic fibrosis].","pubmedId":"3458584"}
