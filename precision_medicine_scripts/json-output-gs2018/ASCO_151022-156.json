HER2-mutant lung cancers impart a distinct natural history with a median overall survival from stage IV diagnosis of 1.6 years (Kris JAMA 2014). While case reports and series have shown activity of HER2-targeted agents in these patients, little is known about outcomes of systemic treatments.  Methods:   Patients with stage IV HER2-mutant lung cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering were reviewed. Patient demographics, types of HER2 mutations, survival, and duration of systemic treatments were documented.   Results:    37 patients with HER2-mutant lung cancers were identified: median age 62; majority were women (n \u003d 24), never smokers (n \u003d 21), and had adenocarcinomas (n \u003d 36, 1 adenosquamous). A 12bp in-frame insertion in exon 20 (p.A775_G776insYVMA c.2324_2325ins12) was present in 23 (62%, 95% CI 45-78%) patients. In addition, there were four 9bp insertions, one 6bp insertion, and five 3bp insertions in exon 20, and four single base pair substitutions (3 exon 20, 1 exon 8). The median overall survival from date of diagnosis of stage IV disease was 2.3 years (95% CI 1.2-2.7). The median duration of all chemotherapy was 8 months (range 0.8-43 months). Median duration of treatment was 6 months for pemetrexed platinum/bevacizumab, 3 months for taxane platinum/bevacizumab, 4 months for gemcitabine, 4 months for vinorelbine, 5 months for mitomycin vinblastine. The median duration of targeted therapy was 3 months for trastuzumab, 4 months for small molecule HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 3 months for erlotinib. No objective responses were noted with trastuzumab (n \u003d 2) or lapatinib (n \u003d 4) alone.  Conclusions:   Most HER2-mutant lung tumors demonstrate an identical 12bp in-frame insertion (YVMA) in exon 20. In our cohort, the median duration of treatment with chemotherapy was double that of HER2-targeted therapies. Pemetrexed-containing regimens had the longest duration of treatment. As we search for better targeted therapies for patients with HER2-mutant lung cancers, chemotherapy remains an important component of care.","title":"Outcomes with chemotherapies and molecular characteristics of HER2-mutant lung cancers.","pubmedId":"ASCO_151022-156"}
