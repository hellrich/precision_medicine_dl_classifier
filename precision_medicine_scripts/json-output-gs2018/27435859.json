We identified eligible studies from several databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from January 1995 to July 2015). Ten studies of 1661 pediatric patients with AML were included in exploring the relationship between the FLT3-ITD and overall survival (OS)/event free survival (EFS). Pediatric patients with AML with FLT3-ITD had worse OS [HR \u003d 2.19 (1.60-3.01)]/EFS [HR \u003d 1.70 (1.37-2.11)] than those patients without FLT3-ITD. Furthermore, FLT3-ITD had unfavorable effect on OS/EFS in the subgroups of NOS, uni/multivariate model, number of patients, the length of following-up, and patient source. The findings of this meta-analysis indicated that FLT3-ITD had negative impact on pediatric patients with AML.
