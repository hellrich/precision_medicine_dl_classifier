Furthermore, the p53 gene elicited important morphological changes in these cell lines. p53-Transfected cells displayed a flat morphology, a large cell body, and a stellate shape with long processes, characteristic of differentiated astrocytes. In addition, the growth inhibitory effect of p53 was found not to be due to induction of apoptosis. These results indicate that p53 plays a tumour suppressor role in low grade and high grade human astrocytomas and raise the possibility of the involvement of p53 in glioma cell differentiation in vitro.","title":"Human wild type p53 inhibits cell proliferation and elicits dramatic morphological changes in human glioma cell lines in vitro.","pubmedId":"7707071"}
