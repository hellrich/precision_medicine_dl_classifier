Autophagy protein 5 silencing diminished the antiproliferative effects of sunitinib and sorafenib by 44% (P \u003c .05) and 41% (P \u003c .05), respectively, in medullary thyroid cancer-1.1 cells and by 43% (P \u003c .01) and 39% (P \u003c .05), respectively, in TT cells. In contrast, everolimus increased the antiproliferative effects of sunitinib and sorafenib by 24% (P \u003c .01) and 27% (P \u003c .01), respectively, in medullary thyroid cancer-1.1 cells and by 20% (P \u003c .05) and 23% (P \u003c .05), respectively, in TT cells. Trehalose increased the antiproliferative effects of sunitinib and sorafenib by 26% (P \u003c .01) and 27% (P \u003c .01), respectively, in medullary thyroid cancer-1.1 cells and by 28% (P \u003c .05) and 29% (P \u003c .05), respectively, in TT cells. Autophagy protein 5 silencing abrogated both everolimus- and trehalose-induced increases in tyrosine kinase inhibitor efficacy.\nLoss (gain) of autophagy diminishes (improves) the efficacy of sunitinib and sorafenib. Our findings suggest that autophagic activation should be combined with targeted ret protooncogene therapy for patients with advanced medullary thyroid cancer.","title":"Autophagic activation potentiates the antiproliferative effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in medullary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"23158184"}
