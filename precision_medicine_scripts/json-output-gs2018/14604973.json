Here, we analyzed the biologic and clinical significance of the FLT3 transcript level in comparison with several gene alterations in 181 de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. The mean expression level in AML was higher than that in normal mononuclear cells, whereas the range varied widely. A high level of FLT3 is related to internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD), the mutations within the activation loop of FLT3 (FLT3/D835Mt), and tandem duplication of the MLL gene (MLL-TD) but not to p53 or N-RAS gene mutations. Furthermore, a high expression level in AML cases with FLT3 mutations was not related to MLL-TD. Overexpressed FLT3 revealed autophosphorylation and had the same sensitivity to the FLT3 inhibitor as FLT3/ITD. Overexpression of FLT3 (more than 200,000 copies/microgRNA) was an unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in 91 AML cases without FLT3/ITD. These results indicated that FLT3 overexpression may distinguish a novel disease entity in AML without FLT3 mutations and serve as a therapeutic target for FLT3 inhibitors.","title":"Biologic and clinical significance of the FLT3 transcript level in acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"14604973"}
