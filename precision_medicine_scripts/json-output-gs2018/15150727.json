A study was designed to determine the pharmacokinetic profile and variability of porfimer sodium in dogs and cats with spontaneous tumors and to thereby determine the optimal timing of its photoactivation in these species. The results of this study indicate that there is marked variability among species in the distribution of porfimer sodium between highly proliferating tissues, which requires careful attention in the design of human and veterinary application of photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium, as determined in rodent models.","title":"Evaluation of porfimer sodium in dogs and cats with spontaneous tumors.","pubmedId":"15150727"}
