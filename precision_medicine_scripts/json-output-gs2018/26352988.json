We present 2 clinically aggressive cases of primary meningeal pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma that clinically mimicked meningioma. One case presented in the posterior fossa of a 56-year-old woman; the other centered on the left operculum of a 35-year-old woman. These cases showed many of the classic features of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, except that xanthomatous cells were rare and eosinophilic granular bodies were inconspicuous. Both cases exhibited high proliferative indices and superficially invaded the brain. One case harboring a BRAF mutation disseminated to the thecal sac and showed a clinical response to the targeted BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. These cases seem to represent an unusual primarily extra-axial presentation of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and may account for at least some of the previously reported cases of primary meningeal glioma and/or glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive meningioma variants. We suggest that BRAF mutation analysis be considered in all meningeal lesions showing atypical histologic or immunohistochemical profiles, particularly those exhibiting glial differentiation, as a diagnostic aid and possible indication for targeted therapy.
