This study evaluated the influence of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition (single-dose rifampicin) and simultaneous cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)/P-gp induction (multiple-dose rifampicin) on lenvatinib pharmacokinetics.\nThis Phase I, single-centre, single-dose (lenvatinib mesylate 24 mg), open-label, sequential study enrolled 15 healthy volunteers. Three regimens were administered over three periods: Period (P) 1 (Days 1-8), P2 (Days 15-22) and P3 (Days 29-50), with a 14-day (first dose) and 28-day (second dose) washout period after lenvatinib mesylate administration (Day 1, Day 15 and Day 43). In P2, a single oral dose of rifampicin (600 mg) was coadministered with lenvatinib. In P3, rifampicin was administered daily (600 mg) for 21 days (Days 29-49). Serial blood samples were collected, and plasma concentrations of total (protein bound + unbound) and free (unbound) lenvatinib and total metabolites (M1, M2, M3 and M5) were measured by validated high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.\nSingle-dose rifampicin (P-gp inhibition) increased area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) of free and total lenvatinib by 32 and 31 %, respectively. Multiple-dose rifampicin (simultaneous P-gp and CYP3A4 induction) decreased lenvatinib AUC0-∞ (total: 18 %; free: 9 %). Treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate and occurred in 7 subjects (47 %).\nLenvatinib exposure was increased by P-gp inhibition; however, based on free concentrations, simultaneous P-gp and CYP3A4 induction results met the prespecified bioequivalence 90 % confidence interval. Overall, the magnitude of these changes was relatively small, and likely not clinically meaningful.","title":"Effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib in healthy adults.","pubmedId":"25022720"}
