We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features, immunophenotypes, Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), and outcomes of 184 consecutive newly diagnosed APL patients treated by intravenous ATO-based therapy. The median age was 40 years (14-77 years). The early death rate was 4.9% (9/184 patients). With a median follow-up time of 36 months (9-74 months), the 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were 93.3% and 92.2%, respectively. Interestingly, there was no meaningful association between 3-year RFS and initial white blood cell count, FLT3-ITD status, or type of PML-RARA isoforms. In multivariable analysis, the CD56 expression was the only independent risk factor in terms of RFS (hazard ratio, 4.70; P\u003d0.005). These results suggested that ATO-based therapy may ameliorate the unfavorable influence of previously known high-risk features; moreover, CD56 expression remains to be a potentially unfavorable prognostic factor in APL patients.
