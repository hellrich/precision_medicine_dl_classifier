The role of the c-Myc protein in LTAg-induced DNA synthesis was studied in microinjection experiments. Expression of LTAg induced cellular DNA synthesis in \u003e 95% of microinjected serum-starved L1 cells, whereas the mutant LTAg-K1 could not induce DNA synthesis. Coexpression of dominant negative c-Myc or Max mutants with LTAg inhibited DNA synthesis, indicating that functional c-Myc is necessary for induction of DNA synthesis by LTAg. Expression of c-Myc induced programmed cell death (apoptosis) in serum-starved L1 cells. Coexpression of c-Myc with LTAg-K1 restored induction of DNA synthesis without apoptosis. Expression of a truncated LTAg, LTAg-(1-259), defective in binding of the tumor suppressor gene product p53, failed to prevent c-Myc-induced apoptosis. The data indicate that c-Myc can restore the ability of LTAg-K1 to induce DNA synthesis and that LTAg-K1 prevents c-Myc-induced apoptosis in serum-starved L1 cells by its interaction with p53.","title":"Role of c-myc in simian virus 40 large tumor antigen-induced DNA synthesis in quiescent 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts.","pubmedId":"7937965"}
