The presence of this mutation has been recognized as an independent poor prognostic factor. In this study, we compared the FLT3 mutational status between diagnosis and subsequent relapses in 31 patients with AML. At diagnosis, seven patients were identified to contain FLT3-ITD mutations and one patient to harbor the D835 mutation. Five patients remained FLT3-ITD positive throughout the disease course (+/+). Three patients lost the FLT3 gene mutation at first (one FLT3-ITD, one D835 mutation), or second relapse (one FLT3-ITD) (+/-). One additional patient lost a small FLT3-ITD positive clone at relapse and at the same time gained an apparently unrelated FLT3-ITD positive clone. One patient without FLT3 mutation at diagnosis relapsed with an FLT3-ITD mutation (-/+). A shorter median duration of first remission (6 months versus 11.5 months) and a higher relapse rate after salvage therapy (e.g. allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation) resulted in a lower leukemia-free survival in the FLT3 mutated group (11% versus 31%). The loss of a clone with a mutation in the FLT3 gene at relapse did not improve the prognosis.","title":"Evolution of FLT3-ITD and D835 activating point mutations in relapsing acute myeloid leukemia and response to salvage therapy.","pubmedId":"15289019"}
