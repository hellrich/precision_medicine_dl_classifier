Ongoing efforts in the laboratory include soft agar assays and mouse xenografts to determine whether knockout of ARID2 via CRISPR technology can transform immortalized primary melanocytes.We are also investigating the larger SWI/SNF dependency of these mutant cell lines.By studyingARID2inactivation in melanoma, we ultimately seek to pinpoint targetable vulnerabilities ofARID2-mutant cells from many cancer types.","title":"Functional characterization of ARID2 in melanoma and melanocytes","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3431"}
