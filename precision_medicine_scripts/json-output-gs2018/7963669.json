TP53 gene mutations are the most frequent genetic event found in human cancers. Most mutations locate in the highly conserved domains of the gene. Their localizations vary according to the tissue and tumor type, but define some hot spot regions that may have a certain degree of tissue specificity. In certain cases, the type of nucleotide substitutions observed can help to find the carcinogenic agent. In recent years, TP53 gene mutations have been frequently observed in human skin tumors. In epithelial carcinomas, they involve mainly exons 5, 7, and 8. Interestingly, many are C to T transitions at dipyrimidine sites; particularly, one can find CC to TT double-base changes that are known to be specific to ultraviolet radiation. These data confirm at the molecular level the role of ultraviolet radiation as an important etiologic factor in the genesis of these lesions. The high incidence of TP53 mutations suggest that they play a role in keratinocyte transformation. Nevertheless, this event has not yet been defined as an early or late event. In melanomas, most studies have shown the detection of the p53 protein by immunohistochemistry, suggestive of the presence of a mutation in the gene prolonging the protein half-life. Anti-p53 reactivity is frequent in these tumors and seems to correlate with tumor aggressiveness. Confirmation and characterization of TP53 gene mutation at the DNA level would help to precisely define the role of this gene in the development of these tumors.","title":"TP53 tumor suppressor gene and skin carcinogenesis.","pubmedId":"7963669"}
