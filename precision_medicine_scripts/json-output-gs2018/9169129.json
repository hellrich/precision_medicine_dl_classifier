Clone 22911 (T74973), encoding a SPYGQ-rich region in its 5\u0027 end, and several other clones that overlapped 22911 were selected. The combined data made it possible to assemble a full-length cDNA sequence. This cDNA sequence is 1677 bp, containing an initiation codon ATG, an open reading frame of 400 amino acids, a poly(A) signal, and a poly(A) tail. We found 100% identity between the 5\u0027 part of the consensus sequence and the 598-bp-long sequence named TFG. The TFG sequence is fused to the 3\u0027 end of NTRK1, generating the TRK-T3 fusion transcript found in papillary thyroid carcinoma. The cDNA therefore represents the full-length transcript of the TFG gene. TFG was localized to 3q11-q12 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The 3\u0027 and the 5\u0027 ends of the TFG cDNA probe hybridized to a 2.2-kb band on Northern blot filters in all tissues examined.","title":"Characterization and chromosomal mapping of the human TFG gene involved in thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"9169129"}
