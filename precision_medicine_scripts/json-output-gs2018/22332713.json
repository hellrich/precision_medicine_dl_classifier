Specimens were evaluated with a massively parallel pyrosequencing method (454) to resolve discordances between polymerase chain reaction and Sanger results. Reproducibility of the cobas test was assessed at 3 sites by using 3 reagent lots and an 8-member panel of melanoma samples.\nA valid cobas result was obtained for all eligible patients. Sanger sequencing had a failure rate of 9.2% (44 of 477). For the remaining 433 specimens, positive percent agreement was 96.4% (215 of 223) and negative percent agreement, 80% (168 of 210). Among 42 cobas mutation-positive/Sanger V600E-negative specimens, 17 were V600E positive and 24 were V600K positive by 454. The cobas test detected 70% of V600K mutations. In the reproducibility study, a correct interpretation was made for 100% of wild-type specimens and specimens with greater than 5% mutant alleles; V600E mutations were detected in 90% of specimens with less than 5% mutant alleles.\nThe cobas test (1) had a lower assay failure rate than that of Sanger, (2) was more sensitive in detecting V600E mutations, (3) detected most V600K mutations, and (4) was highly reproducible.","title":"Multisite analytic performance studies of a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of BRAF V600E mutations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"22332713"}
