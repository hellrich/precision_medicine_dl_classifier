The mean age of patients was 61.8 years; 16.9% were aged 70 years or over. Of the 479,237 patients had stage I disease, 108 patients stage II disease, and 134 patients stage III. Lobectomy was performed in 280 patients, pneumonectomy in 191, and wedge resection in 8. Operative mortality was 5% overall, 6.8% following pneumonectomy and 3.9% following lobectomy. There was no operative mortality following wedge resection. Old age did not affect operative mortality. Overall actuarial survival was 76.2% and 39.8% at 1 year and 5 years postoperatively, respectively (stage I: 86% and 55%; stage II: 77.8% and 35.5%; stage III: 57.5% and 16.2%). There were statistically significant differences in survival between the stages. Five-year actuarial survival was 45% for squamous cell carcinoma, 36.3% for adenocarcinoma, 31.9% for dimorphic carcinoma and a 21% for undifferentiated carcinoma. There were statistically significant differences in survival between undifferentiated carcinoma and each of the other cell types. The favourable survival in stage I disease lends weight to the concept that there is hope for cure in patients with early non small cell lung cancer.","title":"Survival and prognosis following resection of primary non small cell bronchogenic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"1851020"}
