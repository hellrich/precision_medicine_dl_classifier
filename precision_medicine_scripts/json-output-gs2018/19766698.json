Several types of rearrangement known to occur in thyroid cancer, including RET/PTC, NTRK1 and BRAF/AKAP9, are more common in radiation-associated thyroid tumors and RET/PTC can be induced experimentally by exposing human thyroid cells to ionizing radiation. In this review, the molecular mechanisms of generation of RET/PTC and other chromosomal rearrangements are discussed, with the emphasis on the role of nuclear architecture and interphase gene proximity in the generation of intrachromosomal rearrangements in thyroid cells.","title":"Mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangements in solid tumors: the model of papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"19766698"}
