Patients were also studied for NPM1, FLT3, MLL, and CEBPA mutations. The median follow-up for survival was 6.3 years.\nIDH mutations were found in 129 patients (16.0%) -IDH1 in 61 patients (7.6%), and IDH2 in 70 patients (8.7%). Two patients had both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. All but one IDH1 mutation caused substitutions of residue R132; IDH2 mutations caused changes of R140 (n \u003d 48) or R172 (n \u003d 22). IDH mutations were associated with older age (P \u003c .001; effect conferred by IDH2 only); lower WBC (P \u003d .04); higher platelets (P \u003c .001); cytogenetically normal (CN) -AML (P\u003c .001); and NPM1 mutations, in particular with the genotype of mutated NPM1 without FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; P \u003c .001). In patients with CN-AML with the latter genotype, IDH mutations adversely impacted relapse-free survival (RFS; P \u003d .02) and overall survival (P \u003d .03), whereas outcome was not affected in patients with CN-AML who lacked this genotype. In CN-AML, multivariable analyses revealed a significant interaction between IDH mutation and the genotype of mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (ie, the adverse impact of IDH mutation [RFS]; P \u003d .046 was restricted to this patient subset).\nIDH1 and IDH2 mutations are recurring genetic changes in AML. They constitute a poor prognostic factor in CN-AML with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD, which allows refined risk stratification of this AML subset.","title":"IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are frequent genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia and confer adverse prognosis in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia with NPM1 mutation without FLT3 internal tandem duplication.","pubmedId":"20567020"}
