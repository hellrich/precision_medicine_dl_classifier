Here, we show that BRAF depletion by siRNA or inhibition of its activity by treatment with BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 decreases migration and invasion in thyroid cancer cells expressing oncogenic (V600E)BRAF through a MEK/ERK-dependent mechanism, since treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 exerts the same effect. Moreover, over-expression of (V600E)BRAF increases migration and invasion of wild-type BRAF thyroid cells. Using the same strategies, we demonstrate that these effects are mediated by upregulation of the transcriptional repressor Snail with a concomitant decrease of its target E-cadherin, both hallmarks of EMT. These results reveal a novel (V600E)BRAF-induced mechanism in thyroid tumours progression and provides a rationale for using the PLX4720 inhibitor to target (V600E)BRAF signalling to effectively control progression of thyroid cancer.","title":"(V600E)BRAF promotes invasiveness of thyroid cancer cells by decreasing E-cadherin expression through a Snail-dependent mechanism.","pubmedId":"23435375"}
