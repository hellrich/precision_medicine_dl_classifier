We investigated whether a cyclin D kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, PD 0332991, could reverse EGFR-TKI resistance in human lung cancer cells and explored the underlying mechanisms. We found that PD 0332991 potentiated gefitinib-induced growth inhibition in both EGFR-TKI-sensitive (PC-9) and EGFR-TKI-resistant (PC-9/AB2) cells by down-regulating proliferation and inducing apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Tumor xenografts were then used to verify the effects of PD 0332991 in vivo. Mice treated with a combination of PD 0332991 and gefitinib had the fastest tumor regression and delayed relapse. Tumors from mice receiving the combination treatment exhibited down-regulated proliferation, up-regulated apoptosis, and less angiogenesis. Finally, lung adenocarcinoma patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs were given an exploratory treatment of PD 0332991. One patient with gefitinib resistance exhibited clinical remission after treatment with PD 0332991. These findings suggest PD 0332991 reverses acquired EGFR-TKI-resistance in NSCLC cells, and may provide a novel treatment strategy for NSLSC patients with EGFR-TKI resistance.","title":"PD 0332991, a selective cyclin D kinase 4/6 inhibitor, sensitizes lung cancer cells to treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","pubmedId":"27825114"}
