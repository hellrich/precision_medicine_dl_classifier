T-cell lines and clones have been developed with specific cytotoxicity and/or proliferative responses for autologous melanoma targets but not for allogeneic melanoma tumor cells, autologous normal cells or natural killer (NK)-sensitive targets. The concentration of rIL2 is critical for the generation of autologous tumor-specific T-cell lines, with low rIL2 concentrations (up to 800 IU/ml) facilitating the growth of T-cell lines with tumor-specific activity. The alpha beta T-cell receptor (TCR) and the CD3 antigen are involved in specific cytotoxicity and/or proliferative responses of these T-cell lines and clones. An oligoclonal pattern of beta-chain TCR gene rearrangements was observed on T-cell lines and clones with autologous tumor-specific cytotoxicity, suggesting that they are comprised of T cells that have undergone a clonal expansion in response to particular antigen. Autologous tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells are HLA-restricted and recognize on the melanoma tumor cells HLA Class I or possibly Class II antigens plus a tumor-specific determinant. TIL from patients with metastatic melanoma have unique characteristics in comparison with PBL and lymph node lymphocytes and they appear to contain substantial proportions of T cells that have been locally sensitized to autologous tumor cells. Single stimulation of TIL with autologous tumor cells in the presence of rIL2 is sufficient for the generation of T cell lines with autologous tumor-specific activity, whereas, multiple stimulation of PBL and lymph node lymphocytes was required to achieve the same purpose. TIL-derived T cell lines have been expanded in rIL2 in vitro by at least 1,500-fold without losing their activity. Approximately, 40% of the patients exhibited complete or partial responses to adoptive immunotherapy with melanoma TIL and rIL2.","title":"Human autologous tumor-specific T cells in malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"1873855"}
