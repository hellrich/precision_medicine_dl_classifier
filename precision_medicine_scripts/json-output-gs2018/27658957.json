Here we describe a patient with clinical signs of BCNS, caused by postzygotic mosaicism of a PTCH1 gene mutation. We performed Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis and Droplet Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction to determine the degree of mosaicism in different tissues of this patient. Our case shows that a relatively low-grade mosaicism can lead to clinical signs reminiscent of those caused by a germline mutation. This finding has important implications for genetic counselling and therefore is pivotal to recognize for dermatologists as well as for clinical geneticists and clinical laboratory geneticists.
