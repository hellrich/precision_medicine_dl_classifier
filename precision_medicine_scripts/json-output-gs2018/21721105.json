Currently no effective conventional systemic therapies exist to treat pediatric MTC. We describe an adolescent female with newly diagnosed MEN2B syndrome who presented with advanced stage metastatic MTC and demonstrated a partial transient response to sorafenib monotherapy. This clinical result supports further research into the use of sorafenib in the treatment of pediatric MTC.","title":"Transient partial response to sorafenib treatment in an adolescent patient with MEN2B syndrome and end-stage medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"21721105"}
