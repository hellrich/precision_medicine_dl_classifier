In addition, she had disseminated telangiectatic macules on both thighs. Intensive rubbing of lesions resulted in wheals. Biopsy revealed increased numbers of mast cells. We diagnosed telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans, a rare clinical form of adult maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, a group which also includes urticaria pigmentosa. No evidence was found for systemic involvement. Possible associations with malignant tumors and the possible role of c-kit mutations both in development of melanoma and mastocytosis are discussed.","title":"Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans, a form of cutaneous mastocytosis, associated with malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"19054427"}
