The expression of Aurora-A kinase (henceforth referred to as Aurora-A) in T-cell lymphomas is not well characterized. In this study, we assessed Aurora-A expression by immunohistochemical analysis in 100 lymphomas encompassing a variety of T-cell lymphomas as categorized in the World Health Organization classification. Aurora-A expression was highest in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas and variably expressed in other types of T-cell lymphomas. In addition, the pattern of Aurora-A expression was predominantly cytoplasmic in ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and was nuclear in ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and other T-cell lymphomas, suggesting altered biochemical mechanisms of Aurora-A nuclear transport in ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that Aurora-A is more highly expressed in ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma than in ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and is relatively lower in peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Using western blot analysis and the DEL cell line (derived from ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma), we showed that Aurora-A expression is decreased after treatment with either MYC or MEK inhibitors, consistent with the MYC and MAP kinase signaling pathways being involved in driving Aurora-A expression; the greatest decrease was observed after MYC inhibition. These findings provide insights into the possible importance of Aurora-A overexpression in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma pathogenesis, and also suggest that Aurora-A inhibition could be a potential therapeutic approach for patients with anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.","title":"Differential expression of aurora-A kinase in T-cell lymphomas.","pubmedId":"23411487"}
