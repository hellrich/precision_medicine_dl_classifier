Schizoid and psychastenic types dominated in the premorbid structure of personality. The following variants of the initial stage were singled out: affective, psychopathic-like, with overvalued disorders, neurotic-like, with the predomination of simplex-syndrome, clinically polymorphic. Manifesting schizophrenic attacks in female adolescents were determined by affective-delusive, hallucinatory-delusive, oneiroid-catatonic and polymorphic syndromes. The attack-like course was found in most of cases. The typological similarity of psychotic states studied with those of adult schizophrenic patients was noted.","title":"[Manifesting schizophrenic attacks in female adolescents].","pubmedId":"21716246"}
