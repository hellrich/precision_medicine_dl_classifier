An effective treatment that increases patient survival would represent a significant advance in the field, and provide a desperately needed new therapy for this deadly disease. Herein we disclose the identification of the target of the tumor homing peptide which, when conjugated to nanoworms, deliver and carry the pro-apoptotic nanoparticle system selectively to the tumor target tissue. This nanosystem has shown unprecedented anti-cancer activity in highly drug resistant/refractory mouse models of glioblastoma, which closely mimic the human disease and thus provide an exciting new opportunity for the treatment of GBM. Plans for further development of this Nanosystem will also be discussed.","title":"Targeted nanoparticle based therapy for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme: Unprecedented anti-cancer activity in highly drug resistant/refractory mouse models of glioblastoma with novel apoptotic nanoparticles which hone to a cell-surface protein f","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-5415"}
