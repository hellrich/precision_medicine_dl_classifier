Computed tomography scan and upper GI series showed typical findings of intussusception. Laparoscopic-assisted small bowel resection was carried out. Histologic diagnosis revealed malignant melanoma. The patient had a history of right maxillary sinus melanoma greater than 12 years before presentation. We report the first case of a jejunojejunal intussusception caused by metastatic sinonasal melanoma, and its subsequent laparoscopic-assisted resection.","title":"Laparoscopic resection of metastatic mucosal melanoma causing jejunal intussusception.","pubmedId":"20393324"}
