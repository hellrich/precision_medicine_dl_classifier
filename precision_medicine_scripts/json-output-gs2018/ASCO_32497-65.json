{"publicationTypes":["2009 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: To investigate the efficacy and safety of hepatic intra-arterial infusion of cisplatin, fotemustine combined with systemic dacarbazine for the treatment of melanoma patients with liver metastasis. Methods: From 2005.7 to 2008.7, thirty-six melanoma patients with liver metastatic were enrolled. Systemic dacarbazine (250mg/m2 d1-5) and intra-arterial hepatic (i.a.h.) of cisplatin (75mg/m2 d6) and fotemustine (100mg/m2 d7) were given repeated for 4-weeks. Response, progress free survival(PFS), and toxicity were analyzed. Results: 27 of the 36 patients were evaluable, with mean cycle 2.161.19, one achieved CR, one PR and seven SD. The disease control rate was 33.3% (9/27) with a median PFS of 3.5 months (95% CI 3.45-7.02months), overall survival of 7.5 months (95 CI 6.87-11.06 months, following to 2008.8). The Grade 3/4 toxicity was mainly myelosuppression, with occurrence rates of 40.7% (10/27). Conclusions: Intra-arterial hepatic chemotherapy show its efficacy and may prolong PFS in melanoma patients with liver metastasis.","title":"Intra-arterial hepatic bio-chemotherapy for the treatment of melanoma patients with liver metastasis: A phase II clinical study.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32497-65"}
