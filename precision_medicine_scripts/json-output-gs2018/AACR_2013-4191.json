In this study, we evaluated the expression and function of miR-20a in thyroid cancer tissue and cell lines in vitro and in vivo. We found miR-20a was significantly downregulated in undifferentiated and aggressive thyroid cancer (p\u003c0.05). Ectopic overexpression of miR-20a significantly inhibited thyroid cancer cell proliferation in vitro (p \u003c 0.01) and in vivo (p \u003c 0.01), tumor spheroid formation (p \u003c 0.05), and invasion (p \u003c 0.05) in multiple thyroid cancer cell lines. We performed integrated transcriptome analysis with and without miR-20a overexpression and target prediction analysis, and identified LIMK1 as a target of miR-20a. Luciferase assay demonstrated that LIMK1 was a direct target of miR-20a and that direct knockdown of LIMK1 recapitulated the effects of miR-20a in multiple thyroid cancer lines. Our findings suggest that miR-20a has a tumor suppressive function in thyroid cancer which is mediated through LIMK1 and that loss of miR-20a expression may be involved in thyroid cancer progression.","title":"MiR-20a inhibits thyroid cancer cell growth and invasion through LIMK1.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-4191"}
