And their features were analyzed.\nMutant IDH1 was detected in 111 (67.3%) tumors including 109 (98.2%) CGT→CAT mutations, 1 (0.9%) CGT→AGT mutation and 1 (0.9%) CGT→TGT mutation. The frequencies of IDH mutation in AO, O and OA were 13/15, 83.3% and 72.9% respectively. They were significantly higher than that in AOA (27.0%, P \u003c 0.001).\nThe different frequencies of IDH1 mutation in different subsets of oligodendroglial tumors may imply varied tumorigenic pathways between subsets.","title":"[Feature analysis of IDH1 mutation in oligodendroglial tumors].","pubmedId":"22781348"}
