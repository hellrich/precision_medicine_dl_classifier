Immunohistochemical study of nm23 and c-erbB-2 expression was performed on 64 primary tumours, 19 metastases in the lymph nodes and 37 liver metastases. More pronounced expression of these proteins in the primary tumour cells is observed in cases with liver metastases. Expression of nm 23 was observed in 66% and that of c-erbB2 in 59% of liver metastases. Thus, expression of these proteins may reflect biological behaviour of the tumour and may appear to be an important factor in development of colorectal cancer metastases.","title":"[Expression of nm23 and c-erbB-2 proteins in cells of primary colorectal cancer and its metastases].","pubmedId":"14664140"}
