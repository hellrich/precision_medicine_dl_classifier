In recent years, advances in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of melanoma and the discovery of new drugs has resulted in significant progress in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma patients. The development of resistance to these drugs, however, remains a challenge. One way how to avoid resistance, or at least delay it, is to administer combination therapy.\nThis case study demonstrates that combination therapy with a BRAF and a MEK inhibitor can be used to successfully treat metastatic malignant melanoma patients and suggests they should be employed in therapeutic algorithms for patients with metastatic malignant melanoma and BRAF gene mutations.","title":"[The Role of BRAF/MEK Inhibition in Metastatic Malignant Melanoma - a Case Study].","pubmedId":"27081804"}
