TEL/AML1 was not found in any samples from the patients with T-ALL, B-ALL, or CD10-negative B-precursor ALL. Among patients with CD10-positive B-precursor ALL, age, initial white blood cell count, and immunophenotype did not differ with TEL/AML1 positivity, although the patients were predominantly male (p \u003c 0.01). Clinical outcomes of 94 patients treated with recent protocols were analyzed. Five of the 21 (23.8%) patients with TEL/AML1 relapsed and 4 of these relapsed \u003e 24 months after diagnosis. Although the overall 5-year survival rate was better among patients with TEL/AML1 fusion transcript than among those without it (87.3 +/- 8.7% versus 75.9 +/- 5.8%, respectively), the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates of patients with TEL/AML1 fusion transcript and those without it were similar (64.0 +/- 13.5% versus 69.1 +/- 6.3%, respectively). However, for 57 patients treated with the latest intensive protocol, the 4-year DFS rate was much higher for the patients with TEL/AML1 fusion transcript than for those without it (100.0% v.s. 69.6 +/- 8.4%, respectively, p \u003d 0.1472).\nThis study confirmed that TEL/AML1 gene fusion is the most common genetic event in pediatric ALL in Japan and is restricted to CD10-positive B-precursor ALL. Moreover, it was associated with an improved survival rate among patients treated with intensive therapy. Therefore, these data suggest that the patients with TEL/AML1 may not necessarily be candidates for less aggressive treatment.","title":"Prognostic significance of TEL/AML1 fusion transcript in childhood B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","pubmedId":"9628428"}
