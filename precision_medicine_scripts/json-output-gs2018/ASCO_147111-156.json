We queried whether the genomic alterations (GA) identified by comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in refractory and metastatic SAC could lead to potential targeted therapy selection.  Methods:    DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections from 92 clinically advanced SAC. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 682X for 3,230 exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. The results were evaluated from each sample for all classes of genomic alterations.  Results:    There were 2 grade 1, 27 grade 2 and 63 grade 3 relapsed/refractory SAC in 30 (33%) female and 62 (67%) male patients with a median age of 59.6 years (range 25 to 84 years). There were 27 Stage III and 65 Stage IV cases. The majority (88%) of SAC harbored at least 1 clinically relevant alteration (mean 1.9 per patient) with a mean of 3.7 GA per tumor. GA occurred in 49 different genes including: PIK3CA (25%); HRAS (20%); CDKN2A (17%); ERBB2 (15%); and PTEN and NF1 (9%), NOTCH1 and MCL1 (8%), EGFR (5%), KRAS (4%) and RICTOR, HGF, FBXW7 and CDK4 (3%). The greater frequency of ERBB2 alterations (15%) observed in SAC was significantly higher than observed in 110 similarly studied specialized salivary carcinomas including acinic cell, adenoid cystic and mucoepidermoid carcinomas (1%)  (p \u003d 0.0001). A similar increase in HRAS alterations of 18/92 (20%) SAC vs 4/110 (4%) in the specialized tumor group was also observed (p \u003d 0.008). PIK3CAwas altered in 25% of SAC vs. 5% in 110 specialized tumors (p \u003d 0.001).   Conclusions:    SAC are a clinically aggressive and pathologically distinctive subset of salivary gland carcinomas. These tumors also differ significantly from the specialized salivary gland tumors in their genomic landscape. The high frequency of clinically relevant alterations in SAC including the 15% ERBB2 alteration frequency suggests that continued molecular analysis of this tumor type has the potential to lead patients to clinical trials employing both established and novel targeted therapies.","title":"Comprehensive genomic profiling of salivary gland adenocarcinomas to reveal frequency of druggable targets.","pubmedId":"ASCO_147111-156"}
