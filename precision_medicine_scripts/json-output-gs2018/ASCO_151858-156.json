Performing detailed genetic profiling to identify the milieu of actionable gene variants characteristic of specific tumors may guide targeted approaches to treatment, as well as uncover new therapeutic targets. To this end, we used a next-generation sequencing approach to identify characteristic actionable variants across various solid tumor types.  Methods:  DNA from FFPE sections of 58 solid tumor samples (15 colon, 14 ovarian, 13 lung, 11 melanoma, and 5 squamous cell carcinoma) was sequenced using the Jackson Laboratory Cancer Treatment Profile, a 358-gene targeted panel and submitted to the Clinical Genomics Analytical (CGA) bioinformatics pipeline. Resultant variant calls were filtered based on impact and actionable variants (defined as those having therapeutic relevance) were identified through extensive literature review from in-house curation efforts.  Results:  Tumor profiling for actionable variants demonstrated genetic heterogeneity among solid tumor types. Colon tumors contained codon 12 or 13 variants in KRAS (47%; 7/15), and RET G691S (33%; 5/15); lung  tumors contained frequent AURKA F31I (31%; 4/13), and KDR Q472H (69% 9/15) variants; melanomas contained BRAF V600  (91%; 10/11) and AURKA F31I (64%; 7/11) variants; squamous cell carcinomas contained frequent FGFR4 G388R (60%; 3/5), with high prevalence of AURKA F31I, RET G691S, and PIK3CA E542K (each 40%; 2/5). KRAS variants were identified in 80% (4/5) of mucinous ovarian tumor samples. Mucinous ovarian tumors were also associated with MET T1010I (29%; 2/5), which was not identified in any other analyzed tumor type.  Conclusions:  Somatic variant profiling in solid tumors is biologically heterogeneous but often results in clinically actionable genomic characteristics. In this survey of 5 different tumor types, we identified various genetic variants including a frequent occurrence of MET T1010I in mucinous ovarian tumors. MET T1010I is an activating mutation in MET that has been demonstrated to enhance tumor cell proliferation and migration, and represents a potential therapeutic target that has not been previously identified in ovarian cancer.","title":"Solid tumor profiling via next-generation sequencing to identify tumor-specific actionable variants.","pubmedId":"ASCO_151858-156"}
