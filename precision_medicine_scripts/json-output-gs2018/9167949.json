The main tumour type present in all manifestations of this syndrome. MEN-2A, MEN-2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), is medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). MTC arises from the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid. MEN-2A is characterised by the triad of MTC, phaeochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia. MEN-2B is characterised by features similar to those of MEN-2A, except for the absence of clinically apparent parathyroid hyperplasia, and additional stigmata including a marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas and ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract. FMTC families have MTC as their only phenotype. Missense mutations affecting conserved cysteine codons adjacent to the transmembrane domain of the RET proto-oncogene have been identified in the germline DNA of patients with MEN-2A and FMTC. A single mutation at codon 918 in the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET receptor has been associated with the MEN-2B phenotype. In a small number of FMTC families, missense point mutations have also been identified in the intracellular domain of the RET protein. RET mutation analysis of MEN-2 families has allowed the identification of genotype-phenotype correlations. While 25% of all MTCs are hereditary, the great majority of MTCs, 75%, are sporadic. Various somatic RET mutations have been identified in sporadic MTCs. In a small number of hereditary MTCs with germline mutations in RET, an additional somatic missense RET mutation has been identified. The discovery of RET mutations in MEN-2 has made possible accurate DNA-based diagnosis and predictive testing. The clinical significance of somatic RET mutations has yet to be determined.","title":"RET proto-oncogene mutations in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"9167949"}
