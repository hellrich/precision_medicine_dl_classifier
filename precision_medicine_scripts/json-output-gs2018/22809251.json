The median Breslow thickness was 2.6 mm, and the most common site of the primary melanoma was the trunk, followed by the head and neck region. BRAF, NRAS and KIT genomic sequencing was performed successfully in 20, 18 and 14 patients, respectively. Among the 20 melanomas with completed BRAF-sequencing analysis, 6 (30%) harbored a mutation, of which 5 (83%) had a V600E mutation and 1 (17%) had a V600R mutation. None of the melanomas harbored NRAS or KIT mutations.\nAs has been reported in other common types of melanoma, V600 BRAF mutation is the most common mutation of those tested in spindle cell melanoma. NRAS or KIT mutation appears to be rare, if not completely absent.","title":"BRAF, NRAS and KIT sequencing analysis of spindle cell melanoma.","pubmedId":"22809251"}
