In addition, five out of seven cases of AML-MO showed results above the cutoff point.\nThis highly sensitive enhanced chemiluminescent technique may be applied to discriminate between ALL and AML-M7 or AML-MI cases, and most AML-M0 cases. It is very simple, cheap and easy to perform compared to other procedures used to measure MPO activity in AML-leukemias including AML-M7 and AML-M0.","title":"p-Iodophenol-enhanced luminol chemiluminescent assay applied to discrimination between acute lymphoblastic and minimally differentiated acute myeloid (FAB-M0) or acute megakaryoblastic (FAB-M7) leukemias.","pubmedId":"15570291"}
