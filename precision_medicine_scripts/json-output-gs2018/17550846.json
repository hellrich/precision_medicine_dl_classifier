The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between AML and MDS by comparing the frequency of molecular mutations in the two conditions.\nWe compared the frequency of FLT3-length mutations (FLT3-LM), FLT3-TKD, MLL-partial tandem duplications (MLL-PTD), NRAS, and KITD816 in 381 patients with MDS refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB] n\u003d49; with ringed sideroblasts [RARS] n\u003d310; chronic monomyelocytic leukemia [CMML] n\u003d22) and in 4130 patients with AML (de novo: n\u003d3139; secondary AML [s-AML] following MDS: n\u003d397; therapy-related [t-AML]: n\u003d233; relapsed: n\u003d361).\nAll mutations were more frequent in s-AML than in MDS and all but the FLT3-TKD were more frequent in RAEB than in RA/RARS. The higher incidences in s-AML were significant for FLT3-TKD (p\u003d0.032), MLL-PTD (p\u003d0.034), and FLT3-LM (RA/RARS: 0/45; RAEB: 8/293; 2.7%; s-AML: 45/389; 11.6%; p\u003c0.0001). The incidence of NRAS-mutations increased from 17/272 (6.3%) in MDS to 41/343 in s-AML (12.0%) and that of KITD816-mutations from 2/290 (0.7%) to 5/341 (1.5%) (p\u003dn.s.). FLT3-LM-acquisition occurred in 3/22 cases (13.6%) during MDS transformation; NRAS-acquisition occurred in 1/24 (4.2%). FLT3-LM and MLL-PTD were more frequent in AML relapse than in de novo AML or s-AML (p\u003c0.0001).\nThe increase of molecular mutations from low- to high-risk MDS, to s-AML, and to relapsed AML emphasizes the value of these mutations as markers of progressing disease. Finally, we found a low rate of 5q- in the molecularly mutated cases in MDS which might explain the stability of this subtype.","title":"A comparative study of molecular mutations in 381 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and in 4130 patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"17550846"}
