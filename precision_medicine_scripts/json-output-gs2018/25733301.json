PD-L1 immunoexpression was assessed using the murine antihuman PD-L1 monoclonal antibody 5H1. Extent of membranous PD-L1 expression was assigned in each spot. Spots showing ≥5% expression were considered positive. Average PD-L1 expression per tumor was also calculated (5% positivity cutoff). \"High CD8 density\" was defined as the presence of ≥60 CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes per high power field in a given spot. A tumor was considered high density if ≥50% of its spots were of high density.\nPD-L1 expression was positive in approximately 20% of tumors. None of the benign urothelium spots expressed PD-L1. High CD8 density was observed in approximately 20% of cases. CD8 density did not correlate with PD-L1 expression. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were 14% and 28%, respectively (median follow-up, 31.5 months). PD-L1 expression was associated with age at cystectomy (P \u003d .01). Remaining clinicopathologic parameters were not associated with PD-L1 expression or CD8 density. High CD8 density was associated with favorable OS (P \u003d .02) and DSS (P \u003d .02). The same was true when CD8 density was adjusted for demographic and clinicopathologic parameters. There was no correlation between PD-L1 expression and outcome.\nHigh intratumoral CD8+ T cell density is associated with better OS and DSS in invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. We found no correlation between PD-L1 expression and outcome.","title":"Assessment of tumoral PD-L1 expression and intratumoral CD8+ T cells in urothelial carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25733301"}
