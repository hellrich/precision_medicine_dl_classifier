Previous benign thyroid disease is recorded in 52% of all cancers; this was generally goitre or a thyroid nodule, and in few cases hyperthyroidism. Previous disease is observed in 75% of insular, in 68% of follicular, in 51.5% of papillary, in 35% of anaplastic carcinomas. It is supposed that previous thyroid disease is a risk factor in the development of cancer.","title":"[Precedents of benign thyroid pathology in carcinoma of the thyroid].","pubmedId":"7882450"}
