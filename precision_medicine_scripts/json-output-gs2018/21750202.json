In addition, the presence of tumor-escape mechanisms PD-L1/PD-1 pathway, FoxP3 and loss of HLA or melanocyte differentiation antigens, both required for tumor cell recognition and killing, were studied.\nHigher percentages of melanocyte antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells were found in the melanoma tissues as compared with adjacent normal skin and peripheral blood. Functional analysis revealed 2 important findings: (i) in 5 of 17 patients, we found cytokine production after specific peptide stimulation by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), not by autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL); (ii) CD8(+) T cells from 7 of 17 patients did not produce cytokines after specific stimulation, which corresponded with significant loss of tumor HLA-A2 expression. The presence of other tumor-escape mechanisms did not correlate to T-cell function.\nOur data show that functional T-cell responses could be missed when only PBL and not TIL are evaluated, emphasizing the importance of TIL analysis for immunomonitoring. Furthermore, loss of tumor HLA-A2 may explain the lack of T-cell functionality. These findings have important implications for selecting melanoma patients who may benefit from immunotherapy.","title":"T-cell immune function in tumor, skin, and peripheral blood of advanced stage melanoma patients: implications for immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"21750202"}
