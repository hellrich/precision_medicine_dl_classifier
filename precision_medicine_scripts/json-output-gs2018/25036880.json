A total of 855 patients were enrolled in the trials: 568 patients were treated with vemurafenib and 287 patients were treated with dacarbazine.\nAmong the 568 patients treated with vemurafenib, ocular adverse effects developed in 22% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.5-25.6). The most common ocular diagnosis was uveitis (4.0%; 95% CI, 2.6-6.0), followed by conjunctivitis (2.8%; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5) and dry eyes (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7). All were successfully managed while vemurafenib therapy was continued.\nOcular adverse events and symptoms may be seen in more than one-fifth of patients being treated with vemurafenib. However, vemurafenib can be continued while the ocular symptoms are being managed. The pathogenesis of ocular symptoms in this patient population is unclear; additional studies are necessary.","title":"Ocular toxicity in BRAF mutant cutaneous melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib.","pubmedId":"25036880"}
