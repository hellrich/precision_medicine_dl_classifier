We investigated the relationship of NLR with circulating cytokines and molecular alterations.\nWe performed retrospective analyses on multiple cohorts of CRC patients (metastatic untreated (n\u003d166), refractory metastatic (n\u003d161), hepatectomy (n\u003d198), stage 2/3 (n\u003d274), and molecularly screened (n\u003d342)). High NLR (ratio of absolute neutrophil-to-lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood) was defined as NLR\u003e5. Plasma cytokines were evaluated using multiplex-bead assays. Kaplan-Meier estimates, non-parametric correlation analysis, and hierarchical cluster analyses were used.\nHigh NLR was associated with poor prognosis in mCRC (hazard ratio (HR) 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.03-2.89; P\u003d0.039) independent of known prognostic factors and molecular alterations (KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA/CIMP). High NLR correlated with increased expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-2Rα, hepatocyte growth factor, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and vascular epidermal growth factor in exploratory (n\u003d39) and validation (n\u003d166) cohorts. Fourteen additional cytokines correlated with high NLR in the validation cohort. All 20 cytokines fell into three major clusters: inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic cytokines, and epidermal growth factor ligands. In mCRC, composite stratification based on NLR-cytokine score provided enhanced prognostic information (HR 2.09; 95% CI: 1.59-2.76; P\u003c0.001) over and above NLR.\nHigh NLR is an independent poor prognostic marker in CRC and correlates with a distinct cytokine profile related to key biological processes involved in carcinogenesis. A composite NLR-cytokine stratification has enhanced prognostic value in mCRC.","title":"Cytokine profile and prognostic significance of high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"25688736"}
