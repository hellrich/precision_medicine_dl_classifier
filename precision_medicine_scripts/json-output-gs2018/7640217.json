No homozygous p16 gene deletion was found in any case. A missense point mutation of the p16 gene was found in only one patient. This point mutation was absent from the patient\u0027s lymphocytes, ruling out a polymorphism or a germline mutation. These findings suggest that p16 gene alterations are rarely observed in breast carcinoma.","title":"Analysis of p16 gene deletion and point mutation in breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"7640217"}
