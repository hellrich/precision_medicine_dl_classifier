The ADC GV (CDX-011) delivers the potent cytotoxin MMAE to gpNMB+ cells. GV has shown promising activity in advanced melanoma and breast cancer. Methods: This Phase II study (CDX011-05) assessed the efficacy and safety of GV monotherapy (1.9 mg/kg q3w) for patients (pts) with advanced melanoma progressive after 1 chemotherapy, 1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) and if BRAFV600mutated, 1 BRAF/MEK inhibitor. Central IHC determined gpNMB expression in archival and/or pre-treatment tumor. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) (RECIST 1.1) with 6 responders out of 52 evaluable pts as threshold for antitumor activity. Additional endpoints: progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), safety, PK/PD and correlation of tumor gpNMB expression with efficacy. Results: 62 pts enrolled (all evaluable) had median age of 67 years; 55% male; 21% BRAFV600mutated; 63% with 3 lines prior therapy; 100% had prior CPI; 100% Stage IV; 89% M1c. One confirmed complete response (CR) and 6 confirmed partial responses (PR, including 1 unconfirmed CR) were seen (confirmed ORR \u003d 11%, p \u003d 0.035 comparing to reference ORR 5%); 33 pts had stable disease including 3 unconfirmed PR. Median DOR \u003d 6.0 (range: 4.1, 14+) months (mos), median PFS \u003d 4.3 mos and median OS \u003d 9.8 mos; 26 pts continue to be followed for survival. All pts with available tissue (60/60) had gpNMB+ tumors; 47/60 had 100% gpNMB+ epithelial cells; no clear correlation with outcome was seen in this population with consistent high expression. Toxicities included alopecia, neuropathy, rash, fatigue and neutropenia. Treatment-related rash in cycle 1 was associated with improved ORR (rash \u003d 22%; no rash \u003d 7%), PFS (p \u003d 0.007) and OS (p \u003d 0.035). Conclusions: GV has promising activity (primary endpoint of ORR was met) with a manageable safety profile in heavily pre-treated melanoma pts. Additional cohorts evaluating GV with either varlilumab, an activating anti-CD27 monoclonal antibody, or PD-1 inhibitors are open to accrual to provide further insights into the synergy of ADC and immunotherapy.
