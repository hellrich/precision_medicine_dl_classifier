These findings suggest that BRAFV600 mutations are unlikely to occur as homozygous alterations in clinical melanoma samples, with gene amplification perhaps contributing to mask the heterozygous state.","title":"Biological insights into BRAFV600 mutations in melanoma patient: Not mere therapeutic targets.","pubmedId":"24179707"}
