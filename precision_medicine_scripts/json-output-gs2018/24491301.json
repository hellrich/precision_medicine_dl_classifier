However, little is known about the role these mutations play in cancer stem cells (CSCs) associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis.\nWe analyzed tissue from CRC patients (n \u003d 49) to determine whether K-Ras mutations contributed to CSC activation during colorectal tumorigenesis. DLD-1-K-Ras-WT and DLD-1-K-Ras-MT cells were cultured and evaluated for their ability to differentiate, form spheroids in vitro, and form tumors in vivo. Interaction between APC and K-Ras mutations in colorectal tumorigenesis was evaluated using APC (Min/+)/K-Ras (LA2) mice and DLD-1-K-Ras-WT and DLD-1-K-Ras-MT cell xenografts. (n \u003d 4) Group differences were determined by Student t test. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nThe sphere-forming capability of DLD-1-K-Ras-MT cells was statistically significantly higher than that of DLD-1-K-Ras-WT cells (DLD-1-K-Ras-MT mean \u003d 86.661 pixel, 95% confidence interval [CI] \u003d 81.701 to 91.621 pixel; DLD-1-K-Ras-WT mean \u003d 42.367 pixel, 95% CI \u003d 36.467 to 48.267 pixel; P \u003d .003). Moreover, both the size and weight of tumors from DLD-1-K-Ras-MT xenografts were markedly increased compared with tumors from DLD-1-K-Ras-WT cells. Expression of the CSC markers CD44, CD133, and CD166 was induced in intestinal tumors from APC (Min/+)/K-Ras (LA2)mice, but not K-Ras (LA2) mice, indicating that APC mutation is required for CSC activation by oncogenic K-Ras mutation.\nK-Ras mutation activates CSCs, contributing to colorectal tumorigenesis and metastasis in CRC cells harboring APC mutations. Initial activation of β-catenin by APC loss and further enhancement through K-Ras mutation induces CD44, CD133, and CD166 expression.","title":"Role of oncogenic K-Ras in cancer stem cell activation by aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling.","pubmedId":"24491301"}
