Cells expressing fewer than 5,000 molecules of p97 were not killed. The presence of 10 mM ammonium chloride significantly increased the efficiency of the immunotoxin, tumor cells expressing high levels of p97 being killed at immunotoxin concentrations as low as 10(-10) M.","title":"Human melanoma cells can be killed in vitro by an immunotoxin specific for melanoma-associated antigen p97.","pubmedId":"7141740"}
