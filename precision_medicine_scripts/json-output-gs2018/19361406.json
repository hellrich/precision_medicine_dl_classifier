The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is crucial in the development and progression of human epithelial cancers. The combined treatment with EGFR inhibitors has a synergistic growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic activity in different human cancer cells which possess a functional EGFR-dependent autocrine growth pathway through to a more efficient and sustained inhibition of Akt. But resistance has been observed in case of KRAS mutation. Inhibition of a single transduction pathway is often inefficient due to activation of alternative signalling. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key intracellular kinase integrating proliferation, survival and angiogenic pathways and has been implicated in the resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Thus, mTOR blockade is pursued to interfere at multiple levels with tumour growth. Targeting mTOR pathway overcomes resistance to EGFR inhibitors and produces a cooperative effect with EGFR inhibitors, providing a valid therapeutic strategy to be tested in a clinical setting.","title":"[Biological criteria of eligibility for a treatment against EGFR].","pubmedId":"19361406"}
