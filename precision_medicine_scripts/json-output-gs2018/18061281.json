These cancers are exceedingly rare at ages younger than 5 years. Although the disease is biologically more aggressive in children when compared with adults, the prognosis is better. There are only few case reports in the literature describing papillary thyroid carcinoma under age 5. In this case report, a 3-year-old child with bilateral multiple masses on the neck that were present for 6 months and who was diagnosed with thyroid papillary carcinoma is presented, and the diagnosis and therapy of the disease is discussed.","title":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma in a 3-year-old child: case report.","pubmedId":"18061281"}
