More recently, CDK6 has also been shown to have a transcriptional role in tumor angiogenesis. Up-regulated CDK6 activity is associated with the development of several types of cancers. While CDK6 is over-expressed in cancer cells, it has a low detectable level in non-cancerous cells and CDK6-null mice develop normally, suggesting a specific oncogenic role of CDK6, and that its inhibition may represent an ideal mechanism-based and low toxic therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment. Identification of selective small molecule inhibitors of CDK6 is thus needed for drug development. Herein, we review the latest understandings of the biological regulation and oncogenic roles of CDK6. The potential clinical relevance of CDK6 inhibition, the progress in the development of small-molecule CDK6 inhibitors and the rational design of potential selective CDK6 inhibitors are also discussed.
