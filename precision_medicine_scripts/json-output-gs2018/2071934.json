Despite extensive research, the precise surface phenotype of TIL remains to be fully defined. To elucidate this unsolved problem, we established 11 TIL clones derived from rIL-2 expanded TIL obtained from B16-F10 murine melanoma tumors. These clones could be divided phenotypically into four groups: CD8 (+) T-cell clones, natural killer (NK)-cell clones, NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clones, and double negative T-cell clones. Functionally, CD8 (+) T-cell clones demonstrated specific cytotoxic activity against B16-F10 melanoma cells, whereas NK-cell clones and double negative T-cell clones demonstrated only non-specific cytotoxic activity against NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells. NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clones showed dual cytotoxic activity. Clones T1 [a CD8 (+) T-cell clone] and T2 [an NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clone] which had cytotoxic activity against B16-F10 melanoma cells, demonstrated a proliferative response against immunoblotted B16-F10 melanoma antigens, whereas clones T7 (an NK-cell clone) and T10 (a double negative T-cell clone), which had no cytotoxic activity against B16-F10 cells, demonstrated no proliferative response against them. Winn assays revealed that only the CD8 (+) T-cell clone (T1) had an antitumor effect in vivo, whereas the double negative T-cell clone (T10) and NK-like CD8 (+) T-cell clone (T2) stimulated tumor growth in vivo. Adoptive immunotherapy using tumor-specific, highly cytotoxic TIL clones may represent a useful future immunotherapeutic option for the treatment of human tumors.","title":"Production and characterization of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte clones derived from B16-F10 murine melanoma.","pubmedId":"2071934"}
