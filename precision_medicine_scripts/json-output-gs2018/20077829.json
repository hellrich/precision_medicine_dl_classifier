A 53-year-old man and a 68-year-old man who had been suffering form alleviate pain in their left shoulder and arms were referred to our hospital. Physical examination revealed Horner\u0027s syndrome on the left side in both patients. A transcutaneous needle biopsy confirmed non-small-cell lung cancer. Under the diagnosis of superior sulcus tumor in stage IIIB (T4N0M0), induction chemotherapy and radiation were given. After tumor reduction, they underwent resection through cervical anterior approach because subclavian vessel invasion was suspected. The clavicle was divided for the resection and reconstruction of subclavian artery in case 2. For the treatment of anterior superior sulcus tumors, anterior approach provides a safe and effective exposure.","title":"[Induction chemoradiation followed by resection through anterior approach for superior sulcus tumor].","pubmedId":"20077829"}
