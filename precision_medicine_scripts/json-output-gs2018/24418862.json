We encountered 3 patients with CLL/SLL (one 59-y-old man and 2 women aged 56 and 66 y) who developed T-cell lymphomas. Both women developed ALK anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs), whereas the man developed CD8 peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. All 3 T-cell lymphomas expressed granzyme B and perforin, indicating a cytotoxic immunophenotype. In 1 case, the first presentation was a lymph nodal composite lymphoma. In the other 2 cases, the T-cell lymphomas arose \u003c1 year after the diagnosis of CLL/SLL and were identified in a lymph node in one case and in the spleen in the other. The patient with a composite lymphoma (SLL/ALK ALCL) was treated and was free of disease at last follow-up, whereas the other 2 patients succumbed to their disease, 1 month and 7 months after the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas rarely occur in CLL/SLL patients. On the basis of our small series, those with a cytotoxic phenotype appear to be more common in this setting. The occurrence of ALK ALCL in 2 older patients was especially surprising and suggested that CLL/SLL may have played a role in the development of ALCL.
