Many studies indicate that the proteases function as part of an extensive multidirectional network of proteolytic interactions. Disturbance of strictly controlled equilibrium of the proteolytic system is described in a number of diseases, including cancer. The paper presents a review of the available data concerning the contribution of intracellular, extracellular and intramembrane proteolysis to the process of squamous cell head and neck carcinoma. Specific mechanisms of interaction of different proteolytic systems in cancer progression both in general and in squamous cell head and neck carcinoma remain underinvestigated. The versatility offunctions and complexity of the relationships between proteolytic systems highlights the importance of studying the participation of all degradome components in tumor progression that may clarify the multi-link complex mechanisms of carcinogenesis of squamous cell head and neck carcinoma and to identify markers of progression and/or a targets for therapeutic intervention.","title":"[Degradome Components in Progression of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck].","pubmedId":"27093796"}
