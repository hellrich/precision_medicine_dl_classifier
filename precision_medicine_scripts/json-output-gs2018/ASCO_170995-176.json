Studies showed the correlation of PD-L1 expression in tumor or inflammatory cells, with clinical outcomes, which indicate that PD-L1 may be a predictive biomarker. PD-L1 expression on tumors contributes to tumor escape from immune surveillance. Here we describe the development of a highly reproducible and robust immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay for melanoma. Methods: IHC staining procedure was performed using the Dako Autostainer Link 48 platform (Dako AS480) and an automated staining protocol validated for the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay. Deparaffinization, rehydration and target retrieval was performed in the PT Link (Dako PT100) using a 3-in-1 procedure. The enzymatic conversion of the subsequently added 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) chromogen followed by DAB enhancer resulted in precipitation of a visible reaction product at the site of antigen. The specimens were then counterstained with Hematoxylin and coverslipped. Results were interpreted using a light microscope. Results: The in-house analytical validation consisted of inter-instrument, -operator, -day, and lot, and intra-day and -run variations. Robustness studies included differences in target retrieval time, temperature and pH. Negative, positive and overall agreements met the acceptance criteria for all these studies. Interpretation included PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells. Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate that the Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 assay is a sensitive, specific, precise, and robust assay, which can reliably identify patients who express PD-L1 as a biomarker across multiple tumor types.
