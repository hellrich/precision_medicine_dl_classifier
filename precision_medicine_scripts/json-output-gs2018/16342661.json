Mature B-cell neoplasms comprise more than 85% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas worldwide and can be further subclassified according to the postulated cell of origin by using specific morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular characteristics. Similarly, the more uncommon mature T-cell neoplasms have been better characterized to include numerous distinct entities with widely varying natural histories. The distinction between lymphoma and leukemia is somewhat arbitrary and is based on variable involvement of the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and lymphatic system. In this article, we review the diagnostic and clinical features of mature B-cell and T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders that commonly have a leukemic presentation.","title":"Chronic lymphoid leukemias other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia: diagnosis and treatment.","pubmedId":"16342661"}
