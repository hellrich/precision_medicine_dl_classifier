They emphasize the importance of routine preoperative pancolonoscopy for the identification of possible synchronous tumors (both benign and malignant) and periodic endoscopic follow-up (ideally a life-long one) for the detection and removal of all adenomatous polyps as well as early stage metachronous carcinomas, especially for patients with HNPCC. Besides, they stress the importance of sensibilization of the population about the heritability of colorectal carcinomas.","title":"[Synchronous and metachronous colorectal cancers: a case series contribution].","pubmedId":"10645062"}
