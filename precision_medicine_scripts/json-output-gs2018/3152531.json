Secretory products of mast cells may be important in the regulation of collagen synthesis by fibroblasts and Schwann cells. Newer methods of detecting mast cells by avidin staining of granules and localization of membrane Fc receptors for IgE have been exploited in at least one experimental model of fibrosis (murine chronic graft-versus-host disease). Such approaches should help in understanding parameters involved in modulation of cell growth in neurofibromas. Future directions for the study of cellular dynamics in neurofibromas should include detection of activated (degranulated) mast cells, Schwann cells and effects of mast cell products on collagen gene expression.","title":"Mast cells and neurofibromatosis.","pubmedId":"3152531"}
