Their activity is negatively regulated by AKT-mediated phosphorylation. Our previous studies showed that the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR) was inhibited by PTEN in an AKT-sensitive manner. Here, we report the repression of the activity of the full-length AR and its N-terminal domain by FoxO1 and the participation of FoxO1 in AR inhibition by PTEN. Ectopic expression of active FoxO1 decreased the transcriptional activity of AR as well as androgen-induced cell proliferation and production of prostate-specific antigen. FoxO1 knock down by RNA interference increased the transcriptional activity of the AR in PTEN-intact cells and relieved its inhibition by ectopic PTEN in PTEN-null cells. Mutational analysis revealed that FoxO1 fragment 150-655, which contains the forkhead box and C-terminal activation domain, was required for AR inhibition. Mammalian two-hybrid and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated that the inhibition of AR activity by PTEN through FoxO1 involved the interference of androgen-induced interaction of the N- and C-termini of the AR and the recruitment of the p160 coactivators to its N terminus and to the androgen response elements of natural AR target genes. These studies reveal new mechanisms for the inhibition of AR activity by PTEN-FoxO axis and establish FoxO proteins as important nuclear factors that mediate the mutual antagonism between AR and PTEN tumor suppressor in prostate cancer cells.","title":"FoxO1 mediates PTEN suppression of androgen receptor N- and C-terminal interactions and coactivator recruitment.","pubmedId":"19074551"}
