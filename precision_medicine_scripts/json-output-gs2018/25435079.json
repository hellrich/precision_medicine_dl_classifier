As a result, agents that target a specific member of the ErbB family have been developed for the treatment of cancer. These agents include the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib and gefitinib; the EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab; and the HER2-targeting monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Lapatinib is a dual TKI that targets both EGFR and HER2. In addition, TKIs that inhibit multiple members of the ErbB family and also bind their targets irreversibly are under evaluation for the treatment of cancer. Three such compounds have progressed into clinical studies: the EGFR, HER2, and HER4 inhibitors afatinib, dacomitinib, and neratinib. Phase I studies of these agents have shown clinical activity in NSCLC, breast cancer, and other malignancies. Currently, afatinib is approved for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and is in development for squamous NSCLC, and dacomitinib is in phase III of clinical development for NSCLC, neratinib is in phase III of clinical development for the treatment of breast cancer, and afatinib is also in phase III development in head and neck cancer. Final results from clinical trials may lead to the potential approval of these agents in a variety of solid tumor malignancies.
