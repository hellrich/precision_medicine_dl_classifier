However, vascular adverse events and selection of resistant compound mutations limit its clinical utility. Hence, there is an unmet need for novel therapies for patients with gatekeeper-mutated Ph+ leukemia. In this study we integrated comprehensive drug sensitivity testing with structural analysis to characterize the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a putative novel therapy for BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemias.To address this we profiled BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven CML/Ph+ ALL patient samples against 300 anti-cancer compounds (approved and investigational drugs). Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing of primary cells derived from a Ph+ ALL patient revealed a marked and cancer-selective response to the VEGFR inhibitor axitinib. Strikingly, axitinib exhibited higher sensitivity in T315I positive Ph+ patient samples in comparison to T315I negative CML and ALL patient samples. In line with the ex vivo drug response data, axitinib inhibited the kinase activity of ABL1(T315I) with similar potency as its primary target VEGFR2, while the potency to non-mutated ABL1 was 30-fold lower. Analogously, in engineered Ba/F3 cells, axitinib showed a 10-fold higher inhibition of T315I than non-mutated ABL1-driven autophosphorylation and cell growth. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of the BCR-ABL1(T315I) selectivity, we solved the crystal structure of axitinib in complex with ABL1(T315). The structure revealed that axitinib bound to a mutation induced active conformation of ABL1(T315I), different than the binding mode in non-mutated ABL1, likely explaining the increased potency towards ABL1(T315I). Moreover, axitinib occupied a distinct binding space than all approved ABL1 inhibitors, signifying that axitinib will have a unique mutation vulnerability profile. Compassionate two week treatment of a CML patient harboring the T315I mutation with axitinib, resulted in a 5-fold reduction of T315I transcript levels in the bone marrow, further suggesting that axitinib can produce specific and effective responses in patients with BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemia.In conclusion, we demonstrate that axitinib potently inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) via a gatekeeper mutant-selective mechanism. Since axitinib is in clinical use for treatment of refractory renal cell carcinoma with a manageable safety profile, our data provide a sound basis for readily repurposing axitinib for BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemia. Finally, the distinct mechanism of inhibition by axitinib serves as an exemplar for development of even more effective gatekeeper-mutant selective inhibitors targeting ABL1 as well as other clinically important kinases, such as EGFR and KIT.","title":"Axitinib targets gatekeeper-mutant BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemia in a distinct and selective fashion","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-676"}
