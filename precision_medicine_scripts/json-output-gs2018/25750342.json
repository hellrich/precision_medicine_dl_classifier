The main clinical manifestations include multiple BCCs, odontogenic keratocysts of the jaw, hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles, skeletal abnormalities, intracranial calcifications and facial deformities.\nA 31-year-old male diagnosed with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome with multiple unresectable facial BCCs was treated with the Hedgehog inhibitor vismodegib.\nAfter one month of therapy on vismodegib, there were significant reductions in the size of multiple BCCs on the patient\u0027s face. The patient remains on this therapy.\nHedgehog pathway inhibition is an effective strategy to treat unresectable BCCs from Gorlin-Goltz syndrome. Although vismodegib shows some promising clinical results in the early phase of its use, there are concerns of possible resistance developing within months. Duration of therapy, role of maintenance treatment and drug modification to reduce resistance need to be explored in future case studies.","title":"Treatment of multiple unresectable basal cell carcinomas from Gorlin-Goltz syndrome: a case report.","pubmedId":"25750342"}
