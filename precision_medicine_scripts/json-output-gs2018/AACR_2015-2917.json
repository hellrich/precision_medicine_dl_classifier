Addressing this clinical challenge requires the development of targeted therapies. This study shows that many EWS cell lines are selectively sensitive to a death receptor DR5 antibody and are more resistant to a DR4 antibody. Preclinical evaluation of these cell lines indicates their sensitivity to human DR5 agonist antibody conatumumab in vitro, which induces rapid activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis. Further analysis reveals the correlation of sensitivity to conatumumab with the expression of caspase-8, with its catalytic activity both necessary and sufficient to confer such sensitivity. In vivo, conatumumab has active against both EWS cell lines and a patient-derived xenograft with higher caspase-8 expression, but is not effective against another patient-derived xenograft with lower caspase-8 expression. These studies suggest the potential of conatumumab as a therapeutic agent against EWS and caspase-8 as a biomarker for correlative studies.","title":"Caspase-8 expression is predictive of tumor response to death receptor 5 agonist antibody conatumumab in Ewing\u0027s sarcoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2917"}
