ABL1 kinase domain mutations in CML with the e19a2 rearrangement were seldom reported.\nThe clinical characteristics of a 45-year-old Chinese female CML patient with e19a2 BCR/ABL1 transcript were described. The mutation on the ABL gene exons was determined by sequencing the cDNA of the μ-BCR-ABL fusion product.\nThis patient developed an acquired resistance associated with two p-BCR/ABL1 mutations (E255K and G250E) during treatment with imatinib.\nHere, we report a CML patient with e19a2 transcripts, carrying E255K and G250E mutation and experience of nilotinib treatment. The μ-BCR/ABL1 mutation should be investigated after imatinib treatment failure.","title":"E255K and G250E mutation appearing in a patient with e19a2 chronic myeloid leukemia resistant to imatinib.","pubmedId":"25807654"}
