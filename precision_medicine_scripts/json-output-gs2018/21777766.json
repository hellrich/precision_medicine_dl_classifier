Indeed, we have proceeded from a simple classification based on histology to a molecular dismemberment, with a lot of subtypes of tumors according to there molecular alteration profile. Mutations of the EGFR receptor define so a group of cancers particularly sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Gefitinib has shown its efficacy in term of response and survival in first line treatment of NSCLC arboring EGFR mutations. Recently, the ALK-AML4 translocation has been found in approximately 5% of NSCLC, accessible to a specified targeted therapy (crizotinib) with response rate around 60%. NSCLC with HER2 mutation or amplification could be treated with trastuzumab, whereas treatments targeting Met pathway are currently in development. At last, several drugs active in case of DNA repair dysfunction, like PARP inhibitors, have already shown there efficacy in particular types of NSCLC. In a very near future, molecular screening of these molecular alterations should be systematic from the diagnostic, to allow a personalized treatment according to the mutation profile.","title":"[Biomarkers and targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer: present and future treatments].","pubmedId":"21777766"}
