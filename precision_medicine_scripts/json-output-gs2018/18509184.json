Patients were treated with gefitinib 250 mg/d. Tumor assessments were performed every 2 months. Responding or stable patients were treated until progression or unacceptable toxicity. All scans were reviewed independently. EGFR exons 18-21 sequence, K-ras exon 2 sequence, and MET gene copy numbers were examined in available samples. Clinical or molecular predictors of TTF were examined by multivariate analysis.\nOne hundred six patients were enrolled. Ninety patients had tumor samples for biomarker tests. Overall response rate was 50.9% (95% CI, 41.4% to 60.4%). Median TTF was 5.5 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 22.4 months. The response rate and median TTF of the patients with exon 19 deletion (n \u003d 20) were 95.0% and 8.9 months, for exon 21 L858R mutation (n \u003d 23) were 73.9% and 9.1 month, and for other types of EGFR mutations (N \u003d 12) were 16.7% and 2.3 months, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the presence of EGFR deletion exon 19 or L858R EGFR mutations in adenocarcinoma patients predicted longer TTF. High copy number of MET seemed to correlate with shorter TTF in patients with gefitinib-sensitive activating EGFR mutations.\nIn this prospective study, EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations in adenocarcinoma were the best predictors for longer TTF in stage IIIB/IV chemotherapy-naive NSCLC patients receiving first-line gefitinib monotherapy.","title":"Specific EGFR mutations predict treatment outcome of stage IIIB/IV patients with chemotherapy-naive non-small-cell lung cancer receiving first-line gefitinib monotherapy.","pubmedId":"18509184"}
