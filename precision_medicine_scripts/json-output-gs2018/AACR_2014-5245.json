The most prevalent mutation, B-RafV600E, promotes cancer cell behavior through mechanisms which are still incompletely defined. We utilized microRNA (miRNA) microarray profiling to identify a network of more than 20 miRNAs deregulated by B-Raf/MKK/ERK in melanoma cells, the majority of which modulate expression of key cancer regulatory genes and functions. Importantly, miRNAs within the network converge on protein regulation and cancer phenotypes, suggesting that these miRNAs might function combinatorially. Additionally, by altering functional levels of these miRNAs in cells with miRNA mimics and inhibitors we demonstrate that miRNAs augment effects on protein repression and cell invasion when co-expressed, and we also observe gene-specific latency and interference effects between miRNAs. Thus, B-Raf/MKK/ERK controls key aspects of cancer cell behavior and gene expression by modulating a network of miRNAs with cross-regulatory functions. The findings highlight the potential for complex interactions between coordinately regulated miRNAs within a gene expression network.","title":"A network of microRNAs contolled by oncogenic B-Raf signaling in melanoma cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-5245"}
