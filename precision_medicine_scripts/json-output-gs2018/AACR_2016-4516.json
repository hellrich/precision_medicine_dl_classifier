The various BET inhibitors developed show strong anti-tumor effects against a broad range of hematologic malignancies. The BET inhibitor JQ1 shows strong anti-proliferative activity in sub-sets of multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma cell line models. At present, however, predictive biomarkers of BET inhibitor sensitivity have not been identified. We hypothesize that the chromatin state characterized by various histone post-translational modifications (acetylation, methylation, etc.), can drive sensitivity to BET inhibition. By examining basal expression of epigenetic marks in panels of sensitive and resistant heme cell line models and further validating these histone modification trends in primary AML and multiple myeloma cultures, we may be able to identify predictive biomarkers of BET inhibitor sensitivity in hematological malignancies.","title":"Evaluating the chromatin state as a predictive biomarker for BET inhibitor sensitivity in hematological malignancies","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4516"}
