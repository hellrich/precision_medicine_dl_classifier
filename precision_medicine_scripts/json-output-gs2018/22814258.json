MACC1 also regulates c-met expression. The aim of this study is to explore the expressions of MACC1 and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-met), and its relationship with invasion, metastasis, and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nMACC1 and c-met expressions were detected in 103 cases of NSCLC and 40 cases of neighboring normal lung cancer tissue using immunohistochemistry.\nMACC1 and c-met expressions were significantly higher in lung cancer tissues than that in neighboring normal tissue (P\u003c0.001). MACC1 and c-met expressions were associated with poor differentiation, advanced T stages, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stages (P\u003c0.05) of NSCLC, but not with sex, age, smoking, and histological classification (P\u003e0.05). In addition, a positive correlation between MACC1 and c-met expressions was observed (r\u003d0.403, P\u003c0.001). The result from the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the five-year survival rate in patients with positive MACC1 and c-met expressions was remarkanly lower than that in patients with negative expressions (P\u003c0.05). The result from the Cox regression analysis showed that MACC1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC (P\u003d0.026).\nMACC1 and c-met have an important function in the differentiation, invasion, and metastasis of NSCLC. MACC1 and c-met have poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. Moreover, MACC1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC.","title":"[Prognostic value of MACC1 and c-met expressions in non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"22814258"}
