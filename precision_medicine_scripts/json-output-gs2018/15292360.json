In this paper, we report the first documented case in which medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma were clinically expressed in members of a family affected by the codon 891 RET mutation. Genetic analysis of the RET protooncogene in this family revealed an exon 15 missense mutation at codon 891 that resulted in a serine to alanine amino acid substitution. These findings indicate that patients with this mutation should be screened for pheochromocytoma.","title":"Pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma: a new genotype-phenotype correlation of the RET protooncogene 891 germline mutation.","pubmedId":"15292360"}
