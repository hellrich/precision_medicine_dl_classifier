However, de novo and acquired antibody resistance is one of the major limitations of trastuzumab therapy warranting the search for other therapeutic strategies. One of the most remarkable features of adenovirus (AdV)-based vaccine is its ability to induce exceptionally high and sustained frequencies of transgene product-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses. In this study, we constructed two recombinant AdVs (AdV(OVA) and AdV(HER-2)) expressing ovalbumin (OVA) and HER-2/neu, and assessed AdV-induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses and preventive/therapeutic antitumor immunity. We demonstrate that AdV(OVA) stimulates efficient OVA-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer responses, leading to preventive long-term immunity against OVA-expressing BL6-10ova melanoma in wild-type C56BL/6 mice. We further demonstrate that AdV(HER-2) stimulates HER-2/neu-specific CD8(+) CTL responses, leading to a significant reduction in breast carcinogenesis in transgenic FVBneuN mice (P\u003c0.05), but has little therapeutic effect on pre-existing Tg1-1 tumor even at early stage (15 mm(3)). In contrast, the anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy is capable of completely inhibiting Tg1-1 tumor growth at early stage, but fails to eradicate well-established Tg1-1 breast tumor (100 mm(3)). Interestingly, a combinatorial immunotherapy of anti-HER-2/neu antibody with AdV(HER-2) vaccine was capable of curing 4 of 10 studied mice bearing well-established Tg1-1 breast tumors and significantly delaying in death of the remaining six tumor-bearing mice (P\u003c0.05). Taken together, our results suggest an adjuvant effect of AdV(HER-2) on anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy for well-established breast tumor in transgenic FVBneuN mice, and this combinatorial immunotherapy of trastuzumab with AdV(HER-2) vaccine may be used as a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of advanced HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer.","title":"Adjuvant effect of HER-2/neu-specific adenoviral vector stimulating CD8⁺ T and natural killer cell responses on anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy for well-established breast tumors in HER-2/neu transgenic mice.","pubmedId":"21566669"}
