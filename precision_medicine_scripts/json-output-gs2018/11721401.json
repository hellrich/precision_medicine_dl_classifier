The CD117 and CD34 double positive cells of MNC in CAA, SAA, NAA and control groups were (0.87 +/- 0.57)%, (0.65 +/- 0.41)%, (0.46 +/- 0.26)% and (0.41 +/- 0.15)%, respectively, and were significantly higher in CAA and SAA groups than in NAA and control groups (P \u003c 0.05). The CD117 positive cells of CD34 positive cells were also higher in CAA[(71.6 +/- 12.4)%] and SAA[(88.9 +/- 23.5)%] groups than in NAA[(41.8 +/- 10.3)%] and control [(46.3 +/- 9.7)%] groups (P \u003c 0.01).\nHemopoietic stem/precursor cells of aplastic anemia patients expressed more c-kit receptors than those of NAA patients and healthy controls. The hematopoiesis failure occurred in aplastic anemia is not attributed to low expression of c-kit receptor on the hemopoietic stem/precursor cells.","title":"[Expression of c-kit receptor on the hemopoietic stem/precursor cells of aplastic anemia patients].","pubmedId":"11721401"}
