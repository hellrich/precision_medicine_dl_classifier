Fourteen patients with transitional cell carcinoma had well or moderately differentiated superficial papillary tumours. One patient with adenocarcinoma died within 4 months with progressive disease. Four patients experienced recurrences and 9 patients had no recurrence of tumour after a mean follow-up of 55 months. It is concluded that the fate of patients younger than 40 years with bladder cancer is not different from those in older age groups.","title":"Carcinoma of the bladder in patients less than 40 years old.","pubmedId":"1938229"}
