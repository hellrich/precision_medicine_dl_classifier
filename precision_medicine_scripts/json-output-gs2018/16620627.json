PTCH gene mutations were detected by PCR-direct sequencing.\nSix novel PTCH mutations were identified in 6 out of 8 cases (2 sporadic and 4 NBCCS-related OKCs). Two of these were missense mutations leading to substitution of an amino acid residue respectively. The other 4 mutations were identified as insertion or deletion ranging from one single base to 7 bases, three of which caused frame-shift leading to premature truncation of PTCH protein and one resulted in an insertion of 2 amino acid residues. All these identified mutations were novel and have not been previously described.\nPTCH gene mutation is a common event in NBCCS-related OKCs and could also be detected in some sporadic OKCs. Abnormalities of PTCH gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of OKC.","title":"[PTCH gene mutations in odontogenic keratocysts].","pubmedId":"16620627"}
