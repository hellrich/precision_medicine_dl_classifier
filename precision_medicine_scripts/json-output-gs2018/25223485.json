PD-L1 may be expressed by metastatic melanoma (MM). However, its clinical and biological significance remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether expression of PD-L1 in MM identifies a biologically more aggressive form of the disease, carrying prognostic relevance.\nPD-L1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using two different antibodies in primary tumors and paired metastases from 81 melanoma patients treated at a single institution. Protein expression levels were correlated with PD-L1 mRNA, BRAF mutational status and clinical outcome. PD-L1(+) and PD-L1(-) subsets of the A375 cell line were stabilized in vitro and compared using gene expression profiling and functional assays. Results were confirmed using xenograft models.\nPD-L1 membrane positivity was detected in 30/81 (37%) of patients. By multivariate analysis, Breslow thickness and PD-L1 membrane positivity were independent risk factors for melanoma-specific death {PD-L1 5% cutoff [hazard ratio (HR) 3.92, confidence interval (CI) 95% 1.61-9.55 P \u003c 0.003], PD-L1 as continuous variable (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04 P \u003c 0.002)}. PD-L1 expression defined a subset of the BRAF-mutated A375 cell line characterized by a highly invasive phenotype and by enhanced ability to grow in xenograft models.\nPD-L1 is an independent prognostic marker in melanoma. If confirmed, our clinical and experimental data suggest that PD-L1(+) melanomas should be considered a disease subset with distinct genetic and morpho-phenotypic features, leading to enhanced aggressiveness and invasiveness.","title":"PD-L1 marks a subset of melanomas with a shorter overall survival and distinct genetic and morphological characteristics.","pubmedId":"25223485"}
