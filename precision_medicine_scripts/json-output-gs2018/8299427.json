We have shown that GAP (the GTPase-activating protein) is a potent negative regulator of normal Ras in cells. Reduction or loss of the NF1 gene product neurofibromin, in association with genetic abnormalities of the NF1 locus, has been identified in schwannoma cell lines from patients with neurofibromatosis and in melanoma and neuroblastoma lines from patients without neurofibromatosis. Although loss of neurofibromin in the schwannoma lines was associated with a high proportion of normal Ras protein in the active GTP-bound state, Ras-GTP appeared to be appropriately regulated in the melanoma and neuroblastoma lines, which contain normal levels of GAP. Therefore the GTPase-activating activity of neurofibromin is not essential for negative regulation of Ras in some cell types and the putative tumour suppressor function of neurofibromin in such cell types is independent of its GTPase-activating activity. Mitogen activation of Ras in fibroblasts is mediated primarily by exchange factors, which probably interact with a region on the Ras protein distinct from the region required for interaction with GAP. Multiple full-length cDNAs have identified a mouse gene whose products are related to yeast CDC25 guanine nucleotide exchange factor.","title":"Cell transformation by ras and regulation of its protein product.","pubmedId":"8299427"}
