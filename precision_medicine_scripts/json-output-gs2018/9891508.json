For example, osteosarcoma is common in individuals inheriting mutant p53 or Rb genes. Osteosarcoma in dogs is similar to humans by histology, site, gender ratio and several other biological parameters. To study whether this similarity extends to the molecular level, 21 canine osteosarcomas were analyzed for alterations of p53, Rb and MDM2. MDM2 is a normal cell protein which antagonizes p53, amplification is seen in some human sarcomas. The gross structure of the p53, Rb and MDM2 genes was examined by Southern blotting. No deletions or rearrangements of the p53 or Rb genes were detected. The absence of gross gene alterations affecting these tumor suppressor genes is a significant difference between the disease in dogs and humans, since rearrangements or deletions of the p53 or Rb genes occur in 20-30 per cent of human osteosarcomas. The MDM2 gene appeared to be duplicated in one canine tumor but no cases of significant amplification were detected. Expression of normal Rb was detected in all cases. Mutations of the p53 gene were found in 38 percent of canine osteosarcomas. Analysis of mutations revealed a predominance of spontaneous mutation. These finding emphasize the key role that alterations of p53 have in the development of osteosarcoma in dogs and humans.","title":"Status of the p53, Rb and MDM2 genes in canine osteosarcoma.","pubmedId":"9891508"}
