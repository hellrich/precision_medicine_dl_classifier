We tested whether functional polymorphisms within the GRP78 gene are related to clinical outcome in gastric and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.\nBlood samples of 234 stage II/III CRC patients at the University of Southern California (USC) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 137 patients with localized gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) at USC and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centers were obtained. GRP78 polymorphisms analyzed on germline DNA were correlated with clinical outcome using univariate and multivariate analyses.\nGA patients with the combined GRP78 rs391957 C/T and T/T genotype were at higher risk for tumor recurrence and death [hazard ratio (HR) 2.61; P \u003c 0.001 and HR 3.17; P \u003c 0.001, respectively], than those with C/C. These findings were subsequently tested in a CRC cohort where patients with the homozygous T/T genotype were at highest risk for tumor recurrence (HR 2.61; P \u003d 0.015). The results remained significant after adjusting for clinicopathologic determinants.\nThese data provide the first evidence that the GRP78 rs391957 polymorphism can predict clinical outcome in localized GA and locally advanced CRC patients.","title":"GRP78 promoter polymorphism rs391957 as potential predictor for clinical outcome in gastric and colorectal cancer patients.","pubmedId":"21382870"}
