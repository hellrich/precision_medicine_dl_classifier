The present study shows for the first time that a dietary administration of a selective KGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor lacks the overt-toxicities and significantly reduced the growth of small intestinal polyps in both male and female APC(Min/+) mice. This inhibition of polyp growth appears to occur at a greater extent in female mice.","title":"Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of N-ethylamino-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-quinoline-3-carboxamide for inhibition of intestinal tumorigenesis in APC(Min/+) mice.","pubmedId":"24507628"}
