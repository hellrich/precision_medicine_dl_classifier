We report a case of ALK-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in a 44-year-old male with progressively worsening unilateral nasal congestion and obstruction secondary to a nasopharyngeal mass. Radiologically, the mass was showed to extend to orophanrynx from nasopharynx. Histologically, the tumor cells exhibited plasmablastic morphology with expression of Bob-1, CD4, CD10, CD45, CD56, CD138, EMA, MUM1, Oct-2, and kappa immunoglobulin light chain, but negative for CD20, CD30, CD79a, PAX-5, and lambda. More importantly, the neoplastic cells showed positive immunoreactivity for ALK with exclusive cytoplasmic granular staining pattern. This case represented the second reported ALK-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the nasopharyngeal region.","title":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma presenting as an isolated nasopharyngeal mass: a case report and review of literature.","pubmedId":"21326807"}
