These leukemias were assigned to definite subtypes of lymphocytic and myelo(mono)-cytic leukemias on the basis of standard leukemia phenotyping using morphological, cytochemical, isoenzymatic and mainly immunological criteria. The MoAb MCS-2 was negative in all cases of lymphocytic leukemia, whereas two of the three other commonly used \"myeloid MoAbs\" MCS-1, OKM-1 and 1/12/13 showed positivity in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), B-lymphoma (MCS-1), T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and SÃ©zary syndrome (OKM-1). MCS-2 was positive in all samples of acute myelomonoblastic leukemia (AMMoL), chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and CML-myeloid blast crisis, which was not the case for MCS-1, OKM-1, or 1/12/13. In 14 cases (11 acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), 3 CML-myeloid blast crisis) where MCS-2 was positive and one or all of the three other MoAbs were negative, the cells were mainly Ia-positive and peroxidase-negative. MCS-2 is a diagnostically important MoAb in the routine leukemia phenotyping of myelomonocytic leukemias. After having tested a large number of normal and malignant specimens, we would like to term MCS-2 a \"pan-myeloid MoAb\" reacting with the myelomonocytic cell lineage from the earliest myeloblast to granulocytes and monocytes.","title":"\"Pan-myeloid\" reagent: the monoclonal antibody MCS-2 in the routine immunodiagnostic service of leukemia phenotyping.","pubmedId":"3922842"}
