To study this at a genome-wide level in melanoma we analyzed the methylome of 44 cases of malignant melanoma with the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment enriched by LM-PCR) assay and compared it to melanocyte controls. We saw widespread demethylation in melanoma occurring preferentially outside of CpG islands. Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions demonstrated that demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. Parallel transcriptomic analysis revealed many known and novel oncogenic pathways aberrantly expressed and regulated by loss of DNA methylation.The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by immunohistochemistry on primary tumors and by Western blotting in BRAF V600E mutant and WT melanoma cell lines. Expression of its ligand IL34, but not of CSF1 was also shown in the melanoma cells by both ELISA and qPCR. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in traditional and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma.Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and lead to rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. In Western blotting experiments, the rebound of ERK phosphorylation after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of the CSF1R ligands CSF1 and IL34, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing CSF1R shRNA recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the CSF1R protein, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression as resistance was acquired. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. The CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397, is in clinical trials for breast and other cancers, and these data present a preclinical rationale for its study in malignant melanoma.","title":"Integrated epigenomic profiling reveals widespread demethylation in melanoma and points to the role of CSF1R-RUNX1 axis in resistance against BRAF inhibition","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1885"}
