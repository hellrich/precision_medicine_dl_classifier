In GISTs, it correlates with features linked to an aggressive phenotype, eventually resulting in secondary mutations. In vitro findings point out that L576P/KIT is constitutively activated, and shows poor imatinib sensitivity. In this work, histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analyses, coupled with mutational-molecular analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, were applied to surgical specimens. In parallel, the affinities of wild-type, L576P/KIT, and Delta559/KIT for imatinib were estimated by in silico studies. Despite imatinib treatment and the apparent clinical-imaging response, the detected histological response was very low. KIT resulted, expressed and activated in absence of secondary mutations, BRAF/NRAS mutations, and KIT/PDGFRA gene alterations. Computer modeling proved that L576P/KIT is two times less sensitive than the wild-type counterpart and considerably less affine to imatinib than the sensitive Delta559/KIT. Accordingly, the modeling evidence strongly supports the lack of tumoral regression we observed at the histological level.","title":"Activate and resist: L576P-KIT in GIST.","pubmedId":"19723893"}
