We studied the frequency of amplification of these genes in a series of 48 dedifferentiated liposarcomas and 68 atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas. We correlated their amplification status with clinicopathological features and outcomes. Histologically, both CDK4 (P\u003d0.007) and JUN (P\u003d0.005) amplifications were associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma, whereas amplification of the proximal parts of HMGA2 (5\u0027-untranslated region (UTR) and exons 1-3) was associated with atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (P\u003d0.01). CDK4 amplification was associated with axial tumors. Amplification of 5\u0027-UTR and exons 1-3 of HMGA2 was associated with primary status and grade 1. Shorter overall survival was correlated with: age \u003e64 years (P\u003d0.03), chemotherapy used in first intent (P\u003c0.001), no surgery (P\u003d0.003), grade 3 (P\u003c0.001), distant metastasis (P\u003c0.001), node involvement (P\u003d0.006), and CDK4 amplification (P\u003d0.07). In multivariate analysis, distant metastasis (HR\u003d8.8) and grade 3 (HR\u003d18.2) were associated with shorter overall survival. A shorter recurrence-free survival was associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (P\u003c0.001), grade 3 (P\u003c0.001), node involvement (P\u003c0.001), distant metastasis (P\u003d0.02), recurrent status (P\u003d0.009), axial location (P\u003d0.001), and with molecular features such as CDK4 (P\u003d0.05) and JUN amplification (P\u003d0.07). Amplification of 5\u0027-UTR and exons 1-3 (P\u003d0.08) and 3\u0027-UTR (P\u003d0.01) of HMGA2 were associated with longer recurrence-free survival. Distant metastasis was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (HR\u003d5.8) in multivariate analysis. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma type was associated with axial location, grade 3 and recurrent status. In conclusion, we showed that the amplification of HMGA2 was associated with the atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma histological type and a good prognosis, whereas CDK4 and JUN amplifications were associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma histology and a bad prognosis. In addition, we also provided the first description of the molecular evolution of a well-differentiated liposarcoma into four successive dedifferentiated liposarcoma relapses, which was consistent with our general observations.
