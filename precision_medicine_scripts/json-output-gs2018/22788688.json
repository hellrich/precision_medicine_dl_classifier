To better understand the mechanism(s) of action and to identify novel biomarkers associated with the clinical benefit and toxicity of ipilimumab, baseline characteristics and changes in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from melanoma patients receiving ipilimumab were characterized by gene profiling and flow cytometry.\nMicroarray analysis of flow-cytometry purified CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was employed to assess gene profiling changes induced by ipilimumab. Selected molecules were further investigated by flow cytometry on pre, 3-month and 6-month post-treatment specimens.\nIpilimumab up-regulated Ki67 and ICOS on CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells at both 3- and 6-month post ipilimumab (p ≤ 0.001), decreased CCR7 and CD25 on CD8(+) at 3-month post ipilimumab (p ≤ 0.02), and increased Gata3 in CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells at 6-month post ipilimumab (p ≤ 0.001). Increased EOMES(+)CD8(+), GranzymeB(+)EOMES(+)CD8(+) and decreased Ki67(+)EOMES(+)CD4(+) T cells at 6 months were significantly associated with relapse (all p ≤ 0.03). Decreased Ki67(+)CD8(+) T cells were significantly associated with the development of irAE (p \u003d 0.02). At baseline, low Ki67(+)EOMES(+)CD8(+) T cells were associated with relapse (p ≤ 0.001), and low Ki67(+)EOMES(+)CD4(+) T cells were associated with irAE (p ≤ 0.008).\nUp-regulation of proliferation and activation signals in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were pharmacodynamic markers for ipilimumab. Ki67(+)EOMES(+)CD8(+) and Ki67(+)EOMES(+)CD4(+)T cells at baseline merit further testing as biomarkers associated with outcome and irAEs, respectively.","title":"Biomarkers on melanoma patient T cells associated with ipilimumab treatment.","pubmedId":"22788688"}
