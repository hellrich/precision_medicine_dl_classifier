Its clinical manifestations mimicked chronic meningitis. Review of 29 primary meningeal gliomas disclosed that 27 gliomas were primary in the leptomeninges, and two were in the dura mater. Twenty gliomas were solitary and 9 tumors were diffuse. There were 17 intracranial, 7 intraspinal, and 5 combined intracranial and intraspinal. About 40 per cent of primary solitary intracranial leptomeningeal gliomas were situated around the lateral fissure of the brain. The most common astrocytoma comprised 48 per cent of primary meningeal gliomas. Other gliomas were less common. The patients\u0027 average age was 44 years for both sexes. There was no distinct sexual preponderance in distribution of primary meningeal gliomas.","title":"Primary diffuse leptomeningeal glioblastoma multiforme of brainstem and spinal cord clinically mimicking meningitis: case report and review of literature.","pubmedId":"8855617"}
