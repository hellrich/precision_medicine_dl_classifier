On admission, he had symptoms of incomplete paraplegia and urinary and rectal incontinence. Workup studies for staging revealed para-aortic lymph node swellings and multiple bone involvement including skull, ribs, left iliac bone, and thoracic/lumbar spine. Because paraplegia was rapidly progressive, a decompression operation was performed. The biopsy specimen obtained from the lumbar spine revealed sheetlike proliferation of anaplastic large cells. These cells were positive for CD30 (Ki-1), EMA, vimentin, and p80NPM/ALK, and negative for CD3, CD20 (L26), and CD45 (LCA). Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs were not detectable in these cells. Thus, the patient was diagnosed as having ALCL of the null-cell type. He was treated with several courses of combination chemotherapy, and finally with total body irradiation plus high-dose chemotherapy supported by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. However, soon after the treatment, the lymphoma cells massively infiltrated his bone marrow. He died of lymphoma 8 months after admission.","title":"Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma of null-cell type with multiple bone involvement.","pubmedId":"9875667"}
