To elucidate the immunological characteristics of YM-Antibody, it and 6 other commercially available antibodies were investigated immunohistochemically by applying them to squamous cell carcinomas and non-malignant tissues obtained from various regions of the head and neck. The results showed high positivity of YM-Antibody (85.0%) on squamous cell carcinoma and extremely low false-positivity (10.5%) on non-malignant tissue. These findings suggest that the diagnostic efficacy of this YM-Antibody is 76.2%, while that of the other antibodies was less than 50%. The YM-Antibody will be useful as a diagnostic tool for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","title":"[Immunohistochemical study of a new squamous cell carcinoma-associated antibody (YM-antibody) prepared from cultured laryngeal carcinoma cells].","pubmedId":"7707180"}
