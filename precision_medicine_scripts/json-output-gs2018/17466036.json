Thirty-eight matched pre- and posttreatment pairs of paraffin-embedded endometrial biopsies were obtained from patients with EH. Immunohistochemical analysis for PTEN, p27, and phospho-mTOR were performed on all samples. Median age at diagnosis was 49 years (20-79 years). Median treatment interval was 3 months (1-12 months). Sixteen patients (42.1%) had complete resolution of their hyperplasia (responders), and 22 (57.9%) had persistent hyperplasia (nonresponders) after treatment with progesterone. In the pretreatment samples, no markers were found to predict nonresponders. In posttreatment samples, loss of PTEN expression with phospho-mTOR expression was observed in more nonresponders than responders (40.9% vs 6.3%; P\u003d 0.03). Phospho-mTOR overexpression was found in 63.6% of nonresponders. We found that persistent hyperplasia refractory to progesterone therapy was associated both with the loss of PTEN and with the loss of phosphorylation of mTOR. In select cases of non-responsive progesterone refractory EH, a rational target for treatment may involve the mTOR pathway.","title":"Loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 and phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin are associated with progesterone refractory endometrial hyperplasia.","pubmedId":"17466036"}
