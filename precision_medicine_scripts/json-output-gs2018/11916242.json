We have developed an aerosol system utilizing a cationic polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), for topical gene delivery to the lungs as a novel approach for treatment of lung cancer. Using a B16-F10 murine melanoma model in C57BL/6 mice, we previously demonstrated that aerosol delivery of PEI-p53 DNA resulted in highly significant reductions in the tumor burden (P \u003c .001) in treated animals, and also lead to about 50% increase in the mean length of survival of the mice-bearing B16-F10 lung tumors. The mechanisms of this antitumor effect of p53 are investigated in this report. Here, we demonstrate that the p53 transfection leads to an up-regulation of the antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in the lung tissue and the serum of the mice. Furthermore, there is a down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the lung tissue and serum of the B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice treated with PEI-p53 DNA complexes, compared with untreated tumor-bearing animals. In addition, staining for von Willebrand factor (vWF), a marker for the angiogenic blood vessels, revealed that p53 treatment leads to a decrease in the angiogenic phenotype of the B16-F10 tumors. Immunohistochemistry for transgene expression reveals that the PEI-p53 aerosol complexes transfect mainly the epithelial cells lining the airways, with diffuse transfection in the alveolar lining cells, as well as, the tumor foci in the lung tissue. There was also some evidence of apoptosis in the lung tumor foci of animals treated with p53. The data suggest that aerosol delivery of PEI-p53 complexes leads to inhibition of B16-F10 lung metastases, in part by suppression of angiogenesis.","title":"Aerosol delivery of PEI-p53 complexes inhibits B16-F10 lung metastases through regulation of angiogenesis.","pubmedId":"11916242"}
