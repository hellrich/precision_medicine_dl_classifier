Despite an overall good prognosis of the most frequent endocrine malignancy, 10-15 % of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) turn refractory to radioactive iodine therapy. The increased incidence of thyroid cancer has led to the search for solid prognostic biomarkers that predict the behaviour of these tumours. Clinical and histopathological prognostic factors remain the only safe elements to be used for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with thyroid tumours. Despite the huge amount of genetic information of thyroid tumours, very few new markers revealed diagnostic or prognostic value per se. BRAF mutation can have some value if associated to other clinico-pathological parameters, or in the particular setting of iodine refractory tumours. Others can prove interesting in the future as predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response, but more studies are needed to confirm these potential biomarkers.","title":"Prognostic biomarkers in thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"24487783"}
