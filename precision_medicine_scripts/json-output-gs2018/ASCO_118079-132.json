Methods:  We performed an NGS-based diagnostic test (FoundationOne) to characterize all classes of GA across 3,320 exons of 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns of 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer on 386 LC FFPE specimens in a CLIA-certified lab (Foundation Medicine). Specimens included fine needle aspirates, core needle biopsies, and malignant effusions.  95% of cases were NSCLC (367/386). Actionable GAs are defined as those linked to targeted anti-cancer therapies approved or being evaluated in clinical trials.  NGS confirmed known hotspot results for EGFR, KRAS and EML4:ALK in 100% of cases.  Results:    Genomic profiles were generated from 364/386 (94%) of lung cancer cases, identifying 1205 GA, averaging 3.31 alterations per tumor (range 0 to 10).  85% of tumors (310) harbored at least one actionable GA, with a mean of 1.79 GA per tumor (range 0 to 6). In 68% of tumors (248), at least one GA was detected that would be missed by current hotspot assays. ERBB2 harbored base substitutions or indels in 1.3% of cases.  BRAF and C-Kit were altered at frequencies of 2% and 1% respectively. The mTOR/PI3K pathway is likely to be activated via alterations in tumor suppressors STK11 (11%), NF1 (6%) and PTEN (4%), as well as by alterations of PIK3CA (10%) and in AKT1/2/3 (4%), suggesting possible benefit from mTOR/PI3K inhibitors.  The Hedgehog pathway (PTCH1/SMO/SUFU) was altered in 2% of cases.  ALK and RET were rearranged in 4% and 2% of cases, respectively, with several cases initially diagnosed negative by FISH testing.   Conclusions:  Profiling the tumor genomes of 364 LC patients led to the identification of a series of GA not detectable by hotspot testing that could significantly inform targeted treatment decisions.  Moreover, actionable GA appeared in unexpected tumor type, i.e. an EGFR mutation in a SCLC, reinforcing the likely utility of clinical cancer genomic profiling for the personalized treatment of LC patients.","title":"Clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) to reveal high frequency of alterations to guide targeted therapy in lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_118079-132"}
