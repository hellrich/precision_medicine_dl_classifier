The findings reported here demonstrate that SN38 (the active metabolite of CPT-11) induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR within 5 min, followed by the induction of transcripts and/or proteins of the heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, amphiregulin, transforming growth factor-alpha, and interlukin-8 (IL-8) in AGS gastric cancer cells. SN38 also activates nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1, both of which are critical for the transcription of the IL-8 gene. However, the blocking of EGFR activation by gefitinib (\"Iressa\", ZD1839), an EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), abrogates all the above reactions. The SN38-triggered mechanisms include the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), followed by metalloproteinase activation and the sequential ectodomain shedding of EGFR ligands. These findings suggest that EGF signaling is enhanced by CPT-11 and point to the potential benefit of the use of a combination of CPT-11 with gefitinib in the treatment of certain gastric cancers.","title":"Gefitinib (\"Iressa\", ZD1839) inhibits SN38-triggered EGF signals and IL-8 production in gastric cancer cells.","pubmedId":"15723263"}
