The aim of the present study was to explore the reliability of the high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) for the identification of IDH1 R132 mutations in AML.\nWe evaluated the sensitivity of HRMA in the detection of IDH1 R132 mutation and screened IDH1 mutations in 110 AML patients using HRMA. The results of HRMA were validated by direct DNA sequencing.\nThe reproducible sensitivity of HRMA was 5% for the detection of IDH1 R132 mutation, higher than 10% of direct DNA sequencing. Heterozygous IDH1 mutations were identified in 4 (3.6%) AML cases, which were R132H in 3 cases and R132S in 1 case confirmed by DNA sequencing.\nThe HRMA is a rapid, accurate, reliable, high-throughput method to screen IDH1 gene mutations.","title":"Rapid and reliable detection of IDH1 R132 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia using high-resolution melting curve analysis.","pubmedId":"21539821"}
