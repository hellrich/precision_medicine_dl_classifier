A more frequent measurement of testosterone levels and the development of highly sensitive and specific assays have led to the detection of less clinically evident gonadal dysfunction, in which small biochemical alterations may or may not be accompanied by signs and symptoms. This condition is called \"compensated\" or \"subclinical\" hypogonadism. To determine whether subclinical hypogonadism is a paraphysiological state, a clinical condition in itself, or a precursor to overt hypogonadism, we carried out a literature review with the aim of establishing a practical approach to subclinical hypogonadism.","title":"Subclinical male hypogonadism.","pubmedId":"22863395"}
