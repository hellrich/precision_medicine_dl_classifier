BAG-1 expression was found to be significantly lower in tobacco users than in non-tobacco users. BAG-1 expression in tobacco-using leukoplakia and carcinoma patients was compared by grouping the carcinoma patients according to lymph node status and disease stage. Carcinoma patients with tumor-positive lymph nodes had significantly lower BAG-1 expression than patients with negative lymph nodes and leukoplakia. Further, a trend towards an inverse correlation was observed with p53 and c-erbB2. In univariate and multivariate survival analysis, patient subgroups with 2+ or 3+ marker positivity (BAG-1 negativity, p53 and c-erbB2 positivity) had a reduced overall survival compared with patient subgroups with 1+ marker positivity or negativity.\nBAG-1 negativity in association with p53 and c-erbB2 positivity identified a subgroup of tongue cancer patients with an aggressive phenotype. Hence, an antiapoptotic protein, BAG-1, was found to be down-regulated in chewing-tobacco-mediated tongue carcinogenesis.","title":"Cytoplasmic localization of BAG-1 in leukoplakia and carcinoma of the tongue: correlation with p53 and c-erbB2 in carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17549665"}
