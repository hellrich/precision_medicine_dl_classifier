Both groups independently undertook studies with similar chemotherapy during the period.\nThe key adverse prognostic factor is metastases at diagnosis (5-year RFS, 22% of patients with metastases at diagnosis v 55% of patients without metastases at diagnosis; P: \u003c.0001). For the group with metastases, there was a trend for better survival for those with lung involvement compared with those with bone metastases or a combination of lung and bone metastases (P: \u003c.0001). In the group of patients with no metastases at diagnosis, multivariate analysis demonstrated that site (axial v other), age-group (\u003c 15 v \u003e or \u003d 15 years), and period of diagnosis had significant influence on RFS (all P: \u003c.005). RFS was superior in the period after 1985 compared with the period before 1985 for nonmetastatic patients (45% v 60%, respectively; P: \u003c.0001) and for metastatic patients (16% v 30%, respectively; P: \u003d.016). Patients who relapsed within 2 years of diagnosis had a less favorable prognosis than patients who relapsed later (5-year survival after relapse, 4% v 23%, respectively; P: \u003c. 0001). There were other changes over the period; in particular, radiotherapy or amputation were more common in the period before 1986, whereas endoprosthetic surgery was widely used in the later period.\nSurvival and RFS improved over the period. Prognostic factors are metastases at diagnosis, primary site, and age.","title":"Prognostic factors in Ewing\u0027s tumor of bone: analysis of 975 patients from the European Intergroup Cooperative Ewing\u0027s Sarcoma Study Group.","pubmedId":"10963639"}
