Then, an age-adjusted group of 55 nonusers was chosen to match and compare with HRT users.\nOf the 243 patients available for evaluation, 55 (22.6%) used HRT. Disease stages in HRT users vs. nonusers were as follows: ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 20% and 17.1%; stage I, 45.5% and 41.7%; stage II, 30.9% and 26.2%; stage III, 3.6% and 13.4%; and stage IV, 0% and 1.6% (P \u003d.27). In the age-adjusted cohort, stages in nonusers were as follows: DCIS, 7.3%; stage I, 47.3%; stage II, 25.5%; stage III, 20%; and stage IV, 0% (P \u003d.03). Tumor grades in HRT users vs. nonusers were as follows: grade I, 30.4% and 15.7%; grade II, 52.2% and 52.2%; and grade III, 17.4% and 32.1% (P \u003d.035). Grades in cohort nonusers were as follows: I, 13.2%; II, 52.8%; and III, 34% (P \u003d.05). In the invasive tumors, the positive estrogen receptor (ER) rates were 81.6% and 85.7% (P \u003d.89); positive progesterone receptor (PR) rates were 53.1% and 54% (P \u003d.95); and Her 2-neu positive rates were 18.4% and 17.6% (P \u003d.95), respectively. No significant difference was found in intratumor DCIS, vascular invasion, and Ki-67 (P \u003d.14,.9, and.79, respectively). The rate of lobular and favorable histological types was higher in the HRT user group: 26.6% vs. 15%.\nBreast tumors in HRT users vs. nonusers were of a significantly lower stage and grade and accounted for a higher number of favorable histological types, but all other parameters were similar in the two groups.","title":"The characteristics of malignant breast tumors in hormone replacement therapy users versus nonusers.","pubmedId":"14699034"}
