Amplification of the c-myc gene was found in 18% of the samples, and in one sample a non-germ line c-myc related DNA fragment or rearrangement was detected. We have found a significant association (P \u003d 0.0010) between amplified c-myc gene and inflammatory carcinoma, a particularly aggressive breast cancer. The c-erbB-2 gene was amplified in 22% of the tumor samples and a rearrangement was observed once. Alteration of the c-erbB-2 gene was significantly linked to histological grade III tumors (P \u003d 0.005) and the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors (P \u003d 0.036). No amplifications were observed for c-erbB-1, c-Ki-ras, and c-Ha-ras genes. About 40% of breast carcinomas contain either amplified c-myc or c-erbB-2 protooncogenes, whereas simultaneous amplification of both was seen in only one sample, suggesting the involvement of two distinct molecular mechanisms in breast cancer. Comparison of DNA from peripheral blood and tumor samples indicated loss of one c-Ha-ras allele in 29% of patients heterozygous for this polymorphism. A significant correlation (P \u003d 0.016) between c-Ha-ras locus (11p14) allele loss and patient survival was found. These data suggest that 11p14 allelic loss plays a role in the evolution of human breast cancer, amplification of c-erbB-2 gene is associated with increasing stage of malignancy, and alteration of the c-myc gene in inflammatory breast carcinoma may contribute to the rapid progression of this human tumor subtype.","title":"Genetic alterations of c-myc, c-erbB-2, and c-Ha-ras protooncogenes and clinical associations in human breast carcinomas.","pubmedId":"2573420"}
