Malignant cells are frequently resistant to chemotherapy and radiation induced programmed cell death (apoptosis). This resistance can occur by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53. Strategies designed to replace this defective tumor suppressor protein, as well as forced expression of a novel cancer specific apoptosis inducing gene, melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7), offer promise for restoring apoptosis in tumor cells. Conditional-replicating viruses that selectively induce cytolysis in tumor cells provides an additional means of targeting cancer cells for destruction. Although these approaches represent works in progress, future refinements will in all likelihood result in the next generation of cancer therapies.","title":"Restoring apoptosis as a strategy for cancer gene therapy: focus on p53 and mda-7.","pubmedId":"12654260"}
