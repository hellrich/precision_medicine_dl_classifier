This technical report describes the techniques used to deliver the SSIA dose of cetuximab, as well as the patient outcome.\nThis technical report is part of an ongoing Phase I Clinical Trial.\nThe New York Head and Neck Institute (NYHNI) is a full-service otolaryngology and neurosurgery department at Lenox Hill Hospital, part of the Northwell Health System. The NYHNI serves a diverse patient population with a wide range of head and neck diseases in a tertiary hospital setting.\nSSIA Cetuximab.\nA patient presents to our clinic with recurrent unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx. He is recruited into the first cohort of a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety of SSIA cetuximab, dose starting at 100mg/m2. Adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy is also given.\nSafety, as measured by toxicity of SSIA cetuximab.\nSSIA Cetuximab has been demonstrated to be a safe and feasible procedure in this technical report.\nThis case illustrates technical feasibility and a very preliminary assessment of the safety of a novel delivery of a biologic agent for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, which is part of an ongoing phase I clinical trial.\nNCT02438995.","title":"Intra-arterial cetuximab for the treatment of recurrent unresectable head and neck squamous cell carcinomaâ€ .","pubmedId":"27849340"}
