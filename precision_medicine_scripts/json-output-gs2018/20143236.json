Trans-scleral local resection and, subsequently, adjuvant brachytherapy were performed.\nHistopathology and immunohistochemistry of the specimen diagnosed an amelanotic melanoma of spindle cell type, with a moderately high number of mitoses (7/40 HPF). Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis showed two copies of chromosome 3, three copies of the short arm of chromosome 6, and two copies of chromosome 8, strongly suggesting a good prognosis. Postoperative ophthalmic evaluation at 6 months showed no visible tumor and flat retina with visual acuity (VA) of 6/60.\nTrans-scleral local resection with adjuvant brachytherapy in children is possible using the same techniques as for adults. Although the follow-up is short, our patient retained the eye with good vision and our cytogenetic studies allowed us to reassure the mother.","title":"Choroidal melanoma in a 7-year-old child treated by trans-scleral local resection.","pubmedId":"20143236"}
