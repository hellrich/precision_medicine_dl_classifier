Further markers on chromosomes 3 and 9 were analyzed individually.\nLoss of heterozygosity (LOH) was identified in 63% of tumors, most frequently on chromosome 3 (52%), in association with epithelioid cells (P \u003d 0.0002) and microvascular loops (P \u003d 0.0008). In the majority of cases, LOH on chromosome 3 was detected at all informative markers. The second most common alteration was LOH at an RB1 intragenic marker (21% tumors), with retention of a more centromeric 13q marker (near BRCA2). The pattern of LOH on chromosome 9p was consistent with the involvement of a region telomeric to CDKN2A. LOH at TP53 was infrequent.\nIn the majority of cases, chromosome 3 LOH involves an entire chromosome homologue, which hampers identification of the relevant suppressor loci. This LOH correlates with the presence of microvascular loops and epithelioid cells, two of the recognized histologic indicators of poor prognosis. Data for chromosomes 13 and 9 support a role for RB1 in the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma but also raise the possibility of the involvement of additional loci close to RB1 and CDKN2A.","title":"Loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 3, 9, 13, and 17, including the retinoblastoma locus, in uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"11581185"}
