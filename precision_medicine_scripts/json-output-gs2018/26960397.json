This study sought to determine somatic mutation and gene expression patterns associated with tumor cell PD-L1 expression, or lack thereof, in stage III metastatic melanoma to better define therapeutically relevant patient subgroups.\nIHC for PD-L1 was assessed in 52 American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III melanoma lymph node specimens and compared with specimen-matched comprehensive clinicopathologic, genomic, and transcriptomic data.\nPD-L1-negative status was associated with lower nonsynonymous mutation (NSM) burden (P \u003d 0.017) and worse melanoma-specific survival [HR \u003d 0.28 (0.12-0.66), P \u003d 0.002] in stage III melanoma. Gene set enrichment analysis identified an immune-related gene expression signature in PD-L1-positive tumors. There was a marked increase in cytotoxic T-cell and macrophage-specific genes in PD-L1-positive melanomas. CD8A(high) gene expression was associated with better melanoma-specific survival [HR \u003d 0.2 (0.05-0.87), P \u003d 0.017] and restricted to PD-L1-positive stage III specimens. NF1 mutations were restricted to PD-L1-positive tumors (P \u003d 0.041).\nTumor negative PD-L1 status in stage III melanoma lymph node metastasis is a marker of worse patient survival and is associated with a poor immune response gene signature. Lower NSM levels were associated with PD-L1-negative status suggesting differences in somatic mutation profiles are a determinant of PD-L1-associated antitumor immunity in stage III melanoma.
