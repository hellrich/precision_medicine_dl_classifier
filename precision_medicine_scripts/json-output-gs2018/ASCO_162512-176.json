{"publicationTypes":["2016 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: The prevelance of thyroid lesion on PET/CT was reported as 4% and malignancy rate was 14-50%. It is difficult to differantiate benign from malignant lesion by SUV of PET-CT. Inhere, we evaluated the incidence of thyroid incidenteloma that were detected by PET-CT of primary cancer patients and analyzed any relationship between histopatological features and radiological imagings. Methods: Totally 27 patients were included. All had thyroid incidental nodules which had FDG activities were underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy(FNAB).We analyzed relationship between histopatological findings and radiological features by Pearson correlation test. After SUV max values were categorized as 0,2.2-2.9, 3-4.9, 5-6.9, 7-9.9, \u003e 10 ve 0, we evaulated any factors associated with SUVmax categorical or histopatological evaluation by using x Fisher exact test.Results: The primary malignancies were breast, colon, lung, pancreas, ovarian, gastric cancer and sarcoma in order of frequency. The median SUVmax values were 4.4 and 6.9 for thyroid noduls and primary cancer respectively. Totally 8 malignancies were detected by FNAB of thyroid nodule(29.6%). The sensitivity and specifitiy of PET-CT SUVmax value for diagnosis of malignancy were 80% and 52%respectively. On the other hand, positive and negative predictive values were 32% and 90%. The most common malign and benign patolology were classic variant papillary carcinoma and benign colloidal nodule. The SUVmax were the higher in the colon cancer thyroid metastasis and oncocytic neoplasia(SUVmax 14.5 and 13.9 respectively). While the median throid nodule size was 19 mm in diameter, there was no correlation between nodule size and histopatological findings. On the other hand histopatological findings were positively associated with both categorical SUVmax(r \u003d 0.413, p \u003d 0.03) and the density of the thyroid nodule in PET-CT(r \u003d 0.373, p \u003d 0.05). Conclusions: If the thyroid nodule is detected with FDG uptake, to differantiate benign from malign nodule, cytological examination is noteworthy to diagnose the more agressive type of thyroid nodule and thyroid metastasis from the primary cancer.","title":"The relationship between PET-CT images and histopathological features of thyroid incidenteloma, detected during follow-up of primary malignancy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_162512-176"}
