Less common BRAF mutations of V600K, V600R, L597S, and G466K have also been identified. In these rare BRAF mutants, the effects of vemurafenib (Vem) and other MAPK pathway inhibitors on signaling, growth rate and clinical course are not well understood. In cell lines with rare BRAF mutations, we investigated the effect of Vem, inhibitors of Pan-RAF (Amgen 2112819), MEK (trametinib), ERK (MERK SCH772984), Pan-RAFi+ MEKi and ERKi+Vem on growth and signaling. These results were compared to the clinical responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in patients with the original tumors. Regardless of the mutation, no paradoxical activation of MAPK pathway by Vem was observed and the Pan-Rafi decreased levels of pMEK in all the cell lines. A heterozygous V600K mutated cell line was sensitive to Vem and more sensitive to the other drugs. Clinically, the duration of response to Vem in the patient the cell line was derived from was 7 months, and an additional 3 months to the combination of Vem and MEKi upon progression on Vem. In contrast, a homozygous V600K mutated cell line was resistant to Vem but sensitive to other MAPK inhibitors. The patient the cell line was derived from had a 5 month response to Vem followed by a 2 month response to the addition of a MEKi. BRAF L597S cell line was only sensitive to ERKi and G466K and V600R mutated cell lines were resistant to all the drugs. In general, Vem was the least effective followed by Pan-RAFi with ERKi stronger than both in most cell lines. The combination of Vem and ERKi showed similar or slightly higher growth inhibition than ERKi alone. In conclusion, MAPK inhibitors are not as effective in melanoma cell lines with rare BRAF mutations. However, more growth inhibition can be achieved by MEKi-Pan-RAFi combination. These in vitro data seem to be correlated with the clinical outcomes.*Charles Ng, equal contribution","title":"Melanomas with rare BRAF mutations and their responses to MAPK pathway blocking drugs.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-915"}
