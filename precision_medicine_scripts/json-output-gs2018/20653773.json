Using an extensive genetic analysis of these genes, including sequence analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, we have found four different CDKN2A alterations in cases from seven melanoma kindred. Three of them are CDKN2A mutations previously described in the Mediterranean population (p.G101W, p.V59G and c.358delG) in addition to an undescribed deletion (p. M54del) which has been detected in a melanoma kindred. This codon deletion affects an essential residue in the interaction of p16INK4A with cdk6 and has not been reported in melanoma patients and other cancers.","title":"Novel CDKN2A mutation detected in Spanish melanoma pedigree.","pubmedId":"20653773"}
