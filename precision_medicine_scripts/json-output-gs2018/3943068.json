Although sunlight is an important factor, only a fraction of those individuals exposed to significantly large amounts of sunlight develop malignant melanoma. Genetic susceptibility undoubtedly plays an important etiologic role. We have put forth a multifaceted hypothesis, which we believe provides unification for the genetic-environmental interaction in the etiology of malignant melanoma. Genetic heterogeneity in the familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome and other single gene disorders that predispose to malignant melanoma are particularly stressed. The possibility of polygenic or multifactorial factors in the etiology of malignant melanoma remains to be elucidated.","title":"Hereditary malignant melanoma: a unifying etiologic hypothesis.","pubmedId":"3943068"}
