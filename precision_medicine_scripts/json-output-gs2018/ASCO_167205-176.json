In order to determine whether PD-L1 might be useful to identify those patients (pts) with melanoma most likely to respond to pembro, an IHC assay was developed for use in pembro clinical trials. Methods: The PD-L1 IHC assay was performed on the Dako platform using the 22C3 antiPD-L1 antibody. In contrast to development of this assay for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), scoring included mononuclear inflammatory cells intercalated and contiguous with tumor cells. A 6-point score was defined as: IHC0 (no staining), IHC1 ( \u003c 1% staining), IHC2 (1%-9%), IHC3 (10%-32%), IHC4 (33%-65%), and IHC5 (66%-100% staining). The presence of distinct patterns (interface or dendritic) was also noted. Using data from 135 patients treated with pembro in KEYNOTE-001 (NCT01295827), 88 samples were evaluable for PD-L1 IHC and had central RECIST response data for use in a training set. Samples with obscuring melanin or insufficient tumor were not evaluable. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Results: The ROC curve was somewhat flat. A score of IHC2 (1% staining) was chosen to optimize the true positive rate (clinical sensitivity) and negative predictive value. A 2  2 table is shown below comparing responders and nonresponders at the IHC2 cutoff. Assay performance could not be improved by incorporating the interface or dendritic patterns. Conclusions: PD-L1 is not a strong enough predictor of response to be used as a companion diagnostic for pembrolizumab monotherapy. However, PD-L1 testing could help guide treatment decisions in melanoma in clinical situations in which several treatment options are available. Although 66% of samples in this cohort were PD-L1positive, higher prevalence (81%) was observed in the previously reported data from KEYNOTE-006 (NCT01866319), a randomized, controlled clinical trial for pembro in melanoma.
