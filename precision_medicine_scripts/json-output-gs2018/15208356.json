With the advent of targeted therapies, especially IMC-C225 (Cetuximab), a monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against the EGFR, there is an increasing interest in immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based EGFR screening methods using paraffin-embedded tumor specimens to select cancer patients eligible for treatment with Cetuximab. With the EGFRpharmDX kit, a complete assay for demonstration of EGFR is now available. Because no information about the preservation of the EGFR under various conditions of fixation is available, we performed a prospective study on a panel of commonly used fixatives to determine optimal tissue preservation protocols. The stability of the epitope on cut tissue sections stored for a period up to 24 month was also tested using material originating from patients with head and neck cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinomas, and colorectal adenocarcinomas. Depending on the fixative used and the time of storage of cut tissue sections, a variation in the determined level of EGFR expression was demonstrated compared with the most optimal fixation procedure.","title":"Immunohistochemical detection of EGFR in paraffin-embedded tumor tissues: variation in staining intensity due to choice of fixative and storage time of tissue sections.","pubmedId":"15208356"}
