The failure of agents may be due to lack of sufficiently targeted therapeutics, but is more likely based on the activation of multiple oncogenic pathways in melanomas in addition to the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In contrast, there are groups of melanomas that instead rely on either c-KIT or CRAF signaling that may be amenable to single-agent targeted therapy. In the current review, we discuss how knowledge about these new melanoma subgroups may lead to improved strategies for treating melanomas harboring BRAF V600E mutations.","title":"Genetic subgrouping of melanoma reveals new opportunities for targeted therapy.","pubmedId":"19351826"}
