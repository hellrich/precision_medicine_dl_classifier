The physical examination of thickening and erythema made the clinical diagnosis. Mammographic findings of increased density in the right breast with coarsened stroma and an underlying mass confirmed the clinical findings. The sonographic evaluation revealed a 2-cm ill-defined hypoechoic mass. The pathologic examination of the mastectomy specimen showed an infiltrating duct cell carcinoma with lobular features. Male breast cancer afflicts 1500 men each year. Clinically it must be differentiated from gynecomastia, a much more common and benign condition.","title":"Male inflammatory breast cancer.","pubmedId":"11899787"}
