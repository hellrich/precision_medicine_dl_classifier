Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed type 2 tumors in the upper thoracic esophagus and in the lesser curvature of the angular incisure, and elevated lesions in the duodenum and in the transverse colon. Laryngoscopy revealed erosion of the right vocal cord. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a nodule in the middle lobe of the right lung. Laryngomicro surgery was performed for the right vocal cord erosion, and it was diagnosed as carcinoma in situ. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) were performed for the lesions in the duodenum and in the transverse colon, respectively; the lesions were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma in adenoma. After 2 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, and Adriamycin (FAP) regimen, subtotal esophagectomy with reconstruction of the pedunculated jejunum through the antethoracic route, total gastrectomy, and resection were performed on the right middle lobe of lung. Pathological examination revealed esophageal cancer (fT4N0M0, fStageIII), gastric cancer (ypT3N0M0, pStageIIA), and primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma (pT1bN1M0, pStageIIA). After surgery, the patient was treated with chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy, with 2 courses of 5-FU plus cisplatin [FP]), and 6 months after the operation, he was in good health without recurrence.","title":"[Six synchronous primary cancers - a case report].","pubmedId":"25731414"}
