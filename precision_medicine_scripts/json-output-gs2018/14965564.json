Overexpression was determined by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Twenty one percent were HER-2/neu positive and 40% p53 positive. HER-2/neu expression was related to axillary lymph node metastasis (P\u003d0.014), inflammatory infiltrates (P\u003d0.004), and the absence of oestrogen (ER) (P\u003d0.0026) and progesterone (P\u003d0.01) receptors (PR). p53 expression was related to lymph node involvement (P\u003d0.03), necrosis (P\u003d0.036), absence of ER (P\u003d0.028) and PR (P\u003d0.065). p53 was not associated with outcome. HER-2/neu was an unfavourable prognostic factor for disease-free (DFS) (P\u003d0.05) and overall survival (OS) (P\u003d0.02) in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that the number of involved axillary nodes (P\u003c0.00001), age (P\u003d0.004), grade (P\u003d0.04), and PR (P\u003d0.04) were independent predictors for OS. ER-positive patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen had shorter DFS and OS when they were HER-2/neu positive.","title":"Prognostic value of HER-2/neu and p53 expression in node-positive breast cancer.
