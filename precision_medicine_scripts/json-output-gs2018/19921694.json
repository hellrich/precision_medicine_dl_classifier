The small molecule PRIMA-1 has been shown to restore the tumor suppression function of p53 and to induce apoptosis in human tumor cells. The mechanism of apoptosis induced by PRIMA-1 remains unclear. We investigated the effects of PRIMA-1 in apoptosis with Western immunoblot analysis, TaqMan microRNA real-time PCR, cell viability analysis and flow cytometry using human lung cancer cell lines containing mutant (H211 and H1155), wild-type (A549) or null (H1299) p53. PRIMA-1 induced massive apoptosis in the H211 and H1155 cells, but was less toxic to the A549 and H1299 cells. Western immunoblot analysis showed cleavage of PARP in H211 and H1155 cells but not in A549 and H1299 cells following treatment with PRIMA-1. In addition, p53 protein was also phosphorylated in H211 and H1155 cells. TaqMan microRNA assay showed that the expression of microRNA-34a was increased in the H211 and H1155 cells posttreatment. Knockdown microRNA-34a decreased the rate of apoptosis caused by PRIMA-1. The above results suggest that microRNA-34a is one of the important components of PRIMA-1-induced apoptotic network in the cancer cells harboring mutant p53.","title":"MicroRNA-34a is an important component of PRIMA-1-induced apoptotic network in human lung cancer cells.","pubmedId":"19921694"}
