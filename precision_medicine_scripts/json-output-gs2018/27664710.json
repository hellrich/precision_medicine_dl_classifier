Phosphoproteomic analysis of primary human melanocytes transduced with G12 and Q61 showed different phosphorylation events in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Surprisingly, NRAS(G12) modulates the PI3K pathway and overexpresses the kinase PIM2, whereas NRAS(Q61) is associated with the MAPK pathway and overexpression of CK2α.
