The purpose of this study is to compare CD117 immunohistological staining in Spitz nevus versus malignant melanoma, to determine whether CD117 can aid in the diagnosis of these two lesions.\nCD-117 immunohistological staining was performed in 22 clinically and pathologically diagnosed pigmented lesions including 9 cases of Spitz nevus, 10 cases of primary MM and 3 cases of metastatic melanoma.\nThere was no significant difference in CD117 staining in either epidermis or dermis between Spitz nevi and primary melanomas. However staining of metastatic melanomas is less than dermal staining of primary MM and Spitz nevus.\nCD117 is unlikely a useful diagnostic tool in differentiating Spitz nevus from primary MM. On the other hand, CD 117 may be useful in differentiating metastatic melanoma from primary melanoma in patients who had a history of melanoma and who present with new dermal lesions.","title":"Expression of c-kit (CD117) in Spitz nevus and malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"16441409"}
