We detected the miR-24 expression levels using real-time quantitative PCR in 84 AML patients and investigated the clinical significance of miR-24 expression in AML. There was no difference in clinical parameters between cases with miR-24 high expression and with miR-24 low expression. The frequency of miR-24 high expression was higher in patients with t(8;21) than in others (82% (9/11) versus 44% (32/72), P\u003d0.026). The levels of miR-24 expression had no correlation with the mutations of nine genes (FLT3-ITD, NPM1, C-KIT, IDH1/IDH2, DNMT3A, N/K-RAS and C/EBPA). Meanwhile, among the group who obtained CR, the cases with miR-24 high expression had no difference in overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) than those with miR-24 low expression (P\u003d0.612 and 0.665, respectively). These findings implicated that miR-24 high regulation is a common event in AML with t(8;21), and it might serve as a novel and selective therapeutic target for the treatment of AML with t(8;21).
