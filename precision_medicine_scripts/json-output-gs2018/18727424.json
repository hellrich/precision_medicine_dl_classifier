The techniques of fluorescence and chromogenic in situ hybridization were used to study HER-2/neu gene amplification and the concordance of these techniques was examined. The advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are shown. The optimum ranges of using these techniques in the determination of the herzept status of breast cancer are given.","title":"[Comparative investigations of the determination of the HER-2 status in breast cancer by fluorescence and chromogenic in situ hybridization].","pubmedId":"18727424"}
