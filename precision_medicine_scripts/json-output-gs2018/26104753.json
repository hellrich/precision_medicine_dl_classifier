According to the results of (131)I whole-body scan (WBS), pulmonary metastases were classified as (131)I-avid and non-(131)I-avid. For patients with (131)I-avid lung metastases, treatment response was measured by three parameters: serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels, chest computed tomography (CT) and post-therapeutic (131)I-WBS. Overall survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors predictive of the outcome were determined by multivariate analyses.\nAmong patients demonstrating (131)I-avid pulmonary metastases (256/372, 68.8%), 156 cases (156/256, 60.9%) showed a significant decrease in serum Tg levels after (131)I therapy and 138 cases (138/229, 60.3%) showed a reduction in pulmonary metastases on follow-up CT. A complete cure, however, was only achieved in 62 cases (62/256, 24.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that only age, the presence of multiple distant metastases and pulmonary metastatic node size were significant independent variables between the groups of (131)I-avid and non-(131)I-avid.\nThis study indicated that, most (131)I-avid pulmonary metastases from DTC can obtain partial or complete remission after (131)I therapy. Younger patients (\u003c40 years old) with only pulmonary metastases and small (\u0027fine miliaric\u0027 or micronodular) metastases appear to have relative favorite outcomes. Patients who do not respond to (131)I treatment have a worse prognosis.","title":"Pulmonary metastases in differentiated thyroid cancer: efficacy of radioiodine therapy and prognostic factors.","pubmedId":"26104753"}
