The prognosis on patients with positive expressions of C-erbB-2 was poor, and was not related to pathologic category.\nC-erbB-2 gene may be an important regulating gene in the coal miners with pneumoconiosis complicated by pulmonary cancer, and as a reference index to determine lymph node metastasis and prognosis.","title":"[Study on the expression of C-erbB-2 gene in coal miners with pneumoconiosis complicated by pulmonary cancer].","pubmedId":"14761474"}
