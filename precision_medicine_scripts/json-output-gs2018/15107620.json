Activation of ErbB2 via homodimerization in a non-transformed human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, in basement membrane cultures leads to formation of proliferative structures that share properties with non-invasive early stage lesions. Recently, we have shown that activation of ErbB2 homodimers combined with expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta induces invasive and migratory activity in MCF-10A cells. In this system, migration requires inputs from numerous cellular pathways. We discuss this data and a model for migration induced by ErbB2 and TGF-beta. Concurrent studies by other groups have also shown that ErbB2 and TGF-beta can cooperate to increase metastatic and invasive behavior in murine mammary tumors. Here we discuss these studies and the potential implications of this research on breast cancer therapeutics.","title":"ErbB2 and TGF-beta: a cooperative role in mammary tumor progression?","pubmedId":"15107620"}
