We recently demonstrated PD-L1 expression in 20% of triple negative breast cancers suggesting that targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint may be an effective treatment modality in patients with this disease.","title":"Immune checkpoints: A therapeutic target in triple negative breast cancer.","pubmedId":"24843833"}
