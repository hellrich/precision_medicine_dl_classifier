All of these reported tumors lacked the NPM-ALK fusion transcript. There is controversy regarding the existence of ALK fusion-positive B-cell NHL, with many investigators contending that ALK fusions are expressed uniquely in T- or null-cell lymphomas. Here we describe 2 well-characterized cases of ALK-positive B-cell lymphoma expressing the NPM-ALK fusion. Both tumors occurred in pediatric patients and showed poor response to chemotherapy. Each had plasmablastic morphology, showed immunoglobulin A restriction, and was ALK positive and CD30- by immunohistochemistry. One tumor showed the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation by conventional cytogenetics. Both were positive for NPM-ALK by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Thus, ALK-positive plasmablastic B-cell lymphomas are more heterogeneous at the molecular level than previously recognized.","title":"ALK-positive plasmablastic B-cell lymphoma with expression of the NPM-ALK fusion transcript: report of 2 cases.","pubmedId":"12816858"}
