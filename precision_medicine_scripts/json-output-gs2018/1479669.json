Anesthesia was maintained with the combination of enflurane-N2O-vecuronium and cervical epidural block. Five minutes after the cessation of the longstanding operation, VT and circulatory collapse occurred. After administration of lidocaine and ephedrine, VPC and ST elevation were noted, followed by VT and Vf. Cardioversion successfully restored sinus rhythm with no ST change, suggesting an episode of coronary artery spasm. The possible inducing factors in this case were hypotension and acute imbalance in autonomic nervous systems caused by hypovolemia, hypothermia, insufficient anesthetic depth, loss of surgical stress, neostigmine and epidural block. The authors reviewed case reports on coronary spasm, especially looking for possible inducing factors of coronary artery spasm during anesthesia.","title":"[Coronary artery spasm immediately after the long-standing operation for cancer of the tongue].","pubmedId":"1479669"}
