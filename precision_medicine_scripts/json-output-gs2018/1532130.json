The detection limit of LC1 was 0.2 ng/tube and the optimal assay range was 1 to 100 ng/tube. The assay system enabled us to identify immunoreactive lipocortin 1-like molecules (IR-LC1) in human serum and plasma. Normal human serum and plasma IR-LC1 concentrations were 44.6 ng/ml for males and 43.1 ng/ml for females with no significant difference between both sexes. The age-related analysis among nine age groups from newborn to 69 years old revealed that the serum or plasma level was high in infants (77.5 ng/ml for newborn and 75.6 ng/ml for 1 month-1 year group), and the 40-year-old (52.2 ng/ml) and 50-year-old (51.3 ng/ml) groups. The major population of plasma IR-LC1 was of 70 kDa in size corresponding to that of the LC1 homodimer. The present enzyme immunoassay system is sufficiently sensitive for the clinical study of LC1 in human body fluids, tissues and organs.","title":"Identification of immuno-reactive lipocortin 1-like molecules in serum and plasma by an enzyme immunoassay for lipocortin 1.","pubmedId":"1532130"}
