In particular, neuroectoderm-derived cancers express characteristic ganglioside antigens, some of them have been used as tumor markers and/or target of immunotherapy. Molecules in the signaling pathway activated by gangliosides have been analyzed. Here, we reported results on the functions of molecules involved in the signaling pathway to enhance malignant properties of human melanomas under GD3 expression, and emphasized that those molecules including tumor-associated antigens can be targets of therapeutics for malignant melanomas.","title":"Molecules in the signaling pathway activated by gangliosides can be targets of therapeutics for malignant melanomas.","pubmedId":"18690647"}
