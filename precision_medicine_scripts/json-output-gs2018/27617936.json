Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a subset of NLCH in which patients experience bone pain with corresponding changes on imaging. In addition, these patients show other evidence of systemic involvement, which can also be identified with imaging. This disease can occasionally present with cutaneous findings. We present a case of generalized eruptive histiocytosis (GEH), misdiagnosed as ECD, found to have an NTRK1 gene rearrangement. This is the first report of an NTRK1 kinase fusion with NLCH. The implication is unclear and further studies are warranted. ","title":"Generalized eruptive histiocytosis associated with a novel fusion in LMNA-NTRK1.","pubmedId":"27617936"}
