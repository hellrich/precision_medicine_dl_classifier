In multivariate analysis, MFIR was an independent prognostic factor for response to induction chemotherapy (OR\u003d7.2, P\u003c0.00001), DFS (HR\u003d2.3, P\u003d0.004) and OS (HR\u003d2.2, P\u003d0.0005) with the main effect being in the 141 patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics. Among intermediate risk cytogenetics patients: MFIR+ outcomes were similar to unfavorable cytogenetic risk (CR, 53% vs. 52%, P\u003d1.0; OS, 11 vs. 9 months, P\u003d0.79). MFIR status can further stratify the prognostic risk for patients with or without FLT3 ITD mutation.\nMFIR has value in predicting outcomes including DFS and OS as well as induction failure. This is particularly true for patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics and when combined with assessment for the FLT3-ITD mutation.","title":"Identification of prognostic subgroups among acute myeloid leukemia patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics using a flow-cytometry-based assessment of ABC-transporter function.","pubmedId":"26002514"}
