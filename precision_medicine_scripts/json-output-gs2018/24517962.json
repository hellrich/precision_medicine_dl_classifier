In humans, hyperactive Hh signaling due to germline PATCHED1 (PTCH1) mutations has been linked to nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS). We report an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in a 16-month-old girl with NBCCS and review the literature on myogenic neoplasms in NBCCS, including 8 fetal rhabdomyomas and 3 rhabdomyosarcomas. Of note, 3 population studies, including 255 individuals with NBCCS aged 4 months to 87 years, did not identify any myogenic tumors. Thus, myogenic tumors in NBCCS are rare and include both rhabdomyosarcomas and fetal rhabdomyomas. ","title":"Myogenic tumors in nevoid Basal cell carcinoma syndrome.","pubmedId":"24517962"}
