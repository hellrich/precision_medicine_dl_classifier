Female carriers of the respective genotypes were under 1.98 (95% CI: 1.01-3.91), 2.87 (95% CI: 1.43-5.77), 3.48 (95% CI: 1.34-9.04), 4.23 (95% CI: 1.63-10.96), 6.04 (95% CI: 2.10-17.37), 25.61 (95% CI: 1.29-507.24), and 25.69 (95% CI: 1.11-593.59)-fold increased risks for CM than others, respectively. In men, the frequencies of BCL2 CA+AA (83.0% vs. 67.6%, P\u003d0.01) and MDM2 TG+GG plus BCL2 CA+AA (94.2% vs. 68.3%, P\u003d0.003) genotypes were higher in patients than in controls. Male carriers of the respective genotypes were under 2.43 (95% CI: 1.23-4.82) and 9.22 (95% CI: 2.16-39.31)-fold increased CM risks than others, respectively.\nThe data suggest for the first time that P53 Arg72Pro, MDM2 c.+309T\u003eG, BAX c.-248G\u003eA, and BCL2 c.-717C\u003eA polymorphisms, enrolled in apoptosis pathways, constitute distinct determinants of CM in women and men.","title":"Association between genetic polymorphisms in apoptosis-related genes and risk of cutaneous melanoma in women and men.","pubmedId":"24461648"}
