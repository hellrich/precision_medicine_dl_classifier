S-100B protein is a low molecular weight, acidic, calcium binding, cytoplasmatic protein. LDH was defined as the most important serum parameter in disseminated melanoma. The aim of the present study was to compare the prognostic values of serum 5-S-Cysteinyldopa, S-100B and LDH concentrations in Stage III-IV melanoma patients. Serum samples were taken from 179 Stage III-IV melanoma patients at diagnosis. Serum 5-S-CD concentrations were determined by HPLC, S-100B protein by immunoluminometric assay while LDH by UV kinetic method. The mean/median concentrations of LDH, S-100B protein and 5-S-CD in Stage III patients ranged around the normal level. In Stage IV, the markers ranked as S100B \u003d 5-S-CD \u003e LDH for sensitivity, S-100B \u003e LDH \u003e 5-S-CD for specificity and LDH \u003d S100B \u003d 5-S-CD for positive predictive value, respectively. Furthermore, mean marker concentrations of patients with progressive disease differed significantly from nonprogresssive cases (when staging categories have been disregarded). Survival analysis indicated, that the initially elevated LDH and S-100B level in Stage IV disease predicts comparably short survival. Results of our study suggest that these serum marker values correlate well with Stages and disease progression. In Stage IV melanoma, the markers had appropriate sensitivity, high specificity as well as important positive predictive value. Among the studied serum markers S-100B protein and LDH proved to be similarly reliable in respect to the clinical outcome.","title":"Comparison of prognostic significance of serum 5-S-Cysteinyldopa, LDH and S-100B protein in Stage III-IV malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"12515998"}
