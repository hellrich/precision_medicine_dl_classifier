Cerebellar GBMs are not yet completely understood also as far as the prognosis. We report a case of cerebellar GBM in a 27-year-old woman. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 3x3.6 cm-sized, ill-defined, heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left cerebellum. GBM was histologically confirmed following radical surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy was subsequently administrated. She has no evidence of recurrence and is in good clinical conditions up-to date, three years after surgery.","title":"Long-term survival in cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme.
