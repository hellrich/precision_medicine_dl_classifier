Its role in pathogenesis or progression is under investigation.\nPatients who underwent thyroidectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy for papillary thyroid cancer were accrued. BRAF mutation was assessed in primary tumors and matched sentinel lymph nodes by a quantitative real-time PCR assay.\nTissue specimens from 103 consecutive patients were evaluated. BRAF mutation of the primary tumor was detected in 34 (33%) patients. In 26 of 34 (76%) patients with BRAF mutation, concomitant lymph node metastasis was detected. On the contrary, in 69 patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors, only 12 (17%) patients had lymph node metastasis (chi, P \u003c 0.0001). BRAF mutation was detected in 20 of 26 (77%) lymph node metastases matched to BRAF mutation-positive primary tumors; it was not detected in lymph node metastases matched to BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors. Univariate analysis identified age, stage, tumor size, and BRAF mutation as prognostic factors for lymph node metastasis. In multivariate analysis, only BRAF mutation remained a significant prognostic factor for lymph node metastasis (odds ratio \u003d 10.8, 95% confidence interval, 3.5-34.0, P \u003c 0.0001).\nBRAF mutation may be a key genetic factor for the metastatic progression of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The study demonstrates that this gene mutation is a significant risk factor for locoregional lymph node metastasis and has potential utility as a surrogate marker.","title":"Lymphatic mapping establishes the role of BRAF gene mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17060774"}
