Whether the presence of GAs may guide treatment (trt) decision regardless of histological subtype remains unclear.  Methods:  Pts with advanced solid and hematologic cancers were offered a genetic profiling of their tumor. DNA extracted from archival or freshly collected tumor samples was analyzed by sequencing of 59 cancer-related genes (NGS, Ion Torrent PGM system) and whole genome CGH array (Agilent platform). A multidisciplinary panel of clinicians and scientists reviewed results to determine the relevance of GAs and recommended molecular targeted therapies (MTT) when relevant.  Results:  From March to October 2013, 431 pts from a single center were consented and 283 (66%) had their tumor analyzed, either by NGS+CGH (186 pts, 66%), NGS alone (86, 30%) or CGH alone (11, 4%). 137 (48%) had at least one actionable target (AT) with a recommended MTT: 20% were breast cancers, 17% head and neck, 15% lung, 9% sarcoma, 8% colon and 31% other tumor types. NGS was conclusive for 132 pts, identifying actionable mutations (hot spot or described in COSMIC database) mainly in PIK3CA (15% of pts), EGFR (9%), MET (4%), MTOR (4%), ALK (4%), PTEN (4%), ERBB2 (3%), BRAF (2%) (median nb of mutations/pt: 1 [range: 0-11]). Main ATs identified with CGH (n\u003d105 pts) were amplifications of CCND1 (17%), FGFR1 (11%), MDM2 (7%), EGFR (5%), ERBB2 (5%), CDK4 (4%), CDK6 (3%), homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (21%) and PTEN (5%) (median nb of copy number variations/pt: 1 [0-6]). 19/137 pts (14%) have so far received an MTT, mainly mTOR inhibitors (7 pts, 37%), ALK/MET inhibitors, anti-HER2, FGFR inhibitors or anti-VEGF (2 pts each, 10%). Best responses were PR (2/19, 10%), SD (6/19, 32 %), PD (9/19, 47%) and not evaluable in 2 pts. Median trt duration was 2.2 months [0.87.5] (Data, censored on December 1st2013, will be updated).  Conclusions:  Systematic tumor profiling is feasible in routine practice, highly attractive for pts with advanced malignancies and identifies ATs in nearly 50% of the pts.
