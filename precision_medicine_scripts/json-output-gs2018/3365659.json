There also appears to be an association between HIV and an aggressive form of Hodgkin\u0027s disease. In addition, there is a spectrum of HIV-related central and peripheral neurologic syndromes. This article documents four patients with HIV-associated lymphoma who presented with peripheral neurologic syndromes as part of their neoplastic process. Autopsy results obtained from two of these patients showed direct nerve infiltration by lymphoma. All patients had an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). It is recommended that HIV-related lymphoma be considered in a high-risk patient who presents with a peripheral neurologic syndrome especially if there is an elevated serum LDH.","title":"Human immunodeficiency virus-related lymphoreticular malignancies and peripheral neurologic disease.
