We characterized the incidence of CNS involvement, risk factors and outcome in a large single institution dataset of PTCL.  Methods:   Retrospective review of the T-cell lymphoma database at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  We identified 232 patients with any subtype of PTCL between 1994-2011 with a minimum 6 months of follow-up or an event defined as relapse or death. We excluded indolent forms of cutaneous T cell lymphoma.  Results:  Histologies included PTCL-NOS (31%), angioimmunoblastic (16.8%), anaplastic (ALCL), ALK negative (12%), ALCL, ALK positive (6%), extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (7.3%), adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (7.3%), and transformed MF (8.6%). Median age was 58 years with 59.9% men. CNS disease was found in 17 patients (7.32%).  8 (47%) had pathologic confirmation and 7 (41.2%) were clinically diagnosed. Two had other diagnoses at biopsy: DLBCL and glioblastoma.   Median time to CNS involvement was 2.33 months (range, 0.16 to 103.1). CNS prophylaxis was given to 24 (10.34%), primarily intrathecal methotrexate. There was no difference in CNS involvement in patients who received prophylaxis vs. those who did not: 3/24 (12.5%) vs. 12/208 (5.77%) (p\u003d0.192) respectively.  Univariate analysis identified: stage III-IV (p\u003d0.03), bone marrow involvement (p\u003d0.018), \u003e1 extranodal site (p\u003c0.001), and ATLL vs. all other subtypes, 23.5% vs. 6.4% (p\u003d0.003) as risk factors for CNS disease. On multivariate analysis, \u003e1 extranodal site (p\u003d0.004) and high intermediate (H-I) and high (H) IPI (IPI 3-5 \u0026 4-5) were predictive for CNS involvement (p\u003c0.05). The median survival of patients with CNS involvement was 2.628 months.  Conclusions:  Despite high relapse rates, PTCL carries a low risk of CNS involvement other than the ATLL subtype. As with other aggressive lymphomas, survival of patients with CNS involvement is poor and risk factors include: \u003e1 extra nodal site and H-I-H IPI. In this dataset, prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy does not appear to reduce the risk of CNS disease.","title":"Central nervous system involvement in T-cell lymphomas: A single center experience.","pubmedId":"ASCO_98575-114"}
