The case of a 41-year-old Caucasian male is reported who developed superficially spreading melanoma on the skin of his trunk 9 years after the enucleation of his right eye because of a fusiform melanoma of the choroidal membrane. Staging revealed a further malignancy: hemangiopericytoma inside and adjacent to the left psoas muscle. Both theoretical and practical conclusions to be drawn from the case are discussed.","title":"Coincidence of primary malignant melanoma of skin and eye.
