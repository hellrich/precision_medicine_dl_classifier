MNF interferes also with pro-oncogenic signaling induced by the orphan G-protein-linked receptor, GPR55, in human HepG2 hepatocarcinoma and PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells. Here, we utilized a number of cellular and biochemical techniques to investigate the anti-tumorigenic potential of MNF in a panel of human melanoma cell lines. Cell migration, which was performed using scratch wound healing assay, demonstrated the ability of MNF to dose-dependently reduce the motility of EGFR-expressing UACC-647 and M93-047 cell lines in a biphasic (IC50 \u003d 0.32 nM and 1.48 M) and sigmoidal (IC50 \u003d 7.14 nM) fashion, respectively. In contrast, EGFR-negative UACC-903 cells were unresponsive to MNF. The proliferation rate of UACC-647 cells was diminished by 38  3.7% in the presence of MNF, with an IC50 of 136 nM. Pharmacological inhibition of 2AR with the selective antagonist ICI-118,551 (50 nM) did not confer protection against the actions of MNF on cell motility and proliferation. U-shaped dose-response curves, with a nadir at 1 nM, were observed when the levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK were determined in MNF-treated UACC-647 cells. A similar dose-response relationship was observed with the 2AR agonists, epinephrine and (R,R\u0027)-fenoterol, and cell pretreatment with 50 nM ICI-118,551 abolished MNF-evoked drop in phospho-ERK levels. However, MNF markedly increased inhibitory phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) on Thr56, which was accompanied by global defect in protein biosynthesis as revealed by pulse-labeling experiments with [35S]-methionine. We conclude that the anti-tumorigenic functions of MNF most likely reflect dual effects of MNF through interaction with different receptors in melanoma.
