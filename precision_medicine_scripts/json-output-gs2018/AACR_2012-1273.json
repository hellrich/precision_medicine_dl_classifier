It tends to grow slowly but is associated with a poor prognosis when metastasis happens. To better understand basic mechanisms of tumor development and identify potential new biomarkers of PTC, we examined protein expression profiling in clinical PTC tissue and matched normal thyroid tissue using fluorescence two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). To identify the proteins, peptide mass fingerprinting via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was carried out. Using these strategies, 85 up-regulated or down-regulated proteins were found in PTC. Imaging software determined 26 proteins to be differentially expressed at the two-fold (or greater) level. Among them, Cathepsin B and Lamin A/C were selected for further analyses. Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining showed a higher expression of these proteins in clinical PTC tissue compared to normal thyroid tissue. We are presently investigating those roles in PTC. Proteomic analysis of PTC using 2D-DIGE and mass spectrometry could provide novel potential biomarkers and insights into global pathophysiologic changes in PTC.","title":"Identification of differentially expressed proteins in human papillary thyroid carcinoma using proteomic analysis","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1273"}
