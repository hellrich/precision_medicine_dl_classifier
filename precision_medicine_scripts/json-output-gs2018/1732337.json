A total of 1.2 million people were surveyed for a history of cancer and followed up for 6 years for the development of any cancer. In total, 2780 white persons had a history of malignant melanoma or developed malignant melanoma during the study period. The controls were age-, sex-, and geographically matched white persons selected from the remaining people enrolled.\nBoth men and women were shown to have a statistically significant increase in the relative risk for malignant melanoma with increasing education level (p less than 0.001 and p \u003d 0.001, respectively). This relation was more striking in men when the relative risk with 95% confidence interval was calculated by sex for each education level.\nAmericans with more formal education are at greater risk for malignant melanoma than those with less education.","title":"Level of education and the risk of malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"1732337"}
