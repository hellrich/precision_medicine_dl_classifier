We report about a 58-year-old patient with a rarely described, polypoid variant of this tumor. Polypoid basal cell carcinoma differs clinically from other variants by being exophytic and pedunculated and, histologically, the tumor aggregations are restricted only to the polypoid part.","title":"[Polypoid basal cell carcinoma].","pubmedId":"15021934"}
