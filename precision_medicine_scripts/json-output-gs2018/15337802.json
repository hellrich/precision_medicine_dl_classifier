In this study, we sought to combine our data sets to shed light on the similarities and differences between these tumor types.\nMicroarray data from six PTCs, nine FTCs, and 13 normal thyroid samples were normalized to remove interlaboratory variability and then analyzed by unsupervised clustering, t test, and by comparison of absolute and change calls. Expression changes in four genes not previously implicated in thyroid carcinogenesis were verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on these same samples, together with eight additional FTC tumors.\nPTCs showed two distinct groups of genes that were either over- or underexpressed compared with normal thyroid, whereas the predominant changes in FTCs were of decreased expression. Five genes could collectively distinguish the two tumor types. PTCs showed overexpression of CITED1, claudin-10 (CLDN10), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) but showed no change in expression of caveolin-1 (CAV1) or -2 (CAV2); conversely, FTCs did not express CLDN10 and had decreased expression of IGFBP6 and/or CAV1 and CAV2.\nPTC and FTC show distinctive microarray expression profiles, suggesting that either they have different molecular origins or they diverge distinctly from a common origin. Furthermore, if verified in a larger series of tumors, these genes could, in combination with known tumor-specific chromosome translocations, form the basis of a valuable diagnostic tool.","title":"Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas show distinctly different microarray expression profiles and can be distinguished by a minimum of five genes.","pubmedId":"15337802"}
