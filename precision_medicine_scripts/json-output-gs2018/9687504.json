We have previously shown that enforced c-KIT expression in highly metastatic cells inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice. Furthermore, the ligand for c-KIT, SCF, induces apoptosis in human melanoma cells expressing c-KIT under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Here we show that loss of c-KIT expression in highly metastatic cells correlates with loss of expression of the transcription factor AP-2. The c-KIT promoter contains three binding sites for AP-2 and EMSA gels demonstrated that AP-2 protein binds directly to the c-KIT promoter. Transfection of wild-type AP-2 into c-KIT-negative A375SM melanoma cells activated a c-KIT promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene, while expression of a dominant-negative AP-2B in c-KIT-positive Mel-501 cells inhibited its activation. Endogenous c-KIT mRNA and expression of proteins were upregulated in AP-2-transfected cells, but not in control cells. In addition, re-expression of AP-2 in A375SM cells suppressed their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice. These results indicate that the expression of c-KIT is highly regulated by AP-2 and that enforced AP-2 expression suppresses tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of human melanoma cells, possibly through c-KIT transactivation and SCF-induced apoptosis. Therefore, loss of AP-2 expression might be a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma.","title":"Loss of AP-2 results in downregulation of c-KIT and enhancement of melanoma tumorigenicity and metastasis.","pubmedId":"9687504"}
