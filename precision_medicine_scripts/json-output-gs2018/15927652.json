Photodynamic therapy,brachytherapy, and esophageal stenting all represent viable options for the palliation of malignant dysphagia. Characterization of the patients and their tumors allows individualization of the treatment and the selection of the optimal treatment for each individual patient. Institutional resources and expertise also are significant factors in treatment. Further comparative studies may help further delineate the relative merits of these treatments and the optimal treatment of patients with malignant obstruction.","title":"Esophageal palliation--photodynamic therapy/stents/brachytherapy.","pubmedId":"15927652"}
