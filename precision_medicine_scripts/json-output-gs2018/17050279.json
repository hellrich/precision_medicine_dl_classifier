Immunoanalysis was correlated with cell types, largest tumor diameter, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, mitosis, nuclear grade, and extrascleral extension/liver metastasis. In group C (n \u003d 6), tumors with liver metastasis showed higher expressions of IGF-1R (p \u003d 0.0001), c-Fos (p \u003d 0.004), and c-Jun (p \u003d 0.018) compared with the tumors with no extension/extrascleral extension without liver metastasis (groups A-45 and B-9). Further studies are required to elucidate the role of sequential upregulation of these proteins and the transcriptional activity of c-Fos and c-Jun in uveal melanomas with liver metastasis","title":"Expression of insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), c-Fos, and c-Jun in uveal melanoma: an immunohistochemical study.","pubmedId":"17050279"}
