Elevated levels of IGF binding capacity in serum of lung cancer patients were also reported. The function and tissue specificity of IGFBP are still obscure but they are probably local regulators of IGF action. Here we show the expression of IGFBP-4 transcripts in 11/11 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, in nine out of 11 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, in 11/11 lung tumour specimens (10 derived from patients with NSCLC and one from SCLC origin) and in normal lung. In addition we isolated IGFBP-5 cDNA from lambda gt10 libraries of SCLC cell lines. With this IGFBP-5 cDNA we detected transcripts of different lengths in seven out of 11 SCLC cell lines, in 11/11 lung cancer specimens but only in one out of 11 NSCLC cell lines and in normal lung. IGFBP-6 was not detected in northern analysis of any tested SCLC cell line but it was expressed in nine out of 11 NSCLC cell lines and in nine out of 11 human lung cancer specimens and in normal lung.","title":"Molecular cloning of IGFBP-5 from SCLC cell lines and expression of IGFBP-4, IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-6 in lung cancer cell lines and primary tumours.","pubmedId":"7692907"}
