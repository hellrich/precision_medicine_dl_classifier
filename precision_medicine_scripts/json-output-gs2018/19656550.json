The data were compared with status of MYCN, 11q, 17q, and 1p36. We observed ALK aberrations (amplification, 1 of 45; gain, 15 of 45 and loss/imbalance, 11 of 45) in a total of 27 (60%) of 45 neuroblastomas. Synchronic MYCN and ALK aberrations accounted for 23 of 45 (51%) tumors; however, MYCN alterations were also detected in 11 (60%) of 18 tumors without ALK aberrations. Our data suggest that copy number aberrations of the ALK gene is a frequent genetic event in the development of neuroblastomas. In addition, no correlation was observed between ALK aberrations and alterations of 11q, 17q, and 1p36.","title":"Aberrant copy numbers of ALK gene is a frequent genetic alteration in neuroblastomas.","pubmedId":"19656550"}
