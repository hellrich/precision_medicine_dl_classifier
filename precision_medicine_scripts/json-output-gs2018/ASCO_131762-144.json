However, prospective use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical samples for multiplex copy number and somatic mutation genotyping in clinical trials is not yet routinely performed. We evaluated feasibility and implemented a combined copy number and clinical research mutation-testing program (PROFILE) in a CLIA-certified laboratory.    Methods:   We collected molecular profiling results from clinical and clinical research testing on 250 GBM patients from the Brigham and Womens Hospital Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics. These data included array comparative genomic hybridization (OncoCopy, n\u003d250), mass spectrometry-based mutation genotyping (OncoMap, n\u003d86), and targeted cancer exome sequencing of 275 known cancer genes (OncoPanel, n\u003d98).   Results:    We successfully reported OncoCopy profiles for 42 relevant loci in 97% of samples and demonstrated that analysis of 250 GBMs reliably detected amplifications or structural variations in common drug targets for clinical trials (EGFR, EGFRvIII, MET, MDM2, MDM4, PDGFRA, CDK4, and CDK6) at expected frequencies. OncoMap results for 86 GBMs revealed recurrent mutations in IDH1, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PIK3R1 while less frequent mutations were detected in tumor suppressor genes TP53, PTEN and RB1.  OncoPanel results were reported on \u003e90% of patients and comprehensively detected known mutations of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic relevance (e.g. IDH1 p.R132H, BRAF p.V600E). Tumor suppressor gene mutations and variants were robustly detected allowing for integrative OncoCopy and OncoPanel reporting in 65% of cases.    Conclusions:   These complementary clinical assays allowed efficient and reliable identification of diagnostic aberrations that serve as clinically actionable drug targets, which could be incorporated into genomically stratified multi-arm clinical trial design for GBM.","title":"Integrative whole-genome copy number analysis and mutation profiling of FFPE brain tumor specimens and potential in designing multi-arm clinical trials.","pubmedId":"ASCO_131762-144"}
