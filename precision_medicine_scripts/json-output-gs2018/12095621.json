In the present study, nine NF1 variants were quantified by real-time PCR in various human tissues. Some of these variants were expressed at low to moderate low levels and possible implications of these findings are discussed. Interestingly, two variants (NF1-DeltaE4b and NF1-DeltaE43) were shown to be highly expressed in specific tissues. NF1-DeltaE43 lacks a nuclear targeting sequence and might be functionally different from full-length NF1. These novel NF1 splice variants might expand our understanding of the role of neurofibromin.","title":"Quantification of NF1 transcripts reveals novel highly expressed splice variants.","pubmedId":"12095621"}
