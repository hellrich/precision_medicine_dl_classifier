The curative rate and adverse effects were observed in these patients.\nOut of 7 RR-AML patients after treatment, 5 patients achieved complete remission (CR), 2 patients achieved partial remission (PR), and the overall response rate (ORR) after one course of therapy was 100%. No severe bleeding, nausea, vomiting and other side effects were found in these patients.\nSorafenib combined with low dose cytarabine can effectively induce the remission of FLT3(+) RR-AML patients, and is worth for further clinical trails to verify its safty and efficiency.","title":"[Clinical Efficacy of Sorafenib Combined with Low Dose Cytarabine for Treating Patients with FLT3+ Relapsed and Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia].","pubmedId":"27150998"}
