A functional link between the two predictive factors has not been previously shown. Here, using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to block ErbB2 signaling, we show that ErbB2 regulates survivin protein expression in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Selective knockdown of ErbB2 using small interfering RNA markedly reduced survivin protein, resulting in apoptosis of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines such as BT474. Alternatively, inhibition of ErbB2 signaling using lapatinib (GW572016), a reversible small-molecule inhibitor of ErbB1/ErbB2 tyrosine kinases, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, leads to marked inhibition of survivin protein with subsequent apoptosis. The effect of lapatinib on survivin seems to be predominantly posttranslational, mediated by ubiquitin-proteosome degradation as lactacystin, a proteosome inhibitor, reverses these effects. Furthermore, lapatinib down-regulated the expression of His-tagged survivin, which was under the transcriptional control of a heterologous promoter, providing additional evidence supporting a posttranslational mechanism of regulation. In contrast, trastuzumab and gefitinib failed to down-regulate survivin in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Importantly, the clinical relevance of these findings was illustrated in patients with ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer whose clinical response to lapatinib was associated with marked inhibition of survivin in their tumors. These findings shed new light on the mechanism by which ErbB2 overexpression protects against apoptotic stimuli in breast cancer and identifies therapeutic interventions to improve clinical outcomes in these aggressive tumors.","title":"Regulation of survivin by ErbB2 signaling: therapeutic implications for ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers.","pubmedId":"16452223"}
