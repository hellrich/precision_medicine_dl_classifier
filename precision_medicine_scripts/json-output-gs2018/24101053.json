We investigated whether dual inhibition of MET/EGFR results in clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC.\nPatients with recurrent NSCLC were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one to receive onartuzumab plus erlotinib or placebo plus erlotinib; crossover was allowed at progression. Tumor tissue was required to assess MET status by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Coprimary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET-positive (MET IHC diagnostic positive) populations; additional end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, and safety.\nThere was no improvement in PFS or OS in the ITT population (n \u003d 137; PFS hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; P \u003d .69; OS HR, 0.80; P \u003d .34). MET-positive patients (n \u003d 66) treated with erlotinib plus onartuzumab showed improvement in both PFS (HR, .53; P \u003d .04) and OS (HR, .37; P \u003d .002). Conversely, clinical outcomes were worse in MET-negative patients treated with onartuzumab plus erlotinib (n \u003d 62; PFS HR, 1.82; P \u003d .05; OS HR, 1.78; P \u003d .16). MET-positive control patients had worse outcomes versus MET-negative control patients (n \u003d 62; PFS HR, 1.71; P \u003d .06; OS HR, 2.61; P \u003d .004). Incidence of peripheral edema was increased in onartuzumab-treated patients.\nOnartuzumab plus erlotinib was associated with improved PFS and OS in the MET-positive population. These results combined with the worse outcomes observed in MET-negative patients treated with onartuzumab highlight the importance of diagnostic testing in drug development.","title":"Randomized phase II trial of Onartuzumab in combination with erlotinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24101053"}
