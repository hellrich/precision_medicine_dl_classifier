Various SN tumour burden parameters are assessed to determine the heterogeneity of SN-positivity. The aim of the present study was to validate the prognostic significance of various SN tumour burden micromorphometric features and classification schemes in a large cohort of SN-positive melanoma patients.\nIn 1539 SN-positive patients treated between 1993 and 2008 at 11 melanoma treatment centres in Europe and Australia, indices of SN tumour burden (intranodal location, tumour penetrative depth (TPD) and maximum size of SN tumour deposits) were evaluated.\nNon-subcapsular location, increasing TPD and increasing maximum size were all predictive factors for non-SN (NSN) status and were independently associated with poorer melanoma-specific survival (MSS). Patients with subcapsular micrometastases \u003c0.1mm in maximum dimension had the lowest frequency of NSN metastasis (5.5%). Despite differences in SN biopsy protocols and clinicopathologic features of the patient cohorts (between centres), most SN parameters remained predictive in individual centre populations. Maximum SN tumour size\u003e1mm was the most reliable and consistent parameter independently associated with higher non-SN-positivity, poorer disease-free survival (DFS) and poorer MSS.\nIn this large retrospective, multicenter cohort study, several parameters of SN tumour burden including intranodal location, TPD and maximum size provided prognostic information, but their prognostic significance varied considerably between the different centres. This could be due to sample size limitations or to differences in SN detection, removal and examination techniques.","title":"The prognostic significance of sentinel node tumour burden in melanoma patients: an international, multicenter study of 1539 sentinel node-positive melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"24074765"}
