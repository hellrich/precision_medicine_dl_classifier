Methods:  22 localized advanced breast cancer patients were treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (adriamycin: 17, trastuzumab: 5). We concerned HER2/neu positive breast cancer when IHC3+ or FISH amplified. Serum HER2/neu levels were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay (ADVIA centaurTM system) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and before operation. The cutoff value was 10.2 mg/ml according to previous study. We considered clinical outcomes as short term disease free survival and disease free interval for investigating of the role of serum HER2/neu in a prediction of clinical outcomes.  Results:  Mean of serum HER2/neu before chemotherapy was 15.8 1.6ng/ml, and that after chemotherapy was 10.6  0.38ng/ml. Partial response (PR) was 17 patients and complete response (CR) was 5 patients. Mean of change in serum HER2/neu was 5.1 2.1ng/ml, and change of serum HER2/neu in CR group was higher than PR group (13.26  14.1ng/ml; 2.743.2ng/ml,p\u003d0.008). Change of serum HER2/neu in trastuzumab group was higher than that in adriamycin group (12.814.5ng/ml; 2.83.2ng/ml, p\u003d0.012). In adriamycin group, CR was not correlated with change of serum HER-2/neu (PR: 3.033.3NG/ML; CR: 1.651.62ng/ml, p\u003d0.58). In trastuzumab group, it also was not correlated (PR: 0.6 1.13ng/ml; CR: 21.0 13.2ng/ml, p\u003d0.083). CR was correlated with change of serum HER2/neu, initial serum HER2/neu, and treatment group (T\u003eA, p\u003d0.024). Mean follow up duration was 41months, the change of serum HER2/neu before and after chemotherapy was not correlated with disease recurrence (NED: 8.6 11.4ng/ml, REC: 2.1 0.65ng/ml, p\u003d0.082). The change of serum HER2/neu was not correlated with disease free interval (p\u003d0.07).  Conclusions:    The change in serum HER2/neu was associated with pathologic response with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but not specific in the chemoregimen. The bigger change of serum HER2/neu, the better prognosis was estimated, even a limited study, but it needs further studies.","title":"Correlation between change of serum HER2/neu before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and clinical outcomes in advanced breast cancers.","pubmedId":"ASCO_81663-102"}
