The rate of p16 gene mutation in the other three groups was 7.1%, 7.4% and 4.9%. The detection rate of mutation was significantly higher in the highly purified group than in the other three groups (P \u003c 0.01), but it was not significantly different in the other three groups (P \u003e 0.05).\np16 gene deletion and point mutation exist in primary breast cancer. Homozygous deletion and small fragment deletion may be an important mechanism of inactivation in human breast neoplasm. Purified cancer cells will enhance the detection rate.","title":"[p16 gene deletion and point mutation in highly purified fresh breast neoplasm].","pubmedId":"11831977"}
