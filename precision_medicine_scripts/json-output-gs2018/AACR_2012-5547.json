In the present study, we first administered A1-R to nude with subcutaneous murine colon cancer Colon-26 which expressed red fluorescent protein (RFP). S. typhimurium A1-R (1107 cfu) was administered intravenously (i.v.) or intratumorally (i.t.) to the subcutaneous tumor as a positive control. The size of tumor was measured by weekly fluorescence imaging. Both i.v.- and i.t.-treated mice had smaller tumors and survived longer (p\u003c0.05) compared to the control group treated with PBS. When S. typhimurium A1-R was administered orally to nude mice with orthotopically-transplanted Colon-26 RFP, tumor growth was inhibited (p\u003c0.05) and animals survived longer than untreated controls (p\u003c0.05). Furthermore, orally-treated mice had no observable side effects suggesting oral delivery of tumor-targeting S. typhimurium A1-R is a promising route for bacterial therapy of cancer.","title":"Oral delivery of tumor-targeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R is effective therapeutically","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5547"}
