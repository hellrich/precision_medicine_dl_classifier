The surgical-pathological TNM-stage is known as the most reliable prognostic factor for survival in patients with lung cancer.\nWe present 440 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, radically operated in the Clinic of Thoracic and abdominal surgery of University Hospital \"St.George\" - Plovdiv for the period 01.01.1997 - 01.09.2004 - 378 men (85.91%) and 62 women (14.09%), age range 23-82 years.\nThe mean time of survival according to the stage is as follows: IA - 77 months, IB - 67, IIA - 55, IIB - 42, IIIA - 33 IIIB - 14, IV - 27 months.\nThe stage of the disease is an important prognostic factor for patients with lung cancer. We found the lowest survival in stage IIIB. For selected patients in stage IV, the operative treatment leads to good results.","title":"[Stage of disease as a prognostic factor in radically operated patients with non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"21972687"}
