The putative tumor suppressor gene, p16 is frequently altered in certain neoplasms and many cell lines. The potential role of INK4 CDKIs in pathogenesis of prostate carcinoma was studied.\nThirty-two primary prostate cancer samples and two prostate cancer cell lines were examined for alterations of the p16, p15, p18, and p19 genes by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and Southern blot analysis.\nAlteration of the p16 gene was found in one of 32 primary prostate cancer samples by PCR-SSCP. DNA sequencing of the sample showed a 24-basepair insertion in exon 1 of the p16 gene at codon 11. No other mutations were found in p15, p18, or p19 genes by PCR-SSCP. Furthermore, none of the p16, p15, p18, or p19 genes had alterations by Southern blot analysis.\nThese results indicate that structural abnormalities of the INK4 CDKIs is a rare event in prostate carcinoma, and the loss of function of INK4 CDKIs by other mechanisms, such as methylation should be further explored.","title":"Molecular analysis of the INK4 family of genes in prostate carcinomas.","pubmedId":"9112579"}
