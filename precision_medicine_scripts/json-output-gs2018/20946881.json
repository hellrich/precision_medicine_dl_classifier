Our aim is to assess whether IDH mutations were presented in Chinese patients with various hematological disorders. In this study, we screened the IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in a cohort of 456 Chinese patients with various hematological malignancies and disorders. We found three missense (p.R132C, p.R132G, and p.I99M; occurred in five patients) and one silent mutation (c.315C\u003eT; occurred in two patients) in the IDH1 gene and two missense mutations (p.R140Q and p.R172K; occurred in four AML patients) and one silent mutation (c.435G\u003eA) in the IDH2 gene. Except for one non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patient harboring IDH1 mutation p.R132C, all IDH1 and IDH2 missense mutations were observed in patients with AML. Intriguingly, the IDH2 mutation p.R140Q and novel IDH1 mutation p.I99M co-occurred in a 75-year-old patient with AML developed from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The frequency of IDH1 and IDH2 missense mutations in Chinese AML patients reached 5.9% and 8.3%, respectively. Our results supported the recent findings that IDH gene mutations were common in AML. Conversely, IDH mutations were rather rare in Chinese patients with other types of hematological disorders.","title":"IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are frequent in Chinese patients with acute myeloid leukemia but rare in other types of hematological disorders.","pubmedId":"20946881"}
