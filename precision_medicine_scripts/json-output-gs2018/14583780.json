Amplifying cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA transcripts using real-time TaqMan PCR made it possible to quantify axillary metastatic burden. Metastases in 358 axillary lymph nodes obtained from 23 breast cancers of 22 patients were investigated by conventional haematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E) staining, immunohistochemical staining and quantitative RT-PCR assay. The detection rates of axillary lymph node metastasis using H\u0026E staining, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR assay were 4.5, 5.9 and 13.1%, respectively. RT-PCR assay was the most sensitive of these three methods for detecting lymph node metastases. Cytokeratin 19 mRNA expression values of both histologically and immunohistochemically positive lymph nodes were significantly higher than the values for lymph nodes judged to be negative by both histological and immunohistochemical methods (P\u003c0.0001), and those of histologically negative, but immunohistochemically positive lymph nodes were significantly higher than the values for lymph nodes judged to be negative by both histological and immunohistochemical methods (P\u003c0.0001). Furthermore, metastatic rates of sentinel nodes were higher than the rates of nonsentinel lymph nodes as measured by all three methods. These results indicate that quantitative RT-PCR assay is a sensitive and reliable method for detecting lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, quantification of metastases in sentinel lymph nodes by quantitative RT-PCR assay may be useful to assess the entire axillary burden of breast cancer patients.","title":"Quantitative evaluation of metastases in axillary lymph nodes of breast cancer.","pubmedId":"14583780"}
