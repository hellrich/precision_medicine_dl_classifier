There is an urgent need to find more effective targets for early diagnosis and therapeutics. UbcH10 is an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme with a high expression reported in some cancers. Several gastric tumor cell lines with high or low expression of UbcH10 were exploited to study the role of UbcH10 in gastric cancer. Knocking down of UbcH10 expression using siRNA in high expressing gastric cancer cell lines resulted in reduced proliferation, increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis and reduced serum-induced ERK, Akt and p38 phosphorylation signaling. In agreement, overexpression of UbcH10 expression in low-expression gastric cancer cell lines led to enhanced cell proliferation, resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Most importantly, IHC analyses showed that the UbcH10 protein expressed at a high level in patient gastric cancer tissues, but not in adjacent mesenchyme tissues. These data suggest that UbcH10 may promote gastric cancer growth and can serve as a biomarker for diagnosis or target for new therapeutics in gastric cancer.","title":"UbcH10 may represent a potential marker of gastric carcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4929"}
