BRAF(V600E) mutation in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) could represent an appropriate marker for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).\nOur aim is to investigate the role of BRAF(V600E)-mutated allele in cfDNA as a marker for the diagnosis and follow-up of PTC.\nBRAF(V600E) allele was detected and quantified by an allele-specific real-time quantitative PCR assay in plasma from 103 patients affected by nodular goiter. As control populations, we enrolled 49 healthy subjects and 16 patients with non-nodular thyroid diseases.\nThe percentage of circulating BRAF(V600E) was significantly different between patients and controls and throughout different cytological categories of ultrasound-assisted fine-needle aspiration. Patients with a histopathological diagnosis of PTC showed a higher percentage of circulating BRAF(V600E) (P \u003d .035) compared to those with benign histology. In 19 patients, a second blood draw, taken 3-6 months after surgery, showed a lower percentage of BRAF(V600E) in cfDNA than the presurgical sample (P \u003c .001). The diagnostic performance of circulating BRAF(V600E) was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis resulting in an area under the curve of 0.797. A cutoff value was chosen corresponding to maximum specificity (65%) and sensitivity (80%). On this basis, we evaluated the predictive value of BRAF(V600E) in Thy 3 patients with a resulting positive predictive value of 33% and a negative predictive value of 80%.\nThe results of the present study provide encouraging data supporting the possibility to take advantage of circulating BRAF(V600E) in the management of PTC.","title":"Circulating BRAFV600E in the diagnosis and follow-up of differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"23788690"}
