The MUC1 antigen was identified in all squamous cell and sebaceous gland carcinomas, but not in basal cell carcinoma or the benign tumors. The Tn antigen was expressed in all the sebaceous gland, half of the squamous cell, and only rarely in the basal cell carcinomas. The STn antigen was expressed in all seborrheic keratosis and in the majority of squamous cell carcinomas, but only rarely in sebaceous gland and basal cell carcinomas. Eyelid tumors are frequently associated with apomucin and mucin-carbohydrate antigens: the MUC1 glycoprotein appears to be related to the malignant potential of eyelid tumors, and may be a useful marker for the differential diagnosis of invasive tumors, including sebaceous gland and squamous cell carcinomas.","title":"Glycopathological study of eyelid tumors and pseudotumors.","pubmedId":"9509302"}
