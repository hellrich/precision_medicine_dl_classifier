BRAF acts as direct effector of RAS and through the activation of MEK, promotes tumour growth and survival. Approximately, 8% of cancers carry a BRAF mutation. However, the prevalence of this mutation varies significantly across different tumour types. There has been increasing interest in the specific role of BRAF mutations in cancer growth and progression over the last few years, especially since the clinical introduction of therapeutic BRAF inhibitors. In this paper we review the published literature on the role of BRAF mutations in melanoma and colorectal cancer, focusing on similarities and differences of BRAF mutations with respect to frequency, demographics, risk factors, mutation-associated clinico-pathologic and molecular features and clinical implications between these two diseases.","title":"BRAF mutations in melanoma and colorectal cancer: a single oncogenic mutation with different tumour phenotypes and clinical implications.","pubmedId":"23246082"}
