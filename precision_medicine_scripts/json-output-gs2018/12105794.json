We here report the case of a 61-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma to the trachea occurring 2 years after the excision of a right shoulder skin nodule. The patient underwent argon plasma coagulation (APC) recanalization of the malignant airway under flexible bronchoscopy, which led to the stable resolution of the respiratory symptoms. We also discuss the possible palliative therapeutic options for such metastases, including the APC technique.","title":"Flexible argon plasma coagulation treatment of obstructive tracheal metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"12105794"}
