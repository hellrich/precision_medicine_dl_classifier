Follow-up data, including treatment response and overall survival time, were analyzed.\nThe rates of IDH1 mutation and MGMT expression in astrocytomas were 62.7% (30/48) and 47.9% (23/48), respectively. There was a negative correlation between IDH1 mutation and MGMT expression (r \u003d -0.641, P \u003c 0.01). The age of patients with IDH1 mutation was younger at disease onset. The IDH1 mutation rate in patients with WHO grade II astrocytoma was higher than that in patients with WHO grade III tumor (P \u003c 0.05). The age at onset was an independent factor affecting the expression of mutant IDH1. After radiotherapy, patients with IDH1 mutation+/MGMT- tumor carried a longer overall survival time than patients with IDH1 mutation-/MGMT+ tumor (P \u003c 0.05).\nThere is a correlation between IDH1 mutation and MGMT expression in WHO grade II to III astrocytoma. Age at onset is an independent factor affecting the expression of mutant IDH1. Tumors with IDH1+/MGMT- pattern show better response to radiotherapy than tumors with IDH1-/MGMT+ pattern. Detection of IDH1 mutation and MGMT protein expression can provide some guidance in choice of treatment modalities in patients with astrocytoma.","title":"[IDH1 mutation and MGMT expression in astrocytoma and the relationship with prognosis after radiotherapy].","pubmedId":"25567592"}
