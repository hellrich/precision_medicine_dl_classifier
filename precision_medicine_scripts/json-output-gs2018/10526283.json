TILs were isolated from tissue specimens by means of a mechanical dispersal technique, and the immunocyte subsets were quantified with dual-color flow cytometry. Bulky tumor was defined as tumor size \u003e4 cm in greatest dimension according to the 1995 staging of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.\nThe CD4/CD8 ratios of TILs were reversed in both cervical squamous cell carcinoma (n \u003d 20) and cervical adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 10). The proportion of CD4(+) T cells was significantly lower in tumors from patients with lymph node metastasis (n \u003d 8) than in those from patients without lymph node metastasis (n \u003d 22) (24.5 vs. 32.7, P \u003d 0.001), as was the reversed CD4/CD8 ratio (0.50 vs. 0.81, P \u003d 0.001). The proportion of CD4(+) T cells was much lower in bulky tumors (n \u003d 5) than in nonbulky tumors (n \u003d 25) (21.4 vs. 32.5, P \u003c 0.001), reflecting in a more strongly reversed CD4/CD8 ratio (0.41 vs. 0.81, P \u003d 0.001).\nDecreased proportions of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells with reversed CD4/CD8 ratios are highly correlated with rapid tumor growth and lymph node metastasis in cervical carcinoma. The regional immune escape is of prognostic importance with regard to cancer progression.","title":"Reversed CD4/CD8 ratios of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are correlated with the progression of human cervical carcinoma.","pubmedId":"10526283"}
