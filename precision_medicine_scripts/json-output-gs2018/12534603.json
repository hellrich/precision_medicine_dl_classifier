Age and period Poisson regression models were fitted to gender- and age-specific CMM mortality rates.\nIn males there were marked increases in all CMM mortality rates between 1975 and 1994, followed by their decrease during 1995-98. In contrast, rates rose in females between 1975 and 1998. There were annual increases of 13% in the risk of dying among males and 33% among females. Relative risks of CMM mortality increased with age in both genders: (i) 21.75 (95% confidence interval, CI 17.32-27.30) in males, and (ii) 28.27 (95% CI 24.99-31.97) in females in the \u003e or \u003d 70-year-old group, when compared with those \u003c 35 years.\nCMM mortality rates continue to rise in females while males have experienced a recent reversal of this trend in Spain. Emphasizing the danger of overexposure to ultraviolet radiation may be especially important in females.","title":"Gender differences in rising trends in cutaneous malignant melanoma in Spain, 1975-98.","pubmedId":"12534603"}
