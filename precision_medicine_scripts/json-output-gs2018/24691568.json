Reported drugs worked well in clinical practice, such as imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib. However, resistance arises due to ABL1 mutation in patients, especially the T315I gate-keeper mutation. Thus, wide spectrum drugs targeting ABL1 are urgently needed. In order to screen potential drugs targeting wild-type ABL1 and T315I mutant ABL1, 1408 FDA approved small molecule drugs were subjected to molecular docking. With subsequent molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and MM/GBSA binding free energy calculation and energy decomposition, we identified chlorhexidine and sorafenib as potential \"new use\" drugs targeting wild-type ABL1, while nicergoline and plerixafor targeted T315I ABL1. Meanwhile, we also found that residues located in the ATP-binding site and A-loop motif played key roles in drug discovery towards ABL1. These findings may not only serve as a paradigm for the repositioning of existing approved drugs, but also instill new vitality to ABL1-targeted anti-CML therapeutics.
