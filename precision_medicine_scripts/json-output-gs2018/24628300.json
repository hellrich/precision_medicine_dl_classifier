The gene also has been extensively studied in farm animals for its prominent role in coat color. The present work aimed at detecting KIT variants in a porcine model of cutaneous melanoma, the melanoblastoma-bearing Libechov Minipig (MeLiM). By sequencing exons and intron borders, 36 SNPs and one indel were identified. Of 10 coding SNPs, three were non-synonymous mutations, likely to affect the protein conformation. A promising variant, located in exon 19 (p.Val870Ala), was genotyped in a MeLiM Ã— Duroc cross, and an association analysis was conducted on several melanoma-related traits. This variant showed a significant association with melanoma development, tumor ulceration and cutaneous invasion. In conclusion, although the KIT gene would not be a major causal gene for melanoma development in pig, its genetic variation could be influencing this trait.","title":"KIT and melanoma predisposition in pigs: sequence variants and association analysis.","pubmedId":"24628300"}
