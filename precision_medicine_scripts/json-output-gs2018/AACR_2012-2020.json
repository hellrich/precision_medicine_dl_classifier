The elevated Twist expression in cancer cells has been shown to promote metastasis and induce chemoresistance. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of action by which Twist depletion induces chemosensitivity of lung cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agent. We found that knock-down of Twist expression by siRNAs sensitized H1299 cells to cisplatin by inhibiting mTOR activity. Inhibition of mTOR pathway using mTOR or S6K siRNAs led to potentiate cell death in cisplatin resistant H1299 cells. Our results suggest that suppression of Twist expression sensitized NSCLC cells to cisplatin treatment by down-regulating mTOR pathway.","title":"Suppression of Twist expression sensitizes human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to cisplatin","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2020"}
