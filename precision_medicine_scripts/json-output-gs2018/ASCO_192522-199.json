NSCLCs with ALK-rearrangement can be effectively treated with crizotinib. However, magnitude and duration of responses are found to be heterogeneous. This study explored the clinical efficacy of crizotinib in different ALK variants and abundance levels using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Methods: Among 89 ALK-rearrangement patients treated with crizotinib, 47 patients were identified with tumor specimens that could be evaluated by NGS. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy of crizotinib in different ALK variants and the abundance of ALK-fusion alleles. Results: The median PFS of the 89 ALK-rearrangement patients was 14.1 months (95%CI: 11.27-18.43 months). Among the 47 patients with NGS results, the most frequent variants were variant 3a/b (29.79%, 14/47), variant 1 (25.53%, 12/47) and variant 2 (14.89%, 7/47). Rare EML4-ALK variants were detected in 6 cases (12.77%). Other new fusion partners were detected in 8 cases (17.02%). Patients with EML4-ALK variant 2 appeared to have longer PFS than other EML4-ALK variants with a borderline p value. Patients were categorized into three groups based on the abundance of ALK-fusion alleles: low-abundance group ( \u003c 35%), middle-abundance group (35% and \u003c 55%), and high-abundance group (55%). Middle-abundance group had a better PFS than both low-abundance group and high-abundance group (P \u003d 0.01). After adjusting for other baseline characteristics, abundance levels of ALK-positive alleles and ALKvariant type were identified as important factors for predicting clinical efficacy of crizotinib. Conclusions: Our results indicate prolonged PFS in patients with EML4-ALK variant 2 versus other EML4-ALK patients. The abundance of ALK-fusion alleles also correlated with the extent of benefit from crizotinib treatment.","title":"Response to crizotinib in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLCs with different variants and abundance of ALK-fusion alleles.","pubmedId":"ASCO_192522-199"}
