Three different Bcr-Abl variants can be formed, depending on the amount of Bcr gene included: p185, p210, and p230. The three variants are associated with distinct types of human leukemias. Examination of the signaling pathways differentially regulated by the Bcr-Abl proteins will help us gain better insight into Bcr-Abl mediated leukemogenesis.","title":"Bcr-Abl variants: biological and clinical aspects.","pubmedId":"12191565"}
