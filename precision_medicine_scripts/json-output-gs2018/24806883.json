However, clinicopathological and molecular characteristics and the prognostic role of NRAS mutations remain unclear. In the present study, a total of 1,304 consecutive stage 0-IV CRC tumor samples were analyzed for KRAS (exon 2, 3 and 4), NRAS (exon 2 and 3) and BRAF (exon 15) mutations. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the prognostic impact of NRAS mutations. KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations were identified in 553 (42.4%), 35 (2.7%), and 59 (4.5%) of 1,304 CRC cases, respectively. Tumors with NRAS mutations were more frequently located in the distal colorectum compared with those with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Multivariate analysis indicated that KRAS and BRAF mutations were found to be associated with poor prognosis [hazard ratio (HR)\u003d1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-1.76 and HR\u003d2.09; 95% CI, 1.33-3.28, respectively], whereas NRAS mutations were associated with a trend toward favorable prognosis (HR\u003d0.53; 95% CI, 0.27-1.03). Characteristics and prognosis of CRC with NRAS mutations are different from those with KRAS or BRAF mutations.","title":"Clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic impact of colorectal cancers with NRAS mutations.","pubmedId":"24806883"}
