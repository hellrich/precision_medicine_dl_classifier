The method of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was further applied for 7 miRNAs in 15 cases of ALK-negatie anaplastic large cell lymphomas of lymph node and 15 cases of CD30-positive peripheral T cell lymphoma (not otherwise specified) of lymph node.\nThe significant difference of 13 miRNAs was found between ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma and CD30 positive peripheral T cell lymphoma (not otherwise specified) (P \u003c 0.05), of which the result of 5 miRNAs was consistent with miRNAs expression spectrum: miR-664b-5p, miR-1275, miR-4739, miR-4736 and miR-504-5p, the difference was statistically significant (P \u003c 0.05). Compared with reactive hyperplasia of lymph nodes, miR-664b-5p, miR-1275 and miR-4739 were significantly under-expressed (P \u003d 0.004, P \u003d 0.021, P \u003d 0.031) and miR-4736 and miR-504-5p were significantly over-expressed (P \u003d 0.009, P \u003d 0.007) in ALK negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\nMiR-664b-5p, miR-1275, miR-4739, miR-4736 and miR-504-5p may become an important indicator in the differentiation ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma from CD30-positive peripheral T cell lymphoma (not otherwise specified). MiR-4739, miR-4736 and miR-1275 may play important role in pathogenesis of negative-anaplastic large cell lymphoma by target genes: TNFRSF8 and TMOD1.","title":"[Expression of microRNA in ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma and CD30-positive peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified].","pubmedId":"26705180"}
