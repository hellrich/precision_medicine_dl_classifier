Infection with HPV is implicated in this cervical lesion. Differential diagnosis includes adenoid basal carcinoma, polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. Only one case of vaginal localisation was previously described. We report a case of adenoid cystic carcinoma in a 48-year-old woman with previous cervical HPV infection. Histological examination revealed nests of cells with peripheral palisading organisation and glandular lumina containing material produced by the tumor cells.","title":"[Vaginal adenoid cystic carcinoma: a case report].","pubmedId":"18675169"}
