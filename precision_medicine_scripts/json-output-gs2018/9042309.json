The primary goal of antileukemic therapy in these patients should be the identification of agents that are more selective and better targeted in their action. Tiazofurin is known to inhibit inosine 5\u0027-phosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate limiting enzyme of de novo guanine ribonucleotide synthesis. The activity of this enzyme is markedly increased in leukemic cells. To prevent de novo GTP synthesis, it is also necessary to block the guanine-salvaging activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This was achieved by increasing the plasma levels of hypoxanthine through the administration of allopurinol. Twenty-seven patients with end stage leukemia or myeloid blast crisis of CGL were treated with tiazofurin. Assays of IMPDH activity and GTP concentrations in leukemic cells, as well as hypoxanthine levels in the serum, provided a method to monitor the impact of tiazofurin/allopurinol therapy and to adjust drug doses. In these poor prognosis patients seven attained a complete response (CR), 3 had a hematologic improvement and an antileukemic effect was seen in 4. An excellent correlation was observed between biochemical and clinical activity of tiazofurin/allopurinol, with biochemical responses preceding clinical results. However, clinical responses were usually short-lived with IMPDH activity starting to increase soon after discontinuation of therapy, but patients responding again after reinstitution. Tiazofurin therapy was generally well tolerated in patients with less than 15 days of treatment and no other major medical complications. Although an antiproliferative effect was observed in some patients, bone marrows remained cellular in most cases with a marked shift from blasts to granulocytes. Severe neutropenia was absent in the majority of cases and patients could be discharged in good clinical condition immediately after completion of therapy. Tiazofurin/allopurinol therapy provided a rational, biochemically targeted and biochemically monitored approach to the treatment of poor prognosis leukemia and should serve as a paradigm in enzyme pattern-targeted chemotherapy.","title":"Biochemically targeted therapy of refractory leukemia and myeloid blast crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia with Tiazofurin, a selective blocker of inosine 5\u0027-phosphate dehydrogenase activity.","pubmedId":"9042309"}
