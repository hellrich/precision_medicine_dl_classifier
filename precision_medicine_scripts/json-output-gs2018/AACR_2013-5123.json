In vitro culture of CTCs has enabled us comparison of the chemosensitivity of tumor cells from primary H460 culture and of CTCs solated from blood grown in vitro. Cell line H460-RFP human lung cancer cells were grown to 70-80% confluence. Primary tumor were grown after subcutaneous injection of cultured cells. Fragments of tumor tissue (1 mm  1 mm) were implanted into the lungs of nude mice. At 14 days, the mice were sacrificied and blood was taken by cardiac puncture for CTC-analysis. The blood (0.5 ml), obtained by cardiac puncture, was put into an EDTA tube (BD) and the CTC cells were enriched by immunomagnetic separation targeted to eptihelial antigens. The enriched fraction or whole blood was put into culture. Cell growth was then monitored by fluorescence microscopy. The isolation and culture of the fluorescent CTC will enable their further characterization.","title":"In vitro culture for characterization of circulating GFP-expressing tumor cells in orthotopic lung cancer models .","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-5123"}
