Select alterations were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization.\nChromosomal gains were mostly confined to the areas of high-grade transformation while losses were seen only in the conventional areas. Chromosomal regions with significant gains included 8q24, 17q11.2-q12, 17q23, and 15q11-13. Regions that showed the significant losses included 9q34, 4p16, 1p36.1, and 11q22. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated increases in C-MYC (8q24.12-q24.13) and a low level increases in ERBB2 ( formerly HER2/neu ) (17q11.2-q12) in cases showing gains by array comparative genomic hybridization in these regions. However, no tumor showed HER2/ neu immunopositivity.\nHigh-grade transformation in adenoid cystic carcinoma is a complex process that is reflected by several chromosomal alterations. Our findings implicate C-MYC amplification in this progression, although the role of HER2/neu is still unclear. Other candidate oncogenes, particularly on chromosome 17q23, warrant investigation in this rare tumor.","title":"Progressive genetic alterations of adenoid cystic carcinoma with high-grade transformation.","pubmedId":"21204718"}
