The Xiphophorus CDKN2A/B gene, homologous to mammalian CDKN2A/B cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16 and p15), is a candidate tumor susceptibility gene in these models. Using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, we analyzed expression of CDKN2A/B in spontaneous and UV-induced primary melanomas from individual backcross hybrid fish. We found that CDKN2A/B mRNA is highly expressed in melanomas (18-fold), relative to other fish tissues. Expression is also elevated, to a lesser extent (9.5-fold), in melanized skin from tumor-bearing fish. However, quantitative levels of CDKN2A/B mRNA in tumors varied considerably and positively correlated with expression of the Xmrk oncogene, suggesting possible functional interaction between Xmrk and CDKN2A/B expression. As a homolog corresponding to members of the mammalian CDKN2 family which regulate cell cycle progression at the G1 checkpoint, the CDKN2A/B p13 protein is a putative regulator of the G1 checkpoint apparatus in Xiphophorus. Since CDKN2A is often observed to be inversely regulated compared to RB in some human tumors, and is capable of transcriptionally regulating RB in human ovarian tumors, we cloned the Xiphophorus maculatus RB cDNA and analyzed RB expression by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis in the fish melanomas. These experiments were designed to ascertain whether CDKN2A/B and RB expression were inversely correlated. Our results indicate that RB mRNA was consistently expressed at only a 2-fold higher level in both tumors and melanized skin than in muscle. Qualitatively similar results were obtained for protein expression. These results collectively suggest that (i) Xmrk and CDKN2A/B may be co-regulated at the transcriptional level, and (ii) there is little, if any, alteration of RB expression in Xiphophorus melanomas.","title":"Regulation of CDKN2A/B and Retinoblastoma genes in Xiphophorus melanoma.","pubmedId":"17011832"}
