Testosterone significantly increased anogenital distance and delayed vaginal opening of progeny. When females that had been exposed to testosterone in utero were tested for breeding capacity, a significantly smaller number mated than in the control group. Female rats that had been exposed to cortisone in utero exhibited premature vaginal opening but did not differ from controls in anogenital distance, and, unlike the testosterone-exposed rats, mated. Cortisone-exposed rats carried litters to term and the litters did not differ from those of controls in numbers of pups or numbers of living pups at birth. The pups born to cortisone-exposed rats had greater birth weights and a higher survival rate to 20 days of age than pups of controls. Results indicate that testosterone administration to rats during pregnancy is far more detrimental to the development and subsequent function of the reproductive system of female progeny than cortisone and suggest that similar changes which occur in response to maternal stress or to administration of ACTH during pregnancy are more likely to result from increases in testosterone than from increases in glucocorticoid secretion.","title":"Effects of prenatal administration of testosterone and cortisone on the reproductive system of the female rat.","pubmedId":"1740970"}
