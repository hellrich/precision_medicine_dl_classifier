SNPs in the EGFR signal pathway, drug metabolism/ transport pathways and miRNA might contribute to the interpersonal difference in ADRs but biomarkers for therapeutic responses and ADRs to TKIs in Chinese population are yet to be fully investigated. We recruited 226 Chinese advanced NSCLC patients who received TKIs erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib hydrochloride and systematically studied the genetic factors associated with therapeutic responses and ADRs. Rs884225 (T \u003e C) in EGFR 3\u0027 UTR was significantly associated with lower risk of ADRs to erlotinib (p value \u003d 0.0010, adjusted p value \u003d 0.042). A multivariant interaction four-SNP model (rs884225 in EGFR 3\u0027UTR, rs7787082 in ABCB1 intron, rs38845 in MET intron and rs3803300 in AKT1 5\u0027UTR) was associated with ADRs in general and the more specific drug induced skin injury. The SNPs associated with both therapeutic responses and ADRs indicates they might share a common genetic basis. Our study provided potential biomarkers and clues for further research of biomarkers for therapeutic responses and ADRs in Chinese NSCLC patients.","title":"Genetic Association of Curative and Adverse Reactions to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Chinese advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients.","pubmedId":"26988277"}
