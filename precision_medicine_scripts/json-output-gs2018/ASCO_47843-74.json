In our study, we evaluated hotspots in the EGFR pathway with a focus on PTEN. Methods: Patients (pt) who had received cetuximab or panitumumab and had available tissue were identified from pharmacy database. In all, 76 pt (119 tissue samples) were tested for mutations by pyrosequencing at 15 hotspots - KRAS codons 12/13/61, BRAF(V600E), PIK3CA Exon 9 (E542K, E545K) and Exon20 (R1023Q, H1047R), PIK3R1 (splice site mutation in intron 12-13), AKT (E17K), PTEN truncating mutations (R130X, Q214X, R233X, Q245X, R335X) and methylation analysis of 4 CpG islands in promoter region of PTEN gene by methylation specific polymerase chain reaction. One hundred and six tissues were tested for PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC); 44 pt had at least 4 weeks of therapy and were considered for clinical correlates. Results: Among 76 pt, mutation prevalence was KRAS12/13/61 (29, 13, 5 %), BRAF (8%), PIK3CA - E542K, E545K, R1023Q, H1047R (4, 20, 4, 2.5%), PIK3R1 (17%), PTEN - R130X, R233X, Q245X and R335X (2.5, 2.5, 1, 28%), and none in AKT, and PTEN Q214X. PTEN IHC was positive in 21/51 metastatic and 22/54 primary tissues, with a concordance rate of 47% between matched primary and metastatic pairs. We observed 4 partial responses (PR) among 44 pts (9%). All PR were PTEN positive in the primary tumor and lack of PTEN by IHC in primary predicted for lack of response (Fisher Exact test [FET] p \u003d 0.04). KRAS and BRAF mutations predicted for clinical benefit (PFS 8.5 vs. 23.3 wk, HR 2.12, p \u003d 0.0085 and OS 23.9 vs. 46wk, HR 2.178, p \u003d 0.0055); while PIK3CA mutations did not. Truncating PTEN mutation R335X was associated with IHC negativity (FET 0.002), however promoter methylation was not. Conclusions: Absence of PTEN in the primary tumor (by IHC), is predictive of lack of benefit from anti EGFR therapy in pt with mCRC. PTEN truncating mutation correlates with IHC and is a potential biomarker requiring further exploration in larger studies. PIK3CA mutations are not predictive of benefit from anti-EGFR therapy.","title":"Beyond KRAS: The quest for novel genetic markers predictive for response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_47843-74"}
