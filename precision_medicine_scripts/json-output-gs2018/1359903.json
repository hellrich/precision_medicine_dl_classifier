The responsiveness of some patients with metastatic melanoma to treatment with the prototypic T-cell growth factor (TCGF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), indicates that T cells play a role in antitumor immunity. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), another TCGF that has been administered clinically to humans, was not associated with tumor response in our trials conducted at the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute. Combination trials of IL-2 with IL-4 have shown no increase in responsiveness of melanoma or other tumors when compared to IL-2 alone. However, enhanced expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in vitro has been observed with combinations of low-dose IL-2 and IL-4. We have begun a study evaluating the trafficking of such expanded lymphocytes following their adoptive transfer in association with systemic administration of IL-2 and IL-4. We have established several TIL cultures from fresh tumor samples, maintained them in long-term culture, and marked them with the neomycin phosphotransferase gene using the LNL6 retroviral vector. Such TILs appear to demonstrate no notable alterations in phenotype or cytolytic activity when compared to their nontransduced counterparts. In addition to IL-2 and IL-4, there are a variety of other novel TCGFs that are now available for evaluation in preclinical and clinical trials. IL-7 induces proliferation and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Use of T-cell growth factors (interleukins 2, 4, 7, 10, and 12) in the evaluation of T-cell reactivity to melanoma.","pubmedId":"1359903"}
