There was no significant difference in skull base invasion rates between 2 groups (53.3% vs 66.7%,χ(2) \u003d 1.181, P \u003d 0.277) . ACC had higher rates of MRI-detected cranial nerve canal invasion (32.4% vs 55.6%,χ(2) \u003d 3.881, P \u003d 0.049) and cavernous sinus invasion (13.7% vs 33.3%,χ(2) \u003d 7.710, P \u003d 0.028) than NPC. Lymph node metastasis occurred in 64.8% of ACC, and 11.1% of NPC (χ(2) \u003d 19.699, P \u003c 0.001) .\nACC has a higher rate of cranial nerve invasion and NPC has a higher rate of lymphatic metastasis.","title":"[Imaging and clinical features of nasopharyngeal adenoid cystic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"24444639"}
