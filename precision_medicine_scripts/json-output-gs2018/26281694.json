Clinical studies have demonstrated that the following 6 targeted agents showed antitumor activity in patients with mCRC: bevacizumab, aflibercept, ramucirumab, cetuximab, panitumumab and regorafenib. KRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) mutations were negative predictive biomarkers for efficacy of anti-EGFR antibody therapy. Expanded RAS mutations (including KRAS exon 2, exon 3 and exon 4 mutations as well as NRAS mutations) can further predict the therapeutic effects of this therapy. It seems to be necessary to identify new predictive biomarkers and develop new targeted agents for personalized treatment for mCRC.","title":"[Targeted therapies for metastatic colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"26281694"}
