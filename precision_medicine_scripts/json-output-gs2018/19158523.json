Therefore, excision is often limited, leading to positive margins, and increased local recurrence. Immediate reconstruction carries concern for rearrangement or concealment of cancerous tissues. Therefore, reconstruction is often delayed until confirming negative margins on permanent pathology. Our purpose is to identify variables associated with a positive margin and establish criteria for reconstruction timing. We reviewed 117 consecutive patients who underwent wide local excision of head and neck melanoma. Reconstruction was immediate for 107 and delayed for 10. Six percent of patients had a positive margin after wide local excision with no difference in incidence between immediate and delayed reconstruction (P \u003d 0.11). Tumor characteristics associated with a positive margin were locally recurrent, ulcerated, and T4 tumors (P \u003c 0.05); and delayed reconstruction should be considered in these circumstances. Immediate reconstruction is safe for the majority of head and neck melanoma and should be based on knowledge of tumor characteristics.","title":"Head and neck malignant melanoma: margin status and immediate reconstruction.","pubmedId":"19158523"}
