We hypothesized that quantifying key immune suppression mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment would provide superior predictors of response to anti-PD-1 compared with single marker assessment. Methods: Pre-treatment tumor biopsies from 124 mm pts treated with anti-PD-1 at 7 academic centers were fluorescently stained with multiple immune markers in discovery (n \u003d 24) and validation (n \u003d 100) cohorts. Selected biomarker signatures, PD-1/PD-L1 interaction score (proportion of PD-1+ cells co-localized with PD-L1) and IDO1/HLA-DR co-expression were evaluated for anti-PD-1 treatment response and survival. Slides were imaged using Vectra; biomarker positive cells and their co-localization were objectively quantified in pathologist-selected regions using novel Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA) algorithms. Results: In the discovery cohort, high levels of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction score and/or IDO1/HLA-DR coexpression was strongly positively associated with response to anti-PD-1 (p \u003d 0.0005). In contrast, other individual biomarkers (PD-1, PD-L1, CD8) were not associated with response or survival (p \u003e 0.10). This finding was replicated in the validation cohort: pts with high PD-1/PD-L1 and/or IDO1/HLA-DR were more likely to respond to treatment (p \u003d 0.009). These pts also experienced a three-fold increase in progression free survival (hazards ratio (HR) \u003d 0.33; p \u003d 0.003) and overall survival (HR \u003d 0.34; p \u003d 0.004). Multivariate analyses revealed that these findings were independent of BRAF mutation, stage, LDH and prior therapy. In the combined cohort (n \u003d 124), 80% of responding pts had higher levels of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction scores and/or IDO1/HLA-DR. In contrast, PD-L1 expression alone (1% or 50%) was not predictive of PFS or OS (p \u003e 0.1). Conclusions: This novel multiplexed method profiling key tumor-immune suppression pathways identified mm pts likely to respond to anti-PD-1 therapy. This method could help stratify patients for PD-1 monotherapy and be useful in guiding future clinical trials.","title":"Quantitative spatial profiling of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and HLA-DR/IDO1 to predict outcomes to anti-PD-1 in metastatic melanoma (MM).","pubmedId":"ASCO_191357-199"}
