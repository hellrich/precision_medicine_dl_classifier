The relationship between the expression of both markers and survival status was determined.\nOverexpression of SOX2 and FGFR1 were revealed in SCLC tumors than in normal tissues (P\u003c0.05). SOX2 expression was associated with clinical stage (P\u003d0.014) and lymph node status (P\u003d0.041). Besides, FGFR1 expression was significantly higher in ever smokers (P\u003d0.030) and late stage SCLC (P\u003d0.005). SOX2, FGFR1 and TNM stage were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and Recurrence-free survival (RFS) by multivariate analysis. In stage I patients, only overexpression of SOX2, but not of FGFR1, predicted poor OS (0.027) and RFS (P\u003d0.013). According to the expression of SOX2 and FGFR1, patients were categorized into three groups. Patients with elevated expression of both markers belonged to the group with the shortest RFS (P\u003c0.0001) and OS (P\u003c0.0001).\nIncreased expression of SOX2 and FGFR1 may be available as poor prognostic indicators in SCLC patients.","title":"Elevated expression of SOX2 and FGFR1 in correlation with poor prognosis in patients with small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24294370"}
