The parents had a history of separation, violence, alcohol and/or drug abuse, and inability to take care of the children. The girls had a long history of serious behavioural problems. Four girls had set one fire, six had set several fires within a period of a few days, three had a long-standing history of setting fires. The girls showed a lack of remorse or concern for their behaviours.","title":"Adolescent female firesetters.","pubmedId":"1933742"}
