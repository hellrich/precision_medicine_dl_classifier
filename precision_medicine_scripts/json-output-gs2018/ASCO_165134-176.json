CMP-001 is comprised of a CpG-A oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) formulated within a virus-like particle. The CpG ODN is a TLR9 agonist that activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells leading to the production of high local concentrations of Type I interferons and subsequent activation of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells that express PD-1. In syngeneic mouse models intratumoral delivery of CMP-001 in combination with systemic anti-PD-1 antibody improved tumor growth control and promoted regression in injected and un-injected tumors when compared to either agent alone. These data provide the rationale to study this combination in cancer patients. CMP-001 has been previously studied in over 700 human subjects for non-oncology indications. Adverse events noted in prior studies were primarily grade 1/2 fever, chills, flu-like symptoms and local injection-site reactions following subcutaneous administration. Methods: A Phase Ib study of CMP-001 given in combination with pembro has recently opened for enrollment at study sites in the U.S. Eligible subjects must have received pembro for advanced melanoma and present with either progressive disease, or stable disease after at least 12 weeks of pembro therapy. Subjects are permitted to have received prior treatment with anti-CLTA-4 antibody and must have received prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor if known to have BRAF V600E+ tumors. CMP-001 is administered by intratumoral injection weekly for seven weeks, followed by q6 week dosing. Planned dose levels for CMP-001 are 1, 3, 10 and 24 mg. Pembro will continue at 2 mg/kg q3 weeks. A 3+3 design will be used during dose escalation. One or more expansion cohorts of approximately 12 subjects per cohort are planned with optional tumor biopsies pre- and on-treatment.
