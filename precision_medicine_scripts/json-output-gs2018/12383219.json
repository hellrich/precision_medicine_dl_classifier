The gold standard for diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma is conventional histology, the essential element being the characteristic nuclear features, regardless of whether papillary structures are present or not. However, other criteria are being used increasingly in the diagnosis of neoplasms, including immunohistochemical staining and molecular profile. The RET/PTC gene rearrangement is highly specific for papillary thyroid carcinoma and is associated with the characteristic nuclear features seen in papillary thyroid carcinoma. There is an overlap in the morphological features, immunohistochemical staining pattern, and most importantly, molecular profile between papillary thyroid carcinoma and Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis. Although considered a \u0027benign\u0027 condition, Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis almost always harbours a genetic rearrangement that is strongly associated with and is highly specific for papillary thyroid carcinoma. Submicroscopic foci of papillary thyroid carcinoma must be present in Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis, although the clinical behaviour is still benign. Further studies are required to predict which foci will progress to papillary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis shares features with early papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"12383219"}
