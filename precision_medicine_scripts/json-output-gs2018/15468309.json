These results were irrespective of the type of tumour, survival chemotherapy or other clinical variables.\np185(HER-2) serum levels do not appear to be of diagnostic or predictive value for differentiation of high-grade osteosarcoma and Ewing Sarcoma.","title":"Soluble p185(HER-2) in patients with malignant bone tumours.","pubmedId":"15468309"}
