A 35-year-old woman presented with a painful mass located in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast. A biopsy revealed histologically that the tumor had a multinodular architecture with malignant spindle cells forming cuffs around multiple open benign ducts. No leaf-like architecture was present. In addition, liposarcomatous differentiation was seen in focal areas. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive for CD34, vimentin and CDK4, and negative for ER, PR, Her2/neu, CD10, CD117, p63, bcl-2, cytokeratin, and MDM2. A diagnosis of periductal stromal sarcoma with liposarcomatous differentiation was established. Following excision with mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient was disease-free for 10 years. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of periductal stromal sarcoma showing liposarcomatous differentiation.
