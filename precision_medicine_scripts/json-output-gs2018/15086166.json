Breast metastasis from non-mammary malignant neoplasm is rare, accounting for approximately 2% of breast tumors. Breast metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma has never been reported.\nThe medical records of three patients with breast metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma treated at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Taipei were retrospectively reviewed.\nThe study comprised one male patient and two female patients with ages ranging from 41 to 73 years (median: 53 years). All three patients had cirrhotic liver. The interval between diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast metastasis ranged from 0 to 40 months (median 20 months). All three patients displayed extrahepatic metastasis when breast metastases were diagnosed. All three patients expired within one month after diagnosis of the breast metastasis.\nBreast metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma is rare and hematogenous route is the mode of spread. It represents an extremely advanced stage of hepatocellular carcinoma and the prognosis is dismal.","title":"Breast metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"15086166"}
