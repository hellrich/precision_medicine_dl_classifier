We recently demonstrated the importance of PDK1 in melanoma development and progression (Oncogene 2013). Genetic ablation of PDK1 in melanocytes effectively delayed melanoma development and inhibited metastasis in a Braf/Cdkn2a model with WT or mutant Pten. In an effort to identify small molecule inhibitors that could affect the PDK1 signaling we characterized SBI-0089410, a small molecule identified in a screen for nuclear exclusion of the transcription factor ATF2, which attenuates its oncogenic activity while enabling its function at the mitochondrial membrane to promote apoptosis. SBI-0089410 reduced melanoma cell viability, inhibited colony formation and spheroid growth, decreased mitochondrial membrane permeability, decreased ATF2 phosphorylation by PKC and altered ATF2 transcriptional activity. Notably, the effect of SBI-0089401 was attenuated by the overexpression of constitutively active PKC or ATF2T52E, which carries a phosphomimetic mutation at the PKC phosphorylation site. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA), validated by western blot analysis, revealed that SBI-408910 attenuates PI3K/AKT/PDK1 signaling pathways. In vivo, SBI-089410 attenuated the growth of Braf/Cdkn2a/Pten tumors in a syngeneic B6 mouse model, as well as prevented their resistance to BRAFi. Our studies substantiate the importance of targeting PI3K/PDK1 signaling in melanoma as a means for effective therapy and prevention of chemoresistance.","title":"Inhibition of melanoma growth by small molecules that attenuate PI3K/PDK1 signaling and promote ATF2 mitochondrial localization","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4520"}
