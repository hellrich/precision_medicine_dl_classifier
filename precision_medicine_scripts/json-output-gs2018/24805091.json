Mutation of the RET proto-oncogene is known to be responsible for development of FMTC and for multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B. Hirschsprung\u0027s disease is the most common form of structural intestinal obstructive disease in human newborns. Hirschsprung\u0027s disease is defined by the absence of neural crest-derived enteric ganglia along a variable length of the bowel that invariably involves the rectoanal junction. Co-segregation of FMTC and Hirschsprung\u0027s disease is uncommon; nevertheless, in 3 generations of 1 family, we observed 5 patients with FMTC, 2 patients with Hirschsprung\u0027s disease, and 1 patient with characteristics of both FMTC and Hirschsprung\u0027s disease. Moreover, a Cys620Ser mutation in RET was identified in 4 of the 8 patients. This mutation had both activating and inactivating effects on the RET (REarranged during Transfection) protein. There were individual differences in the penetrance of Hirschsprung\u0027s disease due to the RET mutation, but the penetrance of MTC was uniform and high. Genetic testing is important for making decisions about treatment and follow-up in families of this kind.
