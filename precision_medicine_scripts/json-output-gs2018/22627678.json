The discontinuation rate on the 50-mg twice-daily dose schedule was lower than 100 mg twice daily, and no grade 3/4 nausea or vomiting was seen. The complete remission rate for the midostaurin 50-mg twice-daily dose schedule was 80% (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (FLT3)-wild-type: 20 of 27 (74%), FLT3-mutant: 12 of 13 (92%)). Overall survival (OS) probabilities of patients with FLT3-mutant AML at 1 and 2 years (0.85 and 0.62, respectively) were similar to the FLT3-wild-type population (0.78 and 0.52, respectively). Midostaurin in combination with standard chemotherapy demonstrated high complete response and OS rates in newly diagnosed younger adults with AML, and was generally well tolerated at 50 mg twice daily for 14 days. A phase III prospective trial is ongoing (CALGB 10603, NCT00651261).","title":"Phase IB study of the FLT3 kinase inhibitor midostaurin with chemotherapy in younger newly diagnosed adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"22627678"}
