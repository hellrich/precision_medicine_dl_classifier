Papillary thyroid cancer is most common and is associated with activating BRAFV600E mutations. Jolly et al. recently found that murine papillary thyroid cancers with consitutively active BRAF and a PTEN deletion recruit cancer-associated fibroblasts that enrich the tumor with collagen, a component of the extracellular matrix. Our study addresses how collagen impacts tumorigenicity of papillary thyroid cancer cells. Cell lines derived from mouse models of papillary thyroid cancer with BRAFV600E mutations and PTEN deletions were grown in the presence or absence of collagen and assessed for cellular proliferation, altered cellular morphology, secretion of microvesicles, and altered cellular signaling. Our results show that papillary thyroid cancer cells increase microvesicle secretion and have increased growth rates. Collectively, our study suggests that collagen enhances tumorigenic characteristics of papillary thyroid cancer cells.","title":"Collagen enhances tumorigenicity of papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-5918"}
