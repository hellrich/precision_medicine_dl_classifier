Patients usually present with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. These patients have a very poor prognosis with a median survival of about 10â€…months. We present a patient, with a history of CLL in complete remission, who presented with splenic rupture requiring splenectomy.
