The tumor arose in soft tissue of the neck, and diagnostic tissue was obtained by core needle biopsy. Histologically, the neoplasm was cellular without pattern. Immunohistochemical workup with a large panel of antibodies at another institution showed immunoreactivity for NB84 and neuron specific enolase (dim). Antibodies specific for CD3, CD20, and CD45/LCA were negative; CD30 or ALK were not assessed. Electron microscopy showed cytoplasmic structures thought to be neurosecretory granules. The neoplasm was interpreted initially as a neuroblastoma. At the time of our review, we considered the possibility of ALCL. Immunohistochemical analysis for CD30 showed bright, uniform expression and ALK was positive in a nuclear and cytoplasmic pattern, confirming the diagnosis of ALK+ ALCL. The purpose of this review is to discuss ALK+ ALCL and many of the other entities included under the rubric of small round blue cell tumor, with a focus on tumors that occur in children.","title":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma: another entity in the differential diagnosis of small round blue cell tumors.","pubmedId":"19917480"}
