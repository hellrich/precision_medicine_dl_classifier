Samples were sent for hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis. Six cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy were given and the patient was followed up.\nThe operation was uneventful. Postoperative pathologic and immunohistochemical examination yielded a diagnosis of primary CD30-positive and ALK-positive ALCL of the esophagus. The patient was in complete remission at the 14-month follow-up.\nALCL of the esophagus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of esophageal submucosal lesions. Biopsy through either esophagoscopy or surgical exploration, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy can be chosen for long-term survival.","title":"Primary esophageal CD30-positive ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma: a case report and literature review.","pubmedId":"20524084"}
