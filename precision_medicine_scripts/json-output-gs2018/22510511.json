Nearly 20%-50% will accompany by metastatic disease and the most common extrapulmonary sites of distant metastases are the brain, bone, liver and adrenal gland. The oligometastatic state is a biologically mild tumor stage and a intermediate state in which spread may be limited to specific organs and metastases might be present in limited numbers. Oligometastases are thought to arise from micrometastases, which have been dormant for a period of time. Local control may be an crucial component of a curative therapeutic strategy in the following four clinical schemes: to prohibit metastases; to cure occult metastatic disease; to remedy oligometastases; and to deracinate any residual lesion after systemic therapy. This review aims to outline the concept of the oligometastatic NSCLC and its strategies of treatment.","title":"[The conceptual oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer and therapeutic strategies].","pubmedId":"22510511"}
