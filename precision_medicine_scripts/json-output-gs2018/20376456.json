She was already undergoing chemotherapy for histopathologically proven liver metastases caused by an assumed melanoma. The location of the primary tumor was unknown. Whole-body FDG-PET/CT staging identified a lesion with characteristically malignant uptake in the region of the left eye as the primary tumor. After enucleation, a primary uveal melanoma was verified that expressed the serological marker melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA). FDG-PET/CT was able to successfully align hepatic metastases due to CUP with local ophthalmologic diagnostic findings and led to a correct diagnosis.","title":"[Hepatic metastases in CUP (cancer of unknown primary) and painful amaurosis].","pubmedId":"20376456"}
