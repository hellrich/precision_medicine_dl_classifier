Kinetic analysis of the association of nerve growth factor (NGF) with its receptor revealed a rapid loss of binding sites at high ligand concentrations. Using cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with an anti-p75NGFR antibody, this was found to be due to a decrease of the high molecular weight form of the receptor. Mechanisms for such a ligand-induced receptor loss are discussed.","title":"Nerve growth factor-induced loss of cell-associated nerve growth factor receptor in human melanoma A875 cells.","pubmedId":"1321963"}
