However, sometimes, discrimination between dysplastic nevi and early melanomas is difficult, even for experienced pathologists. Besides histology, the silencing of tumor suppressor genes aids in the diagnosis of melanoma. We have shown previously that tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 (TSLC1) is a tumor suppressor gene, and its silencing through aberrant promoter methylation is associated with the generation of cutaneous melanoma. To examine TSLC1 expression in melanocytic skin lesions to determine whether it can serve as a diagnostic marker in histologically questionable lesions. Cytoplasmic localization of the expression of the TSLC1 gene was detected by immunohistochemistry; the levels of TSLC1 mRNA and protein were detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR and western blot, respectively. Using immunohistochemistry, the average TSLC1 expression levels in cutaneous melanomas decreased approximately 3.6-fold (n\u003d20) as compared with dysplastic nevi (n\u003d30) and 3.7-fold as compared with normal skin (n\u003d25). The average expression levels of TSLC1 mRNA and protein in dysplastic nevi lesions and normal skin were significantly higher than the levels in cutaneous melanomas. No significant changes in TSLC1 mRNA and protein expressions were found between normal skin and dysplastic nevi. Our results show that a loss of TSLC1 frequently occurs in cutaneous melanoma, and indicate that it could serve as a diagnostic marker for cutaneous melanoma in histologically questionable lesions.","title":"TSLC1 expression discriminates cutaneous melanomas from dysplastic nevi.","pubmedId":"23047161"}
