Bone marrow morphological specimens were stained with Pappenheim stain. The karyotype was investigated using the standard GTG-banding method. Blast cells were immunotyped in a five-color analysis on a Cytomics FC 500 laser flow cytofluorometer.\nFLT3-ITD mutation was identified in 21 patients who had a varying morphological nature of blasts, different karyotype variants, and frequently additional NPM1 gene mutation. The distinctive property of 10 patients with normal karyotype and FLT3-ITD mutation (without NPM1 gene mutation) was the larger number of cases with high expression of HLA-DR and CD7 than in the control group that included 18 patients with normal karyotype AML without FLT3-ITD nutation: 50% versus 6.2% (p \u003d 0.007) and 100% versus 55.6% (p \u003d 0.014), respectively.\nNormal karyotype AML with FLT3-ITD mutation is a group that is homogeneous in the biological phenotype of leukemia cells.","title":"[The specific features of the immunophenotype of blast cells in patients with de novo normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia and FLT3-ITD mutation].","pubmedId":"24779074"}
