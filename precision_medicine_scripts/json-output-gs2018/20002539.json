Functional abnormalities of this pathway, which manifest themselves in vitro as a poor anticoagulant response of plasma to added APC (APC resistance), are prevalent in the general population and are associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. APC resistance was originally discovered in thrombophilic families and later shown to be associated with the common FV Arg506Gln (FV(Leiden)) mutation, which abolishes one of the APC-cleavage sites in FV. Although FV(Leiden) is the major cause of hereditary APC resistance, it is becoming increasingly clear that several other genetic and acquired conditions contribute to APC resistance and thereby increase the risk of venous thrombosis. This paper reviews the multifactorial etiology of APC resistance and discusses its clinical implications.","title":"APC resistance: biological basis and acquired influences.","pubmedId":"20002539"}
