The analytical process makes use of evolution patterns of molecular fragments generated during the well controlled degradation of the cells. The process has been shown to be effective both in grouping together malignant cells that originate from the same diseases and in distinguishing between malignant cells originating from different diseases. The reproducibility of the method has been demonstrated.","title":"Monitoring normal and malignant human white blood cells by the use of linear programmed thermal degradation mass spectrometry.","pubmedId":"272206"}
