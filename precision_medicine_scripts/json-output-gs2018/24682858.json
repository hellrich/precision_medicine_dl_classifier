Thirty percent of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harbor activating mutations in FLT3, either internal tandem duplication mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (FLT3-ITD) or point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3 TKD). Small molecule FLT3 inhibitors have emerged as an attractive therapeutic option in patients with FLT3 mutations; however, the clinical activity of early inhibitors was limited by a lack of selectivity, potency and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties. Newer agents such as quizartinib have improved potency and selectivity associated with much higher bone marrow response rates; however, response duration is limited by the development of secondary resistance. We will review here a number of FLT3 inhibitors that have been evaluated in clinical trials and discuss challenges facing the use of these agents in AML.
