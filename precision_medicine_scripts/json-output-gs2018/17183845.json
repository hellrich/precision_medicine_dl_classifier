This study evaluated the role of c-erbB-2 expression in medulloblastoma as a prognostic marker. Fifty cases of medulloblastomas were investigated for the expression of c-erbB-2 protein using immunohistochemistry. The expression of c-erbB-2 was correlated with age, histology and disease-free survival (DFS). Thirty-five (70%) tumors were c-erbB-2 positive. Immunoreactivity for c-erbB-2 receptor was observed as mixed cytoplasmic and membrane positivity of tumour cells. The mean DFS in c-erbB-2 positive cases was 19.81 months compared to 48.33 months in c-erbB-2 negative cases. c-erbB-2 positivity was found to be an independent predictor of poor outcome in medulloblastoma (p value \u003c 0.05). No correlation of c-erbB-2 expression was observed with the age of patient and the histological type of tumour. Additionally, c-erbB-4 expression was also evaluated in these tumours. Thirty-three cases showed co-expression of c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-4 proteins. However, c-erbB-4 expression alone was not associated with poor outcome, whereas its co-expression with c-erbB-2 was associated with shorter DFS (p \u003c 0.05).","title":"Does c-erbB-2 expression have a role in medulloblastoma prognosis?","pubmedId":"17183845"}
