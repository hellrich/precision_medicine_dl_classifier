It has a slow growing pattern and remarkable capacity for local recurrence. We report a patient with a rare case of adenoid cystic carcinoma in the nasopharynx, who died only 11 months after initial treatment. The tumor was very radiosensitive, but had an aggressive clinical course. Autopsy revealed the histological type to be adenoid cystic carcinoma showing the solid pattern. Many bone and dura metastases were found, but no residual tumors were observed in the sites treated by radiation therapy.","title":"A case report of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the nasopharynx with aggressive systemic bone metastases.","pubmedId":"8850372"}
