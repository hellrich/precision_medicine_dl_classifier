A subgroup of 108 women was studied. Cervical mediastinoscopy was performed in all cases, with the addition of anterior mediastinotomy in cases with left upper lobe involvement. All patients underwent a preoperative computed tomography chest scan.\nCervical mediastinoscopy was performed on all 108 patients, 26 of whom also underwent anterior mediastinotomy. Positive findings were recorded in 44 (40.7%) of the 108 cases: 39 of the 108 mediastinoscopies (36.1%), 9 of the 26 mediastinotomies (34.6%), and in 5 cases (19.2%) both mediastinoscopy and mediastinotomy. Nodal involvement was found in 13% of cases in clinical stage IA and 30.8% of cases in clinical stage IB. The percentage of positive findings was significantly higher for cases with adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma (P\u003c.05). We performed 67 thoracotomies: 46 patients underwent lobectomy (42.6% of the 108), 7 bilobectomy (6.5%), 9 pneumonectomy (8.3%), and 5 exploratory thoracotomy (4.6%). The agreement between clinical staging after mediastinoscopy and pathological staging after thoracotomy was 47% (stage IA) and 57% (stage IB).\nRoutine mediastinoscopy is indicated for all women with nonsmall cell lung cancer, regardless of clinical stage.","title":"[Importance of routine mediastinal staging in women with non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"15766464"}
