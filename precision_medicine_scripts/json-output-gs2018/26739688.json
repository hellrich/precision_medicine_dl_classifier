This phase 2b study (LIRA-B) evaluated lambda in patients with chronic HBV infection.\nAdult HBeAg+ interferon-naive patients were randomized (1:1) to weekly lambda (180 Î¼g) or peginterferon alfa-2a (alfa) for 48 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was HBeAg seroconversion at week 24 post-treatment; lambda non-inferiority was demonstrated if the 80% confidence interval (80% CI) lower bound was \u003e-15%.\nBaseline characteristics were balanced across groups (lambda N\u003d80; alfa N\u003d83). Early on-treatment declines in HBV-DNA and qHBsAg through week 24 were greater with lambda. HBeAg seroconversion rates were comparable for lambda and alfa at week 48 (17.5% vs. 16.9%, respectively); however lambda non-inferiority was not met at week 24 post-treatment (13.8% vs. 30.1%, respectively; lambda vs. alfa 80% CI lower bound -24%). Results for other key secondary endpoints (virologic, serologic, biochemical) and post hoc combined endpoints (HBV-DNA \u003c2000 IU/ml plus HBeAg seroconversion or ALT normalization) mostly favored alfa. Overall adverse events (AE), serious AE, and AE-discontinuation rates were comparable between arms but AE-spectra differed (more cytopenias, flu-like, and musculoskeletal symptoms observed with alfa, more ALT flares and bilirubin elevations seen with lambda). Most on-treatment flares occurred early (weeks 4-12), associated with HBV-DNA decline; all post-treatment flares were preceded by HBV-DNA rise.\nOn-treatment, lambda showed greater early effects on HBV-DNA and qHBsAg, and comparable serologic/virologic responses at end-of-treatment. However, post-treatment, alfa-associated HBeAg seroconversion rates were higher, and key secondary results mostly favored alfa.
