Numerous genetic aberrations at the ALK locus are observed in cancer including point mutations, amplifications, translocations and inversions. Inversions are exemplified by inv(2)(p21;p23), which leads to the constitutively active oncogenic fusion protein EML4-ALK present in 5% of NSCLC. Crizotinib, a dual cMet/ALK kinase inhibitor, was recently approved by the FDA for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is ALK-positive, thereby validating ALK as therapeutic target. Here we describe the pharmacological characterization of a novel series of potent, selective and orally bioavailable ALK kinase inhibitors. Members of this series inhibit wild type ALK, NPM-ALK fusion and crizotinib resistant ALK[L1196M] kinase activity at sub-nanomolar concentrations, displaying up to 200 fold increased inhibitory activity over crizotinib. Kinase profiling indicate that members of this series display increased selectivity scores relative crizotinib. In Karpas-299 cells, selected compounds inhibited both pY1604 ALK activation (IC50 \u003d 2 nM) and cell proliferation (IC50 \u003d 1 nM). Members of this series were also evaluated in the EML4-ALK expressing NSCLC cell line H3122, and displayed equipotent inhibition of pY1604 ALK activation and inhibition of cell proliferation (both IC50 \u003d 1 nM). Members of this class did not inhibit growth of an ALK negative lymphoma cell line (HT). The in vivo activity of this series was examined in the Karpas-299 ALCL xenograft model. Compound was dosed daily (PO) at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg. Tumor growth inhibition was observed at all dose levels, and the highest dose level resulted in significant tumor regression (96%, p\u003c0.0001) without weight loss. The inhibition of pY1604 ALK was evaluated in these tumors (8 hrs post dose); \u003e80% pALK inhibition was observed at the lowest doses tested, and complete inhibition was seen at doses of 30 mg/kg and above. In a direct comparison, members of this series achieved ALK inhibition in these tumors at a 15 fold lower plasma concentration than crizotinib. A PK/PD time course study was performed in the Karpas-299 model. A single 60 mg/kg dose of an inhibitor was able to maintain \u003e90% ALK inhibition in tumors up to 24 hours post-dose, indicating significant tumor penetration and sustained ALK kinase inhibition. In conclusion, the described compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of ALK kinase, possess an impressive efficacy profile and drug-like pharmacokinetic properties. These features together indicate the potential for significant advantages over crizotinib. There is a compelling case for their clinical evaluation in patients with ALK-driven cancers.","title":"Characterization of a novel series of potent, selective inhibitors of wild type and mutant/fusion anaplastic lymphoma kinase","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1795"}
