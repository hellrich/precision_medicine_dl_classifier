We report a case of severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after administration of the first dose of Brentuximab Vedotin in a 64-yr-old patient with relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). To our knowledge, this is the first case of CRS to Brentuximab Vedotin described in the literature. However, CRS to Brentuximab Vedotin might be underestimated, as the drug has not been tested in large phase III trials yet.
