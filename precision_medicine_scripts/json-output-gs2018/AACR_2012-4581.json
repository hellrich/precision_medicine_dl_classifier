Pim-1 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Notably, it is overexpressed downstream of FLT3 with internal tandem duplication (ITD), present in 30% of AML cases and associated with adverse treatment outcomes. SGI-1776 is the only Pim inhibitor in clinical testing to date, but testing was discontinued due to QTc prolongation. SGI-1776 has been used in laboratory studies of AML, but is also a FLT3 inhibitor, and effects of Pim-1 and FLT3 inhibition have been difficult to distinguish, particularly in cells with FLT3-ITD. To better characterize the effects of Pim-1 inhibition in AML, we compared SGI-1776 (from SuperGen, Inc., Dublin, CA) with two Pim inhibitors without FLT3 inhibitory activity, SMI-4a and quercetagetin in FLT3-wt and FLT3-ITD cells in 96-hour WST-1 cell viability, flow cytometric cell cycle and apoptosis, colony formation and liquid culture proliferation assays. SGI-1776 had no effect on cell cycle in FLT3-wt cells at concentrations up to 5 M, and caused apoptosis at 10 M, while G1 arrest and apoptosis occurred at 100 nM in FLT3-ITD cells, and SMI-4a and quercetagetin did not alter cell cycle nor induce apoptosis in FLT3-wt nor FLT3-ITD cell lines. IC50 (M) comparisons are summarized below: In liquid culture assays, all three Pim inhibitors slowed proliferation of all cell lines, indicating a cytostatic effect. Thus FLT3 inhibition plays a substantial role in the cellular effects of SGI-1776, and Pim inhibitors without FLT3 inhibitory activity appear to have primarily cytostatic effects in AML cells. Other Pim kinase inhibitors in development should be characterized with regard to pro-apoptotic versus cytostatic effects.","title":"Pim-1 kinase inhibition in the absence of FLT3 inhibition results in cytostatic effects in acute myeloid leukemia cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-4581"}
