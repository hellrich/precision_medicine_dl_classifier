One hundred and seventeen primary melanomas and 18 metastatic tissue samples were analysed for immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, Bcl-2 and p53. The staining results were correlated with disease progression and clinical outcome. The patient population comprised patients diagnosed with melanoma between 1988 and 1991. The clinical follow-up period for disease recurrence was 4.6 years (median; range, 0.2-7.5 years) and the follow-up period for overall survival was 10.0 years (median; range, 8.6-15.6 years). Ki-67 expression was not a prognostic factor in primary melanoma. High Bcl-2 expression was associated with such adverse prognostic factors as male gender, old age of the patient and tumour ulceration. High Bcl-2 expression was also associated with an adverse prognosis in intermediate-thickness (1.01-4.0 mm) melanomas (n\u003d52) for disease-free (P\u003d0.09) and overall (P\u003d0.08) survival. In multivariate analysis, tumour thickness was the strongest prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P\u003c0.01). High p53 expression indicated a poorer prognosis (P\u003d0.05). In metastatic melanoma, the expression levels of Bcl-2 and p53 were lower than those in their primary counterparts (P\u003d0.08 for each). Ki-67 expression showed no remarkable changes. It can be concluded that high p53 expression in tumour cells is associated with a poorer prognosis in primary melanoma, and high Bcl-2 expression in tumour cells is an adverse prognostic marker in intermediate-thickness primary melanoma.","title":"Ki-67, Bcl-2 and p53 expression in primary and metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"16179864"}
