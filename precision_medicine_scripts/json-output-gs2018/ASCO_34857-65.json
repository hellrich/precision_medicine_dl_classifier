Although the incidence of BC is lower in Arab women it is diagnosed in younger age and seems to have worse prognosis. Recent data have suggested considerable molecular differences in BC from various ethnical groups. Molecular features are increasingly used for predicting cancer prognosis and response to treatment. The purpose of this study to compare clinical, pathological and molecular characteristics of BC in Arab and Jewish women in the Upper Galilee Methods: The files of 481 patients (pts) with breast cancer (BC) treated at the Oncology Institute, Ziv Medical Center between 2001 and 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. Type of breast operation and both clinical and all pathological findings of patients were summarized and correlated to the ethnicity of women. Results: Of the total 481 pts 380 were Jewish and 100 were Arab women. The main age at diagnosis was 49,4 years for Arabs and 59,5 years for Jews (p\u003c0,01). At diagnosis 3% of Arab pts had DCIS compared to 7,4% in Jewish pts, stage I in 19% and 49,9%, stage II in 36% and 31,7%, stage III in 33,3% and 7,6%, stage IV in 9% and 3,7% of Arab and Jewish pts respectively (p\u003c0,05). Well differentiated, moderately and poorly differentiated in 12%, 59% and 29% compared with 43,9%, 41,4% and 12,5% in Arabs versus Jews. Estrogen receptor was 69% in Arabs and 79% in Jews. HER-2 overexpression evaluated by IHC and CISH was diagnosed in 39% of Arab pts and in 24% Jewish pts (p\u003c0,05). Lumpectomy was done in 36% in Arabs versus 64% in Jews (p\u003c0,05). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate younger age and more advanced tumor at diagnosis in Arab compared to Jewish women. All pathological and molecular figures were more aggressive in Arab compared to Jewish women in Israel. Mammography for screening may be started at age 40 years in Arab women and treatment could be more aggressive.","title":"Clinical and pathological features of breast cancer in Arab compared to Jewish women in Northern Israel.","pubmedId":"ASCO_34857-65"}
