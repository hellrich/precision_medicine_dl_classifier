The probes used were EGFR gene, c-Ha-ras, v-Ki-ras, N-ras, c-myc, v-myb, v-fos, c-erbB-2, v-erbA, v-abl and v-fes. Amplification of the EGFR gene was detected in only one poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Amplifications of c-myc gene and c-erbB-2 gene were each observed in two well differentiated adenocarcinomas. One of these tumors had coamplification of c-erbB-2 and c-erbA genes but there were no amplifications nor rearrangements of other oncogenes. The poorly differentiated adenocarcinom with amplified EGFR gene also showed enhanced expression of EGFR gene by Northern blot analysis and additionally had strong synchronous immunoreactivity for EGFR and EGF.","title":"Amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and oncogenes in human gastric carcinomas.","pubmedId":"2570489"}
