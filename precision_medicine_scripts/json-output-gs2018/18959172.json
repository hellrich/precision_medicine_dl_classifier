Regarding some prognostic factors, it is possible today to classify prostate cancer patients into several risk groups for clinical and biochemical relapse, and therefore to choose the right treatment modality.\nThe objective in our study was to analyze the impact of tumour stage and grade, previous transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR), initial prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and age on disease relapse after radical radiotherapy of the prostate cancer.\nBetween January 1991 and December 2005, a clinical, retrospective study was performed at the Radiotherapy Department of the Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, which included 283 patients with prostate cancer treated only with radical radiotherapy. During regular followup we analyzed response to treatment and disease relapse.\nAfter radical radiotherapy disease relapse more often occurred (with statistical significance) in patients with locally advanced tumour (stage C 35% vs. A 13% vs. B 19%), low tumour grade (grade III 38% vs. grade II 23% vs. grade I 17%), initial PSA level over 10 ng/ml (29%) and over 20 ng/ml (37%) compared to 11% in the patients with initial PSA level below 10 ng/ml, and patients of lower age (less than 55 years 50% vs. 16% in patients over 70 years).\nTumour stage C, low tumour grade (grade II-III), initial PSA level over 10 ng/ml (over 20 ng/ml) and younger age are poor prognostic factors for disease relapse. In this case, radiotherapy as monotherapy is not an adequate approach, and it needs to be combined with other therapeutic modalities.","title":"[Disease relapses after radical radiotherapy of prostate cancer--analysis of prognostic factors].","pubmedId":"18959172"}
