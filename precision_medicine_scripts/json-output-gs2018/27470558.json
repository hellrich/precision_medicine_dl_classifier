However the prognostic value of PTEN deletion in prostate cancer patient\u0027s diagnosis and the mechanism of PTEN deletion in prostate cancer development still remain unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 26 published studies including 8097 prostate cancer patients was performed.\nCompared to PTEN normal patients, PTEN deletion patients showed a higher aggressive Gleason score(OR: 1.284, 95%CI\u003d1.145-1.439) and pathological stage(OR: 1.628, 95%CI\u003d1.270-2.087) which generally had a higher risk in prostate replace(HR: 1.738, 95%CI\u003d1.264-2.390). Significant association between PTEN deletion and ERG rearrangements in prostate cancer development was also proved that compared to PTEN normal patients, patients with PTEN deletion showed a higher risk in ERG rearrangements(OR: 1.345, 95%CI\u003d1.102-1.788).\nThis study indicated that patients with PTEN deletion were associated with higher pathological stage or Gleason score and a higher risk in prostate cancer replace potentially represent a novel clinically relevant event to identify individuals at increased risk for the occurrence, progression and prognosis of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer patients with PTEN deletion usually had a higher risk in ERG rearrangements than other patients may be a potential new area for identifying poor prognosis patients and selecting patients for targeted therapies which required confirmation through adequately designed prospective studies.","title":"The association of Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion and prostate cancer risk: A meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"27470558"}
