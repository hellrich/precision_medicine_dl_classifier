Although many human cancers such as melanoma express tumor antigens recognized by T cells, host immune responses often fail to control tumor growth for mostly unexplained reasons. Escaping immune destruction is one of the tenets of tumorigenesis; there have been several studies suggesting an important role of PD-1/PD-L1 (B7-H1) interactions in inhibiting the effector functions of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte in tumor. Ghebeh et al., reported that doxorubicin treatment caused decrease in cytosolic B7-H1 and increased nuclear translocalization in breast carcinoma (Breast Cancer Res. 2010;12(4):R48). It is unknown whether differential cellular expression of PD-L1 contributes to the pathogenesis of melanoma. To address the role of PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1 in different stages of malignant melanoma, we have performed semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 and PD-1 in benign nevi (n\u003d59), primary melanomas without metastasis (n\u003d22) or with metastasis (n\u003d17), and melanoma metastases (n\u003d32 cases). Benign nevi had significantly higher levels of nuclear PD-L1 immunopositivity (p\u003d0.004) and low levels of PD-1 protein expression (p\u003d0.002). With progression from benign nevi to primary melanoma there was an increase in cytoplasmic positivity for PD-L1 (p\u003d0.03). Also, a significant positive correlation was observed between the percentage of positive cells (p\u003d0.0007) and intensity (p\u003d0.0009) for PD-1 in primary melanomas. Although there was no significant difference in PD-1 levels in between primaries with or without metastasis, a trend was observed for PD-L1 expression: primaries with metastasis having a larger number of tumor cells with cytosolic localization than primaries without metastasis (p\u003d0.07). Interestingly, primary melanomas without metastasis showed significantly larger number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) cells having intense immunoreactivity for PD-L1 protein than did metastatic melanomas (p\u003d0.03). In conclusion, differential cellular localization of PD-L1 protein and high levels of PD-1 protein correlates with disease progression and high-risk histologic features in melanoma and might partially explain the resistance of melanoma cells against the immune system.","title":"Differential cellular localization of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and enhanced expression of programmed death-1 (PD-1) in melanoma progression.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-463"}
