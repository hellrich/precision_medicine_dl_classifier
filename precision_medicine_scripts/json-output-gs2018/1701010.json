Masses in the bilateral adrenal glands were noted on abdominal ultrasonography and the patient was admitted to the hospital on August 9, 1988. Upon test laparotomy, non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma (diffuse small-cell type, B-cell type) was diagnosed, and endocrinological examination revealed hypofunction of the adrenal gland. The results of various tests showed absence of distance metastasis except for that to the bilateral adrenal glands. Since complete remission was attained after 2 courses of COP-BLAM III therapy, and adrenal function also became normal, the patient was discharged on January 9, 1989. Malignant lymphoma originating from the adrenal gland seems to be a rare condition, and only 16 cases have been reported to this date.","title":"[Massive bilateral non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma of the adrenal glands].","pubmedId":"1701010"}
