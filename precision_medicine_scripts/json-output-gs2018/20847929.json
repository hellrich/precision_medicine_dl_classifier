Furthermore, the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor appears to have a low incidence of cardiotoxicity, and may decrease the rate of later brain metastases. Therefore, several cooperative groups and academic centers have initiated trials investigating lapatinib in the treatment of early-stage ErbB2 (HER2)-overexpressing breast cancer.","title":"Future Roles of Lapatinib in ErbB2-Positive Breast Cancer: Adjuvant and Neoadjuvant Trials.","pubmedId":"20847929"}
