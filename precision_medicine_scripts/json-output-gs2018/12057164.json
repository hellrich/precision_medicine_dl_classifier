The low incidence of this disease prevents therapeutic questions from being addressed in prospective randomized trials. As such, treatment algorithms have generally been extrapolated from those used in female breast cancer. Similar to female breast cancer, lymph node involvement and the size of the primary tumor are the most important factors in predicting disease-free and overall survival. Modified radical mastectomy remains the standard local therapeutic approach, with radiation therapy indicated for patients who have clinicopathologic features associated with a high risk for postmastectomy chest wall or lymph node recurrence. Similar to female breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy is indicated in the majority of men with breast cancer, specifically those with tumors larger than 1 cm or those with lymph node-positive disease.","title":"Carcinoma of the male breast.","pubmedId":"12057164"}
