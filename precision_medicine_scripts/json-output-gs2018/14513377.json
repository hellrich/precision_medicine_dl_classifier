Brought into a tissue microarray (TMA) format were 101 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded posterior uveal melanomas. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the polyclonal anti-CD117 antibody from Dako (A4502). In ten selected KIT-positive tumors, exons 2, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 17 were sequenced. Of the 101 cases, 89 (88%) could be evaluated on the TMAs. Immunohistochemistry for CD 117 was weakly positive in 5 cases (6%), moderately positive in 10 cases (12%) and strongly positive in 57 cases (69%). No KIT mutations were detected in the analyzed exons. In conclusion, human posterior uveal melanoma frequently expresses CD117 at high levels. Although KIT mutations could not be found, it appears justified to investigate the utility of imatinib mesylate in the treatment of these patients.","title":"Sequence analysis and high-throughput immunohistochemical profiling of KIT (CD 117) expression in uveal melanoma using tissue microarrays.","pubmedId":"14513377"}
