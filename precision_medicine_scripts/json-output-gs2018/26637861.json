Adducin 3 (ADD3) is a cytoskeletal protein associated with chemoresistance but its role in glioblastoma has not been investigated.\nUsing an in vitro model of glioblastoma cells with acquired temozolomide resistance (D54-MG-R), the expressions of ADD3 and cancer stem cell markers were compared to those in temozolomide-sensitive glioblastoma cells (D54-MG-S). Immunofluorescence staining was used to investigate the expression patterns of ADD3 and cancer stem cell markers in temozolomide resistance and neurospheres of glioblastoma.\nChemoresistant cells were found to have up-regulation of ADD3 and CD133 expression. A sub-population of D54-MG-R cells and glioma neurospheres exhibited coexpression of ADD3 with CD133.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of a possible link between cytoskeletal protein expression, cancer stem cell phenotype and temozolomide resistance in human glioblastoma. This report lays the foundation for further investigation for ADD3 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in temozolomide-resistant glioma cells.","title":"Co-expression of Cytoskeletal Protein Adducin 3 and CD133 in Neurospheres and a Temozolomide-resistant Subclone of Glioblastoma.","pubmedId":"26637861"}
