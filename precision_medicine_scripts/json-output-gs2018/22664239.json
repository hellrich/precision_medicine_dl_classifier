Initially, MAGE-I proteins were considered as selective targets for immunotherapy. More recently, emerging data obtained from different cellular mechanisms controlled by MAGE-I proteins suggest a key role in the regulation of important pathways linked to cell proliferation. This is in part due to the ability of some MAGE-I proteins to control the p53 tumor suppressor. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms proposed to explain how MAGE-I proteins affect p53 functions.","title":"Tumor-specific MAGE proteins as regulators of p53 function.","pubmedId":"22664239"}
