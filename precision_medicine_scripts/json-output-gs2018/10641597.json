About 40 to 50% of cases diagnosed as ALCL contain a specific chromosomal rearrangement, t(2;5)(p23;q35), resulting in expression of the chimeric tyrosine kinase NPM-ALK. As NPM-ALK-positive lymphomas define a distinct subtype within the group of ALCL, the chimeric protein might be responsible for certain pathogenetic and clinicopathologic characteristics. To better elucidate the function of NPM-ALK, we investigated a possible mechanism for regulation of its activity. We demonstrate that NPM-ALK specifically binds to the intracellular domain of the cytokine receptor CD30. In vitro binding assays revealed that the ALK portion of NPM-ALK mediates interaction of the two proteins. Stimulation of the CD30 receptor by cross-linking with immobilized anti-CD30 antibody results in complete growth inhibition of Karpas 299, an NPM-ALK-positive ALCL cell line, but does not alter proliferation of HDLM-2, a Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma-derived cell line lacking t(2;5). Western blot analysis of coimmunoprecipitated CD30 and NPM-ALK proteins from stimulated Karpas 299 cells showed that the interaction of the proteins is not modified by stimulation. Activation of CD30 neither enhanced NPM-ALK activity measured by autophosphorylation of the chimeric tyrosine kinase nor phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma, an NPM-ALK substrate. We conclude that NPM-ALK is not stimulated by CD30 activation, but exists as a constitutively hyperactivated protein. Interaction with CD30 may extend the subcellular localization of NPM-ALK to the microenvironment of membrane-associated proteins.","title":"The tyrosine kinase NPM-ALK, associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma, binds the intracellular domain of the surface receptor CD30 but is not activated by CD30 stimulation.","pubmedId":"10641597"}
