In addition, the prognostic implications of clinicopathologic parameters were evaluated.\nPatients who had MGC had deeper invasion (P\u003d.003), more frequent lymph node metastasis (P\u003c.001), more advanced pathologic stage (P\u003c.001), more frequent lymphatic invasion (P\u003c.001), and lower disease-specific survival rates (P\u003c.0001) than patients who had NMGC. However, a mucinous histology per se was not identified as an independent prognostic factor. Negative mucin 1, cell surface associated (MUC1) status (P\u003c.001); positive mucin 2, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming (MUC2) status (P\u003c.001); negative mucin 5AC, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming (MUC5AC) status (P\u003d.036); and negative mucin 6, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming (MUC6) status (P\u003c.001) were more frequent in MGCs. The frequency of MSI in MGC was not significantly different from that in NMGC. MGCs had a significantly lower incidence of HER-2 protein overexpression (P\u003d.046), HER-2 gene amplification (P\u003d.009), and EGFR protein overexpression (P\u003d.017) than NMGCs; and multivariate analysis identified EGFR overexpression as a factor associated with a poor prognosis (P\u003d.047). Patients with MGC who had a predominance of signet ring cells in mucin pools had poorer disease-specific survival than patients who had MGC with predominant tubular differentiation (P\u003d.017).\nThe clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of MGCs differed from those of NMGCs. Furthermore, the results indicated that EGFR overexpression and histologic subtyping by predominant tumor cell type in mucin pools may be helpful for predicting clinical outcome in patients with MGC.","title":"Mucinous gastric carcinomas: clinicopathologic and molecular analyses.","pubmedId":"19479974"}
