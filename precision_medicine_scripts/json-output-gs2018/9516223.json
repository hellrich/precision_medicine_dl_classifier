Whether mutations in CDKN2A confer a predisposition to sporadic (nonfamilial) melanoma is not known. In some patients with sporadic melanoma, one or more additional primary lesions develop, suggesting that some of these patients have an underlying genetic susceptibility to the cancer. We hypothesized that this predisposition might be due to germ-line CDKN2A mutations.\nWe used the polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and direct DNA sequencing to identify germ-line mutations in the CDKN2A gene in patients with multiple primary melanomas who did not have family histories of the disease. A quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the functional importance of the CDKN2A variants.\nOf 33 patients with multiple primary melanomas, 5 (15 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 percent to 27 percent) had germ-line CDKN2A mutations. These included a 24-bp insertion at the 5\u0027 end of the coding sequence, three missense mutations (Arg24Pro, Met53Ile, and Ser56Ile), and a 2-bp deletion at position 307 to 308 (resulting in a truncated CDKN2A protein). In three families, CDKN2A mutations identical to those in the probands were found in other family members. In two families with mutations, we uncovered previously unknown evidence of family histories of melanoma.\nSome patients with multiple primary melanomas but without family histories of the disease have germ-line mutations of the CDKN2A gene. The presence of multiple primary melanomas may signal a genetic susceptibility to melanoma not only in the index patient but also in family members, who may benefit from melanoma-surveillance programs.","title":"CDKN2A mutations in multiple primary melanomas.","pubmedId":"9516223"}
