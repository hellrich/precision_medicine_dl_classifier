We evaluated 54 chronic-phase CML patients treated with imatinib who switched therapy to dasatinib (n \u003d 33) or nilotinib (n \u003d 21). BCR-ABL1 transcript levels were measured in peripheral blood using real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) every 3 months from the start of second-line treatment. Patients with BCR-ABL transcript levels \u003e10% at 3 months and \u003e1% at 6 months had significantly inferior progression-free (PFS) and event-free survival (EFS) than patients with RQ-PCR \u003c10% at 3 months and \u003c1% at 6 months (66 vs. 100%, p \u003d 0.01, and 33 vs. 73%, p \u003d 0.02, respectively). Patients with RQ-PCR \u003c10% at 3 months and \u003e1% at 6 months also had inferior PFS and EFS than patients with RQ-PCR \u003c10% at 3 months and \u003c1% at 6 months (48 vs. 100%, p \u003d 0.002, and 25 vs. 73%, p \u003c 0.0001, respectively). Two measurements of BCR-ABL levels were better than a single one to stratify chronic-phase CML patients as failure after second-line therapy.","title":"BCR-ABL1 Transcript Levels at 3 and 6 Months Are Better for Identifying Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients with Poor Outcome in Response to Second-Line Second-Generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors after Imatinib Failure: A Report from a Single Institution.","pubmedId":"26159458"}
