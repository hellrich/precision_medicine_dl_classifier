Patients with poor-risk tumors by the international classification system have about a 50% likelihood of long-term survival. No randomized trial has proved a chemotherapy regimen to be superior to that of four courses of combination bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. Ongoing research is evaluating the role of high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as initial therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and poor-risk GCT. Newer agents such as gemcitabine and paclitaxel have shown promise and may be incorporated in future chemotherapeutic regimens. We review the major prognostication systems, areas of research directed at improving treatment outcome, and approaches that will improve understanding and management of these neoplasms in the future.","title":"Advanced germ cell tumors in male patients.","pubmedId":"11095552"}
