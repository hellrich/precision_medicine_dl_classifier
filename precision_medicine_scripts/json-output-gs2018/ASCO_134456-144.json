Trials exploring interruption of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling showed benefit in several cancer types, but the complexity of PD-L1 expression and patterns of PD-1 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) make development of the predictive biomarker challenging. We analyzed distribution of PD-1+ lymphocytes and PD-L1 expressing tumor cells in common cancer types and their association with other cancer characteristics.  Methods:    339 carcinomas  (lung, breast, prostate, colon, ovary, endometrium, kidney, liver, bladder, pancreas) and 24 melanomas were profiled (Caris Life Sciences) using immunohistochemistry, in-situ hybridization and next generation sequencing (Illumina TruSeq panel).  Results:  PD-1+ lymphocytes are consistently identified in reactive, peri-tumoral lymphoid follicles, but intra-tumoral PD-1+ lymphocytes in direct cell-to-cell contact with cancer cells were less common (e.g. 50% of breast cancers, 58% melanomas and 75% of NSCLC). PD-L1 was consistently detected in tumor microenvironment (endothelium, macrophages, myofibroblasts), but specific cancer cells expression of PD-L1 was less common (e.g. 43% BrCA, 52% NSCLC, 21% sporadic CRC), except in melanomas which were PD-L1+ in 92% of cases. Intra-tumoral PD-1+ TILs and PD-L1+ cancer cells were co-present in 58% melanomas, 44% NSCLC, 28% breast carcinomas and 8% CRC. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) were frequently PD-L1 positive (59% all TNBC and 100% in metaplastic TNBC). In NSCLC, PD-1+/PD-L1+ tumors were mostly seen in the absence of targetable genetic abnormality (i.e. EGFR, ALK and ROS1 negative).  Conclusions:  The study provides useful guidance for evaluation of PD-1 and PD-L1 as potential biomarkers for clinical trials as well as their frequency distribution in different types of malignancies. Not all patients respond to immunotherapy and intratumoral PD-1+ TILs and cancer specific PD-L1 expression may be required for the potential benefit to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy.","title":"Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) in common cancers and their correlation with molecular cancer type.","pubmedId":"ASCO_134456-144"}
