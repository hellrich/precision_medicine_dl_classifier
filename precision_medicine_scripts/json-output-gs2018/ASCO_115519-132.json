The list of  targetable lesions is rapidly increasing including mutations in genes such as EGFR, HER2, KRAS, ALK, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT1, ROS1, NRAS, FGFR1 and MAP2K1. Analysis of these potential targets is becoming a challenge in terms of work load, tissue availability as well as cost.  Within the Network Genomic Medicine Lung Cancer (NGM), a regional molecular screening network of the Center for Integrated Oncology Kln Bonn, we aimed to improve the sequential analysis of a set of 9 target amplicons by Sanger sequencing using bench top ultra-deep parallel sequencing platforms. We aimed to reduce 1) the time requirement for comprehensive molecular diagnostics, 2) the minimal amount of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) derived input DNA, 3) while at the same time increasing the number of target regions analysed.  Methods:   We established a multiplex PCR to amplify up to 640 lung cancer relevant target regions from at least 20ng of FFPE derived tumor DNA. The amplicon libraries were ligated to adapters encompassing medical identifier sequences that allowed multiplexing of up to 48 patients. The resulting libraries were sequenced on a benchtop Illumina platform (MiSeq). Mutations identified by parallel sequencing were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.  Results:  330 patients were analyzed by traditional Sanger sequencing of 9 amplicons and the newly established parallel sequencing protocol. The time needed to complete the mutation screening was significantly reduced to 7 working days from previously 21 days. A total of at least 300ng of DNA was needed to complete the analysis of 9 amplicons by Sanger sequencing compared to 20 to 100ng of DNA needed for up to 640 amplicons analyzed by parallel sequencing.  Conclusions:  Newly multiplex PCR based parallel sequencing allows rapid comprehensive mutation testing in routine molecular pathological diagnostics even on small transbronchial biopsies.","title":"High-throughput parallel amplicon sequencing of common driver mutations from FFPE lung cancer samples in molecular pathologic routine diagnostics for a regional health care provider network.","pubmedId":"ASCO_115519-132"}
