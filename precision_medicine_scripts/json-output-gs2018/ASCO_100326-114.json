Myc and MAPK are key downstream components of the EGFR pathway and have significant roles in cell survival, proliferation, and growth. The purpose of this study is to determine the prognostic value of  EGFR,  ErbB2,  ErbB3, ErbB4, Myc and MAPK  by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in early stage NSCLC. Methods:  109 NSCLC were evaluated: median age was 67 years (range 4084); Male/Female:93/16; squamous (SCC)/adenocarcinoma (ADC)/BAC/other: 52/36/3/18; smoker/never smoker:100/9, and stage I/II/III:67/17/25.  The tumors with 10% positive cells were classified positive, further confirmed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival and time to recurrence were calculated for clinical and biologic variables using Cox model for multivariate analysis  Results:  EGFR and EbrB3 were associated with SCC (p\u003c0.0001 and p\u003d0.004, respectively) whereas ErbB2 and Myc with ADC (p\u003d0.004 and p\u003c0.0001, respectively) . EGFR and ErbB3 were significantly associated (p\u003d0.003), as well as MAPK and ErbB4 (p\u003d0.02). At  a median follow-up of 75 months the contemporary overexpression of EGFR, ErbB2 and MAPK was associated with shorter disease free survival (DFS) (HR\u003d5.4, p\u003d0.002)  and overall survival (OS) (HR\u003d8.9, p\u003c0.0001). At multivariate analysis adjusting for stage, the co-expression of EGFR, ErbB2 and MAPK was an independent predictor for worse DFS and OS (HR\u003d5.7, p\u003d0.004; HR\u003d8.67, p\u003c0.001, respectively).  Conclusions:  Our results suggest that in early stage NSCLC, the co-expression of EGFR, ErbB2 and MAPK  predicted a worse prognosis. ErbB3, ErbB4 and Myc were not prognostic factors. Such features may have important implications for future targeted therapies.
