The frequencies of methylation in CRC vary according to clinico-pathological characteristics including sex. However, interaction between these characteristics and prognostic influence of methylation status has not been clearly defined. We have investigated the prognostic role of promoter methylation using eight CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) markers in 497 stage II or III CRC patients who underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant FOLFOX. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between subgroups classified by methylation status, and interactions with clinico-pathological features were analyzed.\nCIMP-high (≥5 methylated loci) and concurrent methylation in NEUROG1 and CDKN2A (p16) were found in 5.8 and 7.9 % of patients, respectively. Although CIMP-high status was not associated with survival, concurrent methylation in NEUROG1 and CDKN2A (p16) was associated with shorter OS and DFS. Moreover, the prognostic role of the concurrent methylation was different among sex. The negative prognostic impact was only observed in male but not in female (interaction p value \u003d 0.026 for OS and 0.011 for DFS). In male, the 5-year OS was 61.6 % in concurrent methylation (+) and 91.7 % in concurrent methylation (-) (p \u003c 0.001) whereas it was 95.0 and 92.8 % in female, respectively (p \u003d 0.78).\nConcurrent methylation in NEUROG1 and CDKN2A is associated with poor survival in CRC treated with adjuvant FOLFOX. Interaction analysis indicates that the prognostic role is different according to sex.","title":"Different prognostic effect of CpG island methylation according to sex in colorectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant FOLFOX.","pubmedId":"26157509"}
