She was treated with chemo-radiotherapy (5-FU/CDDP therapy and irradiation) initially, and primary lesion was well controlled. Two and a half years after first treatment, a chest CT showed multiple lung metastasis, which were confirmed by thoraco-laparoscopy. We chose docetaxel/CDDP combination chemotherapy, because of severe side effects due to the first treatment. After 3 courses, lung metastatic lesions were reduced. The following courses combining docetaxel-nedaplatin were done as ambulatory treatment. These regimens could be one choice for recurrent esophageal cancer, especially FP therapy-resistant or intolerant cases.","title":"[A case of recurrent esophageal cancer with lung metastases successfully treated with docetaxel-combination chemotherapy].","pubmedId":"16685166"}
