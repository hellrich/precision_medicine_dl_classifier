Matched serum and PBMC samples have been collected from 10 melanoma patients with durable responses to treatment with ipilimumab. A panel of 7 well characterized melanoma cell lines with a diverse set of oncogenic driver mutations has been employed to assess durable responder patient serum reactivity to cell surface determinants in a live-cell flow cytometry assay. IgG+ memory B cells obtained from several prioritized durable responder melanoma patients have been plated out on 384 well plates at monoclonal density. The memory B cells have been activated in a short term culture system optimized to expand the clonal B cells and induce secretion of IgG. Antibodies secreted from clonally expanded B cells have been screened using live cell high throughput multiplex flow cytometry assays against a panel of melanoma cell lines. A prioritized subset of antibodies, selected on the basis of tumor cell line binding profiles and antibody v-region sequences, has been cloned and expressed as recombinant IgG1. A cell surface target for a prioritized antibody has been identified and the in vitro analysis and characterization of the antibody including functional activity and immunohistochemistry staining on tumor and normal tissues has been carried out in preparation for in vivo testing of efficacy.","title":"Derivation and characterization of antibodies from immune checkpoint blockade treated cancer patients","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-870"}
