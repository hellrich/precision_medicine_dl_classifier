As a most commonly used marker for prostate cancer detection, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has a high organic but a low carcinomatous specificity, and its clinical application value needs to be reestimated. Many studies have been devoted to the finding of new markers for prostate cancer and some achievements already obtained. This article approaches the markers for prostate cancer in three aspects, DNA, RNA and protein, hoping to offer a new insight into the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.","title":"[An update of the markers for prostate cancer].","pubmedId":"20608359"}
