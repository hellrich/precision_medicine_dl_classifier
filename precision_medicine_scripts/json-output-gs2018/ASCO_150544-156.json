Immunotherapy based on disruption of immune checkpoints, such as Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Programmed Death 1 (PD-1), has been showed promising results. Interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 down-regulates antitumor activity and could be involved in resistance to anti-VEGF therapies  Methods:    In this study, we assessed PD-L1 and PD-1 expressions by immunohistochemistry in primary ccRCC of metastatic patients with sunitinib first-line treatment. From 2 centers, 92 patients were restrospectively included and clinical data were collected with a median follow up of 22 months after sunitinib introduction. PD-L1 immunostaining was evaluated on the highest Fuhrman grade areas (n \u003d 92) and PD-1 on the most inflammatory territory when the corresponding block was available (n \u003d 47). PD-L1 and PD-1 were considered overexpressed when moderate to intense membranous tumor cells staining and moderate to marked tumor infiltrating lymphocytes staining were observed, respectively.  Results:    Patients with PD-L1 overexpression (n \u003d 65/92, 71%) had significantly shorter progression free survival (PFS) compared to other patients (median 10 vs 19 months, p \u003d 0.01). There was also a trend toward a worse overall survival (OS) (median 18 vs 26 months, p \u003d 0.24).In the subgroup with PD-1 results available, patients with both PD-L1 and PD-1 overexpressions (n \u003d 17/47) had an even shorter PFS (median 9 vs 19 months, p \u003d 0.001), and a comparable OS (median 18 vs 32 months, p \u003d 0.2).  Conclusions:   This is the first study to assess both PD-L1 and PD-1 expressions in metastatic patients with sunitinib first-line treatment. Patients with PD-L1 as well as both PD-L1 and PD-1 overexpressions were associated with worse clinical outcomes, and should be individualized as having a peculiar immune phenotype. These patients experienced poor prognosis when treated by sunitinib and may benefit more from anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies.","title":"PDL-1 and PDL1 expressions in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) of metastatic patients with sunitinib first-line treatment.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150544-156"}
