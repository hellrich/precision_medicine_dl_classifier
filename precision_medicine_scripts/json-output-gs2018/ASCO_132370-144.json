However, the inter and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity for BRAF status has been described supporting the need for testing multiple sites for the same patient. Circulating DNA is considered a promising non-invasive tool for cancer monitoring. The objective of our work was to determine the potential of plasma DNA to detect BRAF mutations, particularly in patients presenting discordant BRAF status from different tumor sites.  Methods:  Plasma DNA was extracted using the iPrep PureLink Virus Kit on an iPrep purification system (Invitrogen). BRAF mutations were detected using the Therascreen BRAF RGQ kit (Qiagen).  Results:  Ninety-nine patients were included, and plasma was collected at baseline. Nine stage III melanoma patients presenting a mutant BRAF (6 V600E, 2 V600K and 1 V600D) were tested and for 4 of them we detected the corresponding mutation (including the V600D and both V600K) in circulating DNA (sensitivity 44.4 %). Similarly, 20 stage IV patients were tested (17 V600E, 2 V600K and 1 V600R). The corresponding mutation (including the V600R and both V600K) was detected in 15 of these patients (sensitivity 75.0%). Interestingly, 4 stage IV patients included in our series presented discordant BRAF mutation status on different sites (1 patient with a WT primary tumor (PT) and a V600E lymph node (LN) metastasis; 1 patient with a V600E PT and WT LN metastasis; 2 patients with a V600E PT, V600E LN and WT liver metastasis). We were able to detect the expected BRAF mutation in circulating DNA for all these patients.  Conclusions:  The sensitivity of our procedure, based on approved kits, suggests a high interest for use in clinical practice, even for non-V600E mutations. Plasma DNA might be less sensitive to heterogeneity between tumor samples, and therefore might represent an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations in clinical setting.","title":"BRAF mutation in circulating DNA of melanoma patients at baseline and intertumor heterogeneity.","pubmedId":"ASCO_132370-144"}
