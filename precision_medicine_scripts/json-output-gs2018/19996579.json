Imatinib has become the standard of care in other cancers with KIT mutations such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Recently 12 cases of metastatic melanoma and KIT-activating mutations have been published to be successfully treated with c-KIT blockers such as imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib or sorafenib. We report here on one of our patients with KIT-activating mutation in metastatic anal mucosal melanoma, who showed a response to imatinib therapy and summarize the available literature regarding this new therapeutic option.","title":"Anal mucosal melanoma with KIT-activating mutation and response to imatinib therapy--case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"19996579"}
