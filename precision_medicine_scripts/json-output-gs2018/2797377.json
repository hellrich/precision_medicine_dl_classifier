A 60-year-old male was admitted for examinations to discover the cause of his generalized tonic convulsions. On admission, he had neither neurological deficits, nor were there any abnormalities revealed during physical examination. Ct scan disclosed a slightly high-density mass with perifocal edema in the right parietal cortex which enhanced markedly after injection of contrast material. This lesion was hypointense on T1 weighted image of MRI (GE: 1.5 Tesla) and a hyperintense band was observed on the surface of the tumor. On T2 weighted image, the tumor showed iso-hypointensity surrounded by an increased signal area compatible with edema. On August 31, 1988, a gross total removal of the tumor was performed. Microscopically, it was identified as a malignant melanoma. No melanoma was found in other parts of the body during careful examinations, especially in dermatologic and ophthalmologic examinations. Characteristic findings of the hyperintense band on T1 weighted image coincided well with the pathological findings of excessive melanin deposition on the surface of the tumor, and which resulted from the paramagnetic free-radicals in the melanin. MR image may be useful for differentiation of intracranial malignant melanomas from other mass lesions.","title":"[A case of primary intracranial malignant melanoma with characteristic magnetic resonance imaging].","pubmedId":"2797377"}
