Given this, as well as the complexity of mechanisms involved in cancer in vivo, a more complete understanding of the development of resistance requires a closer look at the tumor ecosystem, including the microenvironment. Echoing this more comprehensive approach, a number of recent studies on BRAF-inhibitor resistance have brought our attention back to the tumor microenvironment, particularly through a focus on HGF-cMET signaling - a known means of stromal-parenchymal communication. Our review focuses on the results of these recent investigations, and through a review of relevant HGF-cMET past literature looks to provide a context by which to better understand the role of stromal-parenchymal signaling in BRAF resistance/melanoma progression.
