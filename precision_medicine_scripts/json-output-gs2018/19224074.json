To date, there have been about 140 cases reported in the literature. It is a rare variant of adenocarcinoma that usually occurs in the salivary glands. In contrast to the aggressive nature of adenoid cystic carcinoma that occurs in the head and neck region, adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast has a very favourable prognosis. Little has been published to date on its radiological features. We describe a 63-year-old woman with adenoid cystic carcinoma detected on mammography in our national breast screening programme, the radiological findings at presentation, the surgical management and a review of the literature.","title":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast.","pubmedId":"19224074"}
