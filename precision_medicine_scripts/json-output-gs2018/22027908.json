Data from the Melanoma Subscale (MS) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma and the worst pain question from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) were taken from a clinical trial evaluating intetumumab alone or with dacarbazine in Stage IV metastatic melanoma. Descriptive statistics examined patient-reported disease burden at baseline. Correlations explored clinical endpoint and HRQoL associations. Psychometrics included Cronbach\u0027s α internal consistency and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Treatment impact on HRQoL was evaluated through HRQoL maintenance and response analyses. Patients (n\u003d127) had a mean age of 62 years, a mean±SD hemoglobin of 13.0±2.6 g/dl, and a mean±SD lactic dehydrogenase of 394±454 IU/l. Ninety-eight percent were Caucasian, 67% were men, and 64% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0. Baseline BPI worst pain and MS scores (mean±SD) were 1.6±2.2 and 54.5±7.2, respectively. Top three patient-reported health decrements in the MS were appetite, fatigue, and limited physical activity. Observed HRQoL decrements were consistent with the literature. MS and BPI worst pain item demonstrated good psychometrics: Cronbach\u0027s α and ICC for the MS were 0.79 and 0.86, respectively; BPI ICC was 0.74. A trend for HRQoL response was observed 3 weeks postbaseline in the dacarbazine + 10 mg/kg intetumumab arm compared with dacarbazine + placebo: 22 versus 10%, respectively, for the MS; 23 versus 5% for the BPI. Further research on the HRQoL benefit of intetumumab in larger studies appears warranted.","title":"Health-related quality of life among patients with metastatic melanoma:  results from an international phase 2 multicenter study.","pubmedId":"22027908"}
