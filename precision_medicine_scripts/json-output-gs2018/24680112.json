In 70 to 80% of cases, the diagnosis is made at an advanced stage. Although the management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has continued to improve over the last 5 years, the prognosis remains poor with a 5-year survival rate of about 16%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the management of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in our patients and to analyze overall survival (OS) and prognostic factors at these stages.\nA retrospective study, including cases of locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC diagnosed in our department between 2008 and 2011.\nWe included 150 patients with a mean age of 60.2 years. The cancer was at stage IIIA in 21% of cases, IIIB in 14% of cases and IV in 65% of cases. Thoracic surgery was performed in 5 patients; 61.4% of patients received chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy was given in 21% of patients. Overall survival was 6 months. Better survival was observed in patients aged less than 60 years, having better performance status (PS), having no metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes and patients who received specific anti-tumor treatment.\nThe prognostic factors in locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC in our patients were: age, PS, status of mediastinal lymph nodes at diagnosis and treatment. These factors should be considered by physicians when treating patients with advanced stage NSCLC.","title":"[Treatment and prognosis of advanced stage non-small-cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"24680112"}
