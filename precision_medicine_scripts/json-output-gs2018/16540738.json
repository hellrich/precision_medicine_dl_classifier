Controversy exists as to the prognostic significance of EGFR gene amplification: some reports have indicated that amplification is associated with a poor prognosis, while other authors have reported no relationship between gene amplification and prognosis. Some reports have found a poor prognosis to be associated with amplification of the EGFR gene in patients of all ages with GBM, while other authors have found EGFR amplification to be an independent predictor of prolonged survival in patients with GBM who are older than 60 years of age. The authors studied a series of 34 specimens (32 patients) with histologically proven GBM by immunohistochemistry for the presence of EGFR overexpression and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for gene amplification of the EGFR gene. Results of these studies and data on patient age, sex, functional status, therapy, and survival were correlated to determine which variables were predictive of survival. p53 expression was also determined by immunohistochemistry and correlated with the other variables and survival.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification and protein expression in glioblastoma multiforme: prognostic significance and relationship to other prognostic factors.","pubmedId":"16540738"}
