However, lots of patients with both RAS and BRAF wild-type tumors determined by non-NGS testing might still not respond due to the presence of additional gene mutation such as PIK3CA or PTEN. Therefore, its necessary to screen mutations in genes other than RAS and BRAF on the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy. Besides, new available agents could potentially be used based on the other targetable alterations discovered. In this study, a broad, hybrid capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) assay was used to identify RAS, BRAF and additionally targetable genetic alterations from colorectal cancer tissue. Methods: 72 cases of colorectal cancers were enrolled and all the patients signed the informed consent before assay. 7708 exons of 508 tumor related genes and 78 introns of 19 frequently rearranged genes were assessed for base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. The average median sequencing depth was 450. Results: 50.4% (37/72) of the tumors harbored a KRAS mutation, 4.2% (3/72) harbored a NRAS mutation and 4.2% (3/72) harbored a BRAF mutation. More specifically, 82.5% (33/40) of RAS mutation was located in exon 2. Except for RAS and RAF, 4.2% (3/72) anti-EGFR therapy response genetic mutations were found in PTEN (n \u003d 3). Its also worth noting that actionable alterations were found in HER2 (n \u003d 5, including 4 amplification and 1 activating mutation), FBXW7 (n \u003d 3) and others (n \u003d 5). Conclusions: Our results implied that 63.9% (46/72) metastatic colorectal cancers with genetic mutations including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PTEN might not benefit from anti-EGFR therapy. 26.4% (19/72) of samples harbored at least one actionable genetic alteration rather than RAS identified by NGS testing. Significantly, HER2 defined a unique subpopulation of 6.9% (5/72) of metastatic colorectal cancer and might be a promising driven-gene. These findings suggest that high throughput NGS testing in colorectal cancer tissue was a comprehensive and efficient genomic profiling assay to guide personalized therapy.","title":"Broad, hybrid capture-based next generation sequencing guided personalized therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_164103-176"}
