Membranes prepared from neuronal cells contained mainly serotonin and beta 1-adrenergic-sensitive adenylate cyclases. However, a low but significant classical dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity (D1 receptor) was detected. Contrasting with the data obtained from a previous study on striatal neurons no adenosine-sensitive adenylate cyclase was found on mesencephalic neurons. Study on the additive effects of the 3 biogenic amines-sensitive adenylate cyclases indicated that: all neuronal cells having dopamine receptors possess beta 1-adrenergic receptors (no additivity); beta 1-adrenergic and serotonin receptors on the one hand, and dopamine and serotonin receptors on the other hand, were coupled with independent adenylate cyclase systems localized either on two different domains of the same cell or on different cells (complete additivity). Membranes prepared from primary mesencephalic cultures of glial cells contained a mixture of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes coupled with an adenylate cyclase (70% and 30%, respectively). No dopamine- or serotonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase was detected on mesencephalic glial cells.","title":"Biogenic amine-sensitive adenylate cyclases in primary culture of neuronal or glial cells from mesencephalon.","pubmedId":"6329463"}
