Pathologic expression of Snail contributes to the migratory capacity of invasive tumors, including melanomas. To investigate the mechanism of Snail up-regulation in human melanoma cells, a conserved enhancer located 3\u0027 of the Snail gene was analyzed. An overlapping Ets and yin yang 1 (YY1) consensus sequence, in addition to a SOX consensus sequence, was required for full enhancer activity. Proteins specifically binding these sequences were detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The Ets/YY1 binding activity was purified by DNA-affinity chromatography and identified as YY1. Although ubiquitously expressed, YY1 was bound at the Snail 3\u0027 enhancer in vivo in Snail-expressing cells but not in cells that did not express Snail. Knockdown of YY1 in A375 cells led to decreased Snail expression. These results identify a role for YY1 in regulating transcription of Snail in melanoma cells through binding to the Snail 3\u0027 enhancer.","title":"Yin yang 1 regulates the expression of snail through a distal enhancer.","pubmedId":"19208738"}
