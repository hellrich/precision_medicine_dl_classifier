Brain metastases are common, and rapidly fatal if untreated. Optimal management consists of resection and whole brain irradiation. However, there is a paucity of local data documenting survival after such treatment.\nMedical records for all patients who underwent complete resection of non-small-cell lung cancer at one institution between January 1999 and December 2003 were reviewed in order to determine survival after initial surgery. The survival of all patients was compared with patients who underwent resection of synchronous or metachronous brain metastases and whole brain irradiation as part of their lung cancer management.\nBetween 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2003, 170 patients underwent complete resection of non-small-cell lung cancer by a thoracic surgeon. Resection of synchronous or metachronous brain metastases followed by whole brain irradiation was also carried out on 15 of these patients. Complete cerebral resection was achieved in 12 cases. The overall 5-year survival after attempted curative resection of brain metastases and successful complete resection was 60% and 70%, respectively. The survival of patients with both cerebral metastasectomy and lung cancer resection approximated that of the cohort of patients that only required complete resection of their lung cancer.\nControl of local disease at each site and long-term survival after lung resection and resection of either synchronous or metachronous brain METASTASIS and whole brain irradiation is readily achievable. We believe this should continue as the standard of care for this presentation.","title":"Complete resection of non-small-cell lung cancer and oligo-metastatic brain disease.","pubmedId":"16336388"}
