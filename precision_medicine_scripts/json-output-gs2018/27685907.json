Compared with these cancers, gastric cancer is relatively resistant to cetuximab and its regulatory mechanism is still unclear.\nIn this study, we assessed whether the ubiquitin- proteasome pathway is involved in regulating cetuximab-induced cells apoptosis in MGC803 and BGC823 gastric cancer cell lines.\nThe casitas B lineage lymphoma-b (Cbl-b), a kind of E3 ubiquitin ligase, was involved in this process. Specific silenced Cbl-b expression increased the expression of EGFR.\nOur findings lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of cetuximab action, and suggests that Cbl-b increases the sensitivity of cetuximab in gastric cancer cells.","title":"Cbl-b regulates the sensitivity of cetuximab through ubiquitin-proteasome system in human gastric cancer cells.","pubmedId":"27685907"}
