Of 4 patients with stage IV malignant melanoma receiving systemic IFN-beta therapy alone, none showed any effective result (1MR, 3NC). Treatment with IFN-beta combined with chemotherapy, e.g. DTIC, produced a clinical improvement in 2 of 5 patients with malignant melanoma (1CR, 1PR, 2NC and 1PD). IFN-beta therapy has been performed by intravenous drip infusion concomitantly with chemotherapy before or after surgery, for prevention of metastasis in 4 cases of malignant melanoma (stage Ib, 1 case; stage II, 2 cases; stage III, 1 case). Three patients with stage Ib to II have been progressing favorably without metastasis over the past 3 years and 2 months. Patients receiving indomethacin suppositories for fever associated with IFN-beta therapy were examined for plasma and urinary IFN-beta activity levels. No significant difference was observed whether indomethacin was administered or not. Indomethacin is therefore considered to have no appreciable influence on IFN-beta therapy.","title":"[Therapeutic response of interferon-beta in malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"2421645"}
