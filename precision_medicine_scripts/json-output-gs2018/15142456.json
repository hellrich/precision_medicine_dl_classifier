It has been confirmed that C-erbB2 was related to ovarian carcinoma, but the relationship of C-erbB3 and C-erbB4 with ovarian carcinoma is unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship of expression of C-erbB2, C-erbB3, and C-erbB4 with ovarian carcinoma.\nStreptavidin-peroxidase immunohistochemistry method was used to determine the expression of C-erbB2, C-erbB3, and C-erbB4 in 49 cases of ovarian malignant neoplasms, 21 cases of ovarian benign neoplasms, and 19 cases of normal ovarian tissues (control), then the relationship of expression of C-erbB2, C-erbB3, C-erbB4 and clinicopathologic parameters in ovarian neoplasm was analyzed.\n(1) The positive expression rates of C-erbB2, C-erbB3, and C-erbB4 in ovarian malignant neoplasms were 75.51%, 69.39%, and 65.31%, respectively, and they were higher than that in ovarian benign neoplasms (19.05%, 23.81%, and 23.81%, respectively) and control (21.05%, 15.79%, and 21.05%, respectively)(P\u003c 0.05). (2) There was not significant difference between the expression of C-erbB2, C-erbB3, and C-erbB4 in ovarian malignant neoplasms and its pathologic type and grade (P \u003e0.05). (3) The positive expression rates of C-erbB2, C-erbB3, and C-erbB4 in the patients with late stage or large amount of ascetic volume ( \u003e500 ml) were 90.0% and 91.3%, respectively, and those also were higher than that in early stage or ascetic volume\u003c 500 ml (P\u003c 0.05). (4) The cumulative survival time of the patients with positive expression of C-erbB2 or C-erbB4 was longer than that without expression (P\u003c 0.01). The analysis of Cox model showed that expressions of C-erbB2 and C-erbB4 in ovarian malignant were also independent prognosis factors for ovarian cancer.\nThe C-erbB family would play an importation role in ovarian malignant neoplasms, and also was related to poor prognosis in ovarian cancer.","title":"[Relationship of expression of C-erbB2, C-erbB3, and C-erbB4 with ovarian carcinoma].","pubmedId":"15142456"}
