Tumors positive for C-erbB2 were 45.19% and 71.55% in ER positive group and ER negative group respectively, while tumors positive for C-erbB2 were 48.08% and 70.43% in PR positive group and PR negative group respectively. The expression of the C-erbB2 was 23.26% in group of PS2 positive and 50.75% in group of PS2 negative (P \u003c 0.05). No significant association of C-erbB2 expression with age and tumor size was noted(P \u003e 0.05), but its expression in breast cancer was correlated with advanced clinical stage, high histological grade, axillary lymph node involvement (P \u003c 0.05).\nC-erbB2 would be helpful to the evaluation of prognosis and treatment in breast cancer.","title":"[Relationship of oncogene C-erbB2 expression to ER, PR and PS2 in breast cancer and its prognostic significance].","pubmedId":"15181828"}
