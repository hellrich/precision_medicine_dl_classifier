There was no difference in tumor growth characteristics between CX3CR1(+/GFP) and C57Bl/6 mice. Five of 10 mice proceeded to extrascleral tumor growth and three of these developed metastases.\nIntraocularly injected HCmel12 cells developed tumor masses with histologic characteristics of aggressive melanoma similar to human uveal melanoma. Since hematogenous dissemination to the liver was not observed, intravitreally injected HCmel12 cells do not qualify as a model for metastasizing intraocular melanoma. However, since the eye represents a semi-closed compartment with access to constant blood supply, these intraocular tumors represent a model for studies of isolated parameters in general tumor biology of intraocular melanoma.","title":"Intravitreally Injected HCmel12 Melanoma Cells Serve as a Mouse Model of Tumor Biology of Intraocular Melanoma.","pubmedId":"25658144"}
