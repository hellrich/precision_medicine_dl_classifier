Local/distant control was assessed with attention to age, stage, lymph node involvement, histopathological differentiation and hormone receptor status.\nThirty-one male patients were irradiated postoperatively at the chest wall (mean dose 50 Gy) and 16 patients received radiation to regional lymph nodes. Tumour distribution by stage was: stage 0 (9.7%), stage I (22.6%), stage II (32.2%) and stage III (35.5%). Nine patients were subjected to additional hormone therapy and three patients to chemotherapy.\nLocal control was achieved in 30/31 (96.8%) patients. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS), disease specific (DSS) and disease free survival (DFS) at 5 years were 77% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.93), 84% (CI, 0.69-0.98) and 73% (CI, 0.57-0.91), respectively. Five-year DFS for stage 0 + I, II and III was 100, 56.3 and 67.3%, respectively. Favourable results were observed in patients with negative axillary nodes with 5-year OS/DFS of 90.9% (CI, 0.74-1.0). For lymph node positive patients DFS was 71% (CI, 0.4-1.0). Patients who presented lymph node metastases with extracapsular extension the 5-year OS was 80% (CI, 0.45-1.00), but the DFS was 0%. Stage of disease, lymph node involvement and histological differentiation were found to have statistically significant influence on DFS, but not on OS.\nApplication of postoperative radiotherapy approved in females resulted in one local relapse in our study population. Other treatment modalities (hormone therapy/chemotherapy) should continue to be considered a necessary treatment option for appropriately selected patients.","title":"Adjuvant radiotherapy in male breast cancer.","pubmedId":"10624850"}
