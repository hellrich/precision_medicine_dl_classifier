The following bone marrow evaluation showed aggregates of CD117 positive cells and a c-Kit point mutation at codon D 816V confirming the diagnosis of indolent mastocytosis.The present case confirm that FUO can be caused by an otherwise asymptomatic indolent mastocytosis, thus suggesting to include the serum-tryptase level measurement in the diagnostic approach to this pathological condition, at least in selected cases.","title":"Fever of unknown origin as unique symptom of an indolent mastocytosis.","pubmedId":"23092007"}
