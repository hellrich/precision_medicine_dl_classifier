While the greatest incidence of PTC is in women of childbearing age, the occurrence of PTC in men and postmenopausal women is associated with increased aggressiveness and poorer clinical outcomes. This gender disparity suggests that while the initiation of PTC is driven by estrogens, its progression may be mediated by androgens. Immunohistochemical analysis of PTC specimens from 5 male and 15 female patients indicated that all expressed androgen receptors (AR). AR mRNA was detected in equivalent amounts in three thyroid cell lines, but the PTC cell lines, BCPAP and TPC-1 expressed significantly more AR protein (4.6 fold and 3.9 fold, respectively) than the normal T-antigen transformed thyrocyte cell line, Nthy-ori-1. The treatment of the cell lines with the synthetic androgen, R1881 (10nM) resulted in increased phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in all three cell lines. Nthy expressed 2 fold more pERK when treated with R1881 whereas pAKT, which was previously undetected increased to significantly higher levels. R1881 addition increased pERK and pAKT 3 fold and 2 fold, respectively, in the male, RET/PTC cell line, TPC-1. pERK and pAKT were undetectable in the female, BRAFV600E cell line and were significantly induced by R1881.The known role of ERK and AKT in cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, and the activation of these molecules by androgens, may provide the mechanistic basis for the gender disparity in PTC aggressiveness and clinical outcome between young women and men/postmenopausal women.","title":"Androgens stimulate phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in thyroid cancer cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-3921"}
