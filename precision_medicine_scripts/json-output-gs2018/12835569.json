Most examples are of B cell origin, and CD30+ T cell PTLD are very rare. We report a CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in the skin of the right lower leg and in draining lymph nodes of the right inguinal region in an immunosuppressed 59-year-old male who had received a renal graft 9 years previously. Unlike the vast majority of PTLD, an incomplete T cell immunophenotype was observed, and there was evidence of T cell lineage at the genetic level reflected by a rearranged T cell receptor gamma gene. The neoplastic cells were non-reactive to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 1 protein. In addition, Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 8 sequences were absent. Arguments against a primary cutaneous ALCL, which is also ALK-1 negative, include systemic presentation at the time of initial diagnosis and immunoreactivity of the neoplastic cells to epithelial membrane antigen. Typically, our rare example of a posttransplantation systemic ALCL showed an aggressive behaviour and a poor response to both chemotherapy and local irradiation.","title":"Posttransplant CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma with skin and lymph node involvement.","pubmedId":"12835569"}
