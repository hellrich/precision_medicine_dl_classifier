Ultrasonography showed a small bladder tumor and right renal mass. Cystoscopy revealed a solitary, non papillary tumor at the right side of the retro-trigone. Computed tomography revealed a large tumor at the right kidney. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed. The histopathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma. There was no other distant metastasis. Sequentially, radical nephrectomy was performed. Histopathologically, the right renal tumor showed clear cell carcinoma. This was considered to be a case of a solitary metastatic bladder tumor from renal cell carcinoma.","title":"[Solitary metastasis to the urinary bladder from renal cell carcinoma: a case report].","pubmedId":"17252977"}
