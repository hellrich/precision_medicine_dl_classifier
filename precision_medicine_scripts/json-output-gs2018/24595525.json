Checkpoint kinase 2, encoded by the CHEK2 gene, is important in transducing the DNA damage response. Germ line CHEK2 mutations are seen in a subset of patients with a familial breast cancer and sarcoma phenotype. We report a case of retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma in a 61-year-old female with germ line CHEK2 mutation. MDM2 gene amplification normally present and used to aid in the diagnosis of retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma was absent in this case. Lack of MDM2 overexpression has similarly been reported in liposarcomas arising in patients with germ line TP53 mutations. We propose this case may highlight a nonamplified MDM2 phenotype in well- and dedifferentiated liposarcomas arising in patients with germ line mutations of genes involved in p53-associated DNA damage response pathways.","title":"Retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma lacking MDM2 amplification in a patient with a germ line CHEK2 mutation.","pubmedId":"24595525"}
