An estimated 100 million women worldwide have undergone this procedure, most commonly performed between the ages of 4 and 10 years old by a traditional birth attendant.  In one study, acute complications occurred in 39% of procedures.  Hemorrhage and infection leading to gangrene, septicemia, or tetanus are the main causes of mortality.  Late complications are estimated to occur in 37% of women.  Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease and dysmenorrhea occur in 14-65%.  Persistence of female genital mutilation is based, in part, on cultural beliefs about women, a perceived need to reduce sexual desire, and assurance of virginity and marriageability.  Women who do not comply face social ostracism.  In 1982, the World Health Organization recommended that female genital mutilation should not be carried out by any health professional under any circumstances.  Although legislation outlawing the practice is important, it may be unenforceable in many areas.  Key to the eradication of this practice are attitudinal changes through the education of both men and women and improvements in women\u0027s status.","title":"Female genital mutilation.","pubmedId":"9310217"}
