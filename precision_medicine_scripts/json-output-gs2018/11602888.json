We reviewed 40 consecutive cases of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas referred to a single center.\nFrom 1992 until 2000, 40 patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas were evaluated. The charts of all patients were reviewed to evaluate predictors of survival. Survival was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nForty patients were referred for management of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Tumors were located in the distal common duct in 3 (7.5%), mid duct in 5 (12.5%), and at the bifurcation in 32 (80%). Surgical resection was attempted in 32 (80%) patients and was curative in 9 (22.5%), palliative in 11 (27.5%), and diagnostic in 12 (30%). Mean survival for all patients was 21.1 +/- 5.1 months and on the basis of tumor stage was 71.4 +/- 15.4, 39.7 +/- 10.6, 19.2 +/- 2.9, 3.9 +/- 1.8, and 6.9 +/- 1.3 months for stages I, II, III, IVA, and IVB, respectively. Mean survival was 51.1 +/- 13.5 months versus 10 +/- 1.8 months in those with curative and noncurative resections, respectively. The presence of a portal mass was associated with a reduction in mean survival from 28.4 +/- 7.2 months to 6.0 +/- 1.9 months.\nExtrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma remains a dismal disease with only a 22.5% chance of a curative surgical resection, achieving a 5-year survival rate of 44.4%. Only the absence of a portal mass was predictive of a possible curative resection and long-term survival.","title":"A single center experience with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"11602888"}
