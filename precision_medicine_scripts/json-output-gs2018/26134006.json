Single or multiple mutations were identified by the numbers of peak. FLT3-ITD mutation burden was calculated by the peak area of mutant divided by the wild-type and mutant peak areas. Clinical data was collected and followed up in the FLT3-ITD mutation patients.\nMultiple ITD mutations were common in patients aged 60 and above. Patients with single ITD mutation had higher percentage of blasts in bone marrow than multiple ITD mutations (0.758 vs 0.638, P\u003d0.028). The numbers and length of FLT3-ITD mutation had no impact on prognosis. Patients with less than 10% of ITD mutation burden showed no difference with the intermediate-risk c-kit group in OS and CRD, but the two groups had longer OS and CRD than ITD mutation burden above 10% (OS: undefined, undefined, 9.9 months, P\u003c0.05; CRD: undefined, undefined, 6.7 months, P\u003c0.05). In patients with ITD mutation burden above 10%, cases with NPM1 or CEBPA mutation alone had markedly longer CRD than ITD mutation alone (25.0 vs 5.1 months, P\u003d0.003), while OS were similar (11.4 vs 8.0 months, P\u003e0.05).\nNon-M3 AML patients with less than 10% FLT3-ITD mutation burden had a better prognosis than those above 10%.","title":"[ITD mutation burden for the prognosis in FLT3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia patients].","pubmedId":"26134006"}
