We studied 24 anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) classified by World Health Organization criteria [17 primary nodal/systemic (10 ALK+, 7 ALK-), seven primary cutaneous], and 17 additional non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphomas [one ALK+ B-lineage lymphoma, 14 ALK- diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (seven anaplastic variants, five nonanaplastic, two secondary CD30+), two follicular lymphomas]. ALK- lymphomas with anaplastic morphology showed extra nonrearranged anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene loci (P\u003d0.004) due to trisomy 2 irrespective of the following factors: B or T/null phenotype (P\u003d0.315), diagnostic categories of systemic or cutaneous ALCL or the above-mentioned B-cell lymphomas (P\u003d0.131), and CD30 positivity by immunohistochemistry (P\u003d1.000). Trisomy 2 was absent in all ALK+ lymphomas (P\u003d0.009), which showed rearranged ALK gene loci (P\u003c0.001). Whether trisomy 2 is a primary or secondary event that leads to ALK- lymphomas cannot be determined from this study. Its presence in secondary B-cell lymphomas suggests that trisomy 2 may be a secondary cytogenetic aberration in lymphomas in general. Further investigation of this finding is necessary to further our understanding of the heterogeneous group of ALK- lymphomas.","title":"Extra copies of chromosome 2 are a recurring aberration in ALK-negative lymphomas with anaplastic morphology.","pubmedId":"15475930"}
