These tumors currently account for approximately 15% of all childhood cancer related deaths in spite of intensive multimodal chemotherapy and are a major problem in pediatric oncology. The identification of novel therapeutic targets is urgently required to reduce patient morbidity.\nThe purpose of this article is to review and synthesize all of the rapidly expanding evidence for the contribution of microRNAs (miRNAs) in neuroblastoma aggressive disease pathogenesis, along with the prospect of using small RNAs as therapeutics.\nThe reader will obtain insight on the miRNAs that are dysregulated in neuroblastoma along with potential therapeutic strategies and the most promising targets.\nA number of miRNAs which are associated with aggressive disease pathogenesis in neuroblastoma patients have been demonstrated to contribute in major ways to cell proliferation rates, apoptosis, differentiation, invasiveness and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Directly or indirectly interfering with the function of these miRNAs may prove to be an important and novel form of therapy.","title":"Therapeutic targeting of miRNAs in neuroblastoma.","pubmedId":"20658962"}
