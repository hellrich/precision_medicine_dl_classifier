There is no standard of care for this population, which is under-represented in clinical trials. How are non-metastatic patients 75 and over treated in routine practice?   Methods:   Our study is a retrospective analysis based on 107 patients aged 75 and over (median 81.4 [75-94]) with non-metastatic squamous cell head and neck carcinomas treated in Bordeaux Academic Hospital between March 2007 and March 2012. We compared, for each patient, the standard treatment proposed to younger patients as described by international recommendations (NCCN, ESMO), the treatment recommended in multidisciplinary staff, and the treatment ultimately received.   Results:   Of the 107 patients, 69 (64.5%) were males and 38 (35.5%) females. 51.4% had an oral cavity cancer, 16.8% oropharyngeal, 15.9% laryngeal, 13.1% hypopharyngeal and 2.8% prevalent cervical lymph node without primary tumor.  The standard treatment was proposed by multidisciplinary staff in less than 40% of patients, because of their deteriorating performance status (PS), chronological age and/or comorbidities. The treatment recommendedby multidisciplinary staff (with patients present in  of the cases) was ultimately received in more than 80% of cases. In the others, the proposed treatment was not administered because of patients deteriorating PS or their refusal. Only 15 patients had a geriatric assessment and none of them received the standard treatment. Treatment toxicities were acceptable and similar to those found in literature for younger patients.  At 5 years, overall survival of our population was 14.5%, but specific survival was 74,5%. Our population passed away more from comorbidities than from their cancer after the first 2 annual follow-ups.  Conclusions:   We recommend the systematic completion, before treatment proposal, of at least one easy screening of geriatric fragilities in order not to under or over-treat these patients, and a prompt start of treatment after decision by multidisciplinary staff because of quick deterioration of PS. We also recommend that elderly patients can be included in clinical trials.","title":"Does age impact treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas?
