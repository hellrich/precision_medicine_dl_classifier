We explored combination effects of these agents in the HER-2-overexpressing BT474 breast cancer cell line. Trastuzumab and 2C4 synergistically inhibited the survival of BT474 cells, in part, because of increased apoptosis. Trastuzumab increased 2C4-mediated disruption of HER-2 dimerization with the epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-3. Combination drug treatment reduced levels of total and phosphorylated HER-2 protein and blocked receptor signaling through Akt but did not affect mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results suggest that combining HER-2-targeting agents may be a more effective therapeutic strategy in breast cancer rather than treating with a single HER-2 monoclonal antibody.","title":"The HER-2-targeting antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab synergistically inhibit the survival of breast cancer cells.","pubmedId":"15059883"}
