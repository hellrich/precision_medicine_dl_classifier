The GSNp85 truncate was not expressed in radial growth phase melanomas (Clark level I), acquired naevi, other skin cancers or normal skin tissues. Peptide-sequencing analysis revealed that GSNp85 lacks the C-terminal domain of wild-type gelsolin at the region containing the caspase-8 recognition site IETD. Caspase-8 processing was detected in GSNp85-positive but not GSNp85-negative melanomas. These data suggest that GSNp85 is a cleavage product of caspase-8 and may be useful as a new marker for the vertical or metastatic growth phase of malignant melanoma.","title":"Identification of a novel gelsolin truncate in the vertical and metastatic phase malignant melanomas.","pubmedId":"12459641"}
