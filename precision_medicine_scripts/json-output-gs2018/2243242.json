Fifty nine individual cases were stained at different in vitro ages for glial fibrillary acidic protein, fibronectin, galactocerebroside, HNK-1/Leu 7, A2B5, vimentin, factor VIII and A4. Histologically, the cases were composed of eight low-grade astrocytomas, 11 high-grade astrocytomas, four low-grade oligodendrogliomas, seven high-grade oligodendrogliomas and 29 glioblastomas. The 45 cases were analysed within the first 3 weeks of culture, many of them as primary cultures. In 11 cases stainings were performed repeatedly at intervals of up to 6 months. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining was positive in most of the early cultures of astrocytomas (low and high grade) and glioblastomas; expression in more than 50% of the cells was found in 1 of 5 low-grade astrocytomas, 5 of 11 high-grade astrocytomas and 14 of 29 glioblastomas. Two of the high-grade astrocytomas were stained once more after 6 weeks in culture and were found to be only 1% positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein but strongly positive for fibronectin. The same was true for five of the glioblastoma cases. Two of these cases remained glial fibrillary acid protein positive and developed into stable permanent cell lines. Only one case started with 1% of glial fibrillary acidic protein positive cells and later developed into a 99% glial fibrillary acidic protein positive cell line. Neither HNK-1/Leu 7 expression nor A2B5 staining appeared to have a relationship to the glial fibrillary acidic protein staining. It was observed that glial fibrillary acidic protein and HNK-1/Leu 7 were both 100% in some cases but that later one of the two antigens disappeared but not the other. The amount of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining does not allow the prediction of A2B5 staining. The study shows that initiation of primary cultures on an extracellular matrix yields more glial fibrillary acidic protein positive cells in primary cultures than have been found in other studies. It is concluded that only a rigid standardization of culture conditions will ensure the validity of comparisons of in vitro data obtained in primary cultures.","title":"Antigenic staining patterns of human glioma cultures: primary cultures, long-term cultures and cell lines.","pubmedId":"2243242"}
