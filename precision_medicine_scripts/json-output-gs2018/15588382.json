Inherited forms of MTC are related to mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. We screened genomic DNA from 11 patients with MTC for mutations in exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the RET proto-oncogene. Subsequently, we also evaluated a family of 1 patient with presumed diagnosis of sporadic MTC. Three patients with MEN2A from two unrelated families presented mutations in exon 11 (C634Y and C634R). A heterozygous mutation in exon 14 (V804M) was identified in the patient with the presumed sporadic MTC. We also observed two different polymorphisms: S904S in exon 15 (2 patients) and L769L in exon 13 (4 patients). The L769L polymorphism has been associated with earlier onset of sporadic MTC. On the other hand, mutations in exon 14 are associated with MTC of later onset and lower aggressiveness. Indeed, the carrier of the V804M mutation associated with L769L polymorphism presented MTC at 32 years of age, in contrast to her asymptomatic mother, who had only the V804M mutation and had MTC diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy at 60 years of age. In conclusion, the present study confirms the need for genetic screening to differentiate sporadic and hereditary forms of MTC. In addition, the genetic study allows the identification of asymptomatic carriers of hereditary forms of MTC. Finally, we speculated that the L769L polymorphism of the RET proto-oncogene may be related to earlier age of onset in the patient with the V804M mutation.","title":"Polymorphisms in the RET proto-oncogene and the phenotypic presentation of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"15588382"}
