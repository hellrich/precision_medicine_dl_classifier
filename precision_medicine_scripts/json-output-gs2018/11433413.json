The majority of these neoplasms occur in the cerebellum and are classified as medulloblastomas (MB). Most PNETs develop sporadically; however, their incidence is highly elevated in patients carrying germline APC gene mutations. The APC gene encodes a central component of the WNT/wingless developmental signaling pathway. It regulates the levels of cytoplasmic beta-catenin protein that plays a central role in neural development and cell proliferation. We analyzed 87 sporadic PNETs and 10 PNET cell lines for mutations of the APC gene and beta-catenin (CTNNB1) gene using single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing analysis. We examined the mutation cluster region of APC (codons 1255--1641) for germline variants and somatic mutations. The medulloblastoma cell line MHH-MED-2 carried a Glu1317Gln missense germline variant and a sporadic MB sample showed a somatic Pro1319Leu substitution. Mutational analysis of exon 3 of CTNNB1 uncovered 4 PNETs (4.8%) with somatic missense mutations. These mutations caused amino acid substitutions in 3 of 80 medulloblastomas (Ser33Phe, Ser33Cys and Ser37Cys) and 1 of 4 supratentorial PNETs (Gly34Val). All mutations affected GSK-3 beta phosphorylation sites of the degradation targeting box of beta-catenin and resulted in nuclear beta-catenin protein accumulation. Deletions of CTNNB1 were not detected by PCR amplification with primers spanning exons 1--5. Our data indicate that inappropriate activation of the WNT/wingless signaling pathway by mutations of its components may contribute to the pathogenesis of a subset of PNETs.","title":"Somatic mutations of WNT/wingless signaling pathway components in primitive neuroectodermal tumors.","pubmedId":"11433413"}
