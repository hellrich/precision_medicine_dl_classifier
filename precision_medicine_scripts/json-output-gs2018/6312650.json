Of 97 cases of undifferentiated carcinomas of nasopharyngeal type, 63 were composed of solid cords of epithelial cells (RÃ©gaud type), 22 showed isolated cells in a lymphoid stroma (Schmincke type), and in 12 the neoplastic cells were aligned with a fibrosarcoma-like aspect (spindle-cell type). The 36 cases of squamous cell carcinoma showed various degrees of differentiation. Of the remaining 7 cases, 3 were transitional cell carcinomas, 1 was an adenoid cystic carcinoma, and 3 were unclassifiable carcinomas. The undifferentiated carcinoma was present in all ages, with a male : female rate of 1.27 : 1. The squamous cell carcinomas were prevalent in males (3.5 : 1) and older patients. The 10-year survival rate was 30% in the group of patients with undifferentiated carcinoma, whereas patients with squamous cell carcinoma died within 4 years of the diagnosis.","title":"Morphologic and classificatory considerations about 140 cases of carcinoma of the nasopharynx.","pubmedId":"6312650"}
