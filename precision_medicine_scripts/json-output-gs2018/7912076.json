Here we show that the expression of the suppressor gene p53 protein correlates with mts1 expression. In murine melanoma B16-F1 cells, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone up-regulated mts1 and increased p53 positivity in immunohistochemical tests. In B16-ML8 cells, retinoic acid reduced mts1 expression together with a reduction of p53 positivity. The variation of p53 in association with mts1 gene expression suggests that the mts1 product might interact with and stabilize p53. Taxol-induced aneuploidy increased the proportion of G0G1 phase cells, increased p53 positivity, and down-regulated mts1. This suggests that mts1 transcription may have been negatively regulated, possibly on account of the stabilization of microtubules by taxol. We postulate that the control of G1-S transition by p53 could be due to p53 sequestration by mts1, leading to microtubule depolymerization and signaling entry, into the S phase. Thus, a coordinated function of mts1 and p53 may be involved not only in uncontrolled growth but also in cytoskeletal depolymerization that could lead to cancer invasion.","title":"Metastasis-associated mts1 gene expression correlates with increased p53 detection in the B16 murine melanoma.","pubmedId":"7912076"}
