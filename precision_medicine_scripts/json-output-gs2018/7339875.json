Clinically these lesions had a benign appearance, similar to a foreign body granuloma and an intradermal naevus, respectively, but histological examination showed a picture typical of basal cell carcinoma. The tumours were radically treated and no recurrence occurred during an observation time of 12 and 42 months, respectively.","title":"Basal cell carcinoma in children.
