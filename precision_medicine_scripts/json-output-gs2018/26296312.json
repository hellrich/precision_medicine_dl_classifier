In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of miR-454 was up-regulated in uveal melanoma tissues compared to normal tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-454 resulted in significant promotion of cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion and induction of cell cycle in uveal melanoma cells. Furthermore, we identified PTEN as a direct target of miR-454. Our data revealed that ectopic expression of PTEN restored the effects of miR-454 on cell proliferation and invasion in uveal melanoma cells. These findings support an oncogene role of miR-454 in development of uveal melanoma. ","title":"MicroRNA-454 functions as an oncogene by regulating PTEN in uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"26296312"}
