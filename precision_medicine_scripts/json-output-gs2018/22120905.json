It is caused by germline mutations in the gene encoding the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor. Somatic APC inactivation due to mutation or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) promotes the development of adenomatous polyps by stabilizing the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin. Although colorectal cancer is by far the most common malignancy seen in FAP patients, the widespread use of prophylactic colectomy in these patients has increased the clinical importance of extracolonic tumors that are part of the neoplastic spectrum in FAP. Many of these tumors exhibit LOH or somatic APC mutation, strongly supporting a causative role of APC inactivation in their pathogenesis. Here we describe a 47-year-old female FAP patient with clinical manifestations of virilization who was found to have an ovarian steroid cell tumor, a rare neoplasm not known to be associated with FAP. Immunohistochemical analysis of the ovarian tumor demonstrated strong nuclear β-catenin staining consistent with somatic APC inactivation, and molecular analysis confirmed biallelic APC inactivation in the tumor. Our findings provide the first evidence that ovarian steroid cell tumors may be an extracolonic manifestation of FAP and implicate β-catenin activation as an oncogenic mechanism in ovarian steroid cell tumorigenesis.","title":"Ovarian steroid cell tumor with biallelic adenomatous polyposis coli inactivation in a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis.","pubmedId":"22120905"}
