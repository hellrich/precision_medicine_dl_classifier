As a result of highly collaborative clinical research by pediatric cooperative cancer groups worldwide, disease-free survival has improved significantly during the past 3 decades. Further improvements in outcomes of children who have AML probably will reflect continued progress in understanding the biology of AML and the concomitant development of new molecularly targeted agents for use in combination with conventional chemotherapy drugs.","title":"Acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"18242314"}
