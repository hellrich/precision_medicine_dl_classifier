The ITD mutation in FLT3 exon 14, 15 of bone marrow mononuclear cells was detected by genomic DNA-PCR, the TKD point mutation in FLT3 exon 20 was detected by genomic DNA-PCR combined with restriction endonuclease digest. The results indicated that among 131 newly diagnosed AML patients, 21 patients (16.0%) showed FLT3-ITD positive, 3 patients (2.3%) showed FLT3-TKD positive. None was found harboring both mutations. The WBC and bone marrow blast counts in FLT3-ITD positive patients seemed both higher than those in patients with wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-wt), but there was significant difference only in WBC count (p\u003c0.05). The complete remission (CR) rate in FLT3-ITD positive patients was 47.6%, which was significantly lower than that in FLT3-wt patients (88.1%, p\u003c0.05). There was no statistical difference in CR rate between FLT3-ITD positive and negative patients in 20 cases of M3; the CR rate in FLT3-ITD positive patients with non M(3) was 37.5 (6/16) which was obviously lower than that in FLT3-wt patients with non M3 (90.6%, 48/53) (p\u003c0.05). 3 FLT3-ITD positive patients with CR relapsed after CR for 14 (2-20) months with relapse rate 50% (3/6) which was higher than that in FLT3-wt patients (29.2%, 14/48). It is concluded that FLT3 mutation is common in AML patients, while FLT3-ITD mutation is more frequent than FLT3-TKD mutation. The AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation have a poor prognosis, while FLT3-TKD point mutation does not significantly influences prognosis of the patients. Therefore early detection of FLT3 mutation may be important for targeting therapy and evaluating clinical prognosis of AML patients.","title":"[FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene mutations in acute myeloid leukemia].","pubmedId":"19840437"}
