Both small cells arranged in a cribriform (cylindromatous) pattern and moderately dysplastic squamous cells (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) were evident.\nAlthough the endocervical brush technique may yield well-preserved cells and tissue fragments morphologically characteristic of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the cervix, confusion with more common tumors, such as endometrial adenocarcinoma, still may create cytologic diagnostic difficulties.","title":"Cytologic features of primary adenoid cystic carcinoma of the uterine cervix.
