Specimens were then reexamined using analysis of p53, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), MIB-1, and B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF) duplication.\nSix patients were studied. All were diagnosed with World Health Organization grade 1 ONGs on original pathology. On reexamination, BRAF tandem duplication was found in 2 patients with neurofibromatosis Type 1 association. P53 immunoreactivity was noted in a third case. No cases had IDH1 immunoreactivity. Focal elevations of MIB-1 up to 7.5% were noted in 2 cases.\nONGs are neoplasms with variable degrees of aggressiveness. As more is understood regarding their varied genetic underpinnings, improved pathologic classification and individualized treatment regimens may be achieved. The authors hope that this study helps guide the oculoplastic community toward a multi-institutional, prospective study of ONG genomic sequencing.","title":"Optic nerve glioma: case series with review of clinical, radiologic, molecular, and histopathologic characteristics.","pubmedId":"24762952"}
