Here, we provide genetic analysis of the immunologic consequences associated with the use of an agonistic CD40 mAb in a patient with metastatic melanoma who responded, underwent a single metastasectomy, and then achieved a complete remission ongoing for more than 9 years after starting therapy. Tumor microenvironment after immunotherapy was associated with proinflammatory modulations and emergence of a de novo T-cell repertoire as detected by next-generation sequencing of T-cell receptors (TCR) in the tumor and blood. The de novo T-cell repertoire identified in the posttreatment metastasectomy sample was also present-and in some cases expanded-in the circulation years after completion of therapy. Comprehensive study of this \"exceptional responder\" highlights the emerging potential of direct immune agonists in the next wave of cancer immunotherapies and a potential role for TCR deep sequencing in cancer immune assessment.","title":"Immune activation and a 9-year ongoing complete remission following CD40 antibody therapy and metastasectomy in a patient with metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"25252722"}
