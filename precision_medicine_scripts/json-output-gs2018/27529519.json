Favorable subtypes (t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16), and t(15;17)) decreased in general from the pediatric age group (2 to \u003c 18 years; 33%) to the oldest groups (\u003c5% for \u003e 70 years; P \u003c .0001). Unfavorable cytogenetics (-7/del(7), -5/del(5q) or 5p, inv(3)/t(3;3), t(6;9), complex karyotype, 12p, 17p, and 11q23/mixed-lineage leukemia aberrations, excluding t(9;11)) were frequent (42%) in infants (\u003c2 years), had a low frequency in children and young adults (\u003c22%), and increased in frequency up to 36% in patients older than 85 years (P \u003d .01). This was even more significant for complex karyotypes (P ≤ .0001), which also showed a strong increase in the absolute age-specific incidence with age. Interestingly, the frequency of 11q23 abnormalities decreased from infants to older patients. The proportion of clinically relevant molecular aberrations of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α, nucleophosmin (NPM1), and NPM1/fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication increased with age.\nAltogether, with the exclusion of infants, a significant decrease in the proportion of favorable cytogenetic subtypes and an increase in unfavorable cytogenetics were observed with increasing age. These findings indicate different mechanisms for the pathogenesis of AML; these different mechanisms also suggest directions for etiological research and contribute to the more unfavorable prognosis with increasing age.
