In this review we focus on recent leaps in our understanding of how Plk1 controls cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division. Furthermore, we will go beyond mitosis to highlight unexpected roles of Plk1 during interphase and during animal development. In vertebrate cells, Plk1 has emerged as a novel player in maintaining genomic stability during DNA replication and as an important modulator of the DNA damage checkpoint. Plk1 functions extend past the \u0027core\u0027 cell cycle. Plk1 acts as a link between developmental processes and the cell cycle machinery during asymmetric cell divisions in flies and worms. The term \u0027mitotic kinase\u0027 might not do justice to Plk1 in the light of these recent results.","title":"Polo-like kinase 1 reaches beyond mitosis--cytokinesis, DNA damage response, and development.","pubmedId":"19000759"}
