The rationale is that breast masses are often stiffer than healthy tissue; furthermore, malignant masses are stiffer than benign masses. The comb-push ultrasound shear elastography (CUSE) method is used to noninvasively assess a tissue\u0027s mechanical properties. CUSE utilizes a sequence of simultaneous multiple laterally spaced acoustic radiation force (ARF) excitations and detection to reconstruct the region of interest (ROI) shear wave speed map, from which a tissue stiffness property can be quantified. In this study, the tissue stiffnesses of 73 breast masses were interrogated. The mean shear wave speeds for benign masses (3.42 ± 1.32 m/s) were lower than malignant breast masses (6.04 ± 1.25 m/s). These speed values correspond to higher stiffness in malignant breast masses (114.9 ± 40.6 kPa) than benign masses (39.4 ± 28.1 kPa and p \u003c; 0.001), when tissue elasticity is quantified by Young\u0027s modulus. A Young\u0027s modulus \u003e83 kPa is established as a cut-off value for differentiating between malignant and benign suspicious breast masses, with a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 89.19% sensitivity, 88.69% specificity, and 0.911 for the area under the curve (AUC).","title":"Update on Breast Cancer Detection Using  Comb-Push Ultrasound Shear Elastography.","pubmedId":"26688871"}
