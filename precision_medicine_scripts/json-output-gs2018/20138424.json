Increased p-JNK expression was significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastases (P\u003d0.001) and advanced TNM stages (P\u003d0.02). Furthermore, p-JNK expression was positively correlated with osteopontin (OPN) expression (r\u003d0.58, P\u003c0.001). Activation of p-JNK may play a role in the carcinogenesis and lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, and may be a molecular target for therapeutic intervention.","title":"Phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase is overexpressed in human papillary thyroid carcinomas and associates with lymph node metastasis.","pubmedId":"20138424"}
