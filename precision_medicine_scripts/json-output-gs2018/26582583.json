EGFR however also exhibits dynamic changes of subcellular localization, leading to STAT5 complex formation, nuclear translocation and induction of Aurora-A expression in squamous cancer cells. We previously described high EGFR and Aurora-A expression in esophageal cancer cells. Here, we investigated subcellular localization of EGFR and STAT5 in esophageal cancer cells.\nQuantitative immunofluorescence analyses of four esophageal cancer cell lines reflecting esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC) revealed that the subcellular localization of EGFR was shifted from a membranous to cytoplasmic localization upon EGF-stimulation in OE21 (ESCC) cells. Thereby, EGFR in part co-localized with E-Cadherin. In parallel, phosphorylated STAT5-Tyr694 appeared to increase in the nucleus and to decrease at the cell membrane. In three additional cell lines, EGFR was only marginally (Kyse-410/ESCC; OE19/EAC) and weakly (OE33, EAC) detectable at the cell membrane. Partial co-localization of EGFR and E-Cadherin occurred in OE33 cells. Post EGF-stimulation, EGFR was detected in the cytoplasm, resembling endosomal compartments. Furthermore, OE19 and OE33 exhibited nuclear STAT5-Tyr694 phosphorylation upon EGF-stimulation. None of the four cell lines showed nuclear EGFR expression and localization.\nIn contrast to other (squamous) cancer cells, activation of EGFR in esophageal squamous cancer cells does not result in nuclear translocation of EGFR. Still, the subcellular localization of EGFR may influence STAT5-associated signaling pathways in esophageal cancer cells and hence possibly also the responses to ErbB, respective EGFR-targeted therapies.","title":"Subcellular localization of EGFR in esophageal carcinoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"26582583"}
