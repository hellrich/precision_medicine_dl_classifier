A 68-year-old male presented with acute lower abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a 4.5-cm infrarenal AAA, a 6.0-cm left rCIAA with retroperitoneal hematoma and a 13-cm mass in the liver, which was suspected to be HCC. His laboratory data showed severe liver dysfunction. An emergency EVAR was done under local anesthesia because of his liver dysfunction. He was transferred to another hospital without any complications.
