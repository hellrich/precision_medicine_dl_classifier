But in contrast to other cancers, effect of obesity on occurrence, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of these tumors remains to date unknown. This is a retrospective review of 111 obese patients (sex ratio\u003d6.4, median age\u003d54.5 year old), treated between 1999 and 2007. Risk factors, tumoral localization and staging (41% stage I-II) were the same as in general population. However, we found 26.1% difficult pan-endoscopies, 54% ACE-27 comorbidity scores â‰¥2 and 22.5% misstaged cervical lymphadenopathy. Treatment was based upon surgery (61%) or radiotherapy-chemotherapy (39%), and 37% of patients developed complications. Median follow up (38 months) and five-year overall survival (50%) are comparable to data in non obese patients. Although no direct relation between obesity and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck was found, obesity causes problems in tumor assessment and increases surgical complications rate. However, final good therapeutic tolerance and overall survival rate show that these patients should be managed like normal weighted ones. Receiving optimal treatments allow them to anticipate equivalent outcome as in general population.","title":"Management and outcome of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas in obese patients.","pubmedId":"21641852"}
