We reviewed their original endoscopic findings to determine the clinical and endoscopic factors that might predict a greater risk for future cancers.\nPatients aged â‰¥ 60 years had a higher risk of an interval neoplasm (P \u003c .0001). Interval cancers were more common on the right side of the colon and in the hepatic flexure (both P \u003c .0001). We did not observe an increased rate of interval cancers in patients with poor preparation (P \u003d .799); however, examination completion rates did affect the rate of interval cancers (P \u003d .016).\nBetter identification of higher risk patients and assurance of follow-up examinations might increase the percentage of colon cancers discovered at an early stage. Special attention to careful examination of the right colon is key.","title":"Interval colorectal cancer after colonoscopy.","pubmedId":"25510180"}
