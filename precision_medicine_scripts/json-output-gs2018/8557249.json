Mutations of the RET proto-oncogene are associated with all three diseases. To obtain an insight into the molecular heterogeneity of MEN 2 syndromes and FMTC in the Netherlands, probands of 20 MEN 2A families, two FMTC families, and seven MEN 2B families were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing, and restriction enzyme digestion for abnormalities in the RET proto-oncogene. RET mutations were found in all cases. All MEN 2A families had a mutation involving one of five cysteine codons in exons 10 and 11 of RET. Two novel dinucleotide mutations and a de novo mutation were found. Both FMTC families had a mutation of the Cys at codon 618. All MEN 2B probands carried a Met to Thr mutation in exon 16. All mutations could be confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of PCR amplicons. Identification of the RET mutation in the Dutch population with hereditary C-cell carcinoma facilitates genetic testing for families or individuals at risk for MEN 2A, FMTC, and MEN 2B.","title":"Mutation analysis of the RET proto-oncogene in Dutch families with MEN 2A, MEN 2B and FMTC: two novel mutations and one de novo mutation for MEN 2A.","pubmedId":"8557249"}
