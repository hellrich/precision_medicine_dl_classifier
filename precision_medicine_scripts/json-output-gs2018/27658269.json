It is not clear whether the splice variant BCR-ABL1(35INS) is also associated with treatment failure.\nWe reviewed all CML patients who had BCR-ABL1 kinase mutation analysis performed between August 1, 2007, and January 15, 2014. Patients who had BCR-ABL1(35INS) detected had their medical records reviewed to determine response to TKI therapy.\nTwo hundred and eighty four patients had kinase mutation testing performed; of these, 64 patients (23%) had BCR-ABL1(35INS) detected. Forty-five patients were in chronic phase (70%), 10 were in accelerated phase (16%), 6 were in blastic phase (9%), and 3 were in other settings (5%). Of the 34 chronic phase patients who began therapy with imatinib, 23 patients (68%) failed therapy: 8 patients (24%) had primary refractory disease, 11 patients (32%) progressed, and 4 patients (12%) had disease progression after dose interruption. In contrast to the patients with disease progression or lack of response, none of 23 patients who were responding to imatinib had BCR-ABL1(35INS) detected. DNA sequencing of commonly mutated spliceosomal genes SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, SFA31, PRPF408, U2A565, and SF1 did not reveal mutations in seven BCR-ABL1(35INS) -positive patients tested.\nThe splice variant BCR-ABL1(35INS) is frequently found in patients who are resistant to imatinib. Mutations in the commonly mutated spliceosomal proteins do not contribute to this association.","title":"Resistance to imatinib in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and the splice variant BCR-ABL1(35INS).","pubmedId":"27658269"}
