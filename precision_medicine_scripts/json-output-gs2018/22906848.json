We determined the incidence and prognostic relevance of NPM1 mutations, their association with FLT3 and IDH mutations, and other clinical characteristics in Serbian adult AML patients. Samples from 111 adult de novo AML patients, including 73 AML cases with a normal karyotype (NK-AML), were studied. NPM1, FLT3, and IDH mutations were detected by PCR and direct sequencing. NPM1 mutations were detected in 22.5% of patients. The presence of NPM1 mutations predicted a low CR rate and shorter OS. NPM1 mutations showed an association with both FLT3 and IDH mutations. Survival analysis based on NPM1/FLT3 mutational status revealed a lower OS for NPM1(+)/FLT3(-) compared to the NPM1(-)/FLT3(-) group in NK-AML patients. The lack of impact or unfavorable prognostic effect of NPM1 mutations found in this study can be assigned to a small cohort of analyzed AML patients, as can the presence of FLT3 and IDH mutations or other genetic lesions that cooperate with NPM1 mutations influencing prognosis.","title":"Prognostic impact of NPM1 mutations in Serbian adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"22906848"}
