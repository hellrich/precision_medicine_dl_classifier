Triple negative breast cancer is characterized by lack of expression of Î±-estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. Vast majority of these cases are low-differentiated carcinomas, majority belonging to the basal-like subgroup defined originally by DNA chips. Clinically, they are characterized by greater aggressiveness, frequent rate of local recurrence and organ metastases. They are more common in younger women and are associated with the occurrence of hereditary forms of breast cancer caused by pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 gene and in rare cases also BRCA2.\nThe objective of this review is to provide comprehensive information about current knowledge of triple negative breast cancer. This paper summarizes information about epidemiology and etiopathogenesis of this disease, describes risk factors for both sporadic and hereditary forms of triple negative breast cancer, addresses histopathologic and molecular classification of triple negative breast cancer, and these characteristics associates with treatment and prediction of disease development. The article also addresses new anticancer drugs tested for triple negative breast cancer.\nTriple negative breast cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases with limited therapeutic options. The key to further shift in therapy is detailed knowledge of its clinical and molecular diversity and identification of predictive biomarkers. Further improvement of therapy results of triple negative breast cancer cannot be expected before targeted therapy of this disease is found.","title":"[Triple Negative Breast Cancer].","pubmedId":"26673990"}
