Case 1 is an 87-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital because of nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic examination revealed an ulcerated tumor of the distal esophagus, and a biopsy was taken. The biopsy showed malignant polygonal and spindle cells. No melanin pigment was recognized. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for melanosome (HMB45), S100 protein, KIT and Platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA). The patient was treated by chemotherapy and radiation, but died of systemic metastasis 12 mo after the presentation. Case 2 is a 56-year-old man presenting with dysphagia. Endoscopic examination revealed a polypoid tumor in the middle esophagus, and a biopsy was obtained. The biopsy showed malignant spindle cells without melanin pigment. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positively labeled for melanosome, S100 protein, KIT and PDGFRA. The patient refused operation, and was treated by palliative chemotherapy and radiation. He died of metastasis 7 mo after the admission. In both cases, molecular genetic analyses of KIT gene (exons 9, 11, 13 and 17) and PDGFRA gene (exons 12 and 18) were performed by the PCR direct sequencing method, which showed no mutations of KIT and PDGFRA genes. This is the first report of esophageal malignant melanoma with an examination of the expression of KIT and PDGFRA and the mutational status of KIT and PDGFRA genes.","title":"Amelanotic malignant melanoma of the esophagus: report of two cases with immunohistochemical and molecular genetic study of KIT and PDGFRA.","pubmedId":"19496203"}
