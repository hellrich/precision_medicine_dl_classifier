Recent evidence has indicated that the human homologue of a Drosophila segment polarity gene, PTCH, is a NBCCS susceptibility gene. In the study presented here, we detected two novel mutations of the PTCH gene, I805X/2395delC and Y93X/C297A, in two unrelated Japanese patients. Early protection of the skin from the sunlight is important to the prevention of BCC development in NBCCS patients. Genetic analysis of the PTCH gene is essential for the early, definitive diagnosis of NBCCS, especially before the expression of clinical manifestations is complete.","title":"Germline mutations of the PTCH gene in Japanese patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.","pubmedId":"11457640"}
