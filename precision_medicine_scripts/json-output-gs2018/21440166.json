We report a patient with presumed stage IV lung cancer and a parietal meningioma. The patient underwent meningioma resection and a salvage operation for lung cancer. Palliative chemotherapy resulted in a partial response of the main tumor. Pathologic examination confirmed the rare coexistence of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma and benign metastatic meningiomas. Although distant metastases from meningiomas are infrequent clinically, the possibility of pulmonary involvement should not be ignored in patients with aberrant responses of separate lesions after chemotherapy.","title":"Coexistence of intracranial meningioma, pulmonary meningiomas, and lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21440166"}
