H19 is expressed in both embryonic cells and tumor cells, but its physical and pathological functions still need to be further studied. Our results showed that microRNA-675, a microRNA in the first exon of H19, expressed in glioma. Over-expression of microRNA-675 in a range of glioma cell lines resulted in their immoderate proliferation and migration. In addition, H19 derived microRNA-675 was down-regulated in the glioma, and CDK6, a pivotal regulator in cell cycle, was a target of microRNA-675. The survival of glioma patients with low CDK6 expression significantly increased as compared to patients with high CDK6 expression. Moreover, the CDK6 expression was inversely correlated with microRNA-675 expression in the glioma. Our results suggest that H19 derived microRNA-675 may regulate giloma cell proliferation and migration through CDK6, and predict a poor prognosis of glioma patients.
