Patients who were considered incurable and patients with recurrent disease were excluded. CT scans of the chest and abdomen were performed.\nWe examined 100 patients. Two patients had pulmonary metastases at presentation. An occult aortic aneurysm required surgical repair before anticancer therapy in one patient. In many patients, nonspecific CT findings warranted further examinations or close follow-up. The abdominal CT was negative for metastatic HNSCC in all patients.\nRoutine CT screening of the chest and abdomen resulted in upstaging of disease in two patients (2%) and altered the treatment approach in three patients (3%). Abdominal CT does not seem beneficial in patients with previously untreated HNSCC. Chest CT is not indicated routinely.","title":"CT of the chest and abdomen in patients with newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16114003"}
