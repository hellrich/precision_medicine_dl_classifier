We studied the clinical relevance of pro-IGF-IIE[68-88] and other IGF-related proteins in GIST patients.\nTwenty-four patients were included. Plasma samples were collected before 1 week and median 5 months after start of treatment with imatinib, and levels of IGF-I, total IGF-II, pro-IGF-IIE[68-88], insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, -3 and -6 were determined. GIST specimens from 17 patients and tumour cyst fluid from two patients were analysed for IGF-II and IGFBP-2.\nBefore treatment and/or during follow-up, 3 of 24 (13%) patients showed increased plasma levels of pro-IGF-IIE[68-88]. All three developed NICTH. Overall, patients with metastatic disease, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase activity or total tumour size \u003e12 cm had the highest pro-IGF-IIE[68-88] levels. Most patients had increased plasma IGFBP-2 levels and these levels were significantly higher in patients with progressive disease. (Pro-)IGF-II was expressed in 82% of GISTs and IGFBP-2 only in one case.\nWe identified pro-IGF-IIE[68-88] as a marker that may be used in the surveillance of GIST.","title":"Insulin-like growth factors and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins in relation to disease status and incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients with a gastrointestinal stromal tumour.","pubmedId":"19276395"}
