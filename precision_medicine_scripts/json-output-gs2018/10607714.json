This finding suggests strongly that WT1 protein is a potential target of immunotherapy for human leukemia. In this study, we established a CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone directed against a WT1-derived peptide and examined its immunologic actions on leukemia cells. A CD8(+) CTL clone, designated TAK-1, which lysed autologous cells loaded with a WT1-derived 9-mer peptide consisting of the HLA-A24 (HLA-A*2402)-binding motifs was established by stimulating CD8(+) T lymphocytes from a healthy individual repeatedly with WT1 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells. TAK-1 was cytotoxic to HLA-A24-positive leukemia cells expressing WT1, but not to HLA-A24-positive lymphoma cells that did not express WT1, HLA-A24-negative leukemia cells, or HLA-A24-positive normal cells. Treating leukemia cells with an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the WT1 gene resulted in reduced TAK-1-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that target antigen of TAK-1 on leukemia cells is the naturally processed WT1 peptide in the context of HLA-A24. TAK-1 did not inhibit colony formation by normal bone marrow cells of HLA-A24-positive individuals. Because WT1 is overexpressed ubiquitously in various types of leukemia cells, but not in normal cells, immunotherapy using WT1 peptide-specific CTL clones should be an efficacious treatment for human leukemia.
