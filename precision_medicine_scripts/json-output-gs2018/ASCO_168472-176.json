Anti-Programmed cell Death 1(anti-PD1) drugs have shown activity in metastatic skin melanoma patients (pts) thus granting an approval for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. We report our experience with anti-PD1 in MUM pts. Methods: Ambispective cohort of MUM pts treated with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Institut Curie. Response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were retrieved. Results: 21 evaluable pts started anti-PD1 treatment between June 2015 and January 2016. The population consisted of 10 men and 11 women, median age was 64 (32-77). Nine patients have been enucleated, 12 received proton beam therapy. The median time to first extra-ocular metastasis was 32 months (7-150). Anti-PD1 was prescribed after a median of 2 prior lines of systemic treatment (0-5). Performance status was 0 in 9 and 1 in 11 pts. Metastatic sites at initiation of anti-PD1 were liver, skin, lung, pancreas and bone for 18, 5, 5, 3 and 2 pts respectively. Liver was the sole metastatic site in 10 pts. LDH were above normal levels in 7 pts. Patients received a median number of 4 injections of nivolumab (2-14+) or 4 injections of pembrolizumab (3-4+). No objective response was observed, 6/14 pts showed stable disease as best response. Treatment was not suspended in any patient because of side effects. Median actuarial PFS is 3 months (0-6+). Conclusions: To date, anti-PD1 have shown no activity in our series of MUM pts. A national ambispective study is currently underway to evaluate anti-PD1activity in a larger series associated with biomarkers analyses (i.e. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, genomic status). Until more optimistic results are reported or reliable biomarkers are found, anti-PD1 should not be considered as a standard option in MUM.","title":"Activity of anti-PD1 drugs in uveal melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_168472-176"}
