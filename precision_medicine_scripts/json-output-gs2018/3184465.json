A 61-year-old male, suffering from an anorectal tumor with anal bleeding, underwent an abdominoperineal rectal amputation with an R3 lymphadenectomy. The tumor was a Stage I (H0, P0, N0, S0) malignant melanoma. Despite DAV (DTIC, ACNU, and VCR) therapy, liver metastasis was detected 1 year later and the patient died 1.5 years after the operation. Case 2. A 80-year-old female, complaining of bloody stool, was diagnosed to have an anorectal malignant melanoma. She was at Stage IV and underwent an abdominoperineal rectal amputation with an R3 lymphadenectomy. The tumor 4.5 X 2.7 X 1.2 cm in size, was diagnosed to be at Stage IV (pm, n2+).
