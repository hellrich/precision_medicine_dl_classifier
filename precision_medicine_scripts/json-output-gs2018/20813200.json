This family includes EGFR/ErbB1/HER1, ErbB2/HER2/Neu ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/HER4. For many years it was believed that EGFR plays a minor role in the development and progression of breast malignancies. However, recent findings have led investigators to revisit these beliefs. Here we will review these findings and propose roles that EGFR may play in breast malignancies. In particular, we will discuss the potential roles that EGFR may play in triple-negative tumors, resistance to endocrine therapies, maintenance of stem-like tumor cells, and bone metastasis. Thus, we will propose the contexts in which EGFR may be a therapeutic target.","title":"EGFR signaling in breast cancer: bad to the bone.","pubmedId":"20813200"}
