Recently, 6 cases have been reported in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis coli (Gardners syndrome). Mutations or allelic loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene have therefore been implied in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. The authors analyzed 11 cases of nasopharyngeal angiofibromas from 9 male patients for mutations in the mutation cluster region and allelic loss of the APC gene. Six were primary tumors; 2 first recurrences; and 1, primary tumor with 2 recurrences. Direct sequence analysis was performed on several overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Detection of allelic loss was performed by restriction length polymorphism analysis at a polymorphic locus. No mutation was detected in 11 tumors of 9 different patients. None of the 9 informative (heterozygous) cases carried an allelic loss. We conclude that alterations of the APC gene do not play a major role in the development of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. The coincidence of nasopharyngeal angiofibromas and adenomatous polyposis coli in some families implies the possibility that another gene in this region might be responsible for the development of nasopharyngeal angiofibromas.
