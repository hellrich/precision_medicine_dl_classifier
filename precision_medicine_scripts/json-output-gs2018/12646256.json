Human renal carcinoma cell line, ACHN cells, was transfected with plasmid encoding wild-type HGFR gene to generate cell lines with increased HGFR protein. ACHN cells with elevated HGFR expression, denoted clones 8 and 10, respectively, showed higher basal kinase activities of HGFR and PI3-kinase than those of empty-vector (mock)-transfected cells. Clone 8 and 10 cells grew similar to mock cells in culture. In mice, tumors of these clones grew more rapidly than those of mock cells. Microvessel density of clone 8 or 10 tumors was higher than that of mock tumors. Clone 8 and 10 cells secreted vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) more than mock cells and the secretion was PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002-sensitive. Anti-VEGF-A neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited tumor growth of clones 8 and 10 in mice. These results indicate for the first time that overexpression of HGFR tyrosine kinase in renal carcinoma cells participates in rapid tumor growth in vivo.","title":"Overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor receptor in renal carcinoma cells indirectly stimulates tumor growth in vivo.","pubmedId":"12646256"}
