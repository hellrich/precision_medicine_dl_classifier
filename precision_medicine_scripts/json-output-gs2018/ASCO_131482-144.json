However when PTC loses RAI uptake capacity and becomes RAI-refractory, there are few effective treatments. The majority of well-differentiated thyroid cancers (e.g. PTC) have clinically meaningful alterations in the RAS-RAF pathway, with BRAFV600E being the most common alteration reported. To examine the prevalence of these alterations in metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid carcinoma, we initiated genomic profiling on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded clinical tumor specimens. We report on the first seven completed.  Methods:  A clinical next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligationbased libraries to high, uniform coverage for 3,769 exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer.   Results:  All but one of the patients with PTC had extensive pulmonary metastases and RAI-refractory disease. Five of the seven patients had tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation and one had NRAS Q61R. The seventh had regional recurrence only and the tumor had no detectable mutations. Treatment with the vemurafenib, targeted therapy highly specific to BRAF V600E, was initiated in one patient, resulting in marked clinical and radiographic responses that were complicated by the development of severe keratoacanthosis and HRASQ61L skin cancer. Three other patients have been enrolled on clinical protocols for MEK-targeted therapy, with clinical responses noted, and one is pending enrollment.   Conclusions:  In this clinical series of RAI-resistant metastatic papillary thyroid cancers, the majority have clinically meaningful alterations that can potentially guide targeted treatment decisions, particularly in the MEK pathway including BRAF V600E. Therapeutic interventions targeting BRAF activation may be effective in these cancers, and these patients should be enrolled in clinical trials utilizing BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors.","title":"Targeted treatment of RAI-resistant metastatic thyroid cancer postcomprehensive genomic profiling.","pubmedId":"ASCO_131482-144"}
