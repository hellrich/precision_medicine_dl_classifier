Traditional treatment has now entered into the platform, and treatments based on the detection of biomarkers increasingly become a trend. This review presents several biomarkers of esophageal cancer, including chemotherapy-related biomarkers and targeted drug-related biomarkers, and the correlation of these biomarkers with drug response.","title":"Personalized medicine of esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"23174712"}
