Tumor marker-based biochemical screening and DNA-based genetic screening have created the opportunity for effective prophylactic surgery in patients at risk for hereditary MTC. Complete surgical resection is critical for cure because cervical reoperation for persistent or recurrent disease benefits only select patients. With the advent of therapies that target the RET-activated pathways, new hope may be emerging for patients who have locally advanced or metastatic disease.","title":"Medullary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"16882502"}
