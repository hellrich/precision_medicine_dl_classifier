She was treated with preoperative chemotherapy with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel followed by epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and fluorouracil. She was judged to have achieved a clinical complete response after 4 courses of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel, and she then underwent partial resection of the right breast and sentinel lymph node dissection. Pathological examination revealed that a pathological complete response was achieved. Combination therapy with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel seems to be a useful preoperative chemotherapy regimen for HER2-positive breast cancer.","title":"[A case of HER2-positive breast cancer for which preoperative chemotherapy with pertuzumab resulted in a pathological complete response].","pubmedId":"25963698"}
