A significant association was observed between MAGE-A3 expressions, assessed by quantitative real-time RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with advanced stages of disease (P \u003c 0.05). Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and International Prognostic Index (IPI) score were significantly higher in MAGE-A3-positive patients (P \u003d 0.025 and P \u003d 0.004, respectively). Expression of MAGE-A3 was associated with poor response to treatment and a significantly shorter overall survival (P \u003c 0.001). Our data address new information in the association of MAGE-A3 expression and poor prognosis in DLBCL patients.","title":"MAGE-A3 expression is an adverse prognostic factor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"22183072"}
