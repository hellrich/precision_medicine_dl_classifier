Molecular targeted therapy has become aÂ trend in treating tumors, including gliomas. However, molecular characteristics vary among different kinds of tumors and ethnic groups.\nThe aim of the research was to study the expression characteristics of key components in the EGFR pathway of gliomas in order to contribute new data for the molecular targeted treatment of gliomas.\nEGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PI3K, phospho-EGFR and Ki67 expression were detected with immunohistochemistry in 82 glioma specimens.\nThe expression of EGFR was positively correlated with the patients\u0027 age. There were no significant differences in clinicopathological characteristics between gliomas with and without phospho-EGFR expression. EGFR overexpression was significantly correlated with phospho-EGFR expression. In gliomas with EGFR activation, overexpressions of EGFR, BRAF and PI3K were significantly correlated with proliferation. However, in gliomas without phospho-EGFR expression, only BRAF overexpression was significantly related to the proliferation of tumor cells.\nBRAF overexpression could be an independent factor causing tumorigenesis in gliomas regardless of phospho-EGFR expression. The molecular characteristics can vary with the increasing age of glioma patients.","title":"BRAF overexpression induces rampant glioma proliferation independent of phospho-EGFR expression.","pubmedId":"25618114"}
