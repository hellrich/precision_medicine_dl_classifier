The maximum period of observation varied from 5 to 12 years. The survival of prednisone-treated patients (median survival time 38 months) and placebo-treated patients (median survival time 34 months) with alcoholic hepatitis did not differ significantly. This was also true for each of the two subgroups comprising mild and severe cases respectively. The presence of morphologically defined alcoholic hepatitis was postively correlated with the daily consumption of alcohol but poorly correlated with the clinical syndrome usually attributed to alcoholic hepatitis.","title":"Alcoholic hepatitis superimposed on cirrhosis.
