The subtypes of melanomas arising from different parts of the body have variable c-kit or BRAF mutation frequencies. Few studies in the literature have examined c-kit and BRAF mutation status in melanomas that occur in the anus and rectum. In this study, we analyzed 40 cases of anorectal melanoma for c-kit and BRAF mutations by DNA sequencing using paraffin-embedded tissues. c-kit Mutations were detected in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17. CD117 expression in tumor cells was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Our study showed that a c-kit mutation was found in 7 of the 40 cases of anorectal melanoma. CD117 expression was detected in 16 of the 40 cases, and 3 of these 16 cases also had c-kit mutations. Mutations in BRAF were also identified in 2 patients. These results indicate that a subset of anorectal melanomas have activating c-kit mutations, which suggests that kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may be used to treat this subset of melanoma patients. In addition, our results show that c-kit mutations do not correlate with CD117 expression.","title":"c-kit gene mutation and CD117 expression in human anorectal melanomas.","pubmedId":"22154054"}
