In addition, somatic RET proto-oncogene mutations have been identified in a subset of sporadic medullary carcinomas and phaeochromocytomas. This study investigated the possibility that RET plays a role in sporadic parathyroid neoplasia. Firstly, normal and neoplastic parathyroid tissues were screened for expression of the RET proto-oncogene, using an RT-PCR approach on autopsy material. Secondly, 20 archival parathyroid adenomas were screened for somatic mutations in the transmembrane region of RET, the region associated with germline mutations in MEN2A and hence parathyroid disease, using a PCR-solid phase direct sequencing approach. RET expression was identified in all the parathyroid tissues analysed. However, no mutations were identified in any of the 20 adenomas, suggesting either that other mechanisms of RET activation occur, such as translocation, or that RET plays a more minor role in the growth control of the parathyroid cells than in C cells or phaeochromocytes.","title":"Analysis of the RET proto-oncogene in sporadic parathyroid adenomas.","pubmedId":"8976870"}
