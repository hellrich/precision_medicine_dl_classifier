Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to separate the integrin β1(high/+) cell population from the integrin β1(low/-) population in HNSCC cell lines. These two populations and integrin β1 shRNA knockdown HNSCC cells were examined for the effect of integrin β1 on invasion in vitro and on lymph node and lung metastases in a xenograft mouse model. Expression and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) were examined by zymography.\nStatistical analysis showed that integrin β1 expression was significantly higher in the metastatic primary tumors than in the nonmetastatic tumors (42.6% vs. 24.8%, P \u003c 0.0001 and P \u003c 0.0001 by univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively). In patients with lymph node metastasis, integrin β1 expression was inversely correlated with overall survival (P \u003d 0.035). The integrin β1 knockdown or integrin β1(low/-) HNSCC cells showed a significant reduction in lymph node and lung metastases in vivo (P \u003c 0.001 and P \u003c 0.05, respectively). Significantly reduced Matrigel invasion capability was also found in integrin β1 knockdown or integrin β1(low/-) HNSCC cells (P \u003c 0.01). Finally, zymography results showed integrin β1-affected HNSCC invasion by regulating MMP-2 activation.\nThese findings indicate that integrin β1 has a major impact on HNSCC prognosis through its regulation of metastasis.","title":"The pivotal role of integrin β1 in metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"22829201"}
