The bladder tumor was submitted to histopathology without accompanying clinical history, and an initial diagnosis of high-grade urothelial carcinoma was rendered based on epithelioid and sarcomatoid appearing pleomorphic histopathology. We present this case to highlight the diagnostic challenge presented by the rare occurrence of metastatic melanoma to the urinary bladder and the potential pitfall of this lesion being diagnosed as high-grade urothelial carcinoma in the presence of limited clinical history.
