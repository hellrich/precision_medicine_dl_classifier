The antibody reacts specifically with cells from human melanocytic lesions, ie, common acquired nevi, primary and metastatic melanoma biopsies. No reactivity with other cells, including normal melanocytes, was observed in the biopsies or with cells in biopsies from normal tissue (skin, liver, lung, spleen) and from other malignancies including those of neuroectodermal origin. The reactivity was very weak and variable in metastatic melanomas but very strong and characteristic of a receptor-type antigen in primary melanomas, a stage in melanoma progression in which cells have acquired metastasizing potential. It is suggested that the antigen recognized may be involved in growth promotion and represents the human equivalent of the fish melanoma gene product.","title":"A putative marker for human melanoma.
