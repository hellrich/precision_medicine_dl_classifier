To examine the possible significance of alterations associated with the tumor suppressor gene, MMAC/PTEN, in prostate carcinoma, the biological and biochemical effects of MMAC/PTEN expression were examined in LNCaP cells, which are devoid of a functional gene product. Acute expression of MMAC/PTEN via an adenoviral construct resulted in a dose-dependent and specific inhibition of Akt/PKB activation, consistent with the phosphatidylinositol phosphatase activity of MMAC/PTEN. MMAC/PTEN expression induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, although to a lesser extent than that observed with p53 via an adenoviral construct. However, MMAC/PTEN expression produced a growth inhibition that was significantly greater than that achieved with p53. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in LNCaP cells blocked MMAC/PTEN- and p53-induced apoptosis but not the growth-suppressive effects of MMAC/ PTEN, suggesting that the growth regulatory effects of MMAC/PTEN involve multiple pathways. These studies further implicate the loss of MMAC/PTEN as a significant event in prostate cancer and suggest that reintroduction of MMAC/PTEN into deficient prostate cancer cells may have therapeutic implications.","title":"Regulation of Akt/PKB activity, cellular growth, and apoptosis in prostate carcinoma cells by MMAC/PTEN.","pubmedId":"10363971"}
