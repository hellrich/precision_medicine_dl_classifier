In many cases, genomic rearrangements lead to the fusion of unrelated genes to the DNA coding for the kinase domain of RTKs. All RTK-derived fusion proteins reported so far display oligomerization sequences within the 5\u0027 fusion partners that are responsible for oncogenic activation. Here, we report a mechanism by which an altered RTK gains oncogenic potential in a glioblastoma cell line. A microdeletion on 6q21 results in the fusion of FIG, a gene coding for a Golgi apparatus-associated protein, to the kinase domain of the protooncogene c-ROS. The fused protein product FIG-ROS is a potent oncogene, and its transforming potential resides in its ability to interact with and become localized to the Golgi apparatus. Thus we have found a RTK fusion protein whose subcellular location leads to constitutive kinase activation and results in oncogenic transformation.","title":"Oncogenic targeting of an activated tyrosine kinase to the Golgi apparatus in a glioblastoma.","pubmedId":"12538861"}
