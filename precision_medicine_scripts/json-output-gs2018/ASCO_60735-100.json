It has been demonstrated that adding trastuzumab to taxane-based chemotherapy increases significantly the pathologic response in patients with Her2 overexpression (h2N-OE). The polymorphism 655 G\u003eA (isoleucine\u003evaline) has been associated a high risk of breast cancer (BC) as well as with an increased risk of cardiotoxicity in woman with metastatic BC who received trastuzumab every tree weeks. The aim of our study evaluated the frequency of the Her2 655 G\u003eA polymorphism in Mexican patients with locally advanced BC (LABC) and in healthy Mexican individuals, as well as its association with pathological response and cardiotoxicity after trastuzumab treatment. Methods: Women with LABC, who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT) with FAC 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) for 12 weeks were included. Patients with h2N-OE received trastuzumab load dose of 4 mg/kg and 2 mg/m2 weekly during neoadjuvant CT. Her2 polymorphism was determined by RFLP. Cardiac toxicity was measured with MUGA at baseline and the end of treatment. Results: The frequency of the polymorphic variant in healthy individuals was 21% and in patients with LABC 25% (p \u003d 0.3). Of the 113 patients, 55% overexpressed Her2 and received trastuzumab. This polymorphism was associated with high tumor grade or SBR (p \u003d 0.02). Patients with the polymorphism had less pathologic response (OR 2.8; 95% CI, 1.09 to 7.08; p \u003d 0.03). Patients with h2N-OE and the polymorphism exhibited less pathologic response (OR 5; 95% CI, 1.41 to 17.72; p \u003d 0.009). Residual tumor and stage III disease are associated with less overall survival (p \u003d 0.0001; p \u003d 0.025, respectively). Conclusions: The polymorphism Her2 655 G\u003eA is associated with less rate of pathologic complete response (15% vs 85%). This finding suggests the possibility of a new mechanism of resistance to trastuzumab, due to structural changes in the polymorphic protein. There is a need to increase the sample size, as well as testing different molecules (e.g., TKIs) to confirm this hypothesis.","title":"Association of HER2 655 G\u003eA polymorphism with less pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_60735-100"}
