RET is the oncogene that causes papillary thyroid carcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma. The latter may arise as a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndromes; germline mutations in RET are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 inheritance. In this report we review data on the mechanisms leading to RET oncogenic conversion and on RET targeting as a strategy in thyroid cancer treatment.","title":"Minireview: RET: normal and abnormal functions.","pubmedId":"15331579"}
