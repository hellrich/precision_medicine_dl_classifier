It has been reported that CD109 is highly expressed in various tumor cell lines and in tumor tissues including squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the lung, oral cavity, esophagus and uterine cervix, malignant melanoma of the skin, and urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder. CD109 is, therefore, thought to be a cancer-related gene. On the other hand, CD109 is a component of TGF- receptor system and negatively regulates TGF- signaling. However, its physiological function in vivo remains largely unknown. To investigate the physiological function of CD109 in vivo, we generated CD109-deficient (CD109-/-) mice in which exon 1 and 2 of CD109 genomic locus were replaced with the lacZ gene. CD109 protein is expressed in the skin, tongue, and testis of adult CD109+/+ mice, but not in CD109-/- mice. Macroscopically, CD109-/- mice showed hair growth impairment from postnatal day 7 (P7) and persisted until P28. Microscopically, hyperplasia of the epidermis and sebaceous glands became apparent at P7 in CD109-/- mice and sustained until P70, and the hair follicles of CD109-/- mice exhibited ectasia with kinked hair shafts at P14. The epidermis of CD109-/- mice showed apparent thickening of the basal / suprabasal layers, which are positive for CK14, compared with CD109+/+ mice, whereas no significant differences in Ki-67 or cleaved caspase-3-positive ratios were detected between the two groups. These results suggest that CD109 regulates the differentiation of keratinocytes in vivo, and impairment of hair growth and ectatic hair follicles may be secondary changes caused by narrowing of the infundibular portion of the hair follicles due to epithelial hyperplasia.","title":"Deficiency of CD109, a negative regulator of TGF- signaling, leads epidermal hyperplasia and appendage abnormalities in mice","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-4250"}
