Most of these chemotherapeutic trials consisted of single-agent regimens, namely, fluorouracil, methotrexate, thiotepa, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan. Our data suggest that responsiveness of advanced male breast cancer to systemic chemotherapeutic agents is the same as that reported for advanced female breast cancer.","title":"Chemotherapy for advanced male breast cancer.","pubmedId":"7365938"}
