Sixty four patients with melanoma brain metastases were treated in our department within a 15-year period. We performed a retrospective analysis of their survival with respect to the type of treatment instituted. Four groups were formed according to treatment: Group A patients treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy; group B temozolomide as first-line treatment and radiotherapy after cerebral disease progression; group C radiotherapy alone; group D supportive care only. Patients* characteristics influenced the selection of treatment modality: Group A (7.8%) patients with a single brain metastasis (p\u003d0.001) and controlled extra-cranial disease (p\u003c0.0001), while Group D (21.8%) patients with ulcerated primary lesions (p\u003d0.010) and uncontrolled extra-cranial disease (p\u003c0.0001). Only group B (26.6%) and C (43.7%) patients with similar characteristics including more than one brain lesion. Median overall survival was 3 months. In univariate analysis, median survival for groups A, B, C and D was 12, 5, 3 and 2 months, respectively (p\u003c0.0001). The survival difference between the surgery and non-surgery groups was statistically significant (p\u003d0.0011). Patients treated with supportive care had the worse prognosis (p\u003c0.0001). A survival benefit for patients receiving first-line treatment with temozolomide, as compared to those receiving radiotherapy alone was noted (p\u003d0.0267). In multivariate survival analysis, the number of brain lesions (p\u003d0.0138), the absence of uncontrolled extra-cranial disease (p\u003d0.00221) and the type of treatment for the cerebral disease (p\u003d0.0053) remained significant independent survival predictors. Patients\u0027 characteristics remain a critical factor for treatment selection. The number of brain metastases, the extent of disease and the type of treatment represent independent survival predictors. Melanoma patients with a single brain metastasis and controlled extra-cranial disease gain a survival benefit, if surgically treated. Including temozolomide in the first-line treatment of melanoma patients with brain metastases who would have been treated with radiotherapy alone, might present a promising future direction affecting the length of survival.","title":"Cerebral metastases of malignant melanoma: contemporary treatment modalities and survival outcome.","pubmedId":"15800714"}
