Current Sanger sequencing assays to detect IDH mutations are labor intensive and not cost effective for clinical testing of low-frequency mutations. Therefore, we developed clinical assays using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis to screen for all four variants listed above, followed by Sanger sequencing confirmation. The sensitivities of the assays were 7.3% and 7.9% for the detection of IDH2 and IDH1 variants, respectively, against the background of wild-type transcripts. Comparison of HRM to Sanger sequencing on 146 AML bone marrow samples for validation showed near-perfect concordance for all positive and negative results for IDH1 (98%) and IDH2 (94%). Postvalidation clinical implementation of upfront HRM screening (N \u003d 106), using a more conservative algorithm to avoid false-negative results, reduced the number of Sanger sequencing tests by 73% (IDH1) and 78% (IDH2). Of the variant calls made by HRM in postvalidation clinical samples, Sanger confirmed the presence of a variant in 62% (IDH1) and 44% (IDH2) of the samples. In conclusion, our HRM assays are rapid, convenient, and versatile assays for screening and confirmation of alterations in IDH1 and IDH2.","title":"Diagnostic testing for IDH1 and IDH2 variants in acute myeloid leukemia an algorithmic approach using high-resolution melting curve analysis.","pubmedId":"21889610"}
