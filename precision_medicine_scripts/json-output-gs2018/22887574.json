However, the actual distance between these fusion partners has never been determined. The phenomenon of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is observed when a donor fluorophore is close (\u003c10 nm) to transfer some of it energy to an acceptor fluorophore. The aim of this study was to validate the use of FRET on directly labeled DNA molecules to assess the frequency of positioning at \u003c10 nm distances between genes known to be involved in rearrangement and to correlate it with their probability to undergo rearrangement. In the validation experiments, the frequency of FRET-sensitized emission (SE) was found to be 93-96% between probes for the immediately adjacent chromosomal regions as compared to 0.1-0.2% between probes for the random loci located on large linear separation. Further, we found that the frequency of FRET-SE between four pairs of genes that form rearrangements in thyroid cancer was 5% for RET and CCDC6, 4% for RET and NCOA4, 2% for BRAF and AKAP9, and 2% for NTRK1 and TPR. Moreover, the frequency with which FRET was observed showed strong correlation (r \u003d 0.9871) with the prevalence of respective rearrangements in thyroid cancer. Our findings demonstrate that FRET can be used as a technique to analyze proximity between specific DNA regions and that the frequency of gene positioning at distances allowing FRET correlates with their probability to undergo chromosomal rearrangements.","title":"Frequency of close positioning of chromosomal loci detected by FRET correlates with their participation in carcinogenic rearrangements in human cells.","pubmedId":"22887574"}
