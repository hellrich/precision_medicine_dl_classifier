Benign uterine disease is well-demonstrated using rapid sequences and minimal examination time,whereas evaluation of malignancy is best performed with high-resolution techniques. Wide-spread availability of ultrafast sequences has expanded MR imaging applications to include evaluation of pelvic floor relaxation and fetal anomalies. Promising developments, such as new contrast agents, MR-guided focused ultrasound,and 3 tesla imaging, suggest continued advancement of MR imaging in the care of patients who have gynecologic disease.","title":"Female pelvis.","pubmedId":"15935318"}
