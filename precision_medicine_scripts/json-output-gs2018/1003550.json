After oophorectomy, the growth rate was similar to that in normal and castrated male mice and was not altered in pregnant mice. The growth in vitro was similar in the presence of serum from normal and castrated male and female mice.","title":"Endrocrine factors and the growth and spread of B16 melanoma.","pubmedId":"1003550"}
