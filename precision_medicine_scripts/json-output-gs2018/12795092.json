Cases of malignant melanoma in the alimentary tract have mostly originated from the esophagus and an anorectal lesion. Metastatic tumors occurred mainly in the stomach and the small intestine. Although resection with lymph node dissection was performed, the prognosis of these patients was worse than that of patients with carcinoma. Malignant melanoma of the alimentary tract might be more aggressive than that of the skin. A combined modality treatment including progressive chemotherapy and biotherapy is expected to improve the prognosis of these patients.","title":"[Malignant melanoma of the alimentary tract].","pubmedId":"12795092"}
