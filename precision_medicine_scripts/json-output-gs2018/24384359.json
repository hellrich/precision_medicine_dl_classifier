The median overall survival among inpatient rehabilitation patients was 14.3 versus 17.9 months for patients who did not undergo inpatient rehabilitation (P \u003d .03). However, after we adjusted for age, extent of resection, and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale scores, we found no statistical difference in the survival rate between patients who did and did not undergo inpatient rehabilitation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; P \u003d .16). Among the patients who underwent inpatient rehabilitation, older age (HR, 2.24; P \u003d .0006), a low degree of resection (HR, 1.67; P \u003d .02), and lack of a Stupp regimen (HR, 1.71; P \u003d .05) were associated with greater hazard of mortality.\nPatients who undergo inpatient rehabilitation demonstrate significant functional improvements, primarily in the mobility domain. Confounder adjusted multivariate analysis showed no survival difference between patients who did and did not undergo inpatient rehabilitation; this finding suggests that a structured inpatient rehabilitation program may level the survival field in lower-functioning patients who otherwise may be faced with a dismal prognosis.","title":"The impact of inpatient rehabilitation on function and survival of newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma.","pubmedId":"24384359"}
