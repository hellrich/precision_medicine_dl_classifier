There is controversy regarding the best surgical treatment because of its poor prognosis. Three cases with extended follow-up are reported in this article. A 53-year-old woman with rectal bleeding was diagnosed with a melanoma of the rectum and underwent an abdominoperineal resection. The patient died with distant metastases 8 months later. An 80-year-old woman with rectal bleeding was diagnosed with a melanoma of the rectum and underwent a transanal local excision. She remains alive 4 years later but with locally recurrent disease. A 78-year-old man with rectal bleeding was diagnosed with a melanoma of the rectum and underwent an abdominoperineal resection. He died with local and metastatic disease 25 months later. Recent trends favor local excision when technically feasible, although some patients may require an abdominoperineal resection of the rectum, especially for larger tumors.","title":"Anorectal melanoma: report of three cases with extended follow-up.","pubmedId":"15043345"}
