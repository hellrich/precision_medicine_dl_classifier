A 74-year-old man presented with swelling and mild pain of the right cheek. CT scan showed a mass measuring approximately 4 cm, with marked bone destruction in the right maxillary sinus. A surgically resected specimen revealed that the tumor was comprised of three different components: HGA and solid-type ACC in the central portion and lower-grade ACC in the periphery. The tumor was discriminated from a dedifferentiated carcinoma or hybrid tumor. Autopsy specimens also demonstrated both solid-type ACC and HGA components in the lung and spleen. Immunohistochemically, positive staining of p53 protein was detected on both solid-type ACC and HGA cells, but cyclin D1 and HER2/neu was only seen in HGA cells. Solid-type ACC cells were immunoreactive for CD117 (c-kit), but lower-grade ACC and HGA cells were negative. This case suggests that the overexpression of CD117, p53 protein, cyclin D1, and HER2/neu might be involved in the progression from lower-grade ACC to solid-type ACC and HGA.","title":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the maxillary sinus with gradual histologic transformation to high-grade adenocarcinoma: a comparative report with dedifferentiated carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16133359"}
