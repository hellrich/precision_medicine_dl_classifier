Abs that recognize these tumor-associated MHC-peptide complexes, with the same specificity as TCR, would therefore be valuable reagents for studying Ag presentation by tumor cells, for visualizing MHC-peptide complexes on cells, and eventually for developing new targeting agents for cancer immunotherapy. To generate molecules with such a unique, fine specificity, we immunized HLA-A2 transgenic mice with a single-chain HLA-A2, complexed with a common antigenic T cell HLA-A2-restricted epitope derived from the melanoma differentiation Ag gp100. Using a phage display approach, we isolated a recombinant scFv Ab that exhibits a characteristic TCR-like binding specificity, yet, unlike TCRs, it did so with a high affinity in the nanomolar range. The TCR-like Ab can recognize the native MHC-peptide complex expressed on the surface of APCs, and on peptide-pulsed or native melanoma cells. Moreover, when fused to a very potent cytotoxic effector molecule in the form of a truncated bacterial toxin, it was able to specifically kill APCs in a peptide-dependent manner. These results demonstrate the utility of high affinity TRC-like scFv recombinant Abs directed toward human cancer T cell epitopes. Such TCR-like Abs may prove to be very useful for monitoring and visualizing the expression of specific MHC-peptide complexes on the surface of tumor cells, APCs, and lymphoid tissues, as well as for developing a new family of targeting agents for immunotherapy.","title":"Selective targeting of melanoma and APCs using a recombinant antibody with TCR-like specificity directed toward a melanoma differentiation antigen.","pubmedId":"12928363"}
