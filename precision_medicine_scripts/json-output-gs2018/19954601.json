HL-60 and K562 cells were treated by 2-deoxy-5-azacytidine (DAC) or ATRA respectively. Bisulfite modified DNA of these cells were amplified with PCR and quantitatively analyzed by pyrosequencing for methylation of CpG islands.\nIn normal cells, CpGs at all loci of HOX A cluster were unmethylated. In HOX A4, A6, A7, A9, A10 and A11, many CpG sites were methylated (\u003e20%) or hypermethylated (\u003e50%) in leukemia cell lines. Percentages of methylated CpGs were higher in T-cell leukemia (71.4%) and B-cell leukemia (85.7%) than in others. For individual CpGs methylations there were HOX A4 in all leukemia cells, HOX A6 and HOX A7 in most of the leukemia samples and HOX A10 and HOX A11 in K562 and HL-60 cells (38%-86%). HOX A9 CpGs showed hypomethylation in most of myeloid leukemia cells, whereas HOX A11 CpGs were hypermethylated in B-cell leukemia (\u003e50%). Methylation levels of HOX A4 and A6 in AML and ALL patients after complete remission were decreased obviously, and so did HOX A6 and A9 in CML patients. Methylation levels of HOX A4, A6 and A10 in HL-60 cells and of HOX A6 in K562 cells were reduced by ATRA treatment.\nIn all leukemia cell lines, aberrant methylation of CpGs was observed at promoter regions of 6 HOX A cluster genes, and some of these genes showed leukemia-type-specific hypermethylation. CpGs methylation of some HOX A genes in leukemia cell lines, especially in HL-60 cells, were down-regulated by ATRA.","title":"[Aberrant methylation at promoter region of HOX A gene cluster in leukemia cells].","pubmedId":"19954601"}
