To infer methylation-driven changes in expression in subtypes of HNSCC, we integrated global gene expression and DNA methylation measurements in 44 HNSCC and 25 normal samples using a matrix factorization algorithm. This algorithm incorporated novel models to transform methylation and expression measurements to a common scale. Although unsupervised, this integrated matrix factorization inferred patterns common to gene expression and methylation data that differentiate clinical subtypes within the 44 HNSCC samples, including notably HPV status and tumor site. Informatic analysis of the genes associated with these patterns identified specific pathway activity related to HPV status. This algorithm uniquely linked DNA methylation changes and reactivation of genes in the Hedgehog pathway predominantly in HPV-negative samples. We further examined the pathway by determining expression levels of GLI1, one of the downstream target genes of the Hedgehog pathway, in two independent cohorts. We confirmed that GLI1 expression was higher in tumors compared to normal samples and HPV-negative tumors had higher GLI1 expression compared to HPV-positive tumors, suggesting that increased expression of GLI1 plays a role in HPV-negative HNSCC.","title":"An integrated matrix factorization algorithm for DNA methylation and gene expression identi es HNSCC clinical subtypes and GLI1 signaling speci c to HPV-negative HNSCC.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-2901"}
