Expression of survivin protein in 5 case of BPH was negative. The positive rate of PTEN was 30.23%, and the higher the grade and the clinical stage of tumors were, the lower the expression of PTEN was, PTEN of 5 case of BPH was positive.\nThe positively correlation was found between the abnormal expressions of survivin protein, PTEN and the biological behavior of prostatic carcinoma (PCa). Detection of survivin combined with PTEN is valuable for diagnosing PCa, and evaluating malignancy extent and prognosis.","title":"[Expression and significance of survivin protein, PTEN in prostatic cancer].","pubmedId":"16683571"}
