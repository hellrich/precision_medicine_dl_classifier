Various kinds of tumors have mutations in this gene, including glioblastoma, endometrial carcinoma and prostate cancer. We examined 29 cases of primary non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma (NHL) for mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene. One case of diffuse large B cell lymphoma had an 11 bp deletion, but the remaining 28 cases showed no mutations in the genome. Two of these 28 cases showed missense mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 transcripts, but no alterations in the genomic DNA. These mRNA missense variants are similar to PTEN/MMAC1 transcript aberrations which have been reported in patients with breast cancer. These findings suggest that alterations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene play a role in the pathogenesis of NHL.","title":"Mutational analysis of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma.","pubmedId":"9697884"}
