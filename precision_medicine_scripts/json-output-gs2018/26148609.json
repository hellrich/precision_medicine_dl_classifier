It is critical in activating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair upon damage, and thus preserving genomic stability. TP53 is implicated in tumor progression. Melanoma results from transformed melanocytes in the skin. Data gathered on the association between the TP53 Arg72, Pro72 (rs1042522; G\u003eC) polymorphism and melanoma are conflicting.\nTo assess the relationship between the TP53 genotype and the risk of melanoma, we performed a meta-analysis.\nWe searched on PubMed for studies of TP53 polymorphism published in English up to 12 th April 2014. For each study, we calculated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), assuming frequency of allele comparison, heterozygote comparison, homozygote comparison, dominant, and recessive genetic models. Seven case-control studies were carried out during the meta-analysis.\nThe TP53 Callele was not associated with the risk of melanoma in the frequency of allele comparison (C vs G: OR \u003d 1.031; 95% CI \u003d 0.824-1.290; P \u003c 0.001 for heterogeneity). The TP53 GC genotype was not associated with the risk of melanoma as compared with the GG genotype (GC vs GG: OR \u003d 0.922; 95% CI \u003d 0.716-1.186; P \u003d 0.010 for heterogeneity). The TP53 CC genotype was not associated with the risk of melanoma as revealed by both the homozygote comparison and the recessive genetic model. Analysis of the dominant model also did not indicate a significant association between the TP53 polymorphism and melanoma.\nThis meta-analysis suggests that genotypes for the TP53 rs1042522 G\u003eC polymorphism might not be associated with the risk of melanoma.","title":"TP 53 polymorphisms and melanoma: A meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"26148609"}
