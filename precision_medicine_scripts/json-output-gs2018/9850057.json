Binding sites for members of the Ets family of transcription factors are present within MMP promoters and are potent positive regulators. We report a single nucleotide polymorphism at -1607 bp in the MMP-1 promoter, where an additional guanine (G) creates an Ets binding site, 5\u0027-GGA-3\u0027. This polymorphism displays significantly higher transcription in normal fibroblasts and in melanoma cells than the 1 G polymorphism, and it binds substantially more nuclear extract and recombinant ETS-1. Analysis of control DNAs from the Center d\u0027Etude du Polymorphisme Humain pedigrees reveals that this polymorphism is not a mutation, with a frequency of the 2 G polymorphism at 30%. In contrast, in eight tumor cell lines, this frequency increased to 62.5% (P \u003c 0.0001). Thus, this MMP-1 polymorphism contributes to increased transcription, and cells expressing the 2 G polymorphism may provide a mechanism for more aggressive matrix degradation, thereby facilitating cancer progression.","title":"A single nucleotide polymorphism in the matrix metalloproteinase-1 promoter creates an Ets binding site and augments transcription.","pubmedId":"9850057"}
