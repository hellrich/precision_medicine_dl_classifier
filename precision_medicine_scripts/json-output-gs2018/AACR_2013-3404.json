In addition to driving proliferation of resistant cells, this pathway also stimulated invasion and metastasis. EGFR inhibitors cooperated with BRAF inhibitors to block the growth of the resistant cells in vitro and in vivo, and monotherapy with the broad specificity tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib blocked growth and metastasis in vivo. We analyzed a tumor from a BRAF mutant patient with intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib. Vemurafenib treatment induced SFK activation in this tumor and we show that dasatinib blocked its growth and metastasis in immunocompromised mice. Our data shows that BRAF inhibitor-mediated activation of EFGR/SFK/STAT3 signaling can mediate resistance in BRAF mutant melanoma patients. We describe two treatments that appear to overcome this resistance and could deliver therapeutic efficacy in drug-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma patients.","title":"Inhibiting EGF receptor or SRC family kinase signaling overcomes BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-3404"}
