The extracted RNA was amplified and the sequences were analyzed by Sanger sequencing for ROS1-positive samples.\nROS1 rearrangement was identified in 53 specimens (3.2%) from the 1 652 NSCLC tissues. Among these positive cases, 15 were CD74-ROS1, 13 were SLC34A2-ROS1, 13 were SDC4-ROS1 and 12 were TPM3-ROS1. The frequency of ROS1 rearrangement was significantly higher in never-smoking patients (49 cases) than in smokers (4 cases) (P \u003c 0.05). Patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC tended to be younger and there was no significant difference in sex (P \u003e 0.05). All of the ROS1-positive samples were adenocarcinomas, with a tendency toward higher clinical stage (P \u003c 0.05).\nROS1 rearrangement has diversity, and may be defined as a new molecular subtype of NSCLC. ROS1 rearrangement tends to occur in younger, and never-smoker lung adenocarcinoma patients.","title":"[Detection of ROS1 gene rearrangement by FISH and analysis of its clinical features in non-small cell lung cancer patients].","pubmedId":"25567305"}
