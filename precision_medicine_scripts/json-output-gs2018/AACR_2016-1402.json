Ipilimumab blocks the inhibitory immune checkpoint, CTLA-4, which enhances T cell responses and induces both clinical benefit and unique toxicities in a subset of patients with advanced cancer. We designed a clinical study combining ipilimumab with finite ADT in men with metastatic prostate cancer to estimate therapeutic efficacy, determine safety, and identify predictive biomarkers for clinical outcomes.Methods: We screened 30 patients and enrolled 27 patients between July, 2011 and June, 2013 for an open-labelled, single-center, Phase II study of ipilimumab plus finite ADT as first-line therapy for metastatic non-castrate prostate cancer. Eligible patients had histological confirmation of prostate carcinoma and radiographic documentation of metastatic disease. ADT was given for a finite duration of eight months with concurrent ipilimumab (10 mg/kg) for up to four doses, each given four-weeks apart. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with undetectable PSA (0.2 ng/mL) at seven months post-treatment initiation with ADT. In addition, we performed comprehensive immune monitoring of the peripheral blood using multi-parametric flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing of T cell receptors.Findings: All 27 of the enrolled patients were evaluable for safety and toxicity, and 24 of these patients were evaluable for therapeutic effectiveness. Ten of the 24 (42%) patients achieved the primary endpoint of undetectable PSA levels at seven months post-treatment initiation. The median time to PSA progression was 10.0 (IQR 5.9-13.3) months from treatment initiation, and one (4%) of the 24 patients continues to have a PSA response that is ongoing for 40.7 months. The trial was closed as prespecified due to grade 3 toxicities that occurred in 12 (44%) of 27 patients. The most common grade 3 adverse events were transaminitis, colitis/diarrhea, and hypophysitis. Immunological biomarkers were identified that potentially predict for clinical benefit and grade 3 toxicities in this small study. No grade 4 or 5 toxicities were observed.Interpretation: Although the combination of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab plus finite ADT led to toxicities that met a prespecified endpoint for closure of the trial, our current knowledge and experience about combination therapies and dose of ipilimumab leads us to postulate that additional clinical trials evaluating ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg plus ADT is warranted. In addition, we identified candidate immunological biomarkers that need to be further tested as predictive markers of clinical benefit and grade 3 toxicities.","title":"Exploratory biomarkers that predict for clinical outcomes in a Phase II trial with ipilimumab plus finite androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic non-castrate prostate cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1402"}
