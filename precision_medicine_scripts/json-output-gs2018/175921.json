In Friend leukemia, Friend virus induces permanent differentiation of erythropoietin-responsive cells. This erythropoietic proliferation and maturation is accompanied by a marked cell loss and provokes enlargement of the stem cell compartment. The so-called leukemic cells have a limited proliferation capacity and may not be truly malignant as opposed to blastic cells in acute leukemias. Clinical, hematological, and physiopathological data that are presently available in chronic granulocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera, and the erythroblastic component of erythroleukemia are compatible with the Friend physiopathological model. It is suggested that these differentiated leukemias initiate from an uncontrolled differentiation of a committed cell compartment, which stimulates proliferation of the stem cell compartment. The disease would be due to a proliferation and accumulation of \"subnormal\" cells characterized by a shorter mean life-span than the normal differentiated cell population. Although limited, the data available suggest that the physiopathology of acute leukemias is clearly distinguishable from that of differentiated leukemias; several immunological and therapeutic applications of this model are outlined.","title":"Physiopathology of human and virus-induced murine leukemias.","pubmedId":"175921"}
