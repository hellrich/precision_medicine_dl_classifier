The products of these oncogenes, including BCR-ABL, TEL-PDGFR, Flt3 and c-Kit, have elevated tyrosine kinase activity and transform haematopoietic cells, mainly by augmentation of proliferation and enhanced viability. Activated ABL kinases are associated with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Mutations in platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta are associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Flt3 or c-Kit cooperate with other types of oncogenes to create fully transformed acute leukaemias. Elevated activity of these tyrosine kinases is crucial for transformation, thus making the kinase domain an ideal target for therapeutic intervention. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors for various kinases are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and are potentially useful therapeutic agents in myeloid leukaemias. Here, the authors review the signalling activities, mechanism of transformation and therapeutic targeting of several tyrosine kinase oncogenes important in myeloid leukaemias.","title":"Targeting mutated tyrosine kinases in the therapy of myeloid leukaemias.","pubmedId":"15161429"}
