In both patients, there was a clinical response to treatment coincident with depigmentation of skin and hair. Skin biopsies showed extensive infiltration with CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes rather than CD57+ in the depigmented areas suggestive of a specific MHC-related cytotoxic T-cell activity against melanocytes. In keeping with this, MHCII expression was markedly up-regulated. These observations suggest the development of a simultaneous anti-tumour and anti-melanocyte immune response stimulated by chemoimmunotherapy, possibly against the same or similar antigens.","title":"The histological and immunohistochemical changes in the skin of patients with melanoma who develop changes in skin pigmentation following immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"7496163"}
