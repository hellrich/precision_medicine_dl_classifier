Among the first oncogenes discovered in cutaneous melanoma was NRAS, which is mutant in up to 20% of tumors causing aberrant signaling in several downstream cascades. Despite, being a highly relevant therapeutic target, design of small molecules selectively inhibiting mutant NRAS in melanoma, to date, remains an unsolved challenge.
