K-P curve, COX univariance and multivariance were used for statistic analysis.\n(1) Electronmicroscopy showed that 40% of squamous cancer and 40% of adenocarcinoma diagnosed microscopically were mixed type. (2) The positive rate of p53 expression increased in advanced stage of NSCLC, and the survival rate was lower in cases with positive p53 expression. (3) A higher survival rate was seen in cases with positive Hras expression. (4) Lower survival rates were seen in cases with abnormal DI and PI. (5) Miscellaneous: expression rates of c-erbB2 and PCNA were related to adenocarcinoma and mixed type electronmicroscopically confirmed respectively.\nFrom this study p53, Hras, DI, PI, c-erbB2 and PCNA were found related to stages, types and survival rates, respectively.","title":"[The clinical significance of biological characters on non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"11263297"}
