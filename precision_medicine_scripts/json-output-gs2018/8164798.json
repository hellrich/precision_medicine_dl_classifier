We report a case of a patient with more than 33 months survival after complete resection of a huge temporal tumor which had metastasized from a lung cancer. A 57-year-old woman presented left hemiparesis and disturbance of consciousness. Magnetic resonance images revealed a huge cystic mass lesion in the right temporal lobe. After a macroscopically complete excision of the tumor, she received radiation therapy (whole brain 50 Gray). She had received lung surgery for the primary lung cancer, 2 years prior to brain metastasis. Histological examination showed papillary tubular adenocarcinoma which was similar to the previously resected lung cancer. Thirty three months after the resection of the intracranial tumor, she has no neurological deficits and no signs of recurrence of either brain tumor or lung tumor. We discuss the size of metastatic brain tumor and the postoperative prognosis of patients with metastatic brain tumor.","title":"[Long survival after removal of a huge brain tumor which had metastasized from a lung cancer: case report].","pubmedId":"8164798"}
