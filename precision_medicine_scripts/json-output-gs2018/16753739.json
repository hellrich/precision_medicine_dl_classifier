All mutations involved a T--\u003eA transversion at the nucleotide 1796. The cases with BRAF mutation were significantly associated with extrathyroidal extension. We also evaluated the expression of AKAP9 protein by immunohistochemistry. The AKAP9 protein was seen as a single perinuclear dot in all the PTCs. Therefore, 58% of the specimens harboured the BRAF mutation and no case had AKAP9-BRAF fusion in the sporadic PTCs.\nOur results suggest that the BRAF mutation can be a useful diagnostic and prognostic marker and a target for exploring novel cancer therapies to treat PTCs. AKAP9-BRAF fusion may be a very rare event in sporadic PTCs.","title":"BRAF mutation and AKAP9 expression in sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas.","pubmedId":"16753739"}
