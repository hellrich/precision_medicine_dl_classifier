Thirty-nine samples were tested with the proposed assay and compared to an APTT-based assay performed using the APC-resistance kit (Chromogenix, MÃ¶lndal, Sweden). In both assays APC was added at the last stage of the reaction together with CaCl2. The response to APC was calculated as a ratio of absorbances (or of clotting times) of a sample tested with or without APC and as the amount of F VIII activity generated in the presence of APC. An APC-ratio less than 2.0 and residual F VIII activity over 55% indicated APC-resistance. The results demonstrated that APC-response was heterogenic and dependent on the assay used for the determination. Only 1/3 of the tested samples were resistant in both APTT-based and in amidolytic assays. A number of samples developed an adequate decrease in F VIII activity, but the APC-resistance was still registered by the APTT-based assay. Other samples had a sufficient APC-response in APTT-based assay, in spite of diminished inactivation of F VIIIa. The obtained data presented the response to APC as a complex process with a chain of reactions. It indicated that poor degradation of coagulation factors may not be sufficient for its development.","title":"Heterogeneity of the APC-resistance phenomenon.","pubmedId":"7997977"}
