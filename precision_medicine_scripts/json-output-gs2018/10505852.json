With regard to therapy trials targeting EGFR, it has been reported that stable transfection of EGFR antisense or treatment with antibody against EGFR results in growth suppression of human cancer cells that express high levels of EGFR. We have designed an adenovirus-expressing antisense EGFR and have investigated its effect on the growth of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo. Following infection with EGFR antisense RNA-expressing adenovirus (Ad-EAS), the cell surface EGFR protein levels of infected cancer cells were markedly reduced, and the in vitro growth of Ad-EAS-infected cells was significantly inhibited relative to control-infected cells in all three gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, KKLS, and MKN28) studied here (P \u003c .0002). In a nude mouse subcutaneous tumor system, in vivo tumor growth of MKN28 was significantly inhibited after Ad-EAS treatment, and inhibition on day 48 was 93% by volume compared with that of untreated controls. These results suggest that an adenoviral vector system targeting the down-regulation of EGFR could be a good candidate for the therapy of gastric cancers that overexpress EGFR.","title":"Antisense epidermal growth factor receptor delivered by adenoviral vector blocks tumor growth in human gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"10505852"}
