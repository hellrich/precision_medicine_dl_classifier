Our results indicate that this test is clinically useful for the diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer in patients with an unsuspected primary prostate malignancy. Further, application of prostatic-specific antigen testing may confirm metastatic prostate cancer in atypical sites in patients with a previously diagnosed prostate malignancy.","title":"Atypical metastasis from prostate cancer.
