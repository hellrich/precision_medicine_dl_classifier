As in the case of classical ALCL, this tumor usually occurs in young patients and shows an excellent response to chemotherapy, but some authors have suggested that in reality this is a nonanaplastic T-cell lymphoma rich in histiocytes. In this paper, we show that three of five cases of lympho-histiocytic ALCL stain with anti-ALK antibodies and can therefore be presumed to express the chimeric NPM/ALK protein secondary to (2;5) translocation. These findings further support the inclusion of this as a type of ALCL and not among the nonanaplastic peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, they indicate that staining for ALK proteins is a powerful tool for the diagnosis of lympho-histiocytic ALCL, the recognition of which may be difficult on morphological grounds.","title":"Frequent expression of the NPM-ALK chimeric fusion protein in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, lympho-histiocytic type.","pubmedId":"9094977"}
