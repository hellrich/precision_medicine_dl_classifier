Immunohistochemistry in combination with FISH is currently the most used method for this detection. The objective of our study was to compare the use of multiparameter DNA flow cytometry (MP-FCM) for this assessment with immunohistochemistry (IHC). For this purpose the number of positive cells as well as the intensity of the immunofluorescence signal as determined by MP-FCM were compared with IHC scores.\nSingle cell suspensions from 110 breast cancers were analysed on a DAKO Galaxy flow cytometer after simultaneous (immuno)labeling for cytokeratin, Her2/neu and DNA (propidium iodide). Next to ploidy and proliferative activity (S-phase fraction), the fraction of Her2/neu-positive epithelial cells was determined. In 25 cases the intensity of the immunofluorescence signal was also determined by MP-FCM in the total cytokeratin+ fraction as well as the cytokeratin+/Her2/neu+fraction. Immunohistochemistry for Her2/neu was done on paraffin sections of all cases using the same polyclonal Her2/neu antibody in a SABC-peroxidase procedure after heat-induced antigen retrieval.\nHer2/neu overexpression as determined by IHC showed a score of 0 in 30%, 1 in 25%, 2 in 26% and 3 in 19% of the cases. There was a good correlation when comparing the fraction of Her2/neu-positive epithelial cells as determined by MP-FCM and semiquantitative IHC scores (r \u003d 0.89, p \u003c 0.0001). No correlation was found between the IHC-Scores and the intensity of the Her2/neu- staining in the total epithelial compartment as measured by MP-FCM. However, when restricting the intensity-determination to the Her2/neu-positive epithelial cells, a significant correlation was found between MP-FCM and IHC scores (r \u003d 0.72, p \u003c 0.0001).\nThe results of the current study show that MP-FCM can be a good alternative for the objective quantification of Her2/neu.","title":"Her2/neu analysis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast carcinomas: comparison of immunohistochemistry and multiparameter DNA flow cytometry.","pubmedId":"12820338"}
