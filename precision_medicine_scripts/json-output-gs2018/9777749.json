MEN 2 is associated with several RET protooncogene mutations. A 61-year-old woman with a family history of RET-positive MTC presented with a solitary thyroid nodule. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was suspicious for neoplasm. Biochemical studies revealed basal hypercalcitoninemia (116 pg/mL [normal \u003c26]) and PHP (serum calcium, 10.9 mg/dL; intact PTH, 113.2 pg/mL [10.0-65.0]). Pheochromocytoma screening was negative. A provisional diagnosis of MEN 2 was made, but at surgery, a single parathyroid adenoma was resected and frozen sections of several lymph nodes revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). A total thyroidectomy was performed. Final histological diagnosis was PTC and parathyroid adenoma with no evidence of MTC. Postoperatively, RET mutation testing was positive. The basal calcitonin (CT) fell to 25 pg/mL, but peaked at 935 (normal \u003c105) after pentagastrin infusion, consistent with occult MTC. After radioiodine ablation, CT decreased further. Octreotide scanning was negative. Faced with PHP, a thyroid nodule, and a family history of MTC, clinicians tend to diagnose MEN 2. This patient had a single parathyroid adenoma and nonmedullary thyroid cancer, which the literature actually suggests to be an association more frequent than MEN 2. Yet, there remains compelling data in favor of occult MTC, leaving open the possibility of an MEN 2 variant with the rare association of PTC.","title":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma, parathyroid adenoma, and unexplained hypercalcitoninemia: an unusual presentation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A?","pubmedId":"9777749"}
