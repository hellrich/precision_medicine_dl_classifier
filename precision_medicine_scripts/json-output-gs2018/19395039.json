Thirty-eight (72%) of the 53 patients had \u003eT3 tumors at presentation. Of the 38 patients with \u003eT3 tumors, 20 were treated with orbital exenteration and postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), 6 were treated with orbital exenteration without RT, and 12 were treated with globe-preserving surgery (10 with RT and 2 without RT). Of the 15 patients with \u003cT3 tumors, 6 were treated with globe-preserving surgery and RT, 2 were treated with globe-preserving surgery without RT, 6 were treated with orbital exenteration with bone removal and RT, and 1 was treated with orbital exenteration with bone removal without RT. Only 1 patient with a \u003cT3 tumor, had local recurrence. Among patients with \u003eT3 tumors, the risk of local recurrence (in the orbit or skull base) was higher in patients treated with conservative surgery as opposed to orbital exenteration and RT. Only 4 (20%) of the 20 patients treated with orbital exenteration and RT had local recurrence, compared with 3 (50%) of the 6 patients treated with orbital exenteration without RT and 8 (67%) of the 12 patients treated with globe-preserving surgery. Overall, 17 (45%) of the 38 patients with \u003eT3 tumors and only 1 (7%) of the 15 patients with \u003cT3 tumors died of disease during the study period.\nIn patients with lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma, AJCC \u003eT3 disease at initial diagnosis correlates with worse outcomes than does AJCC \u003cT3 disease.\nThe author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.","title":"American Joint Committee on Cancer classification predicts outcome of patients with lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"19395039"}
