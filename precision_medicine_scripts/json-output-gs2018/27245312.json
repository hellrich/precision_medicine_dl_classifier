In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving targeted mutant IDH inhibitor therapy, neutrophil recovery within the setting of clinical differentiation syndrome (DS) has been anecdotally described.\nWe describe 3 patients who developed clinically apparent DS during monotherapy with the mutant IDH1 inhibitor, AG-120, for relapsed/refractory AML.\nAG-120-induced differentiation commenced within the first 60 days of treatment, notably in the same time frame as clinical response, strengthening the purported mechanism of targeted mutant IDH inhibitor therapy via successful myeloid maturation. Symptoms of DS were nonspecific and included culture-negative fever, edema, hypotension, malaise, and pleural and/or pericardial effusions, in addition to marked neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis.\nDS can occur during treatment with targeted mutant IDH1 inhibitor therapy. Patients might present with nonspecific clinical manifestations often in the setting of leukocytosis related to exuberant neutrophil recovery. Prompt identification and initiation of treatment interventions, including hydroxyurea, corticosteroids, and/or consideration of temporary treatment discontinuation, are important to facilitate prompt resolution.","title":"Evidence for Clinical Differentiation and Differentiation Syndrome in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia and IDH1 Mutations Treated With the Targeted Mutant IDH1 Inhibitor, AG-120.","pubmedId":"27245312"}
