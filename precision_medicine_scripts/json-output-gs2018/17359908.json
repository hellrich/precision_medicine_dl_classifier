Expression of the platelet-derived growth factor has been shown in HCC, which may derive from hepatic stem cells that express the c-kit proto-oncogene. Because of the promising results of imatinib and the key role played by c-kit in gastrointestinal stromal tumours and other solid tumours, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of c-kit (CD117) overexpression in patients with HCC.\nA retrospective study of 258 archival specimens of subjects with histologically confirmed HCC was carried out. Expression of the c-kit proto-oncogene was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using rabbit anti-CD117 antibody A4502.\nThe overall percentage of positive immunohistochemical staining of HCCs was 2.3% (6/258).\nOur results suggest that CD117 is not significantly overexpressed in HCC and there seems to be no role for the use of imatinib.","title":"CD117 (c-kit) expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17359908"}
