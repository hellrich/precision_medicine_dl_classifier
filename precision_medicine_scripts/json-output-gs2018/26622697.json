EGFR gene siRNAs (EGFR-siRNA) were introduced into esophageal cancer Eca109 cells using LipofectamineÂ® 2000. The EGFR messenger (m)RNA expression levels, EGFR protein expression and cell growth were assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, western blot analysis and a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), respectively. In addition, colony assays were used to determine the inhibitory effects of X-ray radiation on EGFR-silenced cells. EGFR mRNA and protein levels were reduced in the Eca109 cells transfected with EGFR-siRNA. The relative EGFR mRNA expression levels were reduced to 26.74, 9.52 and 4.61% in Eca109 cells transfected with EGFR-siRNA1, 2 and 3, respectively. These mRNA levels were significantly reduced compared with the those of the control group (42.44%; P\u003c0.0001). Transfection with siRNA3 resulted in the greatest reduction in EGFR mRNA expression, with an inhibition rate of 85%. The relative EGFR protein expression levels were reduced to 24.05, 34.91 and 34.14% in Eca109 cells transfected with EGFR-siRNA1, 2 and 3, respectively. These protein levels were significantly reduced compared with those of the control group (78.57%; P\u003c0.0001). Transfection with siRNA1 resulted in the greatest reduction in EGFR protein expression, with an inhibition rate of 72.84%. This reduction in EGFR expression inhibited the proliferation of Eca109 cells, which was identified using the CCK-8 assay. The proliferation inhibition ratio was 28.2%. The cells treated with irradiation in addition to EGFR-siRNA, demonstrated reduced radiobiological parameters (D0, Dq and SF2) compared with those of cells treated with irradiation only, with a sensitization enhancing ratio of 1.5. In conclusion, suppression of EGFR expression may enhance the radiosensitivity of esophageal cancer Eca109 cells and therefore may represent a promising approach for future clinical practice.","title":"RNA interference for epidermal growth factor receptor enhances the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line Eca109.","pubmedId":"26622697"}
