Histamine, released from enterochromaffin-like cells stimulates the parietal cell directly via H-2 receptors coupled to generation of cAMP. Gastrin, acting via cholecystokinin-2 receptors on enterochromaffin-like cells coupled to an increase in intracellular calcium, stimulates the parietal cell indirectly by activating histidine decarboxylase, releasing histamine, and inducing enterochromaffin-like cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Acetylcholine, released from gastric postganglionic intramural neurons, stimulates the parietal cell directly via M-3 receptors coupled to intracellular calcium release and calcium entry. The second-messenger systems activated in the parietal cell converge on H+ K+-ATPase that catalyzes the exchange of luminal K+ for cytoplasmic H+ and is responsible for gastric luminal acidification. The main inhibitor of acid secretion is somatostatin which, acting via sst2 receptors, exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on parietal, enterochromaffin-like, and gastrin cells. Acute infection with Helicobacter pylori results in hypochlorhydria, whereas chronic infection may be associated with either hypo- or hyperchlorhydria. Although prostaglandins are thought to play a physiologic role in the regulation of acid secretion and maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity, the precise roles of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 in these processes still eludes us.","title":"Gastric secretion.","pubmedId":"17031207"}
