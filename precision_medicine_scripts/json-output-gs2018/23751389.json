It is a malignancy derived from embryonic neural crest cells of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system that demonstrates remarkably heterogenous clinical and biological behavior ranging from spontaneous regression to inexorable progression with fatal outcomes. Various imaging modalities, including plain radiograph, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, bone scintigraphy, metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy, and positron emission tomography/CT have been used to diagnose primary and metastatic neuroblastoma. In this article, we review the application of various imaging modalities to better define and recognize their role in the diagnosis and follow-up of neuroblastoma.","title":"Application of imaging modalities for evaluating neuroblastoma.","pubmedId":"23751389"}
