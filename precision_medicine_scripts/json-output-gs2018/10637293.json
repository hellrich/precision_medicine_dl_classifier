Ret kinases are constitutively activated as a result of MEN2A mutations (Ret-MEN2A) or MEN2B mutations (Ret-MEN2B). Here we demonstrate that UV light (UV) irradiation induces superactivation of the constitutively activated Ret-MEN2A and Ret-MEN2B as well as activation of c-Ret. Before UV irradiation, small percentages of c-Ret (3-4%) and Ret-MEN2B (1-2%) and large percentages of Ret-MEN2A (30-40%) were dimerized through disulfide bonds. These dimerized Ret proteins were preferentially autophosphorylated, suggesting a close relation between up-regulated kinase activity and disulfide bond-mediated dimerization of Ret proteins. We found that UV irradiation promotes the disulfide bond-mediated dimerization of the Ret proteins, in close association with activation and superactivation of Ret kinases. UV irradiation also induced dimerization and activation of the extracellular domain-deleted mutant Ret (Ret-PTC-1). Interestingly, the levels of basic kinase activity and dimerization of Ret-PTC-1-C376A, in which cysteine 376 in the tyrosine kinase domain of Ret-PTC-1 was replaced by alanine, were low and were not increased by UV irradiation. These results suggest that Ret-PTC-1 cysteine 376 is one of possibly multiple critical target amino acids of UV for Ret kinase activation. Overexpression of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase in cells as a result of gene transfection prevented both the UV-mediated promotion of dimerization and the superactivation of Ret-MEN2A kinase. These results suggest that the UV-induced free radicals in cells attack intracellular domains of Ret to dimerize the kinase proteins for superactivation.","title":"Ultraviolet light induces redox reaction-mediated dimerization and superactivation of oncogenic Ret tyrosine kinases.","pubmedId":"10637293"}
