This study was to explore the expression of AR and its relationship with clinicopathologic parameters in triple negative breast cancer (negative estrogen receptor, negative progesterone receptor, and negative Her-2).\nImmunohistochemical assays were performed to determine the expression of AR in 137 cases of triple negative breast cancer and 132 cases of non-triple negative breast cancer. The relationships between AR expression and clinicopathologic data and prognosis were analyzed.\nThe positive rate of AR was significantly lower in triple negative breast cancer than in non-triple negative breast (27.7% vs. 83.3%, Chi2\u003d83.963, P\u003c0.001). AR expression was correlated with menorrheal status (Chi2\u003d6.803, P\u003d0.009), tumor grade (Chi2\u003d5.173, P\u003d0.023), node status (Chi2\u003d7.787, P\u003d0.005), 5-year disease-free survival (Chi2\u003d5.012, P\u003d0.025) and 5-year overall survival (Chi2\u003d5.552, P\u003d0.018) in triple negative breast cancer, but was not correlated with clinicopathologic parameters and survival in non-triple negative breast cancer. The 5-year overall survival rate was 78.8% in triple negative breast cancer and 83.3% in non-triple negative breast cancer.\nThe expression of AR is related to biological behaviors of triple negative breast cancer, and plays a role in endocrinotherapy and prognostic prediction.","title":"Expression and clinical significance of androgen receptor in triple negative breast cancer.","pubmedId":"20507730"}
