Despite careful evaluation, it is often impossible to identify the exact physiologic cause of an effusion and difficult to identify a pragmatic course of therapy. Aggressive management including chest tube drainage, with or without instillation of inflammation-inducing drugs, and radiotherapy or surgery in selected cases is indicated for palliative treatment and probably for increased survival. In formulating a treatment plan, attention should be given to a variety of factors including pathogenic forces in the formation of malignant pleural effusion, tissue type of the metastatic malignancy, general clinical status of the patient, the presence of pleural loculations and adhesions, and the exclusion of other non-malignant causes of pleural effusion.","title":"Malignant pleural effusions.","pubmedId":"367592"}
