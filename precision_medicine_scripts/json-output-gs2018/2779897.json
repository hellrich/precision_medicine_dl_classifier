Mortality data from the National Health Statistics Centre for the period 1977-85 were used in the analysis. The definition of an avoidable death was based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code using established criteria. Eight percent of deaths of people under 65 years of age met the criteria. The basic spatial entity for the analysis is the census area unit and maps of Auckland are presented to show the distribution of avoidable mortality. It is found that there are significant and consistent spatial variations. Three areas with avoidable mortality that is generally higher than elsewhere are apparent: in south Auckland; to the north-west of the central urban sector centered on Grey Lynn; and in the eastern parts of the central sector from Glenn Innes to Onehunga.","title":"Area variation of avoidable causes of death in Auckland, 1977-85.","pubmedId":"2779897"}
