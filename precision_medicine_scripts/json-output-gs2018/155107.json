The tumor, covering 3/4 of the cornea, had a lobulated appearance, pinkish colour with vascularization and pigment granules, in a few places. The limbal area was free of tumor. Histologic examination indicated that the melanoma was primary, of the epithelioid type, with a few areas of spindle type cells.","title":"[Primary malignant melanoma of the cornea (author\u0027s transl)].","pubmedId":"155107"}
