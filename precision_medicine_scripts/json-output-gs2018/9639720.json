EGFR was negative in all 20 normal laryngeal mucosa specimens, and it was positive in 44 of 60 laryngeal carcinoma specimens. The expression of EGFR did not correlate with tumor location, tumor stage and lymph node metastasis, but correlated significantly with histological grading and the survival rate. A significantly higher positive rate was found in poorly differentiated than in moderately well differentiated tumors. The 3-year survival rate in patients with expression of EGFR was much lower than those with negative results (P \u003c 0.01). The results suggest that EGFR may play an important role in the process of carcinogenesis in laryngeal mucosa and be used as a useful marker for the assessment of biological behavior and prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma.","title":"[Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in laryngeal cancer].","pubmedId":"9639720"}
