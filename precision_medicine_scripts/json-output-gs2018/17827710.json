Inactivation of PTEN by loss-of-function mutations gives rise to deregulated hyperproliferation of cells, leading to oncogenic transformation. Recent studies have identified a number of upstream regulatory factors for PTEN and unveiled that the impairment in the PTEN regulatory system potentially becomes a causal factor for oncogenic transformation of cells. This article will review the PTEN inactivation mechanism which is linked to human tumorigenesis, particularly focusing on recent research progress in PTEN regulators.","title":"PTEN: its deregulation and tumorigenesis.","pubmedId":"17827710"}
