No evidence currently exists about its role in determining sensitivity/resistance to BRAF inhibitors, utilized in the treatment of patients carrying BRAF V600 mutations, and to chemotherapy. The newly established metastatic melanoma (MM) cell line MO-1 was characterized for its sensitivity to vemurafenib and nab-paclitaxel, both already utilized for the treatment of MM.\nAll analyses were carried out by comparing results with those found in MM cells wild type for BRAF or mutated in V600. In addition, cellular effectors were investigated by ELISA kits, western blotting and flow cytometry.\nThe exposure to vemurafenib inhibited MO-1 cell proliferation at concentrations similar to those obtained in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma models, and an explanation of this sensitivity is the strong activation of Erk1/2 and the low expression of MITF. Nab-paclitaxel strongly reduced proliferation of MO-1 cells perhaps for the very low expression level of PMEL17, transcriptionally regulated by MITF and negatively involved in determining sensitivity to taxanes.\nThus, the mutation BRAF G469A in MM might be related to a weak effectiveness of therapy with BRAF inhibitors and a promising therapeutic approach may be with nab-paclitaxel.","title":"Metastatic melanoma cells with BRAF G469A mutation: nab-paclitaxel better than vemurafenib?","pubmedId":"26070258"}
