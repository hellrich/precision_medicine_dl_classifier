Whereas the BRAFi dabrafenib induces cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and verrucal keratosis, the MEKi trametinib frequently induces acneiform eruptions that are reversible after drug discontinuation. Furthermore, when dabrafenib and trametinib are used in combination, there are fewer cutaneous toxicities. We report a patient with BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma treated with the BRAFi/MEKi combination therapy who developed an acneiform eruption after treatment discontinuation rather than during active therapy. Moreover, the eruption resolved when the combination treatment was reintroduced and recurred after increasing the dose of trametinib. The eruption may be explained by the longer half-life of trametinib (4.5 days) compared with dabrafenib (5.2â€‰h). This is the first case reported with this particular side effect induced after stopping the treatment and could become more frequent as the BRAFi/MEKi combination of drugs is more frequently prescribed.","title":"Acneiform eruption in a patient with metastatic melanoma after ceasing combination dabrafenib/trametinib therapy.","pubmedId":"24922191"}
