We describe an unusual eyebrow subcutis mass in a 65-year-old female.\nA 65-year-old female presented with an 8- to 9-month history of a painless swelling over the right eyebrow that was sausage-shaped. The clinical differential diagnosis included neurofibroma/schwannoma, cyst, prolapsed fat or metastasis. The lesion was excised.\nThe histology revealed a lesion composed of rope-like collagen, some spindle cells, mature adipocytes and hyperchromatic multi-nucleate floret cells. The spindle and multi-nucleate floret cells showed immunohistochemical positivity for CD34. The features were of a primary pleomorphic lipoma.\nThis is the first reported case of a pleomorphic lipoma of the eyebrow subcutis. We discuss the clinical and histological differential diagnosis, especially related to histological conditions with which pleomorphic lipoma can be confused, such as well-differentiated liposarcoma.","title":"Unilateral Pleomorphic Lipoma of the Eyebrow.","pubmedId":"27172296"}
