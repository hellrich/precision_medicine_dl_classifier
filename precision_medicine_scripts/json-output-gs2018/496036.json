There was only a weak negative correlation between hPRL and testosterone in oligozoospermic men. No correlation was found between hPRL and hLH, hFSH, sperm count and sperm motility. Nevertheless measurement of hPRL should be performed in all cases with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, loss of libido or impotence since these symptoms may be signs of a prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma.","title":"Serum prolactin in male infertility.","pubmedId":"496036"}
