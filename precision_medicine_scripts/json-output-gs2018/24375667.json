HPV infection was evaluated using p16 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), high-risk HPV DNA by in situ hybridization (ISH), and HPV genotyping by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enzyme immunoassay (EIA).\nEleven patients were identified: 5 with synchronous and 6 with metachronous HPV-positive second primary tumors, the latter demonstrating a mean time interval of 5 years. There were 13 second primary tumors: 11 oropharyngeal, 1 nasopharyngeal, and 1 floor of the mouth. Nine of 10 genotyped patients harbored HPV-16, and 1 patient had HPV-33 in 3 synchronous tumors.\nHPV-associated second primary tumors may present as synchronous and/or metachronous lesions and can arise outside the oropharynx after prolonged intervals. Further work is necessary to identify patients at risk and to elucidate the mechanisms of HPV-associated head and neck second primary tumors.","title":"Multicentric human papillomavirus-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24375667"}
