We aimed to evaluate the presence of PDL1/2 gene cluster copy number gains in NSCLC by FISH and correlate these data to PDL1 IHC levels in adenocarcinomas (AC). Methods: We investigated 107 AC and 78 squamous cell carcinomas (SQCLC) for PDL1/2 FISH. Furthermore, AC were analyzed by IHC with the clone 28-8 stained on a DAKO platform. Cut-off level was 1% (  5% highly positive). FISH was carried out with the ZytoLight SPEC CD274,PDCD1LG2/CEN 9 Dual Color Probe. The FISH evaluation criteria included CD274,PDCD1LG2/CEN 9 ratio as well as average gene copy numbers, proportions of tumor cells with  4 PDL1/2 and  5 PDL1/2 signals as well as gene clusters. Results: 28/178 (16%) of NSCLC were FISH positive, 39% (11/28) thereof fulfilled the criteria for high level PDL1/2 amplification (PDL1,2/CEN9 ratio  2.0 or average gene copy number per cell  6.0 or  10% of tumor cells containing  15 gene signals), 4% (1/28) for intermediate level copy number gain (  50% of cells containing  5 gene signals) and 57% (16/28) for low level copy number gain (  40% of tumor cells with  4 PDL1/2 signals). Overall PDL1/2 amplifications occur at almost equal frequencies in AC and SQCLC, 18% and 13% respectively, but high level amplifications are more often seen in SQCLC (7/78 vs. 4/107 in AC). FISH results were independent of KRAS, EGFR,ALK, ROS1 or MET status. 35/107 AC (33%) were PDL1 IHC positive (28 high, 7 low positivity). The correlation between IHC and FISH was statistically significant (Chi square: p \u003c 0.001). 15/18 of FISH positive AC were IHC positive (vs. 3/66 IHC negatives). 75% (3/4) high level amplified AC were highly IHC positive. Conclusions:PDL1/2 gene copy number gains occur in AC and SQCLC, but high level amplifications are more frequent in SQCLC. PDL1/2 gains seem to be associated with PDL1 overexpression in a subset of AC. PDL1/2 FISH could contribute to our understanding of PDL1 expression and could therefore be a valuable adjunct biomarker in upcoming trials with PD1/PDL1 inhibitors.","title":"Occurrence of PDL1/2 copy number gains detected by FISH in adeno and squamous cell carcinomas of the lung and association with PDL1 overexpression in adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"ASCO_167588-176"}
