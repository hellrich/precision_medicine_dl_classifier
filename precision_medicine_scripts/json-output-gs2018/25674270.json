CD271-expressing melanoma cells in murine xenografts give rise to metastatic tumor. However, a comprehensive clinical investigation of its role in different stages of melanomagenesis has not been well studied. We studied CD271 expression with immunohistochemistry in 11 cases of banal melanocytic nevus, 9 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma, 10 cases of primary mucosal melanoma, 5 cases of metastatic melanoma in regional lymph nodes, and 11 cases of metastatic melanoma in the brain. In addition, 9 cases of metastatic, high-grade adenocarcinomas from breast and lung to the brain were studied as controls. The staining was scored based on the number of positive cells and analyzed by student t-test. All banal melanocytic nevi showed negative to equivocal staining. Primary cutaneous melanomas showed variable patterns, mucosal melanomas were mostly negative, and metastases to lymph nodes ranged from negative to moderate positivity. In contrast, all 11 cases of metastatic melanoma to the brain showed moderate (4 cases) to strong positivity (7 cases). Metastases from lung and breast origin were used as controls and showed negative to weakly positive staining in all but one case. Statistically, CD271 has significantly increased expression in metastatic melanoma to the brain when compared to the other groups studied (P \u003c 0.05). The findings suggest that CD271 expression is specifically increased in metastatic melanoma to the brain. Further prospective study for the role of CD271 in prediction of melanoma brain metastasis as well as prognosis assessment will be of great clinical significance.
