BCC has been associated with UV-induced mutations of the PTC and p53 tumor suppressor genes, and to polymorphisms in the melanocortin-1 receptor and XPD genes. Mortality rates due to BCC are low, but its increasing incidence and prolonged morbidity means the disease is costly to treat. Early recognition and effective treatment are therefore important, to reduce the incidence of BCC and lighten the economic burden of its management. This paper reviews current treatments for BCC, including excision and curettage, electrodessication, surgery, cryosurgery, radiotherapy, and treatment with 5-fluorouracil and intralesional/perilesional cytokines. It also deals with two new treatment modalities, photodynamic therapy and imiquimod 5% cream, an immune response modifier that effectively resolves BCC lesions.","title":"New treatment modalities for basal cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"12079222"}
