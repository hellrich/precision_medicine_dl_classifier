Specifically, we asked to what extent the pigmentary and invasive behaviour of both cells is influenced by their interaction with adjacent skin cells (keratinocytes and fibroblasts) and the basement membrane (BM). In the presence of a BM, normal human melanocytes within this model remained within the basal layer of keratinocytes and did not pigment spontaneously. When the BM was removed, melanocytes were found suprabasally and pigmented extensively. No significant invasion of melanocytes into the dermis was detected in the presence or absence of the BM. HBL melanoma cells showed no significant ability to invade into the dermis in the absence of other cells, irrespective of the presence or absence of the BM. However, when added to keratinocytes and fibroblasts, HBL cells showed a capacity to invade into the dermis, both in the presence and absence of the BM. Associated with HBL invasion into the dermis, we noted significant keratinocyte entry into the dermis. On their own, keratinocytes entered the dermis in the absence of the BM but showed no significant penetration into the dermis when the BM was present. In summary, this model demonstrates clear differences between melanocytes and a melanoma cell line with respect to their invasive properties. It also allows demonstration of interactions between cells, and between cells and the BM. The study also provides evidence for a synergistic interaction between this melanoma cell line and keratinocytes in penetrating the BM.","title":"Characterization of an in vitro model of human melanoma invasion based on reconstructed human skin.","pubmedId":"10730751"}
