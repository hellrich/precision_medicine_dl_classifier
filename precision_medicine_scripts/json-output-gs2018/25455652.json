We thus conducted a cohort study evaluating the influence of statin use on survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).\nWe identified 1562 patients diagnosed with GBM during 2000-2009 from the Danish Cancer Registry and linked this cohort to Danish nationwide demographic and health registries. Within the GBM cohort, each patient recorded as using statins prior to diagnosis (defined as ≥ 2 redeemed prescriptions) was matched to two statin non-users (\u003c2 redeemed prescriptions) by propensity scores based on age, gender, year of diagnosis, comorbidity, and use of selected drugs. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all-cause death associated with prediagnostic statin use.\nA total of 339 GBM patients were included in the analyses. Of these, 325 died during median follow-up of 6.9 months (interquartile range: 3.8-13.4 months). Prediagnostic statin use was associated with a reduced HR of death (0.79; 95% CI: 0.63-1.00). The HRs decreased with increasing duration or intensity of prediagnostic statin use [long-term (≥ 5 years) statin use: HR 0.75 (95% CI: 0.47-1.20); high-intensity statin use: HR 0.66 (95% CI: 0.44-0.98)]. Additional adjustment for oncotherapeutic modalities yielded similar results (overall HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.63-1.01).\nLong-term prediagnostic statin use may improve survival following GBM.","title":"Statin use and survival following glioblastoma multiforme.","pubmedId":"25455652"}
