In the mouse, FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) is expressed in an appropriate spatial and temporal manner to be orchestrating these functions. Mouse embryos homozygous for a mutated Fgfr1 allele (fgfr1(delta tmk)) die early in development, show abnormal growth and aberrant mesodermal patterning. We have performed a chimeric analysis to further study FGFR1 function in the morphogenesis and patterning of the mesodermal germ layer at gastrulation. At E9.5, fgfr1(delta tmk)/fgfr1(delta tmk) cells showed a marked deficiency in their ability to contribute to the extra-embryonic, cephalic, heart, axial and paraxial mesoderm, and to the endoderm of chimeric embryos. Analysis at earlier stages of development revealed that fgfr1(delta tmk)/fgfr1(delta tmk) cells accumulated within the primitive streak of chimeric embryos, and consequently failed to populate the anterior mesoderm and endodermal lineages at their inception. We suggest that the primary defect associated with the fgfr1(delta tmk) mutation is a deficiency in the ability of epiblast cells to traverse the primitive streak. fgfr1(delta tmk)/fgfr1(delta tmk) cells that accumulated within the primitive streak of chimeric embryos tended to form secondary neural tubes. These secondary neural tubes were entirely fgfr1(delta tmk)/fgfr1(delta tmk) cell derived. The adoption of ectopic neural fate suggests that normal morphogenetic movement through the streak is essential not only for proper mesodermal patterning but also for correct determination of mesodermal/neurectodermal cell fates.","title":"Chimeric analysis of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (Fgfr1) function: a role for FGFR1 in morphogenetic movement through the primitive streak.","pubmedId":"9226454"}
