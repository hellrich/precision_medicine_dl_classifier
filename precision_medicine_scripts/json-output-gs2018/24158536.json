Patients with metastatic disease, incomplete staging information, and those who did not receive surgery or radiation were excluded.\nPatients had been treated with surgery, radiation, or both.\nDistribution of patient characteristics between patients of each histology. Hazard ratios, 3-year overall survival, subgroup, and multivariate analysis of patient and treatment characteristics were investigated.\nAcross each cohort, patients with BSCC more often had high-grade tumors and treatment with lymph node dissection. Multivariate analysis found that group stage, T stage, N stage, size, lymph node dissection, and age statistically significantly influenced overall survival. In multivariate analysis, the hazard ratio for death for patients with BSCC in the oral cavity and larynx and hypopharynx was not statistically significantly different from that for SCC. In the oropharynx, the hazard ratio for death for BSCC histology compared with SCC histology was 0.73 (P \u003d .03).\nCompared with SCC, BSCC is not an independent adverse prognostic factor for patients with head and neck cancer. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results analysis has limits, including lack of information regarding chemotherapy, but after controlling for disease and treatment variables, including neck dissection and radiotherapy, BSCC histology did not have an independent adverse prognostic effect on overall survival. The reported association between human papillomavirus and BSCC histology may explain the lower hazard ratio for death in patients with oropharynx BSCC.","title":"Prognostic significance of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma in head and neck cancer.","pubmedId":"24158536"}
