Preoperative chemotherapy, followed by the pathological assessment of tumour response to treatment provide optimal conditions for the evaluation of the predictive value of biological parameters. We report here data on the predictive value of ERBB2 in a series of 54 cases of breast cancer treated by preoperative high-dose anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Our series consisted of 26 women presenting an inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and of 28 women with poor prognosis primary cancer (PPPC). Patients received a total of four cycles with doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2) for IBC or 70 mg/m(2) for PPPC) and cyclophosphamide (6 g/m(2) for IBC or 1400 mg/m(2) for PPPC), every 21 days. ERBB2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry (clone CB11) performed on a tumour biopsy taken before chemotherapy. All patients underwent surgery as a second step of treatment, and the tumour response was assessed on pathological specimens. A complete pathological response was observed in 24 of the 54 cases (44%) (95% confidence interval (CI), 31-57). Pathological complete response was positively correlated with high histological grade (P\u003d0. 02) and with the absence of oestrogen (P\u003d0.003) or progesterone (P\u003d0. 02) receptor expression. ERBB2 overexpression was found in 18 of the 54 cases (33%). A complete pathological response was observed in 33% of these cases (6/18). This figure was not significantly different from the 50% rate of complete response observed for tumours with no detectable ERBB2 expression (18/36). In this small series, ERBB2 overexpression was not a significant predictive marker of the pathological response to high-dose doxorubicin-based chemotherapy.","title":"ERBB2 overexpression in breast carcinomas: no positive correlation with complete pathological response to preoperative high-dose anthracycline-based chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"10738122"}
