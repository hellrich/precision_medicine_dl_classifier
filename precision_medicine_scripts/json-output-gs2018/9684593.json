The diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary carcinoma (DSV), the oxyphilic variant of Hashimoto thyroiditis (OHT) and primary lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (PLT), the FNA appearances of which have many similarities, belong to the same category.\nA case of WLT occurred in a 31-year-old female, who was admitted with a 1.5-cm, nodular lesion of the thyroid; fine needle aspiration (FNA) yielded a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma. Histologic examination revealed the characteristic picture of WLT, with papillae lined with large, oxyphilic thyreocytes, with nuclear pseudoinclusions and grooves filled with lymphocytes, mostly mature plasma cells. The FNA picture of WLT was compared with those of the other lymphocyticrich lesions of the thyroid--DSV, OHT and PLT.\nThe differences between these forms provide diagnostic criteria that could be useful for the preoperative management of patients affected by suspicious, inflammation like thyroid lesions.","title":"Fine needle aspiration of a warthin-like thyroid tumor.
