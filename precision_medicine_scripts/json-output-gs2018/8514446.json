The mRNA expression of the trk gene was detected in 67.4% of cases, with increased frequency in I, II and IVs Evans\u0027 stages and in patients with favorable prognosis according to the Shimada classification. Moreover, trk expression inversely correlated with Nmyc-gene amplification. ret mRNA was found in 36.8% of cases and equally distributed in the different stages. In addition, ngfR (low-affinity NGF receptor)-gene expression was present in 9 out of 25 cases. The simultaneous presence of mRNA related to both forms of the NGF receptor, while not proving the presence of a functional receptor, indicates the existence of a sub-set of neuroblastoma cells potentially responsive to NGF.","title":"trk and ret proto-oncogene expression in human neuroblastoma specimens: high frequency of trk expression in non-advanced stages.","pubmedId":"8514446"}
