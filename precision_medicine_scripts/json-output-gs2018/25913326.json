However, a significant proportion of patients does not achieve the optimal response or are resistant to TKI. ABL1 kinase domain mutations have been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of TKI resistance. Although deletion or insertion of nucleotides in BCR-ABL1 has rarely been described, we identified a CML patient with an already described 35 nucleotides insertion (BCR-ABL1(35INS)) of controversial significance, that confers resistance to imatinib but sensitivity to dasatinib.","title":"A thirty-five nucleotides BCR-ABL1 insertion mutation of controversial significance confers resistance to imatinib in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).","pubmedId":"25913326"}
