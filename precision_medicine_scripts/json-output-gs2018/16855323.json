The presenting manifastations include weakness, weight loss, nausea, melena and anaemia. The present case refers to a 65 years old female patient with a GIST of the ampulla of Vater presenting with obstructive jaundice. Diagnosis was achieved pre-operatively by biopsies collected through diagnostic ERCP. The tumour was locally excised, with preservation of the ampulla. The histological analysis suggested low grade GIST positive for both CD 117 (c-kit) and CD34. Two years after the surgery the patient remains free of disease. Malignant GIST of the ampulla of the Vater is extremely rare as only few similar cases have been described in the literature. This is the first time a GIST being presented as obstructive jaundice ever reported. Despite the unavailability of EUS-FNA, the diagnosis was set preoperatively and the tumor was resected.","title":"Malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the ampulla of Vater presenting with obstructive jaundice.","pubmedId":"16855323"}
