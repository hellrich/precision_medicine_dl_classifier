The development of innovative therapies with improved efficacy is critical to treatment of this disease. Here, we show that aberrant expression of two proteins, p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), is associated with poor patient survival. Using tissue microarray analysis, we found that patients exhibiting both weak PUMA expression and strong p-Akt expression in their melanoma tumor tissue had significantly worse 5-year survival than patients with either weak PUMA or strong p-Akt expression alone (P \u003c 0.001). Strikingly, no patients exhibiting strong PUMA expression and weak p-Akt expression in primary tumor tissue died within 5 years of diagnosis. We propose a two-pronged therapeutic strategy of (a) boosting PUMA expression and (b) inhibiting Akt phosphorylation in melanoma tumor tissue. Here, we report that a recombinant adenovirus containing human PUMA cDNA (ad-PUMA) efficiently inhibits human melanoma cell survival in vitro, rapidly induces apoptosis, and dramatically suppresses human melanoma tumor growth in a severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft model. In melanoma cells strongly expressing p-Akt, we show that Akt/protein kinase B signaling inhibitor-2 (API-2; a small-molecule Akt inhibitor) reduces cell survival in a dose- and time-dependent manner and enhances ad-PUMA-mediated growth inhibition of melanoma cells. Finally, we show that, by combining ad-PUMA and API-2 treatments, human melanoma tumor growth can be inhibited by \u003e80% in vivo compared with controls. Our results suggest that a strategy to correct dysregulated PUMA and p-Akt expression in malignant melanoma may be an effective therapeutic option.","title":"Role of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis and phosphorylated Akt in melanoma cell growth, apoptosis, and patient survival.","pubmedId":"16982766"}
