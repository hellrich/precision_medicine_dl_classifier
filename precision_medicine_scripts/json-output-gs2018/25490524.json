The quantitative values of TP53-ctDNA during the clinical course were compared with the tumour status.\nThree out of ten patients with TP53 mutations in primary tumours showed detectable TP53 mutation levels in preoperative cfDNA. Although the cfDNA concentrations were not always reflective of the disease course, the ctDNA fraction correlated with the disease status.\nctDNA may serve as a useful biomarker to monitor gastric cancer progression and residual disease.","title":"Monitoring gastric cancer progression with circulating tumour DNA.","pubmedId":"25490524"}
