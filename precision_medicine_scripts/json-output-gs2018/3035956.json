Leukemic cells of seven with acute myelomonocytic leukemia and one with acute monocytic leukemia produced various amounts of O2- (0.13-0.87 nmol/min/10(6) cells) when stimulated with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Other types of leukemia cells exhibited no such functions. Leukemic cells of two patients diagnosed as unusual cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia generated significant amounts of O2- when stimulated with WGA and PMA. Both patients went into complete remission while on acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia treatment. Thus O2- generating activity can serve as a functional marker of leukemic cells in myelomonocytic lineage.","title":"Superoxide generation of leukemic cells in children.","pubmedId":"3035956"}
