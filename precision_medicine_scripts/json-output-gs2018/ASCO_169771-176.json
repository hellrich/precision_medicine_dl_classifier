The purpose of this study was to identify clinical features or blood biomarkers capable of predicting ipilimumab related toxicity. Methods: Weperformed a prospective study aimed to analyze potential clinical or biological markers associated with toxicity. The following prospectively collected data were utilized: patient characteristics, previous therapies and level of serum biomarkers (lactic dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, 2-microglobulin, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, S-100, alkaline phosphatase, transaminases, leukocyte count, lymphocyte subpopulations). Logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis of data from 140 consecutive metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab (3mg/kg, q3w) at Veneto Institute of Oncology. Results: Out of 140 patients, 36 (26%) experienced a severe adverse event, 33 (24%) discontinued treatment for severe toxicity. Sex female (OR \u003d 1.5, 95% CI 1.06-2.16 p \u003d .022) and low baseline interleukin-6 serum levels (OR \u003d 2.84, 95% CI 1.34-6.03, p \u003d .007) had a significant and independent association with immune related adverse events. Conclusions: Sex and baseline IL6 serum levels were significantly and independently associated with higher risk of severe toxicity and could be exploited in clinical practice to personalize toxicity surveillance in these patients.","title":"Correlates of toxicity in metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab.","pubmedId":"ASCO_169771-176"}
