This study was designed to test whether c-erb-B2 overexpression can be related to prognosis of patients with metastatic gastric cancer.\nBetween 2005 and 2010, 46 cases of metastatic gastric cancer were evaluated immunohistochemically for c-erb-B2 overexpression. Overall survival (OS) and time-to-progression (TTP) served as the main outcome measures.\nc-erbB2 was overexpressed in 19 (41.3 %) cases and 8 patients (17.4 %) had a c-erbB2 score of 3+ (a strong complete membrane staining observed in \u003e10 % of the tumor cells). c-erbB2 expression was not associated with the clinicohistological characteristics of the study participants. The mean OS was 11.48 ± 1.03 months, whereas the mean TTP was 8.28 ± 0.8 months. Compared with patients with a score of 2+ or less (n \u003d 38), those with a c-erbB2 score of 3+ (n \u003d 8) had both a significantly lower OS (15.55 ± 1.63 vs. 8.22 ± 0.88 months, respectively, p \u003c 0.05) and TTP (10.72 ± 1.81 vs. 6.11 ± 0.61 months, respectively, p \u003c 0.05). After allowance for potential confounders, Cox regression analysis identified a c-erbB2 score of 3+ as an independent predictor of both OS (hazard ratio \u003d 1.9; 95 % confidence interval \u003d 1.1-3.7, p \u003c 0.05) and TTP (hazard ratio \u003d 1.8; 95 % confidence interval \u003d 1.1-4.1, p \u003c 0.05).\nOur results suggest that c-erbB-2 overexpression may have a prognostic significance in patients with metastatic gastric cancer.","title":"Prognostic significance of c-erbB2 overexpression in patients with metastatic gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"22911549"}
