After u.v. treatment, plasmid survival was lower and mutation frequency higher with the XP-A cells mirroring the survival and mutagenesis of the host cells. The nature of the mutations in the suppressor tRNA marker gene was determined by direct sequence analysis. The G.C to A.T transition was the dominant (85%) base substitution mutation with the XP lymphoblasts and was the major (56%) base substitution mutation with the repair-proficient lymphoblasts. We found a G.C to A.T transition mutational hotspot with the XP lymphoblasts not seen in our previous experiments with fibroblasts from the same patient. Comparison of the data presented here with our results with DNA repair-deficient and DNA repair-proficient fibroblasts suggests that hotspot variability is not due to genetic polymorphism or repair capacity of the cells. Instead it appears that cellular factors can influence the probability of mutagenesis of modified DNA at particular sites.","title":"Mutational hotspot variability in an ultraviolet-treated shuttle vector plasmid propagated in xeroderma pigmentosum and normal human lymphoblasts and fibroblasts.","pubmedId":"2182882"}
