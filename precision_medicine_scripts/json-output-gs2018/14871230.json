Histology of all metastases revealed extensive central necrosis and hemorrhage with a demarcating granulomatous reaction imitating angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma but no obvious melanoma tissue. Although extensive immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural examination failed to solve the quandary, careful macroscopy revealed tiny foci of remnants from melanoma in the granulation center. The female developed multiple soft tissue metastases managed by surgery, immunochemotherapy, and autologous vaccination. Both patients are well without internal manifestations 9 and 5 years, respectively, after the first metastatic episode.","title":"Angiomatoid metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"14871230"}
