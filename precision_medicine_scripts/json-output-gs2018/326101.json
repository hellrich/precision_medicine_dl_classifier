During the treatment period the majority of patients had significant relief of symptoms as compared with the placebo period. Most prominent improvement occurred with the symptoms of nasal stuffiness, sneezing, rhinorrhea and the number of times patients had to blow their noses. Best results were obtained in patients with higher degrees of atopy. Side effects were minimal and limited to nasal irritation in some patients. Criteria for optimal patient selection are discussed and an explanation for the lack of systemic effects of aerosolized use of the newer corticosteroids is given.","title":"Flunisolide aerosol in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis.","pubmedId":"326101"}
