In addition, saliva samples from patients with HNSCC were screened for HPV detection.\nP16 overexpression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Tissue samples of leukoplakia (n \u003d 121) and HNSCC (n \u003d 427) and saliva from patients with HNSCC (n \u003d 215) were tested for HPV using nested polymerase chain reaction. Positive samples were sequenced for subtyping. The presence of HPV E6/E7 mRNA was confirmed by RNA in situ hybridization.\nP16 expression and HPV DNA were not detected in any of the leukoplakia specimens. Of the 427 HNSCC tumors, 9 showed p16 overexpression and 7/427 cases were positive for HPV16 DNA, in saliva or tissue. E6/E7 mRNA positivity was observed in 8 HNSCC samples, primarily from patients with no habit of tobacco consumption. The prevalence of high-risk HPV was restricted to oropharynx and larynx, with very little concordance between p16 overexpression and HPV positivity. All patients with HPV-positive saliva samples had transcriptionally active HPV present in their tumors.\nThe presence of HPV DNA does not necessarily reflect transcriptionally active virus in tumors; hence, it is important to consider this fact while categorizing HPV-associated tumors.","title":"Low prevalence of transcriptionally active human papilloma virus in Indian patients with HNSCC and leukoplakia.","pubmedId":"27765330"}
