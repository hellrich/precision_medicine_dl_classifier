However, most patients would face acquired resistance after one or two year treatment. Radiographic examination and clinical symptoms are the most common methods to detect disease progress, however, which lack sensitivity and specificity and lead to missing the best time point to change treatment. In the previous research, we found PGK1 was highly expressed in the patients with progressive disease after EGFR-TKI treatments. In this study, we detected PGK1 before and at the time of progression disease in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-TKIs treatment, and investigated its predictive effect to disease progression of EGFR-TKIs treatment. Methods: PGK1 in the serum was measured by a highly sensitive immunoassay method before and at the time of progression disease in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-TKIs treatment. Results: 39 patients were enrolled with a median age of 67 years old, stage IIIB/IV: 5/34, Male/Female:17/22, ECOG PS 0-1/2-3: 30/9. The response rate was 25.6% and median progression free time was 6.1 months. Serum PGK1 levels were significantly higher in the patients at progression disease after EGFR-TKI treatments than that at the baseline (0.483  0.033 ng/mL vs 0.29  0.012 ng/mL, p \u003c 0.01). Conclusions: PGK1 might be a new serum biomarker to be more sensitive and specific to early detection of disease progress after EGFR-TKI treatment in advanced NSCLC.","title":"Predictive effect of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 as a disease progressive marker after EGFR-TKI treatment in NSCLC patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_48994-74"}
