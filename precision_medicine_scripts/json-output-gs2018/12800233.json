The apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method using an Apop Tag in situ detection kit.\nThe immunoreactivity of iNOS significantly increased in the transition from hyperplastic ACF to dysplastic ACF. This transition was associated with a significant decrease in the apoptotic index (AI) (0.73+/-0.37 vs 0.61+/-0.35, P\u003c0.05) and significant increases in the PCNA labeling index (LI) (27.3+/-2.80 vs 40.3+/-3.11, P\u003c0.01) and microvessel density (MVD) (55+/-11.5 vs 70+/-13.2, P\u003c0.01). The expression of iNOS was in low levels and positively correlated with PCNA-LI (r\u003d0.812, P\u003c0.01) and MVD (r\u003d0.863, P\u003c0.01) during transition from normal mucosa to nonhyperplastic ACF and hyperplastic ACF. The expression of iNOS was in high levels and positively correlated with AI (r\u003d0.901, P\u003c0.01) after transition from hyperplastic ACF to dysplastic ACF, adenoma and carcinoma.\nThe results suggest that the transition from hyperplastic ACF to dysplastic ACF may be a crucial step in the ACF-adenoma-carcinoma sequence, in which iNOS plays an important role by regulating tumor cell apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenesis.","title":"Role of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in aberrant crypt foci-adenoma-carcinoma sequence.","pubmedId":"12800233"}
