Various studies have evaluated the prognostic value of EGFR or HER level in GC. However, the overall test performance remains unclear. We undertook this study to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic cohort studies evaluating the use of EGFR or HER2 as a predictor of survival time in patients with GC.\nEligible studies were identified through multiple search strategies. Studies were assessed for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Tool. Data were collected comparing overall survival (OS) in patients with high and low EGFR or HER2 level. Studies were pooled and summary hazard ratios were calculated.\nStudies were listed twice if they provided overall survival data for both EGFR and HER2. Eight studies (seven for EGFR and eight for HER2) were included. Two distinct groups were pooled for analysis and revealed that high EGFR, HER2 levels predicted poor overall (HR \u003d 1.66, 95% CI: 1.35-2.02) and (HR \u003d 1.43, 95% CI: 1.09-1.88) survival. No publication bias was found.\nThis meta-analysis result suggested that EGFR or HER2 should have significant predictive ability for estimating overall survival in GC patients and may be useful for defining prognosis of GC patients.","title":"Prognostic role of human epidermal growth factor receptor in gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"23871709"}
