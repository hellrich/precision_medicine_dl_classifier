The therapy targeting at FLT3 mutations might be a promising treatment for AML. Midostaurin can inhibit the activities of III receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by FLT3 gene, induce cell cycle arrest and has a apoptotic effect on primitive AML cells of FLT3 -mutant, FLT3 wild-type and the expression of FLT3 mutated receptor. In view of this, the association between FLT3 mutations and AML, and research advances and clinical applications of midostaurin on the treatment of AML especially for FLT3 mutated AML, are reviewed.
