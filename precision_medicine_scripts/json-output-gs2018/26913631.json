Recent trials suggest that tumors with a genetic basis for PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) ligand expression are highly sensitive to therapeutic antibodies targeting PD-1.\nTo determine the genetic status of CD274 (encoding PD-L1 [programmed cell death 1 ligand 1]) and PDCD1LG2 (encoding PD-L2 [programmed cell death 1 ligand 2]) in SCCs of the cervix and vulva and to correlate the findings with PD-L1 protein expression.\nWe performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes targeting CD274, PDCD1LG2, and the centromeric portion of chromosome 9, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an antibody recognizing PD-L1 on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens from 48 cervical SCCs and 23 vulvar SCCs.\nTumors were categorized according to the genetic abnormality in CD274 and PDCD1LG2 (coamplification \u003e cogain \u003e polysomy \u003e disomy) as detected by FISH, and evaluated on a semiquantitative scale (modified H score, the product of the percentage of tumor cells with positive staining and the maximum intensity of positive staining) for PD-L1 protein expression as detected by IHC.\nOverall, 71 samples of FFPE tissue from cases of cervical SCCs (n \u003d 48) and vulvar SCCs (n \u003d 23) were retrieved from the archives of Brigham and Women\u0027s Hospital and included in this study. We observed cogain or coamplification of CD274 and PDCD1LG2 in 32 of 48 cervical SCCs (67%) and 10 of 23 vulvar SCCs (43%). Median PD-L1 protein expression was highest among tumors with CD274 and PDCD1LG2 coamplification and lowest among tumors with disomy.\nRecurrent copy number gain of the genes encoding the PD-1 ligands provides a genetic basis for PD-L1 expression in a subset of cervical and vulvar SCCs and identifies a class of patients that are rational candidates for therapies targeting PD-1.","title":"Genetic Basis for PD-L1 Expression in Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Cervix and Vulva.","pubmedId":"26913631"}
