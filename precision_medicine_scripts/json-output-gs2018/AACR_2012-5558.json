However, their clinical significance, including possible interactions between these markers and other glioma biomarkers, is unclear. In this study a retrospective cohort of 198 pediatric low-grade gliomas (including 40 treated with adjuvant therapy) was analyzed for BRAF rearrangements, BRAF V600E, p16/CDKN2A deletion, p53 expression, and MIB1 proliferation index. In tumors with BRAF rearrangement, homozygous p16 deletion correlated with shorter PFS (P \u003d 0.04). High MIB1 proliferation index strongly trended toward correlating with worse response to adjuvant therapy (P \u003d 0.06). On multivariate analyses, the two most consistently powerful independent adverse prognostic markers were midline location (P \u003d 0.0001) and p16 deletion (P \u003d 0.03). Tumors with BRAF V600E had a strong trend toward an increased risk for progression (hazard ratio \u003d 2.48, P \u003d 0.07), whereas those with BRAF rearrangement had a milder trend toward reduced risk (hazard ratio \u003d 0.54, P \u003d 0.15). These data suggest that p16 deletion adversely impacts the outcomes of BRAF-driven gliomas; that high proliferation index may be a better marker of progression risk than BRAF; that BRAF rearrangement and BRAF V600E might not necessarily produce comparable outcomes; and that none of these markers is stronger than tumor location in determining prognosis in pediatric low-grade gliomas.","title":"Interplay between BRAF, p16, p53, and MIB1 in pediatric low grade gliomas","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5558"}
