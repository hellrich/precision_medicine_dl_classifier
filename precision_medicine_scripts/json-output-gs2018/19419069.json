We show the first results of the investigation of the gen BCR-ABL using RT-PCR, in order to look for the t(9;22)(q34;q11) in pediatric leukemic children. We studied in total 55 patients, 6 (10.9%) of them were positive for that translocation. Two (3.63%) of the positive children had ALL and the other 4 (7.27%) presented CML, the genotyping analysis of the transcript was studied in these children. With the introduction of this methodology as part of the routine studies, the leukemic children could get in the future an specific diagnosis, that will be important to classify them in prognostic categories and to improve the detection of minimal residual disease.","title":"[Molecular detection of the BCR-ABL gen by RT-PCR in Costa Rican children with leukemia].","pubmedId":"19419069"}
