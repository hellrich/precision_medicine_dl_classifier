Histochemical reaction was demonstrated by use of the avidin-biotin-method. Significant differences were obtained between the different markers used for each cell type as well as between the different cell types. For separating small cell anaplastic carcinoma from non small cell anaplastic carcinoma the markers carrying the histochemically crucial maltose, fucose, and mannose residues are useful, showing a positive reaction to only 4-8% of the small cell anaplastic carcinoma cases compared to 60-80% of the non small cell carcinoma cases. For separation of mesothelioma from pleuritis carcinomatosa a carrier, modified by attachment of N-acetylglucosamine moieties is the most useful marker being negative in all cases of the analyzed mesothelioma cases and being positive in 62-80% of the adenocarcinoma cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Is the profile of binding of a panel of neoglycoproteins useful as a diagnostic marker in human lung cancer?","pubmedId":"2550917"}
