However such reports are missing or very rare for male breast cancer. We determined the cytosolic levels of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), cathepsin D, pS2-protein, uPA, uPAR, PAI-1 and PAI-2 of the primary tumour tissues from 40 male breast cancer patients. The tumour levels were compared with those of 180 matched females and 4114 historic females with breast cancer. In male breast tumours the level of PgR was higher, those of uPA, PAI-1, PAI-2 and cathepsin D lower. The tumour level of ER in men was similar to those in the matched and postmenopausal women, but much higher than those in the historic women. Male breast cancer seems to be biologically different from female breast cancer. Correlation of the eight cell biologic factors with disease outcome showed that PAI-1 (p \u003d 0.03) was the only independent predictive factor for poor prognosis in male breast cancer.","title":"Clinical relevance of biologic factors in male breast cancer.","pubmedId":"11727961"}
