The most common benign tumour is the pleomorphic adenoma, whereas mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma predominate among the malignancies. Most salivary gland tumours occur in the parotid, and consequently clinical and biological data are normally derived from this site. This work describes the expressions of PCNA, Ki-67 and p53 in 15 pleomorphic adenomas, 15 mucoepidermoid carcinomas and 15 adenoid cystic carcinomas of the submandibular gland. Our results showed that all pleomorphic adenomas were negative for p53 and Ki-67 with 66.6% being positive for PCNA. Conversely, p53 was positive in 53% of the mucoepidermoid carcinomas and in 20% of the adenoid cystic carcinomas. Ki-67 was expressed in 47.7% of the mucoepidermoid carcinomas and 40% of the adenoid cystic carcinomas. All malignant tumours were positive for PCNA. These results indicate that the proliferative rate analysed with PCNA and Ki-67 and the expression of p53 in pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma of the submandibular gland were similar to those described in the parotid and minor salivary glands. However, mucoepidermoid carcinomas showed higher expression of these markers than those of other salivary glands. This work is the first describing the expression of these immunohistochemical markers exclusively in submandibular salivary gland tumours.","title":"PCNA, Ki-67 and p53 expressions in submandibular salivary gland tumours.","pubmedId":"15308260"}
