Eleven DNA markers located on chromosome 17 and nine randomly chosen markers representing chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11, were analysed. High resolution Giemsa banding of lymphocytes revealed no chromosomal rearrangement. The DNA from the neurofibromas were all found to have the same restricted fragment length polymorphism pattern as the constitutional DNA from the patient. In the malignant schwannoma a complete loss of one allele was found at polymorphic loci on chromosome arm 17p. One gene copy of the TP53 gene (17p13.1) and the NF1 gene (17q11.2) was lost, as was one copy of the PGA gene (11q13). No mutations were detected in the mutational hotspots of the TP53 gene. Partial losses were detected at three loci on chromosomes 1, 2 and 6, indicating a clonal variation within the tumour since histological evaluation disclosed no normal tissue in the analysed specimen. Our data indicate that the NF1 gene may function as a tumour suppressor gene, and that, either by effect of dose reduction or complete inactivation, both the NF1 gene and the TP53 gene may be critical for the progression of a neurofibroma to a malignant schwannoma. The observations made are consistent with the concept of stepwise multigenetic changes in tumour progression.","title":"Genetic alterations in a malignant schwannoma from a patient with neurofibromatosis (NF1).","pubmedId":"8351250"}
