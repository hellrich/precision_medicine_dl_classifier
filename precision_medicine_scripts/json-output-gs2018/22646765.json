The interim analysis results from this trial, BRIM-3, were sufficient for an independent data and safety monitoring board to recommend crossover from dacarbazine to vemurafenib, vemurafenib being associated with a relative risk reduction of 63% in the risk of death and 74% in the risk of death or disease progression compared with dacarbazine (p \u003c 0.001 for both comparisons) with an acceptable toxicity profile. Such striking results have prompted analysis of our approach to the classification and treatment of metastatic melanoma in an age of molecular markers and targeted therapy.","title":"BRIM-1, -2 and -3 trials: improved survival with vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma patients with a BRAF(V600E) mutation.","pubmedId":"22646765"}
