PD-L1 is one of the ligands of immune inhibitory receptor PD-1. PD-L1/PD-1 pathway suppresses T cell immune response, increases programmed cell death of activated T cells and plays an important role in tumor immune escape. Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy has shown promising results in certain malignancies, such as melanoma and lung cancer. Therefore, we performed PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining on 30 specimens of ovarian carcinosarcoma collected from patients that underwent surgeries at our institution between 2002 and 2015. In addition, we performed RNAscope in-situ hybridization to examine PD-L1 mRNA expression in 16 specimens that were collected within past 5 years (2010-2015). Our result demonstrated focally membranous expression of PD-L1 protein in 23 of 30 cases (77%). PD-L1 mRNA expression correlated with membranous, but not cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 protein. In conclusion, PD-L1 protein and mRNA are frequently expressed in ovarian carcinosarcoma, suggesting anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy may be helpful in these patients.","title":"Evaluation of PD-L1 expression in ovarian carcinosarcoma by immunohistochemistry and RNAscope in-situ hybridization","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2230"}
