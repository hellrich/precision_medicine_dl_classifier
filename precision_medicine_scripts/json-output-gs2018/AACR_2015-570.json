PD-L1 strong and weak positivity were defined to be traceable to the 1% and 50% cutoffs used in the clinical trial version of the assay. Concordance of PD-L1 expression between samples was analyzed by treating the IHC proportional score as a continuous and categorical variable.Results 90 patients were included (73 from Korea, 17 from Denmark). 75% were male, 37% had squamous cell carcinoma, and 83% had stage I-IIIA disease. 97% of first samples and 53% of second samples were from lung. 89% and 63%, respectively, were surgical samples, with a median interval of 20.9 months (range, 0.1-94.0) between collection dates; 91% of paired samples were collected \u003e3 months apart. A significant correlation of the PD-L1 IHC proportional score was observed for the paired samples (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.62; P \u003c 0.001). At the second time point, scores were identical in 39% of paired samples, higher in 32%, and lower in 29%. Of note, 12% of PD-L1-negative cases became positive and 20% of PD-L1-positive cases become negative at the second time point. The concordance rate was 56% (95% CI, 46%-67%) when PD-L1 expression was categorized as strong or weak positive or negative (Table).Conclusion Although a significant correlation of the PD-L1 IHC proportional score was observed, this preliminary analysis suggested a discordance rate of 44% between initial and subsequent NSCLC tumor samples when patients were categorized by PD-L1 expression level. Similar results were observed when analyzing paired melanoma samples. This discordance should be considered if PD-L1 expression is used for selection of enrollment in clinical trials.Table.
