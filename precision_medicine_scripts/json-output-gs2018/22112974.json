Cases were analyzed for time from diagnosis to referral, age, race, gender, socioeconomic status, antecedent hematologic disorder, cytotoxic or radiation therapy for prior malignancy, karyotype, fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3) mutations, intensive chemotherapy, clinical trial participation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and overall survival (OS).\nBlack patients (n\u003d105) were younger than white patients (n\u003d396) (54 vs. 61 years, p\u003c0.001), were more commonly female (55% vs. 45%, p\u003c0.001), and had a lower estimated median household income ($42,677 vs. $53,534 per year, p\u003c0.001). Black patients more frequently had complex karyotypes (26% vs. 12%, p\u003d0.002) and less frequently normal karyotypes (27% vs. 42%, p\u003d0.02). FLT3 mutation frequency was similar. Time to referral and proportion of patients receiving intensive chemotherapy did not differ, but both clinical trial participation (43% vs. 54%, p\u003d0.04) and HSCT (17% vs. 35% for patients â‰¤70 years old, p\u003d0.001) were less frequent in blacks than whites. Nevertheless, OS was similar in all black and white patients (median 15 vs. 14 months, p\u003d0.23), and when stratified by age, gender and karyotype risk classification.\nAML presentation and treatment differed in black and white patients, but OS was similar. Black patients appear to have barriers to clinical trial participation and HSCT, and there may be barriers to tertiary care referral for black males.","title":"Racial differences in presentation, referral and treatment patterns and survival in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia: a single-institution experience.","pubmedId":"22112974"}
