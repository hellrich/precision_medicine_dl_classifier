The availability of new drugs affecting the components of this pathway and pathways that may cooperate with MAPK signaling, means that targeted therapies are fast becoming a real option in the clinical management of melanoma. The authors discuss what they learned from clinical trials using first- and second-generation inhibitors to this pathway.","title":"BRAF signaling and targeted therapies in melanoma.","pubmedId":"19464601"}
