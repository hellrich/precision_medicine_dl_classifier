Flow cytometric analysis of the sialyl Le(x) and sialyl Le(a) antigens was also performed on the same cell lines. The sialyl Le(x) antigen was expressed on 14 of 15 epithelial cancer cell lines, and the sialyl Le(a) antigen was detected on 8 of them. The message of Fuc-TIII was detected in most of the epithelial cancer cell lines (14 of 15), which correlated with the surface expression of these carbohydrate determinants. In addition, the messages of Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVI were detected in most epithelial cancer cell lines, while the message of Fuc-TV was undetectable in most of them. On the other hand, all leukemia cell lines were positively stained for sialyl Le(x), but none of them was stained for sialyl Le(a) in flow cytometry. The messages of Fuc-TIV++ were detected in all leukemia cell lines tested. Small quantities of Fuc-TIII, V, and/or VI messages were also detected in some leukemia cell lines in reverse transcriptase mediated-polymerase chain reaction analysis. These studies indicate that alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferase activities in epithelial cancer and leukemia cell lines are mixtures of multiple molecular species of alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferases. It is natural that epithelial cancer cells contain a significant amount of Fuc-TIII mRNA and leukemia cell lines contain Fuc-TIV mRNA, since their normal counterparts, normal epithelial cells and leukocytes, respectively, are known to contain these fucosyltransferases. The unexpectedly frequent occurrence of Fuc-TIV mRNA in epithelial cancer cell lines may be related to their retro-differentiation associated with tumorigenesis. Another unexpected finding was a weak but significant expression of the alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferases Fuc-TIII, V, and/or VI in leukemia cell lines detected by reverse transcriptase mediated-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Since these enzymes are known to be capable of synthesizing the sialyl Le(x) determinant, this finding implies a possibility that some of them may be involved in the synthesis of sialyl Le(x) in leukemia cells.","title":"Expression of alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferases which synthesize sialyl Le(x) and sialyl Le(a), the carbohydrate ligands for E- and P-selectins,in human malignant cell lines.","pubmedId":"7693344"}
