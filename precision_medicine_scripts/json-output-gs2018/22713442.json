It is difficult to differentiate this tumor from hemangiomas, hemangioblastomas, Kaposi sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma and anaplastic melanomas.\nCase report and review of pertinent English medical literature.\nWe report a case of a 60-year-old male presenting with multiple nodules over the scalp where a preoperative histopathologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma was made by wedge biopsy from the tumor. Postoperative histopathology and immuno histochemistry of the wide local excision specimen proved the tumor to be cutaneous angiosarcoma and the patient completed adjuvant radiotherapy. He is now on regular follow-up for 1 year without recurrence.\nCutaneous angiosarcoma must be kept in mind in view of its rarity especially in extensive involvement of the scalp by malignancy. The primary treatment is wide local excision with adequate skin cover and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in positive margins and lymph node metastasis.","title":"Cutaneous angiosarcoma of the scalp masquerading as a squamous cell carcinoma: case report and literature review.","pubmedId":"22713442"}
