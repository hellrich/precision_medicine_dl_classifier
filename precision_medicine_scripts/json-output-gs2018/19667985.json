In grade II/III gliomas and in glioblastomas, chromosome 1p/19q codeletion and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase status remain the most important prognostic and predictive markers. Recently identified mutations in IDH1/IDH2, however, are specific for diffuse gliomas, occur frequently in grade II/III gliomas and are of prognostic value in grade III gliomas, as well in glioblastomas in which they characterize secondary glioblastomas.\nExtensive molecular studies have enabled the discovery of new diagnostic and prognostic markers that are refining the histomolecular classification of gliomas.","title":"Diagnostic and prognostic markers in gliomas.","pubmedId":"19667985"}
