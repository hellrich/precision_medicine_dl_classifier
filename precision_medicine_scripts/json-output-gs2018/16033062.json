Different treatments (sentinel node biopsy, inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, en bloc resection, adjuvant Interferon-alpha-therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy) are discussed. The complicated classification is reduced to a clinical path for daily use (UICC stage and invasion depth of Breslow, Clark\u0027s level and Chung\u0027s level).\nWe report on 10 patients, aged 26 to 76 years, with primary melanoma of the female genital tract. Seven women developed a vulvar melanoma and one woman a malignant melanoma of the cutaneous inguinal region, while another 2 women had an unusual primary location of the malignant melanoma, the cervico-vaginal region (n\u003d1) and the left ovary (n \u003d 1).\nInitial surgical modality did not influence long-term survival, but affected disease-free survival significantly.","title":"Primary melanoma of the female genital system: a report of 10 cases and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"16033062"}
