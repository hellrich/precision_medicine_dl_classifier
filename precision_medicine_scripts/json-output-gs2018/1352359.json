Reliable prognostic markers are needed, however, to help clinicians identify these patients and arrive at more rational treatment decisions.\nMutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene often result in overexpression of the p53 protein. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of p53 protein overexpression in patients with ANN breast cancer. We also studied the association between the tumor cell proliferation rate and overexpression of the p53 and c-erbB-2 proteins, both of which have been implicated in cell cycle control. The c-erbB-2 protein is the product of the ERBB2 gene.\nTwo hundred eighty-nine ANN cases were randomly selected from a population-based cohort of patients who had not received any kind of adjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. Overexpression of the p53 and c-erbB-2 proteins was studied immunohistochemically in archival paraffin-embedded tumor samples, using the CM-1 polyclonal and the TAb 250 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. The tumor cell proliferation rate was measured as the S-phase fraction by DNA flow cytometry. Statistical analyses were performed using BMDP software.\nHigh-level p53 protein overexpression, found in 41 of the 289 tumors, was most common in tumors with high histologic grade, negative estrogen receptor status, c-erbB-2 protein overexpression, DNA index greater than 1.3, or high S-phase fraction. The lowest S-phase levels were found in tumors with neither p53 nor c-erbB-2 protein overexpression; the highest levels were seen in tumors showing overexpression of both proteins (P less than .0001). Both p53 and c-erbB-2 overexpression, as well as tumor size, had independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis. Eight-year survival of patients with p53 protein overexpression was 56% compared with 81% in patients with no overexpression (relative risk, 3.7; P less than .0001). If the S-phase fraction was included in a Cox regression analysis, however, only the tumor size and the S-phase fraction emerged as independent predictors of survival.\nOverexpression of the p53 and c-erbB-2 proteins indicates a high malignant potential in ANN breast cancer, but it is not a significant prognostic factor independent of the cell proliferation rate. The correlation between overexpression of these proteins and an increased S-phase fraction suggests that they may confer a proliferative advantage to cancer cells in vivo.","title":"Association of overexpression of tumor suppressor protein p53 with rapid cell proliferation and poor prognosis in node-negative breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"1352359"}
