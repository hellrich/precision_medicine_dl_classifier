A decreasing trend in mortality was mainly achieved by improved early detection which led to an increased incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. For the patient\u0027s prognosis and the administration of a patient-tailored therapy strategy it is crucial to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers for high-risk DCIS patients. MUC1 is associated with tumour aggressiveness in human breast cancer. Recent studies used MUC1 splice variant A to identify malignant thyroid cancer. In the present study we have examined the usefulness of MUC1 splice variants as prognostic markers in DCIS. We used laser capture microdissection of paraffin-embedded tissue to isolate RNA from isolated tumour cells and determined the MUC1 splice variant distribution by RT-PCR. In the majority of cases variant B was more highly expressed than variant A. This was true for pure DCIS (66%) as well as for DCIS with adjacent invasive cancer (66%). In 7 out of 18 cases (38%) of pure DCIS variant A was not expressed at all. In DCIS with adjacent invasive cancer only 2 samples out of 12 showed this expression pattern (16%). The situation that variant A was more highly expressed than B, or that variant B was not expressed at all, was similar for pure DCIS (27%) and for DCIS with adjacent invasive cancer (33%). The present study describes the differences of MUC1 splice variant expression in pure DCIS compared to DCIS with adjacent invasive cancer. A discriminating pattern of MUC1 splice variants could not be demonstrated.","title":"Evaluation of MUC1 splice variants as prognostic markers in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.","pubmedId":"14534730"}
