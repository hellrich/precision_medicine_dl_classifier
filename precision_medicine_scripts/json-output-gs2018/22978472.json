Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were performed to analyse the prognosis of patients. Overexpression of EGFR and expression of EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII) were found in 102 cases (64.6%) and 47 cases (29.7%), respectively. Overexpression of EGFR was significantly correlated with World Health Organization (WHO) grade and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (both P \u003c 0.05). Expression of EGFRvIII was significantly correlated with WHO grade, gender, age, and KPS (all P \u003c 0.05). EGFR amplification was found in 46 cases (29.1%), and was significantly correlated with WHO grade, age, KPS and EGFR overexpression (all P \u003c 0.05). Cox multifactor analysis showed that EGFR amplification was an independent unfavourable prognostic factor for human gliomas at all ages, and EGFRvIII was an independent prognostic factor in patients older than 60 years.\nEGFR amplification and EGFRvIII expression were associated with an unfavourable prognosis for patients of all ages, and for those older than 60 years, respectively. The differing significance of EGFR status in young and old glioma patients and its impact on prognosis needs further study.","title":"Pathological significance of epidermal growth factor receptor expression and amplification in human gliomas.","pubmedId":"22978472"}
