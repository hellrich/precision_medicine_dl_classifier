No germline mutations were detected in the melanoma-associated tumor suppressor genes p16INK4a and p14ARF. Seven out of 10 siblings had a history of cutaneous and/or ocular nevi. Of the 3 subjects without nevi, 2 had histories of eye or skin malignancies (1 uveal melanoma, 1 basal cell carcinoma). Three of the 10 siblings had relevant ocular findings (2 choroidal nevi, 1 uveal melanoma). Six were also found to be in the \"high-risk\" classification for cutaneous malignancies based on scores from a previously validated risk assessment tool. This family, combined with the 91 previously reported familial uveal melanoma kindreds, brings to 92 the total number thus far recorded.\nOur results strengthen the association between uveal melanoma, atypical nevi, and cutaneous melanoma. This relationship supports the recommendation that individuals with a personal or family history of uveal melanoma, particularly in combination with atypical nevi, should be regularly screened for uveal and cutaneous melanoma.","title":"Genetic study of familial uveal melanoma: association of uveal and cutaneous melanoma with cutaneous and ocular nevi.","pubmedId":"17207529"}
