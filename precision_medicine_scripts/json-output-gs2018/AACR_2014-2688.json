Proteolytic degradation of MYCN protein is regulated in part by a kinase-independent function of Aurora kinase A. We describe a class of inhibitors that disrupts the native conformation of Aurora A and causes degradation of MYCN protein across MYCN-expressing neuroblastoma cell lines. Comparison of co-crystal structures with structure- activity relationships across multiple inhibitors and chemotypes, coupled with mechanistic studies and biochemical assays, delineates an Aurora A conformation-specific effect on proteolytic degradation of MYCN, rather than simple nanomolar-level inhibition of Aurora A kinase activity. This new class of inhibitors, which disrupts stabilizing interactions between Aurora A and MYCN, represents candidate agents to target MYCN-driven and potentially MYC-driven cancers.","title":"Drugging MYCN through an allosteric transition in Aurora A kinase","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2688"}
