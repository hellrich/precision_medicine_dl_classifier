Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma seems to have a poorer survival rate than classical squamous cell carcinoma. On the basis of a critical literature survey, we attempt to evaluate if basaloid squamous cell carcinoma is really more aggressive and presents a poorer outcome than squamous cell carcinoma.\nAll papers are retrospective, and most include small numbers of cases, which are further diminished when subdivided according to specific sites. Only in three studies was basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region compared with matched squamous cell carcinoma controls. These studies did not show a uniform tendency regarding the aggressiveness and outcome of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, several recent papers confirmed the presumed greater aggressiveness and worse outcome, and other recent papers questioned these characteristics.\nThe presented literature survey does not permit conclusions regarding the aggressiveness and outcome of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma compared with squamous cell carcinoma. Greater numbers of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma should be studied and compared with site-matched, stage-matched, and age-matched controls of conventional squamous cell carcinoma.","title":"Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"15167048"}
