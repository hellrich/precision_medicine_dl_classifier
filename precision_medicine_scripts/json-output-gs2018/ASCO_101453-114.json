We analysed a clinically annotated cohort of locoregionally advanced HNC for copy number changes and mutations and correlated with outcome in an exploratory fashion.  Methods:  120 head and neck cancers (frozen tissue) and matching normal tissues/blood from patients with locoregionally advanced HNC treated with definitive chemoradiation +/- induction at the University of Chicago were obtained from our tissue bank. DNA, RNA, protein were extracted. Barcoded, multiplexed sequencing libraries for 500 head and neck cancer associated genes (Agilent capture) were built and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq next generation sequencers. 150 commonly copy number altered and HNC relevant genes were analysed for copy number alterations (CNA) using the Nanostring nCounter platform. Respective genetic aberrations in curated pathways were allocated to tumor subgroups.  Exploratory analysis correlated data with induction response and progression free survival. Confirmatory HPV testing was performed using an E6, nested, multiplex PCR. Results:  80% of targeted sequences were successfully captured and sequenced. Commonly mutated genes included: TP53, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, NOTCH1. Of note PIK3CA mutations were enriched in HPV(+) tumors. Commonly copy number altered genes included amplifications of VEGF1, CCND1, MYC, EGFR, MDM4, CTTN, as well as PIK3CA, and deletions of CDKN2A, SUCLG2, FHIT, TGFBR2, PTPRD, IKBKG, TRAF6, and RASSF1. CCND1, and MYC were commonly co-amplified and correlated with poor progression free survival, representing a distinct HNC phenotype. Analysis for additional genes and influence on induction response will be presented.  Conclusions:  Targeted, medium throughput genomic profiling is feasible, and provides the majority of HNC specific genetic aberrations at a comparably low cost. Impact on outcome (CCND1/MYC amplification) and potential treatment targets (PIK3CA mutations in HPV(+) tumors) were identified.","title":"Genomic profiling of a clinically annotated cohort of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancers (HNC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_101453-114"}
