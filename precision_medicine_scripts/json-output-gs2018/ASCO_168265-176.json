Combination therapy has been attempted in practice to improve disease control in BMMM pts. We report our single-institution experience using anti-PD therapy both alone and in combination with BRAFi in BMMM. Methods: At MD Anderson Cancer Center, 457 metastatic melanoma pts (excluding uveal melanomas) received anti-PD therapy between November 2009 and December 2015. Among the 113 pts (25%) with BMMM, 34 (30%) pts were BRAFi-nave and 79 (70%) were previously treated with BRAFi. These pts were separated into 4 cohorts based on exposure to BRAFi prior to anti-PD therapy (BRAFi nave vs. treated) and whether anti-PD therapy was administered alone or in combination with BRAFi. Data were collected and analyzed for rates and duration of responses (RECIST v1.1) or disease stabilization. Results: See table. Conclusions: Our retrospective study showed anti-PD therapy alone had robust antitumor activity in pts with BMMM, regardless of prior BRAFi exposure.BRAFi-nave pts appeared to achieve higher response rates with the combination of BRAFi and anti-PD therapy than with anti-PD therapy alone; however, the number of pts was small. BRAFi-treated pts derived less benefit from combined BRAFi and anti-PD therapy than from anti-PD alone.
