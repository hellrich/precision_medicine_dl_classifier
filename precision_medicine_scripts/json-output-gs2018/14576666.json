PTEN staining in cutaneous lymphatics, dermal and periadnexal adventitial fibroblasts, and chondrocytes were variably absent. Junctional melanocytes and chondrocytes frequently exhibited preferential nuclear staining. We found uniformly strong PTEN expression in the cytoplasm of almost all benign and dysplastic nevi. However, there was some evidence of nuclear PTEN loss even in the benign melanocytic proliferations. In addition, out of 30 primary cutaneous melanomas and lentigo malignas, we detected diffuse expression of PTEN in 11 (37%) tumors, widespread loss of PTEN in 11 (37%) tumors and mixed PTEN expression in 8 (27%) lesions. In the primary cutaneous melanomas, PTEN was largely localized to the cytoplasm.\nThe presence of PTEN in benign melanocytic tumors and the absence of PTEN in a significant proportion of primary cutaneous melanomas support a role for PTEN loss in the pathogenesis of melanoma.","title":"PTEN expression in normal skin, acquired melanocytic nevi, and cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"14576666"}
