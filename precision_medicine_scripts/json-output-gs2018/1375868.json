CT inhibited the growth of nine SCLC cell lines (concentration for 50% inhibition of growth, 27-700 ng/ml), all of which had abundant expression of GM1 ganglioside, the surface receptor for CT. CT-resistant SCLC all had greatly decreased GM1 expression. In contrast, CT inhibited the growth of only four of 15 NSCLC cell lines. Seven of the 11 CT-resistant NSCLC had levels of GM1 comparable to CT-sensitive NSCLC or SCLC. In a limited panel of cell lines, cyclic AMP (cAMP) agonists including forskolin, 8Br[cAMP], and dibutyryl[cAMP] did not consistently reproduce CT-mediated inhibition of cell growth, nor did these compounds overcome resistance of cells to the growth inhibitory effects of CT. Expression of the RI and RII regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was similar in CT-resistant and CT-sensitive SCLC or NSCLC cell lines. In the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, intracellular cAMP levels induced by CT in a CT-resistant, GM1(+) NSCLC cell line were comparable to those achieved in a CT-sensitive NSCLC cell line. We conclude that inhibition of lung carcinoma cell growth by CT in all cases requires expression of GM1, and in the case of SCLC cell lines the presence of GM1 is sufficient. In NSCLC cell lines, expression of GM1 is not sufficient for growth inhibition by CT. These findings imply refractoriness to growth inhibition by cAMP in GM1(+), CT-resistant NSCLC cell lines and the possibility of non-cAMP-related mechanisms for growth inhibition in CT-sensitive cell lines.","title":"Growth inhibition by cholera toxin of human lung carcinoma cell lines: correlation with GM1 ganglioside expression.","pubmedId":"1375868"}
