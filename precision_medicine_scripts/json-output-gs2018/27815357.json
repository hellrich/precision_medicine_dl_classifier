We sought inter- and intra-locus correlations between mutations, and variant-specific associations with survival and clinicopathology.\nKRAS mutations were rarely found together and those in codons 12 and 13 conferred poor prognosis (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.28-1.61, p\u003d6.4e-10 and HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.26-1.86, p\u003d1.5e-05, respectively). For BRAF, more c.1781A\u003eG (p.D594G) CRCs carried RAS mutations (14% [3/21]) compared to c.1799T\u003eA (p.V600E) CRCs (1% [2/178], p\u003d9.0e-03). c.1799T\u003eA (p.V600E) was associated with poor prognosis (HR 2.60, 95% CI 2.06-3.28, p\u003d1.0e-15), whereas c.1781A\u003eG (p.D594G) was not (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.73-2.31, p\u003d0.37); this intra-locus difference was significant (p\u003d0.04). More c.1799T\u003eA (p.V600E) CRCs were found in the right colon (47% [47/100]), compared to c.1781A\u003eG (p.D594G) CRCs (7% [1/15], p\u003d3.7e-03). For NRAS, 5% (3/60) of codon 61 mutant CRCs had KRAS mutations compared to 44% (10/23) of codons 12 and 13 mutant CRCs (p\u003d7.9e-05). Codon 61 mutations conferred poor prognosis (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.09-1.99, p\u003d0.01), whereas codons 12 and 13 mutations did not (HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.64-2.58, p\u003d0.48).\nOur data show considerable intra-locus variation in the outcomes of mutations in BRAF and NRAS. These data need to be considered in patient management and personalised cancer therapy.","title":"BRAF and NRAS locus specific variants have different outcomes on survival to colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"27815357"}
