Previously, we have shown in 400 patients (pts) that the introduction of new morphology criteria, combined with more frequently performed FNAC and overnight cytology reports can accurately identify up to 65% of lymph node metastases. The current study aim was to increase statistical power with twice as many patients and prolonged follow-up. Methods: Currently, 800 stage I/II melanoma pts have been analyzed of the 880 pts in the database. All pts underwent lymphoscintigraphy followed by an US-exam. US images were scored for our morphology criteria, FNAC was performed in all suspicious US results. All pts underwent a SN. Sensitivity (sens), specificity (spec) and negative/positive predictive value (NPV and PPV) were calculated. SN tumor burden and survival analyses were performed. Results: Since 2001, 800 consecutive pts with a mean follow-up of 37 months (1-104) with a median/mean Breslow of 1.6/2.68 mm were analyzed. 56% were male, ulceration was present in 27%. SN positivity rate was 21% (n \u003d 167). Sens and spec of US-guided FNAC (overall) was 93/167 (56%) and 625/633 (99%). PPV and NPV of the overall technique were 92% and 89%. 5-ys OS was 50% for US-guided FNAC pos vs 92% for neg. Sens, spec, PPV and NPV of balloon shaped (BS) were 29%, 99%, 94%, 83% respectively, whereas, sens, spec, PPV and NPV of peripheral perfusion (PP) were 72%, 82%, 53%, 91% respectively. The limit for a positive FNAC was metastases of 0.4 mm in maximum diameter. Sensitivity of US-guided FNAC increases with increasing T stage and increasing SN tumor burden. Conclusions: This largest prospective study worldwide on the subject of pre-SN ultrasound-guided FNAC confirms our previous results that US-guided FNAC can be a cost-effective alternative to the SN. Tumor stage and SN tumor burden drive the yield of US-guided FNAC. Peripheral perfusion is an early sign of metastases and has significantly increased the sensitivity of US-guided FNAC.","title":"Early ultrasound criteria drive sensitivity for detection of sentinel node metastases in melanoma patients: A prospective study in 800 patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_43305-74"}
