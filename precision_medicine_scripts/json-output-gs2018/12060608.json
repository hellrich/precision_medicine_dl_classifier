ErbB2, a tyrosinekinase receptor, is overexpressed in clinically significant tumors, such as breast, ovary, and lung carcinomas. In normal tissues, it is expressed only in certain epithelial cell types.\nA large phagemid library (Griffin.1 library) of human scFv was used for the isolation of the ErbB2-specific scFv. A very effective strategy was developed for the isolation, consisting in a double subtractive selection, the use of two different combinations of \"positive,\" i.e., ErbB2-bearing, and \"negative\" cell lines.\nHere we report the isolation of the first human anti-ErbB2 mini-antibody endowed with antitumor action. Both in its soluble and phage format, it binds specifically to ErbB2, inhibits its autophosphorylation, is internalized by target cells, and exerts a strong and specific antiproliferative action on ErbB2-positive target cells. A correlation was found between the extent of this antiproliferative effect and the expression levels of ErbB2 on target cells, with a strong cytotoxicity for hyper-expressing cells, such as SKBR3, in which apoptosis was evidenced.\nThis scFv is a potentially effective immunoreagent for diagnostics and therapeutics of certain cancers, both as a readily diffused molecule in solid tumors and as an essential asset for the construction of fully human anticancer drugs.","title":"A new human antitumor immunoreagent specific for ErbB2.","pubmedId":"12060608"}
