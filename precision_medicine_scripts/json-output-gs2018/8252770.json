Four years later and after intercurrent influenza, disseminated metastases of malignant melanoma to the skin occurred. After a further 6 months melanodermia developed and lasted until the death of the patient (6 months later). Autopsy revealed melanosis of the visceral organs. Histology taken from internal organs using S-100 protein and HMB-45 melanoma methods confirmed metastases of malignant melanoma to the skin, oral cavity, palatal tonsils, nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosae, lungs, myocardium and brain. The authors discuss the mechanism of melanosis--a rare sign in patients with metastasizing malignant melanoma.","title":"Generalized melanosis with malignant melanoma metastasizing to skin--a pathological study with S-100 protein and HMB-45.","pubmedId":"8252770"}
