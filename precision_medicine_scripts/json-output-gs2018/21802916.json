Our aim has been to identify whether human primary trigeminal neurons label with c-kit/CD117 and thus, whether data gathered in animal studies can be extrapolated to humans. We also intended to establish whether, and which non-neuronal cells also label with c-kit in the trigeminal ganglion.\nHuman adult trigeminal ganglia from eight cadavers were processed for immunohistochemistry on paraffin embedded samples using monoclonal antibodies for CD117/c-kit, and three additional trigeminal ganglia were used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To evaluate which neuronal type (A or B) was labeled with c-kit, we evaluated the same neurons on adjacent sections labeled with antibodies for neurofilaments (NF).\nc-kit has labeled trigeminal neurons (TNs), mast cells and interstitial cells (ICs) within the trigeminal ganglion. c-kit+TNs were NF-and thus were strongly presumed to be nociceptive, as such neurons are known to be NF-poor. c-kit+ICs with long and moniliform processes intermingled with the satellite glial cells (SGCs) of the neuronal envelopes. TEM evaluations confirmed this mixed composition of the neuronal envelopes and demonstrated that the perineuronal ICs are in fact interstitial Cajal-like cells (ICLCs) and/or telocytes.\nc-kit+TNs were objectified in humans and strongly presumed to be nociceptive. TNs envelopes mostly consist of SGCs, but are also combined with ICLCs/telocytes.","title":"The human trigeminal ganglion: c-kit positive neurons and interstitial cells.","pubmedId":"21802916"}
