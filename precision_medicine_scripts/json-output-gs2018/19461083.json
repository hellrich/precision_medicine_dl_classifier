Immunohistologic study of benign nevi (BN), dysplastic nevi (DN), and primary superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) was performed for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CEA cell adhesion molecule-1 (CEACAM1) using monoclonal antibodies. We investigated BN (n \u003d 42), DN (n \u003d 22), thin SSM (n \u003d 21), and thick SSM (n \u003d 21). CEA expression in melanomas and DN was significantly increased compared with BN. CEA expression in thick SSM was significantly higher than in DN. Compared with BN, expression of CEACAM1 in melanomas was significantly increased. CEACAM1 expression in thick SSM was significantly increased compared with DN and thin SSM. Our data support the findings of previous studies indicating that cell adhesion molecules of the CEA family may have a role in the development and progression of cutaneous melanoma and potentially serve as prognostic markers.","title":"Protein expression of carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules in benign and malignant melanocytic skin lesions.","pubmedId":"19461083"}
