However, 25-30% of patients with EGFRmu show intrinsic resistance, and the responders invariably acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Here, we examined the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a specific ligand of MET, in gefitinib resistance of NSCLC with EGFRmu. Methods: NSCLC cells, PC-9 and HCC827, with EGFRmu, but not T790M second mutation in EGFR or MET amplification, were used in this study. Sensitivity to gefitinib was determined by MTT assay. Phosphorylation of MET, EGFR, ERBB3, and the PI3K/Akt pathway were examined by Western blotting. HGF expression in 20 tumors from 16 NSCLC patients with EGFRmu who were treated with gefitinib was determined by immunohistochemistry. Results: HGF induced resistance to gefitinib by restoring Akt phosphorylation independently of ErbB3. Specific down-regulation of MET, but not ErbB3, reversed gefitinib resistance and Akt phosphorylation induced by HGF. Importantly, high levels of immunoreactivity for HGF were detected in cancer cells of 3 of 3 intrinsic resistant tumors and in one of 2 tumors with acquired resistance without T790M second mutation or MET amplification. Conclusions: The findings indicate that HGF-mediated MET activation is a novel mechanism of intrinsic and acquired gefitinib-resistance in NSCLC with EGFRmu. Therefore, inhibition of HGF-MET signaling may be considerable strategy for more successful treatment with EGFR-TKIs.","title":"Hepatocyte growth factor as inducer of gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR activating mutations.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32524-65"}
