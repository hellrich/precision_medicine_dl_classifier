Perforative rectal cancer was diagnosed, and an emergency laparotomy was done. Transient colostomy and drainage for peritonitis were performed. Preoperatively rectal cancer was assessed to invade the sacral bone and prostate. A total of 50 Gy radiation therapy with low dose CDDP+5-FU chemotherapy was conducted for five weeks. Remarkable shrinkage of the tumor was found, and elective surgery for curative intent was done on April 2000. The tumor seemed to invade the adjacent tissues such as prostate and urine bladder, so extensive resection of the urine bladder and sacral bone was done in addition to abdominal perineal resection. Pathological exploration showed complete regression of the tumor and no tumor invasion to the prostate and sacral bone. He is well without tumor relapse. Once complete regression of the rectal cancer by chemo-radiation therapy has been achieved, relapse of the tumor was reported to be rare. Preoperative chemo-radiation therapy is an effective tool to control the advanced rectal cancer.","title":"[A case of advanced rectal carcinoma, preoperative chemo-radiation therapy leading to histological complete response].","pubmedId":"16969039"}
