The same evolutionary sequences that are present within each lung cancer were evident in intertumor comparisons.\nCorrelated cell by cell measurements of cell DNA content, p53, Her-2/neu, and ras proteins were obtained by multiparameter flow cytometry on 46 surgically resected stage I-III primary non-small cell lung cancers. Early evolutionary changes were identified by the fact that they could appear alone in individual cells. Later appearing abnormalities were identified by the fact that they were accompanied by early abnormalities in the same cells. Patients were followed prospectively. Evolutionary patterns observed in individual tumors were correlated with subsequent clinical outcome of patients undergoing surgical resection.\nThree common patterns were identified: (I) a diploid DNA pathway consisting of the sequence p53 overexpression --\u003e Her-2/neu overexpression --\u003e ras overexpression, (II) an aneuploid DNA pathway with the same p53 --\u003e Her-2/neu --\u003e ras sequence, and (III) a pathway in which none of the intracellular protein measurements made here were abnormal. Fourteen tumors recurred after 11.5 months\u0027 median study time. Nine of 12 recurrences in pathways I and II occurred in patients whose tumors were far advanced along these molecular genetic pathways.\nMultiparameter cell-based genetic evolutionary studies may be a promising approach for identifying patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer at high risk for recurrence.","title":"Genetic evolutionary staging of early non-small cell lung cancer: the P53 --\u003e HER-2/NEU --\u003e ras sequence.","pubmedId":"10424999"}
