The intention here is to provide a synopsis of current progress in this developing area by reviewing existing publications and ongoing clinical trials. While bevacizumab plus anti-EGFR agents exhibit detrimental effects in first-line setting , a combination of bevacizumab with erlotinib has been suggested as an effective maintenance therapy. Dabrafenib plus panitumumab in combination with trametinib and encorafenib plus cetuximab in combination with alpelisib, are very promising combination treatments and are currently being developed in clinical trials for patients with BRAF mutant-type tumors. An earlier nonclinical trial suggested that a combination of panitumumab plus trametinib was effective in patients who were resistant to anti- EGFR agents but developing KRAS- or NRAS-mutated tumors. The HERACLES trial further indicated that a combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib showed promising antitumor effects in patients with emerging HER2 amplification. Other reports suggest that irinotecan and cetuximab in combination with tivantinib were more effective than a combination of irinotecan and cetuximab alone for patients with MET amplification, although further research is needed for this application, as results were based upon the analysis of subgroups. It is clear that data arising from both primary research and clinical trials support the combined use of molecular-targeted drugs in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. As clinical trials progress, it is likely that such treatment combinations will become recognized as standard therapies.
