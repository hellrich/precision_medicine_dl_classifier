KIT immunoreactivity and mutation status was assessed in 41 ALM and 25 MM patients. Of these, 19 ALM and 15 MM patients had matched primary and metastatic lesions. P-ERK was investigated in a subset of 9 ALM and 7 MM matched primary/metastatic pairs by immunohistochemistry. Heterogeneous KIT immunoreactivity was observed in both primary and metastatic lesions. Mutations were present in four of 41 ALM (10%) and five of 25 MM (20%) patients. Only vulvar mucosal samples carried KIT mutations in contrast to sinonasal lesions (p \u003d 0.0109). In KIT-mutated tumours, the mutations were present in KIT expressing as well as KIT negative cells, as shown by Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM). P-ERK expression was preferentially found in metastases. KIT mutations predict treatment outcome with KIT inhibitors. Therefore, especially vulvar melanoma patients should be screened for activating KIT mutations.","title":"Sinonasal, genital and acrolentiginous melanomas show distinct characteristics of KIT expression and mutations.","pubmedId":"22464346"}
