We examined PIK3CA amplification in colorectal precancerous legions, including TAs and SPs. DNA was isolated from paired normal and tumoral tissues in 64 TAs and 32 SPs. PIK3CA amplification, KRAS mutation, and BRAF mutation were analyzed by real-time PCR. PIK3CA amplification was found in 25% of TAs and 9.4% of SPs, respectively and low and high grade of TAs showed similar frequency of PIK3CA amplification. KRAS and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive in both TAs and SPs. In TAs, PIK3CA amplification was associated with distal colon and it was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutation. These results suggest that PIK3CA amplification may be early and important event in colorectal carcinogenesis and may drive the development of TAs independently with KRAS mutation.Keyword: colorectal cancer, PIK3CA amplification, serrated polyps, tubular adenomasNote: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.","title":"PIK3CA amplification was not associated with serrated polyps but tubular adenomas in colorectal lesions","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2202"}
