The highest percentage of contractures occurred in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The number of contractures was significantly greater (p less than .001) (1) in the lower than in the upper extremities; (2) in diseases considered myopathic than in those considered neuropathic; (3) in diseases that are X-linked than in those that are not; and (4) in rapidly progressive than in slowly progressive diseases.","title":"Contractures in neuromuscular disease.","pubmedId":"1514888"}
