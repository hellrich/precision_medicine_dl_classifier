The following pathological prognostic factors are considered and discussed: location, histopathology, lymph node metastasis. In addition, a number of molecular genetic markers have been identified such as: DNA content, chromosomal abnormalities, cell proliferation, RAS gene family, epidermal growth factor and its receptor, tumor-suppressor genes, cell adhesion molecules and proteinases.","title":"Prognostic factors in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"10635383"}
