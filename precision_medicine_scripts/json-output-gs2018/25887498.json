A phase 1 dose escalation study of danusertib was conducted in patients with accelerated or blastic phase chronic myeloid leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two dosing schedules were studied: schedule A, in which danusertib was given by 3-hour intravenous infusion daily for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) in a 14-day cycle, and schedule B, in which the danusertib was given by 3-hour intravenous infusion daily for 14 consecutive days (days 1-14) in a 21-day cycle. A total of 37 patients were treated, 29 with schedule A and eight with schedule B. The recommended phase 2 dose for schedule A was 180 mg/m(2). Enrollment to schedule B was stopped early because of logistical problems with the frequency of infusions. Febrile neutropenia and mucositis were dose-limiting toxicities in schedule A. Four patients with T315I ABL kinase mutation, all treated with schedule A, responded. Danusertib has an acceptable toxicity profile and is active in patients with Bcr-Abl-associated advanced hematologic malignancies. This study was registered with the European Clinical Trails Data Base (EudraCT number 2007-004070-18).
