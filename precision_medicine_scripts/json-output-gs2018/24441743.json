Sorafenib, a small molecule with multiple potential beneficial actions, appears particularly promising. We reviewed the outcomes of 30 patients with recurrent or progressive HGG treated with sorafenib within a named patient program. Overall, 16 patients suffered from recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme and 14 patients had grade 3 gliomas. All but four patients had previously undergone surgical debulking; all but one patient had received previous standard multimodal treatment; and 18 patients (60%) had received more than one line of chemotherapy, in median three. Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from initiation of sorafenib to treatment discontinuation because of tumor progression or death, was selected as the endpoint. The use of sorafenib resulted in a median PFS of 3 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-4.1 months] in patients with glioblastoma and of 3.1 months (95% CI 1.4-4.8 months) in patients with other HGG. The PFS-6 for the whole cohort was 23%. Sixteen patients reported adverse events, mostly moderate, with hypertension as the most frequently reported toxicity (seven patients). One patient died of cerebral bleeding (grade 5 toxicity). The overall survival after initiation of sorafenib was 6 months (95% CI 3.9-8.0 months) for patients with glioblastoma multiforme and 10 months (95% CI 3.1-16.9 months) for patients with HGG. In this retrospective analysis of heavily pretreated patients with HGG, sorafenib monotherapy was associated with tumor stabilization in a small subset of patients. The risk-benefit ratio was acceptable in the context of an apparent clinical benefit in patients with a fatal disease.
