The functional loss of RB1 is recognized to be one of the hallmarks that differentiate cancer cells from normal cells. Many researchers are attempting to develop anti-tumor agents that are preferentially effective against RB1-negative tumors. However, to identify patients with RB1-negative cancers, it is imperative to develop predictive biomarkers to classify RB1-positive and -negative tumors.\nExpression profiling of 30 cancer cell lines composed of 16 RB1-positive and 14 RB1-negative cancers was performed to find genes that are differentially expressed between the two groups, resulting in the identification of an RB1 signature with 194 genes. Among them, critical RB1 pathway components CDKN2A and CCND1 were included. We found that microarray data of the expression ratio of CCND1 and CDKN2A clearly distinguished the RB1 status of 30 cells lines. Measurement of the CCND1/CDKN2A mRNA expression ratio in additional cell lines by RT-PCR accurately predicted RB1 status (12/12 cells lines). The expression of CCND1/CDKN2A also correlated with RB1 status in xenograft tumors in vivo. Lastly, a CCND1/CDKN2A assay with clinical samples showed that uterine cervical and small cell lung cancers known to have a high prevalence of RB1-decifiency were predicted to be 100% RB1-negative, while uterine endometrial or gastric cancers were predicted to be 5-22% negative. All clinically normal tissues were 100% RB1-positive.\nWe report here that the CCND1/CDKN2A mRNA expression ratio predicts the RB1 status of cell lines in vitro and xenograft tumors and clinical tumor samples in vivo. Given the high predictive accuracy and quantitative nature of the CCND1/CDKN2A expression assay, the assay could be utilized to stratify patients for anti-tumor agents with preferential effects on either RB1-positive or -negative tumors.","title":"Expression ratio of CCND1 to CDKN2A mRNA predicts RB1 status of cultured cancer cell lines and clinical tumor samples.","pubmedId":"21447152"}
