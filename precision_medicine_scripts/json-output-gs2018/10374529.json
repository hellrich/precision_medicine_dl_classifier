Twenty osteosarcomas were examined with biotin-labelled oligodeoxynucleotide probe in situ. Of 20 tumors, 8 (40%) and 6(30%) showed positive expression of p53 and MDM2 genes, respectively. Among these, 2 tumors revealed co-expression of both p53 and MDM2 genes. This study confirmed the existence of aberrant mRNA expression of p53 and MDM2 genes in osteosarcoma.","title":"[Detection of p53 and MDM2 gene expression in osteosarcoma with biotin-labelled in situ].","pubmedId":"10374529"}
