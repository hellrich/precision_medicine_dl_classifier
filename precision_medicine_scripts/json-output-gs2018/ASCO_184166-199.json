ENCORE 601 is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of ENT in combination with PEMBRO. Phase 1b identified ENT 5 mg PO weekly and PEMBRO 200 mg IV every 3 weeks as the recommended Phase 2 dose for further investigation. Methods: Phase 2 of ENCORE 601 employs a Simon 2-stage design to assess activity across 3 cohorts: 1) NSCLC not previously treated with a PD-1/L1 blocking antibody, 2\u00263) NSCLC \u0026 melanoma previously progressing on or after a PD-1/L1 blocking antibody. Patients were enrolled irrespective of PD-L1 expression levels. The primary endpoint is ORR as assessed by irRECIST. Results of the first stage of Cohort 3 are reported. Criteria for advancing to Stage 2 are 2 responses out of 13 evaluable patients. Results: Stage 1 enrollment has been completed (n \u003d 13). All patients received a prior PD-1 inhibitor; in addition, 7 patients received prior ipilimumab and 2 patients received a prior BRAF inhibitor. 9 patients are still on treatment; 4 patients have discontinued due to progression. To date, 1 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed objective response have been observed. The confirmed response (PR) was in a patient who was previously treated with ipilimumab/nivolumab for 6 months (best response of SD with subsequent progression on therapy). Treatment-related AEs occurred in 5 patients (most common being nausea and fatigue occurring in 2 patients); one patient experienced Gr3/4 events (fatigue and rash). Blood samples and pre-treatment biopsies were obtained in all patients along with paired post-treatment biopsies in 8 patients. Evaluation of PD-L1 expression, gene expression, myeloid and lymphoid compartments in blood and tumor samples is in progress. Of note, the patient with a confirmed PR converted from a PD-L1 negative, non-inflamed gene signature to PD-L1 positive, inflamed after 2 weeks of treatment. Conclusions: ENT combined with PEMBRO demonstrates acceptable safety and encouraging preliminary activity in melanoma patients refractory to checkpoint inhibitors.
