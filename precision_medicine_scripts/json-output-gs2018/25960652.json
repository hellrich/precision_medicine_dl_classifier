However, drug resistance to BRAF inhibitors happens just like other cancer treatment. In this study, we constructed the ideal BRAF(V600E)-modeled structure through homology modeling and introduced the method of structure-based docking or virtual screening from the large compound database. Through certain methods of molecular dynamics simulation, we realized that BRAF(V600E) had quite prominent difference of molecular character or structural variation from the wild-type BRAF protein. It might confer the metamorphic character of advanced melanoma for the patients who harbored BRAF(V600E) mutation. By the methods of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship and molecular dynamics simulation, we further recommend that aknadicine and 16beta-hydroxy-19s-vindolinine N-oxide from the traditional Chinese medicine are potent novel inhibitors for the management of malignant melanoma in the future.
