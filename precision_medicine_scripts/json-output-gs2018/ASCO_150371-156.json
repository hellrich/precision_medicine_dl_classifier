We therefore tested the hypothesis that MMP-23 can negatively regulate the anti-tumor T cell response in human melanoma.  Methods:  We characterized MMP-23 expression in primary melanoma patients who received adjuvant immunotherapy. We examined the association of MMP-23 with the intrinsic anti-tumor immune response - as assessed by the prevalence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells. Further, we examined the association between MMP-23 expression and response to immunotherapy. We used in vitro 3D culture assays to assess T cell lysis of tumor cells expressing MMP-23, and mutagenesis of MMP-23 functional domains to identify the molecular mechanism of MMP-23 inhibition of T cell responses.  Results:  Our data revealed an inverse association between primary melanoma MMP-23 expression and the anti-tumor T-cell response, as demonstrated by decreased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (P\u003d 0.05), in particular brisk TILs (P\u003d 0.04), and a trend towards an increased proportion of immunosuppressive Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (P\u003d 0.07). High melanoma MMP-23 expression is also associated with recurrence in patients treated with immune biologics (P\u003d 0.037). Further, high melanoma MMP-23 expression is associated with shorter periods of progression-free survival for patients receiving immune biologics. In vitro data supports a role for MMP-23 in blocking Kv1.3 channels on activated effector memory T cells.  Conclusions:  Our data suggest that MMP-23 may affect Kv1.3-dependent effector memory T cells. This support a potential role for MMP-23 as a biomarker and immunotherapeutic target in melanoma.","title":"Association of melanoma expression of matrix metalloproteinase-23 with blunted tumor immunity and poor responses to immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150371-156"}
