Preclinical and Phase 1 clinical data show the drug has minimal activity in tumors lacking BRAF mutations, creating a need for an accurate diagnostic test to identify appropriate patients for therapy. Methods: To assess eligibility for BRIM-2, a Phase 2 trial of V in patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma,  tumor samples were screened with an investigational PCR assay (cobas 4800 BRAF  V600 Mutation Test) designed to detect the canonical V600E (1799T\u003eA) mutation. 328 samples were tested of which 327 samples gave valid results. BRAF mutations were detected in 184 (56.3 %); 132 patients with BRAF-mutation positive melanoma were enrolled into the trial based on clinical eligibility criteria. Sanger sequencing was performed retrospectively on DNA samples from all  enrolled patients. Results: Fifteen samples (11.4%) gave invalid Sanger results. Sanger detected a V600E mutation in 97 samples (73.5%), V600K mutation in 9 samples (6.8%)  and a wild-type (WT) result in 11 cases (8.3%). Samples were also subjected to deep sequencing with a quantitative picotiter plate pyrosequencing method (454 GS-Titanium) to resolve differences between PCR and Sanger results. Using 454 sequencing of  samples with invalid Sanger results revealed a V600E mutation in 14 cases and a V600K mutation in 1 case. Of 11 samples with a WT Sanger result, 454 sequencing detected a V600E mutation in all cases, with a median percentage of mutant alleles of 8%;  ten of the 11 samples had a percentage \u003c 25%. The presence of a V600K mutation was confirmed by 454 sequencing in all 9 samples identified as having V600K mutations by Sanger. Conclusions: 1) the investigational PCR test had a low failure rate; 2) the PCR test was more sensitive in the detection of V600E mutations than Sanger sequencing, which may miss mutations in cases with low % mutant alleles; 3) the PCR test detects V600K mutations, and 4) in all 132 cases, a codon 600 mutation was confirmed by Sanger and/or 454 sequencing. Robust, rapid and accurate molecular testing was achieved in this multi-center clinical trial.","title":"Molecular testing for BRAF V600 mutations in the BRIM-2 trial of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_79170-102"}
