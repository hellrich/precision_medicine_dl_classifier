In the present study, we examined the effect of resveratrol (3,4\u0027,5-trihydroxystilbene), a phytoestrogen found in the skins of most grapes, on oxidative DNA damage in male and female stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). 2. Five-week-old male and female SHRSP were divided into control and resveratrol groups. The resveratrol group was given 1 mg/kg per day, orally, resveratrol by gastric intubation once a day. 3. Following an 8 week feeding period, the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), produced from deoxyguanosine under conditions of oxidative stress, in the urine of male and female resveratrol-treated SHRSP were significantly lower than that in control SHRSP. 4. The urine of resveratrol-treated male and female SHRSP had lower levels of hydroperoxide compared with control SHRSP, but the difference was not significant. 5. Treatment with resveratrol resulted in a 25 and 30% reduction in plasma glycated albumin in male and female SHRSP, respectively, compared with controls. 6. Gender differences for SHRSP with regard to 8-OHdG, hydroperoxide and glycated albumin levels were not confirmed, resveratrol having similar protective effects on male and female SHRSP. 7. These results indicate that dietary resveratrol: (i) plays a role in suppressing oxidative DNA damage and glycoxidative stress in vivo; and (ii) has similar protective effects in both male and female SHRSP, suggesting that the direct effects of this phytoestrogen on oxidative stress in vivo are not sexually dimorphic.","title":"Protective effect of resveratrol on oxidative damage in male and female stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.","pubmedId":"11153537"}
