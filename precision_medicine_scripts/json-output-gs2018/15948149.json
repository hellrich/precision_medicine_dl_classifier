We calculated familial standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for prostate cancers and other cancers in family members.\nSIRs for prostate cancer were increased in sons when mothers were diagnosed with breast and ovarian cancers, and when siblings were diagnosed with Hodgkins disease (1.78, N \u003d 18, 95% CI 1.05-2.82) and leukemia (1.39, 43, 1.01-1.88). Liver cancer and melanoma were also in excess in the high-risk families.\nThe present analysis, the largest yet carried out, found many novel associations implying familial links between prostate cancer and other sites.","title":"Familial association of prostate cancer with other cancers in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database.","pubmedId":"15948149"}
