IL-12 and GM-CSF have differential roles in the antitumor immune response, as IL-12 targets T, NK and natural killer T (NKT) cells and GM-CSF principally targets antigen-presenting cells (APCs). To strengthen the therapeutic efficacy of these two cytokines, we generated an oncolytic adenovirus (Ad), Ad-ΔB7/IL12/GMCSF, coexpressing IL-12 and GM-CSF. Using a murine B16-F10 syngeneic tumor model, we show that Ad-ΔB7/IL12/GMCSF promoted antitumor responses and increased survival compared with an oncolytic Ad expressing IL-12 or GM-CSF alone (Ad-ΔB7/IL12 or Ad-ΔB7/GMCSF, respectively). By measuring cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity and interferon-γ production, we show that the enhanced therapeutic effect was mediated by the induction of immune cell cytotoxicity. In situ delivery of Ad-ΔB7/IL12/GMCSF resulted in massive infiltration of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, NK cells and CD86(+) APCs into the tissue surrounding the necrotic area of the tumor. Moreover, GM-CSF effectively promoted antitumor immune memory, which was significantly augmented by IL-12. Lastly, IL12-expressing oncolytic Ads prevented tumor-induced thymic atrophy and was associated with reduced apoptosis and increased proliferation in the thymus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that an oncolytic Ad coexpressing IL-12 and GM-CSF is a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of cancer.","title":"Strengthening of antitumor immune memory and prevention of thymic atrophy mediated by adenovirus expressing IL-12 and GM-CSF.","pubmedId":"21993173"}
