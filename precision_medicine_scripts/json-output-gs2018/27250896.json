The majority of patients will require a second-line therapy after progression during first-line treatment. While treatment for NSCLC with EGFR mutation or EML4/ALK fusion, target therapy is the favored second-line therapy if not already used in first-line therapy, NSCLC with EGFR wild-type remains an unmet need and many oncologists favor cytotoxic therapy. Recently, a better understanding of lung cancer biology, with a better selection of patients based on histology, molecular biology and the identification of potential target antigens in the immune system have significantly improved patient outcome. This article will provide an update on different treatment options available for patients with EGFR wild-type advanced NSCLC who relapse after first-line therapy, which includes essentially ramucirumab, vandetanib, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab and considerations that may allow clinicians to a better choice of agent for second-line therapy.
