Although bone metastases have been reported frequently, the authors are aware of only a single report of intra-articular synovial metastasis. A case of metastatic melanoma, mimicking degenerative medial meniscal tear of the right knee, is presented. Further examination revealed asymptomatic metastases in the liver, subcutaneous tissue, and left trochanter minor. Arthroscopic examination revealed widespread synovial metastasis and a palliative arthroscopic synovectomy was performed.","title":"Intra-articular metastatic melanoma of the right knee.","pubmedId":"10024041"}
