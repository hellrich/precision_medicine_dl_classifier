This may be attributed to additional genomic alterations that accumulate during disease progression. We sought to identify such lesions in patients showing suboptimal response to IM by performing array-CGH analysis on 39 sequential samples from 15 CML patients. Seventy-four cumulative copy number alterations (CNAs) consisting of 35 losses and 39 gains were identified. Alterations flanking the ABL1 and BCR genes on chromosomes 9 and 22, respectively, were the most common identified lesions with 5 patients losing variable portions of 9q34.11 proximal to ABL1. Losses involving 1p36, 5q31, 17q25, Y and gains of 3q21, 8q24, 22q11, Xp11 were among other recurrent lesions identified. Aberrations were also observed in individual patients, involving regions containing known leukemia-associated genes; CDKN2A/2B, IKZF1, RB1, TLX1, AFF4. CML patients in late stages of their disease, harbor pre-existing and evolving sub-microscopic CNAs that may influence disease progression and IM response.","title":"Identification of copy number alterations by array comparative genomic hybridization in patients with late chronic or accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib mesylate.","pubmedId":"21387093"}
