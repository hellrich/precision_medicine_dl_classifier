It has oncogenic functions in a number of tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and neuroblastoma when altered by translocation or amplification or mutation. On August 2011, a small molecule inhibitor against ALK, crizotinib, was approved for therapy against NSCLC with ALK translocations. As we determine the molecular heterogeneity of tumors, the potential of ALK as a relevant therapeutic target in a number of malignancies has become apparent. This review will discuss some of the tumor types with oncogenic ALK alterations. The activity and unique toxicities of crizotinib are described, along with potential mechanisms of resistance and new therapies beyond crizotinib.","title":"Targeting ALK: a promising strategy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma, and neuroblastoma.","pubmedId":"22968692"}
