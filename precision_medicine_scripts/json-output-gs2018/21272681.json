Although the debate over the extent of thyroidectomy has largely faded, the role of elective neck dissection in the surgical management of papillary thyroid cancer has become a topic of contention. The current standard of care for patients with papillary thyroid cancer includes total thyroidectomy and a therapeutic lymph node dissection for patients presenting with clinically evident nodal disease. However, many surgeons advocate prophylactic central neck lymph node dissections in patients who present with no clinical or radiographic evidence of lymph node involvement. Proponents of prophylactic central compartment neck dissection argue that the incidence of central neck metastases is high and the sensitivity of preoperative ultrasound is low. Furthermore, central neck dissection advocates argue that clearing the central neck at the initial operation improves staging accuracy, assists in deciding on postoperative radioactive iodine treatment, and potentially avoids a higher-risk reoperative central neck dissection. Selective lateral neck dissections, as well as modified radical neck dissections, are accepted as necessary therapy in patients with clinically or radiographically positive lateral compartment disease. An essential component of any discussion on the extent of lymphadenectomy is whether patients derive any additional benefit from having a lymphadenectomy with total thyroidectomy and whether this can be done without significantly increasing the morbidity of the operation. Here we discuss the surgical options for approaching lymphadenectomy in patients presenting with papillary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"Lymph node dissection in papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"21272681"}
