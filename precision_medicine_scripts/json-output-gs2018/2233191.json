Forearm BMC was measured using single photon absorptiometry at proximal (shaft) and distal sites on the radius. Dual photon absorptiometry was used to measure BMC at the lumbar vertebrae (L2-4) and femur at the femoral neck, Ward\u0027s triangle, and greater trochanter. Fat-free body mass (FFBM) was estimated from densitometry. Body builders had greater BMC than swimmers, collegiate runners, recreational runners, and controls. Mean differences in BMC among runners, swimmers, and controls were not significant (P less than or equal to 0.05). FFBM was correlated significantly with BMC (r \u003d 0.35-0.56) at each site in the combined group of athletes (N \u003d 39), whereas total body weight and BMC were correlated significantly at the distal radius site (r \u003d 0.38) only. The results suggest that weight training may provide a better stimulus for increasing BMC than run and swim training.","title":"Bone mineral content of cyclically menstruating female resistance and endurance trained athletes.","pubmedId":"2233191"}
