Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive (+) OSC has a superior prognosis independent of treatment. Among HPV+ patients (pt), current or prior smokers (CS) have poor OS compared with NS. Expression of p16, a known HPV surrogate, and CYD1, a cell cycle marker often dysregulated in HNC, was evaluated with respect to smoking status and OS.  Methods:   Expression of p16 and CYD1 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 108 OSC pt treated between 1999-2009, using cutoffs of 70% (p16+) and 10% (CYD1+) stained tumor cells. Associations between expression, clinical characteristics and OS were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log rank test. Hazard ratio (HR) for death was estimated using Cox models.   Results:   31 pt (28.7%) were p16+ and 80 pt (75.5%) were CYD1 negative(-). p16+ pt were younger (median age 57 v 66 yrs, p\u003d0.002), more likely female (35.5% v 15.2%, p\u003d0.035), NS (51.6% v 13.9%, p\u003c0.001) with lower combined age-comorbidity score (ageCS) (p\u003d0.003).  CYD1+ pt were older (median 66 v 57 yrs, p\u003d0.015), more likely CS (81.5% v 48.1%, p\u003d0.002) with higher ageCS (p\u003d0.018). At a median f/u of 65.7 months, median OS was 57.3 months. p16+ pt had better OS than p16- pt (median OS not reached (NR) v 22.3 mths, p\u003c0.001). CYD1+ pt had poorer OS than CYD1- pt (median OS NR v 17.7 mths, p\u003c0.001). On multivariable analysis p16 and CYD1 status were independently associated with OS (HR 0.412, p\u003d0.045 and HR 4.06, p\u003d0.011 respectively), independent of smoking status (HR 5.01, p\u003d0.008), ageCS (HR 1.32 per 1 point increase, p\u003c0.001) and stage. Strikingly, among NS, 5-year OS in p16+ compared with p16- pt was 100% vs 67% (p\u003c0.001). In contrast, among CS, p16 status had no association with OS (HR 0.97, p\u003d0.943), while CYD1 status and ageCS were independent predictors of death (HR 4.70, p\u003d0.025 and HR 1.28, p\u003c0.001 respectively).  Conclusions:   In OSC, NS with high p16 expression have excellent prognosis. Among CS, pt with fewer comorbidities and low CYD1 expression have better OS. p16 status was not prognostic in the latter group of patients.","title":"Association of smoking status with p16 and cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression with clinical characteristics and overall survival (OS) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_95189-114"}
