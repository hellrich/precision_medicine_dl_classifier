In this study, we investigated the sensitization of B16 mouse melanoma tumors to paclitaxel by a combination of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors: vatalanib, targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and imatinib, an inhibitor targeting for example, Abl/BCR-ABL, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and stem cell factor receptor c-Kit. C57Bl6/J mice carrying B16/PDGF-BB mouse melanoma tumors were treated daily with vatalanib (25 mg/kg), imatinib (100 mg/kg), or a combination of these drugs. Paclitaxel was given subcutaneously twice during the study. The effects of the drugs on tumor cell proliferation in vitro were determined by counting cells. B16/PDGF-BB mouse melanoma tumors were not sensitive to paclitaxel at doses of either 5 or 20 mg/kg. However, the tumor growth was significantly reduced by 58%, in response to paclitaxel (5 mg/kg) when administered with daily doses of both vatalanib and imatinib. Paclitaxel only inhibited the in-vitro growth of B16/PDGF-BB tumor cells when given in combination with imatinib. Imatinib presumably targets c-Kit, as the cells do not express platelet-derived growth factor receptor and as another c-Abl inhibitor was without effect. This was supported by data from three c-Kit-expressing human melanoma cell lines showing varying sensitization to paclitaxel by the kinase inhibitors. In addition, small interfering RNA knockdown of c-Kit sensitized the cells to paclitaxel. These data show that combination of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and vatalanib, increases the effects of paclitaxel on B16/PDGF-BB tumors, thus suggesting a novel strategy for the treatment of melanomas expressing c-Kit.
