The role of c-KIT signaling in melanoma has been controversial; although c-KIT activity is critical to melanocyte development, its expression tends to be lost in most melanomas. Some reports have even shown that the re-expression of c-KIT induces apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. The recent publication of work showing the presence of activating c-KIT mutations in acral and mucosal melanomas, as well as melanomas arising on skin with chronic sun damage, has renewed interest in c-KIT signaling in melanoma. Recent work from our own laboratory has further identified melanomas with constitutive c-KIT signaling activity resulting from c-KIT receptor overexpression. Although the initial clinical trials of the c-KIT inhibitor imatinib mesylate in melanoma were negative, some dramatic responses have been seen in patients with very high c-KIT expression and/or documented activating mutations, fostering the belief that focused studies in patients selected on the basis of c-KIT mutational status will yield more encouraging results. The current review discusses the role of c-KIT signaling in melanoma progression and how this new information can be applied to the targeted therapy of melanoma.","title":"c-KIT signaling as the driving oncogenic event in sub-groups of melanomas.","pubmedId":"19283671"}
