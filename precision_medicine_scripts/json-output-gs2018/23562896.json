Excision biopsy of a lump in the lower outer quadrant revealed adenoid cystic carcinoma. A right sided modified radical mastectomy (MRM) was performed, with axillary clearance. Histopathology revealed a fibroadenoma accounting for one mass and adenoid cystic carcinoma in another, confirmed on Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Three out of the eight excised axillary lymph nodes contained malignancy. There was no evidence of recurrence or distant spread at follow-up 6 months postoperatively.\nACC of the breast is a rare neoplasm accounting for 0.1% of breast carcinomas and is of special interest because of its favourable prognosis and distinctive histological appearance. This tumor occurs predominantly in women in their sixth decade and usually presents as a tender breast mass, often in the subareolar area though in our case it was not tender and presented as multiple lumps in the right breast. The diagnosis can be made on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), but in our case FNAC was inconclusive. We performed MRM with axillary clearance, and three out eight lymph nodes proved positive for malignancy.\nACC is a rare malignant neoplasm. Surgical treatment is the mainstay with little role for radiotherapy and chemotherapy according to the published literature.","title":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of female breast: A case report.","pubmedId":"23562896"}
