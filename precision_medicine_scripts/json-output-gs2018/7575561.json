A novel mutation (1998insCCTCT) was found in exon 12b. The 5-bp duplication comprising nucleotides 1994 to 1998 is predicted to lead to a truncated protein product lacking three quarters of its C-terminal sequence including the entire GTPase-activating protein-(GAP)-related domain. This mutation is associated with a reduction by 50% of the detectable amount of neurofibromin found in this patient. Despite the reduced level of neurofibromin cellular GAP activity was normal, which suggests that defects in other functions of the neurofibromin molecule may be important in the pathogenesis of NF1.","title":"Reduced neurofibromin content but normal GAP activity in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 caused by a five base pair duplication in exon 12b of the NF1 gene.","pubmedId":"7575561"}
