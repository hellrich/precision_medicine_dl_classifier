The system is based on four different FLT3 inhibitors, namely midostaurin, sorafenib, lestaurtinib, and quizartinib, which were independently loaded onto gelatin-coated gold nanoparticles. Detailed investigation of the physicochemical properties of the formed complexes lead to the selection of quizartinib-loaded AuNPs for the in vitro evaluation of the biological effects of the formed complex against OCI-AML3 acute myeloid leukemia cells. Viability tests by MTT demonstrated that the proposed drug complex has improved efficacy when compared with the drug alone. The obtained results constitute a premise for further in vivo investigation of such drug vehicles based on AuNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the delivery of the above-mentioned FLT3 inhibitors via gelatin-coated gold nanoparticles.
