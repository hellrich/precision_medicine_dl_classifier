The underlying disease triggering DIC usually determines the clinical presentation. However, patients with chronic DIC (compensated DIC) may possess subclinical signs and symptoms, and the bleeding disorder may only be identified through laboratory findings. In this compensated form, the triggering factor is exposed slowly and in small amounts (seen in malignancies and vasculitis), allowing replenishing of the augmented factors by the liver, adequate reticuloendothelial clearance of fibrin degradation products, and increased production of platelets, which prevent secondary fibrinolysis and the signs of bleeding. 1,4 We report a case of an 82-year-old male who presented to the emergency room 24 hours after a routine dental extraction with bleeding from the tooth socket, severe hypotension, and presence of ecchymosis on his chest. Clinical and radiographic exam revealed multiple thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms, as well as infrarenal and iliac aneurysms, continuous oral hemorrhage, and a unique presentation rarely documented in the literature: a bleeding tooth socket as the initial clinical sign and presentation of DIC.","title":"Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy: manifestations after a routine dental extraction.","pubmedId":"15772592"}
