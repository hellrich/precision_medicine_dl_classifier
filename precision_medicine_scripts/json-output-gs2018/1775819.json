Because of its rarity, this disease has not been as extensively studied as its female counterpart. Male breast cancer is evaluated and managed in a fashion very similar to that for female breast cancer. Primary management in early stage disease is usually a modified radical mastectomy. First line hormonal therapy for metastatic disease, in our institution, is tamoxifen for patients with positive estrogen receptors. Second line therapy consists of progestins or antiandrogens/LHRH analogs. No firm recommendations can be made concerning adjuvant systemic therapy. However, it is likely that studies from female patients are adaptable. Unfortunately, carcinoma of the male breast is such an infrequently encountered tumor that unfamiliarity with the disease can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment. An increased awareness of the disease may be expected to result in earlier detection and institution of therapy at a stage when cure may be possible.","title":"Male breast cancer.","pubmedId":"1775819"}
