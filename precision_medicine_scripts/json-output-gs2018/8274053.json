According to 125I-EGF binding assay, the amount of EGF receptor was found to vary from 6 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(7) (sites/cell). Changes in EGF-stimulated tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity almost paralleled changes in the number of EGF receptors per cell. Amplification of EGF receptor gene was detected in only one cell line. Under monolayer culture conditions, we found three types of growth responses of esophageal cell lines to EGF; growth in 5 cell lines was inhibited and that in 4 cell lines was stimulated while that in the other 7 cell lines remained unaffected. Relation was observed between the number of EGF receptors per cell and the growth response to EGF. On the other hand, cell lines whose growth was inhibited by EGF in monolayer culture were stimulated by EGF in soft agar culture, though the opposite was not necessarily true.","title":"Relation of epidermal growth factor receptor concentration to growth of human esophageal cancer cell lines.","pubmedId":"8274053"}
