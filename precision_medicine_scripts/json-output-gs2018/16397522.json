In order to evaluate the candidacy for genetic testing of CDKN2A mutations among melanoma prone families, it is important to identify characteristics that predict a high likelihood of carrying a CDKN2A mutation. We primarily used a unique Utah genealogical resource to identify independent melanoma prone families whom we tested for mutations in CDKN2A, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and alternate reading frame. We sampled 60 families which met the inclusion criteria of two or more affected first-degree relatives. We found four different pathogenic CDKN2A mutations in five families, mutations of uncertain significance in two families, and known polymorphisms in three families. One of the mutations of uncertain significance, 5\u0027 untranslated region -25C\u003eT, has not been previously described. Among our population-based set of Utah families, the prevalence of CDKN2A mutations was 8.2% (4/49); the overall prevalence when physician-referred pedigrees were also considered was between 8.3% (5/60) and 10% (6/60). Having four or more first- or second-degree relatives with melanoma, or a family member with \u003e or \u003d3 primary melanomas, correlated strongly with carrying a CDKN2A mutation. We observed a significantly elevated rate of pancreatic cancer in one of four families with a deleterious CDKN2A mutation.","title":"Population-based prevalence of CDKN2A mutations in Utah melanoma families.","pubmedId":"16397522"}
