This study was designed to compare the incidence and prognostic value of ErbB-2 (HER-2/neu) and P-ErbB-2 immunoexpression in archival breast cancer samples.\nEight hundred sixteen invasive breast cancers with a median of 16.3 years of follow-up were immunostained for ErbB-2 (using antibody CB11) and P-ErbB-2 (using antibody PN2A). ErbB-2 and P-ErbB-2 data were compared with clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical, and outcome variables.\nOf 816 primary breast cancers, 307 (38%) were positive for ErbB-2 and 37 (12% of ErbB-2 positive and 5% of the study population) expressed P-ErbB-2. P-ErbB-2 was not detected in ErbB-2-negative cases (n \u003d 509). ErbB-2 immunohistochemical data were bimodal; patients with \u003e or \u003d 80% cellular expression had the shortest disease-free and disease-specific survival. P-ErbB-2 was associated with a higher percentage of ErbB-2-positive cells, a higher number of positive lymph nodes, and cellular proliferation. ErbB-2 and P-ErbB-2 were indicators of poor prognosis in node-positive patients in both univariate and multivariate analyses. We found that either P-ErbB-2 expression or high (\u003e or \u003d 80%) ErbB-2 expression provided the most significant prognostic value in node-positive cases by multivariate analyses. There were too few P-ErbB-2-positive cases and events in the node-negative patient group to allow statistical analysis of P-ErbB-2 in that subgroup.\nPN2A immunostaining identified a subset (approximately 12% of ErbB-2-positive breast cancers) with activation (phosphorylation) of the receptor ErbB-2. P-ErbB-2 expression was strongly associated with higher levels of ErbB-2 expression (\u003e or \u003d 80%), although it was not a surrogate. Identification of cases with a high percentage of invasive breast cancer cells expressing ErbB-2 or determination of receptor activation via P-ErbB-2 may provide additional prognostic value in node-positive breast cancers.","title":"Activation (tyrosine phosphorylation) of ErbB-2 (HER-2/neu): a study of incidence and correlation with outcome in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"10986055"}
