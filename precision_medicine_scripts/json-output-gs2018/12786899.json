Diagnosis depends on finding features similar to adenoma but with an infiltrative growth pattern and exclusion of adenoid cystic carcinoma, sialoblastoma and basaloid squamous carcinoma. Basal cell adenocarcinoma is very rarely reported in minor salivary glands. We report three cases of basal cell adenocarcinoma affecting the labial, buccal and palatal minor salivary glands. One recurred following complete removal but with lesional disruption and further local wide excision appeared curative. A further lesion failed to recur in 5 years\u0027 follow-up despite marginal excision and a third after 3 years\u0027 follow-up. Basal cell adenocarcinoma is considered a low-grade malignancy, and in the minor glands wide excision and radiotherapy are recommended. However, the reported lesions appear to have a more indolent behaviour than previously reported lesions in minor glands.","title":"Basal cell adenocarcinoma in minor salivary glands.","pubmedId":"12786899"}
