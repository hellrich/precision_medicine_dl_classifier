Hematologic workup revealed disseminated intravascular coagulation with isolated left orbital hemorrhage. A canthotomy and blood product transfusions failed to control the bleeding and restore vision. Operative intervention found a new left orbital roof metastasis from primary prostatic carcinoma. Acute onset of headache or ocular pain in patients with metastatic prostate cancer warrants further workup to rule out orbital and intracranial metastases, rare but significant clinical entities that can lead to severe complications.
