Optimal selection of PAC patients for genetic testing remains to be determined.  Our objective was to investigate prevalence of germline mutations in our PAC patients.  Methods:  MSKCC Clinical Genetics database was reviewed for PAC patients offered germline testing from 1/1/2011 to present.  Clinical data was extracted from records.  Pedigrees were reviewed to verify NCCN (PAC at any age with 2 close relatives with breast/ovarian/PAC at any age) and/or other testing criteria.  Results:  70 PAC patients (33 males, 40 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ)) were seen; 36 met NCCN criteria and 16 were AJ with 1 close relative with breast/ovarian/PAC.  Of 18 not meeting these criteria, 7 were AJ, 3 were early-onset, and 7 were non-AJ with at least 1 additional BRCA-associated cancer in either themselves or a close relative.  63 patients accepted BRCA testing: 6 (9.5%) had a BRCA1 (n\u003d2) or BRCA2 (n\u003d4) mutation.  Only 2 of these met NCCN criteria; 3 were AJ with 1 close relative with a BRCA-associated cancer; and 1 was non-AJ descent with 1 close relative with early-onset breast cancer.  36 AJ patients pursued BRCA testing: 4 (11.1%) had a BRCA1 (n\u003d1) or BRCA2 (n\u003d3) mutation; all were founder mutations.  Additional genetic testing, based on family history, identified 1 MSH2 mutation, 1 MSH6 mutation, and 1 p16 mutation.  Overall mutation detection rates were 13.6% (9/66) in total cohort who pursued any genetic testing and 15.8% (6/38) in tested AJ group.  6 patients with PAC before age 50 were tested: 1 non-AJ patient had a BRCA1 mutation and 1 (with history of melanoma) had a p16 mutation.  Conclusions:  With mutation detection rates of nearly 14% in total tested population \u0026 16% in AJ cohort, germline genetic testing is important for PAC patients with potential implications for treatment and for relatives.  By limiting BRCA testing to patients who meet current NCCN testing criteria, 66.7% (4/6) of our patients with BRCA mutations would not have been identified.  Reassessment of testing criteria is needed for optimal care of PAC patients.","title":"Identification of germline genetic mutations in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_105769-133"}
