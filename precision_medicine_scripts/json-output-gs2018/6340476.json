Each of these individual reproductive events represents the sum of many systemic, local, cellular, and molecular interactions. All of these processes have varying degrees of susceptibility to interference by xenobiotic compounds. This chapter presents a brief review of some of these mechanisms of female reproductive biology.","title":"Female reproduction.","pubmedId":"6340476"}
