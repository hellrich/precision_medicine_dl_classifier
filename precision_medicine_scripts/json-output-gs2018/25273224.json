Among the 733 cases tested for all 10 genes, BRAF mutations were more likely to occur than most other genotypic abnormalities in current or former smokers (BRAF vs sensitizing EGFR, 82% vs 36%, mid-P \u003c .001; BRAF vs ALK, 39%, mid-P \u003d .003; BRAF vs other mutations, 49%, mid-P \u003d .02; BRAF vs patients with more than 1 oncogenic driver [doubleton], 46%, mid-P \u003d .04.) The double-mutation rate was 16% among patients with BRAF mutations but 5% among patients with other genomic abnormalities (mid-P \u003d .045). Differences were not found in survival between patients with BRAF mutations and those with other genomic abnormalities (P \u003e .20).\nBRAF mutations occurred in 2.2% of advanced-stage lung adenocarcinomas, were most commonly V600E, and were associated with distinct clinicopathologic features in comparison with other genomic subtypes and with a high mutation rate in more than 1 gene. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive genomic profiling in assessing patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas.","title":"Clinicopathologic features and outcomes of patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring BRAF mutations in the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium.","pubmedId":"25273224"}
