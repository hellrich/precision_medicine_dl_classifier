The best described of these are mutations in Fms-like  tyrosine kinase 3, nucleophosmin 1, and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-alpha in those with cytogenetically AML, which allow more accurate risk stratification and help better \u0027target\u0027 patients who may benefit from allogeneic transplantation (specifically those with activating FLT3  mutation). Among the new targets identified for clinical trials are FLT3 mutation (a target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors), CD33 expression (a target of monoclonal antibodies and immunotoxins), aberrant methylation (target of hypomethylating agents), and overexpression of the chemokine receptor  CXCR4 (a target for inhibition by small molecule or monoclonal antibody). We are advancing towards an era of personalized medicine in AML, and can now better identify specific patients who may benefit from specific therapies with less toxicity.","title":"Targeted therapy of acute myeloid leukemia in 2012: towards individualized therapy.","pubmedId":"22507802"}
