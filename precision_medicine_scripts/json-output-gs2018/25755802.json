Primary tumors of squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma involving the skin of the head and neck have the potential to spread to lymph nodes of the parotid gland. Metastatic malignant melanoma to the back was exceptionally rare and no such reports have been noted in the literature. We reported an exceptional case of intraparotid lymph nodes metastasis of the right scalp junctional nevus with malignant transformation to malignant melanoma in a 48-year-old man. The patient presented with a mass in the parotid gland area, which was misdiagnosed as a primary parotid tumor and surgical removal was performed. Unfortunately, recurrence with newly developed metastatic lesions in the back and cervical lymph nodes occurred 1 year after initial surgical management. This case is presented highlighting the unusual features of metastatic junctional nevus with malignant transformation to malignant melanoma of intraparotid lymph nodes, cervical lymph nodes and the back, which should help us to reduce misdiagnosis and obtain the best results.
