Cytochemical, histologic, and cytogenetic studies helped in the distinction from a recently described entity: acute myeloid leukemia with marrow basophilia. Although the leukemia responded well to aggressive chemotherapy, the mastocytosis component worsened, illustrating the inherent resistance of mastocytosis to chemotherapy.","title":"Concurrent acute myeloid leukemia and systemic mastocytosis.","pubmedId":"1951328"}
