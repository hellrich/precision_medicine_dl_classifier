During the laparotomy, a leiomyoblastoma and multiple leiomyomas, which were histologically diagnosed as such later, were found in the small intestine and resected. It is quite possible that the association of gastrointestinal leiomyomas and NF1 is more than coincidental. It is thus important to take this complication into account in clinical treatment of patients with NF1.","title":"Leiomyoblastoma and leiomyomatosis of the small intestine in a case of von Recklinghausen\u0027s disease.","pubmedId":"9065708"}
