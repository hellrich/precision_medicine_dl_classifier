Perifosine could potently inhibit thyroid cancer cell growth when used alone, but a strong antagonism occurred between this drug and PLX4032 or AZD6244 in the inhibition of thyroid cancer cell growth with all combination index values higher than 1. Combinations of MK2206 with PLX4032 or AZD6244 dramatically enhanced G1 cell cycle arrest induced by each drug alone. However, G2 cell cycle arrest uniquely induced by perifosine alone and G1 cell cycle arrest induced by PLX4032 or AZD6244 were both reversed by combination treatments, providing a mechanism for their antagonism. All these drugs could correspondingly inhibit the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signalings, confirming their expected target effects.\nWe demonstrated, unexpectedly, opposite outcomes of MK2206 and perifosine in their combinational treatments with BRAF(V600E)/MEK inhibitors in thyroid cancer cells. The data may help appropriate selection of these prominent drugs for clinical trials of combination therapies for thyroid cancer.","title":"The Akt inhibitor MK2206 synergizes, but perifosine antagonizes, the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4032 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 in the inhibition of thyroid cancer cells.","pubmedId":"22090271"}
