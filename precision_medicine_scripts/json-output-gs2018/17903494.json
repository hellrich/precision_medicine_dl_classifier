Univariate analyses were performed by the log-rank test to determine predictors of survival, and multivariable analysis was performed by a Cox regression model.\nOverall 5-year survival was 58%. On univariate analysis, tumor size, gender, age, and extent of resection were significant predictors of survival. Five-year survival of patients with tumors 2.1 to 3.0 cm was lower than that for patients with tumors 2.0 cm or smaller: 55% versus 60% (P \u003c .0001). Men faired significantly worse than women, with a 5-year survival of 53% versus 63% (P \u003c .0001). Patients older than the median age of 67 years had worse 5-year survival than had those under the median age: 52% versus 65% (P \u003c .0001). Patients undergoing sublobar resections showed poorer 5-year survival than patients undergoing anatomic resections: 44% versus 61% (P \u003c .0001). On multivariable analysis with a Cox regression model, all 4 variables remained statistically significant.\nThe survival of patients with stage IA non-small cell lung cancer within the United States is significantly worse than survival reported from single-institution studies. This study identifies 4 factors that may affect survival in resected stage IA non-small cell lung cancer: tumor size, gender, age, and extent of resection.","title":"Factors predicting poor survival after resection of stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"17903494"}
