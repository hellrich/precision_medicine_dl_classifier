We performed allelotyping at loci containing the candidate genes FGFR-1-2-3-4, FGF-1-2-7-10, c-Met and HGF in 36 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (20 squamous-cell carcinomas (SQC) and 16 adenocarcinomas (ADC)), by surrounding each locus with two microsatellites (MS), as close as possible to the genes of interest. Unexpectedly, SQC and ADC were frequently altered at all of these loci, and SQC showed more simultaneously altered loci. In ADC, alterations at the 15q13-22 locus (FGF7 candidate gene) were significantly more frequent. Thus, these loci showed different patterns of molecular alterations between SQC and ADC. Finally, alterations at loci containing FGFR and HGF candidate genes were inversely correlated to the lymph node status in SQC and ADC, respectively.","title":"Allelic imbalance at loci containing FGFR, FGF, c-Met and HGF candidate genes in non-small cell lung cancer sub-types, implication for progression.","pubmedId":"14602140"}
