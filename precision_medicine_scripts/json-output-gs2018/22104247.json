We analyzed the prognostic effects and interactions of these mutations in 201 AML-NK patients. NPM1 and FLT3 mutations were found in 38.3 and 24.9% of AML-NK patients, respectively. NPM1 mutations (NPM1mut), especially in patients without FLT3 mutations (FLT3mut), were associated with a favorable outcome. However, NPM1mut did not affect survival. FLT3mut tended to be associated with a poor survival outcome. FLT3mut showed no prognostic effects in patients with A-type NPM1mut. However, FLT3mut were associated with a significantly worse prognosis in patients with non-A-type NPM1mut. The prognostic interaction between the NPM1 and FLT3 mutations was significant in patients with non-A-type NPM1mut.","title":"Clinical implications of non-A-type NPM1 and FLT3 mutations in patients with normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"22104247"}
