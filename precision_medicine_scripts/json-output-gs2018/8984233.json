Mutations have been identified in the extracellular domain of the RET proto-oncogen product (10q11.2) in MEN 2A patients. In each case a single base pair substitution results in replacement of cysteine with another amino acid. Most MEN 2A patients have mutations of codon 634.\nSixty-five unrelated MEN 2A patients from seven families were studied. Polymerase chain reaction, segregation, sequence analysis and restriction enzyme digestion were performed.\nOf seven families, four had the TGC to TAC transition, two families the TGC to TGG transversion and one family the TGC to CGC transition in codon 634 of RET.\nWe found all the mutations in codon 634. The characterization of MEN 2A mutations allows early and presymptomatic diagnosis in this syndrome.","title":"[The molecular pathology of RET protooncogene in families with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A].","pubmedId":"8984233"}
