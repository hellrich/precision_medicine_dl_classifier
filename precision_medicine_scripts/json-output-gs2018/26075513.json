Here, we present the case of a 78-year-old lady with Stewart-Treves syndrome, a rare cutaneous angiosarcoma. The histology showed angiocutaneous sarcoma with poorly defined margins. The prognosis remains extremely poor. A successful transfemoral amputation reduced the massive tumour burden and cleared a source of sepsis from this fungating tumour. Our aim is to highlight this rare but high-grade sarcoma which results from chronic lymphoedema. The red flag signs of sarcoma are masses greater than 5 cm, tumours which are rapidly growing, deep to fascia or painful, and tumours that recur after previous surgery. Non-healing or progressive ulceration in the background of chronic lymphoedema should raise the possibility of underlying malignancy. We need a low threshold for biopsy and early referral to an appropriate multidisciplinary team for the optimum management of the patient.","title":"Stewart-Treves syndrome following idiopathic leg lymphoedema: remember sarcoma.","pubmedId":"26075513"}
