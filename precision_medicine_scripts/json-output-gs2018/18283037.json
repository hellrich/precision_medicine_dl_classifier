Here, we took advantage of a semiquantitative protein array technology to identify intracellular oncogenic kinases that distinctively correlate with breast cancer cell sensitivity/resistance to the dual-HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib (Tykerb(R)).\nMCF-7 cells were forced to overexpress HER2 following stable transduction with pBABE-HER2 retroviruses. The Human Phospho-MAPK Array Proteome Profilertrade mark (R\u0026D Systems) was used to molecularly assess the effects of both the mono-HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab (Herceptintrade mark) and the dual-HER1/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib on 21 different oncogenic kinases. A model of acquired resistance to lapatinib (MCF-7/HER2-Lap10 cells) was established by chronically exposing MCF-7/HER2 cells to increasing concentrations of lapatinib for \u003e10 months.\nTreatment of MCF-7/HER2 cells with either trastuzumab or lapatinib similarly impaired HER2-enhanced activation status (i.e. phosphorylation) of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1-3 and p38alpha/beta/gamma/delta and of the serine/threonine kinases AKT, glycogen synthase kinase-3, p90 ribosomal s6 kinase1/2, and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase1/2. Trastuzumab was less effective than lapatinib at blocking extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and, notably, it failed to deactivate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) effector p70S6K1. Conversely, lapatinib treatment caused a drastic decrease in the phosphorylation of p70S6K1 at ERK1/2-regulated sites (Thr(421)/Ser(424)) and, as a consequence, p70S6K1 activity measured by its phospho-Thr(389) levels was abolished. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was found to supraadditively increase lapatinib efficacy in MCF-7/HER2 cells [ approximately 10-fold enhancement; combination index (CI(50)) \u003d 0.243 \u003c 1.0 \u003d additivity, P \u003c 0.001] but not in p70S6K1 gene-amplified MCF-7 parental cells ( approximately 1.3-fold enhancement; CI(50) \u003d 0.920 congruent with 1.0 \u003d additivity). Lapatinib-resistant MCF-7/HER2-Lap10 cells, which are capable of growing in the continuous presence of 10 microM lapatinib without significant effects on cell viability, notably exhibited a lapatinib-insensitive hyperphosphorylation of p70S6K1. Rapamycin cotreatment suppressed p70S6K1 hyperactivation and synergistically resensitized MCF-7/HER2-Lap10 cells to lapatinib (\u003e20-fold increase in lapatinib-induced cytotoxicity; CI(50) \u003d 0.175 \u003c 1.0 \u003d additivity).\nSerine-threonine kinase p70S6K1, a marker for mTOR activity that regulates protein translation, constitutes a specific biomarker for the biological effects of the dual-HER1/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib. The clinical implications of our data are that the efficacy of lapatinib might be enhanced with therapies that target the mTOR pathway. Rapamycin analogues such as CCI-779 (Temsirolimus) and RAD001 (Everolimus) may warrant further clinical evaluation to effectively delay or prevent the development of acquired resistance to lapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.","title":"Low-scale phosphoproteome analyses identify the mTOR effector p70 S6 kinase 1 as a specific biomarker of the dual-HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib (Tykerb) in human breast carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"18283037"}
