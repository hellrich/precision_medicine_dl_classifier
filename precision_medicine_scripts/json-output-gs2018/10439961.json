We detected this polymorphism in two non-Ashkenazi Jewish women using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and hypothesized that in Jewish individuals it might not be restricted to Ashkenazim, and actually reflect a common ancestral polymorphism. To test this notion we performed allelic pattern determination using APC-linked markers in these two women and in nine Ashkenazi carrier controls. The pattern of the intragenic markers, as well as a single downstream marker 30-70 Kb from the APC gene was identical in all individuals, regardless of ethnic origin. We conclude that the I1307K polymorphism in Jewish individuals, is not restricted to Ashkenazim and probably reflects a founder mutation.","title":"Common origin of the I1307K APC polymorphism in Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews.","pubmedId":"10439961"}
