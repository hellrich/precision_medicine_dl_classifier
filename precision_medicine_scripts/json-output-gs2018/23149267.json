Its uptake and internalization into antigen presenting cells (APCs) is a critical step in gp96-mediated immune responses. This study examined strategies to improve the cell internalization and T cell activation of gp96. It was found that recombinant fusion with the cell-penetrating peptide TAT (trans-activator of transcription) slightly decreased the aggregation level of gp96 and significantly increased its internalization into macrophages. Furthermore, immunization with the TAT-gp96 fusion dramatically enhanced gp96-mediated hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific T cell responses and its antiviral efficiency in HBV transgenic mice compared to rgp96. In addition, the inclusion of TAT significantly improved the antitumor T cell immune response to a gp96 vaccine in the B16 melanoma model. These results provide evidence that the efficient transduction of gp96 into APCs can significantly enhance the outcome of gp96-based immunotherapy, and therefore provide a basis for more efficient approaches to improving the immunoregulatory and adjuvant functions of this unique T cell adjuvant.","title":"TAT-mediated gp96 transduction to APCs enhances gp96-induced antiviral and antitumor T cell responses.","pubmedId":"23149267"}
