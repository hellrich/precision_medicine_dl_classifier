Moreover, PCC includes two different forms: extrahepatic (EH) PCC, which arises from the perihilar EH large ducts, and intrahepatic (IH) PCC, in which a significant liver mass invades the perihilar bile ducts. In this study, we investigated the molecular profile and molecular prognostic factors in EH-PCC, IH-PCC, and ICC submitted to curative surgery.\nNinety-one patients with cholangiocarcinoma (38 EH-PCC, 18 IH-PCC, and 35 ICC), who underwent curative surgery in a single tertiary hepatobiliary surgery referral center were assessed for mutational status in 56 cancer-related genes.\nThe most frequently mutated genes in EH-PCC were KRAS (47.4 %), TP53 (23.7 %) and ARID1A (15.8 %); in IH-PCC were KRAS (22.2 %), PBRM1 (16.7 %), and PIK3CA (16.7 %); and in ICC were IDH1 (17.1 %), NRAS (17.1 %), and BAP1 (14.3 %). The presence of mutations in ALK, IDH1, and TP53 genes was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with EH-PCC (p \u003c 0.001, p \u003d 0.043, and p \u003d 0.019, respectively). Mutation of the TP53 gene was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with IH-PCC (p \u003d 0.049). The presence of mutations in ARID1A, PIK3C2G, STK11, TGFBR2, and TP53 genes was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with ICC (p \u003d 0.012, p \u003d 0.030, p \u003d 0.030, p \u003d 0.011, and p \u003d 0.011, respectively).\nMutational gene profiling identified different gene mutations in EH-PCC, IH-PCC, and ICC. Moreover, our study reported specific prognostic genes that can identify patients with poor prognosis after curative surgery who may benefit from traditional or target adjuvant treatments.","title":"Cholangiocarcinoma Heterogeneity Revealed by Multigene Mutational Profiling: Clinical and Prognostic Relevance in Surgically Resected Patients.","pubmedId":"26717940"}
