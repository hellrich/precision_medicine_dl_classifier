The lack of actionable mutations in NSCLC patients presents a significant hurdle in the administration of targeted therapies for this disease, and their identification is an urgent unmet need. Here we identify somatically mutated ABL1 as a genetic dependency that is required to maintain NSCLC cell survival. We demonstrate that NSCLC cancer cells with ABL1 mutations are sensitive to ABL inhibitors and we verify that the drug-induced effects on cell viability are specific to pharmacological inhibition of the ABL1 kinase. Consistent with structural modeling, we demonstrate that mutations in ABL1 identified in primary NSCLC tumors and a lung cancer cell line increase downstream pathway activation compared to wild-type ABL1. Finally, we show that imatinib suppresses lung tumor growth in vivo, specifically in lung cancer cells harboring a gain-of-function (GOF) mutation in ABL1. In summary, our results suggest that NSCLC patients with ABL1 mutations could be stratified for treatment with imatinib in combination with other therapies.","title":"Mutant ABL1 is a genetic dependency in non-small cell lung cancer amenable to pharmacological intervention","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4408"}
