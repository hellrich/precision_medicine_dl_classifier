We hypothesized that pancreatic CTCs may sequest in the liver and conceived a study to explore CTC number in the peripheral and portal circulations of patients undergoing Whipples surgery.  Methods:     Seventeen patients undergoing Whipples surgery were recruited prospectively after informed written consent. Blood was collected intra-operatively from the portal vein prior to tumor mobilization and from the peripheral circulation.  Paired samples were analysed for CTC number (CellSearch system, Veridex, USA), and M30/M65 biomarkers of cell death.  Results:     Of 17 patients 6 had cholangiocarcinomas and 11 had pancreatic adenocarcinomas (5 inoperable). CTC number in the portal circulation was consistently higher than in the peripheral circulation. All patients with cholangiocarcinoma had no CTCs in the peripheral circulation but two patients had 139 and 21 CTCs in the portal circulation. Five patients with pancreatic carcinoma had no CTCs in the peripheral circulation but 1 CTC in 2 patients, 4 CTCs in 2 patients and 32 and 731 CTCs were seen in 2 other patients in the portal circulation.  Five patients had no CTCs in both circulations and the remaining patient had 1 CTC in the peripheral circulation and 4 CTCs in the portal circulation. Where present, circulating tumour microemboli were detected in the portal circulation only. M65 levels were higher in the portal circulation indicating higher levels of cell death. M30 levels did not differ significantly between circulations but appeared to correlate with portal CTC number.  Conclusions:    This is the first study to enumerate CTCs in peripheral and portal circulations in pancreato-biliary carcinomas.  Higher CTC numbers are present in the portal circulation suggesting CTC sequestration in the liver. Five patients with pancreatic cancer (2 of whom were inoperable) had no CTCs in either circulation, a finding consistent with the poor vascularity and dense stromal characteristics of this carcinoma. Nonetheless the portal circulation may be a potential source for CTC characterisation including genomic analysis to further define tumor biology.","title":"Pancreatic circulating tumor cells: Where are they-","pubmedId":"ASCO_97618-114"}
