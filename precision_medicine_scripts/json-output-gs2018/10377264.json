We furthermore demonstrate that the adapter protein Grb2 is a specific binding partner for both phosphorylated Tyr-703 and phosphorylated Tyr-936, whereas the adapter protein Grb7 binds selectively to phosphorylated Tyr-936. It is shown that the association occurs through the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Grb2 and Grb7. Binding of Grb2 to Tyr-703 in the c-Kit/SCFR provides a link to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.","title":"Identification of Tyr-703 and Tyr-936 as the primary association sites for Grb2 and Grb7 in the c-Kit/stem cell factor receptor.","pubmedId":"10377264"}
