The median overall survival for metastatic colorectal cancer is nearly 2 years. However, there may be survival differences based on site of metastatic disease.\nData was collected from the South Australian Registry for Advanced Colorectal Cancer. A total of 1207 patients with single site metastatic disease at initial diagnosis were subclassified into 6 subgroups: liver only (n \u003d 780), pelvic only (n \u003d 148), lung only (n \u003d 142), lymph node only (n \u003d 95), bone only (n \u003d 32), and brain only (n \u003d 10). Univariate and multivariate parametric survival analyses were performed.\nMedian overall survival was 20.3 months for the whole group. The overall survival for lung-only metastases group was 41.1 months followed by liver- and pelvic-only disease groups (22.8 and 23.8 months, respectively). Patients with isolated bone-only and brain-only metastases had poor overall survival (5.1 and 5.7 months, respectively). On multivariate analysis, prognosis was superior for the lung-only group.\nLung only group had the longest median overall survival. Bone and brain sites had a poor outlook. Site of metastatic disease at initial presentation may be prognostic.","title":"Survival differences in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and with single site metastatic disease at initial presentation: results from South Australian clinical registry for advanced colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"22763194"}
