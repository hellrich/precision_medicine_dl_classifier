The MAb AGF43 reacted with acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and was unreactive against chronic myeloid leukemia cells. A large proportion of AML blasts showing minimal or no differentiation (AML-M1) were intensely labeled by AGF43 in contrast to a smaller percentage of blasts showing partial differentiation (AML-M2 and acute myelomonocytic leukemia). The AGF43 antigen is expressed by bone marrow lymphoid (TdT+) and myeloid (CFU-GM) progenitor cells, 95% of B cells and 65% of T cells in the blood and absent from monocytes. Only 17% of normal myeloblasts were weakly stained by AGF43. Sections of tonsil and spleen were used to confirm that, unlike antibodies to MHC class II antigens, AGF43 stained a majority of T cells and macrophages were unreactive. In conclusion, the MAb AGF43 identifies a new precursor cell antigen. The distribution of this antigen during normal myelopoiesis and on AML cells support the suggestion that acute myeloid leukemias originate in pluripotent or closely related myeloid stem cells.","title":"Antigen shared by human hemopoietic precursor cells and T and B lineage cells.","pubmedId":"6332060"}
