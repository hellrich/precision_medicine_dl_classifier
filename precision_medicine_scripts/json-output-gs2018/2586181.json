Statistical approaches to this data set are described. The study shows sex differences in distribution for those aged under 55 years compared to older age groups, with variable male: female incidence in different age bands and a male excess in those over 55 years. A nonsignificant excess of females was noted in those under 5 years. The rates presented for 1984-1986 are higher than those previously described for England and Wales. Statistically significant variation in incidence was seen both between counties and districts. At electoral ward level regression analyses were suggestive of links between AML and higher social class and living close to estuaries.","title":"The leukaemia research fund data collection survey: the incidence and geographical distribution of acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"2586181"}
