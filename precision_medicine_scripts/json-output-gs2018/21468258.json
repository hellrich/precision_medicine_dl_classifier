The definitive CCRT consisted of a median dose of 54 Gy (range: 40.0-68.4 Gy) and two cycles of concurrent administration of mostly 5-fluorouracil + cisplatinum. High expression of EGFR, VEGF, and COX-2 was found in 79.5%, 31.8%, and 38.6%, respectively. The Cox regression analysis for overall survival (OS) showed that both the treatment response and COX-2 expression were significant. The 3-yr OS rates of patients that achieved a complete response and those that did not were 46.7% and 5.3%, respectively (P \u003d 0.006). The logistic regression analysis for treatment response with various parameters showed that only a high expression of VEGF was significantly associated with a complete response. Unlike other well-known studies, higher expression of VEGF was significantly correlated with a complete response to CCRT in this study. However, higher expression of COX-2 was significantly associated with shorter survival. These results suggest that VEGF might be a predictive factor for treatment response and COX-2 a prognostic factor for OS in patients with ESCC after definitive CCRT.","title":"VEGF as a predictor for response to definitive chemoradiotherapy and COX-2 as a prognosticator for survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"21468258"}
