Laryngeal adenoid cystic carcinomas are rare and account for less than 1% of all malignant tumours in the larynx. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is characterised by slow progression, multiple recurrences and late distant metastasis. The aetiology of adenoid cystic carcinoma remains unknown. They usually originate in the supraglottic or subglottic area. Wide-margin surgery alone or in combination with post-operative radiotherapy is the best tumour management. In this article, the case of laryngeal adenoid cystic carcinoma is described in a 55-year-old male patient who presented with a 3-month history of prelaryngeal pain. The patient underwent total laryngectomy and post-operative radiotherapy. For patients with laryngeal adenoid cystic carcinomas, regular and long-term follow-up is mandatory, in order to detect relapses and metastases.","title":"Laryngeal adenoid cystic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20162031"}
