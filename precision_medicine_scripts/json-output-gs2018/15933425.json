Shortly after completion of therapy, there was progress of the disease on the soft tissue of the right hand, and bone marrow involvement was also found. A fine-needle aspiration of the hand mass was performed, and a diagnosis of CD30+/ALK+ NR-ALCL, was rendered.\nWe studied the morphological characteristics of CD30+/ALK+ NR-ALCL using histological methods. A panel of antibodies were used to establish diagnosis and subtyping. In addition EBV status and molecular cytogenetics were determined.\nALK-ALCL arising in the skin represents a single disease with a broad spectrum of morphology; clinicians and pathologists should be aware of this neutrophil-rich (NR) variant with aggressive clinical presentation.","title":"ALK-positive neutrophil-rich variant of anaplastic large cell lymphoma diagnosed after head trauma.","pubmedId":"15933425"}
