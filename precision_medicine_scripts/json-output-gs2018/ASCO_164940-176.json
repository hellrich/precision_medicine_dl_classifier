{"publicationTypes":["2016 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: Cabazitaxel (CBZ) is registered for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Diarrhea is a common adverse effect, reported in 47% of the patients in the TROPIC trial, with grade 3 or 4 events in 6% of patients (De Bono et al, Lancet 2010). We studied if co-administration of the oral corticosteroid budesonide (BUD) would decrease the incidence and severity of CBZ-induced diarrhea. Previously, we showed that BUD co-administration has no effect on CBZ plasma exposure (de Graan et al, PIII-41, ASCPT 2012). Methods: From Dec 2011 to Oct 2015, we performed a multicenter randomized phase II open-label trial in mCRPC patients [NTR2991]. After written informed consent, patients scheduled to receive standard of care CBZ 25 mg/m2 Q3W plus prednisone 5 mg BID were randomized to receive CBZ plus prednisone alone (control arm) or to receive concomitant BUD 9 mg QD during the first 2 treatment cycles (BUD arm). Patients reported the frequency and consistency of stools in a diary. The primary endpoint was the incidence of grade 2-4 diarrhea. To detect a decrease in incidence from 25% to 10% (2-sided  \u003d 0.05 and  \u003d 0.20) 113 evaluable patients per arm were needed. Results: Of the 246 included patients, 227 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Median number of cycles was 6 for both arms. No grade 4 diarrhea was observed. The incidence of grade 3 diarrhea was 4% in both arms. In the BUD arm, 21 of the 114 patients (18%) had grade 2-3 diarrhea, compared with 14 of the 113 (12%) in the control arm (p \u003d 0.208). Median number of stools per day at baseline was 1 in both arms and was maximally 3 (range 1-40) in the BUD arm and 3 (range 1-13) in the control arm. Two patients in the BUD arm and 5 patients in the control arm were hospitalized for diarrhea. In 3 patients diarrhea was one of the reasons for treatment discontinuation. Main other grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (49%), nausea (1%) and vomiting (1%). Conclusions: BUD had no significant effect on CBZ induced diarrhea. Interestingly, the incidence of grade 3-4 diarrhea was slightly lower than that observed in the TROPIC trial, and diarrhea was never the sole reason for treatment discontinuation.
