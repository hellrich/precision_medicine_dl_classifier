Newer immunosuppression regimens have been successfully evaluated in clinical trials. Particular advances in anesthesia include endorsement of fluid restriction in thoracic surgery, greater use of transesophageal echocardiography, and postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","title":"Lung transplantation.","pubmedId":"17211162"}
