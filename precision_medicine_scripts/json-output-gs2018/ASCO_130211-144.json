In order to identify relevant tumor associated targets of TIL based therapy our study aimed to identify the occurrence of PD-L1 specific T-cells in ex vivo expanded TIL from 30 patients, six of which were head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients and 24 were melanoma patients. The latter include 18 melanoma patients from our ongoing phase II trial NCT00937625.  Methods:  Upon PD-L1 peptide stimulation, TILs were screened for IFNgamma secretion using direct Elispot assays (Mabtech). In addition, PD-L1:tetramer (in house) analysis of TIL from selected patients was  performed identifying PD-L1 specific cytotoxic T-cells. A standard 51Cr-release assay was used to assess killing of T2 cells presenting PD-L1 peptide.  Results:  In five of six HNSCC patients and in 17 of 24 melanoma patients, respectively, functional PD-L1 specific T-cells were identified in ex vivo expanded TIL, as determined by IFNgamma release. Moreover, it should be noted, PD-L1 responses were detected in four of five clinical responders (PR/CR), but in only two of five non-responders (SD/PD). Sequential analysis of specific binding to PD-L1:tetramers and the killing of PD-L1 presenting T2 cells confirmed the PD-L1 derived epitopes as a valid immunogenic target.  Conclusions:  These data demonstrate that counter immune inhibitory effector T-cells are present in tumors of different origin, and that they have the potential to effectively engage PD-L1, a known potent antitumor immune inhibitor. These findings may lead to the notion that effective immunotherapeutic approaches rely on the presence of effector T-cells specifically targeting both tumor and endogenous immune inhibitory pathways.","title":"PD-L1 specific tumor infiltrating lymphocytes occur frequently in melanoma and HNSCC patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_130211-144"}
