To molecularly characterize T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta transcripts of clone 8B3, sequence analysis of several cDNA isolates was carried out. Such analysis indicated that the functional alpha and beta chain of 8B3 are composed of V alpha 2.1/J alpha/C alpha and V beta 8.2/D beta/J beta 1.2/C beta 1 gene segments. Eleven additional melanoma-reactive T cell clones from the same patient (one MHC-restricted and 10 MHC-unrestricted) were analysed for usage of the 8B3 V alpha 2 and V beta 8 gene segments by Northern blot hybridization. Neither the V alpha 2 nor the V beta 8 segments were used by 8D9, the second MHC-restricted melanoma-specific TIL clone that displayed intra-tumour reactivity identical to that of 8B3 recognizing only 4 out of 25 melanoma clones isolated from the same metastases. No V beta 8 expression was found among the MHC-unrestricted T cell clones and all but two (found in duplicate as 4C4 and 4A6) were also negative for V alpha 2 expression. Southern blot analysis revealed different TCR beta chain rearrangements in most MHC-unrestricted T cell clones providing evidence of their independent derivation. Taken together these findings show that TCR of clone 8B3 is unique in composition and not shared by MHC-unrestricted melanoma-reactive T cell clones. The different set of V alpha and V beta families used by clone 8D9 further indicates that the TCR usage in the specific and MHC-restricted response to melanoma can be polyclonal.","title":"Two autologous melanoma-specific and MHC-restricted human T cell clones with identical intra-tumour reactivity do not share the same TCR V alpha and V beta gene families.","pubmedId":"1668534"}
