Systemic chemotherapy and biological treatments remain unsatisfactory. This study investigated the impact of hepatic arterial chemotherapy in patients with ocular and cutaneous melanoma.\nIn a retrospectively analysed observational study, 36 consecutive patients with hepatic metastases from ocular or cutaneous melanoma were assigned for surgical hepatic port-catheter implantation. Fotemustine was delivered weekly for a 4-week period, followed by a 5-week rest and a maintenance period every 3 weeks until progression. Overall survival, response and toxicity were analysed and compared.\nAfter port-catheter implantation 30/36 patients were finally treated (18 with ocular and 12 with cutaneous melanoma). A median of 8 infusions per patient were delivered (range 3-24). 30% thrombocytopenia grade \u003eor\u003d3, 7% neutropenia grade \u003eor\u003d3 but no nausea or vomiting grade \u003eor\u003d3 were encountered. Nine out of 30 patients achieved partial remission, 10/30 stable disease; 11/30 patients were progressive. Median survival for all treated patients was 14 months. Partial remission and stable disease were associated with a survival advantage compared to progressive disease (19 vs. 5 months). No significant difference in survival was observed for ocular versus cutaneous melanoma. Serum LDH was a significant predictor of both response and survival.\nHepatic arterial Fotemustine chemotherapy was well tolerated. Meaningful response and survival rates were achieved in ocular as well as cutaneous melanoma. Careful patient selection in consideration of extra-hepatic involvement is crucial for the effectiveness of this treatment. Independent from the primary melanoma site, it is debatable if patients with highly elevated serum-LDH may benefit from this approach.","title":"Hepatic arterial Fotemustine chemotherapy in patients with liver metastases from cutaneous melanoma is as effective as in ocular melanoma.","pubmedId":"17196362"}
