The recurrence-free and metastasis-free survival rates at 2, 5, and 10 years were 93.4% and 89.1%, 83.8% and 93.4%, and 87.4% and 82.1%, respectively. No significant difference was observed in age- and sex-adjusted mortality rates between patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed before malignant melanoma and those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed after malignant melanoma.\nRetrospective study and small patient population.\nPatients with malignant melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were not shown to have worse survival rates than those with stage IA, IB, and IIA disease. Further research and prospective study are needed.","title":"Effects of chronic lymphocytic leukemia on the development and progression of malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"20100262"}
