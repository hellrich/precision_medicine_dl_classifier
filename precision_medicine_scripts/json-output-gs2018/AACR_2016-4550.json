Glioma stem cells (GSCs) in GBM are responsible for glioma propagation and resistance to conventional therapies. GSK3 is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase. Growing evidences have supported the oncogenic roles of GSK3 in diverse cancers, including in GBM; however, the functional mechanism of GSK3 in tumor initiation and propagation remains elusive. Our study showed that nuclear GSK3 is responsible for overexpression of the histone demethylase KDM1A and critically regulates histone H3K4 methylation during glioma tumorigenesis. GSK3 phosphorylates KDM1A, which induces its binding and deubiquitination by USP22, leading to KDM1A stabilization. GSK3 and USP22-dependent KDM1A stabilization is required for the demethylation of histone H3K4, thereby repression of BMP2, CDKN1A, and GATA6 transcription, and result in GSCs self-renewal and brain tumorigenesis. Moreover, introduction of a GSK3-phosphorylation-mimic mutant KDM1A rescues the effect of GSK3 depletion on the inhibition of glioma tumorigenesis. In human glioblastoma specimens, KDM1A levels are correlated with nuclear GSK3 and USP22 levels. Furthermore, a GSK3 inhibitor tideglusib in a GBM mouse model inhibits the tumor initiating ability of GSCs, sensitizes tumors to temozolomide,and prolongs mice survivals via KDM1A down-regulation. Our findings demonstrate that nuclear GSK3 and USP22-mediated KDM1A stabilization is essential for glioma tumorigenesis and highlights that targeting GSK3 as a therapeutic target for GBM.","title":"High-level nuclear GSK3 promotes glioma tumorigenesis by phosphorylating KDM1A and inducing its deubiquitination by USP22","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4550"}
