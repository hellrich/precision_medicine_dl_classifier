Based on the pathology of bone marrow aspiration, he was diagnosed to have an angiotropic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Soon after the treatment with a combination chemotherapy, he achieved complete remission of ALCL and size and function of the adrenal glands were apparently normalized. ALCL should be included in the list of differential diagnoses of non-functioning bilateral adrenal swelling with non-specific symptoms such as fever.","title":"Angiotropic large cell lymphoma which infiltrated to the adrenal glands presenting as reversible adrenal insufficiency.","pubmedId":"9510405"}
