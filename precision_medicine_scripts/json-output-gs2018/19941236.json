By thorough preoperative clinical work-up of nodular goiter (ultrasonography, fine needle aspiration cytology the frequency of completion thyroidectomies are aimed to be less than 10% of all thyroid cancer operations. To facilitate postoperative radioiodine ablation prophylactic completion operations can be postponed to 3 months postoperatively to minimize surgical morbidity, if not performed during the early postoperative period. Prophylactic central node dissection as part of the completion operation is reserved for papillary (PTC) and medullary carcinomas (MTC) but not for follicular cancer. Lateral node dissection is recommended in nodal-positive MTC and in PTC with more than 5 lymph node metastases in the central compartment.","title":"[Thyroid carcinoma found incidentally after thyroidectomy: postoperative strategy].","pubmedId":"19941236"}
