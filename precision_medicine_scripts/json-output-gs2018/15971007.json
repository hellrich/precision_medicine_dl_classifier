Three weeks after the injection of cell-grafted solution/control medium the pigs underwent catheter ablation of the atrioventricular node (AV-node). After complete AV block was created, the idioventricular beat rate was more rapid in cell-grafted pigs than that in control pigs (86+/-21 vs. 30+/-10 bpm; P\u003c0.001). Administering of isoprenalin significantly increased idioventricular rate from 86+/-21 to 117+/-18 bpm in the cell-grafted animals (P\u003c0.01). Electrophysiological mapping studies demonstrated that the idioventricular rhythm originated from the cell-injection site. Polymerase chain reaction verifying the existence of SRY DNA in the cell injection site indicated that the grafted male cells were survived. Furthermore, the connexin-43 and N-cadherin positive junctions between donor cardiomyocytes and host cells were identified.\nXenografted fetal human atrial cardiomyocytes are able to survive and integrate into the host myocardium, and show a pacing function that can be modulated by autonomic agents.","title":"Biological pacemaker created by fetal cardiomyocyte transplantation.","pubmedId":"15971007"}
