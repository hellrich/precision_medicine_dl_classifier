To target breast cancer cells that overexpress HER-2/neu mRNA, we previously described a novel strategy that combines the principle of antisense (AS) and translational inhibitory activity conferred by an iron-responsive element (IRE) (AS-IRE). Here, we showed that three potential AS-IREs, i.e. AS-IRE1, 4, and 5, derived from HER-2/neu antisense sequence could bind endogenous iron regulatory protein (IRP) and, when placed in 5\u0027 untranslated region (5\u0027UTR) of a reporter gene, the gene expression could be translationally repressed by recombinant IRP in vitro. Using AS-IRE4 as our model, we demonstrated that it is regulated by iron, and importantly, such regulation is impaired in HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we showed that AS-IRE4 could preferentially direct the expression of a reporter gene in HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Interestingly, when AS-IRE4 was placed in 5\u0027UTR of Bax gene, a pro-apoptotic protein in the Bcl-2 protein family, we observed a preferential cell killing in breast cancer cells that overexpress HER-2/neu. Taken together, our results suggest that AS-IRE behaves as a functional IRE and it may direct therapeutic gene expression to preferentially target HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells.","title":"Targeting HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells by an antisense iron responsive element-directed gene expression.","pubmedId":"11689290"}
