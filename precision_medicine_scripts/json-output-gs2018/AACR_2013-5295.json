The cause remains to be determined. Recent studies suggest that microRNAs can regulate the evolution of malignant behaviours by regulating multiple target genes. In this study, we first confirmed that miR-363 is down-regulated in HNSCC tissues with lymph node metastasis and cell lines with highly invasive capacity. We also found that podoplanin (PDPN) is up-regulated in the metastatic HNSCC tissues, and ectopic over-expression of miR-363 suppressed the metastatic behaviour of HNSCC cells by directly targeting PDPN. These data support a key role of miR-363-PDPN in head and neck cancer metastasis by regulating cellular invasion and migration.","title":"Dysregulated miR-363 affects head and neck cancer invasion and metastasis by targeting PDPN gene.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-5295"}
