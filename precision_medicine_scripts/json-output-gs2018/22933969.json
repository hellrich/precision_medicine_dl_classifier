DNA was isolated from the patients\u0027 blood and screened for mutations, polymorphisms and variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, p53, CDKN2A, MLH1 and MSH2 genes. We found no mutations but common polymorphisms, and three variants in mismatch repair genes.\nNucleotide variants c.2006-6T\u003eC and p.G322D in MSH2 might be correlated with male breast cancer.","title":"Genotyping of BRCA1, BRCA2, p53, CDKN2A, MLH1 and MSH2 genes in a male patient with secondary breast cancer.","pubmedId":"22933969"}
