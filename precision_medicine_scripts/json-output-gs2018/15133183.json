In this study we used real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to evaluate erbB-2 expression in seven canine OSA cell lines and 10 canine OSA tissue samples. We determined erbB-2 to be significantly overexpressed in 86% (six of seven) of the cell lines and 40% (4 of 10) of the OSA tissues samples. Given the importance of erbB-2 in human breast cancer, the finding of erbB-2 overexpression in canine OSA may be important in further understanding the pathogenesis and possible therapies of OSA.","title":"Overexpression of the erbB-2 proto-oncogene in canine osteosarcoma cell lines and tumors.","pubmedId":"15133183"}
