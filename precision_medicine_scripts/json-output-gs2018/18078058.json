The studies performed by a highly sensitive immunohistochemical technique. The findings have allowed the authors to state that the membranous CD117/C-Kit receptor plays an important role in the progression of uveal melanomas. It is suggested that the use of the new drug Glivec is promising in treating uveal melanoma.","title":"[Study of a role of the expression of a transmembranous CD117/C-Kit receptor in the progression of uveal melanomas].","pubmedId":"18078058"}
