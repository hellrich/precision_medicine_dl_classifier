A decrease of leukocytes and lymphocytes had been detected in the previous year. During a total clinical course of 11 months, he showed marked depletion of lymphocytes ranging from 264/microL to 459/microL. Autopsy disclosed no underlying diseases such as malignancies or tuberculosis. Extensive PML lesions were seen in the cerebral white matter. Small perivascular cuffs comprising many CD8+ T lymphocytes and a few CD4+ T cells were scattered in the PML lesions. CD20+ B cells were rarely evident. The subsets of the infiltrating lymphocytes differed from those of primary or spontaneous PML. Similar extensive PML lesions were observed not only in the cerebellum and brainstem but also in the spinal cord. All 26 segments of the spinal cord, especially the cervical, lumbar and sacral cord, showed extensive lesions involving the lateral and anterior columns. To our knowledge, only three cases of PML with such extensive spinal cord lesions have been reported previously. These three cases, and the present one, may represent a group of PML that shows extensive lesions in the spinal cord as well as the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem. The underlying disease in the present case was unclear. Because lymphocytopenia is not observed in primary or spontaneous PML, and the immunohistochemical findings of the infiltrating lymphocytes in the present case are different from primary or spontaneous PML, the decrease in his total blood lymphocytes may have played a significant role in his immunosuppressed condition as the underlying disease.","title":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy showing extensive spinal cord involvement in a patient with lymphocytopenia.","pubmedId":"19019177"}
