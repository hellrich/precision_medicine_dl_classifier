Peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) of 20 out of 25 patients (80%) with active malignant melanoma responded to an extract of malignant melanoma with LAI, whereas only 4-5% of 475 control subjects showed a response. The malignant melanoma patients reacted to both allogeneic and autologous extracts of malignant melanoma which indicates a common cross-reacting antigen. Malignant melanoma patients did not respond to unrelated tumour extracts. The LAI was mediated by PBL (monocytes) \"armed\" with cytophilic anti-tumour antibody specific for the sensitizing tumour antigen. The anti-tumour response of the malignant melanoma patients was dependent on the stage of the cancer, and 11 out of 13 Stage I patients had a positive NAI,  whereas patients with disseminated cancer had decreased response. The diminished LAI in patients with large tumour burdens appeared to be the result of release of tumour antigen systemically. Also, surgery and chemotherapy depressed LAI. Although LAI was depressed after surgical excision of the cutaneous melanoma, most patients showed LAI 1-3 months later. Tumour-free melanoma patients monitored for one year by the Tube LAI assay showed a decline in their anti-tumour immunity 5-6 months after surgery. The NAI was low or negative after the 8th post-surgical month in tumour-free patients. Patients with residual malignant melanoma showed persistent or  recurrent LAI after the 8th post-surgical month. LAI reactivity monitored after \"curative\" surgery for malignant melanoma may assist in determining whether the patient is tumour-free or has a recurrence.","title":"Anti-tumour immunity in malignant melanoma assay by tube leucocyte adherence inhibition.","pubmedId":"962991"}
