Of the 60 cases, 22 were treated with Herceptin and Taxol and 38 with Taxol and doxorubicin.\nThe total response rate (RR) of Herceptin and Taxol was 68.2%, and that of Taxol and doxorubicin was 44.7%. The RR of patients with Her-2/neu(+++) was 75%, while that of patients with Her-2/neu(++) was 50%. The major adverse effects were gastro-intestinal tract reactions, myopathy, bone marrow suppression and alopecia.\nThe treatment with Herceptin and Taxol is effective and safe for patients with Her-2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. The therapeutic effect is related to the degree of Her-2/neu overexpression.","title":"[Effect of Herceptin combined with Taxol on patients with Her-2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer].","pubmedId":"15059359"}
