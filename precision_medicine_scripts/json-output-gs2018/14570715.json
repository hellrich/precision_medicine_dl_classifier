We analyzed these \u0027low-confidence\u0027 tumors and determined that their \u0027uncertain\u0027 prediction status arises as a result of widespread perturbations in multiple genes whose expression is important for ER subtype discrimination. Patients with \u0027low-confidence\u0027 ER+ tumors exhibited a significantly worse overall survival (P\u003d0.03) and shorter time to distant metastasis (P\u003d0.004) compared with their \u0027high-confidence\u0027 ER+ counterparts, indicating that the \u0027high-\u0027 and \u0027low-confidence\u0027 binary distinction is clinically meaningful. We then discovered that elevated expression of the ERBB2 receptor is significantly correlated with a breast tumor exhibiting a \u0027low-confidence\u0027 prediction, and this association was subsequently validated across multiple independently derived breast cancer expression datasets employing a variety of different array technologies and patient populations. Although ERBB2 signaling has been proposed to inhibit the transcriptional activity of ER, a large proportion of the perturbed genes in the \u0027low-confidence\u0027/ERBB2+ samples are not known to be estrogen responsive, and a recently described bioinformatic algorithm (DEREF) was used to demonstrate the absence of potential estrogen-response elements (EREs) in their promoters. We propose that a significant portion of ERBB2\u0027s effects on ER+ breast tumors may involve ER-independent mechanisms of gene activation, which may contribute to the clinically aggressive behavior of the \u0027low-confidence\u0027 breast tumor subtype.","title":"Classifying the estrogen receptor status of breast cancers by expression profiles reveals a poor prognosis subpopulation exhibiting high expression of the ERBB2 receptor.","pubmedId":"14570715"}
