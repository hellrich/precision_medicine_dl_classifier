Three age groups were formed: \u003c 60 years, 60-74 years; \u003e or \u003d 75 years.\nThe relative percentage of colorectal cancer increases with advanced age (\u003c 60 years 7%; 60-74 years 12%, \u003e or \u003d 75 years 15%; p \u003c 0.001). In older patients with stage III carcinomas, adjuvant treatment was done less frequently in accordance with the treatment recommendations (\u003c 60 years 83-89%; 60-74 years 67-77%; \u003e or \u003d 75 years 29-36% according to stage and tumor localization); in stage IV, the use of chemotherapy was reduced (\u003c 60 years 87.5-100%; 60-74 years 38-47%; \u003e or \u003d 75 years 33-37%). In the univariate analysis, age \u003e or \u003d 75 years (4-year survival rates: \u003c 60 years 68 +/- 4.1%; 60-74 years 58 +/- 2.8%; \u003e or \u003d 75 years 38 +/- 3.7%), UICC stage and surgical treatment had a significant effect on prognosis. Adjuvant treatment had no significant effect on the whole population but on patients with UICC stage III and IV. In the multivariate analysis, however, the only independent prognostic parameters were age \u003e or \u003d 75 years (p \u003d 0.001), performance of chemotherapy (colon cancer) or radiochemotherapy (rectal cancer; p \u003d 0.004-0.001), and tumor stage (p \u003d 0.045-0.001). Sex (p \u003d 0.063) and age between 60 and 74 years (p \u003d 0.067) had a borderline influence.\nWith increasing age, there is a departure in daily practice from the treatment recommendations. The patient\u0027s prognosis is dependent upon age (especially \u003e or \u003d 75 years), tumor stage, and therapy.","title":"Incidence, therapy and prognosis of colorectal cancer in different age groups.
