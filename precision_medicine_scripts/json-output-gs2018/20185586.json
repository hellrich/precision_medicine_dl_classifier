All the tumor cells express oncogenic ALK resulting from a chromosomal translocation involved in lymphomagenesis. Although antibodies and T-cell responses to ALK have previously been detected in ALK-positive ALCL patients, their prognostic significance is unknown. We investigated a large cohort of uniformly treated ALK-positive pediatric ALCL patients to ascertain whether the titers of preexisting ALK autoantibodies correlated with clinical and histologic characteristics, tumor dissemination, and patient outcome. ALK autoantibodies were analyzed in pretherapeutic serum samples from 95 patients enrolled into 2 therapy studies between 1996 and 2007. ALK autoantibodies were detected in 87/95 patients. The titers inversely correlated with stage and amount of circulating tumor cells. High antibody titers correlated with significantly lower cumulative incidence of relapses (CI-R): titers \u003e or \u003d 1/60 750, n \u003d 29, CI-R 11% +/- 6%; titers 1/2025-\u003c 1/60 750, n \u003d 39, CI-R 31% +/- 8%; and titers 0-\u003c or \u003d 1/750, n \u003d 27, CI-R of 63% +/- 10% (P \u003c .001). Our results provide the first clinical evidence that a robust preexisting immune response to an oncoantigen resulting from an oncogenic chromosomal translocation inhibits lymphoma dissemination and decreases the risk of relapse.","title":"Correlation of the autoantibody response to the ALK oncoantigen in pediatric anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma with tumor dissemination and relapse risk.","pubmedId":"20185586"}
