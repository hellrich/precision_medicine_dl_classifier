{"genes":["serum albumin"],"publicationTypes":["2017 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium"],"abstract":"Background: Patients with gastric cancer that involves the upper part of the stomach should undergo total gastrectomy for their curative resection. Roux-en-Y reconstruction is the most common procedure followingtotal gastrectomy. However, this reconstruction causes them various postgastrectomy symptoms and problems of their nutritional status and QOL. Although the development of the new reconstruction to prevent these symptoms have being carried out, we have not generally established procedures. Methods: To compare the feasibility and the nutritional parameters of the patients with Roux-en-Y reconstruction with aboral pouch following total gastrectomy to the simple Roux-en-Y. From February 2011 to June 2014, sixty three patients with gastric cancer underwent total gastrectomy. We analyzed the short-term outcome of surgery and the nutritional parameters in two groups. Results: The aboral pouch was created as a side to side anastomosis approximately 50 cms distal to the esophagojejunostomy, 12 cm in length. Most nutritional parameters after surgery were similar in two groups. However, lymphocyte, serum albumin and prognostic nutritional index in aboral pouch group one year later were good tendency compared with simple Roux-en-Y group. Conclusions: Roux-en-Y reconstruction with aboral pouch might become one of the standard methods after total gastrectomy for gastric cancer.","title":"The usefulness of Roux-en-Y reconstruction with aboral pouch following total gastrectomy for gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_176362-195"}
