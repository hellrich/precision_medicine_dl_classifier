HER2 expression can be discordant between primary tumors and metastases.  We have examined the bone marrow (BM) of early stage breast cancer patients for HER2-expression by disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and the association with disease recurrence.  Methods:  BM was collected from clinical stage II-III breast cancer prior to treatment between 2007-2011. Gene expression of ERBB2 was determined by multiplex PCR (Fluidigm Biomark [FB]).  Positive expression was defined as at least 1.4 fold above a pool of normal BM. Expression was confirmed by single gene PCR and Nanostring nCounter (NC) assays.  Cox proportional model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR).  Results:  BM from 74 patients was analyzed.  Median follow-up was 3.4 years (range 8 months-84 months). 24% of the patients developed metastatic disease. For ERBB2 detection, there was excellent correlation between NC and the FB assays (kappa\u003d0.87, 95% CI [0.62, 1.00]).  Nine patients expressed ERBB2 in their BM. Five of the 9 patients had Her2-positive tumors and were treated with trastuzumab. One of 5 (20%) of these patients relapsed whereas 75% (3 of 4) of the patients with HER2-negative tumors but ERBB2-positive DTCs relapsed.   Patients with HER2-negative tumors/ERBB2-positive BM  were found to have a greater hazard of recurrence than patients with HER2-negative tumors/ERBB2-negative BM or ERBB2-positive DTCs treated with trastuzumab (p\u003d.0069; Table). Those patients with ERBB2-positive BM who did not receive trastuzumab had a decreased disease free survival (p\u003d.016).  Conclusions:  We have found discordant expression of  HER2/ERBB2 in tumors and BM of stage II-III breast cancer patients. The presence of ERBB2 expressing DTCs in patients with HER2-negative tumors identifies a subset of patients at increased risk of recurrence who may benefit from targeted HER2-therapy.
