Within that 1% are widely varied tumors now divided into types and subtypes. Sarcoma occur in patients of all ages with frequency spread evenly over the human age range. Although the specific cell of origin of many sarcoma remains unclear, sarcoma are all tumors of mesenchymal origin. The mesenchymal stem cell, a pluripotent cell, which gives rise to varied differentiated cells including osteocytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes, muscle cells, fibroblasts, neural cells and stromal cells, is the most likely ultimate cell of origin for sarcoma. When mesenchymal stem cell genetics go awry and malignant transformation occurs sarcoma including osteosarcoma, Ewing\u0027s sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma and many others can initiate. Our knowledge of sarcoma genetics is increasing rapidly. Two general groups, sarcoma arising from chromosomal translocations and sarcoma with very complex genetics, can be identified. Genes that are frequently mutated in sarcoma include TP53, NF1, PIK3CA, HDAC1, IDH1 and 2, KDR, KIT and MED12. Genes that are frequently amplified in sarcoma include CDK4, YEATS4, HMGA2, MDM2, JUN, DNM3, FLT4, MYCN, MAP3K5, GLI1 and the microRNAs miR-214 and miR-199a2. Genes that are upregulated in sarcoma include MUC4, CD24, FOXL1, ANGPTL2, HIF1α, MDK, cMET, TIMP-2, PRL, PCSK1, IGFR-1, TIE1, KDR, TEK, FLT1 and several microRNAs. While some alterations occur in specific subtypes of sarcoma, others cross several sarcoma types. Discovering and developing new therapeutic approaches for these relentless diseases is critical. The detailed knowledge of sarcoma genetics may allow development of sarcoma subtype-targeted therapeutics.","title":"Searching for molecular targets in sarcoma.","pubmedId":"22387046"}
