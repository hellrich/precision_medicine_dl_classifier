A unique feature is a transparent opening in wall to simulate the location of the beam port and to provide a beam-eye view of the head. A portable stereotactic frame was built to facilitate head markings. These marking provide critical reference points for determining the entry point of the central beam axis and patient positioning coordinates calculated relative to these points.\nThis patient positioning and immobilization system has proven to be satisfactory in minimizing the variations from the planned BNCT radiation doses.\nThe approach described herein has been satisfactory in treating patients with GBM. These patients are minimally sedated during BNCT lasting from 38 to 73 minutes.","title":"Patient positioning in static beams for boron neutron capture therapy of malignant glioma.","pubmedId":"11153692"}
