Head and neck localization is very rare, showing an incidence ranging from 4 % to 10 % in different series of investigations. The most frequent involved sites in UHPS are the neck and parotid, followed by the scalp, face, anterior skull base and orbit. Upper aerodigestive tract, lateral skull base and ear are rare locations. The incidence of the lymphatic metastases is also rare. The aim of this article is to report a case of UHPS in the maxillary sinus with palatal, orbital and ethmoidal involvement, with lymphatic metastasis and its surgical treatment. In addition, we review the literature of similar cases of the past 12 years.","title":"Malignant fibrous histiocytoma/undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma of the maxillary sinus: report of a case and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"23812657"}
