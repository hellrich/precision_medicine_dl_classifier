This is the first study of FLT3 mutations in pediatric non-promyelocytic AML patients that received the same treatment scheme in single institute. FLT3 internal tandem duplication of the juxtamembrane domain (FLT3/ITD) and a point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3/TKD) were analyzed in 61 patients by PCR of genomic DNA. The incidence of FLT/ITD and FLT/TKD were 6.6% (4/61) and 3.3% (2/61), respectively. Patients with FLT3/TKD remain alive after autologous stem cell transplantation. The disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with FLT3/ITD (0%) was significantly lower than that of the others (52%). FLT3/ITD was the sole adverse prognostic factor for DFS by multivariate analysis (RR\u003d5.6). Patients with FLT3/ITD relapsed early after complete remission even after receiving bone marrow transplantation from a matched related donor with little BuCy conditioning. New therapeutic scheme such as stem cell transplantation with more intensive conditioning just after complete remission could be applied in pediatric non-promyelocytic AML patients with the FLT3/ITD mutation.","title":"Prognostic significance of FLT3 mutations in pediatric non-promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"15863200"}
