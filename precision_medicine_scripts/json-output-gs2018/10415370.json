These findings are consistent with models of basal ganglia organization which predict that blockade of dopamine receptors should result in a disinhibition of cells in these structures. In the GPi, labeling was most pronounced along the ventral, lateral and medial borders of the nucleus and none of the pallidal cells expressing FLI were immunopositive for choline acetyltransferase. In the SN, immunoreactive nuclei were concentrated in the pars reticulata and the majority of labeled nigral neurons did not display tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity. A small number of cells displaying FLI were also observed in the external pallidal segment, but no labeling was seen in the subthalamic nucleus. These findings indicate that blockade of dopamine receptors induces a characteristic pattern of Fos expression in the primate brain which strongly resembles that previously reported in rodents.","title":"Haloperidol induces Fos expression in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra of cynomolgus monkeys.","pubmedId":"10415370"}
