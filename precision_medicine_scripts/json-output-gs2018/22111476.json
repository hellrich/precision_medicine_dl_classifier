A gastric tumor was shown on endoscopy. Histopathologic evaluation revealed Primary Gastric Choriocarcinoma (PGC). The patient was treated with three cycles of standard nongestational choriocarcinoma chemotherapy. Tumor persistence was evidenced by CT Scans and high serum beta-HCG levels. The patient died approximately six months after diagnosis. Our case report suggest that PGC is a highly aggressive tumor that is often associated with liver and lungs metastasis without evidence of pelvic organ abnormality and is associated with some hormonal effects, such as amenorrhea, anemia, nausea and vomiting mimicking pregnancy in young adult female","title":"Unusual presentation of primary gastric choriocarcinoma in a 24-year-old female patient.","pubmedId":"22111476"}
