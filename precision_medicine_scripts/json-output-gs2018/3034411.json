SCLC differs from NSCLC by the expression of biomarkers, including creatine kinase-BB isoenzyme (EC 2.7.3.2). Subtypes of SCLC are referred to as classic and variant, both of which have elevated levels of creatine kinase-BB isoenzyme. We, therefore, applied 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to cell lines of classic SCLC, variant SCLC, and NSCLC human tumors, using continuous perfusion to identify any differences in the detectable levels of intracellular high-energy phosphate compounds. The spectra indicate that only the variant SCLC cells maintain high levels of phosphocreatine. Additionally, the classic SCLC cells express elevated levels of a diphosphodiester. Neither phosphocreatine nor diphosphodiesters are found in the NSCLC cell spectra.","title":"Levels of high energy phosphates in human lung cancer cell lines by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.","pubmedId":"3034411"}
