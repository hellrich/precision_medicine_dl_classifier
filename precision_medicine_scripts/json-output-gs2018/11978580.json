The authors prospectively examined dietary factors hypothesized to be associated with exocrine pancreatic cancer in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort in Finland. Of the 27,111 male smokers aged 50-69 years with complete dietary information, as ascertained from a self-administered dietary history questionnaire given at baseline (1985-1988), 163 developed pancreatic cancer from 1985 through November 1997. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate smoking- and age-adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Energy-adjusted butter consumption and saturated fat intake were positively associated with pancreatic cancer (highest quintile vs. lowest: hazard ratio (HR) \u003d 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.87, 2.25 (p trend \u003d 0.04), and HR \u003d 1.60, 95% CI: 0.96, 2.64 (p trend \u003d 0.02), respectively). Energy intake and energy-adjusted carbohydrate intake were inversely associated with the disease (highest quintile vs. lowest: HR \u003d 0.62, 95% CI: 0.36, 1.07 (p trend \u003d 0.05), and HR \u003d 0.62, 95% CI: 0.37, 1.03 (p trend \u003d 0.02), respectively). These results support the hypothesis that a high intake of saturated fat may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer in smokers, while greater intakes of energy and carbohydrate may reduce the risk.","title":"Prospective study of diet and pancreatic cancer in male smokers.","pubmedId":"11978580"}
