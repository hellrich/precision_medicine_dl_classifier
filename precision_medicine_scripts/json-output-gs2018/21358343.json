The presence of ALK rearrangements was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.\nOf the 221 screened patients, 45 demonstrated ALK rearrangements, and these individuals were younger than the ALK-negative patients (p \u003c 0.001). The proportion of never smokers and light smokers was found not to differ according to the ALK status (p \u003d 0.537). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and ALK rearrangements were found to be mutually exclusive. Thyroid-transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) expression was observed in all ALK-positive tumors for which immunohistochemistry data were available. The objective response rate and progression-free survival to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy showed no significant differences between ALK-positive and ALK-negative patients. On the other hand, no patient with ALK-positive tumors achieved objective tumor responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). ALK rearrangements were not found among individuals who had EGFR mutations, an objective response to a previous EGFR TKI treatment or TTF-1-negative tumors.\nThe clinical outcomes of platinum-based chemotherapy were found not to differ according to the ALK status. Both smokers and never/light smokers should be candidates for ALK screening. We suggest that the exclusion of patients with activating EGFR mutations, an objective response to previous EGFR TKIs, or TTF-1-negative tumors from ALK screening could be an effective enrichment strategy for ALK-positive cases.","title":"Clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma: suggestion for an effective screening strategy for these tumors.","pubmedId":"21358343"}
