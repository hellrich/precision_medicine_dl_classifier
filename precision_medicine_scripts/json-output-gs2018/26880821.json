The patient underwent wide local excision but was unresponsive to dacarbazine. Targeted therapy with vemurafenib had shown clinical improvement for a 5-month duration until he showed signs of disease progression. Just after the shift of adjuvant therapy to ipilimumab, he was diagnosed with multiple cerebral metastases that eventually led to his demise 6â€…months after initiation of vemurafenib, having had a 12-month survival period from the time of initial melanoma diagnosis.","title":"Perianal melanoma with a BRAF gene mutation in a young Portuguese Roma native.","pubmedId":"26880821"}
