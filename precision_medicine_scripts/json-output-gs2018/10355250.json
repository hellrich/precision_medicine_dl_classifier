The incidence of p53 gene mutation in bladder tumor patients were studied and were compared with clinicopathological findings, smoking history and prognosis.\nPolymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was used for analysis from exon 4 to 9 of p53 gene in 105 cases of primary bladder tumors.\np53 matations were detected in 38 or 105 patients (36.2%). Kaplan-Meier Survival curves fo groups wit or without p53 gene mutation show a statistically significant difference (p \u003d 0.0098). The mutation of p53 gene in stages pT 1 pT 1. pT 2, pT 3, pT 4 was found in 2 of 12 (16.7%), 8 of 32 (25.0%), 10 of 25 (40.0%), 12 of 20 (60.0%), 6 of 16 (37.5%) and in grades I, II, III, was noted in 1 of 17 (5.9%), 16 of 49 (32.7%), 21 of 39 (53.8%) cases, respectively. Significant differences were found for groups with grade I and grade II-III (p \u003d 0.0045) cancers and in cases of superficial (stage pTa-1) and muscle-invasive (pT 2-4) tumors (p \u003d 0.0148). However, mutation of p53 was not related to either age or sex in 105 patients. Recurrence rates in stage pTa-1 superficial tumor group with or without p53 mutation showed a statistically significant difference (p \u003d 0.0419). No statistically significant difference was noted between p53 mutation and habitual smoking as well as durations of smoking.\np53 mutations occur more commonly in higher grades and later stages of bladder tumors. Our results suggest that the prognostic factor is linked to not only histological findings but also to the presence of p53 mutation. The mutations of the p53 gene may be involved in the late events of tumorigenesis and might be used as good molecular markers for prognosis in bladder tumor.","title":"[p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation and prognosis in 105 cases of bladder cancer--the relationship between mutation of the p53 gene with clinicopathological features and smoking].","pubmedId":"10355250"}
