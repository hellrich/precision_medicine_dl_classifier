We have demonstrated that SGN-35 (cAC10-vcMMAE) binds to CD30 on target cells and releases intracellular monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) in vitro, contributing to potent killing of CD30+ cells. Using a set of auristatin-based ADCs, we evaluated whether the intratumoral concentration of the released payload is a predictive indicator of antitumor activity in preclinical models.We first treated CD30+, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) Karpas 299 tumors with SGN-35 or a non-binding control ADC (IgG-vcMMAE). The plasma ADC and MMAE PK measurements were similar in SGN-35 and IgG-vcMMAE treated tumor-bearing animals. In contrast, SGN-35 generated 5-fold greater intratumoral MMAE exposure than IgG-vcMMAE, which correlated with tumor regression observed in the SGN-35- treated group.We then examined the relationship between released MMAE and in vitro cytotoxicity by targeting different receptors expressed on the same cells. The lymphoma cell line L82 expresses CD30, CD70, and CD71 receptors. Although auristatin-based ADCs targeting each of these targets has a different IC50, the intracellular MMAE was similar when 50% growth inhibition was achieved (approximately 200 nM). In vivo, CD30, CD70, or CD71-directed ADCs demonstrated similar antitumor activity for a given dose level (0.5, 1, or 3 mg/kg). Concordantly, equal intratumoral MMAE concentrations were observed for a given dose level, regardless of the antigen target.The cell permeable MMAE has been shown to mediate bystander killing in vitro. To evaluate whether intratumoral MMAE mediates bystander killing in vivo, an admixed tumor model consisting CD30+ and CD30- Karpas 299 cells was treated with SGN-35. As predicted, both CD30+ and CD30- tumor cells were killed, presumably due to intratumoral diffusion of MMAE across cell membranes. In contrast, a conjugate with a highly polar form of auristatin (MMAF) was unable to kill the CD30-negative cell population of the admixed tumors.These preclinical results provide evidence that the concentration of released MMAE within the tumor correlates with the ADC antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the in vivo bystander activity of MMAE may improve utility of this chemotype in tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression.","title":"Relationship between in vivo antitumor activity of ADC and payload release in preclinical models","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3694"}
