Clinical history and findings from workup, including imaging studies, skin examination, and sentinel lymph node biopsy, were negative for evidence of melanoma elsewhere. The mean Breslow depth was 9.6 mm. Two patients developed satellite or in-transit recurrences, 1 developed pulmonary metastasis, and another died of liver metastases. Overall, the cohort showed a 92% melanoma-specific survival rate at a mean duration of follow-up of 44 months. The IHC findings showed that PDM exhibited lower levels of staining for the antigens p53 (P \u003d .02), Ki-67 (Mib-1) (P \u003d .002), cyclin D1 (P \u003d .001), and podoplanin (recognized by D2-40 antibody) lymphovascular staining (P \u003c.001) compared with MM and PNM. All other markers were comparable.\nPatients with PDM have remarkably prolonged survival compared with patients with MM or PNM of similar thickness. Preliminary results suggest that PDM may be characterized by lower levels of p53, Ki-67, cyclin D1, and D2-40 compared with histologically similar MM and PNM.","title":"Primary dermal melanoma: distinct immunohistochemical findings and clinical outcome compared with nodular and metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"18209168"}
