The complex formed between activated protein C (APC) and the serpin, protein C inhibitor (PCI), is a sensitive indicator of the activation of blood coagulation. The purpose of the study was to establish whether the APC-PCI complex can provide information useful for the assessment of outcome after aortic surgery.\nIn 38 patients, the APC-PCI complex was initially determined every 6 h and daily from day three. Protein C, antithrombin, global haemostatic tests, and clinical scores were investigated. Length of stay at the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital, and vital status up to two years were recorded.\nThe median APC-PCI complex concentration in samples drawn 0-6 h after surgery was more than 20-fold higher than the upper limit of the reference interval. The level then declined rapidly, but remained elevated during the first two days. In patients with higher initial APC-PCI complex concentrations, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were higher, the ICU stay was longer, and survival up to two years was lower. Patients who did not survive the ICU care had higher APC-PCI complex levels at 6-12 h and 12-18 h.\nHigh concentrations of the APC-PCI complex within 6-18 h after the aortic surgery predict a sinister outcome. The results suggest that the APC-PCI complex is indicative of the severity of the disease.","title":"The APC-PCI complex concentration predicts outcome of aortic surgery.","pubmedId":"17141298"}
