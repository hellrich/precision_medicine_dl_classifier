By their endoscopic presentation, they are similar to primary bronchogenic carcinoma. Eleven patients with endobronchial metastases were presented, 8 male and 3 female. The average age was 58.27 years (from 37 to 72 years). Primary renal carcinoma existed in 2 patients. The one was operated 5 years before the metastases appeared in bronchus, and the metastases in bronchial wall contributed to the discovery of primary tumor in the other patient. Endobronchial metastases appeared in 3 patients, 2 years after the surgery of malignant colonic or rectal tumor, and in fourth patient it appeared 5 years after the surgery. One female patient sustained mastectomy and the radiation therapy was performed 11 years before the bronchial metastases occurred and the other female patient had the disease revealed a year ago and the polytherapy was performed. In the female patient with non Hodgkin Lymphoma, the change in bronchus was revealed simultaneously as the primary disease. Endobronchial metastases appeared in 2 patients two years after the surgery of malignant melanoma. The disease diagnosis was set by clinical-radiological examination, by endoscopy and by the comparison of histopathologic finding of primary carcinoma and metastases.","title":"[Endobronchial metastases in extrapulmonary malignant tumors].","pubmedId":"9265373"}
