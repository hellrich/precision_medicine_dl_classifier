Three (23%) were found positive for the presence of the BRAF mutation and were treated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. Dabrafenib was well tolerated with no grade 3 or higher toxicity. The median number of cycles was 7 (a cycle was defined as 1 month of daily dabrafenib) and best response was stable disease in two patients and a partial response in one patient. Median progression-free survival was 7 months with a range of 4-10 months. ","title":"Recurrent ganglioglioma in adults treated with BRAF inhibitors.","pubmedId":"26680369"}
