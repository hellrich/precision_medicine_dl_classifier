The lesions common to both entities include, to varying degrees, steatosis, liver cell ballooning, lobular inflammation with a notable component of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and a characteristic form of fibrosis that is initially located in the perisinusoidal regions of acinar zone 3. Cirrhosis with or without steatosis or steatohepatitis may occur in both entities. Mallory\u0027s hyaline is common but not necessary; megamitochondria and varying amounts of iron may be observed in either process. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a recognized complication of both processes, albeit with greater frequency in the former. Alcoholic hepatitis may present with more severe clinical and histologic manifestations than the nonalcoholic counterpart, including significant morbidity and mortality. The perivenular lesions collectively referred to as sclerosing hyaline necrosis are markers of severity, and are not common in nonalcoholics. In many instances, however, the microscopic lesions of these two processes are similar, likely as a reflection of common pathogenetic pathways, and the distinction between the two is ultimately clinically derived.","title":"Alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.","pubmedId":"12122863"}
