{"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours are reported to occur in a variety of sites, including the head and neck, abdominal organs, central nervous system and urinary tract. They only rarely occur in the lung. We report a case of a 25-year-old male admitted with haemoptysis. His chest radiograph showed a peripheral right lung opacity and computed tomography revealed a right lower lobe soft tissue density mass. Bronchoscopy and fine needle aspiration were unhelpful. a diagnosis of pulmonary carcinoma was made, and the patient underwent a right lower lobectomy. On pathology, the tumor was found to be an inflammatory pseudotumor. These lesion are extremely rare, constituting less than 1% of pulmonary malignancies, but are known to occur in young patients. We believe clinicians need to retain an index of suspicion for the presence of this disease in young patients, which can masquerade as more common malignancies.","title":"An unusual cause of haemoptysis in a young male.","pubmedId":"16522195"}
