Lung cancer incidence suggests that gender-related factors may influence lung cancer risk. The carcinogenic effect of tobacco smoke and the use of hormone replacement therapy could result in susceptibility to lung cancer among women. Mutations in EGFR and HER-2/neu genes, and ROS1 gene fusions may also play a role in gender-based survival rate differences. This review summarizes the latest data of disease markers and its usefulness in female lung cancer.
