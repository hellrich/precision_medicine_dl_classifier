There is currently no treatment for refractory, metastatic PTC, which results in 1500 deaths in the US each year. A challenge in identifying targeted therapies for Ret fusion driven cancers has been the lack of predictive models. We created transgenic, over-expression Drosophila models of PTC1 and PTC3, and found that they cause cancer phenotypes such as delamination, cell migration, and EMT. We conducted a genetic screen of the Drosophila kinome (252 alleles) and a drug screen of FDA approved cancer therapeutics (62 compounds) against flies expressing either PTC1 or PTC3. We found that PTC1 and PTC3, despite containing identical Ret kinase domains, have a different signaling output and are sensitive to different kinase inhibitors. Of the 19 kinases that were identified as hits from the PTC3 kinome screen, only 5 overlap with PTC1 hits. PTC3 is most sensitive to Ponatinib, where as PTC1 is most sensitive to Cabozantinib. These findings suggest that patients may greatly benefit from targeted treatment directed against the specific Ret fusion that they harbor.","title":"Drosophila models of Ret fusions in papillary thyroid carcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-5150"}
