The median age at diagnosis was 68 years; 78% of patients were white, 81% were male, 81% had stage I disease, and 67% had squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer-specific treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy, was administered to only 27 patients. The median survival time was 22 months for the treated group and 11 months for the untreated group.\nThe majority of patients with unresected early-stage NSCLC do not receive cancer therapy. They should be thoroughly considered for treatment, however, especially in light of recent advances in surgery and radiation therapy, and the development of more active, less toxic chemotherapeutic agents.","title":"Characteristics and outcomes of patients with unresected early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"12425499"}
