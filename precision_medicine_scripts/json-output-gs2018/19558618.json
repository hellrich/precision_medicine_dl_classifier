It is associated with neoplastic disorders mainly derived from the neural seath. However, the co-existence of NF1 with the full spectrum of MEN 2A has rarely been reported. The aim of the study was to investigate the presence of secondary neoplasias in a patient with diagnosed NF1, and in particular the presence of hyperparathyroidism and the possible co-existence with another pheochromocytoma-related syndrome.\nWe report a case of a 70 years old female patient who had NF1. The patient was referred to our center and was diagnosed with an isolated pheochromocytoma of the right adrenal gland for which she underwent right adrenalectomy. We further investigated for the presence of another pheochromocytoma-related syndrome and in particular for the presence of hyperparathyroidism and medullary thyroid cancer. Molecular screening for germline mutations of the genes NF1, RET and VHL has also been performed.\nThe patient was further diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism and medullary thyroid cancer, having the full spectrum of the clinical picture of the MEN2A syndrome. The genetic testing revealed the germline mutation for NF1 but not for the RET proto-oncogene which is generally found in MEN2A cases.\nTo our knowledge this is a rare case of co-existence of two pheochromocytoma-related genetic syndromes, and generates the question of whether all patients with these syndromes should undergo a thorough clinical and laboratory investigation for the possibility of another co-existing pheochromocytoma-related genetic syndrome.","title":"Neurofibromatosis type 1: should we screen for other genetic syndromes?
