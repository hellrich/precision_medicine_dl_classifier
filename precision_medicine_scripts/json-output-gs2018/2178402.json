The literature is reviewed for previous case reports of this rare lesion in males. Benign cystic mesotheliomas occur predominantly in females. Despite a marked tendency to recur, no malignant degeneration has ever been demonstrated, and only one mortality has ever been attributed directly to this lesion. The diagnosis of this entity is made by confirming the benign mesothelial nature of the cells lining the cysts with electron microscopy or immunohistochemical staining. No significant difference in the clinicopathologic presentation of cystic mesotheliomas in men and women is found.","title":"Benign cystic mesothelioma in a male.","pubmedId":"2178402"}
