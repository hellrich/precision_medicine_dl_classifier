NGS was performed in a CLIA setting (Foundation Medicine). Methods: DNA was extracted from needle biopsies of 33 pre-therapy primary and 17 MBCs (mean age 52 yrs; 58% ER+, 20% HER2+, 30% triple negative) obtained prospectively for biomarker discovery and preserved in RNAlater. Patients with MBC received an average of 7 drugs (range 5-17) including adjuvant therapy before biopsy for this research; 13 biopsies were from soft tissues, 3 from liver and 1 from bone. Sequencing was targeted to 3230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns in 14 genes often rearranged in cancer. Average median depth was \u003e1200x. Results: All biopsies yielded sufficient DNA. NGS revealed a total of 117 known driver mutations across 36 genes (per-tumor average\u003d2.5, range 1-6), including 37 base substitutions (32%), 28 indels (24%), 42 amplifications (36%) and 10 homozygous deletions (9%). NGS identified HER2 gene amplification in 6/7 cases scored HER2+ by FISH. The average number of functionally important alterations was surprisingly similar, 2.3 in primaries vs 2.8 in heavily treated MBCs (p\u003d0.32). Remarkably, 25/33 (76%) of primary and 14/17 (82%) of MBCs had at least 1 genomic alteration targetable with an FDA approved drug or novel agent in clinical trials. These included: ERBB2 alterations (n\u003d9), PIK3CA mutations (n\u003d8), NF1 mutations (n\u003d4, candidate for PI3K/MEK inhibitors), AKT1-3 mutations (n\u003d5, PI3K inhibitors), BRCA1/2, (n\u003d6, PARP inhibitors), and CCND2 (n\u003d3)/CDKN2A (n\u003d3) mutations (CDK inhibitors). Numerous other alterations with less apparent therapeutic implications were also observed. Conclusions: Comprehensive NGS profiling in breast cancer needle biopsies showed high frequency of genomic alterations linked to a clinical treatment option or clinical trials of targeted therapies. These results demonstrate it is feasible to use NGS to guide targeted therapy. Prospective testing of the diagnostic/predictive value of this patient selection approach is currently under way.","title":"Use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect high frequency of targetable alterations in primary and metastatic breast cancer (MBC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_100620-114"}
