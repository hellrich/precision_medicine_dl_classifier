Four of these have been follicular carcinoma, one papillary carcinoma, and one described as a thyroid adenoma. All of these had known thyroid neoplasms prior to development of their renal metastases. We report herein a seventh case of thyroid carcinoma metastatic to the kidney, unique in that the diagnosis of the kidney metastasis preceded the knowledge of the primary thyroid neoplasm. Furthermore, the follicular variant of papillary cancer, present in this case, has not been previously described in renal metastases from thyroid cancer. Treatment of the kidney metastases led to the subsequent discovery and treatment of the primary thyroid cancer. The patient underwent nephrectomy followed by total thyroidectomy, and is alive and disease-free 3 years postoperatively. Thyroid cancer metastatic to the kidney is rare clinically, but can be amenable to treatment with good long term results.","title":"Metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma presenting as a primary renal neoplasm.","pubmedId":"7618817"}
