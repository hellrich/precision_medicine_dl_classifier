Initial interventions in most children are chemotherapy in younger and radiation therapy (RT) in older children. A better understanding of the inherent risk factors along with the effects of interventions on long-term outcome can lead to reassessment of the current approaches to minimize long-term morbidity.\nTo reassess the current treatment strategies of centrally located LGG, we compared the long-term survival and morbidity of different treatment regimens. Medical records of patients primarily treated at Texas Children\u0027s Cancer and Hematology Centers between 1987 and 2008 were reviewed.\nForty-seven patients with a median follow-up of 79 months were included in the analysis. The 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients were 96% and 53%, respectively. The 5-year PFS for those treated initially with RT (12 patients; median age, 11 years [range, 3-15 years]) and with chemotherapy (28 patients; median age, 2 years [range 0-8 years]) were 76% and 37%, respectively (log-rank test P \u003d .02). Among children who progressed after chemotherapy, the 5-year PFS after salvage RT was 55%. Patients diagnosed at a younger age (\u003c5 years) were more likely to experience endocrine abnormalities (Fisher exact test; P\u003c.00001).\nEffective and durable tumor control was obtained with RT as initial treatment. In younger patients, chemotherapy can delay the use of RT; however, frequent progression and long-term morbidity are common. More effective and less toxic therapies are required in these patients, the majority of whom are long-term survivors.","title":"Long-term outcome of centrally located low-grade glioma in children.","pubmedId":"23625612"}
