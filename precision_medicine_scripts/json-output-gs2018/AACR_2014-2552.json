PD-1 blockade mediated by monoclonal antibodies has yielded promising therapeutic effects in treatment of melanoma, lung cancer and kidney cancers. Although detecting PD-1 expression by T cells is relatively straightforward, a simple and reliable method for determining whether PD-1 on T cells has engaged its ligand B7-H1 (PD-L1) is wanting. Our previous studies have revealed that engagement of PD-1 or B7-1 by B7-H1 results in alternations of apoptosis signaling pathway by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules among activated T cells and are correlated with B7-H1-mediated T cell death. Those observations suggest that intracellular levels of apoptosis-related Bcl2 family molecules among PD-1 positive CD8 T cells may be barometers of the extent to which PD-1 has been triggered by B7-H1. Using PD-1 and B7-H1 deficient animal models, we found that lower levels of intracellular pro-apoptosis molecules identify those activated T cells whose PD-1 molecules have not yet been extensively engaged, thus T cell function might be restored to their normal function once PD-1 signals from B7-H1 are blocked. Similarly, human PD-1 positive CD8 T cells engaged by B7-H1 also expressed higher levels of pro-apoptosis molecules during antigen stimulation. Our clinical data demonstrated that pro-apoptosis molecule expression by tumor-reactive T cell levels are higher among advanced melanoma and prostate cancers than healthy controls, reflecting chronic engagement with B7-H1. Thus, using pro-apoptosis status as signaling biomarkers for T cell PD-1 engagement, it may be possible to select patients who are most likely to have strong benefit from PD-1 or B7-H1 (PD-L1) blockade therapy.","title":"T cell apoptosis signaling biomarker of PD-1 engagement in cancer patients","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2552"}
