Preliminary reports indicate that triplet combination regimens might improve outcome in the RAS/RAF-mutated subgroup.\nThis retrospective analysis included 25 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, who received treatment with OCX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, capecitabine). The regimen consisted of oxaliplatin 70 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, irinotecan 100 mg/m2 on days 8 and 22, and capecitabine 1,400 mg/m2 on days 1-29 every 5 weeks. KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations were determined by Sanger sequencing.\n23 patients received at least 1 cycle and were evaluable for efficacy. In 10 patients, a KRAS or BRAF mutation was detected. Partial remission rate was 61%, median progression-free survival 9.8 months, and median overall survival 32.9 months for all evaluable patients. No difference in efficacy was detected between the RAS/RAF wild-type and the mutant group. OCX was well tolerated with no grade 3/4 haematological events. Diarrhoea was the major non-haematological toxicity (24% grade 3).\nIn this retrospective analysis, triplet chemotherapy with OCX was well tolerated and achieved encouraging efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer irrespective of RAS/RAF mutation status.","title":"Efficacy of triplet combination chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, irinotecan and capecitabine (OCX) in metastatic colorectal cancer in relation to RAS/RAF mutation status: results of a retrospective analysis.","pubmedId":"25427581"}
