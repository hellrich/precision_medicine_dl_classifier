Sixteen cases developed systemic metastasis during the follow-up (median: 5 years after diagnosis). The patients who did not develop metastasis (n \u003d 19) had a mean follow-up of 10.6 (9-13) years. Radiation was performed in 6 patients.\nc-Kit and SCF were expressed in all patients who did or did not develop metastasis in the further clinical course. A mean SCF expression of 77.2% (range 52.7%-97.5%) of tumors that did not develop systemic metastasis and 30.1% (range 2.9%-61.5%) of tumors with systemic metastasis were evident. Uveal melanomas revealing an increased SCF expression were found to develop no metastasis more frequently (p\u003c0.0001; hazard ratio (HR) \u003d 0.963, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.945-0.981). A mean c-Kit expression of 58.01% (range 5.9%-97.9%) in the group who did not develop metastasis and 48.9% (range 5.0%-95.9%) in the group with systemic metastasis were observed. c-Kit expression was not associated with increased rates of metastasis formation (p \u003d 0.7329; HR \u003d 0.997, 95% CI 0.982-1.013). The correlation between SCF and c-Kit is weak (0.39; 95% CI 0.06-0.63).\nc-Kit expression was not found to be associated with metastasis formation. A high SCF expression of primary choroidal melanomas was significantly associated with a lower incidence of systemic metastasis, which indicated SCF as a benign prognostic factor in the further clinical course.","title":"Expression of c-Kit and its ligand SCF in primary uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"21279973"}
