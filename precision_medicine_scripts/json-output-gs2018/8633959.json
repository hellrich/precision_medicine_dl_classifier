We reviewed our experience with this procedure to determine the operative morbidity, mortality, and long-term outcome.\nFrom January 1965 through January 1995, 22 patients (13 male, 9 female) underwent circumferential mainstem bronchial sleeve resection without removal of pulmonary parenchyma. Median age was 37 years (range, 12 to 70 years). The right mainstem bronchus was involved in 12 patients and the left, in 10. Nineteen patients (86%) were symptomatic; symptoms included cough in 5, dyspnea in 5, wheeze in 3, hemoptysis in 3, and a combination of these in 3. Conventional tomography was done in 8 patients and identified every lesion. Bronchoscopy was diagnostic in all patients. Resection was for cancer in 15 patients (68%), benign stricture in 5 (23%), and an impacted broncholith in 2 (9%). The cancer was a carcinoid in 9 patients, a mucoepidermoid carcinoma in 3, squamous cell carcinoma in 2, and adenoid cystic carcinoma in 1. Fourteen patients were postsurgically classified as stage IIIA (T3 NO MO) and 1 patient as stage IIIB (T4 N2 M0). The median length of the resected bronchus was 2.0 cm (range, 1.0 to 4.0 cm). Two patients required hilar release maneuvers. The bronchial anastomosis was reinforced with pleura in 10 patients, pericardium in 2, and serratus anterior muscle in 1.\nThere were no operative deaths. Three patients (14%) had postoperative complications. Follow-up was complete and ranged from 6 months to 25.7 years (median follow-up, 10.2 years). Twenty-one patients are currently alive. All patients are asymptomatic except 1 patient, who required a stent for an anastomotic stricture. No patient has had recurrence of cancer.\nIn properly selected patients, mainstem bronchial sleeve resection with lung preservation can be performed safely and provides excellent relief of symptoms with good long-term survival.","title":"Mainstem bronchial sleeve resection with pulmonary preservation.","pubmedId":"8633959"}
