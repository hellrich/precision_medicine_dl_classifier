However, TAMs regulation of tumor responses to chemotherapy is complicated. In different type of treatment or tumor model, TAMs can either enhance or antagonize antitumor effect of chemotherapy. Methods: We isolated TAMs from breast cancer tissues, or PBMC stimulated with culture medium of mesenchymal breast cancer cells and cocultured with breast cancer cells MCF-7 for 6-10days. After cocultured with TAMs, we treated MCF-7 with docetaxel. In vivo, we use MCF-7 with or without TAMs to generate xenografts in NOD/SCID mice and treated with docetaxel. To testify if the antagonize was dependent on specific treatment, we also treated breast cancer cells with ciaplatin. Results: With coculture of TAMs, we obversed ruduced apoptosis of docetaxel treated breast cancer cells. In mice model, TAMs co-injection xenografts antagonized the antitumor effect of docetaxel.Consisted with previous results, TAMs coculture antagonize the antitumor effect of cisplatin, suggesting the antagonize of TAMs was independent on cell cycle. Conclusions: Collectively, our study indicated the antagonize of TAMs towards chemotherapy.","title":"Tumor associated macrophages antagonize antitumor effect of chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_178545-194"}
