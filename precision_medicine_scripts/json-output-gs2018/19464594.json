Despite great efforts by many groups worldwide, other high-risk melanoma loci besides CDKN2A still remain elusive. A panel of polymorphisms that appears to confer low-to-moderate risk for melanoma has been assembled through functional and genome-wide association studies. The goal of personalized melanoma risk prediction is within our reach, although true clinical use has yet to be established.","title":"Melanoma genetics: an update on risk-associated genes.","pubmedId":"19464594"}
