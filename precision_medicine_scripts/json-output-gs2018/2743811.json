This cutaneous involvement occurred in association with systemic relapse. Histologic examination of a biopsy specimen of a cutaneous lesion showed a diffuse infiltrate of leukemic cells in the dermis. However, blood vessels and skin adnexa were well-preserved, despite the destructive nature of monocytic leukemia.","title":"Leukemia cutis in acute monocytic leukemia.","pubmedId":"2743811"}
