Germline mutations in the p16 (CDKN2A) gene have been reported in at least a quarter of such families. An association has been reported between p16 mutations and pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of developing pancreatic and other cancers in Dutch FAMMM families with a 19 bp deletion in exon 2 of the p16 gene (p16-Leiden). Mutation analysis was performed in 27 families suspected of FAMMM. Clinical and pathological data were collected from all relatives affected with cancer. A p16-Leiden mutation was identified in 19 families. These families included 86 patients with melanoma. The second most frequent cancer was pancreatic cancer, which was observed in 15 patients from 7 families. The mean age at diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was 58 years (range 38-77 years). The estimated cumulative risk of developing pancreatic cancer in putative mutation carriers by age 75 years was 17%. In 8 p16-Leiden-negative families, no cases of pancreatic cancer occurred. p16 mutation carriers have a considerable risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Further studies should evaluate the value of surveillance of the pancreas in these high-risk families.","title":"Risk of developing pancreatic cancer in families with familial atypical multiple mole melanoma associated with a specific 19 deletion of p16 (p16-Leiden).","pubmedId":"10956390"}
