We tested the hypothesis that the CXCL12 and CXCR4 expression influences the prognosis of patients with inoperable head and neck cancer treated with definite radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pretreatment tumor tissue from 233 patients with known HPV/p16(INK4A) status was analyzed. CXCL12 and CXCR4 expressions were correlated with pretreatment parameters and survival data by univariate and multivariate Cox regression.\nCXCL12 was expressed in 43.3 % and CXCR4 in 66.1 % of the samples and both were correlated with HPV/p16(INK4A) positivity. A high CXCL12 expression was associated with increased overall survival (p \u003d 0.036), while a high CXCR4 expression was associated with decreased metastasis-free survival (p \u003d 0.034).\nA high CXCR4 expression could be regarded as a negative prognostic factor in head and neck cancer because it may foster metastatic spread. This may recommend CXCR4 as therapeutic target for combating head and neck cancer metastasis.","title":"Prognostic value of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in inoperable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26374452"}
