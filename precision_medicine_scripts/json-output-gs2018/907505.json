The morphological picture of this process similar to that in spontaneous regressions of nevuses (halo-nevus), pigmentous spots (Dubreille melanosis) and superficially spreading melanoma is described. Six observations of spontaneously regressing melanomas are presented. Resorption of pigmented malignant tumors is similar to radiation resorption of malignant melanomas. It is noted that spontaneous resorption of malignant melanomas does not improve their prognosis.","title":"[Spontaneous regression of malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"907505"}
