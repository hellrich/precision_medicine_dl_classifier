For successfully interfered cell lines, the changes in cell proliferation, cell cycle, and the expression of related proteins in mitogen-activated protein signal-regulated kinase /extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ ERK) signal pathway were detected.\nAfter 2 pairs of siRNA transfection, the expressions of BRAF mRNA and protein of SW579 cell lines were significantly inhibited (P\u003c0.01). The proliferation was inhibited, the cell cycle was changed, G1/S phase increased, and MEK/ERK signal pathway was inhibited.\nInhibition of growth and proliferation of SW579 cell lines by BRAF may be functioned by de-activating MEK/ERK signal pathway.","title":"[Influence of BRAF interference on SW579 cell lines in thyroid cancer].","pubmedId":"23828701"}
