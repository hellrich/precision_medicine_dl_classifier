Here, we demonstrate in 893 newly diagnosed cases of AML mutations in the IDH1 (6%) and IDH2 (11%) genes. Moreover, we identified IDH mutations in 2 JAK2 V617F myeloproliferative neoplasias (n \u003d 96), a single case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n \u003d 96), and none in chronic myeloid leukemias (n \u003d 81). In AML, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are more common among AML with normal karyotype and NPM1(mutant) genotypes. IDH1 mutation status is an unfavorable prognostic factor as regards survival in a composite genotypic subset lacking FLT3(ITD) and NPM1(mutant). Thus, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are common genetic aberrations in AML, and IDH1 mutations may carry prognostic value in distinct subtypes of AML.","title":"Acquired mutations in the genes encoding IDH1 and IDH2 both are recurrent aberrations in acute myeloid leukemia: prevalence and prognostic value.","pubmedId":"20538800"}
