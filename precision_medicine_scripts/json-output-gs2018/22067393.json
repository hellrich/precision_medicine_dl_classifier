We used a receiver operating characteristic curve to identify the cutoffs in transcript levels at 3, 6, and 12 months that would best predict patient outcome. We validated our findings in an independent cohort of 95 patients treated elsewhere.\nPatients with transcript levels of more than 9.84% (n \u003d 68) at 3 months had significantly lower 8-year probabilities of OS (56.9% v 93.3%; P \u003c .001), progression-free survival, cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response, and complete molecular response than those with higher transcript levels. Similarly, transcript levels of more than 1.67% (n \u003d 87) at 6 months and more than 0.53% (n \u003d 93) at 12 months identified high-risk patients. However, transcript levels at 3 months were the most strongly predictive for the various outcomes. When we compared OS for the groups defined molecularly at 6 and 12 months with the usual cytogenetic milestones, categorization by transcript numbers was the only independent predictor for OS (relative risk, 0.207; P \u003c .001 and relative risk, 0.158; P \u003c .001, respectively).\nA single measurement of BCR-ABL1 transcripts performed at 3 months is the best way to identify patients destined to fare poorly, thereby allowing early clinical intervention.","title":"Assessment of BCR-ABL1 transcript levels at 3 months is the only requirement for predicting outcome for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","pubmedId":"22067393"}
