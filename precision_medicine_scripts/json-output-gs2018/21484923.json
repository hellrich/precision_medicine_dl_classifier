The role of this signaling pathway in SCC formation has not yet been elucidated.\nSixty-four tissue and blood samples were collected from 60 patients with SCC, all tobacco and alcohol users. An additional six buccal mucosa tissue samples were collected from nonsmokers and nondrinkers as control tissue.\nHedgehog-Gli pathway components were associated with clinical and pathologic features. Broders\u0027 grade and N stage were associated with higher Ptch1 and lower Gli1 expression. Tumor stage was negatively associated with Smo expression, and tumor size was positively associated with p16 expression. Ptch1 and Shh were frequently detected in the surrounding stroma. Ptch1 was found to be correlated with p16 expression, as well as with survivin expression.\nThe signaling pathway is activated in SCC and inducible in vitro by Shh protein.","title":"Hh-Gli signaling pathway activity in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"21484923"}
