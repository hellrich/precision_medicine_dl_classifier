Postoperative clinical data of 64 patients with HCC were retrospectively analyzed. K-ras, PIK3CA, and BRAF gene mutations in surgically resected specimens of the 64 patients with HCC were detected by pyrosequencing. H-ras and XB130 protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for univariate and multivariate survival analyses of the clinical and pathological parameters. The mutation rates of K-ras, PIK3CA, and BRAF genes in HCC were found to be 4.69%, 1.56%, and 0%, respectively. Positive expression rate of XB130 and H-ras in HCC was 75.0% and 93.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that clinicopathological factors impacting postoperative prognosis of patients with HCC include clinical stage, tumor diameter, and postoperative transcatheter arterial embolization therapy for HCC. Meanwhile, multivariate analysis showed that clinical stage (relative risk [RR]: 6.420, P \u003d 0.013) and tumor diameter (RR: 1.498, P \u003d 0.014) were independent factors impacting postoperative survival of patients with HCC. These findings indicate that the clinical stage and tumor diameter are independent risk factors impacting postoperative survival of patients with HCC. Gene mutations of K-ras and PIK3CA and protein expression of XB130 and H-ras are not associated with the postoperative prognosis of patients with HCC.","title":"Multivariate analysis of several molecular markers and clinicopathological features in postoperative prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"22190283"}
