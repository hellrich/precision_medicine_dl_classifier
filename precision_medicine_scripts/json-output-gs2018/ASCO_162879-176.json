BP1001is a liposome-incorporated antisense which inhibits Grb2 expression. The study aimed to define safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and anti-leukemic activity of BP1001 in patients (pts) with hematologic malignancies. Methods: This is a standard 3+3 phase I dose-finding study in pts with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase (CML-BP), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). BP1001 was given twice weekly, IV over 2-3 hours for 28 days. Dose escalation proceeded through 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 90 mg/m2. Upon completion of single agent phase I cohorts 1-6, the combination of cytarabine 20 mg SubQ BID x 10 days + 60 mg/m2 BP1001 (cohort 7) or 90 mg/m2 BP1001 (cohort 8) was studied. Results: A total of 38 pts were treated: AML (n \u003d 29), CML-BP (n \u003d 5) and MDS (n \u003d 4). Cytogenetic / molecular abnormalities included: t(9;22) (n \u003d 2), diploid (n \u003d 11), complex (n \u003d 7), BCR-ABL (n \u003d 5; including T315I in 2), FLT3D835 (n \u003d 1), FLT3ITD (n \u003d 1), CEBPA (n \u003d 1), NPM1 (n \u003d 2), TP53 (n \u003d 3), IDH1 (n \u003d 1), IDH2 (n \u003d 3), NRAS (n \u003d 1), JAK2 (n \u003d 2), GATA2 (n \u003d 1), TET2 (n \u003d 1), DNMT3A (n \u003d 1). Of 38 pts, 26 were evaluable; 12 failed completion of a full cycle due to disease progression and were replaced per protocol. Only one pt on 5 mg/m2 experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), grade 3 mucositis and hand-foot syndrome, while on high-dose hydroxyurea for proliferative CML-BP. Among 26 evaluable pts, a median of 1 cycle was administered (1-5): 6 received 2 cycles, 4 received 5 cycles, and all others received 1 cycle. Among the 21 evaluable pts on single agent cohorts, 11 experienced  50% reduction in peripheral or bone marrow blasts; 2 had improvement of leukemia cutis; 6 had transient decline in blasts (n \u003d 3) and/or stable disease (n \u003d 3). Among the 5 evaluable pts on combination therapy, 2 achieved CR and 2 achieved PR. Conclusions: BP1001 at 5-90 mg/m2 is well tolerated with no MTD identified. Results demonstrate the novel BP1001 + cytarabine combination is well tolerated with early evidence of anti-leukemic activity including CR in 2 relapsed AML pts.
