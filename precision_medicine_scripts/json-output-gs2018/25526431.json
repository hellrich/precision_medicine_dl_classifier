Inhibitors of the BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade have been proven highly effective in the metastatic disease although displaying different side effects. Here, we report a patient with BRAF V600E-mutated stage IV melanoma who developed a severe leukopenia upon targeted therapy with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Interestingly, the immediate therapeutic switch to a different BRAF inhibitor \u0027dabrafenib? had no negative influence on the leukocyte count. This case supports recent studies, which showed a differential influence of different BRAF inhibitors on patients\u0027 leukocytes despite similar clinical efficacy in melanoma.","title":"Leukocyte count restoration under dabrafenib treatment in a melanoma patient with vemurafenib-induced leukopenia: case report.","pubmedId":"25526431"}
