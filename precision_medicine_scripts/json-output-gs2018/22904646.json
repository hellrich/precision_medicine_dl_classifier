A BRAF-V600 mutation is identified in approximately half of patients with cutaneous melanoma, and is unequivocally a biomarker predictive of profound clinical benefit for these patients. However, acquired vemurafenib resistance is a major clinical challenge and therapy is not yet curative. A substantial body of translational research has been performed alongside clinical trials of vemurafenib, providing key insights into the molecular basis of response and resistance. This review summarizes the development of vemurafenib for the treatment of BRAF-V600 mutant melanoma and discusses how knowledge of critical signaling pathways will be applied for its optimal clinical use in future.","title":"Vemurafenib: a new treatment for BRAF-V600 mutated advanced melanoma.","pubmedId":"22904646"}
