It is usually associated with a bad prognosis. Histological grading is highly predictive of an aggressive behavior, with a mean survival rate of 1 year. Nonetheless, individual patient survival can vary substantially, ranging from 1 month to over 5 years. Several distinct clinical parameters and molecular alterations have recently been described in glioblastoma. The present study compares clinical, radiologic and therapeutic parameters in a series of glioblastomas to identify prognostic factors.\nWe evaluated 50 cases who were operated on for intracranial glioblastoma between January 1998-March 2004 retrospectively. All clinical records, radiological records and management modalities were evaluated as prognostic value.\nThe mean survival time was 7.5 months (range, 1-18 months). We confirmed the patients\u0027 age, gender, Karnofsky Performance Scale score at discharge, postoperative radiotherapy and reoperation as decisive prognostic factors after multivariate analyses.\nWe could show that some clinical parameters and treatment modalities were associated with prognosis. Younger age, male gender, higher Karnofsky Performance Score at discharge, total surgical resection, radiotherapy and reoperation were predictor for better prognosis.","title":"Efficacy of clinical prognostic factors on survival in patients with glioblastoma.","pubmedId":"20401838"}
