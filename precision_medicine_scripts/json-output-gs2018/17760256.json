All the 99 patients were followed up for 5 years. The histological specimens were reviewed. The expression of ER, PR, AR, c-erbB2, ki67, p53 and BRCA1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 63 carcinomas.\nThe lymph node involvement, 5-year metastasis and 5-year survival rate were 59.6% (59/99), 28.0% (26/ 93) and 72.7% (72/99), respectively. The univariate analysis showed that the survival was related to lymphatic vessel invasion, fat involvement, node-positive status, EIC, AR and c-erbB2 expression. The COX multivariate analysis identified that only node-positive status, AR negativity and c-erbB2 overexpression were independent prognostic factors.\nOur data demonstrated that the lymph node status and c-erbB2 expression are strong prognostic factors in young patients with breast cancer. AR may be an adjuvant prognostic factor. The therapeutic measurement could not benefit the outcome radically.","title":"[Clinicopathological and biological features of breast cancer in young females and their relationship with prognosis].","pubmedId":"17760256"}
