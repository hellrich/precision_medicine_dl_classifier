It has the worst prognosis of any tumor arising in the liver. Unlike hepatocellular carcinoma, no predisposing factors or high-risk populations have been demonstrated for cholangiocarcinoma other than intraphepatic choledocholithiasis such as is seen in east Asian populations. The most common clinical sign is a palpable tumor mass emphasizing that the tumor is usually detected at an advanced stage. CT scanning yields much clinical information but ultrasound-guided needle biopsy is necessary for diagnosis. Aggressive surgical resection is the only treatment modality which has afforded even slight prolongation of survival; hepatic resection must be large with uninvolved resection margins. When an IHCC is deemed resectable (localized tumor without hepatic metastases or intrahepatic or extrahepatic lymph node spread), pre-operative tumor embolization may be useful; when jaundice is present, percutaneous drainage of the dilated biliary system of the liver to be spared may also be necessary. Neither adjuvant nor neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy have shown proof of efficacity. Cholangiocarcinoma complicates sclerosing cholangitis in 10-15% of cases and is very difficult to diagnose. IHCC may also develop in Caroli\u0027s syndrome, where it is commonly found incidentally on pathologic examination of a resection specimen after surgery for a complication of the disease.","title":"[Intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"15494665"}
