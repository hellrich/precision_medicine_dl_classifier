The median age was 7.25 years. M2 and M3 were the commonest subtypes(80%). Twenty cases were hyperleukocytosis and 24 with extramedullary involvement. Thirty two percent of the patients was Auer rods positive. Two hundred and forty-four patients received combination chemotherapy. Complete remission (CR) rates varied from 55.88% to 92.31%. Intensive chemotherapy(including DA, DA + Vm26 or Vp16) was the cornerstone for high CR rate. Other factors influencing CR rate were initial WBC count and hepatosplenomegaly.","title":"[Clinical study of childhood acute myelogenous leukemia].","pubmedId":"10921093"}
