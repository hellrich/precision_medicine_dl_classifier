However, the effect and toxicity of various TKIs in differentiated TC (DTC) and medullary TC (MTC) patients have not been directly compared. The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to systematically summarize response and toxicity of TKIs in TC patients.\nAll major databases were systematically searched for publications on TKIs in TC. Primary endpoint was objective response; secondary endpoints were clinical benefit, percentage TKI dose reduction/discontinuation, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, and nausea/vomiting. Meta-analysis was performed using an exact likelihood approach and a logistic regression. Pooled percentages and 95% CIs were reported.\nIn total, 22 publications were included. For DTC patients, gefitinib induced no objective responses. Pooled percentage was highest for pazopanib, 49 (95% CI 33-64)%, and was 17 (95% CI 12-24)% for sorafenib. For MTC, gefitinib and imatinib induced no objective responses, whereas sunitinib induced objective response in 43 (95% CI 14-77)%. For vandetanib and cabozantinib, these numbers were 40 (95% CI 34-46)% and 27 (95% CI 22-32)% respectively. Clinical benefit was found in 53 (95% CI 48-59)% of DTC patients on sorafenib, and in 84 (95% CI 79-88)% and 55 (95% CI 49-61)% of MTC patients on vandetanib and cabozantinib respectively. All TKIs were associated with considerable toxicity.\nThe currently studied TKIs show a modest response, while side effects are not negligible. Therefore, we suggest to solely consider TKIs in TC patients with rapid progressive disease, for whom the benefits of treatment outweigh toxicity.","title":"Therapy of endocrine disease: response and toxicity of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with thyroid carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"25572389"}
