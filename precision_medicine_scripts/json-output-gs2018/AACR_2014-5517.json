PTC596 is efficacious in vivo across a range of xenograft tumor models, including models of glioblastoma, fibrosarcoma and leukemia as well as orthotopic models of GBM. With EC50 values of 30-200 nM in a variety of tumor cell lines, PTC596 selectively reduces the level of functional BMI1 protein resulting in the depletion of the tumor stem cell fraction. PTC596 induces the hyper-phosphorylation of BMI1 leading to its degradation and the reduction of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) activity. Mechanistic studies suggest that PTC596 inhibits APC/CCDC20 activity resulting in the persistent activation of CDK1 and CDK2 which mediate the hyperphosphorylation of BMI1. Studies are ongoing to elucidate the mechanism of PTC596 inhibition of APC/CCDC20 and its preferential depletion of the tumor stem cell fraction.","title":"PTC596-induced Bmi1 hyper-phosphorylation via Cdk1/2 activation resulting in tumor stem cell depletion","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-5517"}
