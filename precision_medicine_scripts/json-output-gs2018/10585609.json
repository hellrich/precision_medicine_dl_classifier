Metastasis is rare, and metastasis to lymph nodes has not been reported in the English literature. Case Report A patient with a history of excisions of \"cylindroma\" of the scalp over the past 20 years was initially seen with 2 recurrent scalp nodules and a firm left neck mass. Both scalp lesions and multiple neck nodes were found to be ACC at resection. The patient underwent postoperative radiation therapy and is clinically free of disease at 4 years.\nWe believe this represents the first reported case of nodal metastases from primary cutaneous ACC in the English literature.","title":"Primary cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma metastatic to cervical lymph nodes.","pubmedId":"10585609"}
