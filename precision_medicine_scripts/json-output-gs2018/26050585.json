Currently, patients with low-grade diffuse gliomas are stratified into risk subgroups by subjective histopathologic criteria with significant interobserver variability. Several key molecular signatures have emerged as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictor biomarkers for tumor classification and patient risk stratification. In this review, we discuss the effect of the most critical molecular alterations described in diffuse (IDH1/2, 1p/19q codeletion, ATRX, TERT, CIC, and FUBP1) and circumscribed (BRAF-KIAA1549, BRAF(V600E), and C11orf95-RELA fusion) gliomas. These molecular features reflect tumor heterogeneity and have specific associations with patient outcome that determine appropriate patient management. This has led to an important, fundamental shift toward developing a molecular classification of World Health Organization grade II-III diffuse glioma.
