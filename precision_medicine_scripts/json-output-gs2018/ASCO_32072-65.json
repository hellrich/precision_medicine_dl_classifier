Based upon anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) expression, the new WHO classification provisionally distinguishes between ALK+ (favorable) and ALK- (unfavorable) ALCL. The characteristics of ALCL, such as ALK expression and EBV coinfection, in individuals with HIV infection have not been adequately evaluated. The aim of this study was to investigate these features in HIV-associated ALCL cases. Methods: A MEDLINE search for all cases of HIV-associated non-cutaneous ALCL was undertaken. Data regarding patient age, gender, HIV status (CD4 count, viral load, opportunistic infections), HAART, lymphoma features (B symptoms, stage, sites of involvement, immunophenotype, ALK expression, molecular studies), EBV coinfection, therapy and outcome (survival, cause of death) were extracted and analyzed. Results: A total of 23 cases were included. Patients were of median age 39 years with a male:female ratio of 7:1. Median CD4+ count was 76 cells/mm3 and HIV viral load 416,500 copies/ml. Most (67%) patients had an opportunistic infection, although only 3 (17%) were on HAART. ALCL was extranodal in 22 cases (96%) affecting most commonly lung, soft tissue and liver. Many (78%) patients had stage IV disease and B symptoms were reported in 9 cases (50%). T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was present in all cases, CD30 was positive in 22 (96%), and the vast majority (90%) were ALK-negative. EBV was identified in 8 (35%) cases. Therapy for ALCL was documented in 15 (67%) cases; 64% received CHOP. In 2 of the 3 patients who were on HAART, long-term survival was achieved. Many (68%) patients died, with a median survival of 9 months. Death was caused by either lymphoma progression (42%) or infection (58%). Conclusions: HIV-associated non-cutaneous ALCL appears to affect younger individuals and is associated with EBV infection in a subset of cases. Apart from marked immunosuppression, the poor prognosis of HIV-associated ALCL appears to be related to the absence of ALK expression, advanced stage at presentation with prominent extranodal disease, inadequate therapy including HAART, and poor response to CHOP. Further research is needed to better understand and treat this unique HIV-associated lymphoma.","title":"HIV-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32072-65"}
