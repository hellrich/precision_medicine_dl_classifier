Several targeted therapies, such as imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib, bind to c-Kit and are approved for clinical use. However, due to their insufficient activity on cancers expressing wildtype c-Kit or insensitive forms of mutant c-Kit, the clinical response has been quite varied. Moreover, despite initial anti-cancer benefits in c-Kit mutant settings (such as in GIST), resistance to c-Kit inhibitor therapies emerges due primarily to the development of additional mutations in c-Kit.In an attempt to broaden the treatment of patients whose cancers express c-Kit (wildtype and mutant) and to enhance potency with comparable or better tolerability than the current therapeutics, we developed a c-Kit-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that disrupts tumor growth through anti-mitotic activity. Hybridomas from mice immunized with the c-Kit extracellular domain (ECD) were screened for selective c-Kit binding and degradation. A humanized lead antibody (Ab) was identified, which rapidly internalized upon binding cell-surface c-Kit, but did not block binding to the c-Kit ligand (SCF). The Ab exhibited minimal-to-no cytotoxicity against c-Kit+ cell lines in vitro. To generate cytotoxic activity and to potentially overcome resistance to current c-Kit-targeting therapies, the Ab was conjugated to the maytansinoid DM1, a powerful anti-tubulin agent, via a non-cleavable linker, SMCC (technology licensed from ImmunoGen, Inc.). The ADC demonstrated robust anti-proliferative activity against cell lines expressing mutant c-Kit (GIST) and wildtype c-Kit (SCLC, AML) in vitro. The ADC also demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity in GIST and SCLC tumor xenograft models in vivo.In summary, the anti-c-Kit ADC is highly selective and active against cancers with elevated c-Kit expression regardless of their mutational status, thus representing a promising novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of c-Kit+ solid tumors, such as GIST and SCLC, as well as hematological malignancies such as AML and aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM).","title":"Development of a novel antibody-drug conjugate for the treatment of c-Kit expressing solid tumors and AML","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-1695"}
