Particularly important are cytokines and growth factors that maintain homeostasis by regulating immunocytes, stromal and epithelial cells. Dysregulation of STAT3 by constitutive activation plays an important role in the initiation of inflammation and cellular transformation in numerous cancers, especially of epithelial origin. This review focuses on STAT3 drive in gastric cancer initiation and progression, with emphasis on its activation by cytokines, and how targeting the primary drivers or gastric STAT3 therapeutically may prevent or slow stomach cancer development.\nThis review will discuss the mechanics of STAT3 signalling, how constitutive STAT3 activation promotes gastric tumourigenesis in both human adenocarcinomas and mouse models, the nature of the upstream regulators of STAT3, and their association with chronic Helicobacter pylori infection, STAT3-activated genes that promote transformation and progression, and finally the development and use of STAT3 and upstream cytokine inhibitors as therapeutics.\nChronic STAT3 activation is a key event in gastric cancer induction and progression. Specific targeting of stomach epithelial STAT3 or blocking IL-11Rα/gp130 and/or EGFR signal transduction in chronic gastric inflammation and metaplasia may be therapeutically effective in preventing gastric carcinogenesis.","title":"Targeting STAT3 in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"22834702"}
