A trend toward multiple hypermethylation was evident in cancer tissues, with hypermethylation of two or more markers detectable in 25% of hyperplasias, 38% of adenomas, 48% of thyroid cancers, and 100% of cell lines. A rank correlation analysis of marker hypermethylation suggests that a subset of these markers is epigenetically modified in concert, which may reflect an organ-specific regulation process. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between the BRAF mutation and RAR-beta2, and a negative correlation was found between the BRAF mutation and Rassf1A.\nMethylation-induced gene silencing appears to affect multiple genes in thyroid tissue and increases with cancer progression. Additional markers with better discriminatory power between benign and malignant samples are needed for the diagnostic assessment of cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules.","title":"Quantitative assessment of promoter methylation profiles in thyroid neoplasms.","pubmedId":"15840741"}
