Positive staining refers to staining of neoplastic cells.\n73% of giant cell glioblastomas showed some degree of staining for CD34, and 55% showed strong widespread staining. 56% of non-giant cell glioblastomas showed some degree of CD34 staining, and 25% showed strong widespread staining.\nBoth giant cell and non-giant cell glioblastomas frequently show CD34 expression by neoplastic cells, which may in some cases be strong and diffuse. Strong widespread staining of neoplastic cells for CD34 was more frequent in giant cell than non-giant cell glioblastomas, however this difference was not statistically significant. CD34 staining in isolation is unlikely to be of assistance in differentiating between giant cell glioblastoma and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas with anaplastic features or anaplastic gangliogliomas.","title":"CD34 expression in glioblastoma and giant cell glioblastoma.","pubmedId":"20175958"}
