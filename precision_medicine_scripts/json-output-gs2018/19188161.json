A secondary mutation in EGFR (T790M) and amplification of the MET proto-oncogene have been identified as mechanisms of such acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We have now investigated whether addition of the oral fluoropyrimidine derivative S-1 to gefitinib might overcome gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cell lines.\nThe effects of gefitinib on EGFR signaling and on the expression both of thymidylate synthase and of the transcription factor E2F-1 in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells were examined by immunoblot analysis. The effects of S-1 (or 5-fluorouracil) and gefitinib on the growth of NSCLC cells were examined in vitro as well as in nude mice.\nGefitinib induced down-regulation of thymidylate synthase and E2F-1 in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells with MET amplification but not in those harboring the T790M mutation of EGFR. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and gefitinib synergistically inhibited the proliferation of cells with MET amplification, but not that of those with the T790M mutation of EGFR, in vitro. Similarly, the combination of S-1 and gefitinib synergistically inhibited the growth only of NSCLC xenografts with MET amplification.\nOur results suggest that the addition of S-1 to EGFR-TKIs is a promising strategy to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC with MET amplification.","title":"Addition of S-1 to the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor gefitinib overcomes gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with MET amplification.","pubmedId":"19188161"}
