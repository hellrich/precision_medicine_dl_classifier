Wang et al., Cancer Res., 55: 5173-5179, 1995). A unique 250-bp internal sequence was equally present in formalin-fixed breast carcinoma. It was not detected in normal human breasts or in other tumors. In this study, we have investigated whether this 250-bp env sequence was also present in the formalin-fixed normal tissues of individuals with env sequence-positive breast cancer. Separate paraffin-embedded sections from breast carcinoma and normal breast tissues from the same individual were obtained from the Cooperative Breast Cancer Tissue Registry of the National Cancer Institute. The 250-bp env sequence was detected in 30.1% of the 106 tumors but in only 1 of the 106 normal breast tissues. These results indicate that the sequence is absent in normal tissues and thus is not genetically transmitted. This strongly implies that it is of exogenous origin.","title":"Search for mouse mammary tumor virus-like env sequences in cancer and normal breast from the same individuals.","pubmedId":"11234880"}
