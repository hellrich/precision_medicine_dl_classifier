Protein was detected by immuno-precipitation and ERK activity by using ERK agent kit. p-ERK(1/2) and down-stream cyclin D1, p21(waf/cip1) expression were detected by Western blotting and the interfering role of mitogen protein-activated kinase (MEK) suppressor U0126 in the afore-mentioned indicators was examined. MTT demonstrated ACC-2 cell proliferation was substantially enhanced by bFGF, immuno-precipitation displayed ERK activity was up-regulated by bFGF, and immuno-imprinting also showed p-ERK(1/2), cyclin D1 expression was greatly enhanced and p21(waf/cip1) expression was inhibited by bFGF. U0126 suppressed the effect of bFGF. It is concluded that bFGF can promote the proliferation of human adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC-2 cells, and its pathways are associated with the up-regulated activity and expression of p-ERK(1/2), inhibited p21waf/cip1 expression and enhanced cyclin D1 expression.","title":"Effect of exogenous bFGF on the proliferation of human adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC-2 cells.","pubmedId":"18481005"}
