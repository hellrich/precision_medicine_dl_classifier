Oral malignant melanoma is a rare aggressive neoplasm usually seen in middle aged persons. This malignancy is more frequently seen on the hard palate and gingiva. Oral melanomas are associated with very poor prognosis because of the tendency to metastasise or invade tissues locally more readily than other malignant tumours of the oral cavity especially in the case of a geriatric patient. The surgical approach, combined with the chemotherapy, is the first choice treatment. This report highlights a case report of 71-year-old female patient diagnosed and treated surgically for an oral malignant melanoma of the pedunculated variety affecting the hard palate and gingiva with review of literature.","title":"Oral malignant melanoma--an unusual presentation.","pubmedId":"22612841"}
