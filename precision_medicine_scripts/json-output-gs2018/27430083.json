Estimated incidence rate calculation was standardized to the 2010 Israeli population. Independent risk factors for poorly differentiated CSCCHN were analyzed using logistic regression.\nCSCCHN was diagnosed in 621 patients. Mean age was 75.2 years; mean tumor horizontal diameter was 11.1 Â± 6.8 mm. The overall estimated incidence rate in males was higher than in females (106.2 vs. 54.3 per 1,000,000, P 0.001). Twenty cases (3.2%) had poorly differentiated CSCCHN. Scalp and ear anatomic locations were observed more often in males than in females (22.1% vs. 6.1% and 20.3% vs. 3.3%, respectively, P \u003c 0.001). Per 1 mm increment, tumor horizontal diameter increased the risk for poorly differentiated CSCCHN by 6.7% (95% CI 1.3-12.4%, P \u003d 0.014).\nCSCCHN clinicopathological risk factors are not distributed evenly among different age and gender groups.","title":"Head and Neck Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Clinicopathological Risk Factors according to Age and Gender: A Population-based Study.","pubmedId":"27430083"}
