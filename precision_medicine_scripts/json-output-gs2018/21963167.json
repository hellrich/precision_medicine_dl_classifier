It begins with extensive discussion of rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and congenital/infantile fibrosarcoma. It then presents a more abbreviated discussion of uncommon tumors such as alveolar soft part sarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, extraosseous Ewing\u0027s sarcoma, granulocytic sarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, liposarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and undifferentiated sarcoma.","title":"Pediatric soft tissue sarcomas.","pubmedId":"21963167"}
