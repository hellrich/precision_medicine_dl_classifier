Dose of dacarbazine was 250 mg/m2 X V every 4 weeks, vindesine 3 mg/m2 once every week, and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 4 weeks. Forty patients with advanced disseminated malignant melanoma are available for response. Complete remissions were obtained in three patients (8%) and partial remissions in 12 patients (30%). The total response rate was 38%. Median response duration was 4 months. Toxicity was unacceptable in five cases (nephrotoxicity, one patient; ototoxicity, two patients; hypotonia, one patient; gastrointestinal toxicity, one patient). The conclusion is that the combination dacarbazine-vindesine-cisplatin gives rise to a high response rate in patients with advanced disseminated malignant melanoma. Despite its considerable toxicity, the regimen should be tested on patients with a limited tumor burden.","title":"Dacarbazine-vindesine-cisplatin in disseminated malignant melanoma.
