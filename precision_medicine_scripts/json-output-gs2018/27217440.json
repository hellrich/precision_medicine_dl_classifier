We investigated combinations of MEK1/2, BRAFV600E and mTOR inhibitors in gliomas carrying specific genetic alterations of the MAPK pathway.\nWe used human glioma lines containing BRAFV600E (adult high-grade: AM-38, DBTRG, PLGG: BT40), or wild-type BRAF (pediatric high-grade: SF188, SF9427, SF8628) and isogenic systems of KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing NIH/3T3 cells and BRAFV600E-expressing murine brain cells. Signaling inhibitors included everolimus (mTOR), PLX4720 (BRAFV600E), and AZD6244 (MEK1/2). Proliferation was determined using ATP-based assays. In vivo inhibitor activities were assessed in the BT40 PLGG xenograft model.\nIn BRAFV600E cells, the three possible doublet combinations of AZD6244, everolimus, and PLX4720 exhibited significantly greater effects on cell viability. In BRAFWT cells, everolimus + AZD6244 was superior compared with respective monotherapies. Similar results were found using isogenic murine cells. In KIAA1549:BRAF cells, MEK1/2 inhibition reduced cell viability and S-phase content, effects that were modestly augmented by mTOR inhibition. In vivo experiments in the BRAFV600E pediatric xenograft model BT40 showed the greatest survival advantage in mice treated with AZD6244 + PLX4720 (P \u003c 0.01).\nIn BRAFV600E tumors, combination of AZD6244 + PLX4720 is superior to monotherapy and to other combinatorial approaches. In BRAFWT pediatric gliomas, everolimus + AZD6244 is superior to either agent alone. KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing tumors display marked sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition. Application of these results to PLGG treatment must be exercised with caution because the dearth of PLGG models necessitated only a single patient-derived PLGG (BT40) in this study.
