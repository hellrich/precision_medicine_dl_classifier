In this study, 51 Jewish I1307K APC mutation carriers were identified in a high-risk familial cancer clinic over a 4-year period, of whom 29 (56.8%) (four males and 25 females) were successfully telephone interviewed for 0.5-5 years (mean 2.4 +/- 1.4) after initial genetic testing. Of these 29 cases, one individual was diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of 45 years, five had adenomatous polyps (mean number of polyps \u003d 1.8), 11 had breast cancer (mean age at diagnosis 49.5 +/- 10.5 years), and 12 were asymptomatic, at the time of the testing. During the follow-up period, new colonic polyps were diagnosed in three mutation carriers, two with previously diagnosed colon cancer and polyps and only one of the asymptomatic mutation carriers, and two additional previously affected patients had new cancer diagnoses: gastric cancer and melanoma. From this descriptive study, it seems that the short-term risk for colonic polyps in I1307K APC mutation is low, primarily affecting patients with previously diagnosed colon tumors.","title":"The I1307K APC mutation in a high-risk clinic setting: a follow-up study.","pubmedId":"15733272"}
