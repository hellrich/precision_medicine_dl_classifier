Two minimal common deleted regions (CDR) (3p26-pter and 3p14.2-3p22) involving significant sites of LOH has identified in follicular thyroid carcinoma. There was also one CDR (3p25. 2-26.1) in papillary thyroid carcinoma.\nLOH is more frequently identified in follicular thyroid carcinoma than in papillary thyroid carcinoma and follicular adenoma. The 3 CDR on chromosome 3p may harbor tumor suppressor genes involved in the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"[Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 3p in thyroid tumors].","pubmedId":"18956647"}
