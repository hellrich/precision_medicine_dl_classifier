We evaluated outcome according to FLT3/ITD status in 1135 adult patients treated according to United Kingdom Medical Research Council (UK MRC) AML protocols: 141 received an autograft, and 170 received a matched sibling allograft in first complete remission (CR). An FLT3/ITD was detected in 25% of patients and was an independent predictor for relapse (P \u003c .001). It remained prognostic for increased relapse in patients who received a transplant (odds ratio [OR] \u003d 1.91; 95% confidence intervals [CIs] \u003d 1.13-3.21; P \u003d .02), with no evidence of a difference in effect between patients who received an autograft (OR \u003d 2.39; CIs \u003d 1.24-4.62) and patients who received an allograft (OR \u003d 1.31; CIs \u003d 0.56-3.06) (test for interaction, P \u003d .3) or between patients who did or did not receive a transplant (P \u003d .4). These results were confirmed in an analysis of 186 patients randomized to receive or not receive an autograft in first CR and in a donor-versus-no donor analysis of 683 patients to assess the role of allograft (for latter, FLT3/ITD(-) OR \u003d 0.70, CIs \u003d 0.53-0.92; FLT3/ITD(+) OR \u003d 0.59, CIs \u003d 0.40-0.87; test for interaction, P \u003d .5). These results suggest that at present there is no strong evidence that FLT3 status should influence the decision to proceed to transplantation.","title":"No evidence that FLT3 status should be considered as an indicator for transplantation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML): an analysis of 1135 patients, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, from the UK MRC AML10 and 12 trials.","pubmedId":"16076872"}
