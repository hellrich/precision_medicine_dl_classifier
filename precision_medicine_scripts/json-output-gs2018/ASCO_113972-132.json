Quizartinib (AC220), an oral FLT3 inhibitor active against ITD mutant and wild type FLT3, has shown promising activity in Ph 1 and 2 studies.   Methods:  Patients (pts) in a Ph 2 open label study (N \u003d 333) of quizartinib monotherapy included 154 aged 60 y with known FLT3-ITD status and AML relapsed in \u003c1 y or refractory to 1st line chemotherapy.  Median duration of treatment was 14.2 wks (range 0.170.6 wks) for FLT3-ITD(+) pts and 9.5 wks (range 1.177.0 wks) for FLT3-ITD(-) pts. The composite complete remission (CRc) rate included complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), and complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi).  Results:   Of 110 FLT3-ITD(+) pts, 63 (57%) had a CRc (3 CR, 4 CRp, 56 CRi).  Of 44 FLT3-ITD(-) pts, 16 (36%) had a CRc (2 CR, 1 CRp, 13 CRi). Median overall survival (OS) in FLT3-ITD(+) pts was 25.3 wks and 16/110 (15%) survived \u003e52 wks.  The median age of these pts surviving \u003e52 wks was 69.5 y (range 6680 y) and median OS was 76.3 wks (range 56.996.0 wks). All of these pts responded to quizartinib (2 CR, 2 CRp, 8 CRi, 4 partial remission [PR]).  2 pts were still alive \u003e1  y (OS 93.0 and 96.0 wks). Median OS in FLT3-ITD(-) pts was 19.1 wks and 6/44 FLT3-ITD(-) pts (14%) survived  \u003e52 wks.  The median age of these pts was 70.0 y (range 6577 y) and their median survival was 76.6 wks (range 54.998.4 wks).  5 of these pts responded to quizartinib (1 CR, 3 CRi, 1 PR).   Conclusions:  These data for an FLT3-targeted agent show encouraging survival in a subset of elderly pts with relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD(+) AML.
