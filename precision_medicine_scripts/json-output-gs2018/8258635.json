Lactate dehydrogenase, lysozyme, total proteins, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, albumin and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) were measured in 24-h urine after 3 and 6 months of exposure. Body and kidney weight and chromium excretion were also examined. Except for the chromium excretion, no statistically significant changes were observed in the exposed male rats. In female rats there were significant increases in the urinary excretion of albumin after 3 and 6 months of exposure and the urinary excretion of beta 2-m after 3 months of exposure.","title":"Kidney function in male and female rats chronically exposed to potassium dichromate.","pubmedId":"8258635"}
