Two groups of two histopathologists each examined the cases blindly. One group had attended a short course in Germany, while the other group comprised two qualified histopathologists who had not had any special training. Each histopathologist reported the cases independently according to standard guidelines. Kappa statistics were applied.\nThe trained group of histopathologists showed agreement in 113 (94%) cases. Kappa value was calculated to be 0.96 which means \u0027perfect agreement. In contrast the untrained group showed agreement in 83 (69%) cases with a kappa value of 0.59 which means \u0027moderate agreement.\nInterobserver variability in immunohistochemical scoring of HER-2/neu in breast carcinoma is high among untrained general histopathologists. This may adversely affect the selection of patients with cancers who could benefit from Herceptin therapy.","title":"Interobserver variability in HER-2/neu reporting on immunohistochemistry in breast carcinomas.","pubmedId":"24640802"}
