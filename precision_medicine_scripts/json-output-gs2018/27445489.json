ALCL can sometimes involve the bone marrow, and in advanced stages, it can produce destructive extranodal lesions. But anaplastic large cell lymphoma kinase (ALK)+ ALCL with soft tissue involvement is very rare.\nA 35-year-old woman presented with waist pain for over 1 month. The biopsy of soft tissue lesions showed that these cells were positive for ALK-1, CD30, TIA-1, GranzymeB, CD4, CD8, and Ki67 (90%+) and negative for CD3, CD5, CD20, CD10, cytokeratin (CK), TdT, HMB-45, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and pan-CK, which identified ALCL. After six cycles of Hyper-CVAD/MA regimen, she achieved partial remission. Three months later, she died due to disease progression.\nThis case illustrates the unusual presentation of ALCL in soft tissue with a bad response to chemotherapy. Because of the tendency for rapid progression, ALCL in young adults with extra-nodal lesions are often treated with high-grade chemotherapy, such as Hyper-CVAD/MA.","title":"ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma with soft tissue involvement in a young woman.","pubmedId":"27445489"}
