We explored whether high level of erbB2 expression by cancer cells allows their targeting using an erbB2-binding peptide (LTVSPWY) attached to the proapoptotic alpha-tocopheryl succinate (alpha-TOS). Treating erbB2-low or erbB2-high cells with alpha-TOS induced similar levels of apoptosis, whereas alpha-TOS-LTVSPWY induced greater levels of apoptosis in erbB2-high cells. alpha-TOS rapidly accumulated in erbB2-high cells exposed to alpha-TOS-LTVSPWY. The extent of apoptosis induced in erbB2-high cells by alpha-TOS-LTVSPWY was suppressed by erbB2 RNA interference as well as by inhibition of either endocytotic or lysosomal function. alpha-TOS-LTVSPWY reduced erbB2-high breast carcinomas in FVB/N c-neu transgenic mice. We conclude that a conjugate of a peptide targeting alpha-TOS to erbB2-overexpressing cancer cells induces rapid apoptosis and efficiently suppresses erbB2-positive breast tumors.","title":"A peptide conjugate of vitamin E succinate targets breast cancer cells with high ErbB2 expression.","pubmedId":"17409443"}
