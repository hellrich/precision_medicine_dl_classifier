Among the three RAS isoforms - HRAS, KRAS and NRAS, KRAS is the most commonly mutated gene (in 86% of RAS-driven cancers) and the mutations are often detected in pancreatic, colorectal and lung cancers. RAS proteins function as molecular switches by alternating between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. The active or inactive state of RAS proteins is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). In the GTP-bound state, RAS proteins interact with a variety of effector proteins, such as Raf, PI3K, and RalGDS, leading to activation of several signaling cascades within the cell. In 98% of the cases, oncogenic RAS mutations are found at amino acid positions G12, G13, and Q61 which impair intrinsic and GAP-mediated GTPase function resulting in accumulation of constitutively GTP-bound RAS in cells. To gain insights into the effect of oncogenic mutations on overall structure and GTP hydrolysis, we solved high-resolution crystal structures of wild type and six oncogenic mutants (G12C, G12D, G12V, G13D, Q61L and Q61R) of KRAS4b in complex with GMPPNP (a non-hydrolysable GTP analog) and magnesium. Comparison of GDP and GMPPNP bound structures of wild type (WT) KRAS4b suggests conformational changes that occur when KRAS4b transitions from inactive to active state. Comparison of mutant and wild-type KRAS structures has shown the appearance of new pockets in some cases that could be exploited for structure-based drug design. Structural superposition of mutants vs. wild type KRAS4b in complex with GMPPNP/Mg2+, and KRAS4b mutants vs. WT-HRAS bound to RASA1-GAP provides a rationale for impaired intrinsic and GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis in the KRAS mutants.","title":"Structural basis of impaired GTP hydrolysis in oncogenic mutants of KRAS.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-1366"}
