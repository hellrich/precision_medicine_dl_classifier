The molecular mechanisms underlying esophageal cancer are very complicated and have not yet been completely clarified. In recent years, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play critical regulatory roles in various cancer biology, yet their potential involvement in esophageal cancer is not well understood. Here, we identified a set of lncRNAs that are differentially expressed in esophageal cancer tissues in comparison to the normal tissues using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A new lncRNA, which we name XY11-10-11, is significanty increased in expression in human esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues and cell lines. XY11-10-11 is an intergenic lncRNA expressed from a locus located on chromosome 14. Importantly, knockdown of XY11-10-11 by siRNA resulted in inhibition of proliferation and migration in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells (EACs). Moreover, patients with high XY11-10-11 expression levels had a relatively poorer prognosis. Our findings indicate that XY11-10-11 may play a significant role in the development or progression of esophageal adenocarcinoma and may be an potential biomarker for diagnosis and therapy.","title":"Long noncoding RNA XY11-10-11 regulates proliferation and migration of esophageal adenocarcinoma cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-190"}
