Pediatric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is cytogenetically different from DLBCL in adults, suggesting a different disease in children. Microarray studies demonstrate three types of T-cell leukemia, the leukemic counterpart of LBL, that block T-cell differentiation at different stages of T-cell development, corresponding to LYL, TAL1, and HOX-expressing leukemias. ALCL cell lines have a unique expression profile compared to normal T-cells. Germinal centers of BL have CMYC expression signatures, indicating that CMYC expression is ectopic and does not reflect the physiology of the normal cell counterpart.\nAdditional cytogenetic, molecular and microarray investigations of NHL in children are vital to better understand these diseases, their etiology, and differences from adult NHL. A greater understanding of pediatric NHL will lead to disease-specific and patient-individualized therapies of these diseases.","title":"State of the Art and Future Needs in Cytogenetic/Molecular Genetics/Arrays in childhood lymphoma: summary report of workshop at the First International Symposium on childhood and adolescent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, April 9, 2003, New York City, NY.","pubmedId":"16127683"}
