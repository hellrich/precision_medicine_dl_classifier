Active TB was identified by bacteria-positive, biopsy or autopsy. Infection was confirmed to the lung, pleura, lymph node and miliary lesions and 7 patients had open tuberculosis. In half of the patients, chest X-ray films demonstrated unusual findings in adult tuberculosis: lower lung field pneumonia and miliary pattern. All the patients suffered from severe underlying diseases and an intensive therapy with steroid, immunosuppressive agents, antitumor drugs, radiation and operation was found as predisposing factors for TB occurrence. Nine patients recovered from current infection with anti-tuberculosis drugs; 14 patients died and TB directly caused death in 8 patients. These data strongly suggest that TB is one of the most important infections in compromised hosts. We emphasize that this infection presents a serious clinical problem in a general hospital today.","title":"Hospital-onset tuberculosis in compromised host.","pubmedId":"1392174"}
