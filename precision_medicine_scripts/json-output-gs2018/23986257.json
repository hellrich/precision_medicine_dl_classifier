In general, tumor growth requires disruption of the tissue microenvironment, yet how this affects glioma progression is unknown. We studied program death-ligand (PD-L)1 in neurons and gliomas in tumors from GBM patients and associated the findings with clinical outcome. Remarkably, we found that upregulation of PD-L1 by neurons in tumor-adjacent brain tissue (TABT) associated positively with GBM patient survival, whereas lack of neuronal PD-L1 expression was associated with high PD-L1 in tumors and unfavorable prognosis. To understand the molecular mechanism of PD-L1 signaling in neurons, we investigated PD-L1 function in cerebellar and cortical neurons and its impact on gliomas. We discovered that neuronal PD-L1-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of glioma cells. Because interferon (IFN)-Î² induces PD-L1 expression, we studied the functional consequences of neuronal Ifnb gene deletion on PD-L1 signaling and function. Ifnb-/- neurons lacked PD-L1 and were defective in inducing glioma cell death; this effect was reversed on PD-L1 gene transfection. Ifnb-/- mice with intracerebral isografts survived poorly. Similar to the observations in GBM patients, better survival in wild-type mice was associated with high neuronal PD-L1 in TABT and downregulation of PD-L1 in tumors, which was defective in Ifnb-/- mice. Our data indicated that neuronal PD-L1 signaling in brain cells was important for GBM patient survival. Reciprocal PD-L1 regulation in TABT and tumor tissue could be a prognostic biomarker for GBM. Understanding the complex interactions between tumor and adjacent stromal tissue is important in designing targeted GBM therapies.","title":"PD-L1 expression by neurons nearby tumors indicates better prognosis in glioblastoma patients.","pubmedId":"23986257"}
