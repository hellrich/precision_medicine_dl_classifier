The clinical, histological and epidemiological characteristics of 49 patients, identified from 2470 with histologically confirmed melanoma, are described in this study. Thirty-five of these patients had two primary melanomas, 11 had three melanomas and three had four, five and six melanomas, respectively. Diagnosis was concurrent in 22 patients (45%); in the remaining cases the median time interval between the first and second melanoma was 22.6 months and the longest interval was 21.5 years. The mean Breslow\u0027s thickness decreased significantly (P \u003c 0.001) from the first melanoma to the second and third lesion. The multiple melanoma patients had a higher percentage of subjects over 70 years of age or with lentigo maligna melanoma than single melanoma patients. The mean follow-up time was 12 years (range 4 23 years). The 5-year survival rate from first melanoma excision (83%) does not differ from that of patients with a single melanoma. In conclusion, the presence of multiple primary melanomas does not appear to be a negative prognostic factor; our data show the importance of close follow-up in melanoma patients in order to detect not only metastases, but also subsequent primaries in their earliest phases.","title":"Multiple primary melanomas: analysis of 49 cases.","pubmedId":"9764812"}
