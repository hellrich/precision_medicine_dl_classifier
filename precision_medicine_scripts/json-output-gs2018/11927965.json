Recently, 2 studies reported a 95% prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangements in histologically benign tissue affected by HT, suggesting that multiple occult tumors exist in HT patients with high frequency. We tested the prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangements in 26 HT, in 6 papillary carcinomas arising in the background of HT, and in 27 papillary carcinomas not associated with HT. We detected no RET/PTC rearrangements in HT or papillary carcinomas arising in the background of HT, in contrast to a 33% prevalence among papillary carcinomas not associated with HT. However, the expression of wild-type RET was found in more than half of papillary carcinomas. These results suggest that, if the association between HT and thyroid cancer exists, its molecular basis is different from RET/PTC rearrangement.","title":"Prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangements in Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis and papillary thyroid carcinomas.","pubmedId":"11927965"}
