Molecular analysis revealed a FOXP1-ABL1 fusion for the t(3;9) and a SNX2-ABL1 fusion for the t(5;9). The fusions were confirmed by specific amplification of the genomic breakpoints using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The identification of ALL with rare ABL1 fusion partners is important because the leukaemia may respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the same way as ALL patients with a classical BCR-ABL1 fusion gene.","title":"Identification of FOXP1 and SNX2 as novel ABL1 fusion partners in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","pubmedId":"21391972"}
