Although the Granite trial did not show any benefit of everolimus over best supportive care in patients with advanced gastric cancer, preclinical combinations of platinum chemotherapy and mTOR inhibition have shown a synergistic effect.  We conducted a phase 1 trial combining mFOLFOX6 with everolimus.  Methods:  Patients with metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal and esophageal adenocarcinoma were eligible.  A standard 3+3 design was employed and patients received standard dose mFOLFOX6 and escalating doses of everolimus ranging from 2.5 to10 mg/day.  Patients were evaluated for dose limiting toxicities during the first 4 weeks of treatment.  Tumor tissue was collected for next generation sequencing.  Results:  Six patients were accrued to the first dose level of everolimus at 2.5 mg daily, four with metastatic gastric cancer and 2 with metastatic esophageal cancer.  Two dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at the first dose level with one patient being hospitalized for fever secondary to a possible infection.  The second patient developed grade 2 neutropenia that resulted in a treatment delay greater than 7 days.  Toxicities were manageable with mucositis, nausea, neutropenia, fatigue and rash being the most common.  Five patients required everolimus dose reduction during their course of treatment.  The median time to treatment failure was 8.9 months.  Next generation sequencing revealed mutations in APC, EGFR, FGFR3, FLT3, KDR, KIT, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, RET, STK11 and TP53.  Conclusions:  The immunosuppressive effect of chemotherapy in combination with everolimus resulted in two DLTs at the first dose level.  One patient that required dose reductions due to mucositis had a FLT3 mutation which more commonly occurs in acute myelogenous leukemia.  A FLT3 genotype variant associated with the development of pneumonitis in renal cell carcinoma patients treated with mTOR inhibitors was previously reported (Y. Urun, et al, ASCO 2013).  Further research is needed to identify biomarkers of treatment response and toxicity.
