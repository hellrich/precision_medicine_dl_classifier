Maximal static pressures on inspiration and expiration were generated near residual volume (RV), at functional residual capacity (FRC) and near total lung capacity (TLC). Lung volumes were measured by body plethysmography. The expected increase in lung volumes was present in the swimmers and was most marked in the oldest subjects. However, training did not have the anticipated effect on Pmax. In the younger swimmers training was associated with an increase in Pmax, but in the older swimmers Pmax was actually decreased in comparison to controls. These findings suggest that training may directly enhance lung growth, since the changes in lung volume cannot be accounted for by increases in respiratory muscle strength.","title":"Maximal static pressures and lung volumes in young female swimmers.","pubmedId":"3704390"}
