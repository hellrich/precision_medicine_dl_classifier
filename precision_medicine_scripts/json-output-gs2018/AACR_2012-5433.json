A large population-based cohort study was conducted to assess the effect of dietary factors on the risk of EC in Korean adults. Methods: The data for this study came from the National Health Insurance Corporation Study (NHICS), Korean Central Cancer Registry. The participants aged 30-80 years were 822,745 Korean men and 368,918 women, cancer-free at baseline in 1996 and 1997, and were followed up to December 31, 2007. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the HR were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: During the follow-up period, crude incidence rates per 100,000 person-years for EC were 8.1 in overall total population, 11.1 in men, and 1.2 in women. In the total population, the estimated HRs (95% CI) for meat consumption of more than 4 times per week compared with consumption of less than once per week were 1.267 (1.018-1.577) with a p value of 0.0337. In men only groups, the HRs (95% CI) for those who had irregular meal patterns compared with those with regular meal patterns were 1.359 (1.087-1.699) with a p value of 0.0071. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that dietary factors may be associated with the risk of EC.","title":"Dietary factors and the risk of esophageal cancer: A population-based cohort study in Korea","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5433"}
