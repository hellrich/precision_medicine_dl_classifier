Moreover, mutations in NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and WT1 were analyzed, and mRNA expression of IDH1 was quantified.\nIDH1 R132 mutations were found in 10.9% of CN-AML patients. IDH1 SNP rs11554137 was found in 12% of CN-AML patients and 11.7% of healthy volunteers. IDH1 R132 mutations had no impact on prognosis. In contrast, IDH1 SNP rs11554137 was an adverse prognostic factor for overall survival in univariate and multivariate analysis. Other significant factors were age, NPM1/FLT3 mutational status, WT1 SNP rs16754, and platelet count. The impact of IDH1 SNP rs11554137 was most pronounced in the NPM1/FLT3 high-risk patients (either NPM1 wild-type or FLT3-internal tandem duplication positive). Patients with IDH1 SNP rs11554137 had a higher expression of IDH1 mRNA than patients with two wild-type alleles.\nIDH1 SNP rs11554137 but not IDH1 R132 mutations are associated with an inferior outcome in CN-AML.","title":"Impact of IDH1 R132 mutations and an IDH1 single nucleotide polymorphism in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia: SNP rs11554137 is an adverse prognostic factor.","pubmedId":"20368538"}
