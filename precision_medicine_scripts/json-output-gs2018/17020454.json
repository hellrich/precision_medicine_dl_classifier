It is supposed that cytokine alterations in immune, inflammatory and angiogenetic regulatory routes within the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma microenvironment play a critical role in tumor aggressiveness, its response to chemo- and radiation therapies, as well as the development of immune escape mechanisms.","title":"Role of cytokines in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17020454"}
