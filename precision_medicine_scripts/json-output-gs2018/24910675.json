New histological diagnosis was made on freshly prepared H\u0026E sections followed by application and analysis of immunostains.\nThe mean age of the patients was 44 Â± 15 (mean SD) (range; 17-86) years. There were 26 male and 24 female patients with a male to female ratio of 1.08:1. Fourteen cases of PA, 14 cases of AdCC and 6 cases of PLGA were positive for CD117. In case of GFAP, only 9 cases of AdCC and 3 cases of PLGA were positive; however, 16 cases of PA were also positive. Twelve cases of AdCC and 7 cases of PA were positive for SMA and half of the PLGA cases were also reactive. Nonetheless, the least expression was seen in case of CD 43, where only five cases of AdCC were positive. Six cases of PA and three cases of PLGA were also positive.\nOur results suggest that the use of GFAP, SMA, CD 117 and CD 43 as an adjunct to histological examination is not helpful in differentiating PA, AdCC and PLGA from one another.","title":"Immunohistochemical pattern of pleomorphic adenoma, polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma in minor salivary glands.","pubmedId":"24910675"}
