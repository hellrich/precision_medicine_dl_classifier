A further radiological investigation found suspicious areas within both thyroid lobes that were later diagnosed as foci of papillary and medullary thyroid carcinomas. Appropriate treatment was commenced. Reports of similar occurrences of synchronous thyroid and parathyroid pathologies are discussed.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first reported case of two synchronous thyroid cancers occurring in the context of primary hyperparathyroidism. We strongly recommend a thorough radiological investigation of all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism to prevent missing concurrent thyroid cancers.","title":"Association of synchronous medullary and papillary thyroid carcinomas with primary hyperparathyroidism: first case report and literature review.","pubmedId":"24877696"}
