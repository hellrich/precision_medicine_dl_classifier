G2677T, C1236T, and C3435T of the ABCB1 gene were analyzed by the allele-specific matrix-assisted laser desorption. Expression of ABCB1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was tested in 101 patients of known genotype and haplotype for ABCB1 polymorphisms. Basic clinical characteristics of these patients were collected from medical records.\nSurvival analysis showed that patients with AML (TTT haplotype) had a longer overall survival (OS) (p \u003c 0.001, 29.2 months, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 26.9-31.5 months) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (p \u003d 0.005, 21.8 months, 95 % CI, 19.5-24.0 months) compared with those without TTT haplotype (21.9 months, 95 % CI, 19.6-24.2 months; 16.5 months, 95 % CI, 14.6-18.5 months). After adjusting for age; gender; leukocyte count; hemoglobin level; platelet levels; French, American, and British classification; lactate dehydrogenase levels; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; nucleophosmin gene; and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 gene, the multivariate survival analysis showed that the TTT haplotype appeared to be a predicting factor for OS (p \u003d 0.001, hazard ratio \u003d 1.854, 95 % CI, 1.301-2.641) and RFS (p \u003d 0.009, hazard ratio \u003d 1.755, 95 % CI, 1.153-2.671). Moreover, a significant association between the TTT haplotype and relapse in AML patients was observed in this study (p \u003d 0.002, odds ratio \u003d 0.410, 95 % CI, 0.235-0.715). Gene expression level was significantly lower in patients with the TTT haplotype than in the patients with the other haplotypes (p \u003d 0.004).\nThe findings suggested the TTT haplotype was possibly related to the OS, RFS, and relapse in Chinese patients with AML.","title":"Association of ABCB1 polymorphisms with prognostic outcomes of anthracycline and cytarabine in Chinese patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"25567217"}
