However, mechanisms behind the atRA-induced apoptosis have not been studied. In this study, we used a similar cell culture model system of matched primary and metastatic melanoma cells from the same patient to investigate whether p53 and bcl-2 family proteins were involved in atRA-induced apoptosis. The primary and metastatic melanoma cells were exposed to 0.1 and 10 micro M atRA in serum-free RPMI 1640 cell culture medium in the dark for up to 96 h. The protein expression of p53, p21, bax and bcl-2 were examined by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Expression of p53, p21 and bax was increased, and bcl-2 was decreased in melanoma cells after exposure to atRA at different concentrations for various periods of time. The changes of p53, p21, bax, and bcl-2 protein levels were dose- and time-dependent. The primary melanoma cells were more sensitive to the atRA treatments than cells from matched metastatic melanoma. These data indicate that p53, p21, bax and bcl-2 proteins were involved in atRA-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. Modification of these protein levels in the tumour cells might be beneficial for early treatment of melanoma.","title":"Expression profiles of p53, p21, bax and bcl-2 proteins in all-trans-retinoic acid treated primary and metastatic melanoma cells.","pubmedId":"15254726"}
