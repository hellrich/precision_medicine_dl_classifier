The association of HER-2 expression with overall survival(OS) was examined. The state 12.0 version software was used for meta-analysis. The quality of these studies were assessed using the Newcasthe-Ottawa scale.\nThere were nine studies meeting the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis including 4787 cases and the scores of all studies are more than 6 points. Meta-analysis showed no significant heterogeneity (I(2)\u003d10.6%, P\u003d0.347) among these studies. There was no significant difference in overall survival between positive HER-2 and negative HER-2 patients (HR\u003d1.16, 95% CI:0.97-1.38, P\u003d0.114).\nHER-2 overexpression in the tumor is not identified as a significant prognostic factor in patients with resectable gastric cancer.","title":"[Prognostic role of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in resectable gastric cancer: a meta-analysis].","pubmedId":"25656031"}
