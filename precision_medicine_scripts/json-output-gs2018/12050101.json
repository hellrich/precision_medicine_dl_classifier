We examined archival tissue samples of 100 DCIS lesions with an invasive component (cases) and 100 without an invasive component (controls), with cases and controls matched by pathologic nuclear grade. HER-2/neu gene amplification was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We compared HER-2/neu gene amplification in DCIS lesions only, irrespective of the presence or absence of an invasive component. HER-2/neu gene amplification occurred significantly less frequently in the cases (26%) than in the controls (40%), with an odds ratio of 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.72; P \u003c 0.004) after adjustment for pathologic and quantitative-image-analyzed morphometric nuclear grade. The HER-2/neu gene also was amplified more frequently in higher- than in lower-grade DCIS alone (56% versus 19%, respectively; P \u003c 0.0001) or in higher- than in lower-grade DCIS with invasive cancer (44% versus 2%, respectively; P \u003c 0.00001). Future studies should examine the potential roles of HER-2/neu and other biomarkers (e.g., p21 and Rb) as markers of the risk of DCIS patients for invasive breast cancer and as molecular targets of chemoprevention in breast intraepithelial neoplasia.","title":"Her-2/neu gene amplification in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.","pubmedId":"12050101"}
