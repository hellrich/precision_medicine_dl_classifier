To model inhibition of this pathway in lymphoma, mice with T-lymphocyte-specific, constitutively active AKT (Lck-MyrAkt2) were crossed to mice with genetically reduced mTOR expression (knock-down, KD). Mice with genetic reduction of mTOR had increased survival by 10 weeks relative to wild type mTOR mice, though both developed thymic pre-T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pre-T LBL). Similarly, when mTOR wild type Lck-MyrAkt2 mice were treated for 8 weeks with the rapamycin analog, everolimus, an inhibitor of the mTOR TORC1 complex, survival was also increased. Gene expression profiling of thymic lymphomas from the mice revealed that mTOR KD was associated with decreased expression of Cdk6, a critical proliferative control node in T-cell development and oncogenic transformation. Pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR in tumor cells also decreased CDK6. The combination of a mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) and a CDK4/6 inhibitor (PD-0332991, Palbociclib) synergistically decreased the overall viability and signaling downstream of drug targets in mouse lymphoma cells and in human T-ALL/LBL cell lines. This combination was also evaluated in mice using a disseminated leukemia model. In vivo treatment with this combination not only reduced tumor size by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and arresting tumor cell cycle, but also increased overall survival. We are currently validating upstream regulators of Cdk6 as well as downstream targets in the pre-T LBL tumors from the mTOR deficient mice.","title":"Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR delays mortality due to thymc lymphoma formation in mice and is associated with decreases in cell cycle proteins","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2833"}
