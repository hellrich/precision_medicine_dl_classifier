The aim of the present study is to investigate the frequency of MET overexpression, the correlated clinicopathologic features and the possible treatments in NSCLC with AR. Methods:  Advanced NSCLC patients with AR to EGFR TKIs were detected for MET overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). 50% tumor cells with moderate to high intensity staining were defined as MET positive.  MET positive patients were recommended to participate a clinical trial if eligible or receive other molecularly targeted therapies. The statuses of EGFR, ALK, KRAS and ROS1 were also tested.  Results:  From January 2013 to January 2014, 58 advanced NSCLC patients with AR to gefitinib or erlotinib were enrolled prospectively. The frequencies of MET overexpression was 32.8% (19/58), MET overexpression+T790M 6.9% (4/58), T790M 29.3% (17/58), small cell lung cancer or squamous cell transformation 3.4% (2/58), KRAS mutation 1.7% (1/58), ROS1 fusion 1.7% (1/58) and unknown mechanism 24.1% (14/58),  respectively. No significant differencies were found in terms of clinicopathologic features (age, gender, smoking, performance status, histology, clinical stage, EGFR mutation types, and lines of EGFR TKIs), response rate of EGFR TKIs (69.6% versus 74.3%, p\u003d0.694) and median progression-free survival (10.6 versus 13.0 months, p\u003d0.569 ) for EGFR TKIs between MET positive and negative patients. Five of MET positive patients received gefitinib plus crizotinib (3 cases; 2 of them attaining partial response [PR] and 1 waiting for assessment of response), crizotinib (one case waiting for assessment) and axitinib (one case achieving PR) treatment, and all got prominently clinical benefit.  Conclusions:  MET overexpression is one of common molecular mechanisms of AR to EGFR TKIs and has no correlated clinicopathologic features in NSCLC, but might serve as a promising therapeutic target when gefitinib plus crizotinib or other targeted therapy is provided.","title":"MET overexpression as a promising therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.","pubmedId":"ASCO_131452-144"}
