We previously showed that non-V600 BRAF mutations account for 12% of all BRAF mutations in melanoma. Limited clinical data are available for non-V600 BRAF mutant melanomas. To better understand non-V600 BRAF mutations in melanoma, characteristics of tumor and clinical outcomes were investigated.  Methods:  Clinical and pathologic data were collected retrospectively in patients (pts) with melanoma who had multi-gene mutation analysis (next-gene sequencing) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Fisher\u0027s exact test was used for all comparisons.  Results:  We found 52 pts with non-V600 BRAF mutations, among whom 8 had NRAS/non-V600 co-mutations. Common non-V600 mutations were K601E (17.3%), G469E (15.4%), G469R (7.7%), D594G (5.8%), L597S (5.8%), and S467L (5.8%). Compared with V600E mutations as a control (n\u003d82) , the presence of a non-V600 mutations was significantly associated with older age (median, 58 years vs 50; P\u003d0.001), less superficial spreading type (13.6% vs 32.9%; P\u003d0.02), more lentigo maligna type (20% vs 1.2%; P\u003d0.001), more mucosal subtype (9.1% vs 1.2%; P\u003d0.03), more head/neck primary tumor location (36.4% vs 15.9%; P\u003d0.03), less lower extremity primary tumor location (4.5% vs 24.4%; P\u003d0.003), more co-mutations with NRAS (15.4% vs 2.4%, p\u003d0.005) and stage IV disease at initial diagnosis (31.8% vs 7.3%; P\u003d0.0003).  Among the 33 pts with non-V600 mutant metastatic melanoma, 7 received selective BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi). Of the 5 evaluable patients (2 could not tolerate treatment), all had disease progression within 2 months.  Conclusions:  Non-V600 BRAF mutant melanomas have more aggressive clinical characteristics, more likely to have co-mutations with NRAS, and not responsive to selective BRAFi than V600E mutations.  A larger cohort and a longer follow-up will better define the prognostic indication of non-V600 mutated melanoma.","title":"Clinical characteristics of patients with non-V600 BRAF mutant melanomas.","pubmedId":"ASCO_135042-144"}
