We investigated the connection between angiogenesis and FGF/FGFR expression including FGFR3 mutation status in urothelial carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry was performed in invasive and non-invasive urothelial cancers of 61 patients. Protein expression of CD31, factor VIII (FVIII), FGF-1/2, FGFR1, FGFR3 and FGFR4 and FGFR3 mutation status were evaluated. Morphometric assessment of angiogenesis including microvessel count (MVC) and vascular surface area (VSA) was analysed. Correlation and survival analyses (overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)) with univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. CD31 values (MVC and VSA) significantly correlated with OS and DFS. OS and DFS were significantly better in patients with FGFR3 overexpression. Multivariate analysis revealed FGFR3 protein expression and tumour grading (WHO classification 2004) as independent prognostic factors of OS and VSA of CD31 and FGFR3 protein expression of DFS. FGFR3 mutation status was correlated with VSA measured by FVIII. FGFR3 may be able to induce a pro-angiogenic phenotype in urothelial carcinomas and significantly influence prognosis. Consequently, FGFR3 is a potential therapeutic target also from the angiogenesis perspective.","title":"Increased angiogenesis and FGFR protein expression indicate a favourable prognosis in bladder cancer.","pubmedId":"25326864"}
