In total cases, in a multivariate model using logistic stepwise regression analysis, venous invasion was significantly and independently related to lung metastasis in patients who underwent curative resection. Integrin alpha v, c-erbB2 and DNA ploidy in primary tumors were not predictable for lung metastasis. On the other hand, in the 21 patients with lung metastases, integrin alpha v overexpression was identified in 52.4% (11/21) of primary tumors and in 85.7% (18/21) of lung metastases, respectively. The positive ratio was significantly higher in lung metastases than in primary tumors (p \u003c 0.05). There was no significant difference between primary tumors and lung metastases in DNA ploidy or c-erbB2 expression.\nIntegrin alpha v might be one of the important signals for formation of lung metastases from colorectal cancer as a late event.","title":"Integrin alpha v, c-erbB2 and DNA ploidy in lung metastases from colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"12629984"}
