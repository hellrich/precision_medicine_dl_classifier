A 60% incidence of HIV infection was seen in this study population, with SCC presenting as the initial manifestation of HIV infection in 2 of the 6 patients. In addition. HIV-infected patients were significantly younger than non-infected patients at (p \u003d 0.01). None of the HIV-infected patients had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at the time of presentation, but 5 of 6 patients had an abnormal CD4 count, compared to none of the non-infected patients (p \u003d 0.05). The absolute CD4 count in HIV-infected patients decreased to less than 100x10(9)/L in the majority of these patients within 3 months of presentation with HNSCC (p \u003d 0.05). Treatment-associated complications were common in HIV-infected patients, occurring in 4 of the 6 cases in contrast to none of the patients without HIV infection (p \u003d 0.046). Outcome was significantly poorer for HIV-Infected patients, with 5 patients succumbing to their disease within one year, in contrast to none of the non-infected patients (p \u003d 0.046). These data, combined with our previous work, justify further investigation of the relationship between HNSCC and HIV infection and the possibility of its inclusion as an AIDS-defining process.","title":"Alterations in head and neck cancer occurring in HIV-infected patients--results of a pilot, longitudinal, prospective study.","pubmedId":"10665761"}
