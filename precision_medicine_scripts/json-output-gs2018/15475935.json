Arachidonic acid and its derivatives including prostaglandins (PG) and thromboxane along with the enzymes involved in their synthesis have been shown to influence the growth of various tumors. We analyzed the immunoreactivity for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and mRNA expression levels of the enzymes COX-2, thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) synthase, and PGI(2) synthase by RT-PCR in papillary carcinomas and matching normal tissues to determine the role of these enzymes in the development of papillary thyroid carcinomas. A papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line TPC-1 was also studied in vitro to determine the role of the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 on COX-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, since COX-2 also has a role in regulating tumor angiogenesis. RT-PCR analysis showed significant increases in TXA(2) synthase mRNA levels in papillary thyroid carcinomas compared to normal thyroid tissues. Although COX-2 mRNA levels were generally increased in papillary carcinomas, the differences were not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in PGI(2) synthase mRNA levels. COX-2 protein expression was greater in papillary carcinoma compared to normal thyroid tissues; however, the levels were quite variable. In vitro studies with a COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, showed inhibition of tumor growth along with increased levels of COX-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A mRNA expression. These results indicate that specific enzyme levels in the PG synthesis pathway such as TXA(2) synthase are increased in papillary thyroid carcinomas. COX-2 also has a role in papillary thyroid growth, since a specific inhibitor of COX-2 regulates papillary thyroid carcinoma cell proliferation. These results implicate several enzymes in the synthesis of prostanoids as regulators of thyroid papillary carcinoma proliferation and suggest that increased levels of expression of these enzymes may play a role in the pathogenesis of these tumors.","title":"Role of COX-2, thromboxane A2 synthase, and prostaglandin I2 synthase in papillary thyroid carcinoma growth.","pubmedId":"15475935"}
