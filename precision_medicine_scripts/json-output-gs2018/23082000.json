AZD4547 displayed a highly selective profile across a lung cell line panel, potently inhibiting cell growth only in those lines harboring amplified FGFR1 (GI(50) \u003d 0.003-0.111 Î¼mol/L). AZD4547 induced potent tumor stasis or regressive effects in four of five FGFR1-amplified squamous NSCLC PDTX models. Pharmacodynamic modulation was observed in vivo, and antitumor efficacy correlated well with FGFR1 FISH score and protein expression level.\nThis study provides novel epidemiologic data through identification of FGFR1 gene amplification in Chinese NSCLC specimens (particularly squamous) and, importantly, extends the clinical significance of this finding by using multiple FGFR1-amplified squamous lung cancer PDTX models to show tumor stasis or regression effects using a specific FGFR inhibitor (AZD4547). Thus, the translational science presented here provides a strong rationale for investigation of AZD4547 as a therapeutic option for patients with squamous NSCLC tumors harboring amplification of FGFR1.","title":"Translating the therapeutic potential of AZD4547 in FGFR1-amplified non-small cell lung cancer through the use of patient-derived tumor xenograft models.","pubmedId":"23082000"}
