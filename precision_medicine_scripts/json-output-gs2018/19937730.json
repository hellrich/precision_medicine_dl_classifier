Until recently, very little was known about the underlying biology and molecular genetics of these tumors. However, within the past year a number of studies have shown that the MAPK pathway is constitutively activated in a high proportion of LGAs. Several genetic aberrations which generate this deregulation of the MAPK pathway have been identified, most notably gene fusions between KIAA1549 and BRAF. In this review we summarize these findings, discuss how these gene fusions may arise and consider possible implications for diagnosis and treatment.","title":"MAPK pathway activation and the origins of pediatric low-grade astrocytomas.","pubmedId":"19937730"}
