We report a single-center study among patients treated within a Temporary Authorization for Use (TAU) protocol. We also performed a review of the literature involving expanded access program studies with a focus on factors associated with overall survival (OS).\nThis retrospective, observational study included patients between June 2010 and July 2011 with a diagnosis of non-resectable stage III or IV melanoma with at least one previous line of chemotherapy. Treatment consisted of four courses of ipilimumab at a dose of 3mg/kg every three weeks.\n45 patients were included, among whom 23 (51%) had brain metastases. 33 (71%) of the patients completed the induction phase. The best overall response rate (BORR) was 13% and median overall survival (OS) was 8 months (95%CI: 7 to 12). OS was not different between patients with brain metastases at baseline and those without (p \u003d 0.10), regardless of BRAF V600E status (p \u003d 0.61). OS was poorer in patients who were being treated with corticoids at baseline (p\u003c0.001) or with LDH at baseline \u003e 500 UI/ml (p \u003d 0.008).\nA subset of patients most likely to benefit from ipilimumab should be defined. In our series we found a negative association of baseline corticosteroids with OS. Unlike high LDH levels, BRAF V600 E status and brain metastases should not be barriers to the initiation of treatment.","title":"Single-center study under a French Temporary Authorization for Use (TAU) protocol for ipilimumab in metastatic melanoma: negative impact of baseline corticosteroids.","pubmedId":"25500362"}
