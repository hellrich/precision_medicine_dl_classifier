Involvement of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) locus has been demonstrated, by linkage analysis, for three families with SNF. In one of them, a cosegregating frameshift mutation in exon 46 of the NF1 gene was identified. In the present study, we report four individuals from two families who carry NF1 null mutations that would be expected to cause NF1. Three patients have multiple spinal tumors and no café-au-lait macules, and the fourth has no clinical signs of NF1. In the first family, a missense mutation (Leu2067Pro) in NF1 exon 33 was found, and, in the second, a splice-site mutation (IVS31-5A--\u003eG) enlarging exon 32 by 4 bp at the 5\u0027 end was found. The latter mutation has also been observed in an unrelated patient with classical NF1. Both NF1 mutations cause a reduction in neurofibromin of approximately 50%, with no truncated protein present in the cells. This demonstrates that typical NF1 null mutations can result in a phenotype that is distinct from classical NF1, showing only a small spectrum of the NF1 symptoms, such as multiple spinal tumors, but not completely fitting the current clinical criteria for SNF. We speculate that this phenotype is caused by an unknown modifying gene that compensates for some, but not all, of the effects caused by neurofibromin deficiency.","title":"Spinal neurofibromatosis without café-au-lait macules in two families with null mutations of the NF1 gene.","pubmedId":"11704931"}
