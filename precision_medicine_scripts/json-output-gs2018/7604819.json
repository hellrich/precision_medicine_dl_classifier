Of these, three patients were diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome complicated by disseminated Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, incompletely treated Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and disseminated histoplasmosis respectively. The fourth patient had non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma of the mature T-cell phenotype. Fever, bicytopenia, or pancytopenia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (\u003e 1,000 IU/L), and hemophagocytic histiocytosis in smears of bone marrow aspirate were present in all patients. Hyperferritinemia (\u003e 10,000 ng/ml) was present in all (range 34,976 to 425,984 ng/mL) and showed a decrease in the two patients who responded to therapy. Hyperferritinemia (\u003e 10,000 ng/ml) and elevated serum LDH (\u003e 1,000 IU/L) are important clues to the diagnosis of RHPS in the febrile cytopenic patient with immunodeficiency.","title":"Hyperferritinemia in reactive hemophagocytic syndrome report of four adult cases.","pubmedId":"7604819"}
