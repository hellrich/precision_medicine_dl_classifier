The aim of this study was to screen for mutations in these genes in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and to explore their correlations with certain clinicopathological parameters. We tested mutations in the KRAS (exons 2, 3 and 4), NRAS (exons 2, 3 and 4), PIK3CA (exon 20) and BRAF (exon 15) genes using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing in a large cohort of 1,110 Chinese CRC patients who underwent surgical resection at one of three major teaching hospitals located in different regions of China. The prevalence rates of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were 45.4%, 3.9%, 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively. Mutant KRAS was associated with the mucinous subtype and greater differentiation, while mutant BRAF was associated with right-sided tumors and poorer differentiation. Our results revealed differences in the genetic profiles of KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF at mutation hotspots between Chinese CRC patients and those of Western countries, while some of these gene features were shared among patients from other Asian countries.
