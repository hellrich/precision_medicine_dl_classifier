Elevated JAK/STAT signalling leading to increased activation of STAT3 is reported in a wide variety of cancers, including breast, liver, prostate, colorectal, head and neck, oesophageal, pancreatic, bladder, and non-small cell lung, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Overall, up to 70% of human tumours are linked to persistent elevated STAT3 activity which can be associated with poorer prognosis in many of these settings. In addition, elevated pSTAT3 is observed in response to chemotherapy treatment, and also in response to treatment with inhibitors of oncogenic signalling pathways such as EGFR, MAPK and AKT, and is associated with resistance or poorer response to agents targeting these pathways. In many of these cases, JAK1 is believed to be a primary driver of STAT3 phosphorylation and signalling, suggesting inhibition of JAKs as a therapeutic approach to treat these potential resistance mechanisms. The mixed JAK1/2 kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib is approved for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms including intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera and has been tested in a variety of tumor settings. Since JAK2 is essential for the signal transduction downstream of erythropoietin, thrombopoietin and related receptors that control erythrocyte and megakaryocyte expansion, dosing of inhibitors that target JAK2 can be limited by toxicities such as thrombocytopenia and anaemia.Starting from a non-kinome selective screening hit, structure-based design was used to optimise a series of aminopyrimidines that led to JAK1-selective candidate drug AZD4205. This compound demonstrates ATP competitive binding with IC50’s in a high ATP concentration enzyme assay against JAK1 of 73 nM (Ki \u003d 2.8 nM), with high selectivity against JAK2 and JAK3 with IC50’s of 13,233 nM and \u003e30,000 nM respectively. In addition it showed potent inhibition of p-STAT3 in a cell based assay of JAK1 activity with an IC50 of 128 nM and excellent selectivity across the kinome. In summary, AZD4205 is a highly potent JAK1-selective kinase inhibitor with excellent preclinical pharmacokinetics with potential for further clinical development. The optimization from screening hit to first disclosure of this candidate drug will be presented.","title":"Discovery of the JAK1 selective kinase inhibitor AZD4205.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-979"}
