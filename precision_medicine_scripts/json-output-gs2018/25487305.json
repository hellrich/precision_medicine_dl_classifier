However, few studies have reported the clinical impact of EGFR gene copy number (GCN) and its correlation with EGFR overexpression.\nWe used dual in situ hybridization (DISH) to detect EGFR GCN and chromosome 7 centromere (CEN7) in a set of tissue microarrays representing 855 patients with gastric cancer. These data were compared with those of immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of EGFR expression to evaluate prognostic value.\nEGFR GCN gain (≥ 2.5 EGFR signals per cell) was detected in 194 patients (22.7%) and indicated poor prognosis. Among 194 patients, EGFR amplification (EGFR/CEN7 ≥ 2.0) was observed in 29 patients (14.9%), which was almost identical to the IHC 3+ subgroup and worst prognostic subgroup. Patients with EGFR GCN gain but not amplification, including those exhibiting polysomy, also exhibited poorer prognosis than GCN non-gain patients and were distributed between IHC 0/1+ and 2+ subgroups. GCN gain was frequently observed in patients with more advanced disease, but served as an independent prognostic factor regardless of the pathological stage.\nEGFR GCN gain is a more accurate prognostic biomarker than EGFR overexpression in patients with gastric cancer.","title":"Gene copy number gain of EGFR is a poor prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer: evaluation of 855 patients with bright-field dual in situ hybridization (DISH) method.","pubmedId":"25487305"}
