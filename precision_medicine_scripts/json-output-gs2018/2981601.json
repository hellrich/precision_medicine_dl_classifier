Eleven patients received vaccines produced from the melanoma cell line SK-MEL-13. This cell line, derived from the melanoma of Patient AH, expresses a differentiation antigen (initially defined by autologous antibody) that is restricted to melanomas and other cells of neural crest origin (an example of a Class 2 melanoma antigen). Thirteen patients received vaccines prepared from autologous melanoma cells, the only known source of autologous unique (Class 1) melanoma antigens. VSV lysates were used for vaccination because VSV infection of tumor cells has been shown to augment the immunogenicity of tumor antigens. All patients but one vaccinated with VSV lysates of autologous melanoma cells developed antibodies against VSV, and all patients vaccinated with VSV lysates of SK-MEL-13 developed antibodies against HLA-related antigens. Antibodies against a Class 1 (unique) melanoma antigen were detected in only one case, and antibodies against Class 2 (shared) melanoma antigens were not found in any of the patients. The authors conclude that VSV lysates of melanoma cells are not effective in increasing the serologic response of melanoma patients to Class 1 or 2 melanoma antigens.","title":"Serological response of melanoma patients to vaccines prepared from VSV lysates of autologous and allogeneic cultured melanoma cells.","pubmedId":"2981601"}
