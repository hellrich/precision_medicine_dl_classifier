Comparing benign and malignant tumors, there were significant differences in the median score for all 3 proteins, with decreased p16 (P \u003d .000001), increased cyclin D1 (P \u003d .01), and increased pRb in melanomas (P \u003d .01). There was a progressive loss of expression of p16 with progression from benign naevi to primary melanomas and to metastases. p16 was significantly decreased in primary tumors from melanoma patients who developed recurrent disease (P \u003d .0000013). Cyclin D1 and pRb showed a progressive increase in expression from benign to malignant tumors but with relative decreases in the more advanced tumors (thick primaries and metastatic melanomas). Alterations in cell cycle proteins involved in G1/S transition are implicated in melanocytic tumor progression and have a potential role in diagnosis and prognostication.","title":"Reduced p16 and increased cyclin D1 and pRb expression are correlated with progression in cutaneous melanocytic tumors.","pubmedId":"19666944"}
