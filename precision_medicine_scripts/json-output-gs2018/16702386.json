Thus, PTEN serves as a candidate susceptibility gene for both breast and prostate cancer risk. Whether common inherited variation (either coding or noncoding) at the PTEN locus contribute to nonfamilial, sporadic breast and prostate cancer risk is not known. In this study, we employed a linkage disequilibrium-based approach to test for association between common genetic variation at the PTEN locus and breast and prostate cancer risk in African-American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese, Latina, and White men and women in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. We genotyped 17 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; \u003e/\u003d5% frequency in at least one ethnic group) spanning the PTEN gene to define the common alleles in these populations. These SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium, indicating that our survey captured most of the common sequence variation across this locus. Eight tagging SNPs were selected to predict the common PTEN haplotypes (\u003e/\u003d0.05 frequency) in these populations (two additional tagging SNPs were required for African Americans). These SNPs were evaluated in a breast cancer case-control study (cases, n \u003d 1,615; controls, n \u003d 1,962) and prostate cancer case-control study (cases, n \u003d 2,320; controls, n \u003d 2,290) nested within the Multiethnic Cohort Study. Multiple testing was explicitly accounted for by applying a permutation-based framework. We found no strong association with any common haplotype in relation to breast or prostate cancer risk. In summary, our results show that common variants in PTEN do not substantially influence risk of these two common cancers.","title":"Common genetic variation at PTEN and risk of sporadic breast and prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"16702386"}
