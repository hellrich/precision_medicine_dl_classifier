Using the modified DNA in-gel renaturation assay to detect down to 7-8 copies of amplified DNA sequences, we identified 3 gastric tumors with amplified DNA sequences and confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis that HER-2/neu was amplified greater than 5-fold in these specimens. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue sections with p185 HER-2/neu antibodies demonstrated that only the 3 gastric adenocarcinomas with corresponding HER-2/neu gene amplification displayed membrane immunoreactivity. Amplification of c-met was identified in 2 tumors, and this was the first study to assay for multiple copies of this protooncogene in fresh gastric tumor tissues. Amplification of c-erbB was observed in one tumor, and no evidence for amplification of int-2 was obtained in this series of adenocarcinomas.","title":"Gene amplification in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"2400999"}
