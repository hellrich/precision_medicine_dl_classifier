The control group was the white population of the Detroit area in the same period (1977-1978).\nA total of 25 patients (18 males, 7 females) developed 35 basal cell and/or squamous cell carcinomas: 18 developed basal cell carcinomas, 2 squamous cell carcinomas, and 5 both. The calculated odds ratio was 3.49 (males 3.67, females 2.86, 95% confidence interval 1.52-8.00). No correlations were found with age, type, anatomic site, and length of follow-up of cutaneous melanoma.\nA history of cutaneous melanoma significantly increases the risk of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer.","title":"Risk of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma in persons with prior cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"10848935"}
