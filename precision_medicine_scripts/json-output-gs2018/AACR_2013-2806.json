While the hyaluronan receptor CD44 promotes breast cancer (BC) metastasis, CD146 is a melanoma CAM that appears to suppress BC (although it promotes other cancers). In addition, the molecular mechanism by which CD146 suppresses BC is still unclear. To shed light on this discrepancy, we initially used subtractive hybridization combined with northern blotting, and identified CD146 as a potential downstream target of CD44-signaling in the MDA-435 BC cell line. Here, we provide both structural and functional evidence indicating that CD146 is a downstream target for CD44, in a way that CD146 expression is regulated according to tumor microenvironment. Finally, this study demonstrates a new role for CD44 in regulating neovascularization and promoting cancer cell transmigration of blood vessels via CD146.","title":"CD146, a suppressor of breast cancer, is a novel target of CD44-signaling.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-2806"}
