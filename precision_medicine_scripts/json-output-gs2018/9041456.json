Clinical evidence suggesting that MHC class II expression by melanoma is associated with tumor progression led us to postulate a role for MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation in this disease. First, we investigated whether melanoma cells derived from metastases can process antigen and/or present peptide vi MHC class II molecules to a peptide-specific CD4+ T-cell clone. In all cell lines tested, melanoma cells were able to process antigen and present peptide efficiently to CD4+ T cells, resulting in T-cell proliferation increased 5-26-fold over controls. Next, we found that CD28-mediated costimulation was not required, because blocking with CTLA-4Ig had no effect on the T-cell response to either melanoma or B cells as APCs. In contrast, blocking CD54 (ICAM-1) resulted in a decrease in proliferation in response to peptide presentation by melanoma but not B cells. These data demonstrate that MHC class II molecules on melanoma cells are functional and that antigen-processing pathways are intact. In addition, CD54 seems to play a significant role in peptide presentation by melanoma.","title":"MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation by melanoma cells.","pubmedId":"9041456"}
