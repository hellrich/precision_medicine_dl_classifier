Chromosomal rearrangements resulting in kinase fusions have been described across the NTRK gene family, and may contribute to tumorigenesis in diverse clinical settings. We searched for potentially activating mutations in the NTRK gene family by applying biologically driven ranking criteria to an anonymized next-generation sequencing dataset, sourced from Foundation Medicine (FMI) and Compendia BioSciences (Compendia).  Methods:  Approximately 10,000 patient samples were analyzed for mutations in NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3. Mutation data in other known cancer-related genes were also captured for these tumors. Data were reconciled data across the disparate sources by mapping mutations to the canonical transcript for each gene where possible, or to a representative non-canonical transcript when the mutation occurred in a region not contained within the canonical transcript. Mutations were clustered together based on sequence proximity. Mutation groups were ranked by likelihood of oncogenic-activating potential using six biologically-driven component scores.  Results:  732 distinct mutation clusters were identified across \u003e 20 tumors. NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 represented 33%, 30% and 37%, respectively, of these mutation clusters. A disproportionate number of the most promising mutation clusters were in NTRK3: 59% of the top 5%, 58% of the top 10%, and 46% of the top 25%. In addition, the top 3 mutation clusters were in the NTRK3 kinase domain, and were observed in head and neck, lung, upper gastrointestinal, melanoma and colon cancers.  Conclusions:  This heuristic identified mutations in the NTRK family, especially in NTRK3, that hold promise as oncogenic activating mutations. The highest ranked mutations deserve further study, as they are clonally present in the kinase domain, exist in the absence of other known oncogenic drivers, and are infrequent in germline databases.","title":"Identification of tropomyosin kinase receptor (TRK) mutations in cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150620-156"}
