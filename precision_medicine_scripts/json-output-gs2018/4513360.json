In 9 out of 10 patients with morphological and cytochemical features of acute myeloblastic leukemia the hemoglobin F was greater than 2%. Of the other 25 patients investigated only one patient with polycythemia rubra vera had a hemoglobin F level of more than 2%. Estimation of fetal hemoglobin may be of value in the classification of acute leukemias and the increased level observed probably reflects disturbed hemoglobin synthesis in the acute myeloblastic type.","title":"Hemoglobin abnormalities in neoplastic hematological disorders.","pubmedId":"4513360"}
