We described a male patient with a primary urethral melanoma that arose in a precursor nevus and was treated by excision, bilateral groin dissections and postoperative radiation therapy. Urinary and sexual functions have been maintained. We review the previously reported cases of urethral melanoma in male subjects. The biologic relationship of melanoma to precursor lesions in mucosal sites is discussed.","title":"Melanoma of the male urethra: surgical approach and pathological analysis.","pubmedId":"7109115"}
