C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs with nearly 100% penetrance in patients with MEN 2A syndrome. Our patient did not have CCH or frank MTC, but he expressed the other manifestations of the MEN 2A syndrome.\nMEN 2A syndrome is characterized by the occurrence of MTC, pheochromocytomas, and parathyroid hyperplasia or adenomas. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and more than 80% of patients with MEN 2A have a specific substitution on codon 634 of the RET proto-oncogene. Despite the nearly 100% penetrance of MTC or CCH in patients with MEN 2A, our patient did not have this. Additionally, he exhibited a RET mutation that is uncommonly seen in classic MEN 2A syndrome. Our patient may have a MEN 2A variant or a pseudo-MEN 2A syndrome.","title":"Unusual case of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A syndrome without medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"21134882"}
