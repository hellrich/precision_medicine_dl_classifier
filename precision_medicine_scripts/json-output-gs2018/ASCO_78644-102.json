Anti-tumor activity has been observed in melanoma patients in phase I. This study examines the mode of action of E7080 in preclinical melanoma models  Methods:  Mutational status of 18 genes (9 RTKs, 7 oncogenes and 2 tumor suppressor genes) was determined in 14 human melanoma cell lines.  Gene profile and biomarkers of anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor activity of E7080 were investigated in vitro and in vivo by gene expression analysis in a melanoma cell line panel and in human melanoma tissues.  Results:  18 types of mutation (mu) were found among 9 RTKs in ten of 14 melanoma cell lines. 2 mu of BRAF, 9 mu of TP53, 3 mu of PTEN, 2 mu of CDKN2a and 1 mu of NRAS were also found among 9, 9, 3, 2 and 1 melanoma of 14 cell lines, respectively. 4 of the 5 melanoma with BRAF wild type (wt) were the most sensitive to E7080 in mouse xenograft models, while 5 of the 6 with BRAFmu/PTENwt were the most resistant,  suggesting 3 sub-groups for sensitivity to E7080 based on BRAF/PTEN status: 1; BRAFwt/PTENwt, 2; BRAFmu/PTENmu and 3; BRAFmu/PTENwt. % of pericyte-covered tumor vessels was 25%, 29% and 35% among 3 sub-groups, respectively. Anti-tumor activity of E7080 was correlated to % of pericyte coverage in groups 1 and 2, in which  tumor vessels are sensitive to E7080. DNA microarray analysis demonstrated decreased FGFR1-4 expression in BRAFmu melanoma, while qPCR analysis showed that FGFR2 and FGFR3 expression were significantly higher in BRAFwt than BRAFmu in human melanoma tissues. E7080 inhibited in vitro proliferation of BRAFwt melanoma, which overexpressed FGFR3. Knockdown of FGFR3, FRS-2a, NRAS and AKT-3 genes with siRNA transfection inhibited proliferation of E7080-sensiteve melanoma.  Conclusions:  BRAF/PTEN mutation status was associated with pericyte coverage of tumor vessels and the expression of FGFR1-4 in a panel of melanoma cell lines. E7080 showed superior anti-tumor activity against BRAFwt melanoma, in which the type of tumor vessels was sensitive to angiogenesis inhibition by E7080 and a subgroup of which were dependent on FGFR3 signaling.","title":"The effect of E7080, a VEGFR and FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), on BRAF wild-type melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_78644-102"}
