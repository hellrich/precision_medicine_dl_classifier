The leukemic blasts showed no crossreaction with BL-DR and BL-Ig-L/1. Both the antibodies BL-DR and BL-M/G reacted mainly with the acute myelomonocytic leukemias FAB M4 and only seldom with the acute myelocytic leukemias FAB M1, M2, and M3. The antibodies BL-DR and BL-M/G are able to confirm the diagnosis of acute myelomonocytic leukemia and to classify some previously unclassifiable leukemias.","title":"[Testing of acute myeloid leukemia of humans using monoclonal antibodies BL-DR, BL-M/G, BL-T2 and BL-Ig-L/1].","pubmedId":"3138713"}
