In the melanomas, three categories of TIL were characterised. The first, containing mostly CD3+ and CD8+ cells, lysed only autologous tumour cells; the second, containing mostly CD3+ and CD4+ cells, lysed both autologous tumour cells and allogeneic cells lines; the third, with mixed phenotype although cytotoxic for K562 targets, did not kill melanoma cells. The optimal conditions for a good development of TIL were established: we found that the lymph node or cutaneous origin of the tumour was unimportant, a 2 h enzymatic treatment was optimum and that TIL grew well in AIM V serum free medium. Therefore the easiness and the reproducibility of the TIL cultures from melanoma tumour samples allows the rapid development of therapeutic trials in metastatic melanoma.","title":"Phenotypic and functional analysis of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes from patients with melanoma and other metastatic cancers.","pubmedId":"1591049"}
