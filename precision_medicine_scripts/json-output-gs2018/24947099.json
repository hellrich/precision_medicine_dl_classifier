The distinction of thyroid papillary carcinoma follicular variant and follicular adenoma can be difficult.\nTo investigate the alternative methods like immunohistochemistry and exon 15 in the BRAF gene 1799 T/A mutation analyses for distinguishing thyroid tumors.\nWe applied immunohistochemical markers; CK19, HMWCK, Galectin-3, HBME-1 and Fibronectin and mutant allele-specific PCR amplification technique was used to determine 1799 T/A mutation within the BRAF gene. Formalin-fixed parafin embedded tissues from 45 surgically total resected thyroids, included 26 thyroid papillary carcinoma follicular variant (FV-TPC), 8 Follicular Adenoma (FA), 6 Minimal invasive follicular carcinoma (MIFC) and 5 Follicular Carcinoma (FC). Statistical Analyses Used: Pearson Chi-Square and Kruskal Wallis tests were performed.\nThere was a positive correlation between FV-TPC and HMWCK, CK 19, HBME1, Galectin 3, fibronectin (P \u003c 0.05), but there was no correlation with FV-TPC and BRAF gene mutation (P \u003e 0.05). HBME-1 and CK 19 stained strong and diffuse positive in FV-TPCs but weak and focal in FAs.\nOur study suggests that morphologic features combined with immunohistochemical panel of HMWCK, CK19, HBME-1, Galectin-3 and fibronectin can help to distinguish benign and malign thyroid neoplasms and FV-TPC from follicular adenomas. BRAF gene 1799 T/A mutation has been non-specific but its detection can be a useful tool combined with immunohistochemistry for diagnosing FV-TPC.","title":"Immunohistochemical analysis of thyroid follicular neoplasms and BRAF mutation correlation.","pubmedId":"24947099"}
