MYB gene copy number status was detected by FISH in MYB protein-positive cases.\n82.4% (28/34) of adenoid cystic carcinomas were MYB protein-positive, compared with 9.1% (5/55) of non-adenoid cystic carcinomas, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P \u003c 0.01). 2/18 of adenoid cystic carcinomas had duplication of MYB gene by FISH, and all non-adenoid cystic carcinomas were negative although the difference was not statistically significant (P \u003d 0.435).\nMYB protein expression is a useful diagnostic marker for adenoid cystic carcinomas in its separation from other salivary gland tumors. In addition, duplication of MYB gene is no a major mechanism for the MYB protein overexpression.","title":"[Diagnostic value of MYB protein expression in adenoid cystic carcinoma and status of MYB gene copy number].","pubmedId":"26705183"}
