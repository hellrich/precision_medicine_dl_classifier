We prospectively evaluated minimal residual disease (MRD) by measuring BCR/ ABL levels with a quantitative real-time PCR procedure after induction and after consolidation in 45 adults with Ph+ ALL who obtained complete hematological remission after a high-dose daunorubicin induction schedule. At diagnosis, the mean BCR-ABL/GUS ratio was 1.55 +/- 1.78. A total of 42 patients evaluable for outcome analysis were operationally divided into two MRD groups: good molecular responders (GMRs; n \u003d 28) with \u003e 2 log reduction of residual disease after induction and \u003e 3 log reduction after consolidation therapy, and poor molecular responders (PMRs; n \u003d 14) who, despite complete hematological remission, had a higher MRD at both time points. In GMR, the actuarial probability of relapse-free, disease-free and overall survival at two years was 38, 27 and 48%, respectively, as compared to 0, 0 and 0% in PMR (P \u003d 0.0035, 0.0076 and 0.0026, respectively). Salvage therapy induced a second sustained complete hematological remission in three GMR patients, but in no PMR patient. Our data indicate that, as already shown in children, adult Ph+ ALL patients have a heterogeneous sensitivity to treatment, and that early quantification of residual disease is a prognostic parameter in this disease.","title":"Significant reduction of the hybrid BCR/ABL transcripts after induction and consolidation therapy is a powerful predictor of treatment response in adult Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","pubmedId":"15744351"}
