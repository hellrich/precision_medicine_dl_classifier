Longer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were observed in five patients; 1/3 of M0, 119 of M1, 1/39 of M2, 1/9 of M3 and 1/12 of M5. The sequence analyses of abnormal PCR products showed that all the abnormal products were derived from tandem duplications involving the JM domain and that all the lengthened sequences were in-frame as we previously reported. Statistical analyses revealed a significantly lower incidence of the tandem duplication in childhood AML patients than in adult patients (P \u003c 0.05), and significantly shorter disease-free survival in patients with mutant FLT3 than in patients with wild-type FLT3 (P \u003c 0.05). Our results suggest that the tandem duplication in the JM domain of the FLT3 gene is not a frequent phenomenon but might be a factor of poor prognosis in childhood patients with AML.","title":"Internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene and clinical evaluation in childhood acute myeloid leukemia.
