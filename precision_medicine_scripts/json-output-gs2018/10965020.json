Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in 18 (46%) of 39 informative patients. The regions with high frequency of loss of heterozygosity were the loci at D1S548 (6 / 17; 35.3%) and D1S2843 (7 / 20; 35%), and we found three commonly deleted regions on chromosome 1p35-pter. The frequency of allelic loss in the region of chromosome 1p35-pter was significantly associated with advanced-stage gastric carcinoma, but not with early-stage tumor or with the histology. These results suggest that allelic loss at chromosome 1p35-pter may play a role in the progression of gastric carcinoma.","title":"Allelic loss of the region of chromosome 1p35-pter is associated with progression of human gastric carcinoma.","pubmedId":"10965020"}
