However, the response to BRAF inhibitor therapy is frequently nondurable in patients with advanced melanoma. Novel approaches are thus needed to overcome resistance to these agents and to improve the management of advanced melanoma patients after disease progression. Here, we present the case of a 44-year-old man diagnosed with advanced melanoma in July 2010, harboring a BRAF mutation. Melanoma progressed during first-line chemotherapy with dacarbazine, but showed significant benefit after the initiation of vemurafenib on August 2011. Six months later, the patient experienced disease progression in left-obturator lymphadenopathy; still, anti-BRAF treatment was continued together with stereotactic radiotherapy, and was interrupted only shortly for intestinal occlusion secondary to melanoma metastasis of the bowel. When his conditions were stable, after 1 month of vemurafenib treatment discontinuation, anti-BRAF therapy was reinitiated, with a positive outcome. Vemurafenib treatment was definitively discontinued for disease progression in the brain, peritoneum, lymph node, intestine, and skin in March 2013, after about 20 months from initiation, and the patient died a few weeks later. The clinical case presented here shows that treatment beyond progression with vemurafenib can yield a survival benefit in melanoma patients whose disease progresses in a few sites, which can be treated with locoregional therapies. This clinical strategy needs further validation in prospective clinical trials. ","title":"Vemurafenib beyond progression in a patient with metastatic melanoma: a case report.","pubmedId":"25622086"}
