Recently, we proposed a framework of 7 parameters (PM) describing requirements for a sufficient anti-tumor immune response (the cancer immunogram). In a first analysis we tested pts from our ipi cohort for outcome. Using this framework pts benefitting the most from treatment with ipi might be selected upfront, and in the future also from other checkpoint inhibitors. Methods: Using Kaplan-Meier- and Cox-regression-analysis correlations between 6 of these PM at baseline and overall survival (OS) were investigated in a single center cohort of pts treated with 3 mg/kg ipi for metastatic melanoma. Results of the 7thPM are currently being finalized. Results: PM assessed were: LDH (ULN vs \u003e ULN), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR,ULN vs \u003e ULN), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC, \u003c 1000/mm3 vs 1000/mm3) and IHC on tumor material for CD8+ T-cell infiltration ( \u003c median vs median), PD-L1 expression ( \u003c 1% vs 1% positive cells) and MHC-class I expression (loss vs weak/positive). We analyzed 179 pts treated with ipi between 2010 and 2013. Median age was 55 years (1988) and 61% of pts were male. Minimum follow-up of pts alive was 42 months(mo). Data were available as follows:177 cases LDH, 159 ALC/ESR, 118 PD-L1, 99 CD8 and 68 MHC-class I. Median OS was 7.1 mo. In univariable analysis LDH (HR 2.5, 95%CI 1.8-3.5), ALC (HR 1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.4), ESR (HR 2.4, 95%CI 1.5-3.8) and CD8 (HR 1.8 95%CI 1.2-2.8) were significant for OS (p\u003c 0.01). Pts with all 4 favorable PM had a median OS of 25.1mo(95%NR), pts with 3 PM 15.8 mo(95%CI 7.0-24.7), 2 PM 8.1 mo(95%CI 1.0-15.3), 1 PM 4.8 mo(95%CI 3.3-6.3) and no favorable PM 1.7 mo(95%CI 04.9). In multivariable analysis LDH(HR 2.4,95%CI 1.5-4.0) and CD8(HR 1.7,95%CI 1.1-2.8) were the only independent PM. Pts with a normal LDH and high CD8 had a median OS of 15.8 mo(95%CI 9.5-22.2) vs 3.8 mo(95%CI 1.8-5.7) for pts that did not (p\u003c 0.01). Conclusions: In conclusion, low values of baseline LDH and high values of CD8 are the strongest PM associated with a favorable outcome in pts with advanced melanoma, treated with ipi. The other PM added low effect on the pts outcome upon ipi.","title":"Correlation between baseline parameters and overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab.","pubmedId":"ASCO_192251-199"}
