The results of therapies employing standard chemotherapy are unsatisfactory. Currently, efforts are being made to personalize the therapy; numerous clinical studies are being conducted around the world to assess the efficacy and safety of agents directed at molecular targets. One of these molecular targets is the c-MET proto-oncogene, whose primary ligand is hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). C-MET hyperactivity has been observed in numerous neoplasms, including non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Prolonged or continuous activity of the receptor leads to excessive cell proliferation and is related to the development or progression of neoplastic disease. C-MET inhibitors can be classified into three groups: small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the c-MET receptor (crizotinib, tivantinib, cabozantinib, foretinib), as well as monoclonal antibodies against c-MET (onartuzumab) and against the HGF ligand (ficlatuzumab, rilotumumab). The efficacy and safety of these agents is assessed both in monotherapy and in combination with other molecularly targeted agents. Furthermore, the toxicity profile of c-MET inhibitors is completely different from that of standard chemotherapy. The best understood c-MET inhibitor used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma patients is crizotinib. It is registered for patients with the presence of ALK gene rearrangements after the failure of the first line of treatment based on platinum derivatives. The purpose of this present paper is to present clinical studies that assessed the efficacy and safety of c-MET inhibitors for the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma, as well as current indications for the use of these molecules.","title":"C-MET inhibitors in the treatment of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25266653"}
