MAPK activation has been reported between 0 and 22% in nevi, and 86% of primary melanoma, without any knowledge of BRAF mutational status. We studied the correlation of MAPK activation status, BRAF mutation, and B-Raf expression in CN, AN, and melanoma. Using immunohistochemistry, phosphorylated (active) MAPK and B-Raf expression was studied in 24 CN, 21 AN, and 26 primary cutaneous melanomas (PM). BRAF mutations at codon 600 were assessed by PCR-RFLP. Active MAPK was detected in 29% of CN, 48% of AN, and 85% of PM. BRAF mutation was found in 67% of CN, 62% of AN, and 58% of PM. In all, 23% of CN, 54% of AN, and 93% of PM with BRAF mutation have activated MAPK. All lesions expressed B-Raf. BRAF mutation does not seem to be sufficient to produce MAPK activation in melanocytic nevi, and it is suggested that other events are needed to induce MAPK activation, that is, B-Raf overexpression, inhibition of MAPK phosphatases, or suppression of RAF kinase inhibitors.","title":"Lack of association between BRAF mutation and MAPK ERK activation in melanocytic nevi.","pubmedId":"16417232"}
