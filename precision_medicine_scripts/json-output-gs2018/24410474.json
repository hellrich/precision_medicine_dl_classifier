EGF receptor (EGFR) plays important roles in gastric carcinogenesis by regulation of cell cycle, angiogenesis and apoptosis. This review evaluates the functions, mechanisms and clinical uses of EGFR in gastric cancer. Although EGFR targeted single therapy shows limited effect, the combination of EGFR targeted agents with traditional chemotherapy regimens may bring about important progress in cancer therapy. More clinical trials should be performed to clarify both the prognostic and therapeutic value of EGFR in gastric cancer.
