In both univariate and multivariate analyses, BRAF mutations showed a strong association with PTC variants (classical and tall cell), tumor size (11-20 mm), multifocality, absence of tumor capsule, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, higher American Joint Commission on Cancer stage, and younger patient age. In PTCs staged as pT1 with thyroid capsule invasion, the frequency of BRAF mutations was significantly higher than in pT1 tumors that did not invade the thyroid capsule (67.3 vs. 31.8%, respectively; P \u003c 0.0001). No statistically significant difference in BRAF alterations was found between pT1 tumors with thyroid capsule invasion and pT3 tumors (67.3 and 67.5%, respectively).\nWe suggest that evaluation of BRAF status would be useful even in pT1 tumors to improve risk stratification and patient management, although follow-up data are necessary to confirm our speculations.","title":"Correlation between the BRAF V600E mutation and tumor invasiveness in papillary thyroid carcinomas smaller than 20 millimeters: analysis of 1060 cases.","pubmedId":"20631031"}
