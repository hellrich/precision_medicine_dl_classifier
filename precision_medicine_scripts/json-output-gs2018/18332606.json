A multiple IIc-like depressed lesion originating in the stomach soon became elevated as the liver lesion progressed. HE staining produced hepatoma-like histological findings for the tumors of the lung, liver and stomach, while immunohistochemical staining showed them to be positive for PIVKA-II and weakly positive for HP-1. Autopsy led to a diagnosis of a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma producing bile juice with metastasis to the lung and stomach. It is not clear why advanced metastasis in the lung occurred while the hepatocellular carcinoma in the liver was still small, but one possible explanation lies in the localization of the hepatic cancer: the tumor was located near a branch of the hepatic vein and vascular invasion may have caused early pulmonary metastasis via the hepatic venous flow.","title":"[Case of moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with gastric metastasis].","pubmedId":"18332606"}
