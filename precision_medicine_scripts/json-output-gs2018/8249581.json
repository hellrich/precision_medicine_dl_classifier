Simultaneously, an excision was performed of a cutaneous melanoma together with a satellite nodule presumed to be a metastasis from the cutaneous, superficial spreading melanoma. Six months later, chemotherapy for liver metastasis was given without effect. There were no signs of dysplastic nevus syndrome. A 39-year-old cousin, however, had been enucleated for a malignant choroidal melanoma. This sporadic case might suggest a common etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of multicentric melanomas.","title":"Simultaneous occurrence of primary choroidal and cutaneous malignant melanoma and skin metastasis.","pubmedId":"8249581"}
