This procedure is adaptable to preparing a number of 5\u0027-fluoro-5\u0027-deoxycarbocyclic nucleoside analogs with diversity in the heterocyclic base. Antiviral analysis found promising activity for 2 toward measles but no other viruses. No cytotoxicity was observed for 2.","title":"5\u0027-Fluoro-5\u0027-deoxyaristeromycin.","pubmedId":"18023578"}
