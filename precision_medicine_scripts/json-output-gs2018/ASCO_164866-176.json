They are highly invasive and the cellular and genetic inter- and intratumor heterogeneity contributes to treatment resistance. The interactions and intercellular communications between malignant and non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment are deemed tumor-promoting and critically to improve the understanding of the disease. N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is a stress inducible gene and key determinant of resistance towards alkylating chemotherapy in glioblastoma. Methods: To analyze the NDRG1 effects on the brain tumor microenvironment, we used a human NDRG1 knockdown (KD) glioma model system. In orthotopic xenograft experiments control and KD microenvironments were compared for angiogenesis and infiltrating immune cells dependent on NDRG1. Clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages. In vitro and in vivo angiogenesis assays were used to assess neovascularization. Results: Orthotopic tumors showed significant volume differences between control and NDRG1 KD implanted cells and demonstrated a markedly increased vessel density in the NDRG1 KD microenvironment. Ex vivo flow cytometry analyses of the tumor stromal cells revealed a significant increase in peripheral macrophages in NDRG1 KD microenvironment compared to the control microenvironment. The same was shown for dendritic cells as well as for monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Depletion of macrophages however did not alter tumor growth of NDRG1 KD tumors. Cytokine array analysis on U87MG NDRG1 KD and control supernatants showed a marked increase in CCL2 secretion in the NDRG1 KD cells. Macrophages showed an increased migration rate towards NDRG1 knockdown environment in vitro. Conclusions: Glioma NDRG1 shapes the tumor microenvironment by regulating angiogenesis and influences macrophage recruitment in vivo and in vitro. CCL2 was identified as a relevant cytokine dependent of the NDRG1 status in this human glioma model. These data could help to better understand the relationship between NDRG1 and the tumor microenvironment.","title":"Effect of Glioma N-Myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) on the tumor microenvironment.","pubmedId":"ASCO_164866-176"}
