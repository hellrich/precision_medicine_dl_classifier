Variables affecting HSCT outcome were analysed in 81 children from the ANZCHOG ALL8 trial. The major cause of treatment failure was relapse, with a cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years (CIR) of 32% and treatment-related mortality of 8%. Leukaemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were similar for HSCT in CR1 (LFS 62%, OS 83%, n \u003d 41) or CR2/CR3 (LFS 60%, OS 72%, n \u003d 40). Patients achieving bone marrow MRD negativity pre-HSCT had better outcomes (LFS 83%, OS 92%) than those with persistent MRD pre-HSCT (LFS 41%, OS 64%, P \u003c 0·0001) or post-HSCT (LFS 35%, OS 55%, P \u003c 0·0001). Patients with B-other ALL had more relapses (CIR 50%, LFS 41%) than T-ALL and the main precursor-B subtypes including BCR-ABL1, KMT2A (MLL), ETV6-RUNX1 (TEL-AML1) and hyperdiploidy \u003e50. A Cox multivariate regression model for LFS retained both B-other ALL subtype (hazard ratio 4·1, P \u003d 0·0062) and MRD persistence post-HSCT (hazard ratio 3·9, P \u003d 0·0070) as independent adverse prognostic variables. Persistent MRD could be used to direct post-HSCT therapy.
