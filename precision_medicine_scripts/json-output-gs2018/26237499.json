Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard therapy for non-oncodrivers population. Sorafenib is a small molecule that blocks the activation of C-RAF, B-RAF, c-KIT, FLT-3, RET, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3 and PDGFR approved for advanced renal cell and hepatocellular carcinoma (b, c). Many studies have evaluated sorafenib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with different results. We present a case report of a patient with NSCLC and the BRAF G469R mutation who showed a dramatic response to sorafenib.
