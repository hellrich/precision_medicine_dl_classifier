The invasion of these tumors and its giant cells by histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and especially by eosinophilic granulocytes is viewed as an immune response, which may explain a favorable clinical course. Fifty-three percent of the patients were younger than 45 years at the time of surgery. The average postoperative survival of 27.4 months was clearly longer than in glioblastoma. These biological features suggest a differentiation from glioblastoma multiforme. The classification of this entity as \"monstrocellular astrocytoma\" is proposed.","title":"Contribution to the problem of giant cell astrocytomas.","pubmedId":"2458550"}
