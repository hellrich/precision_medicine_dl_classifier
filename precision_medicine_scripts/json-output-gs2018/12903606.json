Hyperthermic antiblastic perfusion (HAP) permits the isolation of involved extremity from the systemic circulation and to deliver high doses of antineoplastic drugs. The association of cytostatic drugs to hyperthermia (\u003e or \u003d 41.5 degrees C) results in a synergistic effect with an increased therapeutic effectiveness. The overall 5 and 10-year survival rates in relation to the disease stages are st. II 75% and 67%; st. IIIA 59% and 42%; st. IIIAB 36% and 30% respectively. The results confirm that HAP is considered the treatment of choice of loco-regional spreading limb melanoma. Recently, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been combined with Melphalan and hyperthermia. This trimodality association seems to be superior to Melphalan and hyperthermia alone only in patient with bulky tumors (i.e., multiple nodules), as a matter of fact the complete tumor response rates observed in these patients have been 67% and 20% respectively. The greater effectiveness of trimodality association has to be confirmed by multicentric randomized trials.","title":"[Anti-blastic hyperthermic perfusion in the treatment of melanoma of the extremities in the loco-regional diffusion phase].","pubmedId":"12903606"}
