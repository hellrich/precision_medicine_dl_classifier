EGFR, ErbB3, and ErbB4 are promising targets of malignant melanoma for new molecular drug development. However, the biology of ErbB family signaling pathways indicates that functional redundancy and heterodimerization among ErbB family members can greatly compromise the therapeutic efficacy of single ErbB targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In fact, Phase II clinical trials have already shown that EGFR (ErbB1) targeting TKIs provide limited benefits to melanoma patients. Here, this study has compared single vs. multiple ErbB targeting TKIs for inhibiting the growth of melanoma cells with different ErbB family protein expression profiles. We examined the expression of ErbB family members in 14 different human melanoma cell lines (MEL-526, M14, UPCI-MEL 527.1 and 11 SK-MEL cells). EGFR was expressed in 5 of the cell lines examined (35.7 %). ErbB2 was present in 13 lines (92.9 %); ErbB3 was found in 12 lines (85.7 %); and ErbB4 was found in all the cell lines. Furthermore, individual cell lines had a particular dominant form of ErbB protein. This differential expression pattern of ErbB family proteins was also seen in melanoma tissues from patients. Out of 14 melanoma cases examined by immunohistochemistry, 8 samples (61.5 %) were positive for ErbB1 and ErbB4 expression while ErbB2 was detected in 11 samples (84.6 %). We also found that Neuregulin 3 (which ranged from 500 to 76500 pg/ml) and Neuregulin 4 (which ranged from 26-300 pg/ml), which activate ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, are the major ErbB ligands released by the human melanoma cell lines. TGF and Amphiregulin, which mainly bind to EGFR, were released in relatively lower levels by the majority of the cell lines, but high levels of these ligands were distinctly found in individual cell lines. Among all the cell lines examined, HB-EGF was barely undetectable. In addition, different sensitivities towards single ErbB targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and pan-ErbB targeting TKIs were seen among the melanoma cells. For example, the TKI sensitivities of MEL526 which expressed no EGFR but high ErbB2, 3, and 4 proteins, was found to be: lapatinib (IC50: 6.7 M) \u003e canertinib (IC50: 12.4 M) \u003d erlotinib (IC50: 12.9 M) \u003e gefitinib (IC50: 23 M). Similarly, M14 and UPCI-MEL527.1, which also have no EGFR expression but express ErbB 2, 3, 4, also responded better to lapatinib and canertinib respectively than to gefitinib or erlotinib. Our study is the first to suggest that the pan-ErbB targeting approach may be more effective in treatment malignant melanoma. Our findings also suggest that future screening of melanoma patients for their dominantly expressed ErbB protein types can potentially serve as a guide for the choice of effective ErbB TKI in treating malignant melanoma.","title":"Biological basis of pan-ErbB receptor targeting for malignant melanoma treatment","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-3864"}
