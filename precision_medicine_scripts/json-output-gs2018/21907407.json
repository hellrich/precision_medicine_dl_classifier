The overall hazard ratio (HR) of FLT3-TKD/FLT3-wild type (WT) for disease-free survival (DFS) was 1.20. The overall HRs for overall survival (OS) of FLT3-TKD to FLT3-ITD and FLT3-WT were 0.87 and 1.18. For non-promyelocytic AML with intermediate cytogenetics, the overall HR for DFS of FLT3-TKD/FLT3-ITD was 0.71. The HR for OS of FLT3-TKD/FLT3-ITD was 0.75. Adult AML patients with FLT3-TKD mutations exhibit better outcomes than those with FLT3-ITD. The patients with FLT3-TKD mutations with intermediate cytogenetics had similar OS as those with FLT-WT mutations.","title":"Meta-analysis for the potential application of FLT3-TKD mutations as prognostic indicator in non-promyelocytic AML.","pubmedId":"21907407"}
