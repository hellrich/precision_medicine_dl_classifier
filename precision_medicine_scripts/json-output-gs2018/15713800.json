We recently identified NUP214-ABL1 as a variant ABL1 fusion gene in 6% of T-ALL patients. Here we describe the identification of another ABL1 fusion, EML1-ABL1, in a T-ALL patient with a cryptic t(9;14)(q34;q32) associated with deletion of CDKN2A (p16) and expression of TLX1 (HOX11). Echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 1-Abelson 1 (EML1-ABL1) is a constitutively phosphorylated tyrosine kinase that transforms Ba/F3 cells to growth factor-independent growth through activation of survival and proliferation pathways, including extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (Stat5), and Lyn kinase. Deletion of the coiled-coil domain of EML1 abrogated the transforming properties of the fusion kinase. EML1-ABL1 and breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-ABL1 were equally sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. These data further demonstrate the involvement of ABL1 fusions in the pathogenesis of T-ALL and identify EML1-ABL1 as a novel therapeutic target of imatinib.","title":"Fusion of EML1 to ABL1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with cryptic t(9;14)(q34;q32).","pubmedId":"15713800"}
