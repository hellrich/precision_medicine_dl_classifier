Transcript levels were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and were correlated with clinicopathological data collected over 10 years.\nHigher p14 mRNA transcript levels were associated with non-cancerous background tissue specimens (median copy numbers: 103 vs. 4, p\u003d0.0095), with better overall and disease-free survival, and in TNM2 stage tumours (TNM2 vs. TNM1, 27.2 vs. 3.5, p\u003d0.049; TNM1/TNM2 vs. TNM3/4, 26 vs. 2, p\u003d0.009). There was no significant relationship between p16 levels and clinicopathological parameters. A correlation between p14 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) levels was observed (r\u003d0.406, p\u003d0.00005).\np14 expression seems to increase initially in early breast cancer and decrease with further tumour progression. p14 may be induced to counteract immortalisation and hTERT surge.","title":"P14ARF is down-regulated during tumour progression and predicts the clinical outcome in human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"23645774"}
