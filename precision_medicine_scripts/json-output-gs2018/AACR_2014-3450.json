RET is also a potent contributor to clinically challenging cancers. Activating mutations in RET can lead to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, a cancer syndrome characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma. Increased activation of wildtype RET receptors has been linked to aggressive breast cancers, and enhanced invasion and perineural spread in pancreatic carcinoma. Two distinct isoforms of the growth factor receptor arise through alternative splicing of the 3 exons, and are termed RET9 and RET51 to denote the number of amino acids in each C-terminal tail. These isoforms induce unique transphosphorylation patterns on intracellular tyrosine residues, differentially bind downstream signalling proteins, and possess different intrinsic abilities to cause cellular transformation. Here, we explore the differential subcellular localization and trafficking of the two isoforms in human cell line models to better understand RET-mediated cancers. We have observed that RET51 is efficiently matured and localized to the cell membrane, while immature RET9 matures more slowly, leading to lower relative expression on the plasma membrane. Subsequent to RET activation, both isoforms at the cell surface are internalized through AP2-adaptor interactions and the clathrin coated-pit pathway into endosomes. Although RET51 is internalized more rapidly than RET9, a portion of RET51 molecules recycles back to the plasma membrane, maintaining high expression levels at the cell surface. We have shown that RET51 interacts with the sorting protein GGA3, which may allow the long isoform to travel back to the cell surface. Recycling prevents efficient degradation of RET51, allowing for prolonged downstream signaling relative to RET9. Since RET51 has a longer residency time in an endosomal compartment, where sustained Erk1/2 signaling promotes mitogenesis, this may in part explain the greater transforming potential of RET51. Together, our data suggest that differences in RET isoform subcellular localization and trafficking would lead to differences in signal transduction and may in part explain the functional differences observed between RET isoforms.","title":"Internalization and recycling of RET receptor tyrosine kinase isoforms","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3450"}
