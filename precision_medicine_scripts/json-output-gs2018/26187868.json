Core biopsies of a retroperitoneal mass demonstrated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) with unusual Paired box 5 (PAX5) positivity. The same malignant cells were identifiable on urine cytology. Staging investigations revealed extensive nodal and extranodal disease including ALK negative ALCL involving the kidney and prostate, which has not previously been reported in the published literature.
