Mutations in the Rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene are considered the causative event of MTC. The objective of this study was to examine whether small interfering RNA (siRNA) and its combined treatment with CPT-11 could inhibit MTC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. The transfection of RET siRNA suppressed RET expression, reduced proliferation, and increased caspase-3/7 activity via the down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression. Combined treatments with CPT-11 or SN-38 significantly increased caspase 3/7 activity compared with RET siRNA, CPT-11 or SN-38 treatment alone. Importantly, intratumoral injection of RET siRNA along with intravenous injection of CPT-11 significantly inhibited the tumor growth of MTC xenografts via an increased apoptotic effect. These findings that RET siRNA enhanced sensitivity for CPT-11 will provide a novel strategy for the treatment of MTC with RET mutation.","title":"Combination of RET siRNA and irinotecan inhibited the growth of medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells and xenografts via apoptosis.","pubmedId":"20704575"}
