Blood samples from 67 MTC patients (22 hereditary and 45 sporadic), 3 asymptomatic mutant RET gene carriers and 178 ethnically matched healthy control individuals were tested. Screening of RET exons and portion of introns 1, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 and GFRA1 5\u0027-UTR was performed by means of direct sequencing and PCR-RFLP. 8 polymorphic variants of RET gene (exons 11, 13, 14, 15 and introns 1, 8, 13, 14) and 4 GFRA1 polymorphisms in GFRA1 were detected. Linkage disequilibrium was found between RET variants G691S and S904S, L769L and IVS8, S836S and IVS13. In sporadic MTCs, allelic frequency of only one polymorphic RET variant, L769L, was significantly decreased versus control group. In hereditary MTCs, a significant over-representation of S836S and under-representation of S904S sequence variants were observed as compared to sporadic MTCs and controls. No co-segregation was found between individual polymorphisms and phenotype of sporadic MTC. In patients with inherited MTC whose genotype was presented with polymorphic L769L and wild-type S836S, disease onset occurred 20 years later than in individuals with polymorphic L769L and S836S or wild-type L769L (p \u003d 0.01) suggestive of a possible protective role of L769L in MTC development and modulating effect of a combination of L769L with wild-type S836S on clinical outcome of inherited MTC.","title":"[RET and GFRA1 germline polymorphisms in medullary thyroid cancer patients].","pubmedId":"16813162"}
