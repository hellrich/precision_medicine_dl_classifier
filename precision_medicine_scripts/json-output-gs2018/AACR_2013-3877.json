Identification of metastasis inducing genes may offer valuable mechanistic insight for guiding specific therapeutic strategies. We report here that the carboxypeptidase E gene (CPE) is alternatively spliced in human tumors to yield an N-terminal truncated protein (CPE-DELTA-N) that drives metastasis. CPE-DELTA-N mRNA was elevated in human metastatic colon, breast and HCC cell lines. Suppression of CPE-DELTA-N expression in these cell lines by si-RNA significantly inhibited their growth migration and invasion. To confirm these observations in vivo, an orthotopic nude mouse model was established. The mice implanted with a tumor derived from HCC cells transfected with si- CPE-DELTA-N RNA in the liver did not show tumor growth or metastasis, compared to scrambled controls. In HCC cytosolic CPE-DELTA-N protein was translocated to the nucleus and upregulated the expression of neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated gene 9 (Nedd9), through interaction with histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1/2. Inhibition of HDAC activity by the HDAC inhibitors suppressed expression of NEDD9, without effecting CPE-DELTA-N expression. The enhanced invasive phenotype of HCC cells stably transfected with CPE-DELTA-N was suppressed when Nedd9 was silenced by si-RNA. cDNA Microarray studies of HCC cells overexpressing CPE-DELTA-N showed elevated expression of 27 genes associated with metastasis such as Nedd9, claudin 2 (cldn2), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (ceacam5) and carbonyl reductase 1(cbr1), while 30 genes associated with tumor suppressor function, which included insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 and 3 (igfbp5 and igfbp3) and h19 were down-regulated. These data were further confirmed by qRTPCR. Suppression of CPE-DELTA-N expression in HT1080 cell line by si-RNA significantly down regulated ceacam5 and cbr1. In clinical studies, CPE-DELTA-N mRNA quantification in 99 patients with primary tumor (T) and normal surrounding tissue (N) established a T/N cut off value which predicted future intra-hepatic metastasis with high sensitivity and specificity, independent of cancer stage. Additionally, prospective study on 16 resected PHEO/PGLs having very high CPE-DELTA-N mRNA copy numbers accurately predicted future metastasis or recurrence in patients diagnosed with benign tumors at time of surgery, versus low copy numbers in post-surgery, disease-free patients. Additionally, CPE-DELTA-N is a diagnostic biomarker for metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma and colorectal cancer. Thus CPE-DELTA-N induces tumor metastasis and is a powerful biomarker for predicting future metastasis and recurrence in HCC and PHEO/PGL patients, superior to histopathological diagnosis.","title":"An N-terminal truncated carboxypeptidase E splice isoform induces metastasis by activating nedd9, ceacam5, cbr1 and other metastasis inducing genes.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-3877"}
