The gene responsible for NBCCS is PTCH1. The development of meningioma in NBCCS patients is a rare event. Here, we report two cases of NBCCS in which meningiomas did develop. The first patient carried a germline mutation in one allele of PTCH1, c.290dupA (p.N97KfsX43). In addition, the meningioma sample carried a somatic mutation, c.307delG (p.Val103LeufsX15), in the other allele of the same gene, suggesting a second hit. This is the first case of NBCCS-associated meningioma explained by the standard two-hit hypothesis. The second patient had a germline nonsense mutation in the SUFU gene, c.550C\u003eT (p.Q184X). SUFU is located downstream of PTCH1 in the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. This is the second time a germline mutation in SUFU has been found to cause NBCCS. Together with the previous report describing three cases of non-NBCCS medulloblastoma carrying a germline mutation in this gene, individuals with a SUFU germline mutation are expected to have a markedly high risk of developing medulloblastoma and probably meningioma.","title":"Two cases of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome associated with meningioma caused by a PTCH1 or SUFU germline mutation.","pubmedId":"22829011"}
