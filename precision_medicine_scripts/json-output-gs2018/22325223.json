The proportion of follicular thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma was decreasing accordingly; however, the proportion of medullary thyroid carcinoma did not change significantly.\nThe pathological classification of the thyroid carcinoma patients has significant changes in the 4342 cases treated in our Hospital from 1954 to 2009. The proportion of papillary carcinoma is increased, while that of follicular carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma is decreased. The reasons might attribute to the improved level of consultations and iodized diet or other factors.","title":"[Analysis of variation trends of thyroid cancer treated in Tianjin Cancer Hospital form 1954 to 2009].","pubmedId":"22325223"}
