{"publicationTypes":["2012 AACR Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"The differential diagnosis between squamous cell carcinomas of the head \u0026 neck and squamous cell carcinomas of the lung is often unresolved because the histologic appearance of these two tumor types is quite similar. We have developed and validated a gene expression profile test (Pathwork Tissue of Origin Head \u0026 Neck Test) that distinguishes head \u0026 neck squamous and lung squamous cancers in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens using a 2160-gene classification model. The test was validated in a blinded study using a pre-specified algorithm and microarray data files for 76 metastatic, poorly differentiated or undifferentiated FFPE tumor specimens that had either a known head \u0026 neck squamous or lung squamous diagnosis. The study met the primary Bayesian statistical endpoint for acceptance. Measures of test performance include overall agreement with the known diagnosis of 82.9% (95% CI, 72.5% to 90.6%), an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.91 and a diagnostics odds ratio (DOR) of 23.6. Head \u0026 neck squamous cancers (N\u003d38) gave an agreement with the known diagnosis of 81.6% and lung squamous cancers (N\u003d38) gave an agreement of 84.2%. Reproducibility in test results between three laboratories had a concordance of 91.7%. The Tissue of Origin Head \u0026 Neck Test can aid in resolving the important differential diagnostic question for head \u0026 neck and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.","title":"A gene expression profile test to resolve squamous cell carcinomas of head \u0026 neck from squamous cell carcinomas of the lung","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1724"}
