Here we investigate the impact of somatic mutations and their clearance on disease response and patient outcomes. Methods: 88 samples from 41 study pts were sequenced. All 41 pts were analyzed pre-treatment, and a median of 3 longitudinal samples were analyzed from 19 pts between Cycle 2 and 9. Mutations were assayed by SureSelect targeted capture exon sequencing (Agilent) of 295 genes that are recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies. Longitudinal mutation clearance was analyzed by plotting variant allele frequency (VAF). Results: At baseline, 96 mutations in 28 genes were detected in 38 pts, with the most frequent being in SRSF2 (27%), DNMT3A (20%), IDH2 (17%), RUNX1 (17%), and TET2(17%). Mutations associated with CR rate and OS are indicated in the Table. A CR was achieved in 10/19 pts that had longitudinal sequencing analysis and at the time of CR, 9 (90%) had persistently detectable mutations in their bone marrow. In 7 of them, continued exposure to pracinostat + AZA lowered the VAF or cleared residual mutations. In 2 pts, relapsed samples showed re-expansion of the founder clone. Conclusions: Mutations in NPM1, and DNA methylation pathway were associated with a better response to pracinostat + AZA, while TP53 mutation was associated with a poor response. Persistent mutation at the time of CR suggests residual preleukemic clonal hematopoiesis in this elderly population. Benefit of prolonged exposure to pracinostat + AZA was also confirmed at molecular level where continued decline of mutation VAF was seen after achieving CR.
