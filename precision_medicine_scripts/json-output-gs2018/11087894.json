In this study, we investigated in a PCR-sequencing analysis the exon 11 of the human MDM2 gene for gene alterations. A MboII polymorphism occurs in 8% of normal blood donors (8 out of 100 probands) and in 13% of the soft tissue sarcoma patients (11 out of 82 patients). Of note was that two STS patients carried the gene alteration only in the tumor specimens heterozygously but not in normal tissue. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients without the polymorphism, indicated a median survival rate of 57 months, whereas, patients with the polymorphism survived on average only 38 months. We suggest that this polymorphism might be associated with an increased cancer susceptibility.","title":"A MboII polymorphism in exon 11 of the human MDM2 gene occuring in normal blood donors and in soft tissue sarcoma patients: an indication for an increased cancer susceptibility?","pubmedId":"11087894"}
