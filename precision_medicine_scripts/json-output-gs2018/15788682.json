TPR-MET, a constitutively active oncogenic variant of MET, serves as excellent model for testing c-MET inhibitors. Here, we characterized a small molecule c-MET inhibitor, PHA665752, and tested its cooperation with the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor as potential targeted therapy.\nThe effect of PHA665752 treatment was determined on cell growth, motility and migration, apoptosis, and cell-cycle arrest of TPR-MET-transformed cells. Moreover, the effect of PHA665752 on the phosphorylation on MET, as well as its downstream effectors, p-AKT and p-S6K, was also determined. Finally, growth of TPR-MET-transformed cells was tested in the presence of PHA665752 and rapamycin. H441 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (with activated c-Met) were also tested against both PHA665752 and rapamycin.\nPHA665752 specifically inhibited cell growth in BaF3. TPR-MET cells (IC(50) \u003c 0.06 micromol/L), induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Constitutive cell motility and migration of the BaF3. TPR-MET cells was also inhibited. PHA665752 inhibited specific phosphorylation of TPR-MET as well as phosphorylation of downstream targets of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. When combined with PHA665752, rapamycin showed cooperative inhibition to reduce growth of BaF3. TPR-MET- and c-MET-expressing H441 NSCLC cells.\nPHA665752 is a potent small molecule-selective c-MET inhibitor and is highly active against TPR-MET-transformed cells both biologically and biochemically. PHA665752 is also active against H441 NSCLC cells. The c-MET inhibitor can cooperate with rapamycin in therapeutic inhibition of NSCLC, and in vivo studies of this combination against c-MET expressing cancers would be merited.","title":"A selective small molecule c-MET Inhibitor, PHA665752, cooperates with rapamycin.","pubmedId":"15788682"}
