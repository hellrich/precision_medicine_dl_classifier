A total of 80 patients with a primary parosteal osteosarcoma were included in this retrospective study. There were 51 females and 29 males with a mean age of 29.9 years (11 to 78). The mean follow-up was 11.2 years (1 to 40). Overall survival was 91.8% at five years and 87.8% at ten years. Local recurrence occurred in 14 (17.5%) patients and was associated with intralesional surgery and a large volume of tumour. On histological examination, 80% of the local recurrences were dedifferentiated high-grade tumours. A total of 12 (14.8%) patients developed pulmonary metastases, of whom half had either a dedifferentiated tumour or a local recurrence. Female gender and young age were good prognostic factors. Local recurrence was a poor prognostic factor for survival. Medullary involvement or the use of chemotherapy had no impact on survival. The main goal in treating a parosteal osteosarcoma must be to achieve a wide surgical margin, as inadequate margins are associated with local recurrence. Local recurrence has a significant negative effect on survival, as 80% of the local recurrences are high-grade dedifferentiated tumours, and half of these patients develop metastases. The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of parosteal osteosarcoma is not as obvious as it is in the treatment of conventional osteosarcoma. The mainstay of treatment is wide local excision.","title":"The prognostic and therapeutic factors which influence the oncological outcome of parosteal osteosarcoma.","pubmedId":"26637687"}
