Alteration in TGF-β pathway has been reported in many cancers. So In search for new molecular targets we analyzed the role of SMAD4, critical TGF-β pathway mediator, in Saudi colorectal cancersMethods: 426 CRC cases were analyzed for SMAD4 mutations by targeted capture sequencing and protein expression status by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format. Results were analyzed for association with any clinico-pathological parameters and for prognostic significance.Results: SMAD4 mutations were detected in 11.9 %( 50/418) cases of Saudi colorectal cancers. CRC with SMAD4 mutations were significantly associated with NRAS mutations (p\u003d0.0481). SMAD4 complete loss of expression by immunohistochemistry was seen in 12.8% (52/404) cases and this loss was associated with young age (p\u003d0.0236) and inversely with MSI-high tumors (p\u003d0.0005). SMAD4 expression loss by immunohistochemistry and mutation were significantly associated with each other(p\u003d0.0028). In the multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model SMAD4 expression loss was an independent marker of poor prognosis (p\u003d0.0119)Conclusion: SMAD4 alteration was found to be associated with a poor overall survival in the Saudi colorectal cancer patients. With the advent of targeted anticancer therapy, this study confirms the findings of other investigators and highlights a potential target which can be exploited to improve the survival of CRC patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","title":"SMAD4 loss is associated with poor prognosis in Middle Eastern colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-2255"}
