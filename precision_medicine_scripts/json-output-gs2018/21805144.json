Extraosseous ES/PNETs are uncommon, with occasional reports of tumors affecting the genitourinary tract. Only few cases of primary vulvar Ewing\u0027s sarcoma/PNET have previously been reported.\nWe present a patient with primary vulvar Ewing\u0027s sarcoma with pulmonary metastasis who presented at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck.\nThe present report is the third case of a primary vulvar Ewing\u0027s sarcoma and the first constellation with pulmonary metastasis at diagnosis in the current literature. We present the diagnostic and therapeutic management including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.\nThe treatment of the Ewing\u0027s sarcomas and PNETs requires a multidisciplinary systemic approach. Despite its rarity, the differential diagnosis of vulvar sarcoma must be considered in young women.","title":"Primary metastasized extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma of the vulva: report of a case and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"21805144"}
