ERBB signal pathway plays a very important role in the initiation and progression of gastric cancer, however the ERBB2 expression and mutation rate is relative low especially in gastric SRCC. Thus, ERBB3 might be a promising target for the treatment in SRCC patients. The aim of this study is to speculate the prognostic and targeted therapy value in gastric SRCC by evaluating the mutation rate and type of ERBB3. Methods: 92 patients with histological diagnosis of advanced gastric SRCC were retrospectively selected. ERBB3 mutation was evaluated by next generation sequencing from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. ERBB2 expression was tested by immunohistochemistry. Correlations between ERBB2/3 status and clinical pathologic characteristics and overall survival (OS) were performed. Results: All of the 92 patients were diagnosed as local advanced or metastatic gastric SRCC (92.4% were stage III, 7.6% were stage IV). All the patients received 5-FU-based first-line chemotherapy. 14 out of all 92 patients were ERBB3 mutated SRCC, in which only 2 samples were ERBB2 positive. 12 of all the 14 mutations were in the extracellular domain, 2 were in the transmembrane region. There was no correlation between ERBB3 mutation and serosa invasion (P \u003d 0.389) or lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 1.000). The median OS was 20.5 months (95% CI \u003d 10.05to 30.95 months) for patients with ERBB3 mutation, and 19.0 months (95% CI \u003d 15.54 to 22.46 months) for patients without ERBB3 mutation (P \u003d 0.567). There was no difference in OS according to HER2 positive or negative in ERBB3 mutated patients (14.8 months vs 20.5 month, P \u003d 0.374). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated 15.2% of gastric SRCC patients harboring ERBB3 mutation, providing a potential subgroup of gastric SRCC for targeted treatment on ERBB pathway. No difference of OS was observed, probably due to the relative small sample size and low ERBB2 positive rate in SRCC patients. Further investigation on ERBB3 is warranted to clarify mechanisms of ERBB pathway in gastric SRCC.","title":"ERBB pathway alterations in advanced gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) and the implications for targeted therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_182223-199"}
