Primary brain tumors rarely metastasize outside of the central nervous system (CNS) without prior neurosurgery. Extracranial spread at diagnosis has been previously documented in just two adults. Extracranial metastasis of a childhood glioma without prior neurosurgery at any time during the course of the disease is exceedingly rare. Spread to bone by gliomas is also infrequent, and when they occur, bony metastases are usually isolated to one or two sites in any given patient. The widespread osseous metastases in our patient have been reported in three prior cases of high-grade gliomas. This child\u0027s GBM likely reflects a highly aggressive variant with the potential to spread outside the CNS and with a predilection for bone. Oncologists should be aware that GBM may present in this fashion during childhood.","title":"Diffuse bony metastases at presentation in a child with glioblastoma multiforme.
