However, resistance develops rapidly following BRAF inhibitor treatment. We have found that BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines are more sensitive than wild-type BRAF cells to the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor dovitinib. Sensitivity is associated with inhibition of a series of known dovitinib targets. Dovitinib in combination with several agents inhibits growth more effectively than either agent alone. These combinations inhibit BRAF-mutant melanoma and colorectal carcinoma cell lines, including cell lines with intrinsic or selected BRAF inhibitor resistance. Hence, combinations of dovitinib with second agents are potentially effective therapies for BRAF-mutant melanomas, regardless of their sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors.
