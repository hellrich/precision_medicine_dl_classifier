In this case report, we describe alterations of tumor morphology and patterns of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) expression in a patient who received GSK2118436, a second-generation RAF inhibitor, for stage IV (M1c) metastatic melanoma. To explore the effects of GSK2118436 on the expression patterns of CDKI (p16, p21, p27, p57), we immunohistochemically evaluated in vivo melanoma cells pre- and posttreated with GSK2118436. After GSK2118436 treatment, the melanoma cells decreased in size and demonstrated hyperchromatic nuclei and indistinct nucleoli. p16 was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of pretreated melanoma cells and in the nucleus and cytoplasm in posttreated melanoma cells. Expression of both p27 (nucleus) and p57 (cytoplasm) was increased in posttreated melanoma cells and no significant difference in p21 expression was noted in either pre- or posttreated tumor cells. These findings may help explain the molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells retain the ability to proliferate. The persistent activation of pro-oncogenic activities of CDKI (eg, p27 and p57) and/or compartmentalization of p16 in cytoplasm or nucleus may allow tumor cells to bypass BRAF-induced senescence mechanisms. Furthermore, awareness of changes in tumor morphology after treatment with RAF inhibitors may be helpful in histologic evaluation of the spectrum of dermatologic toxicity, which may occur on targeted therapy.","title":"Changes in tumor morphology and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor expression in metastatic melanoma treated with selective second-generation BRAF inhibitor.","pubmedId":"22878367"}
