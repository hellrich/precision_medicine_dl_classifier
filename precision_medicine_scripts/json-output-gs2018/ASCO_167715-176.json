Predominantly, hotspot mutations targeting BRAF (V600) or NRAS drive melanoma development and are associated with clinical benefit. Nonetheless, approximately 25-30% of melanomas do not present these hallmark events. This subgroup could benefit from in depth molecular analyses to inform the design of personalized therapeutic protocols. Here, we leveraged the largest collection to date (n \u003d 1929) of mutational and protein profiles of metastatic melanoma patients, the Caris Molecular IntelligenceTM database, to investigate molecular and actionable drivers. This database is purposefully skewed towards BRAF and NRAS wild-type tumors, making it particularly suitable for our analysis. Methods: We analyzed immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next generation sequencing (NGS) data available for 906 patient samples for which BRAF and NRAS status was available from Caris. We then defined three main melanoma subtypes characterized by mutations in BRAFV600 (n \u003d 253), NRAS (n \u003d 257, 8 also present BRAFV600), and wild-type for both (2xWT, n \u003d 404). Results: Within the 2xWT group, we could identify an enrichment for multiple oncogenic mutations impinging on MAPK signaling and including therapeutically actionable receptor tyrosine kinases. In details we found that 2xWT tumors are enriched for non-V600 BRAF mutations (13% of the 2xWT), KIT (9%), GNAQ (3%), GNA11 (5%), APC (7%), and MET (6%) which also shows elevated protein levels by IHC in 16% of the cases. Interestingly, these alterations are largely mutually exclusive with each other, strengthening the hypothesis of them acting as drivers. Different mutation subtypes show associations with divergent protein and mutation changes. Conclusions: Melanomapatients wild-type for BRAFV600 and NRAS hotspot mutations represent today a clinical challenge. This project oversampled for these tumors representing a particularly useful dataset to investigate secondary melanoma drivers. By analyzing these molecular profiles, we identified multiple oncogenic events significantly associated with 2xWT tumors, shedding new light on the genetic bases of this disease.","title":"Actionable secondary driver mutations in BRAFWT and NRASWT metastatic cutaneous melanoma using the Caris Molecular Intelligence profiling.","pubmedId":"ASCO_167715-176"}
