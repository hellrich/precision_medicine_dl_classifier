Since these findings, it was postulated that dual inhibition of BRAF and other components of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway (such as MEK) would be superior to BRAF inhibition as monotherapy. A series of recent clinical trials have confirmed this hypothesis.\nIn this article, the biological rationale for both single and concomitant inhibitions of the MAPK pathway in BRAF mutant melanoma is provided. Moreover, available clinical data on the efficacy and toxicity of BRAF and MEK inhibition as single agents and in combination are extensively reviewed.\nDual BRAF and MEK inhibition in advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma is superior to single inhibition in terms of efficacy without significant increase in toxicity. Therefore, BRAF plus MEK inhibition is expected to supersede single-agent BRAF inhibition in these patients in the near future.","title":"BRAF and MEK inhibition for the treatment of advanced BRAF mutant melanoma.","pubmedId":"26001180"}
