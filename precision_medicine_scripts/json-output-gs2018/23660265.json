Genomic DNA was extracted from her peripheral blood leukocytes and her parents. Tenth to sixteenth exons of RET proto-oncogene, including the flanking regions of introns, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). And the mutations of RET proto-oncogene were identified by direct sequencing.\nMEN-2B was diagnosed by the clinical presentations, laboratory tests and radiological findings. Gene analysis confirmed heterozygous mis-sense mutation at codon 918 in exon 16 of RET proto-oncogene in which thymine was replaced by cytosine (ATGâ†’ACG). Her thyroid medullary carcinoma was treated by radical operations and radiotherapy. Tyrosinase inhibitor sorafenib was administered for 2 months and watery diarrhea and cough were alleviated. The drug was withdrawn because of such intolerant side effects as hair loss and painful rashes. She had a survival time of over 14 years with multiple system tumor metastases.\nThe mutation analysis of RET proto-oncogene confirmed the diagnosis of MEN2B in respect of molecular genetics. For patients with advanced MTC, tyrosinase inhibitors may relieve the symptoms and provide a new therapeutic choice.","title":"[Clinical manifestations, therapeutic response to tyrosinase inhibitor and RET gene activating mutation in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B].","pubmedId":"23660265"}
