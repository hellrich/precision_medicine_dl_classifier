Four-minute exercise stages were performed on a ski treadmill at 67, 94, 121, 148, and 174 m.min-1 on a 1.7% grade and at 67, 94, and 121 m.min-1 on a 7.1% grade. Whole blood lactate concentration, heart rate, oxygen consumption (VO2) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were determined at each exercise stage. Blood lactate concentrations were not significantly different between double poling and diagonal striding at the 1.7% grade. However, the blood lactate concentrations were higher during double poling at the 7.1% grade for all speeds. Blood lactate concentrations were also higher for double poling at the 7.1% grade when compared with diagonal striding at 70% of technique specific peak VO2, a heart rate of 145 and a RPE of 12. We conclude that blood lactate concentrations do not offer physiological justification for choosing one technique over the other when skiing on low grades, but low blood lactate concentrations may provide a physiological advantage for diagonal striding on steep grades.","title":"Lactate response to uphill roller skiing: diagonal stride versus double pole techniques.","pubmedId":"8587494"}
