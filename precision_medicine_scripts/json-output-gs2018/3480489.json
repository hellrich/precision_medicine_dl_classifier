This study identifies certain differences in age, gender, and site between the two groups. The age at removal of the first keratocyst is significantly lower in the syndrome group. On more thorough examination, patients with multiple keratocysts (excluding recurrences) are found to have other features of NBCCS. The term multiple cysts refers to the lifetime history of the patient and does not necessarily imply that more than one cyst is present at any one time.","title":"The odontogenic keratocyst and its occurrence in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.","pubmedId":"3480489"}
