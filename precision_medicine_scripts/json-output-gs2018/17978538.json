Here, we describe adenoid cystic carcinoma that developed in the peripherally in S(9) of the right lower lobe of an 84-year-old woman. Cell blocks prepared from the bronchial wash specimens exhibited the cribriform formation. An immunohistochemical examination of the surgically resected tumor revealed positive thyroid transcription factor-1 and c-kit staining. Exons 9 and 11 of c-kit in tumor cells were not mutated. We compared the clinical features of this patient with those of 10 others described in the English-language literature.","title":"Primary peripheral adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lung and literature comparison of features.","pubmedId":"17978538"}
