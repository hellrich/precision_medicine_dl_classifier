To investigate the incidence, spectrum, and distribution of activating K- and N-RAS mutations in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) patients, 204 CN-AML patients were screened. Activating K- and N-RAS mutations were detected in 3 of 204 (1.5 %) and 22 of 204 (10.8 %) CN-AML samples, respectively. RAS mutated patients presented with a lower percentage of bone marrow blasts (65 vs 80 %, P \u003d 0.022). RAS mutations tended to occur with nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1) mutations (P \u003d 0.079), and all three samples containing K-RAS mutations had concomitant NPM1 mutations. There was no significant overlap between K-RAS mutations and N-RAS, FLT3, CEBPA, IDH1/2, WT1 or MLL mutations. RAS mutation status did not impact relapse-free or overall survival of CN-AML patients. In contrast to reports of noncanonical RAS mutations in other cancers, including some leukemia subtypes, we only observed K- and N-RAS mutations in codons 12, 13, or 61 in CN-AML samples. Our findings suggest that while K-RAS mutations are infrequent in CN-AML, activating K-RAS mutations may cooperate with mutated NPM1 to induce leukemia.
