LOX is highly expressed in aggressive cancers; has been associated with a shorter survival and regulates cancer progression in a variety of human malignancies. Here, we report a new function of LOX in mitosis in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line (THJ-16T), breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB231) and HeLa cells. We show that LOX co-localizes to mitotic spindles from metaphase to telophase, and p-H3(Ser10)-positive cells harbor strong LOX staining. Further, purification of mitotic spindles from synchronized cells show that LOX fails to bind to microtubules in the presence of nocodazole, whereas paclitaxel treated samples showed enrichment in LOX expression suggesting that LOX binds to stabilized microtubules only. Functional studies of LOX depletion resulted in decreased cellular proliferation, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and formation of gigantic nuclei. Further, LOX knockdown led to reduced p-H3(Ser10), cyclin B1, CDK1, and Aurora B expression. Lastly, LOX knockdown significantly increased sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents that target microtubules and this effect was synergistic. Our results show identify a novel function of LOX in cancer cell mitosis, and that loss of LOX expression in cancer cells can enhanced effects of anti-microtubules agents used in cancer therapy.","title":"LOX is a novel mitotic spindle-associated protein essential for mitosis","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2727"}
