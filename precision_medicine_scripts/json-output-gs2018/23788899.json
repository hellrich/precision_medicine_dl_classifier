One of them is activation of protein kinase. Actually, any of these proteins at any level of the signaling cascade in a human cell can undergo mutation and cause irregular cellular proliferation and finally result in cancer. C-kit is alternatively called stem cell factor receptor (SCFR) or CD117. It appears that lack of c-kit expression accompanies progression of some tumors, e.g. lung, breast, GIST. The aim of this study was to evaluate C-kit protein expression level within cancer cases.\nSixty specimens of breast cancer and 60 non-cancerous breast tissue specimens were evaluated by IHC for C-kit presentation. We used positive GIST slides as controls. Epi-info ver 6.04 (CDC, WHO) was used for analysis.\nC-kit was negative in all breast cancer specimens. C-kit was negative in 47 (78%) of 60 non-cancerous breast tissue specimens, but was positive in 13 (22%) of them (p \u003c 0.0001).\nThere is a reduction in C-kit expression with malignant transformation of breast epithelium. C-kit is believed to play a role in breast carcinogenesis. However, we should follow patients with normal or benign breast tissue to indicate any correlation between C-kit presentation and breast cancer development.","title":"Expression of c-kit protein in cancer vs. normal breast tissue.","pubmedId":"23788899"}
