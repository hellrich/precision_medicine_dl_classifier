Megakaryocytic blast crisis as the presenting manifestation of CML is extremely rare. We describe such a patient with no prior hematologic disease who presented with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and extramedullary involvement, in whom the leukemic cells carried the BCR-ABL1 translocation as part of a complex karyotype. Using targeted sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (T-FISH) technique, we detected two copies of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in the leukemic blasts while the neutrophils carried a single copy of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, thereby proving the origin of the megakaryoblastic leukemia from a previously undiagnosed CML clone. Blast crisis as a presenting manifestation of CML is rare and detecting clonal evolution of acute leukemia by specialized cytogenetic techniques may have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.","title":"Megakaryocytic blast crisis as a presenting manifestation of chronic myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"18417213"}
