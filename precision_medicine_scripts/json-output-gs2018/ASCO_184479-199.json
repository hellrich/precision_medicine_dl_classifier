Methods: Consecutive, unselected patients with recently diagnosed PDAC from three centers were enrolled from May to December 2016 in an ongoing prospective study. A three-generation pedigree was obtained. Germline mutations in 12 genes associated with PDAC risk (APC, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, PALB2, PMS2, STK11, TP53) and in 19 genes related to other cancer risks were screened for by NGS. American College of Gastroenterology and NCCN criteria for genetic testing for BRCA1/2, Lynch syndrome, and Familial Pancreatic Cancer (FPC) were assessed. Results: Among 183 patients, 46% are female, 79% are Caucasian and 10% are Ashkenazi Jewish, with median (IQR) age 68 (62,75) years at diagnosis. 41% of patients met 1 criteria for genetic testing (35.5% BRCA1/2, 2.7% Lynch, 9.3% FPC). Twenty patients (11%) were found to have a total of 21 pathogenic mutations (table). Mutation status was not associated with age at diagnosis, sex, or personal history of cancer (all p \u003e 0.05). Six mutation carriers (30% of positives) did not meet current criteria for genetic testing. Conclusions: Preliminary results show that 6.6% of unselected PDAC patients carry a germline mutation in a gene known to increase PDAC risk and 4.3% have a mutation in genes not previously linked to PDAC. Existing testing criteria did not identify 30% of carriers. Continued refinement of guidelines is necessary to align genetic testing with inherited PDAC risk.
