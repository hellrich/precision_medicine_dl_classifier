BFA inhibited phosphorylation of ALK and its downstream molecule, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), one of the central pathways for the survival of ALK+ ALCL cells. In HL cell lines BFA did not affect CD30 expression or constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity, both of which are critical for HL cell survival. BFA induced disruption of the Golgi apparatus in ALK+ ALCL cell lines, which was accompanied by a decrease in active ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), whereas BFA had no significant effect on these parameters in HL cell lines. These results add extra insights into the biological distinction between ALK+ ALCL and HL cells and highlight the Golgi apparatus as a target for the treatment of ALK+ ALCL.
