Activating mutations of FLT3 are now recognized as the most common molecular abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia, and FLT3 mutations may play a role in other hematologic malignancies as well. The poor prognosis of patients harboring these mutations renders FLT3 an obvious target of therapy. This review summarizes the data on the molecular biology and clinical impact of FLT3 mutations, as well as the therapeutic potential of several small-molecule FLT3 inhibitors currently in development.","title":"FLT3: ITDoes matter in leukemia.","pubmedId":"12970773"}
