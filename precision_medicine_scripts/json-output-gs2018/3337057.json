Age-standardized morbidity rates (ASMR) have declined significantly in males (p \u003d 0.011) and females (p \u003d 0.0011) during the period studied by, on average, 0.20 fewer new cases per 100,000 population per yr. The significant declines in ASMRs are attributable to significant declines in age-specific rates for males aged 35-44 (p \u003d 0.013) and 55-64 (p \u003d 0.046) and females aged 55-64, 65-74, and 75-84 yr (p less than 0.015). Significant declines in age-standardized death rates (ASDR) have also occurred in both males and females (p \u003d 0.0001), with 15 of the 16 age-sex groups studied showing significant rates of decline (p less than 0.0005). The greatest rates of decline were noted for males and females aged 75-84, where age-specific rates have declined by more than 4.2 deaths per 100,000 population per yr since 1931.","title":"The epidemiology of malignant neoplasms of the stomach in Canada during the period 1931-1984.","pubmedId":"3337057"}
