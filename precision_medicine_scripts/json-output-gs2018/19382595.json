In women is the incidence of lung cancer 30/100 000. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 70% to 75% of all lung cancers, while small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 25% to 30% of cases. These two types of lung cance have a different biological characteristics which leads to a different approach in the treatment of NSCLC and SCLC. The treatment of NSCLC is based on clinical stage of disease and different treatment modalities alone or in combination are used: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and recently a novel treatment strategy--targeted therapy with biologic agents.","title":"[Treatment of non small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"19382595"}
