CT of the head revealed a large haemorrhagic cystic lesion. A subsequent chest CT revealed a large left atrial mass. The mass was subsequently biopsied with positive immunohistochemistry staining for MDM2, FLI1 and vimentin. Real-time PCR revealed MDM2 amplification, confirming the diagnosis of intimal sarcoma. The patient underwent surgical resection and reconstruction of the atrium with subsequent discharge to short-term rehabilitation, but his symptoms continued to progress. A repeat CT of the head revealed a new cerebellar mass. He underwent a second resection, but continued to experience worsening symptoms. He was diagnosed with stage IV intimal sarcoma and referred to hospice. The patient died 5 months after initial presentation. Autopsy was performed and revealed the cause of death as pneumonia. There was no involvement of the pulmonic or aortic vessels. ","title":"Intimal (spindle cell) sarcoma of the left atrium presenting with abnormal neurological examination.","pubmedId":"26483389"}
