Loss of PTEN and/or PI 3K mutations have been associated with enhanced susceptibility to PX-866. PX-866 is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial to determine the MTD, and measure safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints in PBMCs and tumor tissue in patients with solid tumors. Methods: Patients with advanced metastatic cancers receive PX-866 orally once daily for 5 of 7 days for 2 weeks in a 28-day cycle. Dose levels of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 8, and 10 mg are planned. PK and PD samples are collected days 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, and 15 of cycle one and days 1 and 12 of cycle two. A PD assay has been developed that utilizes flow cytometry to test the inhibition of S6RP and mTOR in PBMC. Once the MTD of this PX-866 schedule of administration has been identified, an expansion cohort is planned to investigate tumor PD events and correlate tumor and PBMC endpoints with efficacy. Results: Four cohorts (0.5, 1, 2, 3 mg) comprising 12 patients (age 42-74, median PS 1) have completed accrual, with the 4.5 mg cohort actively enrolling. The total number of cycles to date is 30 (median 2, range 1-5+). Abdominal discomfort and mild diarrhea have been possibly associated with PX-866. No drug-related severe adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities have occurred. Of the 6 patients treated in the first 2 cohorts, 3 previously progressing patients had stable disease (SD) as best response and were on study for 105, 147 and 162+ (still active) days. Two patients (squamous cell skin cancer and melanoma) had decrease in pain allowing discontinuation of analgesics. Proof-of-concept PD studies in PBMCs evidenced a dose dependent inhibition of both p-S6RP and p-mTOR levels. Conclusions: PX-866 is a novel oral PI-3K inhibitor that is undergoing development in a clinical trial with built-in PD endpoints. PX-866 has shown to have a mild side effect profile while inducing stabilization of disease in previously progressing cancer patients. Oral PX-866 provides target inhibition even at low drug doses and inhibition is maintained for an extended time following the last dose. Updated clinical, PK and PD results will be presented.","title":"Phase I trial of PX-866, a novel phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI-3K) inhibitor.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32284-65"}
