Treatment consisted of temozolomide given alone or was followed by combined cytokine immunotherapy, given every three to four weeks, with an evaluation of response following two treatment-cycles. S-100B values were measured prior to and following each cycle of systemic therapy and regularly thereafter. Patients with normal initial S-100B values (n\u003d32) had higher response rates and fewer and more favourable metastatic sites with better overall survival rates than patients with elevated S-100B levels (median 14.0 versus 6.6 months). Normal S-100B values increased in nearly all patients (28/31) after a median of 7.9 months. In addition, patients with rapid normalisation of their serum level (n\u003d12) following systemic treatment experienced prolonged survival. However, upon multivariable analysis S-100B prior to treatment lost its independence as a prognostic factor, whereas lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) remained. When measured after treatment, both markers had independent value.","title":"Normal values of serum S-100B predict prolonged survival for stage IV melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"15691637"}
