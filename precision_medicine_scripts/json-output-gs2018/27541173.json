The authors report a case of metastatic malignant melanoma where both morphology and immunohistochemistry were altered after treatment. This 51-year-old patient presented with metastatic melanoma to the brain and axilla. Initially, both metastases showed classic morphology and diffuse staining with the pan-melanoma antibody cocktail. This cocktail is a combination of 3 antibodies commonly used to diagnose melanocytic neoplasms: Melan-A (MART-1), tyrosinase, and HMB-45. In combination, the cocktail is highly sensitive for detecting melanocytic neoplasms and is commonly used to diagnose metastatic melanoma. Her tumor was positive for the BRAF 1799T\u003eA (V600E) mutation, and she was treated with BRAF inhibitor therapy (vemurafenib). However, the axillary tumor recurred after treatment with vemurafenib. The recurrent tumor showed a markedly different morphology and complete loss of staining with the pan-melanoma antibody cocktail. This loss of staining accompanied by the change in morphology was an observation not previously documented after therapy with vemurafenib. This case demonstrates a potential pitfall in the diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma.
