We analyzed, with emphasis on both disease- and therapy-related prognostic factors, the results from a 9-year trial in 65 adults with M3 and M3v APL, treated homogenously with a short-term therapy (STT) program excluding maintenance. STT comprised a maximum of six courses with doxorubicin, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), and 6-thioguanine. Sixty-five APL patients formed the study group, M3v accounting for 25% of cases. In M3v, the absolute blast cell count was significantly higher (p \u003c 0.0001) and early hemorrhagic deaths were more frequent (p \u003d 0.05). The blast count correlated inversely with the probability of remission (p \u003d 0.005), poor-risk patients being those with \u003e 10 x 10(9)/l blast cells. During the study, the median survival improved from 0.1 to 2.7 years (p \u003d \u003c 0.005). In first place, response to chemotherapy increased from 42 to 84% (p \u003d 0.006), by giving daily prophylactic platelet transfusions (to \u003e 30 x 10(9)/l) and no heparin (course I), and by avoiding too toxic high-dose ara-C and deferring treatment in infected/neutropenic patients showing the atypical differentiative bone marrow pattern (course II). Secondly, the probability of first unmaintained remission differed significantly between patients given intentionally more than four total chemotherapy courses or intermediate/high-dose ara-C consolidation (0.59 at 5 years) and those treated less intensively (0.21) (p \u003c 0.005). Intensive STT was very effective for the management of adult APL patients at standard hemorrhagic risk and receiving optimal supportive care. In high-risk patients with hyperleukocytosis and M3v, induction results could be improved by the concomitant use of ATRA. M3v in adults must be recognized promptly because of the very high early hemorrhagic risk.","title":"Short-term treatment for adult hypergranular and microgranular acute promyelocytic leukemia.","pubmedId":"7869758"}
