Mortality was modeled using semiparametric survival techniques. All cause and cause-specific mortality analyses were performed. Mortality was compared with expected mortality from the U.S. census data.\nA total of 731 patients were studied, and 710 (97%) of these had medium or large melanomas. The mean tumor diameter was 11.3 mm, and the mean tumor thickness was 5.8 mm. Ciliary body was involved in 122 (17%) of patients. Complete follow-up was available on 99.6% (728 of 731) of patients.\nThe authors analyzed the distribution and causes of post-treatment mortality.\nThe 5- and 10-year all-cause Kaplan-Meier survival rates were 75.6% and 62.3%, respectively. Both melanoma risk factors (older age, ciliary body involvement, and larger tumor diameter) and nonmelanoma risk factors (older age and medical condition) were significant prognostic factors of all-cause mortality. Deaths from nonmelanoma causes accounted for 91 (42.3%) of 215 deaths. The 5-year and 10-year estimates of nonmelanoma deaths were 8.3% and 15.9%, respectively. Nonmelanoma mortality was similar to that observed in the general U.S. population (91 observed, 98.1 expected). Melanoma metastases accounted for 124 (57.7%) of 215 deaths. The 5- and 10-year estimates for probability of metastatic death were 16.1% and 21.8%, respectively. The largest tumor diameter was the best predictor for melanoma mortality; ciliary body involvement, older age, and distance from the fovea also were significant in multivariate analyses.\nA significant proportion of patients with uveal melanoma die of nonmelanoma causes after radiation. In analyzing prognostic factors, considerable information may be lost if analyses are based on all-cause mortality rather than cause-specific mortality.","title":"A comparison of cause-specific melanoma mortality and all-cause mortality in survival analyses after radiation treatment for uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"9818602"}
