Here, we describe a role of DRAK1 (DAP kinase-related apoptosis-inducing kinase 1) in head and neck cancer cells. DRAK1 is significantly overexpressed in primary head and neck tumors and cell lines. Overexpression of DRAK1 decreased the TGF-1-induced transcriptional activity and expression of tumor suppressor target genes, including p15, p21, whereas DRAK1 silencing enhanced. Furthermore, endogenous depletion of DRAK1 enhanced the TGF-1-induced cell growth inhibition and suppressed the tumorigenic ability of head and neck cancer cells in vivo. Interestingly, the gain- or loss-of-function of DRAK1 did not change the TGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3. DRAK1 specifically binds to Smad3 through its kinase domain, thereby blocking recruitment of Smad4 and translocation of Smad3 into nucleus. Thus, our findings suggest that aberrant expression of DRAK1 increases tumorigenic potential through the inhibition of TGF-1 tumor suppressor activity in head and neck cancer cells.*This work was supported by a National Research Foundation grant of Korea (2009-0081756) funded by the Korea government.","title":"DRAK1 overexpressed in head and neck cancer suppresses the TGF-1 tumor suppressor activity in head and neck cancer cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4411"}
