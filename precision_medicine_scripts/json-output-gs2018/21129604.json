In the metastatic setting the objective of treatment is to manage symptoms, improve quality of life and prolong survival, but current treatment options have limited efficacy and some of them exhibit unfavourable toxicity profiles. Fluoropyrimidine, taxanes and platinum-based regimens are used most frequently and offer a response rate of 30-50% with a median overall survival of \u003d1 year. These discouraging data support the need for new therapeutic strategies based on targeted drugs. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against HER2, has shown survival benefits when given with chemotherapy in all setting of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. The ToGA trial, the first study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy in HER-2 positive advanced gastric cancer, showed a significant superiority of combination over chemotherapy alone. Based on these results trastuzumab combined with a cisplatin and fluoropyrimidine regimen appear the new reference treatment for HER-2 positive metastatic gastric cancer.","title":"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in gastric cancer: a new therapeutic target.","pubmedId":"21129604"}
