Both were treated by simultaneous pneumonectomy and oesophagectomy. The postoperative course of each patient was complicated by secondary infection of the pneumonectomy space. One patient expired from a recurrent intratracheal tumour on the 83rd postoperative day and the other remains tumour free 3 years after treatment. As few therapeutic alternatives exist for non small cell bronchial carcinoma, primary radical surgical treatment should be considered, even in advanced cases where the tumour invades the oesophagus.","title":"Simultaneous pneumonectomy and esophagectomy for bronchial carcinoma.","pubmedId":"1873042"}
