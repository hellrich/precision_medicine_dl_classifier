There are two significant signs indicating malignancy of a melanoma, that is, abnormal melanin distribution in dermis layer and a peripheral blood net. We developed a multi-spectral optical Nevoscope aimed to diagnosing malignant melanoma non-invasively. An algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the melanoma in terms of Nevoscope geometry. The algorithm has been verified on an optical tumor model at 580 nm and 800 nm. The reconstructed melanoma is consistent with the tumor model which suggests a great potential of using Nevoscope to investigate malignant melanoma.","title":"Non-invasive diagnosing malignant melanoma by multi-spectral optical Nevoscope.","pubmedId":"17946192"}
