The majority of cases (98.3%) were reported by hospital inpatient/outpatient clinics. Histopathologic confirmation was available in 2804 cases (72.1% for all years). The mean age-adjusted incidence of uveal melanoma in the United States was 5.1 per million (95% CI, 4.8-5.3). The majority of cases (97.8%) occurred in the white population. There was a statistically significant variation of age-adjusted incidence between sexes (male \u003d 5.8, 95% CI, 5.5-6.2; and female \u003d 4.4, 95% CI, 4.2-4.7). A decreasing trend was observed in patients treated with surgery alone (93.8% for 1973-1975 vs. 28.3% for 2006-2008), whereas a corresponding increase was seen in those treated with radiation (1.8% for 1973-1975 vs. 62.5% for 2006-2008). No change in the 5-year relative survival rate (81.6%) was observed from 1973 to 2008.\nThe age-adjusted incidence of uveal melanoma (5.1 per million) has remained unchanged from 1973 to 2008. Despite a shift toward more conservative treatments, survival has not improved during this time period.","title":"Uveal melanoma: trends in incidence, treatment, and survival.","pubmedId":"21704381"}
