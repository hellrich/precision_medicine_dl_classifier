It consists of the formation of an acquired fistula between the left circumflex coronary artery and the left atrium in a patient who was operated two years prior to its clinical presentation. Significant coronary steal gave rise to disabling angina and prompted a second operation to close the fistula. The diagnosis was made with selective arteriogram that clearly delineated the fistulous tract and surgery was accomplished without extracorporeal circulation.","title":"Acquired left coronary artery to left atrium fistula: unusual complication of aortocoronary bypass.","pubmedId":"3485103"}
