Anti-EGFR antibodies bind competitively to EGFRs to inhibit receptor activation and subsequent signal transduction of the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway and PI3K/AKT pathway. By inhibiting EGFR-mediated signal transduction, anti-EGFR antibodies inhibit cell growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, and they induce apoptosis. The IgG1-type antibody cetuximab is also capable of inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Several studies have shown that KRAS mutation is a useful biomarker for predicting the efficacy of anti-EGFR agents, and the major guidelines for the treatment of CRC recommend the use of anti-EGFR antibody only for the cancers with wild-type KRAS. Alterations of other genes, including BRAF, NRAS, PTEN and AKT, and EGFR expression/gene copy number have also been reported to be candidate biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of anti-EGFR agents. The predictive values of these biomarkers are still controversial and further investigations are required.","title":"Biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody in the treatment of colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"24458108"}
