Some well-known examples are the differential diagnosis between aneurysmal bone cyst and telangiectatic osteosarcoma and giant cell tumor versus giant cell-containing highly malignant osteosarcoma. As a new approach to these diagnostic problems, we analyzed the genetic instability in a larger number of bone-forming tumor-like lesions, benign and malignant osteoblastic tumors. Analysis focused on genetic alterations in cell cycle regulator genes: Mutations in the p53 gene and ras gene, loss of heterozygosity at the p53, p16 and Rb-locus, and amplification of the mdm2 gene and the c-myc-gene. In addition to cell cycle regulators, the telomerase activity has also been analyzed. The results show that the number of genetic alterations increases with the malignancy of the tumors. The highest number of genetic alterations could thus be found in conventional intraosseous osteosarcoma. In tumor-like lesions, genetic alterations have rarely been observed. The results of this study show that the analysis of genetic instability will probably contribute to an improved differential diagnosis of osteoblastic tumors.","title":"[Genetic instability in osteoblastic tumors of the skeletal system].","pubmedId":"10095425"}
