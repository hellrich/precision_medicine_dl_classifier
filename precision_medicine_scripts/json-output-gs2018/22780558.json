Chemopreventive strategies are needed to reduce the formation of new BCC in these patients. Appropriate evidence-based guidelines for photodynamic therapy chemoprevention in NBCCS do not exist. We herein report one patient treated with methyl aminolevulinate PDT with red light (630â€‰nm) activation to continue sustained chemoprevention following other BCC chemopreventive modalities and a relevant literature review.","title":"A possible chemopreventive role for photodynamic therapy in Gorlin syndrome: a report of basal cell carcinoma reduction and review of literature.","pubmedId":"22780558"}
