No LOH was seen in pure intraductal carcinomas (0/20 cases). On the other hand, LOH was observed in 40% (17/42) of invasive carcinomas (P \u003d 0.0005). Interestingly, in situ lesions found in invasive tumors displayed LOH. Allelic loss was also significantly associated with loss of the estrogen receptor (P \u003d 0.011). Thus, loss of the 10q23 is strongly associated with tumor progression.","title":"Allelic loss of chromosome 10q23 is associated with tumor progression in breast carcinomas.","pubmedId":"9671321"}
