The tyrosine kinase receptor erbB2 was first linked to the amplification and overexpression of erbb2 gene in a subtype of breast tumor cells, which is indicative of highly proliferative cells and likely a poor prognosis following conventional chemotherapy. The development of targeted therapies to block the survival of erbB2-positive cancer cells revealed that impaired NRG1 signaling through erbB2/erbB4 heterodimers combined with anthracycline chemotherapy may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy in a subpopulation of treated patients. The ventricular-specific deletion of either erbb2 or erbb4 manifested dilated cardiomyopathy, which is aggravated by the administration of doxorubicin. Based on the exacerbated toxicity displayed by the combined treatment, it is expected that the relevant pathways would be affected in a synergistic manner. This review examines the NRG1 activities that were monitored in different model systems, focusing on the emerging pathways and molecular targets, which may aid in understanding the acquired dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs under the conditions of NRG1-deficient signaling.
