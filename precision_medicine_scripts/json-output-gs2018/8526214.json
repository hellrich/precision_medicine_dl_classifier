Specifically, MCL are clonal B-cell neoplasms and often harbor bcl-1 gene rearrangements. Although this genetic profile is well documented, scant or no data are available on the molecular assessment of MCL using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue as a sample source. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to study bcl-1 and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements (B-cell clonality) using formalin-fixed tissue from 12 cases of MCL. In addition, 12 cases of low grade B-cell lymphoma and 5 cases of reactive lymphocytic hyperplasia were studied as comparison controls. A hemi-nested PCR assay was developed to identify major translocation cluster (MTC) bcl-1 gene rearrangements, whereas IgH gene rearrangements were evaluated by both a single-step and hemi-nested approach. Bcl-1 gene rearrangements were amplified in 4 of 12 (33%) MCL, but in none of the controls. With the hemi-nested approach, B-cell monoclonality was demonstrated in 11 of 12 (92%) MCL; 6 of 6 (100%) small lymphocytic lymphomas; 1 of 2 marginal zone lymphomas; 1 of 4 follicular lymphomas; and 0 of 5 reactive lymphocytic hyperplasias. When one-step PCR was used for B-cell clonality assessment, the overall detection rate was lower, specifically: 8 of 12 (67%) MCL; 4 of 6 (67%) small lymphocytic lymphomas; 1 of 2 marginal zone lymphomas; 0 of 4 follicular lymphomas; and 0 of 5 reactive lymphocytic hyperplasias were identified as monoclonal. We have demonstrated that MTC bcl-1 gene rearrangements can be amplified from formalin-fixed tissue. In addition, monoclonal B-cell populations from MCL are better amplified with a hemi-nested approach rather than a single-step PCR assay. With specialized nucleic acid isolation techniques and appropriate PCR protocol design, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is an adequate source of DNA for assessing MTC bcl-1 and IgH gene rearrangements.","title":"Detection of bcl-1 gene rearrangement and B-cell clonality in mantle cell lymphoma using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.","pubmedId":"8526214"}
