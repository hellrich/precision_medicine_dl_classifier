Statistical analysis assessed the association between the markers and their correlation with clinicopathological parameters and follow-up information.\nAbnormal E-cadherin distribution was found in 34 of the 82 gastric carcinomas (41%) (18/25 poorly cohesive or mixed (72%); 16/57 papillary or tubular type (28%)). HER1 overexpression (3+) and equivocal expression (2+) were found in five carcinomas (6%; four tubular and one poorly cohesive) and eight carcinomas (10%; six tubular and two poorly cohesive), respectively. HER2 overexpression (3+) and equivocal expression (2+) were found in seven carcinomas (8%; five papillary and two tubular) and three carcinomas (4%; three tubular), respectively. Amplification of HER1 or HER2 was detected in 14 gastric carcinomas (five papillary and nine tubular). All of them showed a normal E-cadherin distribution. In the univariate analysis, only HER1 amplification had a prognostic impact, while HER2 amplification and E-cadherin expression/distribution were not per se prognostically relevant.\nE-cadherin immunostaining and HER1 in situ hybridisation define a group of well differentiated gastric carcinomas with poor prognosis eligible for an aggressive therapeutic approach.","title":"Association of HER1 amplification with poor prognosis in well differentiated gastric carcinomas.","pubmedId":"24218028"}
