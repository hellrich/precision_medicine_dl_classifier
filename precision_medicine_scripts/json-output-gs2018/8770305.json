In cases in which tumors are inaccessible or TILs fail to grow, the adoptive transfer of allogeneic TILs, haplotype matched for the restriction element for a common tumor antigen, represents a possible treatment alternative. Such TILs show in vitro cross-reactivity for allogeneic tumors but have not been evaluated for in vivo activity.\nAn F1 hybrid mouse (C57BL/6 X DBA-2[B6D2 F1]) was used to generate TILs (F1 TILs) expressing both H-2b and H-2d class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) determinants, which were used to treat established autologous lung metastases in C57BL/6 (B6) parental strain mice.\nH-2b mice bearing the fully syngeneic MC-38 tumor were treated with F1 TILS, and a 98-100% reduction in 4-day-old established lung metastasis was achieved. However, B6 mice bearing MC-38 tumors after preimmunization with H-2d splenocytes did not show a response to F1 TILs. Preimmunization of B6 mice by intravenous injection of H-2d splenocytes at varying times before F1 TIL administration showed a dramatic reduction in F1 TIL efficacy when alloimmunization occurred as early as 2 days before therapy. Immunization against an unrelated haplotype (H-2s) sharing no MHC genes with the F1 TILs resulted in a smaller reduction of F1 TIL efficacy, possibly due to shared minor determinants.\nAllogeneic TILs sharing an MHC restriction element for a common tumor antigen can be used to successfully treat established metastases in the nonallosensitized host.","title":"Adoptive cellular immunotherapy of cancer in mice using allogeneic T-cells.","pubmedId":"8770305"}
