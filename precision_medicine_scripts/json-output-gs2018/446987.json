A small increase of RNase values was recognized with age in the normal subjects and in the patients with nonpancreatic diseases, if renal function was normal. The mean RNase level in the control subjects was 97 +/- 41.2 units. A marked elevation of serum RNase level was demonstrated in the patients with pancreatic cancer (p less than 0.001) and in the patients with renal dysfuction, but no significant rise was noticed in the patients with pancreatitis. Mean values of RNase in the patients with pancreatic cancer and renal dysfuncton were 368 +/- 146 units and 342 +/- 78.1 units respectively. RNase values above 300 units were recognized in 15(71%) out of 21 patients with pancreatic cancer. Seven cases with elevated RNase over 300 units other than non-pancreatic malignancy and renal dysfunction were noticed in 6 instances of obstructive jaundice and in one instance of early gastric cancer (an 84-year-old male). The above-stated findings indicate that serum RNase determinations can be utilized as a diagnostic indicator for pancreatic cancer.","title":"Assessment of the clinical usefulness of serum ribonuclease assays: an indicator for the detection of pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"446987"}
