It permitted easy and rapid discrimination of six phenotypes determined by ESD*1, ESD*2 and ESD*7. Experiments showed it to be practicable in forensic stain work. In addition, this technique was also usable in phenotyping of ESD 5.","title":"Esterase D phenotyping of bloodstains and hair roots by low voltage isoelectric focusing.","pubmedId":"4018683"}
