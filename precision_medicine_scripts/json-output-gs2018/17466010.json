A heterozygous V804M mutation in exon 14 of the RET was found in the index case and in four relatives. Total thyroidectomy, performed in four of five affected members in this kindred, disclosed a medullary thyroid carcinoma in the index case and in a 50-year-old woman, and nodular C-cell hyperplasia in the other two subjects.\nThis clinical case suggests that individuals carrying the germline V804M mutation should be screened annually for the presence of pheochromocytoma.","title":"Asymptomatic bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma in a patient with a germline V804M mutation in the RET proto-oncogene.","pubmedId":"17466010"}
