Despite this initial benefit, tumors ultimately progress but may respond to next generation kinase inhibitors allowing for tailored therapy at the time of resistance. Here we report on the resistance mechanisms in the largest series of ROS1+ and an expanded cohort of ALK+ pts after progression on targeted therapy using next generation sequencing (NGS). Methods: Testing was performed on a total of 7 ROS1+ and 34 ALK+ pts, including 6 ALK+ pts with multiple biopsies. We analyzed tumor tissue from 3 pts with ROS1+ and 13ALK+ pts with a custom capture-based next NGS panel of 48 genes including ALK, ROS1, EGFR, and RAS using at least 50ng of DNA. The remainder of ALK and ROS1 tumor samples were subjected to a multiplex mutation assay and/or direct sequencing of DNA or RT-PCR products to evaluate for kinase domain mutations. ALK and ROS1 FISH were performed to evaluate for copy number alterations. Results: Of theROS1+ pts who demonstrated radiologic progression on crizotinib we found that 1/5 (20%)tumor samples harbored 2 different resistance mutations in the kinase domain of ROS1: the gatekeeper L2026M [19% variant allele frequency (VAF)] and also L1951R (9% VAF), neither of which have been reported in pts before. Of the ALK+ pts who progressed on crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, or brigatinib, 9/34 (26%) were found to have ALK kinase domain resistance mutations including a patient with a novel compound (in cis) mutation of S1206Y and E1210K and another patient with a G1202S, both following treatment with a next generation ALK inhibitor. One additional ALK+ patient was found to have an EGFR mutation, but no RAS mutations were identified in this updated series of resistance samples. Conclusions: Novel ROS1 and ALK resistance mutations were identified by a custom NGS panel, including 2 pts with coincident resistance mutations in a single tumor sample. Only 25% (10/39) of ALK+ and ROS1+ pts have kinase domain mutations suggesting other mechanisms of drug resistance in the majority of these pts.","title":"Resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies in ROS1+ and ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_163863-176"}
