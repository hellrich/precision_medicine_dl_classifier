In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of YM155 alone, and in combination with docetaxel (TXT) against human malignant melanoma (MM) cells. Methods: Antiproliferative effect of YM155 was evaluated by sulforhodamine B assay. Intracellular mRNA and protein levels of apoptosis related biomarkers, cell viability and caspase 3/7 activity were evaluated after the treatment with survivin siRNA or YM155TXT. The in vivo antitumor activities were evaluated in A375 and SK-MEL-5 human MM cell xenografted nude mice model. Results: YM155 showed potent in vitro antiproliferative activity against human MM cells with GI50 values ranging from 1.2 to 297 nM, regardless of BRAF, p53, N-Ras and K-Ras mutation status. YM155 suppressed survivin expression, leading to cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in the same way as survivin siRNA did. In SK-MEL-5 cells, YM155 significantly enhanced TXT induced cell growth inhibition, caspase 3/7 activity and apoptosis. The survivin protein was increased by the treatment of TXT and completely suppressed in YM155-TXT combination. In the human MM xenograft models, continuous infusion of YM155 induced tumor regression without body weight loss. Concomitant administration of YM155 (2 mg/kg/day) and TXT (20 mg/kg/day) showed more significant antitumor activities than the administration of each single agent, including complete regression without exacerbation of body weight loss. Conclusions: YM155 potentiates the efficacy of TXT against MM in vitro and in vivo, by down regulating TXT-induced survivin expression. These results provide a rationale for YM155-TXT combination against MM. Further clinical investigation of YM155-TXT combination for the treatment of MM is worthwhile.","title":"Antitumor activity of YM155, a novel survivin suppressant, in combination with docetaxel against malignant melanoma cells.","pubmedId":"ASCO_42621-74"}
