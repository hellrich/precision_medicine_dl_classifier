{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"In the crystal of the title compound, C(12)H(10)ClNO(2)S, the asymmetric unit contains two independent mol-ecules. The N-C bonds in the C-SO(2)-NH-C segments have gauche torsions with respect to the S\u003dO bonds. The mol-ecules are twisted at the S atoms with C-SO(2)-NH-C torsion angles of -53.8 (3) and -63.4 (3)° in the two mol-ecules. The benzene rings are tilted relative to each other by 69.1 (1) and 82.6 (1)°. The dihedral angle between the sulfonyl benzene rings of the two independent mol-ecules is 23.7 (2)°. The crystal structure features inversion-related dimers linked by N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds.","title":"4-Chloro-N-phenyl-benzene-sulfonamide.","pubmedId":"21754543"}
