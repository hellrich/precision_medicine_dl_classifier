Original pathology reports were reviewed. Age-standardized melanoma incidence rates were compared from 1989 to 2004 with annual percentage change using Poisson regression.\nThe incidence of thick tumors (\u003e4 mm) increased by 3.8% (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 6.2) and 2.5% (95% confidence interval -0.5 to 5.5) per year for male and female patients, respectively. The median thickness of NM at diagnosis was 2.6 mm compared with 0.6 mm for superficial spreading melanoma. A third of patients who died from melanoma during the follow-up period had thick tumors (\u003e4 mm), most of which were nodular subtype (61%). NM accounted for 14% of invasive melanomas, but was responsible for 43% of melanoma deaths in a total of 57,461 person-years of follow-up. By comparison, superficial spreading melanoma contributed 56% of invasive melanoma but only 30% of deaths.\nPathology review was limited to reports only. Mortality information relied mostly on death certificate information.\nThe incidence of thick melanomas continues to increase. Nodular melanoma is clinically distinct and the predominant contributor to melanoma-related deaths, representing a public health challenge in reducing skin cancer mortality.","title":"Nodular melanoma: a distinct clinical entity and the largest contributor to melanoma deaths in Victoria, Australia.","pubmedId":"23182058"}
