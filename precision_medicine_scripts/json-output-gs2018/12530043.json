This study measured serum and urinary c-erbB-2 levels in patients with gastric cancer, assessing their role in cancer-specific survival and the effects of resectional surgery.\nSerum and urinary c-erbB-2 concentrations were measured with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 41 healthy controls and in 54 gastric cancer patients. Serum and urinary c-erbB-2 levels in cancer patients were determined before and 7 days following tumour surgery.\nPreoperative serum and urinary c-erbB-2 levels in gastric cancer patients were significantly higher than those in controls although there were no significant associations between these levels and tumour pathology. Serum c-erbB-2 levels decreased significantly after radical resection of the primary tumour and were an independent prognostic factor for survival, whereas there were no changes in urinary c-erbB-2 levels after surgery or an association with patient survival.\nGastric cancer patients show higher serum and urinary c-erbB-2 levels compared to healthy controls. Preoperative serum c-erbB-2 concentration decreases significantly after radical resection of the primary tumour and is an independent prognostic factor for patient survival.","title":"Clinical significance of soluble c-erbB-2 levels in the serum and urine of patients with gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"12530043"}
