Despite the initial activity of this agent, ROS1-positive cancers ultimately develop resistance to therapy. To evaluate mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib among ROS1-positive patients, we examined a series of repeat biopsies from ROS1-positive patients progressing on crizotinib. Methods: Medical records were reviewed and data extracted. Repeat biopsies were performed as part of routine clinical care or under institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocols. Specimens underwent Sanger-based sequencing of the ROS1 kinase domain or targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Results: We identified 10 ROS1-positive patients who underwent repeat biopsies following acquired resistance to crizotinib. One patient underwent resection of 2 separate central nervous system (CNS) metastases. The most common sites of tissue collection were the pleura/pleural fluid (N \u003d 4; 36%), brain (N \u003d 3; 27%), and lung (N \u003d 2; 18%). The median number of prior lines of therapy was 1 (range 0-5). Median progression-free survival (PFS) on crizotinib was 10.0 months (95% CI 5.77-26.37 months). A majority of patients (N \u003d 7; 63.6%) underwent repeat biopsies while still on crizotinib. ROS1 resistance mutations were identified in 5/11 (45%) specimens, including 5/8 (62.5%) non-CNS tissue samples. ROS1 resistance mutations were found at 2 residues: G2032R in 4 (36%) specimens and D2033N in 1 (9%) specimen. 3/6 samples that were negative for ROS1 resistance mutations underwent targeted NGS using Snapshot, revealing no additional significant genetic alterations. Conclusions: ROS1 resistance mutations are relatively frequent alterations in ROS1-positive lung cancers progressing on crizotinib, particularly among patients with disease progression outside of the CNS. The ROS1 G2032R solvent front mutation appears to be a dominant resistance mutation, underscoring the need for clinical development of next-generation ROS1 inhibitors with activity against this alteration.","title":"Frequency and spectrum of ROS1 resistance mutations in ROS1-positive lung cancer patients progressing on crizotinib.","pubmedId":"ASCO_171214-176"}
