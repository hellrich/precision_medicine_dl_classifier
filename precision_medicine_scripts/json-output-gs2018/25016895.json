Main objective was analyze the frecuency of positivity or negativity ofller/neu in patients with breast cancer after surgery and their relationship with hormone receptors. We perfomed a longitudinal, retrospective, descriptive and observational trial in all patients included in the Patology Service with a determination of Her-2/neu and hormone receptors analysis, between January 1st 2007 and December 31 st 2009.We used descriptive stadistic and association tests with correlation coefficients. We analyze 893 patients. The age range was between 24 and 94 years. The 16.% of all cases overexpressed Her-2/neu (150 patients). The 4.8% (43 patients) were included in the FISII test resulting in 29 positives to Her-2/neu. There were a total of 179 cases overexpressed. Negative estrogen receptores cases were 23%, negative progesterone receptores cases were 28% and triple negative receptors cases were 19%. We analyzed independient variables with Student I resulting age with P \u003d 0.294. We analyzed distribution variables with Pearson test resulting in negative estrogen receptors with a P \u003d 0.0001 negative progesterone receptres with a P \u003d 0.0001 and triple negative receptors P\u003d 0.0001. Relationship between hormone receptors and Her-2/neu in proporlionaly inverse in other vvords when a high hormone receptors negativitvis present there is algo a Her-2/neu highly overexpressed.","title":"[Frequency factor Her-2/neu overexpression in patients with breast cancer].","pubmedId":"25016895"}
