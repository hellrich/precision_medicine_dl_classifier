Recently, the World Health Organisation \u0026 Society of Haematopathology proposed a change in the categorization, with M6a and M6b subgroups of the original FAB classification. Hereby we report a case of acute erythroleukemia--M6b subtype, presented with pain abdomen and vomiting. The patient died within two days. The case is being reported for its rarity and uncommon presentation.","title":"Acute erythroleukemia--M6B.","pubmedId":"12035366"}
