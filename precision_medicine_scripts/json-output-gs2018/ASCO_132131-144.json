Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) represents heterogeneous group of lesions and reliable prognostic markers  are still missing.  Numerous studies focus on elucidating the pathways of carcinogenesis and understanding the lesions origin or future behaviour. Recent studies have drawn attention to the prognostic value of p16, COX-2 and Ki67 as markers of locoregional invasive recurrences in DCIS due to abrogated response to cellular stress. In addition, the influence of the microenvironment seem to be important in determining lesions future behaviour. In our case-control study we compared expression levels of the three promising prognostic markers (p16, COX-2, Ki67) in in situ lesions, existing as part of different tumors   in situ lesions within pure DCIS, microinvasive tumor (T1mic) and invasive tumor with extensive intraductal component (IDC with EIC). We hypothesized different expression phenotype according to progression level of the surrounding tumors.  Methods:  Immunohistochemical examination was used to evaluate expression of COX-2, p16 and Ki67  in three subgroups of tumors (with and without invasive component): DCIS, T1mic and IDC with EIC. Expression was measured exclusively in in situ compounds. We examined 37 tumors operated at our clinic in 2000-2010.  Results:  We found increasing expression of COX-2 and p16 with rising severity of the diagnosis (gradually rising prevalence of overexpression from DCIS to T1mic and IDC).  Prevalence of p16 expression score 1 was the highest within DCIS, the lowest in IDC and p16 overexpression maintained the same tendency (overexpression in DCIS\u003cT1mic\u003cIDC), although this was not significant. Combination of COX-2 and p16 overexpression (COX-2+p16+) was higher within invasive carcinoma in comparison to DCIS and T1mic and was rising gradually with severity of the diagnosis.  Conclusions:  The data support  different expression pattern of COX-2 and p16 markers in in situ lesions according to surrounding tumors. Further examinations on larger cohorts are needed. This might help to understand different character and behaviour of in situ lesions.","title":"COX2, p16, and Ki67 expression in DCIS, microinvasive and early invasive breast carcinoma with extensive intraductal component.","pubmedId":"ASCO_132131-144"}
