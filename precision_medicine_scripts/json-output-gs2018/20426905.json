Adjuvant chemotherapy provides low rates of clinical benefit as well. We retrospectively analyzed prognostic factors of patients with completely resected stage II NSCLC to find patients with unfavorable factors for proper management.\nClinical data of 220 patients with complete resections of stage II NSCLC at the Sun Yat sen University Cancer Center between January 1998 and December 2004 were retrospectively analyzed. Cumulative survival was analyzed by the Kaplan Meier method and compared by log rank test. Prognosis was analyzed by the Cox proportional hazards model.\nThe overall 3 and 5 year survival rates were 58.8% and 47.9%, respectively. The 3 and 5 year disease free survival rates were 45.8% and 37.0%, respectively. Of the 220 patients, 86 (39.1%) had recurrence or metastasis. A univariate analysis demonstrated that age (\u003e 55 years), blood type, the presence of symptoms, chest pain, tumor volume (\u003e 20 cm3), total number of removed lymph nodes (\u003e or \u003d 10), number of involved N1 lymph nodes (\u003e or \u003d3 ), total number of removed N2 lymph nodes (\u003e 6), and the ratio of involved N1 lymph nodes (\u003e or \u003d 35%) were significant prognostic factors for 5 year survival. In the multivariate analysis, age (\u003e 55 years), chest pain, tumor volume (\u003e 20 cm3), total number of removed lymph nodes (\u003e or \u003d 10), and number of involved N1 lymph nodes (\u003e or \u003d 3) were independent prognostic factors for 5 year survival.\nFor patients with completely resectable stage II NSCLC, having \u003e 55 years, presenting chest pain, tumor volumes \u003e 20 cm3, and \u003e or \u003d 3 involved N1 lymph nodes were adverse prognostic factors, and \u003e or \u003d 10 removed lymph nodes was a favorable one. Patients with poor prognoses might be treated by individual adjuvant therapy for better survival.","title":"Survival analysis of 220 patients with completely resected stage-II non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"20426905"}
