In particular, it is widely used for monitoring of patients with total or near-total thyroidectomy. On the other hand, medullary thyroid caricima has a very sensitive and specific tumor marker, calcitonin. In inherited medullary carcinoma (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2), RET protooncogene analysis is the best for detecting early medullary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"[Thyroid carcinoma].","pubmedId":"15853229"}
