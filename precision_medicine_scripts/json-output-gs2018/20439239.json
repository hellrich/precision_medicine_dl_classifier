She initially had undergone assessment 6 years previously, at which time an intact parathyroid hormone level was 89 pg/mL (reference range, 10 to 69) and the serum calcium concentration was 10.4 mg/dL (reference range, 8.2 to 10.2) in conjunction with normal alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Subsequently, she was found to have multifocal papillary thyroid cancer in the right thyroid lobe and a 5-cm parathyroid carcinoma in the left side.\nSynchronous parathyroid and thyroid carcinomas are extremely rare. To our knowledge, our current case is the first documented patient with parathyroid carcinoma who had a clinical presentation consistent with longstanding mild adenoma in addition to synchronous papillary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"Unusual manifestation of parathyroid carcinoma in the setting of papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"20439239"}
