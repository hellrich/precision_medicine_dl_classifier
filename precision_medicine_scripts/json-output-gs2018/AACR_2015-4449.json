Besides the mutation of Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or beta-catenin which causes the continuous activation of Wnt signaling by stabilizing beta-catenin, there are mutations of other genes such as RNF43 that regulate Wnt signaling at the level of the ligand or cell surface receptor. Inhibition of the secretion of all human Wnts by blocking their palmitoleoylation by the O-acyltransferase, Porcupine (PORCN), could be an alternative therapeutic approach. Here we have developed a compound with a novel pharmacophore that can inhibit PORCN activity and hence Wnt signaling in nanomolar concentration. In vivo efficacy study demonstrated that the compound is highly efficacious in preventing tumor growth in genetic modification model MMTV-WNT1 mouse. We have identified a subset of pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and mucinous ovarian cancer cell lines that are sensitive to the compound. Most of these cell lines harbor mutations in RNF43. Xenograft tumor models derived from the cancer cell lines were found to be sensitive to the compound. Our results demonstrate that inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by targeting PORCN with small-molecule inhibitors in a subset of cancers with mutation in RNF43 is a feasible and nontoxic strategy to overcome the problem of redundancy of Wnts, thereby, providing new option for therapy in diseases with up regulated Wnt expression.","title":"A novel Porcupine inhibitor is effective in the treatment of cancers with RNF43 mutations","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4449"}
