{"genes":["MDM2","CD45","SYT","DDIT3","MDM2"],"publicationTypes":["2010 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: Several sarcoma subtypes are characterized by well-defined genetic events such as chromosomal translocations or gene amplification. In translocation-associated sarcomas, the presence of the fusion transcript can be detected in peripheral blood by RT-PCR. However, sarcoma cells have never been directly visualized in peripheral blood due to the absence of specific immunocytochemical markers. Methods: We developed a novel method to examine large numbers of peripheral blood cells for the presence of sarcoma-associated genetic changes. Using an IRB-approved biospecimen collection protocol, peripheral blood was collected from 20 patients with translocation-associated sarcomas or well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcomas (WD/DD LS), which are characterized by MDM2 amplification. In this exploratory phase, the analysis was limited to patients with high burden of disease, evidence of disease progression or recurrence. Immuno-FISH was performed using CD45 immunostaining to identify hematopoietic cells and the corresponding FISH probe, either a break-apart probe (SYT, DDIT3) or MDM2 probe to detect amplification. Results: MDM2-amplified cells were detected in a subset of WD/DD LS peripheral blood samples, while translocation-positive cells were detected in samples of synovial sarcoma (using the SYT breakapart probe) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (using the DDIT3 breakapart probe). Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first report of direct visualization of sarcoma cells in peripheral blood using whole-blood FISH analysis. We are currently characterizing these cells morphologically and immunocytochemically. In addition, we are developing tools necessary to perform quantitative analysis of circulating tumor cell frequencies in peripheral blood samples, to begin to establish whether the levels of circulating tumor cells correlate with tumor burden and response to therapy. This method may be applicable to other tumors where defined genetic lesions exist that are amenable to FISH analysis. The goal is to use such genotype-based analysis to explore the phenotypic diversity of circulating tumor cells.","title":"Direct visualization of circulating sarcoma cells by whole-blood fluorescence in situ hybridization.","pubmedId":"ASCO_51789-74"}
