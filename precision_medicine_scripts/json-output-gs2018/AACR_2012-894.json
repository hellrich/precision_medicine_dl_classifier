The resulting fusion proteins often drive proliferation and invasion of tumor cells and thus represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. One such kinase that has been demonstrated to be involved in various genomic rearrangement events in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and cholangiocarcinoma is the ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase (also known as c-ROS and ROS). To date, three different 5 fusion partners for ROS1 have been identified. In this study, we examined the frequency of ROS1 gene rearrangement in a panel of 428 patient-derived NSCLC tumor samples using a break-apart FISH assay. We found that approximately 1.2% of samples were positive. In positive samples, the expression of the fusion gene and the identity of the fusion partner were examined. HCC78 is a NSCLC cell line that has been demonstrated by us and others to express the SLC34A2-ROS1 gene fusion. In order to assess the cellular consequences of ROS1 inhibition, we treated HCC78 cells with two distinct small molecule kinase inhibitors that have activity against ROS1 (crizotinib and TAE684). We found that both drugs inhibited proliferation of HCC78 cells, down-regulated signaling pathways known to control cellular growth and survival, and disrupted normal cell-cycle progression. Finally, we report clinical data from a NSCLC patient with a ROS1 gene rearrangement, as detected by the FISH break-apart assay, who demonstrated tumor shrinkage when treated with crizotinib. This patient\u0027s tumor exhibited a novel ROS1 gene fusion partner. In conclusion, genomic rearrangements involving the ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase are present in a small subset of NSCLC patients, and drugs that target ROS1 may be an effective treatment strategy for these patients.","title":"Targeting ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase gene fusions in non-small cell lung cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-894"}
