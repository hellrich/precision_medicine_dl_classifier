{"keywords":["Cytology","epithelioid sarcoma","immunocytochemical markers"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Fine-needle aspirations (FNA) have played a crucial role in the diagnosis and follow-up of malignancies including sarcomas. However, relatively low specificity in the classification of sarcoma is the main limitation of FNA. Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare tumor of soft tissues. Very few individual case reports describing cytological features of epithelioid sarcoma have been documented in the literature. Here, we describe cytological features of epithelioid sarcoma with immunocytohistological correlation.
