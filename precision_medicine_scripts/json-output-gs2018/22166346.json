Overall, in 2009 over 9,000,000 people were invited to undergo a screening examination (3,547,000, 2,522,000 and 2,994,000, for cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer, respectively). More than 4 million people actually took up the invitation (1,393,000, 1,363,000, and 1,423,000 for cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer, respectively). The screening activities led to the finding of 5,973 breast cancers (36% of annual occurring breast cancers in Italy in the 50-69 year age group), 4 454 CIN2 or more severe cervical lesions, 2,556 colorectal cancers (16% of annual occurring CRC cancer in Italy in the 50-69 year age group), and 13,554 advanced adenomas.","title":"The diffusion of screening programmes in Italy, year 2009.","pubmedId":"22166346"}
