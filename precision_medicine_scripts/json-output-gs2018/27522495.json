It has been well documented that patients with IDH1 mutant (IDH1-mu) GBM have a better outcome compared to patients with IDH1 wild-type (IDH1-WT) GBM. IDH1-mu tumors have been shown to be more commonly located in the frontal lobe, and less likely to be in multiple lobes. It is unclear whether differential location is part of the prognostically favorable profile of these tumors. We performed a case-control study, matching IDH1-mu GBMs to IDH1-WT GBMs that are controlled for age, sex and tumor location. There were 21 IDH1-mu tumors and 21 matched IDH1-WT tumors. Age, sex and tumor location were matched between the two groups. After controlling for the factors described, the IDH1-mu tumors were more likely to be secondary GBM (61.9% secondary vs. 14.3%, p\u003d0.004). There was an insignificant trend towards smaller tumor volume in the IDH1-mu group (28.13±6.56 vs. 41.8±7.33 cm3, p\u003d0.173). Extent of surgical resection was similar in both groups (mean 84.49% vs. 89.89%, p\u003d0.419). There was no survival advantage for IDH1-mu tumors when controlled for location: 25.2months overall survival for IDH1-mu patients and 23.6 for IDH1-WT patients, p\u003d0.794. IDH1 mutation may provide part of its prognostic significance by differential localization of tumor, both making IDH1-mu tumors more amenable to gross total resection and placing these tumors in less eloquent areas, thereby lowering neurological morbidity.","title":"IDH1 mutation may not be prognostically favorable in glioblastoma when controlled for tumor location: A case-control study.","pubmedId":"27522495"}
