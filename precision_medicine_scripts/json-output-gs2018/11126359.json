Although, the majority of thyroid specific translocations involve the growth factor receptor c-RET, variant rearrangements of the receptor for nerve growth factor, NTRK1 have also been described. One such translocation, TRK-T1, forms a fusion protein composed of the carboxyl terminal tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK1 and the amino terminal portion of TPR (Translocated Promoter Region). To determine if TRK-T1 expression can cause thyroid cancer in vivo, we developed transgenic mice that express the human TRK-T1 fusion protein in the thyroid. Immunohistochemical analysis of TRK-T1 transgenic mouse thyroids revealed TRK-T1 staining within the thyroid follicular epithelium. In contrast to nontransgenic littermates, 54% of transgenic mice developed thyroid abnormalities that included follicular hyperplasia and papillary carcinoma. Furthermore, all transgenic mice examined greater than 7 months of age developed thyroid hyperplasia and/or carcinoma. These data support the conclusion that TRK-T1 is oncogenic in vivo and contributes to the neoplastic transformation of the thyroid.","title":"The TRK-T1 fusion protein induces neoplastic transformation of thyroid epithelium.","pubmedId":"11126359"}
