Unfortunately, tumours were not accessible for molecular analysis. To study the mechanism underlying the mixed clinical response, we carried out whole-exome sequencing and targeted longitudinal analysis of cfDNA. This revealed two tumour subclones; one with a KIT mutation that responded to imatinib and a second KIT-wild-type subclone that did not respond to imatinib. Notably, the subclones also responded differently to immunotherapy. However, both subclones responded to carboplatin/paclitaxel, and although the KIT-wild-type subclone progressed after chemotherapy, it responded to subsequent re-administration of paclitaxel.\nWe show that cfDNA can reveal tumour evolution and subclonal responses to therapy even when biopsies are not available.","title":"Distinct subclonal tumour responses to therapy revealed by circulating cell-free DNA.","pubmedId":"27502704"}
