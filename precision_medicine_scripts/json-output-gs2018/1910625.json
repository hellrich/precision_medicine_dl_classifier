Tumor-involved lymph node cells (LNC) were cultured in serum free medium (AIM-V) containing 1,000 U/ml of recombinant interleukin-2. The best expansion and specific cytotoxicity of CTL were achieved in 4 to 6 weeks of culture. The predominant populations in cultured LNC-derived CTL were CD2+, CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD56-, and HLA-DR+ T cells. These data suggested that tumor-involved LNC may provide an alternative source for the generation of tumor-specific CTL in adoptive immunotherapy.","title":"Generation of human autologous melanoma-specific cytotoxic T cells from tumor-involved lymph nodes.","pubmedId":"1910625"}
