Gene therapy includes the transfer of genetic material performed by either viral or non-viral methods and in vivo or ex vivo. For melanoma the following approaches are suggested: vaccination with tumour-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or \u0027naked DNA\u0027, vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with cytokine genes or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T-lymphocytes or transfected tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a crucial role in melanoma.","title":"[Strategies for gene therapy of melanoma].","pubmedId":"7607892"}
