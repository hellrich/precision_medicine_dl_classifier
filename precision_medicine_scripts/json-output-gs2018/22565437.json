The importance of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positivity is well known in the prognosis of primary systemic anaplastic large cell cutaneous lymphomas; however, the same in primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell cutaneous lymphomas is not much clear. Herein we report a 65-year-old male with an 18-month history of minimally pruritic localized nodulo-plaque lesion over lower back. Histology revealed cutaneous large cell lymphoma and immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for CD30, CD3 and ALK. The role of ALK positivity in pcALCL is discussed in this article.","title":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma--is it a new variant?","pubmedId":"22565437"}
