Therefore, finding new drugs to inhibit their immunosuppression activity is necessary. This study tests whether bear bile can affect the immunosuppression activities of HSCs.\nThe mice were gavaged with bear bile for 4 weeks. The expression of HSCs was detected through desmin and ±-smooth muscle antibody immunohistochemistry. HSCs were isolated from these mice liver and then cultured with T cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction for 3 days. Stellate cell surface makers, T-cell apoptosis, regulatory T cells and the ability of T cells to kill hepatocellular carcinoma were determined via flow cytometry. Cytokines were determined by a mouse cytokine array panel and T-cell proliferation was determined through a BrdU kit.\nBear bile decreased HSCs and their surface molecules, and affected cytokine secretion. Interestingly, HSCs from the mice gavaged with bear bile promoted T-cell proliferation, inhibited T-cell apoptosis, decreased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and enhanced the activation of T cells killing hepatocellular carcinoma.\nBear bile can inhibit the immunosuppression activity of HSCs and enhance immune response especial anti-tumor immune response.","title":"Bear bile inhibits the immunosuppression activity of hepatic stellate cells in vivo.","pubmedId":"22683969"}
