Specific treatment may take the form of replacement therapy (exogenous gonadotropins or GnRH) for pituitary or hypothalamic failure, inhibition of prolactin secretion, antimicrobial therapy, or immunosuppressive therapy for demonstrable immunologic infertility. Finally, ejaculatory dysfunction often requires sympathomimetic agents. Alternatively, in the normogonadotropic oligospermic patient, the major form of empiric therapy relies on the enhancement of physiologic hormone levels that influence spermatogenesis. Such \"stimulation\" therapy may be achieved by GnRH analogues, antiestrogens, exogenous gonadotropins, or androgens.","title":"Medical treatment of male infertility.","pubmedId":"3554693"}
