This review presents an overview of specific immunotherapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.\nCurrent literature was reviewed regarding the identification of tumor antigens and the design of T-cell- and antibody-based immunotherapy for prostate cancer. The PubMed database was searched using the key words antibodies, clinical trials, dendritic cells, immunotherapy, prostate cancer, and T cells.\nT cells and antibodies are powerful components of the specific antitumor immune response. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) efficiently destroy tumor cells. CD4+ T cells improve the antigen-presenting capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) and support the stimulation of tumor-reactive CTLs. Monoclonal antibodies exhibit their antitumor effects via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement activation. Consequently, much attention has been given to the identification of tumor antigens that represent attractive targets for specific immunotherapy. Several prostate cancer-related antigens were described and used in clinical trials. Such studies were based on the administration of peptides, proteins, or DNA. Furthermore, men with prostate cancer were vaccinated with peptide-, protein-, or RNA-loaded DCs, which display an extraordinary capacity to induce tumor-reactive T cells. Monoclonal antibodies directed against surface antigens were also used. Clinical trials revealed that immunotherapeutic strategies represent safe and feasible concepts for the induction of immunologic and clinical responses in men with prostate cancer.\nSpecific immunotherapy represents a promising treatment modality for prostate cancer. Further improvement of the current approaches is required and may be achieved by combining T-cell- and antibody-based vaccination strategies with radio-, hormone-, chemo-, or antiangiogenic therapy.","title":"Advances in specific immunotherapy for prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"18061335"}
