The case reported here documents a patient with hereditary trichoepithelioma who presented with a basal cell epithelioma of the medial canthus invading the lower eyelid. The clinical and histologic features of both entities will be discussed, as well as the possibility of malignant transformation of a trichoepithelioma to a basal cell epithelioma.","title":"Trichoepithelioma.","pubmedId":"3703529"}
