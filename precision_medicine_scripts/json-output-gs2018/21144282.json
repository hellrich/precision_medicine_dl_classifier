The aim of this study is to test the expression of HER2 protein in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by tissue microarray, and analyze the relationship between HER2 protein expression and chemotherapeutic response rate and survival.\nUsing tissue microarray, HER2 protein expression was detected in patients with advanced NSCLC by immunohistochemistry.\nTotal 80 patients were enrolled in the study. Only 74 patients could be reviewed for HER2 staining. The response rate to chemotherapy in positive and negative HER2 expression groups was 39.1% and 51.0% respectively (P\u003d0.345). The survival difference was also not significant between the positive and negative HER2 protein expression groups (P\u003d 0.437 ).\nThe combination of tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry represents a highly feasible technique for examination of HER2 protein expression in NSCLC. There is no significant difference in survival between positive and negative HER2 expression groups. The role of HER2 protein in NSCLC should be further studied.","title":"[Tissue microarray analysis of HER2 protein expression in patients with non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"21144282"}
