Among 16 carriers of mutation identical with mutation diagnosed earlier in proband, there were 4 patients with clinically obvious medullary thyroid carcinoma and 12 asymptomatic carriers. In all patients, in whom calcitonin level was increased preoperatively, its normalization was obtained. The paper summarizes these aspects of cooperation between geneticians and physicians in which diagnostic results influence clinical decisions (indication and time of thyroid and lymph nodes surgery and it\u0027s spectrum, range of diagnostic procedures towards pheochromocytoma and parathyroid hyperplasia in relation to the found mutation).","title":"[Consequences of clinical genetic analysis of RET proto-oncogene].","pubmedId":"12182057"}
