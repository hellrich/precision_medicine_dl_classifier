In the present study, serum protein S100 was investigated as a tumour marker for screening for melanoma metastasis in patients attending regular follow-up examinations. During the period from September 1997 to December 1998, serum protein S100 levels were measured by an immunoluminometric assay in 411 consecutive high risk melanoma patients (666 samples) and in 120 control subjects. Melanoma patients with resected primary tumours with a tumour thickness of 1.5 mm or more with resected metastasis were included in the study. Overall, 41 of the 411 patients developed metastasis during the period of observation. According to the distribution of protein S100 levels, the following different cut-off values were examined: 0.08 microg/l (95 percentile of the control group) and 0.13 microg/l (95 percentile of the group of melanoma patients without metastasis). The test efficiency for protein S100 as a diagnostic test for the detection of metastasis was highest for the cut-off value of 0.13 microg/l. In eight of the 41 patients (19.5%), elevation of protein S100 was the first sign of recurrence. Of the 41 patients with metastatic disease, 13 had elevated protein S100, giving a sensitivity of 0.32. The specificity for the detection of metastasis was 0.96. In eight of the 14 patients (57%) who developed distant metastasis, elevated S100 values were the first sign of tumour progression. In conclusion, determination of serum protein S100 levels enables earlier detection of distant metastasis in patients at high risk for metastasis. The impact on survival time needs to be investigated in follow-up studies.","title":"Significance of serum protein S100 levels in screening for melanoma metastasis: does protein S100 enable early detection of melanoma recurrence?","pubmedId":"11095406"}
