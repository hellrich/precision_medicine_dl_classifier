We analyzed optic nerve gliomas of 59 patients (median age, 9 years; range, 3 months-66 years; 33 female, 26 male) using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material in tissue microarrays. Seven patients had the clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were performed for BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A (p16), and NF1. Immunohistochemistry was performed for glial fibrillary acidic protein, phospho-ERK, and mutant IDH1 protein. The BRAF duplication was present in 11 (73%) of 15 evaluable tumors, including 1 NF1 patient (1 of 4 tested; 25%). The single tumor lacking BRAF duplication or NF1 association had histologic features of a ganglioglioma. Conversely, heterozygous PTEN deletions were present in 2 (8%) of 25 evaluable cases, one of which was BRAF duplicated and the other was NF1 associated. CDKN2A and NF1 deletions were absent in all tumors tested. Phospho-ERK immunoreactivity was present in 55 (96%) of 57 tumors and was mostly strong and diffuse (80%). Only 1 case of 53 expressed IDH1. Thus, optic nerve gliomas demonstrated molecular alterations typical of pilocytic astrocytomas, including the universal presence of either BRAF duplication or NF1 association and common mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation but very rare mutant IDH1 expression.","title":"BRAF duplications and MAPK pathway activation are frequent in gliomas of the optic nerve proper.","pubmedId":"22892521"}
