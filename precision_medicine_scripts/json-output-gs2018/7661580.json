Photodynamic therapy (PDT) by combination of porfimer sodium and laser was developed as a new cancer therapy. Tumor selectivity of porfimer sodium are based on the following reasons; 1) high affinity for lipoprotein, especially, low density lipoprotein (LDL), 2) elevation of LDL receptor activity in cancer tissue, and 3) lack or imcompleteness of lymphatic system in cancer tissue. Porfimer sodium is activated by laser irradiation at 630 nm, which can reacts with tissue oxygen to produce highly reactive excited siglet oxygen (1O2). This highly reactive molecule is subsequently capable of killing tumor cells through oxidation of cellular component like mitochondrial enzymes. In addition, this highly reactive intermediate causes destruction of the tumor capillaries, which accelerates tumor cell death. The growth suppression or lethal damage to tumor cells by PDT of porfimer sodium and excimer dye laser were observed in experimental tumor models. In human clinical trials, the rates of complete response (CR) for roentgenographically occult lung cancer, stage I lung cancer, superficial esophageal cancer, superficial gastric cancer and carcinoma in situ or dysplasia of the cervix were 84.8%, 50.0%, 90.0%, 87.5% and 94.4%, respectively. The major side effects were cutaneous symptoms e.g. photosensitivity, pigmentation, increasing GOT, GPT but these symptoms were not severe. PDT using porfimer sodium and excimer dye laser must be clinically useful for the treatment of inoperable early cancer or conservation of organ functions.","title":"[Porfimer sodium (Photofrin-II)].","pubmedId":"7661580"}
