Preclinical and phase I trials have shown the additive or synergistic activity of temozolomide combined with carmustine against solid tumors, including malignant glioma, and the sequence-dependent effects of the combination. Toxicity is lower and the maximum tolerated dose is higher when carmustine is given before temozolomide. Studies also have examined the combination of temozolomide with the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan (CPT-11), an alkaloid derivative of camptothecin that has shown activity against malignant glioma. Temozolomide followed by CPT-11 was more effective than either agent alone. A major issue facing investigators now is determining which of the several schedules of temozolomide and CPT-11 are optimal. Completed and ongoing studies of temozolomide in combination with carmustine, including polifeprosan carmustine implant (Gliadel wafers; Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, NJ), and CPT-11 are described.","title":"Temozolomide in combination with other cytotoxic agents.","pubmedId":"11550136"}
