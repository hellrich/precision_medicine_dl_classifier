Although BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are available, lack of response has been frequently observed. To study the mechanism underlying intrinsic resistance to the mutant BRAF(V600E) selective inhibitor vemurafenib, we established short-term primary cell cultures of human metastatic/recurrent BRAF(V600E)-PTC, intrathyroidal BRAF(V600E)-PTC, and normal thyroid (NT). We also generated an early intervention model of human BRAF(V600E)-PTC orthotopic mouse. We find that metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells elicit paracrine-signaling which trigger migration of pericytes, blood endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells as compared to BRAF(WT)-PTC cells, and show a higher rate of invasion. We further show that vemurafenib therapy significantly suppresses these aberrant functions in non-metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells but lesser in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells as compared to vehicle treatment. These results concur with similar folds of down-regulation of tumor microenvironment-associated pro-metastatic molecules, with no effects in BRAF(WT)-PTC and NT cells. Our early intervention preclinical trial shows that vemurafenib delays tumor growth in the orthotopic BRAF(WT/V600E)-PTC mice. Importantly, we identify high copy number gain of MCL1 (chromosome 1q) and loss of CDKN2A (P16, chromosome 9p) in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells which are associated with resistance to vemurafenib treatment. Critically, we demonstrate that combined vemurafenib therapy with BCL2/MCL1 inhibitor increases metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cell death and ameliorates response to vemurafenib treatment as compared to single agent treatment. In conclusion, short-term PTC and NT cultures offer a predictive model for evaluating therapeutic response in patients with PTC. Our PTC pre-clinical model suggests that combined targeted therapy might be an important therapeutic strategy for metastatic and refractory BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC.","title":"Metastasis-associated MCL1 and P16 copy number alterations dictate resistance to vemurafenib in a BRAFV600E patient-derived papillary thyroid carcinoma preclinical model.","pubmedId":"26636651"}
