We report two women aged 41 and 23 years old with this disease, one with normal thyroid function and the other with hyperthyroidism. It is concluded that diffuse sclerosing papillary thyroid carcinoma must be suspected in patients with rapidly growing goiter with irregular surface or diffuse minute calcifications, specially in the presence of hypo or hyperthyroidism. Fine needle aspiration is a good diagnostic procedure.","title":"[Diffuse sclerosing papillary thyroid carcinoma. Report of two cases].","pubmedId":"9778875"}
