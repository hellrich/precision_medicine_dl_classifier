Lapatinib is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-2. This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of lapatinib, alone and in combination with SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan (CPT-11), in colon and gastric cancer cell lines. Concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of both lapatinib and SN-38 were observed in all colon and gastric cancer cell lines tested but varied significantly between individual cell lines (lapatinib range 0.08-11.7 muM; SN-38 range 3.6-256 nM). Lapatinib potently inhibited the growth of a HER-2 overexpressing gastric cancer cell line and demonstrated moderate activity in gastric and colon cancer cells with detectable HER-2 expression. The combination of lapatinib and SN-38 interacted synergistically to inhibit cell proliferation in all colon and gastric cancer cell lines tested. Cotreatment with lapatinib and SN-38 also resulted in enhanced cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis with subsequent cellular pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrating that lapatinib promoted the increased intracellular accumulation and retention of SN-38 when compared to SN-38 treatment alone. Finally, the combination of lapatinib and CPT-11 demonstrated synergistic antitumor efficacy in the LoVo colon cancer mouse xenograft model with no apparent increase in toxicity compared to CPT-11 monotherapy. These results provide compelling preclinical rationale indicating lapatinib to be a potentially efficacious chemotherapeutic combination partner for irinotecan in the treatment of gastrointestinal carcinomas.","title":"The dual EGFR/HER-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib sensitizes colon and gastric cancer cells to the irinotecan active metabolite SN-38.","pubmedId":"19536776"}
