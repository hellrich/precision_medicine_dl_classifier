However, these structures were also recognized in fibrillary astrocytomas, a mixed glioma and a glioblastoma. These laminations continued or closely related to attenuated processes or cytoplasm of astrocytic tumor cells. In addition, some lamellae contained glial filaments. It is considered that the concentric laminations are derived from attenuated astrocytic processes and have no relationship with myelin.","title":"Ultrastructure of concentric laminations in primary human brain tumors.","pubmedId":"3776477"}
