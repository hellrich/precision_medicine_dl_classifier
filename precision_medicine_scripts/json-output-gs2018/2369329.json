Out of 250 cases, in 8% melanoma is classified as lentigo, in 38.8% as superficially spreading, in 53.2%--as nodular. The distinguishing of various melanoma forms in justified as this is of value for determining the prognosis of life in patients with skin melanoma.","title":"[The morphology of the preinvasive phase of different forms of skin melanomas].","pubmedId":"2369329"}
