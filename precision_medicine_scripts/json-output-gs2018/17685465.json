A significant association was found between low p27(Kip1) protein expression and multifocality, bilaterality, and extrathyroidal extension, in addition to LN metastasis. In 42 cases with LN metastases, 23 harbored the BRAF(V600E) mutation in the metastatic tumor and presented a wider diameter of the largest metastatic area, a higher number of involved LNs, and a higher percentage of metastatic lesions with extracapsular extension of LN (ECE-LN). A significantly lower mean value of p27(Kip1) was observed in LNs harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation and in ECE-LN; an inverse correlation was found between p27(Kip1) and the number of metastatic LNs, as well as the diameter of the largest metastatic area in LN.\nThe authors\u0027 data suggested that BRAF(V600E) mutation and p27(Kip1) down-regulation in cancer cells of PTC \u003cor\u003d1 cm may be factors that facilitate tumor-cell growth and progression once these are seeded in the LNs.","title":"BRAF V600E mutation and p27 kip1 expression in papillary carcinomas of the thyroid \u003cor\u003d1 cm and their paired lymph node metastases.","pubmedId":"17685465"}
