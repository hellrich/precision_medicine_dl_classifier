{"genes":["CDK4","MDM2"],"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Paratesticular sarcoma is rare, but liposarcoma is its most common type. Paratesticular liposarcoma sometimes presents as dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Both high-grade and low-grade dedifferentiation have been reported. Herein, we presented a unique case of a 64-year-old man with low-grade dedifferentiated liposarcoma with prominent myxoid stroma. Well-differentiated liposarcoma components extended along the spermatic cord. The constituent cells of the dedifferentiated component were peculiar in that, they were relatively uniform cells with atypia and did not have pleomorphism to such an extent that it mimicked myxofibrosarcoma. This myxoid component was confidently differentiated from myxoid liposarcoma with the help of immunohistochemical analysis using CDK4 and MDM2. These two markers were also expressed in the well-differentiated component. It could therefore be confirmed that this sarcoma is dedifferentiated liposarcoma but is not mixed-type liposarcoma comprising well-differentiated liposarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma.","title":"Paratesticular dedifferentiated liposarcoma with prominent myxoid stroma: report of a case and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"25986682"}
