MITF is also a lineage- survival oncogene in melanoma and recently, it has been shown that germline mutations in MITF predispose to this malignant disease. In melanoma, MITF has been proposed to act as a rheostat where high levels of MITF contribute to a proliferative phenotype whereas low levels result in a more invasive phenotype. The biological output generated by high or low levels of MITF is well characterized. However, how the activity of MITF is regulated to mediate these effects is less well known. It has been proposed that MITF is phosphorylated upon ligand induced activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c- KIT. C-KIT engages the MAP kinase signaling cascade where ERK2 directly phosphorylates Ser73 of MITF and P90RSK phosphorylates the Ser409 residue of MITF. As a consequence, MITF activity increases and the protein is subjected to ubiquitin dependent degradation.Here, we show for the first time that c-KIT induces phosphorylation of MITF through the survival PI3 kinase- AKT pathway, the P38 stress pathway as well as the well-known MAP kinase-ERK signaling pathway. In addition, we show that the SRC kinase upstream of ERK is essential for c-KIT induced MITF activation. Moreover, we used several c-KIT phosphorylation site mutants to map the specific sites that are involved in the mediating transcription activation potential of MITF. These mutants also show less effects on MITF-mediated proliferation.We have generated phosphorylation specific antibodies against Ser73 and Ser409 of MITF and characterized the phosphorylation pattern of MITF using these reagents. Our results suggest that there is a particular relationship between Ser73 and Ser409 with subsequent effects on function. Based on our findings, we propose that phosphorylation of MITF might act as negative feedback mechanism that keeps MITF activity in check. Our model challenges the current knowledge of MITF modulation and provides insights that may have a profound impact on our understanding of the role of MITF in melanocyte and melanoma biology.","title":"Elucidation of c-KIT- dependent signaling to MITF","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-3093"}
