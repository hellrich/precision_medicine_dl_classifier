Although tumors occurring in PJS patients are known to contain mucin-rich conmponents, mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (mBACs) arising from the PJS background have only rarely been reported. Here we report two mBAC patients with PJS. We further explored the LKB1 gene in these two patients and, in addition, eight sporadic mBAC patients. Methods: Frozen tissue specimens were collected from ten mBAC patients who underwent surgery in our department from 2002 to 2008, and high molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from them and stocked in the bio-bank. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient, and ethical approval was obtained from the IRB. The nucleotide sequence of LKB1 (EX01-09) was determined by genomic PCR-direct sequencing. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was analyzed by high resolution fluorescent microsatellite analysis (HRFMA) using two microsatellite markers that encompass the LKB1 locus, D19S886 and D19S565. Results: Among 11 tumors derived from the 10 patients, 9 distinct LKB1 mutations were found in 7 tumors (4 G:C to A:T transitions; 3 G:C to C:G transversions; 2 single nucleotide insetion/deletion). All of three tumors obtained from the two PJS patients harbored a same sequence alteration. Although LOH was not observed in these tumors, independent sequence alterations were found in two of the three tumors, which may suggest biallelic inactivation of LKB1 in tumors occurred in the PJS patients. Conclusions: The relatively high frequency of LKB1 mutation in mBAC patients may suggest its implication in lung carcinogenesis, at least in mBAC, and its potential as a therapeutic target.LKB1, EGFR and KRAS mutation in mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma  CaseAge/SexPYIPJSLKB1-1LKB1-2LKB1-LOHEGFRKRAS165F20F354L+15 bp del279F0F354LNI355F4463stopNI15 bp del468F0PJSE223LG251DNIG12C 5*43F0PJS60stopG251DNIG12V 661M82**-G12D 776M47-G12D 869M66NI969M42D194HNIPYI, pack-year index; PJS, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome; LOH, loss of heterozygosity; NI, not informative; *, Second lung cancer occured at the age of 44 had only single mutation in LKB1 locus (G251D); **, GG insersion at intron","title":"LKB1 mutations in mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma occurring in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_31224-65"}
