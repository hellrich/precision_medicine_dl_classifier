Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) often develop esophageal carcinomas.\nWe analyzed the expression of DEC1 and histone modifications in HNSCC cell lines. The motility and invasive ability of the HNSCC cell lines were also studied.\nOf 18 cell lines, 12 (66.7%) showed down-regulation of DEC1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H3 K27 trimethylation levels in the DEC1-down-regulated cell lines were greater than that in the DEC1-expressed cell lines. Migration assays showed that the DEC1-down-regulated cell lines tended to be more motile than the DEC1-expressed cell lines.\nDEC1 is down-regulated and tends to contribute to the migration ability of HNSCC cell lines. In addition, H3 K27 trimethylation potentially plays an important role in the regulation of DEC1 expression.","title":"Deleted in Esophageal Cancer 1(DEC1) is down-regulated and contributes to migration in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"20975315"}
