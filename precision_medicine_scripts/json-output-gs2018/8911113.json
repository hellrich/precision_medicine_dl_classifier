We report on 22 melanoma patients, including 5 with reduced performance status (Karnofsky PS \u003c 70), 8 with metastatic ocular melanoma, 6 with brain metastases, and 4 who had pretreatment with interleukin-2. These were treated with a combination regimen of dacarbazine (250 mg/m2, days 1-3), cisplatin (30 mg/m2, days 1-3), interferon-alpha 2a (IFN-alpha, 10 Mio IU/m2 s.c., days 1-5) and IL-2 (i.v., 18 Mio IU/m2 for 6, 12, 24 h, followed by 13.5 Mio IU/m2 in 72 h). In the case of brain metastases radiotherapy was added. No grade IV toxicity occurred and no dose reductions were necessary. 21 patients were evaluable for response. 6 (29%) had disease progression, 5 (24%) had partial response and 10 (48%), had stable disease. Sites of response included skin, lymph nodes, muscle, lung, pleura, liver, pancreas, adrenal gland and brain. The described treatment schedule is safe and active even in patients with metastatic melanoma and poor prognosis.","title":"A phase II study of dacarbazine, cisplatin, interferon-alpha and high-dose interleukin-2 in \u0027poor-risk\u0027 metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"8911113"}
