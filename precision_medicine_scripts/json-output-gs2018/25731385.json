We administered nab-PTX to 31 patients with breast cancer between October 2010 and April 2013. Eighteen patients had progressive, recurring breast cancers and 13 patients had locally advanced operable breast cancers. The treatment schedules were 175 or 260 mg/m² every 3 weeks (q3w). No patient experienced an allergic reaction. Grade 1-3 sensory neuropathies were observed in 20 patients; however, no patient experienced grade 4 neuropathy. In patients with locally advanced, operable breast cancer, 1 patient treated with 175 mg/m² q3w had a partial response (PR), while of the patients treated with 260 mg/m² q3w, 10 patients showed a PR, and 1 patient had stable disease (SD). Of the patients with progressive, recurring breast cancer, 2 patients showed a PR and 4 patients had SD when treated with 175 mg/m² q3w, whereas 1 patient displayed a PR and 1 patient had SD when treated with 260 mg/m² q3w. Our investigation suggests that nab-PTX is well tolerated, even by patients with advanced breast cancer.","title":"[Clinical experience of nab-Paclitaxel treatment in 31 patients with breast cancer].","pubmedId":"25731385"}
