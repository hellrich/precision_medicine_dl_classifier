Among the total 87 patients (103 hips), the male was 71 (86 hips) and the female 16 (17 hips) with the average age of 47 years old. The average course of disease was 1.3 year. The effect was evaluated by the clinical symptoms, the Harris\u0027 scores and the manifestations of radiology before and after operation.\nAll the patients were followed up more than 2 years (average 26 months). The average Harris\u0027 scores increased from preoperation 47.3 to postoperation 74.0. The average rate of excellent and good results was 75.7%. The rate of excellent and good was 88% (22/25) in type I, 78.7% (37/47) in type II and 61.3% (19/31) in type III. No severe complications were observed.\nThree-tunnels core decompression with implantation of bMSCs and DBM not only removal the focus of disease, but also use DBM the induction of bone and autologous hone marrow stem cells to differentiate the functions of the femoral head can be resumed loading structure, eliminate pain,improve joint function. It is an effective method for early femoral head necrosis.","title":"[Three-tunnels core decompression with implantation of bone marrow stromal cells (bMSCs) and decalcified bone matrix (DBM) for the treatment of early femoral head necrosis].","pubmedId":"19105378"}
