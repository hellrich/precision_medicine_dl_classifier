Thus, investigation of mechanisms involved in metastasis is essential to control this tumor. However, the angiogenesis regulators that are biologically relevant for melanoma are still unknown. We have previously reported that high levels of soluble VEGF in metastatic malignant melanoma (MMM) patients may represent a useful biomarker to predict the effect of biochemotherapy in terms of clinical response. In this study, we evaluate whether soluble levels of angiogenin, transforming growth factor-1 and VEGFR-1 and -2 play a role in metastatic malignant melanoma patients and to determine if they have any relationship with clinicopathological parameters. Methods: Using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, angiogenin TGF-1, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 were measured in sera of 70 patients with a fully documented history of metastatic malignant melanoma in comparison with 30 healthy controls. Results: Pretreatment circulating angiogenin, TGF- 1 VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 were detectable, variable in all samples from either melanoma patients or healthy donors Only serum transforming growth factor- 1 levels was significantly higher (p\u003d0.005) in patients compared to healthy controls. No relationship was observed between sex, age or LDH level and all studied parameters. When tumor burden has been taken into consideration, a significant relationship was established between high circulating serum TGF-1 (p\u003d 0.001) levels and tumor burden were found, Similarly, higher serum VEGFR1 levels were correlated with tumor burden (P \u003d 0.02). Conclusions: The presence of high circulating TGF-1 and VEGF-R1 in metastatic malignant melanoma patients may prospectively identify high-risk patients with a worse prognosis. In addition, these two parameters may be promising targets for new therapeutic strategies in this pathology.","title":"Role of circulating angiogenin TGF-1, VEGF-R1, and VEGF-R2 in metastatic malignant melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_35521-65"}
