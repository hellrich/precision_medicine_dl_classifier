A cohort of 215 dysplastic nevi and malignant melanomas was studied by cyanoacrylate skin surface stripping (CSSS) and conventional histology. Presence of atypical melanocytes was found in the stratum corneum in more than 95% of malignant melanomas and was always absent in dysplastic nevi. We conclude that this non-invasive technique is rapid, easy to perform, and inexpensive. Its specificity and sensitivity are high enough to be considered by clinicians as an aid for distinguishing dysplastic nevi from malignant melanomas. We recommend this ancillary technique as a screening procedure though not as a substitute for conservative excisional biopsy, when doubt persists in the diagnosis of atypical pigmented neoplasms.","title":"Cyanoacrylate skin surface stripping: an improved approach for distinguishing dysplastic nevi from malignant melanomas.","pubmedId":"2677068"}
