Uni- and multivariate analysis took into account the following patient- and tumor-associated factors: gender and age, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), neurologic symptoms, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, number of intracranial metastases, previous resection or stereotactic radiosurgery of brain metastases, number of extracranial metastasis sites, and local recurrences as well as regional lymph node metastases at the time of WBRT.\nIn univariate analysis, KPS, LDH, number of intracranial metastases, and neurologic symptoms had a significant influence on overall survival. In multivariate survival analysis, KPS and LDH remained as significant prognostic factors, with hazard ratios of 3.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-6.5) and 2.8 (95% CI 1.6-4.9), respectively. Patients with KPS ≥70 and LDH ≤240 U/L had a median survival of 191 days; patients with KPS ≥70 and LDH \u003e240 U/L, 96 days; patients with KPS \u003c70 and LDH ≤240 U/L, 47 days; and patients with KPS \u003c70 and LDH \u003e240 U/L, only 34 days.\nKarnofsky performance status and serum LDH values indicate whether patients with advanced intra- and extracranial tumor manifestations are candidates for palliative WBRT or best supportive care.","title":"Karnofsky performance status and lactate dehydrogenase predict the benefit of palliative whole-brain irradiation in patients with advanced intra- and extracranial metastases from malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"22901382"}
