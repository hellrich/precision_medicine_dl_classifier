PTEN possesses a carboxyl-terminal Postsynaptic density-95/Dlg-1/ZO-1-binding domain (PDZ-BD) implicated in membrane targeting. Since the physiological function of this domain was unclear, a mouse strain lacking this domain was generated. PtenPDZ/PDZ mice developed normally although the haploinsufficient mice (PtenPDZ/-) were under represented by 50% based on Mendelian ratio of inheritance. PtenPDZ/- mice that survived to adulthood harbored a 8 % increase in brain masses when compared to PTEN heterozygous (Pten+/-) animals. However, PtenPDZ/- mice do not have a greater propensity in neoplastic progression of the prostate, lymph nodes, and endometrium. Independently, the Primary astrocytes from PtenPDZ/PDZ mice displayed marginally greater Akt activation following stimulation by epidermal growth factor although both proliferative and migratory capacities were not altered. Crossing PtenPDZ/PDZ mice with a breast cancer model, MMTV-PyMT; and a glioblastoma model, GFAP-Ha-Ras, resulted in enhanced metastasis and reduced survival, respectively. Overall, these data provide the first demonstration of a physiological relevance of PTEN PDZ-BD in embryonic development, brain size regulation and tumor progression.","title":"Characterization of a mouse line lacking the PDZ-binding domain of PTEN","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1576"}
