To provide a broad picture, children who represent various characteristics were selected: ages 6, 9, and 15 years; two male and one female; two Latino and one Caucasian; two English-speaking and one Spanish; two with acute lymphocytic leukemia and one with acute myelocytic leukemia. Consideration of the disease, procedures, treatment, and normal childhood pain experiences will provide the nurse who cares for these children guidance in knowing why and when pain may occur, which will lead to timely interventions for the pain.","title":"Pain and leukemia: the stories of three children.","pubmedId":"11813136"}
