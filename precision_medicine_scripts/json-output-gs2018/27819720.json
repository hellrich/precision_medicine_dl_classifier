Apoptosis is common during normal spermatogenesis; it plays an important role in controlling the number of germ cells and the disposal of defective stem cells to produce functional sperm. The presence of p53 in primary spermatocytes suggests that it plays a role in the prophase of meiosis. p53 is expressed in the testis in both spermatocytes and spermatogonia. This suggests that the p53 gene (TP53) is important for apoptosis regulation during spermatogenesis, and may be associated with male infertility. The main causes of male infertility are genetic, physical, and pathological abnormalities, intense and prolonged exercise, aging, drug use, and long periods of sexual abstinence. Approximately 20% of male infertility is idiopathic. The Trp53 gene is involved in meiosis in male rats and mice suggesting that the p53 plays a critical role in spermatogenesis. We investigated the association between the TP53 polymorphism in codon 72 and idiopathic male infertility in 208 semen samples: 106 showed abnormal semen analysis results and were from infertile men, and 102 were from fertile individuals (the control group). Changes in Trp53 expression are associated with the main phase regulating meiotic progression with a peak in the pachytene stage, and Trp53-deficient mice exhibit degenerative syndrome (giant cells). The genotypic and allelic frequencies were not significantly different among the groups in this study; the results suggest that the TP53 polymorphism in codon 72 is not associated with the pathogenesis of idiopathic male infertility or failure of spermatogenesis.","title":"Male idiopathic infertility and the TP53 polymorphism in codon 72.","pubmedId":"27819720"}
