Immunohistochemical and molecular data were statistically crossed with clinicopathological features.\nOverall, 29 tumors (60%) expressed CD117, 69% were positive for CD5 and 85% (41 cases) for p63. Neuroendocrine markers stained all six atypical carcinoids and five poorly-differentiated thymic squamous cell carcinomas. Overall, six CD117-positive cases (12.5%) showed c-KIT mutation. No mutation was detected in CD117-negative tumors and carcinoids. All the mutations were found in poorly-differentiated thymic squamous cell carcinomas expressing CD117, CD5, p63 and lacking neuroendocrine markers (6 of 12 cases with these features). Mutations involved exon 11 (four cases: V559A, L576P, Y553N, W557R), exon 9 (E490K) and exon 17 (D820E).\nAll TCs need an immunohistochemical screening with CD117, while c-KIT mutation analysis is mandatory only in CD117-positive cases, particularly when coexpressing CD5 and p63, lacking neuroendocrine differentiation. The finding of c-KIT mutation can predict efficacy with different c-KIT inhibitors.","title":"Activating c-KIT mutations in a subset of thymic carcinoma and response to different c-KIT inhibitors.","pubmedId":"22357254"}
