We aimed to investigate BRAF V600E protein expression in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).\nWe investigated BRAF V600E expression in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded surgical tissue specimens of 20 immunocompetent patients with PCNSL using the mutation-specific monoclonal mouse antibody VE1.\nTen male and 10 female patients with a median age of 60 years (range, 44 to 71 y) at time of operation were included. All cases were qualified as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. None of the investigated cases demonstrated specific immunoreactivity for BRAF V600E mutation.\nOur data provide evidence that the BRAF V600E mutation is not pathobiologically relevant in PCNSL and as a consequence is not a feasible drug target in this tumor type.","title":"Lack of BRAF V600E protein expression in primary central nervous system lymphoma.","pubmedId":"23235345"}
