We found that introns closer to the 3\u0027 ends of genes are preferentially lost, as predicted if introns are lost through gene conversion with a reverse transcriptase product of a spliced mRNA. Adjacent introns tend to be lost in concert, as expected if such events span multiple intron positions. Directly contrary to the expectations of some, introns that do not interrupt codons (phase zero) are more, not less, likely to be lost, an intriguing and previously unappreciated result. Adjacent introns with matching phases are not more likely to be retained, as would be expected if they enjoyed a relative selective advantage. The findings of 3\u0027 and phase zero intron loss biases are in direct contradiction to an extremely recent study of fungi intron evolution. All patterns are less pronounced in the lineage leading to Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that the process of intron loss may be qualitatively different in nematodes. Our results support a reverse transcriptase-mediated model of intron loss.","title":"The pattern of intron loss.","pubmedId":"15642949"}
