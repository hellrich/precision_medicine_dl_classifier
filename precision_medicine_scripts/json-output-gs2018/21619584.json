The usual pattern of metastasis for intra-ocular melanoma is hematogenous. There are few reports of regional spread to the maxillofacial bones. We report an interesting case of a 51 year old female with prior history of right eye melanoma, now presenting with metastasis to the left axilla, which is an extra-regional nodal basin.\nIn female patients presenting with an isolated axillary mass, with a negative breast work up and known prior history of melanoma, the differential diagnosis should include possible metastatic melanoma. Core biopsy will confirm the diagnosis and tailor subsequent management.","title":"Intra-ocular melanoma metastatic to an axillary lymph node: a case report.","pubmedId":"21619584"}
