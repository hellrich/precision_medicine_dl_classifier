In this report, we describe the dissection of the MDM2-binding domain on p53 as well as the p53-binding domain on MDM2. We also demonstrate that the oncoprotein simian virus 40 T antigen binds to the product of cellular oncogene mdm2. We have constructed several N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of p53 and MDM2, expressed them in vitro, and assayed their in vitro association capability. The N-terminal boundary of the p53-binding domain on MDM2 is between amino acids 1 and 58, while the C-terminal boundary is between amino acids 221 and 155. T antigen binds to an overlapping domain on the MDM2 protein. On the other hand, the MDM2-binding domain of p53 is defined by amino acids 1 and 159 at the N terminus. At the C terminus, binding is progressively reduced as amino acids 327 to 145 are deleted. We determined the effect of human MDM2 on the transactivation ability of wild-type human p53 in the Saos-2 osteosarcoma cell line, which does not have any endogenous p53. Human MDM2 inhibited the ability of human p53 to transactivate the promoter with p53-binding sites. Thus, human MDM2 protein, like the murine protein, can inactivate the transactivation ability of human p53. Interestingly, both the transactivation domain and the MDM2-binding domain of p53 are situated near the N terminus. We further show that deletion of the N-terminal 58 amino acids of MDM2, which eliminates p53 binding, also abolishes the capability of inactivating p53-mediated transactivation. This finding suggests a correlation of in vitro p53-MDM2 binding with MDM2\u0027s ability in vivo to interfere with p53-mediated transactivation.","title":"The tumor suppressor p53 and the oncoprotein simian virus 40 T antigen bind to overlapping domains on the MDM2 protein.","pubmedId":"8413278"}
