The current second generation of FDA-approved ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and nilotinib, are more potent inhibitors of BCR-ABL1 kinase in vitro. Originally approved for the treatment of patients who were refractory to or intolerant of imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib are now also FDA approved in the first-line setting. The choice of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ie, standard or high dose imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib) to use for initial therapy in chronic-phase CML (CML-CP) will not always be obvious. Therapy selection will depend on both clinical and molecular factors, which we will discuss in this review.","title":"Moving on up: Second-Line Agents as Initial Treatment for Newly-Diagnosed Patients with Chronic Phase CML.","pubmedId":"21792346"}
