In recent years substantial therapeutic progress has occurred with the development of targeted kinase inhibitors and immunotherapeutics. Targeted therapies often result in rapid clinical benefit however responses are seldom durable. Immune therapies can result in durable disease control but responses may not be immediate. Optimal cancer therapy requires both rapid and durable cancer control and this can likely best be achieved by combining targeted therapies with immunotherapeutics. To achieve this, a detailed understanding of the immune consequences of the various kinase inhibitors, in development, clinical trial and currently used to treat melanoma is required.
