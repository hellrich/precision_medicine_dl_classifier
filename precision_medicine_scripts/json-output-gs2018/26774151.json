However, it remains still unclear whether or not TS is expressed in malignant melanoma. We conducted the clinicopathological study to investigate the prognostic significance of TS expression in cutaneous malignant melanoma. Ninety-nine patients with surgically resected cutaneous malignant melanoma were assessed. Tumor sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for TS, Ki-67, and microvessel density (MVD) determined by CD34. TS was positively expressed in 26% (26 out of 99). The expression of TS was significantly associated with T factor, cell proliferation (Ki-67) and MVD (CD34). By Spearman\u0027s rank test, TS expression was significantly correlated with Ki67 and CD34. By univariate analysis, ulceration, disease stage, TS, Ki-67 and CD34 had a significant relationship with survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed that TS was an independent prognostic factor for poor prognosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma. The positive expression of TS could be a useful marker for predicting poor prognosis in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma, and TS-targeting agents may be worth trying for the treatment of this dismal disease.
