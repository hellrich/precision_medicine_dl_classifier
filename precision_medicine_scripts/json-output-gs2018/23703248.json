We systematically reviewed the evidence for assessment of CDKN2A methylation in colorectal cancer to elucidate this issue.\nPubmed, Embase and ISI web of knowledge were searched to identify eligible studies to evaluate the association of CDKN2A hypermethylation and overall survival and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer patients. Combined hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were pooled using a random-effects model.\nA total of 11 studies encompassing 3440 patients were included in the meta-analysis. CDKN2A hypermethylation had an unfavourable impact on OS of patients with colorectal cancer (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29-2.11). Subgroup analysis indicated that CDKN2A hypermethylation was significantly correlated with OS in Europe (HR 1.49; 95% CI 1.28-1.74) and Asia (HR 3.30; 95% CI 1.68-6.46). Furthermore, there was a significant association between CDKN2A hypermethylation and lymphovascular invasion (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.15-2.47), lymph node metastasis (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.09-2.59) and proximal tumour location (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.34-3.26) of colorectal cancer.\nThis meta-analysis indicated that CDKN2A hypermethylation might be a predictive factor for unfavourable prognosis of colorectal cancer patients.","title":"The prognostic value of CDKN2A hypermethylation in colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"23703248"}
