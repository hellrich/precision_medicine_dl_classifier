We aimed to clarify the prevalence of ROS1 gene rearrangement and investigate the clinical implications of ROS1 gene copy number gain (CNG) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We carried out fluorescent in situ hybridization with ROS1 and centromere enumeration 6 probes and immunohistochemistry for ROS1 protein expression. ROS1 rearrangement was detected in 3 of 375 samples (0.8 %); all of whom were female, never-smokers, and harbored an adenocarcinoma component. ROS1 gene CNG was found in 18 cases (4.8 %). ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 12 vs. 58 months; p \u003d 0.003) and shorter overall survival (OS, 40 vs. 67 months; p \u003c0.001) than the group without CNG. Multivariate analysis confirmed that ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with poorer DFS (hazard ratio [HR]\u003d2.16, 95 % confidence interval [CI] \u003d 1.22-3.81, p \u003d 0.008), and OS ([HR] \u003d 2.53, 95 % [CI] \u003d 1.31-4.89, p \u003d 0.006). ROS1 protein overexpression was observed in 5.0 % (18 out of 357), of which 2 cases harbored ROS1 gene rearrangement. There was no statistically significant correlation between ROS1 gene CNG and protein overexpression. This study demonstrated ROS1 gene rearrangement was detected in 0.8 % of surgically resected NSCLC; and ROS1 gene CNG is an independent poor prognostic factor. This survival analyses may contribute to future studies on the utility of ROS1-targeted therapy for patients.","title":"ROS1 gene rearrangement and copy number gain in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25374304"}
