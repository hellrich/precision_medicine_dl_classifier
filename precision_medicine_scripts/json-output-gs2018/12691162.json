However, extramedullary (EM) relapse is an interesting feature of these cases, especially those treated with ATRA. Recently, we have encountered an EM relapse in the pleura in a case with APL receiving an ATRA containing regimen. This case is reported and the relevant literature is reviewed.","title":"Extramedullary relapse in the pleura in acute promyelocytic leukemia.","pubmedId":"12691162"}
