{"genes":["p53"],"publicationTypes":["2012 AACR Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"There is a large effort in the public domain to systematically perform DNA and RNA sequencing on large numbers of tumor samples. These efforts will bring us to a greater understanding of tumor biology and lead to identification of new tumor drivers. However, these efforts may fall short in allowing us to understand the progression of tumor resistance, relapse and metastasis, factors which make tumors difficult to treat and increase mortality rates. We are currently performing targeted DNA sequencing on 4000 tumor samples. We have selected 1321 genes, 5 GB of the genome to sequence. Genes were selected through a thorough review of the literature, mutation databases and key pathways in tumorigenesis such as growth factor signaling, DNA damage, p53 signaling, cell cycle and apoptosis. Our effort not only includes a diverse panel of breast, colon, ovarian, and kidney tumors but we have also sequenced pancreatic, liver, esophageal, cervix, endometrial, melanoma, CLL, DLBCL and carcinoid tumors. Our dataset also includes approximately 300 matched tumor-metastatic pairs and an additional 550 metastatic samples. Clinical phenotypes, treatment information, gene expression profiling and copy number variation data is available for all samples. To achieve the next level of care for cancer patients we must understand the biology of the tumors we are trying to treat, which are often metastatic and standard of care resistant. We believe that increasing our efforts in targeted DNA sequencing of key tumor and metastatic samples will allow us to achieve these goals.","title":"Targeted exome sequencing to understand tumor progression and identify targeted therapies","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-435"}
