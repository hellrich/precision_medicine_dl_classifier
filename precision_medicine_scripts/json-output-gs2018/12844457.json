It is a compilation of problems that has both biologic and psychosocial components and is multifactorial in etiology. Improved understanding of the structures and substances involved in normal sexual function, as well as age-related changes, helps practitioners proactively evaluate and appropriately manage women with FSD. Addressing FSD in a clinical setting should begin with an open discussion about relational, situational, and psychological issues. Clinicians should emphasize nonpharmacologic and behavioral therapies with the goal of achieving satisfying and pleasurable experiences. The continued quest to understand female sexual function and dysfunction requires more education and research on treatment of underlying medical conditions and use of pharmacologic therapies.","title":"Female sexual dysfunction.","pubmedId":"12844457"}
