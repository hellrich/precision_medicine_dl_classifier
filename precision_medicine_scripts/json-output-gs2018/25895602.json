We detected three BCR-ABL1 clones determined by the presence of the E255V, D276G and F317L mutations. We point out the usefulness of searching for mutated populations that survive tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy and the role of their clonal selection over time in relation to therapeutic intervention.","title":"Emerging BCR/ABL1 Mutations Under Treatment with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Paediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia.","pubmedId":"25895602"}
