The polymorphism of PGC gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the relation between the genetic polymorphism of PGC and gastric cancer was examined.\nFour alleles, 31 0bp (allele 1), 400 bp (allele 2), 450 bp (allele 3), and 480 bp (allele 4) were detected by PCR. The frequency of allele 1 was higher in patients with gastric cancer than that in controls. Genotypes containing homogenous allele 1 were significantly more frequent in patients with gastric cancer than that in controls (0.33, 0.14, chi(2)\u003d3.86, P\u003c0.05). There was no significant difference between the control group of Zhuanghe and the group of gastric cancer kindred. But the frequency of allele 1 was higher in control group of Zhuanghe area than that in control group of Shenyang area and genotypes containing homogenous allele 1 were significantly more frequent in the control group of Zhuanghe area than those in control group of Shenyang area (0.33, 0.14, chi(2)\u003d4.32, P\u003c0.05). In the group of gastric cancer kindred the frequency of allele 1 was significantly higher than that in control group of Shenyang area (0.5164, 0.3571, chi(2)\u003d4.47, P\u003c0.05). Genotypes containing homogenous allele 1 were significantly more frequent in the group of gastric cancer kindred than those in control group of Shenyang area (0.36, 0.14, chi(2)\u003d4.91, P\u003c0.05).\nThese results suggest that there is some relation between pepsinogen C gene polymorphism and gastric cancer, and the person with homogenous allele 1 predisposes to gastric cancer than those with other genotypes. Pepsinogen C gene polymorphism may be used as a genetic marker for a genetic predisposition to gastric cancer. The distribution of pepsinogen C gene polymorphism in Zhuanghe, a high-risk area of gastric cancer, is different from that in Shenyang, a low risk area of gastric cancer.","title":"Association between pepsinogen C gene polymorphism and genetic predisposition to gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"12508350"}
