Clinicians and researchers in developmental biology and genetics recently met to facilitate meaningful crosstalk and to discuss considerable progress made in the clinical treatment and basic biology of NBL. For instance, discoveries in familial NBL have identified genetic aberrations in Phox2b and Alk that predispose to NBL, while advances in epigenetics and MYCN regulation have also offered insight into NBL pathogenesis and future treatment. Moreover, novel therapeutic avenues are also being explored, including targeted immunotherapies, and innovative radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic approaches. This multi-disciplinary meeting was convened to aid the transfer of new biological findings into the clinic and to use clinical advances to inform the basic biological understanding of this devastating disease.","title":"Neuroblastoma progress on many fronts: the Neuroblastoma Research Symposium.","pubmedId":"21922652"}
