Here we found that a nonprotein extract of inflamed rabbit skin inoculated with vaccinia virus (Neurotropin(Â®)) enhanced efficiency of NGF signaling. In rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells overexpressing Trk (PCtrk cells), Neurotropin augmented insufficient neurite outgrowth observed at suboptimal concentration of NGF (2ng/mL) in a manner depending on Trk kinase activity. Cellular exposure to Neurotropin resulted in an accumulation of Trk-GM1 complexes without affecting dimerization or phosphorylation states of Trk. Following NGF stimulation, Neurotropin significantly facilitated the time course of NGF-induced Trk autophosphorylation. These observations provide a unique mechanism controlling efficiency of NGF signaling, and raise the therapeutic potential of Neurotropin for various neurological conditions associated with neurotrophin dysfunction.
