It consist \u003c 5% of all cases of melanoma in females, as the ratio of its manifestation, compared with the cutaneous melanoma is 1:71. Higher risk of developing melanoma of the vulva is established in white women, as the peak of the incidence is between 60 and 70 years of age. Clinically, MM of the vulva manifests as asymptomatic pigmented, rarely a pigmented lesion, as the usual clinical form is superficial spreading MM and much less common nodular MM, which is associated with a poorer prognosis in. general. The diagnosis is confirmed by histological examination. Conduction of PCR and DNA analysis for detection of BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations and KIT amplification is also appropriate. Advanced age, black race, tumor size, tumor thickness, ulceration, presence of satellite lesions, involvement of adjacent organs (vagina, urethra), and the presence of regional or distant metastases are identified as the most important prognostic markers. Radical wide excision followed by bilateral lymphadenectomy id considered as the optimal therapeutic approach.","title":"[Vulvar melanoma].","pubmedId":"25909143"}
