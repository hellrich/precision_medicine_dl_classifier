Patients with AML-MK presented at an older age, with lower bone marrow blasts, and their blasts less frequently expressed CD34. Most patients with AML-MK had morphologic multilineage dysplasia and were predominantly subclassified as having AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). Molecular analysis showed a significant absence of NPM1 and FLT3 in patients with AML-MK.\nOutcome data showed that patients with AML-MK had significantly worse overall survival, disease-free survival, and complete response compared with the rest of the patients with AML as well as within the AML-MRC group.","title":"Acute myeloid leukemia with monosomal karyotype: morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular findings.","pubmedId":"25015859"}
