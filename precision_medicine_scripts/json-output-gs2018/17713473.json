Of 175 consecutive patients treated with oral gefitinib (250 mg/day), 170 (median age: 67 years; 72% men) were evaluable for genotyping and survival. Fifty-five patients (33%) had stable disease and 17 (10%) had an objective response. The most common of four haplotypes was G-C (EGFR*1) at the EGFR -216G\u003eT and -191C\u003eA loci (frequency, 0.45). After adjusting for performance status, previous platinum-containing chemotherapy and occurrence of skin rash or diarrhea during the first treatment cycle in patients with performance status 0 or 1 (N\u003d139), the absence of EGFR*1 was associated with significantly better survival (hazard ratio: 0.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.91; P\u003d0.015). The results may help identify patients with NSCLC who can benefit from gefitinib treatment.","title":"Germline polymorphisms in EGFR and survival in patients with lung cancer receiving gefitinib.","pubmedId":"17713473"}
