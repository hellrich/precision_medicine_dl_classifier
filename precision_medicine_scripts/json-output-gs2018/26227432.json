A multivariate prognostic model was developed using the Cox regression model fitted to the data of 113 consecutive metastatic patients treated with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg, q3w) at Veneto Institute of Oncology (IOV). External validation was obtained using the data of 69 and 34 patients treated at European Oncology Institute (IEO) and University of Torino (UT), respectively.\nMedian survival was 8.3, 4.9 and 7.1 months from first ipilimumab administration at IOV, IEO and UT, respectively. Both higher baseline levels of LDH (Hazard Ratio [HR] v\u003d1.36, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.16-1.58, P\u003c.001) and neutrophils (HR\u003d1.76, 95% CI 1.41-2.10, P\u003c.001) were associated with worse prognosis. Model performance was satisfactory both upon internal validation (Dxy\u003d0.42) and external validation (Dxy\u003d0.40). Serum LDH and neutrophil count discriminated patients who lived more (low neutrophils and low LDH) or less (high LDH or neutrophils) than 24 months.\nSerum LDH and neutrophil count were significant independent prognostic factors. This externally validated prognostic nomogram, could help clinicians to identify the patients who would benefit most from ipilimumab and consequently to improve resource allocation. These easily available biomarkers deserve further validation.","title":"Personalised medicine: Development and external validation of a prognostic model for metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab.","pubmedId":"26227432"}
