Expression levels of thymidylate synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, excision repair cross-complementing gene 1 , glutathione S-transferase Pi, epidermal growth factor receptor, and HER2 were measured in matched preradiochemotherapy endoscopic tumor biopsies and in postradiochemotherapy resection specimens. mRNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, laser microdissected tumor tissues, and a quantitative fluorescent dye real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction system was used for gene expression measurement.\nThere was a significant reduction in the expression levels of thymidylate synthase (p \u003c 0.01), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (p \u003d 0.03), excision repair cross-complementing gene 1 (p \u003c 0.01), glutathione S-transferase Pi (p \u003d 0.03), HER2 (p \u003c 0.01), and epidermal growth factor receptor (p \u003d 0.04). The change in the levels of epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA in post- compared with pretreatment specimens was significantly associated with the histopathologic grade of regression (p \u003d 0.01).\nThe expression levels of a set of genes that are possible determinants of 5-FU/cisplatin/radiation therapy antitumor activity are significantly downregulated by neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in esophageal cancer.","title":"Downregulation of TS, DPD, ERCC1, GST-Pi, EGFR, and HER2 gene expression after neoadjuvant three-modality treatment in patients with esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"15737843"}
