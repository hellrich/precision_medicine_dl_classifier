Several studies conducted in the People\u0027s Republic of China have characterized the unique molecular epidemiology of familial colorectal cancer syndromes and molecular biomarkers such as microsatellite instability and genetic mutations (eg, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, ERCC1) in Chinese populations. Interethnic differences in anticancer drug response and toxicity have been well described in many cancers, and this review examined the literature with regard to the tolerance of Chinese patients to commonly used chemotherapeutic regimens and targeted therapies for metastatic colorectal cancer. Studies on the pharmacogenomic differences in drug metabolizing and DNA repair enzymes between Chinese, North Asians, and Caucasian patients were also reviewed.
