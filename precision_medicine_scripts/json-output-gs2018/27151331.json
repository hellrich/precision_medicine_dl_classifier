The utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect NRAS(Q61L) mutations is currently unknown. This study sought to assess the sensitivity and specificity of anti-BRAF(V600E) (VE1), anti-NRAS(Q61R) (SP174) and anti-NRAS(Q61L) (26193) antibodies for mutation detection in a large series of cases.\nMutation status was determined using the OncoCarta assay in 754 cutaneous melanomas. IHC with the anti-BRAF(V600E) antibody was performed in all cases, and the anti-NRAS(Q61R) and anti-NRAS(Q61L) antibodies were assessed in a subset of 302 samples utilizing tissue microarrays. The staining with the anti-BRAF(V600E) and anti-NRAS(Q61R) antibodies was diffuse, homogeneous and cytoplasmic. The anti-NRAS(Q61L) antibody displayed variable intensity staining, ranging from weak to strong in NRAS(Q61L) mutant tumours. The sensitivity and specificity for anti-BRAF(V600E) was 100 and 99.3%, anti-NRAS(Q61R) was 100 and 100% and anti-NRAS(Q61L) was 82.6 and 96.2%, respectively.\nThe use of IHC is a fast, efficient and cost-effective method to identify single specific mutations in melanoma patients. BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61R) antibodies have high sensitivity and specificity; however, the NRAS(Q61L) antibody appears less sensitive. IHC can help to facilitate the timely, appropriate selection and treatment of metastatic melanoma patients with targeted therapies. Detection of melanoma-associated mutations by IHC may also provide evidence for a diagnosis of melanoma in metastatic undifferentiated neoplasms lacking expression of melanoma antigens.","title":"BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61L/Q61R) mutation analysis in metastatic melanoma using immunohistochemistry: a study of 754 cases highlighting potential pitfalls and guidelines for interpretation and reporting.","pubmedId":"27151331"}
