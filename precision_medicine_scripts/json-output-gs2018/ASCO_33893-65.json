Methods: 41 patients with primary cholangiocarcinoma (CCC) were repeatedly treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in 4-week intervals. In total, 291 TACE sessions were performed with a mean of 7.1 sessions per patient (mean age: 57.1 years; range, 37-80 years). 22 patients had multiple tumors, 6 showed 1 lesion, 5 had 2 lesions and 8 presented 3 to 4 lesions. The local chemotherapy protocol consisted of Mitomycin C alone (n\u003d20), or in combination with gemcitabine (n\u003d18). Embolization was performed with lipiodol and starch microspheres for vessel occlusion. Tumor response was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 3-month intervals. Results: Evaluation of local tumor control according to the RECIST criteria was as follows: partial response 9.8%, stable disease 43.6%, and progressive disease 46.6%. The 1-year survival rate after TACE was 58%, the 2-year survival rate was 21%. The mean survival time from the date of diagnosis of liver involvement was 34.1 months (according to Kaplan-Meier), after first TACE treatment 16.7 months. The median survival time of the palliative group was 14.5 months and of the symptomatic group 6 months. Conclusions: Our data indicated that repeated TACE using the protocols is well tolerated and yields respectable results in patients with unresectable liver lesions from CCC.","title":"Repeated transarterial chemoperfusion and -embolization (TACE) in primary hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCC): Local tumor control and survival rate.","pubmedId":"ASCO_33893-65"}
