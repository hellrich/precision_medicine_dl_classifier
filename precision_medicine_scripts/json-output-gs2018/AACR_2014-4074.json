Also, it is known that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) promotes tumorigenesis as an immunosuppressive cytokine and is crucial for the development of Th17. In this study, we investigated the role of CD40 on breast cancer cells and its role on the immune suppressive function and tumor progression. CD40 stimulation on breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB231, caused up-regulation of TGF-, and direct CD40-CD40L interaction between breast cancer cells and activated T cells increased TFG- production. Moreover, direct interaction of CD40-CD40L induced the production of IL-17, which increased the proliferation of MDA-MB231 cells via the activation of STAT3. Therefore, direct CD40-CD40L interaction of breast tumor and activated T cells increases the TGF- production and the differentiation of Th17 cells, which promote the proliferation of breast cancer cells.","title":"Direct interaction of CD40 on tumor cell with CD40L on T cells increases the proliferation of tumor cells via the enhancement of TGF-b production and Th17 differentiation","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4074"}
