The scarcity of validated model systems has hampered research efforts. Due to infrequency, large scale studies of novel therapeutics are not routinely feasible. We report the establishment and propagation of an ACC patient derived xenograft (PDX), genomic evaluation of mutations, and in vivo response profiles to personalized chemotherapy agents based on next-generation sequencing. Methods: An ACC PDX was established and maintained in NSG mice directly from the operating room. Common cancer-associated mutations were identified using the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon Cancer panel. PDXs were treated with focal radiation or chemotherapy selected based on the genomic profile of the cancer. Tumor size was measured over time. Target inhibition was confirmed in vivo via tumor lysates. Results: This ACC PDX maintains the histologic and physical characteristics of the primary human tumor. Mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinases(RTKs) cKit and KDR/VEGFR2 were identified. No mutations were identified in EGFR, RAS, or PIK3CA. Several targeted therapies were selected including dovitinib, a multi-RTK inhibitor, BEZ235, a PI3K/mTORC inhibitor, and cetuximab, an EGFR mAB. Target inhibition was confirmed by western blot of tumor lysates. Treatment with several molecular agents resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition: time to tumor doubling was 17 d in CTRL, 33 d in dovitinib, 39 d in BEZ235, and 46 d in cetuximab treated tumors. Radiation (5 Gy x 8 fractions) potently arrested tumor growth (doubling time \u003e 70 d). Work is ongoing to identify the role of the specific cKIT and KDR mutations. Conclusions: PDXs are a valuable model system for investigating potential proof of concept for personalized approaches to cancer care. These preliminary data identify the rationale to investigate selected molecularly targeted drugs for ACC, particularly when driven by tumor specific genetic biomarkers. Expansion of these studies may be valuable to advance the design of new treatment strategies for ACC.","title":"Patient derived adenoid cystic carcinoma xenografts to examine personalized cancer treatment approaches.","pubmedId":"ASCO_171520-176"}
