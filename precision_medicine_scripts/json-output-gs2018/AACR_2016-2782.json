DNA methylation in the long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) is a good indicator of the global DNA methylation level. In previous studies, we demonstrated that LINE-1 hypomethylation was strongly associated with a poor prognosis in some types of cancers including esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, supporting its potential role as a prognostic marker. However, the relationship between LINE-1 hypomethylation and clinical outcome in pancreatic cancer remains unclear.Methods: LINE-1 methylation level in 126 samples resected pancreatic cancers was measured by pyrosequencing assay, and the prognostic value of LINE-1 methylation level in pancreatic cancer was examined.Results: Pancreatic cancers showed significantly lower LINE-1 methylation levels compared to matched non tumorous parenchyma (P \u003d 0.039; N \u003d 36). Tumoral LINE-1 methylation range was 41.3-92.8 (N \u003d 126; mean: 77.7; median: 78.5; standard deviation: 5.7). However, LINE-1 hypomethylation was not significantly associated with overall survival, cancer specific survival, disease-free survival [log-rank p \u003d 0.30, p \u003d 0.18 and p \u003d 0.50, respectively].Conclusion: The present result suggested that LINE-1 hypomethylation in pancreatic cancer is not associated with poor prognosis. In this study, our cohort was small, therefore further accumulation of data may be needed in order to confirm the effect of LINE-1 methylation level on survival in pancreatic cancer.","title":"The effect of LINE-1 methylation level on survival in pancreatic cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2782"}
