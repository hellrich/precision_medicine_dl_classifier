The contemporary technique using fresh tissue has enabled the application of Mohs surgery to the treatment of malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract. Mohs surgery, once limited to large recurrent basal cell carcinomas, has expanded to include several cutaneous and noncutaneous neoplasms. With better understanding of the Mohs technique, its indications, applications, and advantages, an interdisciplinary approach to manage certain head and neck neoplasms is proposed.","title":"Complete microscopic controlled surgery for head and neck cancer.","pubmedId":"6724958"}
