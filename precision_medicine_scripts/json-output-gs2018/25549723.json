Absence of radioiodine uptake on iodine-131 whole body scan obtained within 14 months of study entry was required. Each patient received dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) for 25 days before thyrotropin Î±-stimulated iodine-131 whole body scan (4 mCi/148 MBq). Patients whose scan showed new sites of radioiodine uptake remained on dabrafenib for 17 more days, and then were treated with 150 mCi (5.5 GBq) iodine-131. The primary endpoint of the study was the percentage of patients with new radioiodine uptake after treatment with dabrafenib.\nSix of 10 patients (60%) demonstrated new radioiodine uptake on whole body scan after treatment with dabrafenib. All 6 were treated with 5.5 GBq iodine-131. Two patients had partial responses and 4 patients had stable disease on standard radiographic restaging at 3 months. Thyroglobulin decreased in 4 of 6 treated patients. One patient developed squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. There were no other significant adverse events attributed to dabrafenib.\nDabrafenib can stimulate radioiodine uptake in patients with metastatic BRAF V600E-mutant iodine-refractory PTC, representing a potential new therapeutic approach for these patients.","title":"Redifferentiation of iodine-refractory BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic papillary thyroid cancer with dabrafenib.","pubmedId":"25549723"}
