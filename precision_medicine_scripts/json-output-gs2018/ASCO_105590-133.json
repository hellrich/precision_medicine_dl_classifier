Pre-clinically, HH inhibitors have demonstrated a reduction in GE tumor growth, cell motility and invasiveness. V, an oral small-molecule antagonist of the Hh pathway, has previously been safely combined with FOLFOX chemotherapy.  Methods:  Pts with untreated, metastatic or locally advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma were randomized 1:1, stratified by institution and disease status (with or w/o distant mets) to FOLFOX (ox 85 mg/m2, LV 200 mg/m2, 5-FU bolus 400 mg/m2, 5-FU infusion 2400 mg/ m2 over 48 hrs) q14d plus V or placebo (P) (150mg PO daily). Cycle defined as 2 weeks and no crossover allowed at progression.  FFPET and blood were collected for biomarker analyses.  Response assessed every 8 weeks (RECIST 1.1). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), secondary objectives were overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), and toxicity.  Results:   124 pts (V/P 60/64) enrolled at 20 sites between 10/09-2/12.  Pt characteristics (V/P): median age 58/62; ECOG PS 0: 23 (40%) / 30 (47%); male 39 (65%) / 53 (83%); GEJ 37 (62%) / 39 (61%); diffuse histology 20 (43%) / 14 (30%). Median number of FOLFOX cycles 9.5/11. Most common Gr 3 toxicities: (% pts V/P) neutropenia 50.0/31.7 (p\u003d0.07), neuropathy 23.1/14.3 (p\u003d0.33), fatigue 15.4/9.5 (p\u003d0.50), thrombosis 13.5/11.1 (p\u003d0.92), anemia 9.6/9.5 (p\u003d0.99), hypokalemia 9.6/4.8 (p\u003d0.52), nausea 7.7/9.5 (p\u003d0.99). Death on or within 30 days of treatment 6.7%/15.6% (p\u003d0.20). Median PFS in ITT population 11.5/9.3 mo (95% CI 8.5-14.4/6.7-11.9; p\u003d0.34) and median OS 12.2/13.9 mo (95% CI 10.2-14.3/11.5-16.3; p\u003d0.48).  Non-statistically significant trends toward improved PFS with V were noted in female pts, diffuse histology, and PS 1 (p 0.08). RR (%) 33/27 (p\u003d0.64).  Conclusions:  Addition of V to FOLFOX did not improve PFS in an unselected advanced GE carcinoma population. Blood and tissue biomarker analyses are ongoing to determine if there is a subset of patients who may derive benefit from V.
