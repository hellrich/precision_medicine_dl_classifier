It would be of interest to examine whether the different kappa-opioid receptor subtype properties of TRK-820 participate in its antinociceptive action in the inflamed paw test and the formalin test. TRK-820 produced a potent antinociceptive effect, which was inhibited by the selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine, but not by the mu-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone in the mechanical paw pressure test. TRK-820 also produced a potent antinociceptive effect in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis. TRK-820 and morphine, a prototype mu-opioid receptor agonist, were equally effective in inhibiting the nociceptive responses in the arthritic rats and in the normal rats, while ICI-199441, 2-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)ethyl]- acetamide, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, was about 5-fold less potent in the arthritic rats than in the normal rats. In the formalin test TRK-820 had a very similar antinociceptive potency to that of ICI-199441, unlike in the arthritic rats in which TRK-820 was 2.5 times more potent than ICI-199441. It is concluded that TRK-820 produced a potent antinociceptive action via the stimulation of kappa-opioid receptors in rats. TRK-820 has a unique antinociceptive profile different from that of the other kappa-opioid receptor agonists such as ICI-199441 in arthritic rats.","title":"Characterization of the antinociceptive effects of TRK-820 in the rat.","pubmedId":"10650153"}
