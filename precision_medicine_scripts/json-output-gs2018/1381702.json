The w locus encodes the c-kit tyrosine-kinase receptor whose ligand is the product of the SI locus. Using monoclonal antibodies (MAb(s)) to the extracellular domain, we have evaluated the expression of c-kit in normal and transformed melanocytes. This cell lineage synthesizes a receptor with a mw of 145 kDa. The gene product is expressed in epidermal melanocytes and in a fraction of nevocytic and blue nevi. In primary melanomas, loss of the receptor is observed in more invasive lesions. Only 30% of the metastatic lesions express detectable levels of the receptor. These findings demonstrate that the c-kit product is down-regulated in melanocytes following malignant transformation. The functional relevance of this modulation remains to be evaluated.","title":"Progression of human cutaneous melanoma is associated with loss of expression of c-kit proto-oncogene receptor.","pubmedId":"1381702"}
