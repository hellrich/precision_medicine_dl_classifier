Large-scale mutation profiling efforts in de novo myelodysplastic syndromes have identified mutations that correlate with clinical features, but such mutations have not been investigated in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myelogenous leukemia. Genomic DNA from 38 patient samples were subjected to high throughput polymerase chain reaction and sequenced for TP53, TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, IDH1, IDH2, EZH2, EED, SUZ12, RBBP4, SRSF2, U2AF35, and SF3B1. We identified somatic mutations in 16 of 38 (42%) patients. TP53 mutations were the most common lesion, detected in 8 of 38 (21%) patients, followed by TET2 in 4 of 38 (10.5%). Cases with a TP53 mutation or loss of the TP53 locus had a worse overall survival compared to those with wild-type TP53 (8.8 vs. 37.4 months; P\u003d0.0035).","title":"Mutational analysis of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myelogenous leukemia.","pubmedId":"23349305"}
