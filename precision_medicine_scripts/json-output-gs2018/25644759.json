Neurotensin (NTS) and its high affinity receptor (NTSR1) overexpression induces neoplastic growth and predicts the poor prognosis in various malignancies. Whether NTS can promote the glioma progression and its prognostic significance for glioma patients remains unclear.\nNTS precursor (ProNTS), NTS and NTSR1 expression levels in glioma were detected by immunobloting Elisa and immunohistochemistry assay. The prognostic analysis was conducted from internet by R2 microarray platform. Glioma cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK8 and BrdU incorporation assay. Wound healing model and Matrigel transwell assay were utilized to test cellular migration and invasion. The orthotopic glioma implantations were established to analyze the role of NTS and NTSR1 in glioma progression in vivo.\nPositive correlations were shown between the expression levels of NTS and NTSR1 with the pathological grade of gliomas. The high expression levels of NTS and NTSR1 indicate a worse prognosis in glioma patients. The proliferation and invasiveness of glioma cells could be enhanced by NTS stimulation and impaired by the inhibition of NTSR1. NTS stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in glioma cells, which could be reversed by SR48692 or NTSR1-siRNA. In vivo experiments showed that SR48692 significantly prolonged the survival length of glioma-bearing mice and inhibited glioma cell invasiveness.\nNTS promotes the proliferation and invasion of glioma via the activation of NTSR1. High expression levels of NTS and NTSR1 predict a poor prognosis in glioma patients.","title":"Neurotensin promotes the progression of malignant glioma through NTSR1 and impacts the prognosis of glioma patients.","pubmedId":"25644759"}
