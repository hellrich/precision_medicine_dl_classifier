In this study, we investigated the role of miR-146b in the Toll-like receptor-4 signaling pathway and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NASH in vivo and in vitro.\nThe effect of miR-146b on the expression of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in RAW264.7 cells and HepG2 was studied, and the effect of miR-146b on lipid accumulation in HepG2 was also studied in vitro. The levels of IRAK1, TRAF6, NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the histologic features and lipid accumulation in the livers of HFD-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and an miR-146b-administered HFD mouse model, were studied in vivo.\nAfter miR-146b administration, TRAF6 and IRAK1 mRNA and protein levels in macrophages after lipopolysaccharide administration and in HepG2 cells after oleic acid (OA) administration were significantly decreased in 146b group compared with control group (P \u003c 0.001). The lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells exposed to OA was also decreased by inactivation of IRAK1 and TRAF6, then downregulation of the downstream molecules (NF-κB) and upregulation of the tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) level. In vivo, after administration of miR-146b, TRAF6 and IRAK1 mRNA and protein levels as well as TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein levels were decreased, and hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the 146b group had low average adipose cell cross-sectional areas compared with control group.\nMiR-146b ameliorated HFD-induced NASH by directly suppressing IRAK1 and TRAF6.","title":"MiR-146b attenuates high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.","pubmedId":"25559563"}
