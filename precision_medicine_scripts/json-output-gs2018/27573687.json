Our objective was to assess the prognostic value of the updated 2016 WHO classification in the French POLA cohort. All cases of high-grade oligodendroglial tumors sent for central pathological review and included into the French nationwide POLA cohort were reclassified according to the updated 4th WHO classification. In total, 1041 patients were included, with a median age at diagnosis of 50.4 years (range 17.1-84.4). Based on the new histomolecular classification, diagnoses included anaplastic oligodendroglioma IDH mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted (32.5 %), anaplastic astrocytoma IDH mutant (IDH (mut)) (11.0 %), anaplastic astrocytoma IDH wild type (IDH (wt)) (5.3 %), glioblastoma IDH (mut) (17.1 %), and glioblastoma IDH (wt) (33.2 %). Ten patients presented with a diffuse midline tumor, H3 K27M mutant. The new WHO classification was prognostic for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (p \u003c 0.001). We did not find prognosis differences between grades III and IV for IDH (mut) 1p/19q intact and IDH (wt) gliomas in univariate and multivariate analyses. Among anaplastic astrocytoma IDH (wt), cases with chromosome arm 7p gain and 10q loss (55 %) had shorter PFS than the others (p \u003d 0.027). In conclusion, the new WHO histomolecular classification of diffuse gliomas presented with high prognostic value. Grading was not discriminant between grade III and IV high-grade gliomas.
