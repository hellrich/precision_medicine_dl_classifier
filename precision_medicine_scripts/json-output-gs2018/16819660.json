The overall rate of mucosal melanoma is rare and malignant melanomas developing from turbinates or maxillary sinuses are extremely rare. Symptoms of nasal melanoma are generally nonspecific, and patients often fail to seek prompt medical attention. Diagnosis can be confirmed by the immunochemical profile of staining with anti-S100 and HMB-45 antibodies, even in the case of melanin-free pigment melanoma. The present study reports two cases of primary malignant melanoma in the turbinate and maxillary sinus.","title":"Two cases of malignant melanoma in turbinate and maxillary sinus.","pubmedId":"16819660"}
