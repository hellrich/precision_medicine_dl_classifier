Multiple gastric erosions and ulcers which had healed after 6 weeks, except for one ulcer, were found. A biopsy of this unhealed ulcer revealed gastric carcinoma. Enucleation of the tumor was performed because of multiple metastases to the liver, lung and the lymph nodes. The high serum alpha-fetoprotein level (800 ng/ml) and the size of a coin lesion in an X-ray film of the chest before the enucleation decreased post- operatively.","title":"[Carcinoid tumor of the stomach].","pubmedId":"6876454"}
