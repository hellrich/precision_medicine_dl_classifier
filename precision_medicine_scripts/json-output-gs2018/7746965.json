During the last decade systemically-administrated interferon and interleukin-2 have been used. Advances in immunology and molecular biology could allow a more specific and active immunotherapy. Perspectives include chemo-immunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents, adoptive immunotherapy with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), gene therapy designed to increase tumor immunogenicity, and active immunotherapy with vaccines.","title":"[Immunotherapy of malignant melanoma.
