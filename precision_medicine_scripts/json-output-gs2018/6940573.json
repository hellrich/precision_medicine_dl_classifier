At operation, the device was presenting beneath the serosal surface of the posterior uterine wall. The literature is briefly reviewed.\nThe Grafenberg Ring, one of the earliest forms of IUD, was widely used in the 1920\u0027s but was discontinued after the 1930\u0027s because of controversy regarding its side effects.  This report describes the case of a 71-year old married female, gravida 2, para 1 who presented at the clinic complaining of postmenopausal bleeding over the previous 8 weeks.  In 1939, the patient had an IUD inserted after delivery of her child.  She became pregnant 8 months later and aborted.  The attending gynecologist erroneously assumed that the device had been expelled prior to her second pregnancy.  She was investigated without success.  The general condition of the patient on examination was good.  Because of recurrent postmenopausal bleeding, a hysterectomy was performed and she progressed uneventfully.  The Grafenberg ring, 18 mm in diameter, was recovered at the myometrium during the pathological examination.  There were no significant abnormalities in the uterus and cervix.","title":"Retained Grafenberg ring for 39 years discovered during abdominal hysterectomy.","pubmedId":"6940573"}
