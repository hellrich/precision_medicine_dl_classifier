The patient had hemoptysis for 5 years. Lateral chest X-ray showed an oblique line attaching to the central portion of the right diaphragm. Selective angiography and ultrasonography showed an aberrant vessel originating from the abdominal aorta. At the time of operation, the pleural cavity was divided into two compartments by a fibrous membrane. The bronchus of the lower compartment and the pulmonary veins ran through a hole in the accessory diaphragm. The aberrant artery flowed into the parts of lung in the upper and lower compartments.","title":"[A case of intralobar pulmonary sequestration associated with an accessory diaphragm].","pubmedId":"8230877"}
