The prognostic biomarkers chosen for comparison represented surrogate measures of tumor: (i). proliferation, growth and genetic instability (mitotic and apoptotic indices, Ki-67/MIB-1-positivity, nuclear grade, p53-positivity), (ii). endocrine-dependence (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), pS2, Bcl2), (iii). growth factor receptor-dependence (ErbB2, EGFR/ErbB1), and (iv). angiogenic, invasive and proteolytic potential (uPA, PAI-1, Cathepsin D, VEGF). No biomarker reflecting tumor angiogenic, invasive or proteolytic potential showed a significant correlation with patient age at diagnosis. In contrast, significant inverse correlations (|r|\u003e0.1; P\u003c or \u003d0.05) were observed for all measures of tumor growth and genetic instability as well as growth factor receptor overexpression (ErbB2 or EGFR positivity). Only one marker of endocrine-dependence, ER expression, showed a significant positive correlation with patient age at diagnosis. In summary, these findings support the hypothesis that breast cancer biology is significantly affected by patient age. In particular, breast tumors arising in older patients have slower growth rates, are more likely to be ER-positive, and are less likely to be p53-positive, EGFR-positive or ErbB2-positive.","title":"Age-associated biomarker profiles of human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"12200028"}
