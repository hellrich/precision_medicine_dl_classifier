About 60% (13/22) of the patients had a tumor thickness of more than 2.5 mm and 45% (10/22) of the patients of over 4 mm. No patient had a thin melanoma (tumor thickness less than 0.76mm) when first diagnosed. Forty-four percent of the patients, which was twice as many as those (22%) in a previous study done at the same hospital, were classified as stage III. Eleven patients (50%) had acral lentiginous melanoma, the most common type of malignant melanoma in Orientals as previously reported. The cumulative survival rate was 59% and 39% at 3 years and 5 years respectively. The age primary sites, clinical stage and tumor thickness were retrospectively evaluated. Due to the small sample size, the accuracy of the statistical analysis of survival is questionable. An extensive island-wide multicenter epidemiologic study is mandatory to clarify this issue.","title":"Malignant melanoma: a clinicopathologic study of 22 cases.","pubmedId":"1680965"}
