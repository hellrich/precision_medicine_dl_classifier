Coinhibition is exploited by prostate cancer as an immune evasion pathway. Overexpression of coinhibitory B7x and B7-H3 in prostate cancer correlates with poor disease outcome, whereas tumor-infiltrating immune cells have enhanced expression of PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1. New insights into the complex mechanisms governing B7 expression in the tumor microenvironment have been reported and therapies aimed at overcoming T cell coinhibition with antagonistic monoclonal antibodies are emerging as effective tumor immunotherapies. Therapies that block B7x and B7-H3, either as monotherapies or in synergism with traditional therapies, should be pursued.
