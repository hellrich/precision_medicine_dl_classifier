Methods:  The assay requires only 10ng of genomic DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tissue blocks. Samples were retrieved from biopsies from either the primary or metastatic lesion. All samples generated usable DNA and the resultant amplicons were sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM platform to achieve in depth coverage of potential mutations.  Results:  Mutations in the tumour suppressor gene TP53 (39.5%) are most commonly identified in our cohort which is consistent with known mutation profiling of gastric carcinoma. We have also identified mutations in MET (8%), PIK3CA (7.5%), KRAS (4%), BRAF (4%) in addition to other known oncogenes.  Lastly, We identified two cases with hotspot mutations in IDH1 (R132H and R132C), hotspot mutation traditionally associated with glioma and acute leukemia, which suggest novel role(s) of this mutant protein in the pathogenic progression of this cancer.  Conclusions:   These findings might predict response to targeted therapeutic agents or have prognostic implications. This study highlights the potential of focused profiling of cancer related genes using the Ion Torrent platform and its advantage of utilizing small amount of DNA from archival pathology specimens.","title":"Results from Ion AmpiSeq Cancer Panel in 200 cases of gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_105878-133"}
