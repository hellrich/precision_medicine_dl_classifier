Unlike IDC, which typically metastasizes to the lung, liver or bone, ILC has been found to metastasize to GI tract, peritoneum and retroperitoneum. Nonspecific symptomology may be considered secondary to other diseases and this can delay the definite diagnosis and treatment of metastatic disease. Knowledge of the pattern of disease spread is essential for accurate diagnosis and early initiation of systemic treatment, thus avoiding unnecessary interventions. We are reporting three unique cases of metastatic ILC presenting with wide range of symptoms.\nCase A: 69-year-old female presented with recurrent jaundice. Case B: 77-year-old female with the past medical history of right breast ILC seven years ago status post right radical mastectomy with chemotherapy, presented with anemia. Case C: 56-year-old female presented with bright red blood per rectum.\nA high level of suspicion is needed for metastatic breast cancer in patients with history of ILC, regardless of disease free interval. Since it frequently metastasizes to unusual sites and presents with a wide spectrum of symptoms.","title":"Unique presentations of invasive lobular breast cancer: a case series.","pubmedId":"25598762"}
