Prediction of therapeutic responses and outcomes is not yet possible, however. In a retrospective study, we examined prognostic factors in patients with breast cancer-derived brain metastasis, and we tested the prognostic utility of a breast cancer-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment in these patients.\nSixty-three patients diagnosed with brain metastasis from breast cancer treated surgically and adjuvantly were included. We examined clinical variables per primary tumor subtype: ER+/HER2- (luminal), HER2+ (human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-enriched) or ER-/PR-/HER2- (triple negative). We also categorized patients\u0027 breast cancer-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment scores and analyzed post-brain metastasis survival time in relation to these categories.\nThe breast cancers comprised the following subtypes: luminal, n \u003d 18; human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-enriched, n \u003d 27 and triple-negative, n \u003d 18; median survival per subtype was 11, 37 and 3 months, respectively. Survival of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-enriched patients was longer, though not significantly (P \u003d 0.188), than that of luminal patients. Survival of triple-negative patients was significantly short (vs. human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-enriched patients, P \u003c 0.001). Karnofsky performance status, HER2 status and the disease-free interval (from initial treatment to first recurrence) were shown to be significant prognostic factors (Karnofsky performance status \u003c 70: relative risk 2.08, P \u003d 0.028; HER2+: relative risk 2.911, P \u003d 0.004; disease-free interval \u003c 24 months: relative risk 1.933, P \u003d 0.011). Breast cancer-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment scores reflected disease-free intervals and survival times.\nOur data indicate that breast cancer-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment-based prediction will be helpful in determining appropriate therapeutic strategies for patients with brain metastasis from breast cancer.","title":"Prolonged survival after diagnosis of brain metastasis from breast cancer: contributing factors and treatment implications.","pubmedId":"25981620"}
