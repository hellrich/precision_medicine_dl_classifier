The present report describes our experience with serious complications of a vincristine overdose in an 18-year-old female who had methotrexate-resistant invasive mole. The patient received VAC therapy as the second line chemotherapy after 2 courses of MTX therapy. In the 6th course of VAC therapy, she was given 5 consecutive daily doses of VCR by mistake. On the 5th day of this VAC therapy, she showed the following toxic symptoms: abdominal pain, lumbago, insomnia, bleeding tendency, absence of motor reflex, leukopenia, and paralytic ileus. These symptoms led to realization of the VCR overdose. Leucovorin calcium administration and supportive treatment were carried out. Although it was difficult to evaluate the efficacy of leucovorin calcium on the vincristine toxic symptoms, she recovered and was discharged on the 36th hospital day.","title":"Toxicity of vincristine overdose in a patient with invasive mole.","pubmedId":"2559130"}
