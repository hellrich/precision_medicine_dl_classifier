In the group of soft tissue sarcomas, the overall incidence of metastases was 22 of 79 (28%). According to the site of origin, the highest incidence was found in tumors originating from the buttocks (57%), followed by those from the inferior limbs (31%). Considering the histology, the incidence ranges from 50% in anaplastic sarcoma, to 43% in rhabdomyosarcoma, to 23% for liposarcoma and fibrosarcoma. The incidence of lymphographically proven metastases in bone tumors was 8 to 46 (17%), with 1 out of 4 in reticulum cell sarcoma, 1/1 in chordoma, and 22% in Ewing\u0027s sarcoma. A radiographic/histologic correlation on the lymph nodes was obtained in 19/79 (24%) soft tissue sarcomas and in 4/46 (9%) bone tumors. In the 12 radiographically negative and 11 radiographically positive cases, this correlation was always correct. The results of this study suggest a larger use of lymphography in these tumors.","title":"Lymphographic evaluation in bone and soft tissue sarcomas.","pubmedId":"898295"}
