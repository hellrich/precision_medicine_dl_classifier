We classified breast cancer cases into subtype luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) according to the status for the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER-2, and Ki-67. Sarcosine metabolism phenotype was stratified according to IHC results for GNMT, SARDH, and PIPOX: GNMT(+), SARDH and PIPOX(-) was classified as high sarcosine type; GNMT(-), SARDH or PIPOX(-) as low sarcosine type; GNMT(+), SARDH or PIPOX(+) as intermediate sarcosine type, and GNMT(-), SARDH and PIPOX(-) as null type.\nExpression of sarcosine metabolism-related proteins differed significantly according to breast cancer subtype (GNMT, p\u003d0.005; SARDH, p\u003d0.012; tumoral PIPOX, p\u003d0.008; stromal PIPOX, p\u003c0.001). These proteins were the most frequently expressed in HER-2 type tumors and the least in TNBC. Sarcosine metabolism phenotype also varied according to breast cancer subtype, with high sarcosine type the most common in HER-2, and null type the most common in TNBC (p\u003d0.003). Univariate analysis revealed that GNMT expression (p\u003d0.042), tumoral PIPOX negativity (p\u003d0.039), and high sarcosine type (p\u003d0.021) were associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS). Multivariate analysis also revealed GNMT expression was an independent factor for shorter DFS (hazard ratio: 2.408, 95% CI: 1.154-5.024, p\u003d0.019).\nExpressions of sarcosine metabolism-related proteins varied according to subtype of breast cancer, with HER-2 type tumors showing elevated expression of these proteins, and TNBC subtype showing decreased expression of these proteins. Expression of sarcosine metabolism-related proteins was also associated with breast cancer prognosis.","title":"Implications of differences in expression of sarcosine metabolism-related proteins according to the molecular subtype of breast cancer.","pubmedId":"24884785"}
