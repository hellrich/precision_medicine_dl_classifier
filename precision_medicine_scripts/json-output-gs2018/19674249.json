To evaluate the prognostic value of CD34 immunostaining of the vessels in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), an automated image analysis method was used.\nIn a nationwide study, covering salivary gland cancer (SGC) patients in Finland 1991-1996, 37 AdCC and 18 MEC patients (M 25, F 30, age 25-90, mean 63) were included. In addition to clinical characteristics the size, shape, staining intensity and vessel density in CD34 immunostained histologic samples were measured.\nAltogether 4433 vessels were measured from AdCC and 2615 from MEC tumor. Of the total tumor vessels measured, 2651 were from patients who deceased with disease (Group I) and 4397 were from specimens derived from those who did not die of disease (Group II) during the 10-year follow-up. The staining intensity was significantly higher in MEC than in AdCC tumor (P \u003d 0.0005). In MEC, the Group I patients had a higher staining intensity among high-grade patients compared with patients with low grade disease, whereas the tumors in Group II had a lower staining intensity among the high-grade compared with the low grade tumors (P \u003d 0.018). A higher vessel density was found in patients with MEC in group II compared with group I (P \u003d 0.017).\nThe staining intensity of CD34 positive vessels in MEC was higher than in AdCC. In MEC, higher staining intensity of vessels in high-grade tumors and lower vessel density in all MEC patients, predicted poor survival.","title":"Morphometric analysis of CD34-positive vessels in salivary gland adenoid cystic and mucoepidermoid carcinomas.","pubmedId":"19674249"}
