Concern about health risks of human exposure to this toxic metal, which may be contained in soil and other environmental compartments, has increased significantly in recent years. Soil ingestion is a potentially important pathway of exposure to soil-absorbed environmental contaminants, especially for young children exhibiting hand-to-mouth behavior. Health risk assessments are usually based on unchanged bioavailability of soil-absorbed pollutants, e.g., heavy metals, neglecting interactions of metals with the soil matrix, which may lead to relatively lower bioavailability. This study was conducted to determine the bioavailability of Cd absorbed to soil in rats. Eight-week-old male Lewis rats were given either a soil polluted with CdCl2 (150 micrograms Cd/rat) dissolved in 5% gun acacia or an equal amount of Cd as CdCl2 dissolved in saline. Control rats were gavaged with isotonic saline. Cd concentrations in liver, kidney, brain, heart, and blood, as well as Cd content of urine and feces were analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Tissue Cd concentrations in soil-treated animals were significantly lower than the tissue concentrations in the Cd-saline group; in the liver and kidneys of the Cd-saline and Cd-soil groups, 4 and 2.7% respectively, of the original doses were recovered. Relative bioavailability, calculated on the basis of blood Cd levels for the Cd-soil group as compared to the Cd-saline group, appeared to be 43%. No differences in the excretion pattern of Cd into feces were observed between the Cd-saline and Cd-soil groups. After 6 days, over 91% of the original dose was recovered in the feces of both Cd-treated groups. Cd excretion via urine was very low, but in the Cd-soil group a significant increase in urinary Cd was observed as compared to the control group. However, the amount of Cd excreted into urine of the Cd-soil group during the experimental period corresponded to only 0.01% of the original dose. In the Cd-saline group, no additional Cd was excreted into urine as compared to the control group. These results indicate that the soil matrix significantly reduced the absorption of Cd in the gastrointestinal tract. Consequently, exposure assessment models, assuming an unaffected bioavailability of soil-absorbed Cd, overestimate the internal dose and thereby overestimate health risks associated with direct ingestion of soil particles.","title":"Bioavailability of soil-adsorbed cadmium in orally exposed male rats.","pubmedId":"9105799"}
