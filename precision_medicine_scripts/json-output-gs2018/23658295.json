The protein kinase BRAF is a driver oncogene in both thyroid cancer and melanoma, but while drugs that target BRAF and its downstream signaling pathway are effective in melanoma, they are ineffective in thyroid cancer. In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Montero-Conde and colleagues investigate why thyroid cancer is resistant to BRAF inhibitors despite the presence of BRAF mutation.","title":"Deja Vu: EGF receptors drive resistance to BRAF inhibitors.","pubmedId":"23658295"}
