Three (14%), 7 (33%), 9 (43%), 18 (86%) and 0 BM specimens were scored positively for HER2, EGFR, pSTAT3, HIF1-α and BRAF V600E expression. The median Ki-67 index was 59%. The microvascular density was moderate-to-high and active intratumoral microvascular sprouting was evident in 20/21 (95%) of BMs. The HER2 and EGFR expression status were consistent between primary tumors and BM in all three assessable cases. HIF1-α and pSTAT3 expression were significantly higher in HER2-positive cases.\nTherapeutic use of agents targeting HER2, pSTAT3, EGFR and angiogenesis may be feasible for selected BM of gastro-esophageal cancer. HER2 positivity does not seem to predispose to brain colonization in gastro-esophageal cancer.","title":"Brain metastases of gastro-oesophageal cancer: evaluation of molecules with relevance for targeted therapies.","pubmedId":"23482783"}
