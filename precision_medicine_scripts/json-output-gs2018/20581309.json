The category \"AML with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-related changes\" (AML-MRC) is separated from \"AML not otherwise specified\" (AML-NOS) by presence of MLD, MDS-related cytogenetics, or history of MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). We analyzed 408 adult patients categorized as AML-MRC or AML-NOS. Three-year event-free survival (EFS; median, 13.8 vs 16.0 months) and 3-year overall survival (OS; 45.8% vs 53.9%) did not differ significantly between patients with MLD versus without. However, MLD correlated with preexisting MDS (P \u003c .001) and MDS-related cytogenetics (P \u003d .035). Patients with MLD as sole AML-MRC criterion (AML-MLD-sole; n \u003d 90) had less frequently FLT3 internal tandem duplication (P \u003d .032) and lower median age than AML-NOS (n \u003d 232). Contrarily, patients with AML-NOS combined with AML-MLD-sole (n \u003d 323) had better 3-year EFS (16.9 vs 10.7 months; P \u003d .005) and 3-year OS (55.8% vs 32.5%; P \u003d .001) than patients with history of MDS or MDS/MPN or MDS-related cytogenetics (n \u003d 85). Gene expression analysis showed distinct clusters for AML-MLD-sole combined with AML-NOS versus AML with MDS-related cytogenetics or MDS history. Thus, MLD alone showed no independent clinical effect, whereas cytogenetics and MDS history were prognostically relevant.","title":"Multilineage dysplasia (MLD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) correlates with MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities and a prior history of MDS or MDS/MPN but has no independent prognostic relevance: a comparison of 408 cases classified as \"AML not otherwise specified\" (AML-NOS) or \"AML with myelodysplasia-related changes\" (AML-MRC).","pubmedId":"20581309"}
