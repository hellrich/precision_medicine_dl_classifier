The samples were processed for RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis and were subsequently analyzed for the expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK19), cytokeratin 20(CK20) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with multiplex PCR.\nStatistical analysis revealed that the combination of CK19 and CK20 could be useful in the exclusion of colorectal cancer, as well as the diagnosis and exclusion of gastric cancer. Furthermore, the expression of EGFR was correlated with the presence of systemic disease in patients with colorectal cancer.\nMultiplex-PCR-based detection of circulating tumor cells could serve as a useful tool for the diagnosis, and monitoring of patients with colorectal and gastric cancer.","title":"Detection of circulating tumor cells in colorectal and gastric cancer using a multiplex PCR assay.","pubmedId":"24922677"}
