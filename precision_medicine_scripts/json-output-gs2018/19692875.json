We have selected 68 cases consecutively treated for thyroid carcinoma with a total thyroidectomy. The inclusion criteria considered the patients treated with conventional thyroidectomy and the patients treated with the MIVAT. Our follow-up examination was conducted in agreement with the guidelines of the European Consensus Conference.\nWe have identified a first group of cases; group A, which stored the cases treated with the MIVAT technique. This group contained 9 males and 27 females; the median age was 49.69+/-9.26 years. Group B contained 6 males and 26 females treated with the conventional thyroidectomy; the median age was 44.15+/-11.73 years. The postoperative pain at 24 hours after the surgical procedure in A group was 1.033+/-0.87, whereas in B group it was 1.915+/-1.24 (P\u003c0.05).The neoplastic node diameter was 13.31+/-6.31 mm in group A and 16.36+/-8.15 mm in group B (P\u003dns). All of the patients were treated with radioiodine. The value of thyroglobulin after 12 months in group A was 0.648+/-0.2 ng/mL whereas the value was 0.705+/-0.2 ng/mL in group B (P\u003dns).\nWe think that MIVAT for the right cases is a safe and valid surgical procedure for differentiated thyroid cancer. This technique has a challenging learning curve, and the surgeons must be experts in conventional thyroid surgery.","title":"Minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy in differentiated thyroid cancer: a 1-year follow-up.","pubmedId":"19692875"}
