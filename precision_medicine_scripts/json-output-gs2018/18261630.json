Recently, an increase in the incidence of HNSCC in young adults has been recognized, many of them nonsmokers and females. Functional inactivation of p16 is known to be a common event in HNSCC, mainly by either deletion or methylation. A previous study by this group has shown that p16 deletions in HNSCC are significantly associated with age. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate additional molecular alterations of p16 in HNSCC, specifically in relation to age, site, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status. Patients ranging in age from 22 to 76 years with HNSCC were prospectively identified (n \u003d 24). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate p16 gene inactivation and p16 protein expression, respectively. HPV 16 status was determined for each case. Overall, p16 inactivation was a frequent event detected in 46% of cases. Methylation of p16 was more often detected in females than males (P \u003d .05). All cases showing p16 methylation were from the anterior tongue, and 75% of them were young patients. The results indicate that p16 methylation is a more common event in those younger than 40 years in contrast to p16 deletions, which are more common in those older than 40 years. Consequently, it appears that specific modes of inactivation of p16 in HNSCC are related to specific patient risk profiles. Interestingly, HPV 16 messenger RNA was detected exclusively in HNSCC from the base of tongue lesions and was only found in males. This differs from the patient profile of HNSCC in the young, which affects the anterior tongue and commonly females, thus, making it highly unlikely that this virus is a primary causative agent of HNSCC in these young adults.","title":"p16(INK4A) genetic and epigenetic profiles differ in relation to age and site in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.","pubmedId":"18261630"}
