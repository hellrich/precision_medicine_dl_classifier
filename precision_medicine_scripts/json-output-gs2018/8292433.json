The incidence of synchronous carcinomas was 5.5% (20 cases). Only 30% of them were diagnosed preoperatively, and up to 40% were discovered in the pathological examination. In 2 patients 3 synchronous tumors were well found. All the synchronous neoplasms were differentiated, 65% of them were Dukes stage A. Synchronous colorectal polyps were found in 80% of patients. Complete exploration of the colon preoperatively by a routine pan-colonoscopy is recommended. In regard to the treatment of patients with synchronous colorectal carcinomas, partial colectomies are indicated as long as oncological criteria are followed, and the colon had been fully explored.","title":"[Synchronous colonic and rectal carcinomas].","pubmedId":"8292433"}
