BRAF mutations have been identified approximately 50% of melanoma. V600 mutations increase BRAF kinase activity promoting melanoma growth. Approximately 90% of all identified BRAF mutations are V600E and 5%-12% are V600K amino acid substitutions. Targeted agents that inhibit BRAF kinase activity have improved progression-free survival when used in BRAF mutant melanoma. RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways are key players in melanoma progression and drug resistance. CLART CMA BRAF-MEK1-AKT1 is a novel diagnostic assay to evaluate the BRAF V600E/K mutation in order to screen patients for treatment with inhibitor of BRAF kinase activity. Moreover this is able to identify mutations in MEK1 and AKT1 genes that could be related with resistance to inhibitors of BRAF kinase activity. Methods: Specific ARMS-primers and hybridization probes for detecting mutations BRAF V600E and V600K, MEK1 I111S, P124S and E203K, and AKT1 Q79K were designed. Clinical testing was performed using 155 samples which contained the targets of this assay and samples with wild type alleles. The results were cross checked by comparison to Sanger sequencing methodology. Results: Analytical sensitivity was assessed using recombinant plasmids, results ranged in 1000 copies/l for the most prevalent BRAF V600E mutation. For the rest of mutations in BRAF, MEK1 and AKT1 results ranged in 10000 copies/l. Mutations BRAF V600E and V600K were analyzed using specific cell lines, the sensitivity were 0.5ng and 5ng respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity data was over 93% for all mutations, and diagnostic specificity data was 100% for all mutations. Conclusions: CLART CMA BRAF-MEK1-AKT1 detects the most prevalent BRAF V600 mutations (V600E/K), MEK1 I111S, P124S and E203K, and AKT1 Q79K mutation, with sensitivity  93% and reproducibility  98%, being capable to detect mutations in samples with at least 10% of tumor cells. Our data support the use of this technology for clinical testing prior to selection of the appropriate treatment in melanoma.","title":"BRAF, MEK1, AKT1 testing by a new diagnostic method to detect point mutations associated with melanoma: CLART CMA BRAF-MEK1-AKT1.","pubmedId":"ASCO_168083-176"}
