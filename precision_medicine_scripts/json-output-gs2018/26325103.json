For a pair to be included, in the endoscopic biopsy, 20% of invasive adenocarcinoma cells should be present and enough slides to yield an extracted DNA concentration of ⩾5 ng μl(-1), and no \u003c2 ng μl(-1) should be available for cutting. Exons 2-4 KRAS/NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA molecular evaluation was performed with RT-PCR and Sequenom.\nFrom 165 deemed adequate by the pathologist pairs, 85 (51.5%) were concordantly mutated in at least one of the tested genes, 70 (42.5%) were wt and 10 (6%) were discordant, harbouring a mutation in the primary and not in the endoscopic biopsy. In the re-evaluation, when more slides were cut per discordant pair, mutational status changed in two of the six discordantly KRAS-mutated pairs. A strong strength of agreement for both runs was observed (Cohen\u0027s kappa, k\u003d0.877, P\u003c0.001 and k\u003d0.901, P\u003c0.001, respectively) between the surgically acquired and the endoscopic biopsy specimens\u0027 evaluation.\nBased on our results, an endoscopic biopsy could provide an accurate mutational profile and become a justified alternative to a surgically removed primary tumour specimen, as long as specific histopathology criteria are met.","title":"KRAS, NRAS, BRAF mutation comparison of endoscopic and surgically removed primary CRC paired samples: is endoscopy biopsy material adequate for molecular evaluation?","pubmedId":"26325103"}
