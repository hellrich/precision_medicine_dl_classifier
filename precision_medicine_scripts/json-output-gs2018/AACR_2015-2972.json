{"genes":["RAS","NF1","LCK protein"],"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["2015 AACR Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"We describe here the landscape of genomic alterations in cutaneous melanomas through DNA, RNA, and protein-based analysis of 333 resected primary and/or metastatic melanomas from 331 patients. We establish a framework for genomic classification based on the pattern of the most prevalent significantly mutated genes into one of four subtypes: mutant BRAF, RAS, NF1, and Triple-WT (wild-type). Integrative analysis reveals enrichment of mutations in KIT, focal amplifications and complex structural rearrangements as a feature of the Triple-WT subtype. We find no significant outcome correlation with genomic classification, but samples assigned to a transcriptomic subclass enriched for immune gene expression are significantly associated with improved patient survival. That favorable prognosis of the immune transcriptomic subclass is associated with high LCK protein expression, a T-cell marker, and presence of lymphocyte infiltrate on pathology review. This clinicopathological and multi-dimensional analysis suggests prognosis of melanoma patients with nodal metastases is influenced by immunobiology of the tumor stroma, offering insights to further personalize therapeutic decision-making.","title":"Genomic classification of cutaneous melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2972"}
