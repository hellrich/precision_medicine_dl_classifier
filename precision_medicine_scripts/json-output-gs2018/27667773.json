Nivolumab is approved in the USA and EU for advanced melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC, and relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma in the USA. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a PD-1 ligand, is expressed on mononuclear leukocytes, myeloid cells, and tumor cells. PD-L1 is being investigated as a potential biomarker to predict the association of tumor PD-L1 expression with nivolumab efficacy.\nBristol-Myers Squibb and Dako previously reported on an automated PD-L1 immunohistochemical (IHC) assay that detects cell surface PD-L1 in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, human tumor tissue specimens using Dako\u0027s Autostainer Link 48. The primary antibody for this assay is a rabbit monoclonal antihuman PD-L1 antibody, clone 28-8. Another rabbit monoclonal antihuman PD-L1 antibody, clone E1L3N, was compared with 28-8 for specificity and sensitivity using an identical detection method followed by vendor-recommended detection methods.\nUsing PD-L1 null clones of L2987 and ES-2 tumor cell lines, both antibodies were specific for detection of PD-L1 on the plasma membrane, although E1L3N also stained cytoplasm in ES-2 knockout cells. Using the identical method, E1L3N was slightly more sensitive than 28-8 based on staining intensities. Using manufacturer-recommended detection methods and predefined scoring criteria for plasma membrane staining of tumor and immune cells, 28-8 demonstrated significantly improved detection compared with E1L3N.\nEpitope retrieval and highly sensitive detection reagents are key determinants in IHC detection of PD-L1.","title":"An Analytical Comparison of Dako 28-8 PharmDx Assay and an E1L3N Laboratory-Developed Test in the Immunohistochemical Detection of Programmed Death-Ligand 1.","pubmedId":"27667773"}
