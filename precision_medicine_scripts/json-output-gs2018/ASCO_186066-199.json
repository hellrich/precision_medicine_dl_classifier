The mechanisms of resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs are largely unknown and clinical cross-resistance among 3rd gen EGFR TKIs has not been routinely evaluated. Osimertinib is an FDA-approved irreversible 3rd gen EGFR TKI. In patients with EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC, the response rate (ORR) to osimertinib is 61%. EGF816 is a covalent, irreversible, 3rd gen EGFR TKI in clinical development. In early phase data of EGF816, the ORR was 47% and disease control rate was 87% in patients with EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. To assess clinical cross-resistance between EGF816 and osimertinib, we evaluated the clinical outcomes of patients treated with osimertinib in patients previously treated with EGF816 during the phase I/II trial. Methods: Patients with metastatic EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma were identified who were previously treated with EGF816 and received osimertinib after progression of disease on EGF816 (NCT02108964). All patients had documented T790M mutation prior to treatment with EGF816. The best overall response to osimertinib was determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Duration of clinical benefit was defined as duration of osimertinib therapy. Results: Fourteen (3 men, 11 women, median age 58 [range 33-77]) patients met eligibility criteria at our centers. The ORR to subsequent osimertinib therapy was 14% (1 CR, 1 PR, 8 SD, 4 POD). Patients continued treatment with osimertinib for a median of 9 months (95% CI 3.8-10.1, [median follow up 11 months, range 1-13 months]). 5 patients are still on osimertinib to date (one patient each 3+, 6+, 8+, 11+, and 12+ months). Conclusions: This series suggests a potentially meaningful clinical benefit for patients with sequential therapy with two different third-generation EGFR inhibitors, emphasizing the importance of understanding resistance mechanisms (genetic alteration of target, bypass signaling, pharmacology, etc.) and raising the possibility of the need for multiple third generation EGFR TKIs in clinical practice.","title":"Response to osimertinib following treatment with EGF816 in patients with T790M EGFR mutant NSLCLC.","pubmedId":"ASCO_186066-199"}
