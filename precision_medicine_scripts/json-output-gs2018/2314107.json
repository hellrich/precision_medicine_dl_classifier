Two months post-operatively he presented with a thyroid mass as initial evidence of disseminated disease. Subsequent workup also demonstrated pulmonary metastases. A total thyroidectomy radical neck dissection and multi-agent chemotherapy has controlled the disease in his neck. As far as we are aware, this is the first case report of malignant melanoma metastatic to the thyroid. The potentially beneficial role of surgery in the management of metastatic melanoma and the relation of melanoma to the hormonal axis is discussed.","title":"Malignant melanoma metastatic to the thyroid as initial evidence of disseminated disease.","pubmedId":"2314107"}
