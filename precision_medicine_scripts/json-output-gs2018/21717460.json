DNA microarray and immunohistochemical analyses have shown that most TNBCs fall within the basal-like histological subset of breast cancers, which frequently exhibit inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) and upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a)  (p16). However, downregulation of p16 expression has been observed in some basal-like breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that such cells can be divided into two groups according to Rb and p16 status. We now show that cells that are CD44(+)  and CD24(-) , a phenotype associated with stem-like breast cancer cells, are more abundant in ER(-) /p16(-)  breast cancer cell lines than in ER(-) /p16(+)  lines. It was also found that p16 expression was downregulated in mammospheres from an ER-negative breast cancer cell line. Depletion of p16 by RNA interference in ER-negative breast cancer cells increased the percentage of CD44(+) /CD24(-)  cells and increased the expression of mRNA of the ES-like genes Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 through an Rb-independent pathway. Furthermore, such depletion of p16 reduced chemosensitivity. The loss of p16 expression may thus reduce the response of ER-negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy by conferring cancer stem cell-like properties. Consistent with this conclusion, immunohistochemical analysis of the clinical samples suggests that low p16 expression in TNBC is associated with resistance to preoperative chemotherapy.","title":"Loss of p16 expression is associated with the stem cell characteristics of surface markers and therapeutic resistance in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.","pubmedId":"21717460"}
