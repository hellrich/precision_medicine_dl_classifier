EGF induced a rapid increase in phosphotyrosine followed by relatively gradual increases in phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. On the other hand, the TPA-induced increase in phosphorylations occurred exclusively on serine and threonine residues. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping analysis suggested that treatments with EGF and TPA induced phosphorylation of many common sites in the c-erbB-2 gene product. However, in contrast to TPA, EGF increased the phosphorylation of the c-erbB-2 protein in cells whose protein kinase C had been down-regulated by long-term pretreatment with TPA, suggesting that EGF and TPA induce phosphorylation by different mechanisms. Since the c-erbB-2 gene product did not show detectable EGF-binding activity, phosphorylation of tyrosine of the c-erbB-2 gene product might be catalyzed directly by the EGF receptor kinase that was activated by EGF.","title":"Tumor promoter and epidermal growth factor stimulate phosphorylation of the c-erbB-2 gene product in MKN-7 human adenocarcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"2897079"}
