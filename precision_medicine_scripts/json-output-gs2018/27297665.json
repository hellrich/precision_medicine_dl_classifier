The TKI was selected according to the pretransplantation TKI response, anticipated toxicities, and ABL1 domain mutations, when present. Newer generation TKIs were initiated at a ≥ 50% dose reduction from the standard pretransplantation dosing to limit the toxicities and avoid therapy interruptions. TKIs were started a median of 100 days (range, 28-238 days) after transplantation and were administered for a median of 16 months (range, 8 days to 105 months). Eight patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 4 months to 8.7 years), the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 61%. All 3 patients who developed a relapse underwent successful salvage treatment and remained disease-free. The 5-year overall survival rate was 78%.\nMaintenance TKI therapy after transplantation is feasible and might reduce the incidence of relapses and improve outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with high-risk Ph(+) leukemia.","title":"Does Post-Transplant Maintenance Therapy With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Improve Outcomes of Patients With High-Risk Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Leukemia?","pubmedId":"27297665"}
