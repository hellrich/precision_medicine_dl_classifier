Although additional options represent progress, the availability of 3 second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) and 1 third-generation TKI (ponatinib) has added complexity to the treatment paradigm for CML, particularly CML in the chronic phase. Two second-generation agents (dasatinib and nilotinib) are approved for use as first-line and subsequent therapy. Thus, the appropriate sequencing of TKIs is a frequent quandary, and is incompletely addressed in clinical guidelines. Here, we review studies that might guide selection of a second- or third-generation TKI after failure of TKI therapy in patients with chronic-phase CML. These studies evaluate prognostic factors such as first-line cytogenetic response and BCR-ABL1 mutation status, which might help physicians identify patients who are likely to respond to second-generation TKIs, and those for whom ponatinib or an investigational agent might be more appropriate. We summarize evidence to date that suggests that use of a second-generation TKI as third-line therapy confers limited value in most CML patients, and we also explore the utility of current event-free survival versus traditional outcomes to predict long-term benefits of sequential TKI use. Finally, we present 3 case studies to illustrate how prognostic factors and other considerations (eg, tolerability) can be used to individualize subsequent therapy in cases of TKI resistance or intolerance.
