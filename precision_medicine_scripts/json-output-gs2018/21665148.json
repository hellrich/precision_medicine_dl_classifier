Here, we report that PlGF levels are elevated in CML and that PlGF produced by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) aggravates disease severity. CML cells foster a soil for their own growth by inducing BMSCs to upregulate PlGF, which not only stimulates BM angiogenesis, but also promotes CML proliferation and metabolism, in part independently of Bcr-Abl1 signaling. Anti-PlGF treatment prolongs survival of imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML mice and adds to the anti-CML activity of imatinib. These results may warrant further investigation of the therapeutic potential of PlGF inhibition for (imatinib-resistant) CML.","title":"Loss or inhibition of stromal-derived PlGF prolongs survival of mice with imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl1(+) leukemia.","pubmedId":"21665148"}
