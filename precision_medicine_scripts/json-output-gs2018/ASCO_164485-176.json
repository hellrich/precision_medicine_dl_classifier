We compared non-RAS/RAF mutational frequencies among pts with RASmut, BRAFMut and wt RAS/BRAFtumors in an effort to identify potential drivers of resistance to targeted therapies. Methods: We identified 270 pts from a database which included all pts with mCRC who had targeted next-generation sequencing of clinical tumor specimens between 2013-2015 at Mayo Clinic. The 3 groups (RASmut, BRAFMut and wt RAS/BRAF) were compared for mutation frequencies in 46 additional cancer-related genes. Results: Among all pts with mCRC, mutations were most common in the APC, KRAS and TP53 genes which accounted for 18.8%, 20.3% and 28.0% of all mutations, respectively. There were significant differences in the frequencies of commonly mutated genes of known function within the 3 groups. Compared to wt RAS/BRAF, BRAFMut tumors had significantly fewer APC (p \u003d 0.0194) and TP53 (p \u003d 0.0061) mutations, yet significantly more AKT (p \u003d 0.0048) and MET (p \u003d 0.0235) mutations. RASmuttumors had significantly more APC (p \u003d 0.0008) and PIK3CA (p \u003d 0.0064) mutations and fewer TP53mutations (p \u003d 0.0004) compared with wt RAS/BRAF. Conclusions: We found significant heterogeneity in the mutational spectrum within mCRC according to whether they harbor RAS or BRAFV600E mutations. Tumors with BRAFV600E were enriched in AKT and MET mutations that have been implicated in resistance to BRAF-inhibition in mCRC. RASmuttumors had highest rates of APC mutations indicating dependence the Wnt signaling pathway in these tumors. These data identify important pathogenic mutations that likely play a role in pathogenesis and are potentially actionable in patients with mCRCs.","title":"Mutation analysis in metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRC) subjected to gene panel testing for BRAF and KRAS genes in clinical practice.","pubmedId":"ASCO_164485-176"}
