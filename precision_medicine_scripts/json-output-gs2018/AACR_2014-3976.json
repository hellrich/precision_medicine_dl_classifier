It is mainly expressed by myeloid cells and is involved in a broad range of host defense mechanisms. However, a variety of host-derived agonists of FPR1 have been identified, including formyl peptides released from disrupted mitochondria of necrotic cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that FPR1 is expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumors and high expression is correlated with poor overall survival. Addition of the FPR1 agonist N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) to neuroblastoma cells in vitro causes enhanced proliferative activity, increase of intracellular calcium response and activation of STAT3 and MAPK/Erk signaling pathways. Currently, clonal neuroblastoma cell line with inducible activity of FPR1 gene is under testing in a mouse model to assess the significance of this receptor in vivo. Our findings so far suggest that FPR1 may play a significant role in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and that therapeutic intervention of the FPR1 pathway may become an important clinical strategy in neuroblastoma therapy.","title":"Expression of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) in neuroblastoma: Implications in tumorigenesis","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3976"}
