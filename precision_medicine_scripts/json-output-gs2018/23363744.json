The incidence of newly diagnosed AAL (â‰¥ 14-year-old) in 2010 were analyzed retrospectively.\n(1) 759 new cases of AL were diagnosed in 2010 in Fujian Province. The annual incidence of AL was 2.057/10(5), among which acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\\[except acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)\\] was 1.179/10(5), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was 0.569/10(5), and APL was 0.309/10(5). The number of patients with AML was higher than that of patients with ALL and APL, with the ratio of AML:ALL:APL being 3.82:1.84:1. (2) There was a male preponderance, the ratio of male/female was 1.24:1. The incidence of AML was slightly higher in men (1.307/10(5)) than in women (1.044/10(5)). There was no significant difference in incidence between men and women in ALL and APL. (3) Most of AAL patients were elderly adult in Fujian Province. (4) There was statistical difference in AAL incidence among different regions of Fujian Province. Infections of Hepatitis B virus might be a risk factor for leukemia.\nThe incidence of adult AL in Fujian Province is similar to the previous studies which was carried out by Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences during 1986 and 1988.","title":"[An epidemiological investigation of adult acute leukemia in Fujian Province in 2010].","pubmedId":"23363744"}
