In both groups, plasma concentration peaked in a median of 0.5 hours, and mean terminal elimination half-lives were comparable. Mean +/- SD pharmacokinetic parameters in cirrhotic versus healthy subjects were slightly different (Cmax, 7.7 +/- 4.9 vs. 5.6 +/- 1.3 micrograms/ml; AUC(0-t), 18.5 +/- 7.5 vs. 14.2 +/- 2.1 micrograms.h/ml, respectively). Mean apparent total clearance and mean renal clearance in both groups were comparable. Mean protein-bound fractions were equivalent; binding appeared unaltered by metabolites. One cirrhotic and 2 healthy subjects each reported one adverse event. No statistically significant or clinically relevant alteration in pharmacokinetic parameters of nateglinide resulted from hepatic dysfunction, and it was well tolerated; therefore, adjustment of nateglinide dosage is not required in subjects with mild to moderate cirrhosis.","title":"Single-dose pharmacokinetics of nateglinide in subjects with hepatic cirrhosis.","pubmedId":"10868314"}
