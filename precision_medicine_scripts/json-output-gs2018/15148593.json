The neoplastic cells were Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-negative. T-cell PTLPD is an uncommon but recognized late complication in solid organ transplant recipients. This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of PTLPD occurring in childhood with an ALK+, CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma phenotype.","title":"Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder presenting as CD30+, ALK+, anaplastic large cell lymphoma in a child.","pubmedId":"15148593"}
