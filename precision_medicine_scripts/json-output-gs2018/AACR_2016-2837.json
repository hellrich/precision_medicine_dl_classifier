It is critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for NHSCC. Deregulation of CDKN2A (p16) or CCND1 (cyclin D1) occurs commonly in HNSCC and induces sustained cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 activation. The selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, LY2835219 inhibited CDK4/6-dependent Ser780 phosphorylation in retinoblastoma (RB) and induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition. In an animal xenograft model of HNSCC, LY2835219 treatment led to reduced tumor growth. However, because single-agent treatment with LY2835219 showed a limited effect in HNSCC, a combinational strategy is necessary for effective therapy. At the molecular level, we found that LY2835219 inhibited activation of AKT and ERK, but not mTOR. The combination of LY2835219 with mTOR inhibitor was found to be more effective than either drug alone in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that a combination treatment with LY2835219 and mTOR inhibitor is a promising therapeutic approach for HNSCC.","title":"The CDK4/6 inhibitor has potent activity in combination with mTOR inhibitor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2837"}
