We analyzed the amount and phenotype of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and the expression of the apoptosis-inducing molecule Fas and its ligand, FasL, on tumor cells and TIL in a selected series of UMM with the aim to establish if a correlation between their expression and the clinical behavior of UMM exists. TIL phenotype and Fas/FasL expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 61 cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded UMM. Results were compared with the follow-up data of patients. Most of the UMM showed a prevalence of CD8+ CD3+ T lymphocytes, or CD4+ and CD8+ cells in equal amounts. UMM showed a variable expression of FasL, ranging from 0 to \u003e 40% of neoplastic cells. Fas was always expressed in TIL, although with a variable extent. A subgroup of UMM showed in TIL a strongly reduced or even absent expression of TCR zeta-chain, involved in activation of T-lymphocytes. This subgroup was characterized by a worse outcome. We hypothesized that an impaired cytotoxic immune response due to the loss of the zeta-chain expression plays a primary role in the biological course of UMM. Our results indicate that the overcoming of the impairment of TCR function may represent a prerequisite for the development of new therapeutic strategies for managing UMM, suggesting that elimination of tumor cells may be possible by activation of cytotoxic cells present within ocular melanomas.","title":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in uveal melanoma: a link with clinical behavior?","pubmedId":"16569355"}
