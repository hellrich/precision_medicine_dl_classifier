In contrast to sALCL, pcALCL is rarely found in children and young adults. We present here a case of a rare clinical condition in a 21-year-old woman, who has pcALCL with positive ALK and patchy EMA expression. She experiences a large, rapidly growing nodule without any outside-nodule manifestation. In conclusion, both ALK and EMA expression alone cannot distinguish pcALCL from secondary skin involvement by a sALCL.
