Considering that metastatic melanoma is almost completely resistant to most current therapies and is linked with a poor patient prognosis, it is crucial to further investigate potential molecular targets. Major cell-autonomous drivers in the pathogenesis of this disease include the classical MAPK (i.e., RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK), WNT, and PI3K signaling pathways. These pathways play a major role in defining the progression of melanoma, and some have been the subject of recent pharmacological strategies to treat this belligerent disease. This review describes the latest advances in the understanding of melanoma progression and the major molecular pathways involved. In addition, we discuss the roles of emerging molecular players that are involved in melanoma pathogenesis, including the functional role of the melanoma tumor antigen, p97/MFI2 (melanotransferrin).
