The exact contribution of CDKN2A/ARF to disease risk remains poorly characterized, especially in diverse populations. In this report, the contribution of CDKN2A/ARF germline mutations and large rearrangements to disease in Polish familial MM (FMM) and aggregations of breast cancer and MM were assessed using a strategy that included genomic sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. We examined 16 FMM cases (group 1), 44 MM probands with a cancer family aggregation (CFA) that included at least one breast cancer (group 2) and 22 breast cancer probands with CFA and MM (group 3). The results revealed a paucity of mutations in CDKN2A/ARF, suggesting that in the Polish population this gene does not contribute significantly to either FMM or MM within the context of CFA.","title":"Germline mutation and large deletion analysis of the CDKN2A and ARF genes in families with multiple melanoma or an aggregation of malignant melanoma and breast cancer.","pubmedId":"15122588"}
