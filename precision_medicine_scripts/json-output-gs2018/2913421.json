This manuscript reports the efficacy of using circulating squamous cell carcinoma antigen in evaluating patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Serum samples from 89 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were obtained before treatment and at intervals following treatment. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Elevated pretreatment serum levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen were identified in 39 of 89 patients (44%) who had head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 16 patients evaluated from this group with recurrent or persistent disease, 15 (93.5%) demonstrated elevated levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen. However, of the 21 evaluable patients who remained disease free, only 10 (48%) had post-therapy levels within the normal range. The possible use of this marker in aiding the clinical follow-up of head and neck cancer patients is discussed.","title":"SCC-RIA in the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"2913421"}
