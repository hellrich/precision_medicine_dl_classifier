There is no therapeutic measure with curative potential apart from surgical treatment. Partial or extended hepatectomy is the treatment of choice in cholangiocarcinoma. Thereby, hilar resection in combination with hepatectomy is increasingly performed in proximal bile duct carcinomas. In most centers liver transplantation is not considered as a therapeutic option for irresectable cholangiocarcinomas.","title":"[Surgical treatment of cholangiocellular carcinoma and proximal bile duct tumors].","pubmedId":"10960975"}
