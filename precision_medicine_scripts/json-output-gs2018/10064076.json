However, little is still known about natural anti-MAGE responses in vivo. We have studied a case of spontaneously regressing human melanoma, hypothesizing that in this unique situation, the host immune system had developed an efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against the cancer cells. Amongst the dense tumor infiltrate, certain clonal populations of T cells were shown to be amplified, thereby suggesting that an antigen-driven selection had occurred at the tumor site. One of the expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was shown to be a Vbeta13+ CD8+ CTL displaying a strong and selective cytotoxic activity against the autologous melanoma cells. Here we show that this cytotoxic T cell clone recognizes a MAGE-6-encoded peptide. MAGE-6 is therefore the fourth gene of the MAGE family shown to encode antigenic peptide recognized by T cells. Together, these data provide further evidence that T cell responses against MAGE antigens may naturally develop in vivo.","title":"A MAGE-6-encoded peptide is recognized by expanded lymphocytes infiltrating a spontaneously regressing human primary melanoma lesion.","pubmedId":"10064076"}
