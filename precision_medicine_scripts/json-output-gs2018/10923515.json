The p16 mRNA expression was not obviously correlated with patient age, tumor size, estrogen and progesterone receptor status (P \u003e 0.05), but the positive rate of 54.4% for the lymph node metastasis group was significantly lower than 85.7% of the non-metastasis group (P \u003c 0.001). Moreover, the positive rate of 58.3% for the poor differentiate invasive duct carcinoma was also lower than that 89.7% for the well differentiated (P \u003c 0.05). The patients after operation were followed up. The mortality of 25% (21/85) in the p16 mRNA positive group was significantly lower than that of the negative group 57% (20/35) (P \u003c 0.01).\nAbnormal expression of p16 mRNA may play an important role in the development of human breast carcinoma.","title":"[In situ hybrid detection of p16 mRNA in primary breast carcinoma: its clinicopathologic significance].","pubmedId":"10923515"}
