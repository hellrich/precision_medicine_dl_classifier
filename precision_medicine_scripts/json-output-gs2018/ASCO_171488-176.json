Here, we report broad proteomic analysis of NSCLC cell lines after treatment with the allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitor BAY86-9766. Methods: We treated 109 NSCLC cell lines with BAY86-9766. Proteomic analysis for total and phospho-proteins was performed by reverse phase protein array. Results: BAY86-9766 was effective at reducing pERK ( \u003c 0.001) but this modulation was not significantly different between sensitive and resistant cell lines (P \u003d 0.64). MEK inhibition induced expression and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) including pEGFR, pHER2, pMET, pAXL, EGFR, VEGFR2, MET, KIT, IGF1R, and AXL (all \u003c 0.001). This suggests a dominant negative feedback effect of the MAPK pathway on RTKs that is relieved upon MEK inhibition. MEK-ERK signaling is known to enhance stability of c-MYC. Moreover, c-MYC has been shown to be a negative regulator of RTKs transcription. Indeed, BAY86-9766 caused a decrease in c-MYC ( \u003c 0.001) and phospho-c-MYC ( \u003c 0.001) providing a potential explanation for the observed activation of RTKs in MEK-inhibitor treated NSCLC cells. The PI3K pathway was also activated in response to MEK inhibition with increased levels of pAKT(S473), pAKT(T308), AKT, and PI3K P110 as well as the AKT target GSK3 (all P \u003c 0.02). In line with this, PTEN knockdown promoted MEKi resistance while overexpression increased MEKi sensitivity in vitro. MEK inhibition resulted in a dramatic increase in the expression of DNA damage response proteins; pATM(S1981), pATR(S428), pCHK1(s345), ATM, RAD50, RAD25, PARP, ERCC1, XRCC, BRCA1, MSH2, and KU80 (all P \u003c 0.01). MEK inhibition led to decreased pLKB1(S428) ( \u003c 0.001), increased total LKB1 ( \u003c 0.001), pAMPK(T172) (P \u003d 0.017), and AMPK ( \u003c 0.001) indicating activation of LKB1-AMPK pathway in response to MEK inhibition. Conclusions: Our data uncovers a burst of signaling in several oncogenic pathways upon MEK inhibition. Taken together, this preclinical data help defining mechanisms of MEK inhibition resistance allowing rational design of combination therapies for NSCLC.","title":"Reprogramming of cell signaling in response to MEK inhibition in non-small cell cancer (NSCLC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_171488-176"}
