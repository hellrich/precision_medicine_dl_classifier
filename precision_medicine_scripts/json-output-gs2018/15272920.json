Statistical analyses were obtained by means of Fisher\u0027s exact test.\nAll mutations detected involved a T \u003e A transversion at 1796 (V599E) and were heterozygous. Overall, BRAF(V599E) mutation was found in 18/56 (32.1%) PTCs. According to the histological type of the tumour, the mutation was present in 38.3% of cases of conventional PTC (18/47), in 0/6 follicular variant of PTC, in 0/3 oncocytic variant of PTC. No BRAF mutations were detected either in five follicular carcinomas, or in four poorly differentiated or undifferentiated cancers or in benign thyroid disorders. No statistically significant correlation of BRAF mutation with patient age and gender, with multicentricity of the tumour, with the lymphocytic infiltration of the tissue, with the stage and with the recurrence rate, was found. BRAF(V599E) tended to be associated, although not significantly, with a greater volume and extension of the tumour and with lymph-nodal metastases at surgery.\nIn conclusion, the present study on the first Italian series of thyroid cancers shows a frequency of 38.3% of BRAF(V599E) in the classical variant of PTC, confirming the key role of this mutation in promoting tumourigenesis.","title":"BRAF mutations in an Italian cohort of thyroid cancers.","pubmedId":"15272920"}
