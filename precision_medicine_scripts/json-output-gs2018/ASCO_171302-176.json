Glucose consumption rates assessed by 18F-FDG PET/CT have been used to stage and monitor the response to therapy in patients with melanoma. We aim to explore whether local 18F-FDG uptake can predict systemic response and how it correlates with intratumoral infiltration measured by the proportion of exhausted antigen experienced T cells (TEx)/Total CD8+ cells. Methods: Following core biopsies or surgical excision, freshly isolated tumor samples were digested and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were extracted and stained with T cell myeloid and activation markers, and analyzed with 14 color FACS. Patients were treated with either Nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2 week or Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg q3 week. TEx was calculated as % CD8+, PD-1+, CTLA-4+ cells divided by total CD8+ T cells in the tumor sample. Thirty-nine patients (23 males) with measurable advanced melanoma were included. The closest in time, (49  22 days), standard of care whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT to the biopsy was used for analysis. Uptake was measured by maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at the biopsied lesion. Treatment response was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), for a period of 149 months. Results: Of the 18 patients with high TEx (more than 24%), 11 were in CR or PR at follow-up with a SUVmax of 15.8 an, compared to an SUVmax of 10.7 for the 7 patients in PD or SD. Nine of the 21 patients with low TEX (less than 24%) were in PR or CR with an SUVmax of 4.9, significantly lower than the SUVmax of the 12 patients in PD or SD, 10.4. Conclusions: When associated with TEx, local glucose utilization measured by 18F-FDG may be of help for predicting systemic response to check inhibitor mono-therapy. Variations in local increased glucose consumption may reflect several pathophysiologic pathways including different concentrations of activated lymphocyte populations, non-homogenous melanocytic tumoral densities and local inflammatory cellular migrations.","title":"Correlation between local 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT and T cell exhaustion for predicting treatment response in patients with advanced melanoma treated with checkpoint inhibitor mono-therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_171302-176"}
