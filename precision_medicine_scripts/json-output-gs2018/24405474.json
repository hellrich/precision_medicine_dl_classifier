These patients were stratified into three groups: young (aged ≤ 55 years); middle-aged (aged ≧ 56 and ≤ 65 years); and elderly (aged ≧ 66 and ≤ 75 years). Their prognoses were analyzed both within age groups and according to whether or not there was metastasis.\nThe proportion of lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the young group than in the elderly group (P \u003d 0.007), and there were no significant differences in other factors among age groups. The overall survival rate at 5 years in the young group was significantly worse than that in the middle-aged and elderly groups (26.6%, 59.7% and 55.3%, respectively) in patients with stage IV disease with metastasis, although there was no difference among age groups in patients with stage IV disease without metastasis. Multivariate analysis showed that younger age was an independent strong prognostic factor in stage IV disease with metastasis.\nYoung men with metastatic prostate cancer have a poor prognosis. Young age is an independent prognostic factor in stage IV metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with primary androgen deprivation therapy.","title":"Prognostic impact of young age on stage IV prostate cancer treated with primary androgen deprivation therapy.","pubmedId":"24405474"}
