Hepatic resection seems to provide the only chance for therapeutic success. The records of 77 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated over a 28-year period were studied to determine demographics, clinical features, laboratory findings, diagnostic tests, operative management, and results of therapy. Survival was analyzed according to three treatment groups: conservative management, palliative operation, and hepatic resection. Conservative management was used for 15 patients, and hepatic resections were performed in 39 patients. The remaining 23 patients had laparotomy alone (10 patients), bile duct intubation (4 patients), hepatic artery ligation (3 patients), bilienteric bypass (3 patients), gastrojejunostomy (1 patient), insertion of a hepatic artery port for regional chemotherapy (1 patient), or open drainage of an abscess (1 patient). The median survival after conservative management, palliative operation, and hepatic resection were 1.8, 2.9, and, 12.2 months, respectively. After hepatic resection, patients without lymphatic permeation (p \u003c 0.02) or hilar nodal metastases (p \u003c 0.0003) survived significantly longer. We concluded that hepatic resection is indicated for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma when it is deemed resectable.","title":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"9015175"}
