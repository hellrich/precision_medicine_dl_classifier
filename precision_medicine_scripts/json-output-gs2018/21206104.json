PEComas of the pancreas are extremely rare neoplasms.\nWe describe a 49-year-old male who was incidentally diagnosed with a pancreatic mass. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy suggested a PEComa. An uneventful pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was thus performed. The tumor was a solid well-circumscribed mass in the pancreatic head with dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. Histopathology revealed a well-circumscribed and vascularized neoplasm, measuring 32x27x30 mm, composed of epithelioid smooth muscle cells with clear cytoplasm rich in glycogen. The tumor exhibited immunoreactivity to alpha-smooth muscle actin and to melanoma-associated antigen HMB-45.\nAlthough rare, pancreatic PEComas should be included in the differential diagnosis of a pancreatic mass. Currently, the paucity of cases published makes it impossible to predict the behavior and prognosis of these tumors or to advocate an optimal therapy.","title":"Asymptomatic pancreatic perivascular epithelial cell tumor (PEComa) in a male patient: report and literature review.","pubmedId":"21206104"}
