However, in relation to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, it is an indication of the rarity of the disease that only 2 reported cases exist in the literature. A 36-year-old male patient was admitted with the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma on the floor of the mouth. After the exclusion of distant metastatic disease, tumor surgery was performed. After a regular postoperative course over 3 days, the patient complained of progressive pain in the lower back. Extensive workup included position-emission tomography, which detected an enhancement of the bone marrow. Bone marrow biopsy elucidated advanced bone marrow carcinosis. Palliative chemotherapy was recommended, but the patient deteriorated rapidly and died from septic multiorgan failure within 6 weeks after surgery. Thus, bone marrow carcinosis must be considered in patients with head and neck tumor and osseous pain.","title":"Bone marrow carcinosis in head and neck carcinoma in a young adult.","pubmedId":"23351481"}
