We concurrently analyzed mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) genes, and investigated ALK rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization assay. ROS1 rearrangement was also determined in all triple (EGFR/KRAS/ALK)-negative tumors.\nOf 162 never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma, 14 (8.6%) and 5 (3.1%) had ALK and ROS1 rearrangements, respectively. Nineteen of the 74 (25.7%) EGFR and KRAS mutation-negative patients were fusion-positive (ALK or ROS1 fusion). Fusion-positive patients tended to have shorter median disease-free survival (DFS) than fusion-negative patients (28.0 vs. 33.9 months; p\u003d0.128). In multivariate analysis, fusion-positive patients had significantly poorer DFS than fusion-negative patients after adjustment for age, sex, T stage, N stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy use (p\u003d0.022; hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-4.30). The first recurrence sites were not significantly different between fusion-positive and fusion-negative patients in this study.\nThis study shows significantly poorer DFS of ALK or ROS1 fusion-positive lung adenocarcinoma in never-smokers after curative surgery.","title":"Clinical and prognostic implications of ALK and ROS1 rearrangements in never-smokers with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24462463"}
