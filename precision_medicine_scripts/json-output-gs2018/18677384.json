The morphologic characteristics were studied under light microscope, and essential immunohistochemical staininings (IHC) were performed and reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of S-ALCL. ALK-1 monoclonal antibody was used to assess ALK fusion protein expression, and EnVision method was used in IHC. Locus specific interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (LSI-FISH) was also performed on the neoplastic cells using paraffin-embedded tissues to detect ALK gene abnormality.\nALK-1 protein was expressed in 19 of the 28 cases. In 14 ALCL cases, ALK gene breakage was detected by LSI-FISH, using a dual-color break-apart ALK gene DNA (LSI-ALK) probe. Of the other 14 cases which did not show ALK gene breakage, 5 showed 2 copies of ALK gene as normal, and 9 showed multi-copies of ALK gene. Of all the 28 cases, 22 had complete follow-up materials. Sixteen survived and 6 died, their survival time ranged from 0.5 to 36.0 months, and the survival time on average was 12.8 months, cumulative proportion survival rate was 73.9% in the 1st year. Those cases showing multi-copies of ALK gene might have the worst outcome, with only 47.6% of cumulative proportion survival rate in the 1st year.\nIHC detection for ALK fusion protein is important to the diagnosis of S-ALCL. ALK gene breakage detected by interphase LSI-FISH might not be always consistent with abnormal expression of ALK fusion protein. Complex abnormalities of ALK gene exist in S-ALCL cases, and different types of ALK gene might lead to different clinical outcome. Those cases with multi-copies of ALK gene probably have the poorest prognosis.","title":"[Anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene abnormality and the expression of its fusion protein in primary systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma].","pubmedId":"18677384"}
