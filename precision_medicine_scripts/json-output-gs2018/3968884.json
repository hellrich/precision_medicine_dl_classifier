This is an important biological process of melanocytes that must not be confused with the acral-lentiginous (palmar-plantar-subungual-mucosal (P-S-M) melanoma. It is probably much more common than the paucity of published reports would indicate.","title":"Colonization of nonmelanocytic cutaneous lesions by dendritic melanocytic cells: a simulant of acral-lentiginous (palmar-plantar-subungual-mucosal) melanoma.","pubmedId":"3968884"}
