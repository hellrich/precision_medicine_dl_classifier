Four cases were synchronous MPCs, including one patient with synchronous triplicate primary cancer. Other 67 cases were heterochronous MPCs, including one patient with heterochronous triplicate primary cancer. Of 67 heterochronous MPCs, the time interval between index tumor presentation and diagnosis of MPCs was eight months to twelve years. MPCs occurred in seventy percent index oral cavity squamous cancers, which were located in head and neck regions, and in sixty-two percent index hypopharynx cancers and seventy-nine percent index laryngeal cancers, which were located in remote organs. The incidence of MPCs in esophagus and lung was higher than that in other remote organs. Among the various MPCs in this serials, the incidence of the disease appeared to be the highest in esophagus, accounting for twenty-four percent of all cases. The total three- and five-year survival rates were 32.4% and 22.5%, respectively. Of all MPCs patients, the three-year survival rate for patients who received different therapies for their MPCs was obviously higher than that of untreated patients (P \u003c 0.01, Chi-square test).\nEsophageal carcinoma is the most common second primary cancer among the various MPCs of the head and neck squamous carcinomas. Oral cavity cancers tend to have more MPCs in the head and neck regions, and laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers are easily to be associated with MPCs in the remote organs. Regular follow-up and early diagnosis with effective treatment can help to improve the survival of MPC patients in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.","title":"[Clinical analysis of 71 cases of multiple primary cancers in head and neck squamous carcinomas].","pubmedId":"15283285"}
