Since the impact of white blood cell count on outcome of subgroups defined by the molecular markers NPMc(+) and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) is unknown, we addressed this issue.\nWe studied the effect of white blood cell count on outcome in a clinically and molecularly well-defined cohort of 525 patients with acute myeloid leukemia using these molecular markers. In addition, since an increased white blood cell count has been associated with an increased FLT3-ITD/FLT3 (wild-type) ratio, we investigated whether the effect of white blood cell count on outcome could be explained by the FLT3-ITD/FLT3 ratio.\nThis analysis revealed that white blood cell count had no impact on outcome in patients with the genotypic combinations \u0027NPMc(+) without FLT3-ITD\u0027 and \u0027NPM1 wild-type with or without FLT3-ITD\u0027. In contrast, white blood cell count had a significant impact on complete remission rate (P\u003d0.034), event-free survival (P\u003d0.009) and overall survival (P\u003c0.001) in patients with the genotypic combination \u0027NPMc(+) with FLT3-ITD\u0027. A FLT3-ITD/FLT3 ratio greater than 1 was also associated with a reduced complete remission rate (P\u003d0.066) and significantly reduced event-free survival (P\u003d 0.001) and overall survival (P\u003d0.001) in patients with the genotypic combination \u0027NPMc(+) with FLT3-ITD\u0027. Multivariable analysis revealed that white blood cell count and FLT3-ITD/FLT3 ratio were independent prognostic indicators for outcome in the subgroup with the genotypic combination \u0027NPMc(+) with FLT3-ITD\u0027.\nOur results demonstrate that both high white blood cell count and FLT3-ITD/FLT3 ratio are prognostic factors in patients with acute myeloid leukemia with the genotypic combination \u0027NPMc(+) with FLT3-ITD\u0027.","title":"Prognostic impact of white blood cell count in intermediate risk acute myeloid leukemia: relevance of mutated NPM1 and FLT3-ITD.","pubmedId":"21606167"}
