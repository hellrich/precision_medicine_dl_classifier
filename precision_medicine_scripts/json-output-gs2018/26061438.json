In cases of CR, it is unclear whether BRAFi therapy should be continued. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course of patients with metastatic melanoma who discontinued BRAFi therapy after achieving a CR. In 12 patients, CR of metastatic melanoma was diagnosed after a median BRAFi treatment duration of 13 (range 0.3-32) months. Reasons for discontinuation were side effects in seven patients and patient demand in five patients. Six patients are still in CR after a median of 17 (range 2-26) months after discontinuation of BRAF inhibition. Six patients developed a melanoma recurrence after a median of 3 (range 2-17) months of discontinuation of BRAFi therapy. Subsequently, these patients were again treated with a BRAFi, which resulted in three CR, one stable disease, and one progressive disease; one patient could not be assessed. Melanoma patients achieving CR during BRAFi therapy represent a heterogeneous group. Discontinuation of BRAFi therapy after a CR has to be balanced carefully with the potential risk of nonresponding to BRAFi retreatment in the case of relapse.
