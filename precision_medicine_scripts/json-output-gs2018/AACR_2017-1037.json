Benign melanocytic nevi are nearly universal, and although progression of nevi to melanoma is very rare, 20-50% of melanoma appear to arise from a pre-existing nevus. UV exposure, particularly childhood sunburn, is believed to play an important role in the development of melanocytic nevi and melanoma, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Alterations in MAPK pathway genes, especially NRAS and BRAF, are common in both benign nevi and melanoma, but approximately 1/3 of melanomas do not have an identified driver mutation. Studying nevus initiation and progression prospectively in the human population is impractical due to the long latency to progression and repeated UV exposures Our laboratory has developed a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) genetically engineered mouse model with “humanized” junctional distribution of melanocytes on an iDCT-GFP background with melanocyte-specific GFP expression, allowing melanocytic lesions to be tracked through percutaneous GFP imaging. Following a single relevant dose of UV modeling childhood sunburn, HGF iDCT-GFP develop discrete, small melanocytic lesions consistent with nevi. Most nevi remain stable over the lifetime of the mouse, but around 1 in 30 progress to melanoma usually starting at 6-12 months. The melanocytic lesions are histologically similar to human nevi and melanoma, label with melanocyte markers and tumors are transplantable into syngeneic mice. Melanomas that arise in the model are heterogeneous and include radial growth phase and vertical growth phase tumors and sometimes metastasize to liver and lung. Exome sequencing of 28 nevi and melanomas show that vertical growth phase melanomas have approximately 3x more mutations than radial growth phase melanomas or nevi. The increased number of mutations in vertical growth phase tumors is due to an increase in C\u003eT transitions despite the lack of additional UV exposure. Interestingly, melanocytic nevi and melanomas with DNA repair pathway mutations average 3x more mutations than lesions without mutations in these pathways. Melanomas sometime contain mutations in hotspot locations from human melanomas, including GNAQ, but most do not have a previously identified dominant driver. Genes potentially involved in the initiation of melanocytic lesions or progression to aggressive melanomas and relevant to human melanoma have been identified and are being functionally tested using CRISPR to introduce point mutations or knock out genes and in vitro skin reconstitution assays. Identification of novel drivers and pathways involved in non-BRAF, non-NRAS melanoma has the potential to uncover biomarkers and new therapeutic targets to improve clinical outcomes for melanoma patients.","title":"Progression from melanocytic nevi to melanoma is associated with increased genomic mutations in a UV-induced mouse model of human melanoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-1037"}
