Dermoscopic examination of pigmented tumors improves the diagnostic accuracy in these challenging lesions. In these tumors, numerous comedolike openings are present.\nA 34-year-old man was seen for a conspicuous pigmented lesion on his back that clinically resembled a seborrheic keratosis because of the presence of multiple comedolike openings. Findings from dermoscopic examination showed distinct melanoma criteria (atypical pigmented network, asymmetric globules and dots, and a blue-whitish veil), in addition to multiple comedolike openings. Histopathological examination confirmed a peculiar melanoma variant characterized by prominent folliculotropism and minimal radial spreading. This tumor was not associated with chronic sun-damaged skin.\nDermoscopy was useful in identifying a particular case of seborrheic keratosislike melanoma with folliculotropism, thus avoiding incorrect treatment.","title":"Seborrheic keratosislike melanoma with folliculotropism.","pubmedId":"17372102"}
