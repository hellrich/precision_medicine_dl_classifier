The Apc gene knockout mice exhibit accelerated intestinal carcinogensis modifiable by diverse pharmacological agents. Present experiments utilized the Apc[+/-] 1638N COL colon epithelial cell line (origin: histologically normal colon) as the model. Retinoid receptor modulator 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO), and nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor sulindac (SUL) represented the chemopreventive test compounds. Population doubling, cell cycle progression, and anchorage-independent growth provided mechanistic end points for chemopreventive efficacy. Treatment of 1638N COL cells with 9-cis-RA, DFMO and SUL produced a dose-dependent cytostatic growth arrest by decreasing the number of population doublings and altering aneuploid G0/G1:S+G2/M ratio. The clonally expanded 1638N-Cl1 cells selected for anchorage-independent growth exhibited decreased anchorage-independent colony formation in response to treatment with the three test compounds. Susceptibility of preneoplastic 1638N COL cells to mechanistically distinct chemopreventive agents validates a unique epithelial cell culture model for FAP syndrome, and facilitates investigations on Apc regulated colon carcinogenesis and cancer prevention.","title":"Chemopreventive agents inhibit aberrant proliferation of the aneuploid phenotype in a colon epithelial cell line established from Apc 1638N [+/-] mouse.","pubmedId":"11795437"}
