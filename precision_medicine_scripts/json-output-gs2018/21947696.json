However, few studies have examined the role of these in prognosis and therapeutic sensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The efficacy of triple-drug combination therapy with docetaxel, fluorouracil and cisplatin has recently been expected for ESCC.\nSubjects comprised 142 patients with ESCC who underwent operation (OP group, n \u003d 54), neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel, fluorouracil, and cisplatin (DFP therapy) followed by operation (NAC group, n \u003d 37) or initial systemic DFP therapy (CT group, n \u003d 51) between January 2004 and December 2010. Immunohistochemical expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, HER3, Ki-67, and p53 were evaluated and compared with prognosis and sensitivity to DFP therapy.\nPositive correlations existed between EGFR, HER2, and HER3 expressions. In the OP group, EGFR was independently associated with postoperative recurrence in multivariate analysis (P \u003d .036). In the NAC group, EGFR correlated with pathological response to DFP therapy (P \u003d .004). In the CT group, EGFR, HER2, and HER3 correlated with clinical response to DFP therapy and EGFR was independently associated with favorable prognosis in multivariate analysis (P \u003d .022).\nEGFR represents a predictor of postoperative recurrence and sensitivity to triple-drug combination therapy including a taxane. EGFR-positive patients may show improved prognosis with taxane combination chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy for HER family members.","title":"Prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in patients positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor family can be improved by initial chemotherapy with docetaxel, fluorouracil, and cisplatin.","pubmedId":"21947696"}
