A CA repeat polymorphism in intron 1 of the EGFR gene influences the transcription of the EGFR gene. This study evaluates the association between the CA repeat polymorphism and outcome in NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib.\nNumber of CA repeats in the EGFR gene was evaluated with PCR-fragment length analysis by capillary electrophoresis in 432 advanced NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib irrespective of EGFR mutation status. Patients were dichotomized into harboring short allele (CA≤16 in any allele) or long alleles (CA\u003e16 in both alleles). Number of repeats was correlated with clinical characteristic and outcome. A subgroup analysis was performed based on the somatic EGFR mutation status.\nIn EGFR mutation positive patients (N\u003d62) we demonstrate a significantly higher median progression free survival (HR\u003d0.39 (0.22-0.70); p\u003d0.002) and overall survival (HR\u003d0.43 (0.23-0.78); p\u003d0.006) in patients also harboring a short CA repeat length vs. a long (median follow-up time of 52.2 months). The result remained highly significant in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. This correlation was not seen in EGFR mutation negative patients.\nOur study demonstrate that in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib a low number of CA repeats in intron 1 of the EGFR gene is a predictor for both longer progression free survival and overall survival.","title":"EGFR CA repeat polymorphism predict clinical outcome in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib.","pubmedId":"25017413"}
