Immunohistological demonstration of thyroglobulin in thyroidal or extrathyroidal tumours is of diagnostic value in confirming that the thyroid is the tissue of origin. Well differentiated tumours lacking thyroglobulin probably do not arise from thyroid epithelium.","title":"Diagnosis of primary thyroid carcinoma by immunohistological demonstration of thyroglobulin.","pubmedId":"381143"}
