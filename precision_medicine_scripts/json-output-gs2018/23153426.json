Currently, new prognostic and predictive biomarkers are sought after in order to more precisely define prognosis and better predict the benefits of adjuvant treatment in colorectal cancer. Besides several molecular biomarkers, such as mutations in the proto-oncogene K-ras, analyses of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes have shown promising prognostic value. The aim of the study is to examine the correlations between K-ras mutational status and tumour-infiltrating immune cells in colon cancer patients with respect to colon cancer recurrence.\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were obtained from 44 patients with surgically resected colon cancer (R0 resection) treated between 2004 and 2009. K-ras mutational status was detected using PCR amplification of exon 1 followed by direct sequencing and K-ras StripAssay. Tumour-infiltrating immune cells were detected by immunofluorescence staining using monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD8, FoxP3, CD1a and DC-LAMP.\nAll 44 patients in our cohort underwent radical resection of colon cancer. In 16 patients the tumour relapsed (36.4%). K-ras mutations were found in 45.5% (n\u003d20) of the primary carcinomas: 65% in codon 12 and 35% in codon 13. Although codon 13 K-ras mutations were associated with disease relapse, they were present in both disease-free and relapsed patients. However, disease-free and relapsed patients differed markedly in their patterns of tumour-infiltrating immune cells. There was a trend towards decreased density of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes within the group of relapsed patients. In addition, relapsed patients with codon 13 mutations had markedly lower levels of tumour-infiltrating mature DC-LAMP+ dendritic cells and higher frequency of CD1a+ cells compared to disease-free patients.\nColon cancer patients with low levels of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, a high CD1a+/DC-LAMP+ tumour-infiltrating DC ratio and a K-ras mutation in codon 13 are at a high risk of disease recurrence.","title":"[K-ras mutational status and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in human colon cancer: state of the art and future perspectives].","pubmedId":"23153426"}
