In this study, we describe a new epitope of this protein recognized in the context of HLA-Cw*0701 molecules by a CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) clone. This CD8+ TIL clone specifically recognized and killed a fraction of melanoma cells lines expressing Melan-A/MART1 and HLA-Cw*0701. We further show that the Melan-A/MART1(51-61) peptide is the optimal peptide recognized by this clone. Together, these data significantly enlarge the fraction of melanoma patients susceptible to benefit from a Melan-A/MART1 vaccine approach.","title":"A HLA-Cw*0701 restricted Melan-A/MART1 epitope presented by melanoma tumor cells to CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.","pubmedId":"18097665"}
