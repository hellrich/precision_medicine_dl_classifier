In 50% of patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors can be attributed to the development of a secondary T790M mutation that prevents drug binding. Third generation irreversible EGFR inhibitors that effectively inhibit EGFR with T790M are currently under clinical development. Using patient-derived EGFR mutant NSCLC models of T790M+ acquired resistance, we observed that the presence of a mesenchymal phenotype was associated with a decreased response to subsequent irreversible EGFR inhibitor therapy. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) led to suppression of pro-apoptotic signaling and a blunted apoptotic response to EGFR inhibition. Combination BCL-XL and irreversible EGFR inhibitor therapy restored the apoptotic response and resulted in regressions of T790M+ resistant tumors that exhibited poor response to single agent irreversible EGFR inhibitors. This suggests that combining BCL-XL and irreversible EGFR inhibitors may be an effective treatment strategy for T790M+ resistant EGFR mutant lung cancers with suppressed apoptotic signaling due co-acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype.","title":"Co-acquisition of T790M and EMT in resistant EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer can be overcome by combined irreversible EGFR and BCL-XL inhibition","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2845"}
