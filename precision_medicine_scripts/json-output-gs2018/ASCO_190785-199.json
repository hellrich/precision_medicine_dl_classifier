We have established that PD-L1 clones 22C3 and 28.8 show almost identical results. In this study we correlated between BRAF mutation and PD-L1 expression as detected by 22C3/28.8 and SP142 in melanoma clinical samples. Methods: Melanoma samples were tested for PD-L1 expression and BRAF mutation. IHC testing for PD-L1 22C3 or 28.8 were tested using FDA-approved kits as recommended. Testing with SP142 (Spring Biosciences; LDT) was performed using standard techniques. BRAF testing in combination with SP142 PD-L1 testing was performed using next generation sequencing covering exons 11 and 15. Samples tested with 22C3 and 28.8 clones were tested using FDA-cleared BRAF kits (Cobas, Therascreen) testing V600 only. Results: 68 samples were tested for PD-L1 expression with clone 22C3, 67 with 28.8, and 56 with SP142. There was no overall statistical difference between the three clones in PD-L1 expression (P \u003d 0.41). For combined 22C3 and 28.8, 61 of 135 cases (45%) had PD-L1 expression and 31 (23%) had BRAF mutation detected using FDA kits (V600). There was no statistical correlation between PD-L1 expression and BRAF mutation in this group (P \u003d 0.9) at any cut-off. In cases tested with SP142 clone, BRAF mutation was detected in 31 cases (55%) by NGS, higher than using the FDA kit (P \u003c 0.0001). In V600 mutations by NGS, 14 cases (25%) were positive, similar FDA kits. In SP142 cases, PD-L1 was positive in 45% of cases. There was no correlation between BRAF mutation and PD-L1 using SP142 expression as a continuous variable (P \u003d 0.59) or cut-off points of 5% or 50%. When cut-off of 20% was used, significant inverse correlation with BRAF mutation (P \u003d 0.004) was identified and was maintained if V600 codon only was evaluated. Conclusions: There is no correlation between BRAF mutation and PD-L1 expression as detected using clones 22C3 and 28.8. With SP142, a negative correlation between PD-L1 expression and BRAF mutation is identified with a 20% cut-off. The rate of BRAF mutations practically doubles when NGS is used and exons 11 and 15 are included in the testing, in contrast to FDA approved testing.","title":"BRAF mutation and PD-L1 expression in melanoma: Comparison between multiple PD-L1 IHC clones and BRAF mutation evalutated by FDA-approved kits versus NGS.","pubmedId":"ASCO_190785-199"}
