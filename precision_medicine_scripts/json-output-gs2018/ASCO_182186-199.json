Methods: Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of 92,784 clinically advanced malignancies was performed using a hybrid-capture, adaptor ligation based NGS assay to a mean coverage depth of \u003e600X. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was calculated from a minimum of 1.1 Mb of sequenced DNA. Results: 17,127/92,784 (18.5%) were NSCLC and 75,657 (81.5%) were non-NSCLC. Of the 697 (0.8%) of cases with ALK fusions, 554 (79%) were identified in NSCLC and 143 (21%) in non-NSCLC including 67 carcinomas; 39 sarcomas including 30 non-uterine and uterine leiomyosarcomas and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors; 24 in hematolymphoid malignancies including non-Hodgkins lymphomas, myelomas and histiocytic malignancies; 3 in gliomas; 2 each in mesotheliomas, neuroblastomas and undifferentiated malignancies and 1 in melanoma. ALK fusions were significantly more frequently identified in NSCLC (3.2%) than in non-NSCLC (p\u003c0.0001). The non-NSCLC ALK fusion positive patients were significantly older (p\u003c0.0001) and more often female (p\u003c0.0001) than the NSCLC ALK fusion positive patients. At 84%, the more frequent finding of EML4 as the fusion partner in the NSCLC patients versus non-NSCLC patients at 31% was significant (p\u003c0.0001). ALK fusion positive non-NSCLC had significantly lower TMB (mean 5.01 mutations/Mb) than non-ALK altered non-NSCLC (p\u003d0.006). Non-NSCLC ALKfusion positive cases responding to ALK inhibitors will be presented. Conclusions: In non-NSCLC patients ALK fusions are rare and found in both epithelial and mesenchymal malignancies. Initial evidence strongly suggests that anti-ALK therapies can be effective in ALK fusion driven non-NSCLC .","title":"Occurrence of ALK fusions in cancers other than non-small cell lung cancer in a wide variety of tumor types and response to anti-ALK targeted therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_182186-199"}
