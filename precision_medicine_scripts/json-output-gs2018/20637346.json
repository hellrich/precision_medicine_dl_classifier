Novel molecular testing on cytological material could lead to clearer treatment algorithms. B-Raf(V600E) mutation is the most common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer, specifically found in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and usually reported to be associated with aggressive disease.\nA literature search using PubMed identified all the pertinent literature on the identification and utilization of the B-Raf(V600E) mutation in thyroid cancer.\nThe utility of using B-Raf mutation testing for nodules with indeterminate cytology is limited since many of those nodules (benign and malignant) do not harbor B-Raf mutations. However, when the pathologist sees cytological features suspicious for PTC, B-Raf(V600E) mutation analysis may enhance the assessment of preoperative risks for PTC, directing a more aggressive initial surgical management when appropriate.","title":"Surgical implications of B-RafV600E mutation in fine-needle aspiration of thyroid nodules.","pubmedId":"20637346"}
