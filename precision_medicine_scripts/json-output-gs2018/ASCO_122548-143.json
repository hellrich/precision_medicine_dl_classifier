JCO 2010).  Recently, analysis from 1st-line mCRC PRIME study showed that mutations in RAS genes (KRAS/NRAS exons 2/3/4) predicted a lack of response to pmab (Douillard et al. NEJM 2013).   Methods:  The primary objective was to assess the tx effect of pmab + FOLFIRI vs FOLFIRI on OS and PFS based on RAS mutation status in the primary analysis population.  Bidirectional Sanger sequencing was used to detect mutations in KRAS exons 3, 4 and NRAS exons 2, 3, 4 in patients (pts) with known WT KRAS exon 2 mCRC.  Results:  In this prospective retrospective analysis, overall RAS ascertainment rate was 85% (n\u003d1008/1186).  18% of the WT KRAS exon 2 pts harbored additional RAS mutations (n\u003d107/597).  Efficacy is shown (Table).  Tx HR for pts with WT RAS was 0.803 (95% CI: 0.629-1.024; P\u003d0.077) for OS and 0.695 (95% CI: 0.536-0.903; P\u003d0.006) for PFS.   Conclusions:  Improvements were observed in the tx effect of pmab + FOLFIRI vs FOLFIRI on OS and PFS in the WT RAS group vs the WT KRAS exon 2 group.  Pts with MT RAS mCRC are unlikely to benefit by the addition of pmab to FOLFIRI, similar to pts with MT KRAS exon 2 mCRC in this study.  These findings are consistent with previously reported outcomes by RAS status and support RAS testing to determine potentially appropriate pts for pmab tx.
