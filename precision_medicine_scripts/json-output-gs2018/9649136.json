Here, we examined the effects of wild-type and mutated p53 (143 Val-Ala) on tumorigenic and metastatic potential of two human melanoma cell lines. The cell line UISO-MEL-4 contains wild-type p53 and is tumorigenic, whereas UISO-MEL-6 lacks p53 and produces lung and liver metastasis upon s.c. injection into athymic mice. Our study showed that UISO-MEL-4 stably transfected with wild-type p53 cDNA driven by cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer sequences expressed high levels of p53 and p21 and formed s.c. tumours in vivo. Mutated p53 (143 Val-Ala) expression, on the other hand, inhibited tumour growth in 50% of cases and produced significantly slower growing non-metastatic tumours. Reduced tumour growth involved necrotic as well as apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of tumour growth was abrogated by the addition of Matrigel (15 mg ml(-1)). With UISO-MEL-6 cells, stably transfected with mutant p53, tumour growth was delayed and metastasis was inhibited. In soft agar colony formation assay, both wild-type and mutant p53 transfectants reduced anchorage-independent colony formation in vitro. These data suggest that mutated (143 Val-Ala) p53, which retains DNA binding and some of the transactivation functions of the wild-type p53 protein, suppresses tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of human melanoma cell lines in vivo.","title":"Suppression of tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of human melanoma cell lines by mutated (143 Val-Ala) p53.","pubmedId":"9649136"}
