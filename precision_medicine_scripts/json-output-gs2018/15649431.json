This study demonstrated that two major natural lysophospholipids, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), induce rapid and transient phosphorylation of HER2 in two human gastric cancer cell lines, MKN28 and MKN74 cells. We also revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 induced by both lysophospholipids was significantly attenuated by two inhibitors, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478, and a broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, GM6001. This suggests that the pathway of HER2 transactivation induced by these lysophospholipids is dependent on the proteolytically released EGFR ligands. Our results indicate that LPA and S1P act upstream of HER2 in gastric cancer cells, and thus may act as potent stimulators of gastric cancer.","title":"Lysophospholipids transactivate HER2/neu (erbB-2) in human gastric cancer cells.","pubmedId":"15649431"}
