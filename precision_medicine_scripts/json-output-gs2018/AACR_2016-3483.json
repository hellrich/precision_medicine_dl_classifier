However, clinical and pathologic roles of these hormone receptor genes have not been clearly established in thyroid cancer.Materials and methodsTo evaluate the relationship between sex hormone receptor gene expressions and clinicopathologic variables, we analyzed ESR1, ESR2, ESR ratio (ESR1/ESR2) and PGR mRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA sequencing experiment in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). To validate results from TCGA analysis, we additionally analyzed a public microarray data (GSE 54598) from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database.ResultsIn TCGA data analysis, ESR1, ESR ratio and PGR expression were significantly higher in PTC tissue than in normal thyroid tissue (Mean value of normal versus tumor were 264.045 vs 659.427 in ESR1, 19.064 vs 92,017 in ESR ratio and 58.514 vs 119.792 in PGR, respectively). In female patients, ESR1 and ESR ratio was negatively correlated with advanced age (t-value was -2.257 and -2.949 in linear regression analysis). Expression of ESR1 and ESR ratio were higher in classic type PTC, presentation of lymphovascular invasion and BRAF V600E mutation. Higher expression group of ESR1 and ESR ratio showed worse overall survival in female PTC patients (Hazard ratio was 6.348 in ESR1 and 4.031 in ESR ratio, respectively). In microarray analysis, ESR1 and ESR ratio expressions were higher in tumor than normal, classic than follicular variant and BRAF V600E than wild type.ConclusionExpression of ESR1 and ESR ratio were associated with aggressive prognostic factors and worse overall survival in female PTC patients. These results suggest that higher expression of ESR1 and ESR ratio can be used as prognostic markers to predict survival in female patients.","title":"ESR1 gene expression and expression ratio of ESR1 to ESR2 are associated with worse prognosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3483"}
