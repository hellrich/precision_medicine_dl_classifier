Up-regulation of growth factor receptor such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) or insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) is among the mechanisms underlying BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. Here we demonstrate for the first time that up-regulation of PDGFR, a growth factor receptor which markedly differs in its functional properties from its family member PDGFR, causes BRAF-I resistance in vitro and in vivo. PDGFR inhibition by PDGFR-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNAs) and by clinically available PDGFR inhibitors (sunitinib, imatinib and crenolanib) restores and increases melanoma cells\u0027 sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. This effect reflects the inhibition of ERK and AKT activation which is associated with BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. PDGFR up-regulation is mediated by Sonic Hedgehog Homolog (Shh) pathway activation which is induced by BRAF-I treatment. Similarly to PDGFR inhibition, Shh inhibition by the novel small molecule LDE225 restores and increases melanoma cells\u0027 sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. These effects are mediated by PDGFR down-regulation and by inhibition of ERK and AKT activation. The clinical relevance of these data is indicated by the association of PDGFR up-regulation in melanoma matched biopsies of BRAF-I +/- MEK inhibitor treated patients with shorter time to disease progression and less tumor regression. These findings suggest that monitoring patients for early PDGFR up-regulation will facilitate the identification of those who may benefit from the treatment with BRAF-I in combination with clinically approved PDGFR or Shh inhibitors","title":"PDGFR up-regulation mediated by Sonic Hedgehog Pathway activation leads to BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma cells with BRAF mutation","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3703"}
