Acute erythroid leukemia is characterized by a predominant erythroid proliferation, and in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme there are 2 subtypes: erythroleukemia (erythroid/myeloid leukemia) and pure erythroid leukemia. Morphologic findings are most important for establishing the diagnosis. The erythroleukemia subtype, which is most common, is defined as the presence of 50% or more erythroid precursors and 20% or more blasts in the nonerythroid component. The pure erythroid leukemia subtype is composed of 80% or more immature erythroblasts. Although these morphologic criteria appear straightforward, AEL overlaps with other types of AML and myelodysplastic syndrome that are erythroid rich.\nTo provide an update of AEL, including clinical presentation, morphologic features, immunophenotype, and cytogenetic and molecular data. As the erythroleukemia subtype is most common, the literature and this review are biased towards this subtype of AEL.\nClinicopathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular information were extracted from our review of pertinent literature and a subset of AEL cases in the files of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston) and University of South Alabama (Mobile).\nThe current WHO criteria for establishing the diagnosis of AEL reduce the frequency of this entity, as cases once classified as the erythroleukemia subtype are now reclassified as other types of AML, particularly AML with myelodysplasia-related changes and therapy-related AML. This reclassification also may have prognostic significance for patients with the erythroleukemia subtype of AEL. In contrast, the current WHO criteria appear to have little impact on the frequency and poor prognosis of patients with the pure erythroid leukemia subtype of AEL. Molecular studies, preferably using high-throughput methods, are needed for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AEL, and for developing diagnostic and prognostic markers.","title":"Acute erythroid leukemia.","pubmedId":"20807044"}
