In both types of melanoma, a marked synergistic effect of the combined therapy was noted. Particularly in C24 melanoma a reduction in the size of tumor was observed. Histopathologic findings revealed a strong degeneration such as destruction of the tumor structure and vacuolization of nuclei.","title":"Thermochemotherapy for malignant melanoma: combination therapy of ACNU and hyperthermia in mice.","pubmedId":"6582171"}
