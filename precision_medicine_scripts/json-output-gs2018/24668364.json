Despite the effectiveness of trastuzumab, resistance is common. Thus, there is an urgent need to overcome trastuzumab resistance. Here, we obtain a trastuzumab-resistant cell line, which is derived from the human gastric cancer NCI-N87 cell line, by modeling the development of acquired resistance in patients. Our data show that combining trastuzumab and cetuximab leads to a significant decrease in EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers and signaling compared with either antibody alone, and the combination results in greater antitumor activity against the trastuzumab-resistant NCI-N87 cell line, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that a combined EGFR/ErbB2 inhibition may overcome trastuzumab resistance.
