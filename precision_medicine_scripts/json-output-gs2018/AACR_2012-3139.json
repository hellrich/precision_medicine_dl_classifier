Here, we demonstrated that NGB expression was frequently down-regulated in human lung cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Furthermore, we found hypermethylation in NGB promoter region. Treatment with trichostatin A (TSA) and 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) restored NGB expression. In addition, the reintroduction of NGB into the cells, in which it is downregulated, represses cell growth, colony formation, angiogenesis and tumor growth in nude mouse. These findings indicate that NGB is a putative tumor suppressor gene in lung cancer and could play a pivotal role in lung carcinogenesis.","title":"Frequent downregulation of NGB/GTPBP in lung cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-3139"}
