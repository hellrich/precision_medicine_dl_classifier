The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib has improved survival and is now considered the standard of care; however, the benefits are still disappointing, and thus, new effective treatments are required. In human hepatocellular carcinoma, MET, which is encoded by the HGFR gene, is activated by amplification, overexpression or mutation, and it has recently emerged as a possible therapeutic target in various tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, some drugs targeting the HGF/MET axis are currently under investigation in clinical trials. Here, we review the role of MET and trends in the development of MET inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma.
