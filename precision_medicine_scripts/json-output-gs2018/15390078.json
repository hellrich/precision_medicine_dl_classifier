To avoid the genetic complexities associated with established breast cancer cell lines, we employed NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts engineered to overexpress human Her-2/neu coding sequence. NIH-3T3/Her-2 cells demonstrated a significant upregulation of FAS protein expression, which was dependent on the upstream activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3\u0027-kinase/AKT pathways. Remarkably, pharmacological FAS blockade using the mycotoxin cerulenin or the novel small compound C75 completely suppressed the state of Her-2/neu-induced malignant transformation by inhibiting the ability of NIH-3T3/Her-2 cells to grow under either anchorage-independent (i.e., to form colonies in soft agar) or low-serum monolayer conditions. Moreover, NIH-3T3/Her-2 fibroblasts were up to three times more sensitive to chemical FAS inhibitors relative to untransformed controls as determined by MTT-based cell viability assays. In addition, pharmacological FAS blockade preferentially induced apoptotic cell death of NIH-3T3/Her-2 fibroblasts, as determined by an ELISA for histone-associated DNA fragments and by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated nick end labeling assay (TUNEL). Interestingly, the degree of Her-2/neu oncogene expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines was predictive of sensitivity to chemical FAS inhibitors-induced cytotoxicity, while low-FAS expressing and chemical FAS inhibitors-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells became hypersensitive to FAS blockade when they were engineered to overexpress Her-2/neu. Our observations strongly suggest that inhibition of FAS activity may provide a new molecular avenue for chemotherapeutic prevention and/or treatment of Her-2/neu-related breast carcinomas.","title":"Pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FAS): a novel therapeutic approach for breast cancer chemoprevention through its ability to suppress Her-2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene-induced malignant transformation.","pubmedId":"15390078"}
