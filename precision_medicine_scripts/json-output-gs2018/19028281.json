Here, we examined the possible mechanisms underlying skin response to radiation in F1 progeny of Ptch1(neo67/+) mice crossed with either skin tumor-susceptible (Car-S) or -resistant (Car-R) mice and X-irradiated (3 Gy) at 2 days of age or left untreated.\nWe conducted a gene expression profile analysis in mRNA samples extracted from the skin of irradiated or control mice, using Affymetrix whole mouse genome expression array. Confirmation of the results was done using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.\nAnalysis of the gene expression profile of normal skin of F1 mice at 4 weeks of age revealed a similar basal profile in the nonirradiated mice, but alterations in levels of 71 transcripts in irradiated Ptch1(neo67/+) mice of the Car-R cross and modulation of only eight genes in irradiated Ptch1(neo67/+) mice of the Car-S cross.\nThese results indicate that neonatal irradiation causes a persistent change in the gene expression profile of the skin. The tendency of mice genetically resistant to skin tumorigenesis to show a more complex pattern of transcriptional response to radiation than do genetically susceptible mice suggests a role for this response in genetic resistance to basal cell tumorigenesis.","title":"Genetic background modulates gene expression profile induced by skin irradiation in ptch1 mice.","pubmedId":"19028281"}
