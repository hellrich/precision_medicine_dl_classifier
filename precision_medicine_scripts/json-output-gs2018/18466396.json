However, little is known about the localization of APE-1 in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosa or its role in the development of gastric cancer. To investigate the role of APE-1 in the development of gastric cancer, we examined APE-1 expression and localization in cultured cells and gastric biopsies from patients with H. pylori-infected gastritis or gastric adenoma, and from surgically resected gastric cancer.\nAPE-1 mRNA and protein expression were determined in H. pylori (CagA+) water-extract protein (HPWEP)-stimulated MKN-28 cells, gastric adenocarcinoma cell-line (AGS) cells, and human peripheral macrophages by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. APE-1 expression and 8-OHdG as a measure of oxidative DNA damage were evaluated by immunostaining. Localization of APE-1 and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation in gastric adenoma and gastric cancer tissues were evaluated by single- and double-label immunohistochemistry.\nIn studies in vitro, HPWEP-stimulation significantly increased APE-1 mRNA expression levels in both MKN-28 cells and human peripheral macrophages. Hypo/reoxygenation treatment significantly increased APE-1 protein expression in HPWEP-stimulated MKN-28 cells. HPWEP stimulation significantly increased both APE-1 expression and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation levels in MKN-28 and AGS cells. In human tissues, APE-1 expression in H. pylori-infected gastritis without goblet cell metaplasia was significantly increased as compared to that in tissues from uninfected subjects. Eradication therapy significantly reduced both APE-1 and 8-OHdG expression levels in the gastric mucosa. APE-1 expression was mainly localized in epithelial cells within gastric adenoma and in mesenchymal cells of gastric cancer tissues. APE-1 expression in gastric cancer tissues was significantly reduced compared to that in H. pylori-infected gastric adenoma, while 8-OHdG index and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation levels did not differ between these two neoplastic tissue types. Co-localization of APE-1 and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation was observed not in gastric cancer cells but in gastric adenoma cells.\nH. pylori infection is associated with increased APE-1 expression in human cell lines and in gastric tissues from subjects with gastritis and gastric adenomas. The observed distinct expression patterns of APE-1 and 8-OHdG in gastric adenoma and gastric cancer tissues may provide insight into the progression of these conditions and warrants further investigation.","title":"Expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-1 (APE-1) in H. pylori-associated gastritis, gastric adenoma, and gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"18466396"}
