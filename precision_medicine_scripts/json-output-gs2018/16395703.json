In Poland, there is a common variant of the CDKN2A: an alanine to threonine substitution (A148T), which has been detected in other populations. We have recently showed that it is significantly overrepresented among Polish melanoma patients when compared to general population. Herein, we ascertained the prevalence of the A148T variant in 3,583 unselected cancer cases and 3,000 random control subjects from the same Polish population. We evaluated eleven different malignancies, representing the majority of all common cancer sites. Positive association with A148T variant was observed for lung cancer (OR, 2.0; p \u003d 0.0052). A similar trend, although nonsignificant after the Bonferroni correction, was observed for colorectal cancer (OR, 1.5; p \u003d 0.5499). These results suggest that A148T variant may be associated with a multi-organ cancer risk in the Polish population.","title":"CDKN2A common variant and multi-organ cancer risk--a population-based study.","pubmedId":"16395703"}
