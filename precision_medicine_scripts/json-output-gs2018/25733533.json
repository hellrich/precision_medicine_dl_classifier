Collagen I in the extracellular matrix promotes the migration and invasion of tumor cells through the production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9. Discoidin domain receptor (DDR) 2 is a collagen receptor that is implicated in several cancer types including breast and prostate cancers. However, the role of DDR2 in the migration and invasion of murine melanoma cells is less studied. In the present study, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of DDR2 in migration and invasion of B16BL6 melanoma cells in response to collagen I. Results demonstrated that DDR2 is expressed and is phosphorylated by collagen I in the cells. Upon down-regulation of DDR2 using small-interfering RNA (siRNA) approach, both of the cell migratory and invasive phenotypes were significantly attenuated when compared with the control cells. This effect was mediated via suppression of MMP2/9 upon DDR2 inhibition. Furthermore, inhibition of DDR2 by specific siRNA markedly reduced the activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2 and nuclear factor of kappa B (NF-κB) in the cells when compared with the control cells. Overall, these data demonstrated that DDR2 siRNA-mediated suppression of ERK1/2 and NF-κB could down-regulate the expressions of MMP2/9 in response to collagen I to reduce the migratory and invasive phenotypes of the cells.","title":"DDR2 inhibition reduces migration and invasion of murine metastatic melanoma cells by suppressing MMP2/9 expression through ERK/NF-κB pathway.","pubmedId":"25733533"}
