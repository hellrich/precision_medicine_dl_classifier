Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are involved in the pathogenesis of familial MTC and \u003e50% of the sporadic cases. Currently, there is no effective treatment for recurrent or metastatic MTC. We report here a rapid response to a sorafenib (RET and RAF kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor)--based regimen in a patient with sporadic MTC who had advanced, progressive disease and a novel RET kinase aberration at exon 11 shown in tumor tissue.","title":"Medullary thyroid cancer: targeting the RET kinase pathway with sorafenib/tipifarnib.","pubmedId":"18445656"}
