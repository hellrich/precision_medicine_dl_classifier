This review examines some of these data and attempts to discuss whether these analyses will have clinical applications in diagnosis, prediction of prognosis and response to therapy, disease classification, or individually targeted therapy. It is probable that all these areas will reach the clinical environment eventually, but in the short to medium term, microarrays will be involved only in diagnosis.","title":"Clinical implications of gene expression profiling of acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"20425341"}
