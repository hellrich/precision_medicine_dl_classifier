The presumed molecular basis of this resistance is the effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and other cytokines on endothelial adhesion molecule expression. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules correlate in AML.\nBaseline serum levels of 17 cytokines and 5 soluble adhesion molecules were measured in 53 AML patients using biochip array technology. Age, leukocyte count, secondary AML, CRP, FLT3-ITD and remission were variables. Statistical analysis was performed in R version 3.1.2.\nVCAM-1 correlated with ICAM-1 (P \u003c 0.0001), E-selectin (P \u003c 0.0001), leukocyte count (P \u003d 0.0005) and TNF-α (P \u003d 0.0035). E-selectin correlated with leukocyte count (P \u003c 0.0001), P-selectin (P \u003d 0.0032) and MCP-1 (P \u003d 0.0119). CRP correlated with IL-6 (P \u003c 0.0001), leukocyte count negatively correlated with IL-7 (P \u003d 0.0318). FLT3-ITD was associated with higher E-selectin (P \u003d 0.0010) and lower IL-7 (P \u003d 0.0252). Secondary AML patients were older. Failure of induction therapy was associated with significantly higher CRP and lower P-selectin. Leukocyte count (P \u003c 0.0001), FLT3-ITD (P \u003d 0.0017) and secondary AML (P \u003d 0.0439) influenced the principal component.\nLeukemic cells can modulate the microenvironment. Cytokine, adhesion molecule levels and leukocyte count correlate in AML. Understanding these mechanisms may form the basis of novel therapeutic approaches.","title":"Evaluation of cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia: the role of TNF-alpha and FLT3-ITD.","pubmedId":"26365931"}
