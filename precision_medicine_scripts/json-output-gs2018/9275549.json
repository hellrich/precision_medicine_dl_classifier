The number and type of gene alteration were different among individuals. Rearrangement of c-met was noted in 2/33 cases (6%), and amplification of c-met, c-erbB-2 and AKT-2 in 8/33 cases (24.2%), 1/33 cases (3%) and 2/18 cases (11%) respectively. Homozygous deletion of P16 was seen in 6/33 cases (18%). Loss of heterozygousity was also noted in nm23-H1 5/17 (29%) and p53 2/13 (16%). The mutation rate of p53 in exon 5-8 was 20/33 (61%). Point mutation of p53 was found at both early and advanced tumors. In contrast, amplification of oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressor genes were correlated with poorly differentiated and metastatic tumors.\nGastric carcinogenesis is a gradually developed process, results from sequencial alteration of multigenes. The malignant phenotype is associated with the degree of genetic abnormality.","title":"[Correlation of multiple gene changes with malignant phenotype of human gastric carcinoma].","pubmedId":"9275549"}
