The findings of these studies have indicated the presence of rare, high-penetrance alleles with large effects, such as CDKN2A and CDK4, more common, moderately penetrant genes like MC1R, and very common, low-penetrance polymorphisms with small effects that are related to pigmentation, nevus count, immune responses, DNA repair, metabolism, and the vitamin D receptor. The study of these low-penetrance single nucleotide polymorphisms is relatively new; thus many of them are termed \u0027candidate melanoma susceptibility or prognostic genes.\u0027 This review summarizes the research on germline polymorphisms that have been implicated in melanoma susceptibility and prognosis in order to provide a framework for additional studies to meet the ultimate goal of predicting a patient\u0027s risk of, and prognosis in, cutaneous malignant melanoma.","title":"Germline melanoma susceptibility and prognostic genes: a review of the literature.","pubmedId":"22583682"}
