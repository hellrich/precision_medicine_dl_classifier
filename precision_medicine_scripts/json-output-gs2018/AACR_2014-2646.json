{"genes":["dolastatin","auristatin","dolastatin 10"],"publicationTypes":["2014 AACR Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"A family of novel warheads derived from dolastatins or auristatins were designed and synthesized. They showed similar or better antitumor activities against several typical cancer cell lines compared with dolastatin 10 or monomethylauristatin E or F. The conjugated ADCs with Trastuzumab have showed potent activities against Her2 breast cancer cell lines. The validated platform with novel cytotoxins can be potentially used to ADCs discovery and development.","title":"Building a powerful ADCs discovery and development platform with novel dolastatin/auristatin payloads","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2646"}
