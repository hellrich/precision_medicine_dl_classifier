A substitution of an aspartate for a valine at position 816 (D816V) is one of the most commonly found oncogenic c-Kit mutation and is found in more than 90% of cases of mastocytosis and in a subgroup of germ cell tumors, core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia and mucosal melanomas. Previous studies have shown that the D816V mutation causes a structural change in the activation loop resulting in weaker binding of the activation loop to the juxtamembrane domain, leading to a release of the negative constraint it poses on kinase activity. Here we have investigated the role of Y823 in the activation loop of c-Kit and its role in oncogenic transformation by c-Kit/D816V. Although dispensable for the kinase activity of c-Kit/D816V, the presence of Y823 was shown to be crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, mutation of Y823 selectively down-regulated the Ras/Erk and Akt pathways. It also led to decreased phosphorylation of STAT5 and reduced the transforming capacity of D816V/c-Kit in vitro. The sensitivity to kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib and nilotinib, was decreased in cells expressing c-Kit/Y823F/D816V compared to cells c-Kit/D816V. Mice injected with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V/Y823F displayed significantly reduced tumor size as well as tumor weight compared to controls. Finally, microarray array analysis, comparing c-Kit/Y823F/D816V cells with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V, demonstrate that mutation of Y823 causes up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes whereas genes of survival pathways are down-regulated. Thus, phosphorylation of Y823 is not necessary for kinase activation, but essential for the transforming ability of the c-Kit/D816V mutant.","title":"Tyrosine 823 in the activation loop of c-Kit regulates the transforming capacity of the oncogenic mutant D816V and its sensitivity to kinase inhibitors","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-128"}
