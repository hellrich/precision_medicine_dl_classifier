As BRAF may be an attractive therapeutic target, it is crucial to have a sensitive method for detecting mutated DNA in biological samples. Our aim was to investigate COLD-PCR (co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR) as a new approach for the pre-analytical enrichment of the BRAFV600E variant in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) melanoma tissues.\nCOLD-PCR was used to selectively amplify BRAFV600E minority alleles from mixtures of wild-type and mutated sequences, and from biological samples. The method shows higher specificity than other conventional PCR-based methods in detecting somatic mutations.\nWe used COLD-PCR to increase the theoretical sensitivity of three different post-PCR methods: sequencing, pyrosequencing and HRMA. The gain in sensitivity seems to be more evident for HRMA, which allows the detection of 3.1% mutated alleles. More than 20% of patients initially classified negative for BRAFV600E were found positive after COLD-PCR.\nCOLD-PCR was confirmed as a suitable method for the enrichment of mutated alleles, particularly for samples in which the percentage of tumor cells is very low.","title":"BRAFV600E detection in melanoma is highly improved by COLD-PCR.","pubmedId":"21262211"}
