DNA from 237 CM patients seen at the University of Campinas Teaching Hospital from April 2000 to February 2014 was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. The prognostic impact of genotypes of polymorphisms on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of CM patients were examined using the Kaplan-Meier probability estimates and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. At 60 months of follow-up, shorter PFS and OS were seen in patients with XPF CC genotype (48.9 vs. 66.7 %, P \u003d 0.002; 77.9 vs. 83.5 %, P \u003d 0.006, respectively) and XPF CC + TP53 ArgArg (43.6 vs. 65.9 %, P \u003d 0.007; 71.6 vs. 84.8 %, P \u003d 0.006, respectively) compared with those with remaining genotypes (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Patients with XPF CC (hazard ratio (HR) 2.45, P \u003d 0.002; HR 3.77, P \u003d 0.005) and XPF CC + TP53 ArgArg (HR 2.67, P \u003d 0.009; HR 4.04, P \u003d 0.03) genotypes had more chance to present tumor progression in univariate and multivariate analyses, whereas patients with XPF CC (HR 2.78, P \u003d 0.009) and XPF CC + TP53 ArgArg (HR 3.84, P \u003d 0.01) genotypes were under greater risk of progressing to death in univariate analysis, compared with those with the remaining genotypes. The data suggest, for the first time, that inherited abnormalities in DNA repair pathway related to XPF 30028C and TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphisms act as prognostic factors for PFS and OS of CM patients.
