We report a keratoacanthoma arising in a recent tattoo. A 60-year-old woman presented with a tumor on her right leg, over an area of red pigment in a professional tattoo. Histological analysis confirmed the clinical diagnosis of keratoacanthoma. Although the association between malignancy and tattoos is very uncommon dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons should be attentive to this possibility.","title":"Keratoacanthoma in a tattoo.","pubmedId":"19903437"}
