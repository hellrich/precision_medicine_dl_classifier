The introduction of these compounds into clinical practice has transformed the treatment of metastatic MTC and provided insight into the mechanisms by which RET causes C-cell transformation. This chapter will review the progress in this field over the past 7 years.","title":"Use of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors for Treatment of Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26494392"}
