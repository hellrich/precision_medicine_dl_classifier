Baseline conventional imaging, including computed tomography (neck, chest, abdomen, Â± pelvis, adrenals), magnetic resonance imaging (neck), and bone scan, was performed on all patients.\nSRS results were compared with conventional imaging.\nFive of the 11 patients had abnormal findings on SRS. Of the 53 total target lesions present in the patients, only 24.5% were accurately identified through SRS.\nSRS appears to be less sensitive than conventional imaging at detecting the full extent of metastatic disease in children and adolescents with hereditary MTC. SRS incompletely identified sites of tumor and failed to visualize small sites of tumor or liver and lung metastases, and it has a limited role in the evaluation of metastatic disease in pediatric MTC patients.","title":"(111)In-octreotide scintigraphy for identification of metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma in children and adolescents.","pubmedId":"22162469"}
