The clinical benefit afforded by these treatments can be accompanied by a unique spectrum of adverse events, called immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which reflect the drug\u0027s immune-based mechanism of action. IrAEs typically originate in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and endocrine system, although other organ systems may also be affected. This article provides an overview of irAEs associated with anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) as monotherapy or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibition (ipilimumab), followed by a discussion of irAEs of special clinical interest based on the potential for morbidity, frequent steroid use, and inpatient admission. We review clinical trial data and provide recommendations on how to manage irAEs associated with anti-PD-1 agents based on clinical experience and established management guidelines. We further illustrate the practical considerations of managing irAEs by presenting three cases of immune-related toxicity in melanoma patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. A better understanding of the identification and management of irAEs will help inform health care providers about the risks associated with anti-PD-1 treatment, to ensure the safe and appropriate use of these important new treatments.\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefit in advanced melanoma and other tumor types. These treatments are associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which most commonly affect the skin and gastrointestinal tract, and, to a lesser extent, the liver, endocrine system, and other organs. This review focuses on the management of irAEs after treatment with anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) as monotherapy or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibition (ipilimumab) in patients with advanced melanoma. A better understanding of the management of irAEs will help ensure the safe and appropriate use of anti-PD-1 agents in melanoma and other tumor types.","title":"Management of Adverse Events Following Treatment With Anti-Programmed Death-1 Agents.","pubmedId":"27401894"}
