Saline implants, silicone implants, and autologous fat injections are the most common options. The inframammary, periareolar, and axillary routes with or without endoscopy are the most common routes of implantation. The subpectoral dual-plane and the subglandular plane are the most common pockets. The most common complications are capsular contracture for implants and volume loss for injected fat. Breast augmentation does not appear to increase breast cancer risk or survival rates.","title":"Breast augmentation.","pubmedId":"21093748"}
