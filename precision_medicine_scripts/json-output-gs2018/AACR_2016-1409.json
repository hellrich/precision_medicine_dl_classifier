More importantly, the toxicity and financial burden of receiving such therapy warrants a personalized, or precision medicine, approach to appropriate selection of treatment, thus molecular predictors of response may become as important as biomarkers such as PDL1 expression. Recently the high mutational burden of malignant melanoma was shown to be related to the degree of response to the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab, but mutational burden alone was not sufficient to predict benefit1. Another study has shown NRAS-mutant had a trend to superior outcomes compared with other cohorts in terms of response to therapy with anti-PD1 antibodies and progression-free survival2. Moreover, insight into the molecular evolution of melanoma was recently established3, wherein somatic mutations in oncogenes such as BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, or GNA11 occur early during progression and additional mutations of TERT, CDKN2A, TP53, and PTEN are seen in late-stage disease. To better evaluate the relationship of these mutations to immunotherapy response, our institution has profiled 95 patients with melanoma with next-generation sequencing (NGS). Of the 95 patients profiled, the most common mutations identified were BRAF (38%), NRAS (21%), TP53 (18%), PTEN (14%), TERT (9%), and CDKN2A (8%). We are presently conducting a retrospective analysis of these selected oncogenes as they relate to clinical responses, and intend to report disease outcomes (duration of response, progression free survival, and overall survival) as they relate to checkpoint inhibition.","title":"Is it what\u0027s on the inside that counts?
