MEN 2A and FMTC are caused by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene.\nWe used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based assay to screen exons 10, 11, 13, and 14 of RET for mutations in 2 families with FMTC. We correlated mutation status with calcitonin and pathologic studies to determine genotype-phenotype correlations.\nWe identified a mutation in codon 804 in exon 14 (GTG--\u003eATG; V804M) in both families. An 86-year-old person who was a gene carrier and other individuals over age 70 who were suspected by pedigree analysis to be gene carriers had no overt clinical evidence of MTC. Four of 21 patients who underwent a thyroidectomy also had papillary thyroid cancer. One individual in each family had metastatic MTC at age 30 and 32 years, and all 26 people having thyroidectomies had either MTC or C-cell hyperplasia, leading us to continue to recommend prophylactic thyroidectomy for all identified patients who were gene carriers.\nBecause of active MTC in younger members of these families, including metastases, we have continued to advocate thyroid surgery in mutation-positive individuals. While DNA diagnosis of gene carriers and subsequent genetic counseling was relatively straightforward, the acceptance of surgical recommendations was more difficult for some individuals. These families demonstrate that the search for RET mutations should include exons 13, 14, 15, and 16 in patients whose studies in exons 10 and 11 are negative.","title":"Variable expressivity of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) due to a RET V804M (GTG--\u003eATG) mutation.","pubmedId":"10876191"}
