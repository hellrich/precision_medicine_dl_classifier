We, therefore, established a new cell line of human MPM, TU-MM-1, to elucidate its biological properties and to develop novel therapeutic strategies. The cells showed polygonal morphology, grew in monolayers without contact inhibition and were arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. The chromosome numbers ranged from 41 to 44. A low rate of proliferation was observed and the doubling time was 67.9 h. Genomic DNA sequencing revealed that TU-MM-1 cells harbored missense mutations in APC, LATS2, BRCA1/2, and TP53, and mutation of a splice donor site in BAP1 and loss of CDKN2A gene. We observed the absence of BAP1 and p16INK4a proteins, underexpression of LATS2 protein, and overexpression of p53 protein in TU-MM-1 cells in western blot analysis. Heterotransplantation to nude mice produced tumors that had the characteristics of the original tumor. This cell line may be useful for studying biological properties and contribute to novel treatment strategies.","title":"Establishment and mutation analysis of a novel malignant peritoneal mesothelioma cell line, TU-MM-1","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-643"}
