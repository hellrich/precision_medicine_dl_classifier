In the present work MMAC/PTEN gene expression in women with endometrial adenocarcinoma (n\u003d70) in RNA samples obtained from cancer tissue were investigated. Control DNA was obtained from 68 normal endometrial tissue. The MMAC/PTEN expression was determined by RT-PCR analysis. The expression of MMAC/PTEN gene in endometrial adenocarcinoma cases was significantly reduced compared to the expression in the normal samples (P \u003c 0.05). Furthermore the significant difference (P \u003c 0.05) was observed between the expression of MMAC/PTEN in stage III versus lower stages of endometrial cancer. The results support the hypothesis that the MMAC/PTEN gene expression may be associated with the incidence of endometrial cancer.","title":"MMAC/PTEN gene expression in endometrial cancer: RT-PCR studies.","pubmedId":"17219740"}
