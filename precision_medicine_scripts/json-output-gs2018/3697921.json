The proband, who had three different primary tumors, died of gastric cancer, as did his father. Four of the proband\u0027s six siblings were affected with melanoma or basal cell cancer, as were two of his three children. Both daughters of one melanoma patient developed basal cell cancers. No spouses were affected, the cases were widely separated in time and place, and no unusual exposures were reported. HLA analysis of affected and unaffected first-degree relatives showed no association with antigens previously described in familial melanoma or segregation with a specific HLA haplotype. Although there was no association with HLA phenotype, these results suggest that melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma can be inherited in an autosomally dominant pattern similar to other familial tumor syndromes.","title":"Familial aggregation of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"3697921"}
