Patients with BRAF V600E metastatic melanoma received vemurafenib orally, in the French temporary authorization for use program from April 2011 to April 2012. We analysed the clinical benefit and safety of vemurafenib. Secondary analyses included the impact of brain metastases on median OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Fifty patients were enrolled, of whom 20% had stage IIIC and 80% stage IV disease. The majority were men (58%), with a median age of 58 years (51-69). Forty-three patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 (86%). Twenty patients had brain metastases (40%). Overall response rate was 53%. Complete response was achieved in five patients (10%), partial response in 21 patients (43%) and stable disease in seven patients (14%). Median OS was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval 5.6-12.7) and PFS was 3.6 months (95% confidence interval 2.9-5.9). Patients with brain metastasis had a response rate of 50% (nine partial response, one complete response), and median OS and PFS were, respectively, 4.3 and 3.1 months. Common adverse events were fatigue, arthralgia and cutaneous side effects. Sixteen per cent developed squamous cell carcinoma. Grade 3/4 was observed in 11 patients (22%). Six per cent required temporary discontinuation and/or dose reduction because of toxic effects. This study confirms the considerable clinical benefit of vemurafenib for patients with brain metastasis, with manageable toxicity.
