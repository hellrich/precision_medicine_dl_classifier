However, few studies have been performed on SLNB in Asia, which is an acral melanoma-prevalent area. This study evaluated the clinicopathologic prognostic factors of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in Taiwanese patients with cutaneous melanoma who received wide excision and SLNB. The prognosis of patients with false-negative (FN) SLNB was also evaluated.\nMalignant melanoma cases were reviewed for 518 patients who were treated between January 2000 and December 2011. Of these patients, 127 patients with node-negative cutaneous melanoma who received successful SLNB were eligible for inclusion in the study.\nThe SLNB-positive rate was 34.6%. The median DFS was 51.5 months, and the median OS was 90.9 months at the median follow-up of 36.6 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients whose melanoma had a Breslow thickness greater than 2 mm had a significantly shorter DFS than patients whose melanoma had a Breslow thickness of 2 mm or less [hazard ratio (HR), 3.421; p \u003d 0.005]. Independent prognostic factors of OS were a Breslow thickness greater than 2 mm (HR, 4.435; p \u003d 0.002); nonacral melanoma (HR, 3.048; p \u003d 0.001); and an age older than 65 years (HR, 2.819; p \u003d 0.036). During the follow-up period, 13 of 83 SLN-negative patients developed a regional nodal recurrence. The SLNB failure rate was 15.7% and the FN rate was 22.8%. Compared to patients with a true-positive SLNB, patients with FN SLNB had a significantly shorter DFS (p \u003d 0.001) but no significant difference in OS (p \u003d 0.262).\nExcept for the pathologic subtypes, prognostic factors in Taiwan are similar to those used in other melanoma-prevalent countries. Identifying and closely monitoring patients at risk of nodal recurrence after a negative SLNB is important.","title":"Prognostic factors for Taiwanese patients with cutaneous melanoma undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy.","pubmedId":"23969039"}
