The main criteria of insertion in Group B were different histology and the same histology with disease-free interval â‰¤ 4 years; we excluded loco-regional recurrence in nodes and/or on bronchial stump.\nGroup A: Twenty patients; Disease free time (DFT) after first operation was 15.2 months (range 2-44). One, two and three years overall survival after second resection was 74%, 29%, 14% respectively. Group B: Thirty-six patients. One, two and three years overall survival was 94%, 81%, and 69% respectively. No statistical differences on outcome were found between the two groups in spite of the apparent worse survival rate for Group A (p\u003d.197).\nA further resection for additional nodules, whether designated as intrapulmonary metastases or second primary NSCLC, can be an appropriate curative strategy in selected patients with unimpaired respiratory function and no evidence of distant metastatic disease. The site, the extent of the second resection, the histology and even the stage are unlikely to be related to survival.","title":"Pulmonary Metastases from NSCLC and MPLC (Multiple Primary Lung Cancers): Management and Outcome in a Single Centre Experience.","pubmedId":"26525847"}
