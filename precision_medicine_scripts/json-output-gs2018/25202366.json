The current study presents one case of PLB treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and a review of the literature to elucidate the optimal treatment of PLB. A 73-year-old female presented with pain in the left hip that had persisted for two months. Plain X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging of the left hip showed lytic areas involving the left innominatum. Technetium-99m radionuclide imaging showed increased tracer uptake in the ilium, acetabulum and ischium. An 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) scan showed high FDG uptake. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the lesion was performed, and histopathological and immunohistochemical examination confirmed a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma. The patient received radiation therapy followed by six cycles of CHOP regimen (1,000 mg cyclophosphamide, 80 mg epirubicine and 2 mg vincristine on day one, and 100 mg prednisone on days one to five, every three weeks) and achieved a complete response, as confirmed by FDG-PET-CT. At present, the patient is in a good condition. This case is noteworthy, as it is a well-documented case in which the patient received successful treatment. This case demonstrates that PLB has an improved prognosis compared with primary lymphoma of other sites; however, combined therapy may further improve the patient outcome.","title":"Primary bone lymphoma: A case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"25202366"}
