Malignant melanoma of the penis is rare and accounts for a small percentage of malignant melanomas and of malignant penile lesions. The diagnosis is often delayed by the patient\u0027s reluctance to consult a physician and by the intrinsic difficulty in clinical diagnosis of such a rare neoplasm. The surgical treatment is not standardized and is shortly discussed. In general, prognosis is poor and most patients die within a few years due to distant metastasis.","title":"Malignant melanoma of the penis.","pubmedId":"9236908"}
