In the process of forming new blood vessels stimulators of angiogenesis participate. There is an increase production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-C and VEGF-D), which expression cause change of endothelial cells, and higher degree of tumor\u0027s aggressiveness. The aim of this research was to determine the level of VEGF expression in skin melanoma in different body regions and in different primary stages of the disease.\nThe research was conducted on bioptic materials of skin in 39 patients. On excision-made materials a routine histological preparation was done and following parameters were determined: histological type, alteration thickness (according to Breslow), Clark level, TNM (Tumor Nodus Metastasis) stage (pT), alteration width, thickness of lymphocytic infiltration in the tumor, mitotic index, phase of the tumor growth, presence of ulcerations, cellular type of the tumor, localization and level of VEGF expression.\nAnalysis confirmed that 61.54% of skin melanoma showed a high VEGF expression. Nodular and acral lentiginous melanomas showed more frequently a high level of VEGF expression, while superficial spreading melanoma showed a lower level of VEGF expression (p \u003d 0.032, p \u003c 0.05). A higher level of expression was present in thicker melanomas (higher in the Breslow stage; p \u003d 0.011, p \u003c 0.05). The width of the lesion did not have an influence on the level of VEGF expression in melanoma (U \u003d142.000, p \u003d 0.273).\nMelanomas show a higher level of VEGF expression. Nodular and acral lentiginous types of melanoma show a high level of VEGF expression, while superficial spreading melanoma shows a lower level of VEGF expression. Melanomas in higher-stage disease (Breslow, Clark, pTNM) show a higher level of VEGF expression.","title":"Significance of vascular endothelial growth factor expression in skin melanoma.","pubmedId":"20949875"}
