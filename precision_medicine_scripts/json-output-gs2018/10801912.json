Following a somatic mutation of the remaining wild-type allele, mice spontaneously develop approximately 40-50 tumors throughout the intestinal tract. This mouse model has been used to study intestinal tumorigenesis because this mutation is analogous to the inherited APC mutation in humans with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). These individuals characteristically develop numerous adenomas throughout their intestinal tracts. Only a few studies have evaluated the effects of dietary fatty acids on tumorigenesis in this animal model with varying results, and none have linked these effects to alterations in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. This study was designed to evaluate the antitumorigenic effect of dietary (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the Apc(Min/+) mouse model and to determine whether these effects are related to inhibition of AA metabolism. Male Apc(Min/+)mice were fed diets supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), AA or a combination of AA + EPA. Mean tumor number in the EPA group was 68% lower (P\u003c0.05) compared with the control group, whereas AA supplementation did not significantly alter tumor load. The reduction in tumor load coincided with significant reductions in intestinal AA content and levels of prostaglandins. However, supplementing AA to the EPA diet (AA + EPA) abolished the antitumorigenic effect of EPA, increased tissue AA content fourfold and prostaglandin production two- to fourfold. These results indicate that AA is involved in tumorigenesis and suggest that EPA\u0027s ability to reduce tumor load in Apc(Min/+) mice is related to reductions in tissue AA content or its metabolism.","title":"Antagonism of arachidonic acid is linked to the antitumorigenic effect of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid in Apc(Min/+) mice.","pubmedId":"10801912"}
