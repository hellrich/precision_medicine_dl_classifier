The current study presents two cases of COP following radiotherapy: A 48-year-old premenopausal female with breast cancer and an 84-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer. In the cases of breast cancer and lung cancer, patients were first diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia and radiation pneumonitis, respectively. In the two cases, computed tomography disclosed the migration of ground glass shadows, which were finally resolved without any fibrotic changes. The two cases were finally diagnosed as COP associated with radiotherapy. When an infiltrating shadow is present outside of the irradiated field, COP must be included in the differential diagnosis.","title":"Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia associated with radiation: A report of two cases.","pubmedId":"24396439"}
