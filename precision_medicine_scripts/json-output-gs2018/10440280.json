We attempted an epidemiologic survey of the cases of plantar melanoma treated in our institute to study the survival rate in the recent period.\nOf the 207 cases of malignant melanoma observed over the past 28 years, 62 patients were diagnosed as having plantar melanoma. The proportion of plantar melanoma to all melanomas, the sex and age of the patients, and the histologic type, stage, and prognosis were evaluated by comparing those registered in the first half (1969-1982) and the second half (1983-1996) of the period.\nThe proportions of plantar melanoma in the first and second half periods were 31% (28 out of 90) and 29% (34 out of 117), respectively. No sex difference in the patients was observed. The mean age of the patients was 67 years. Fifty-one lesions were histologically proven to be acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), two were superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), and nine were nodular melanoma (NM). Of the nine NMs, eight were registered in the second half period. The heel was affected in 33 (53%), the metatarsal regions in nine (14%), the toes in six (10%), and the arch areas in 14 (23%). The proportion of the weight-bearing areas, including the heel, metatarsal areas, and toes, decreased in the second half period. A comparison of the stages of plantar melanoma showed that, in the first half period, there were 18% of patients with stage IV disease in contrast to none in the second half period. Conversely, the proportion of stage I and II disease was 50% in the second half period, whereas it was only 39% in the first half period. The 5-year survival rates in the first and second half periods were 56% and 71%, respectively.\nThe prognosis of plantar melanoma has improved recently at our institute. The possible explanation for a trend to better survival in the second half period may be related to a decrease in stage IV disease as well as to an increase in the frequency of diagnosis of early stage disease.","title":"Epidemiology and prognosis of plantar melanoma in 62 Japanese patients over a 28-year period.","pubmedId":"10440280"}
