In addition, SEGA showed hairlike processes distributed along the squash direction like strap cells. While the gemistocytic astrocytoma had several tumor cells showing a vertically located nucleus, the tumor cells of SEGA showed nuclei oriented mainly in parallel.\nThese squash cytologic features of SEGA can be very helpful in the differential diagnosis by excluding mimics.","title":"Cytologic characteristics of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in squash smears: morphometric comparisons with gemistocytic astrocytoma and giant cell glioblastoma.","pubmedId":"17536538"}
