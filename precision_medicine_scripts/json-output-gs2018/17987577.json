Another section was stained by hematoxylin-eosin and the tumor grade was determined according to the World Health Organization/International Society of Urological Pathologists criteria.\nTumor specimens belonged to 49 men (65.3%) and 26 women (34.7%) with a mean age of 56.3 +/- 9.1 years (range, 39 to 80 years). The tumor grades were 1, 2, and 3 in 14 (18.7%), 35 (46.7%), and 26 (34.7%) specimens, respectively. A total of 28 (37.3%) patients were positive for overexpression of HER-2/neu. There were 1 case of HER-2/neu-positive (7.1%) with a grade 1 tumor, 10 (28.6%) with grade 2, and 17 (65.4%) with grade 3; a significant relationship between HER-2/neu overexpression and grade of the bladder TCC tumors was found (P \u003d .002).\nExpression of HER-2/neu oncogene has a direct relationship with the grade of the bladder TCC. Further studies with longer follow-up period and a larger sample size can determine the probable role of HER-2/neu expression as a prognostic factor in the TCC of bladder.","title":"Overexpression of HER-2/neu oncogene and transitional cell carcinoma of bladder.","pubmedId":"17987577"}
