Needle biopsy of the prostate did not reveal any malignant tissue. Four months later, the patient presented again with hydronephrosis, which was diagnosed using ultrasonography. Furthermore, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left hydronephrosis caused by a soft tissue mass around the left iliac artery compressing the left ureter. Serum IgG4 level was 918 mg/dl. On immunohistochemical reevaluation of the prostate biopsy specimens, the samples were positive for IgG4 immunostaining. The patient was finally diagnosed with IgG4-related prostatitis with retroperitoneal fibrosis. With steroid therapy, the hydronephrosis and urinary symptoms were ameliorated. Our experience with this case suggests that in a male patient with urinary symptoms, biopsy of the prostate may be useful for exact diagnosis when IgG4-related disease is suspected.
