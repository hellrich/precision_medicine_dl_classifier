Arthritis as a presenting sign of lymphoma, however, is extremely rare. Three children with non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma who had joint swelling at the onset of their disease are reported. Two cases showed histological features of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (Ki-1/CD30 positive), and one of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. In all patients the unusual presentation delayed correct diagnosis.","title":"Arthritis as a presenting feature of non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma.","pubmedId":"9623403"}
