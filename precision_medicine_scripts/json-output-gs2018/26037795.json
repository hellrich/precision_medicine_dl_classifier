Here, we investigated whether the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the density of tumor-infiltrating mononuclear cells (TIMC) predict the occurrence of resistance, hence affecting the clinical outcome in BRAFi-treated MMP.\nPD-L1 expression (cutoff 5%) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry with two different antibodies in BRAF(V600)-mutated formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples from 80 consecutive MMP treated with BRAFi at a single institution. TIMC were evaluated by conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining.\nForty-six and 34 patients received vemurafenib and dabrafenib, respectively. Membranous expression of PD-L1 was detected in 28/80 (35%) of patients. At multivariate analysis, absence of tumoral PD-L1 staining [odd ratio (OR) 10.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7-43.3, P \u003c 0.001] and the presence of TIMC (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.7-24.3, P \u003c 0.005) were associated with a better response to treatment. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 10 and 15 months, respectively. By multivariate assessment, PD-L1 expression [hazard ratio (HR) 4.3, 95% CI 2.1-8.7, P \u003c 0.0001] and absence of TIMC (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.7, P \u003c 0.002) correlated with shorter PFS. PD-L1 overexpression (HR 6.2, 95% CI 2.8-14.2, P \u003c 0.0001) and absence of TIMC (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.5, P \u003c 0.002) were independent prognostic factors for melanoma-specific survival.\nOur results provide the first proof-of-principle evidence for the predictive and prognostic relevance of PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression and density of immune cell infiltration in BRAF(V600)-mutated MMP treated with BRAFi.","title":"The status of PD-L1 and tumor-infiltrating immune cells predict resistance and poor prognosis in BRAFi-treated melanoma patients harboring mutant BRAFV600.","pubmedId":"26037795"}
