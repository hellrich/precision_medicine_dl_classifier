A total of 4 types of IDH1 mutations were identified (c.395G→A, p.R132H, n \u003d 4; c.394C→A, p.R132S, n \u003d 1; c.394C→G, p.R132G, n \u003d 1; c.315C→T, n \u003d 1). The IDH1 mutation caused substitutions of residue R132 except for one (c.315C→T). All IDH2 mutations caused changes of R140 (c.419G→A, p.R140Q, n \u003d 18). The incidence of IDH2 mutation was significantly higher than that of IDH1 mutation (11.0% v 4.3%, P \u003d 0.022). Both IDH1 and IDH2 mutation were detected in one patient, while IDH1 was synonymous substitution (c.315C→T). IDH-mutated cases showed a significantly higher frequency of concurrent FLT3-ITD mutation compared with wildtype cases (34.6% vs 11.9%, P \u003d 0.003), so did IDH mutations concurrent NPM1 mutation vs NPM1 wildtype (28.1% vs 12.7%, P \u003d 0.033), of which the frequency of concurrent NPM1 and FLT-ITD mutations cases with the IDH mutation was significantly higher than that of NPM1 and FLT-ITD negative (45.5% vs 11.7%, P \u003d 0.002). IDH mutation incidence was significantly higher in normal karyotype cases than in abnormal ones (20.5% vs 5.8%, P \u003d 0.020). Patients with IDH mutations were significantly older than wildtype patients(P \u003c 0.001), whereas, there were no statistically significant differences in gender, peripheral blood (PB) count at diagnosis between two groups.\nThe incidence of IDH mutation is higher in patients with de novo AMLs, of which IDH2 mutation more frequently, and the patients associated with older age, normal karyotype at diagnosis. IDH mutation has a strong association with NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations, suggesting that IDH mutation has synergistic effect with the latter gene on leukemogenesis.","title":"[Analysis of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia].","pubmedId":"22781800"}
