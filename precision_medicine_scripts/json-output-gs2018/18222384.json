The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinicopathologic findings of gastric cardia and more distal stomach adenocarcinoma.\nPatients included in our study were those who underwent operations for gastric adenocarcinoma in our institute from 1981 to 2006, and who had undergone complete medical history, including history of daily alcohol consumption; smoking; body mass index; and pathologic examinations. A total of 843 patients were included in our study, and were divided into cardia and noncardia cancer groups.\nAmong the 843 patients, 23 (2.8%) had gastric cardia cancer. There were no substantial differences in age, gender, body mass index, smoking, or alcohol consumption between the two groups. Mean size of cardia tumors was larger than noncardia tumors. Although noncardia cancer was often detected at an early stage, gastric cardia cancer was most often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Pathologically, cardia cancer was more invasive and had more lymphatic permeation and lymph node metastasis than noncardia cancer.\nGastric cardia cancer occurs at a low incidence of only 2.8% of resected gastric cancers. Unlike cases of gastric cardia cancer in Western populations, body mass index is not associated with occurrence of gastric cardia cancer in our study. Because gastric cardia cancer appears more aggressive than noncardia gastric cancer, early diagnosis and intervention are important.","title":"Clinicopathologic features of adenocarcinoma at the gastric cardia: is it different from distal cancer of the stomach?","pubmedId":"18222384"}
