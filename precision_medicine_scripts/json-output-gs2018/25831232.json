However, in 10-15% of all GIST, no such activating mutations can be found and these tumors are classified as \u0027wild-type GIST\u0027 (KIT/PDGFRA wt-GIST). Subgroups of KIT/PDGFRA wt-GIST are driven by other sporadic mutations involving the RAS/RAF/MAP-kinase pathway, such as BRAF or KRAS mutations. Furthermore, KIT/PDGFRA wt-GIST are observed in the context of hereditary syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis Type 1, in which the lack of neurofibromin 1 also leads to the activation of the RAS/RAF/MAP-kinase pathway. Finally, the deficiency succinate dehydrogenase seems to play a major role in KIT/PDGFRA wt-GIST. In conclusion, KIT/PDGFRA wt-GIST belong to different subgroups defined by diverse underlying genetic alterations leading to different biological phenotypes. The vast majority of KIT/PDGFRA wt-GIST will not respond to imatinib. Further research to unravel the pathogenesis of KIT/PDGFRA wt-GIST is prerequisite to the development of effective treatment strategies.
