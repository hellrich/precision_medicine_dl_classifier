In multivariate analysis, high MLL5 expression was a favorable prognostic marker for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.89; P \u003d .007) and relapse-free survival (RFS; HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.01; P \u003d .057). Patient characteristics, cytogenetic aberrations, and gene mutations were similarly distributed between patients with high and low MLL5 expression except for a higher platelet count in those with high MLL5 expression. MLL5 expression independently predicted prognosis in cytogenetically normal AML patients (n \u003d 268; OS: HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33 to 086; P \u003d .011; RFS: HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99; P \u003d .05) and in patients with core-binding factor leukemias (n \u003d 81; OS: HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.91; P \u003d .04; RFS: HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.77; P \u003d .02). The prognostic importance of high MLL5 expression was independently validated in 167 patients treated in the AMLSG 07/04 trial (OS: HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.92; P \u003d .023; RFS: HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.96; P \u003d .033).\nHigh MLL5 expression levels are associated with a favorable outcome and may improve risk and treatment stratification in AML.","title":"Prognostic importance of histone methyltransferase MLL5 expression in acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"21205756"}
