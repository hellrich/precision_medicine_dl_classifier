The Pro allele frequency was significantly higher among esophageal cancer and lung cancer patients than among healthy controls (P value was 0.024 and 0.027 respectively). There were no significant differences in Pro/Arg and Arg/Arg genotype frequency among cancer patients and healthy controls (P \u003e 0.05). However, the Pro/Pro genotype frequency was significantly higher among esophageal cancer and lung cancer patients than among healthy controls (P value was 0.041 and 0.026 respectively). The risk of Pro homozygotes for both esophageal cancer and lung cancer was about 2 times against Arg homozygotes with adjusted odds ratio of 2.12 (95% CI \u003d 1.13 - 4.01) and 2.30 (95% CI \u003d 1.13 - 4.93), respectively. There was no interaction between p53 Pro/Pro genotype and smoking status to the risk for esophageal cancer and lung cancer.\nIn the northern Chinese population, p53 Pro/Pro genotype is an independent risk factor for both esophageal cancer and lung cancer. The possible common genetic basis of the development of these two cancers is suggested by this study.","title":"[p53 gene polymorphism with susceptibility to esophageal cancer and lung cancer in Chinese population].","pubmedId":"12921568"}
