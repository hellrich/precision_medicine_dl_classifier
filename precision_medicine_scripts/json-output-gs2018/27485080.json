For PD-L1 \u003e1% patients versus PD-L1 \u003c1% patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 targeted agents, the OR of ORR was 2.81 (95% CI: 1.64-4.82; p \u003d 0.0002); while for PD-L1 \u003e5% patients versus PD-L1 \u003c5% patients, it was 2.22 (95% CI: 1.71-2.87; p \u003c 0.00001).\nThe current analysis indicates the value of PD-L1 positivity in predicting higher response from PD-1/PD-L1 agents. This molecular predictor - together with other predictors - may help further individualize treatment options for metastatic melanoma patients.","title":"PD-L1 expression and outcome of advanced melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"27485080"}
