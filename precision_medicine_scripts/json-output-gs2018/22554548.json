From more than 100 articles available on the topic, we selected 14 focusing on patients\u0027 outcome. We review and briefly discuss salient findings, and list ten reasons why melanoma molecular classes are not yet used in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. The available evidence suggests that we are on the verge of creating a framework for the use of melanoma molecular classes in prognosis, but so far there is little consensus to put together informative diagnostic and prognostic gene sets.","title":"Melanoma molecular classes and prognosis in the postgenomic era.","pubmedId":"22554548"}
