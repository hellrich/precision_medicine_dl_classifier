However, the role of miR-206 on lung cancer is still ambiguous. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-206 on the development of lung cancer. The results indicated that miR-206 expression was suppressed in lung cancer tissues and very low levels were found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLS) cell lines. Transient transfection of miR-206 into cultured A549 and SK-MES-1 cells led to significant decrease in cell growth, migration, invasion and colony formation, and promoted cell apoptosis. Using bioinformatics, we identified putative miR-206 binding sites within the 3\u0027-untranslated region (3\u0027-UTR) of the human c-Met and Bcl2 mRNA. The expression of c-Met and Bcl2 proteins were shown to be down-regulated after treated with miR-206 by subsequent Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis. Conversely, up-regulation of c-Met and Bcl2 were confirmed in tissue samples of human lung cancer, with its level inversely correlated with miR-206 expression. In addition, miR-206 also decreased the gene expression of MMP-9, CCND1 and CCND2 while increased the gene expression of p57 (Kip2) in A549 and SK-MES-1 cells. Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-206 suppressed c-Met and Bcl2 expression in NSCLS and could function as a potent tumor suppressor in c-Met/Bcl2-over expressing tumors. Inhibition of miR-206 function could contribute to aberrant cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis, leading to NSCLS development.","title":"Down-regulation of c-Met and Bcl2 by microRNA-206, activates apoptosis, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration and colony formation.","pubmedId":"26325180"}
