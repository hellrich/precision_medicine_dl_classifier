The resulting oncogenic fusion genes define molecular sub-types of NSCLC with distinct sensitivities to treatment with various kinase inhibitors. We developed real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays to detect rearrangements of ALK, RET, and ROS1 in FFPE lung cancer tissue.   Methods:  mRNA from NSCLC FFPE tissue samples was reverse transcribed to cDNA. Multiplex quantitative PCR was performed to detect 9 variants of EML4-ALK fusions, 9 variants of RET fusions and 14 variants of ROS1 fusions. A total of 409 samples were analyzed: 267 were classified as adenocarcinoma, 104 as squamous cell carcinoma and 38 had undetermined histology. EGFR and KRAS mutation status is unknown. The junctions of fusion-positive samples were sequenced by Sanger sequencing.  Results:  Among the 409 NSCLC specimens tested the frequency was 5.4% (22/409) for EML4-ALK fusions, 1.5% (6/409) for RET fusions, and 2.2% (9/409) for ROS1 fusions. EML4-ALK fusions were more prevalent in patients that were less than 60 years old (9.1% versus 2.0%, p\u003d 0.004). The TNM stage was not correlated with the presence of any of the fusions. The table below lists the frequencies for specific rearrangements as determined by sequencing the real-time PCR products. Conclusions:  Real-time PCR assays based on cDNA from FFPE tissue can identify patients with ALK, RET and ROS1 fusion genes. The ALK, RET and ROS1 assays will allow selection of patients most likely to respond to therapies that specifically target these cancer drivers. Further clinical testing of NSCLC patients in the Chinese population will be performed to support SFDA registration of these assays in China.GenesPositivesFusion variants: Gene and exon numberVariants %EML4-ALK22/409 (5.4%)EML4 E13; ALK E2014 (3.42%)EML4E6; ALK E203 (0.73%)EML4 E20; ALK E203 (0.73%)EML4 E18; ALK E201 (0.24%)EML4 E2; ALK E201 (0.24%)RET6/409 (1.5%)KIF5B E15; RET E125 (1.22%)KIF5B E22; RET E121 (0.24%)ROS19/409 (2.2%)SLC34A2 E4; ROS1 E323 (0.73%)SLC34A2 E14; ROS1E32 and SLC34A2 E14; ROS1 E342 (0.49%)CD74 E6; ROS1 E321 (0.24%)SDC E2; ROS1 321 (0.24%)CD74 E6; ROS1 E342 (0.49%)","title":"Screening of NSCLC samples from Chinese lung cancer patients for activating rearrangements of the ALK, RET, and ROS1 genes.","pubmedId":"ASCO_114393-132"}
