A statistically significant difference was found for mean estrogen receptor (ER) concentrations in melanomas of male versus female origin: female origin 37.6 (0-107) fmol/mg protein, male origin 3.9 (0-8.3) fmol/mg protein. No significant difference between sexes was found for gestragen receptors: 41.5 (0-194) fmol/mg protein for melanomas of female origin versus 99 (0-362) fmol/mg protein for male. Sucrose density gradient analyses revealed specific binding for both receptor types in the 4-5 S region as well as in the 8 S region. The binding affinities were in the same order of magnitude as reported for receptors found in typical steroid target organs. No significant difference in receptor values depending on sex was found for the glucocorticoid receptor: 19.2 (0-43) fmol/mg protein.","title":"Steroid hormone receptors in human melanoma.","pubmedId":"7165327"}
