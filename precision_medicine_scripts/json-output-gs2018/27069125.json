Our aim was to investigate the role of oxidative stress markers in melanoma.\nWe characterized the immunohistochemical expression of Nrf2, kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), BRAF(V600E), 8-hydroxy-2\u0027-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and nitrotyrosine in 36 nevi, 14 lentigo maligna and 71 malignant melanomas. We measured Nrf2 expression in melanoma cell lines and conducted cytotoxicity assays combining BRAF/NRAS ablation and H2O2treatment.\nNuclear Nrf2 expression in melanoma correlated with deeper Breslow (p\u003c0.0005), invasive phenotype (Clark III-V) (p\u003d0.011), nodular growth (p\u003d0.001) and worse melanoma-specific survival (p\u003d0.008). Absence of 8-OHdG in the endothelium was a greater significant predictor of poor prognosis (p\u003d0.024) than ulceration (p\u003d0.17) and had a similar impact on prognosis as Breslow (p\u003d0.024). A decrease of Nrf2 followed the BRAF/NRAS inhibition, but combination of inhibitor with H2O2did not increase cytotoxicity.\nNrf2 and 8-OHdG influence prognosis in melanoma.","title":"Nrf2/Keap1 Pathway and Expression of Oxidative Stress Lesions 8-hydroxy-2\u0027-deoxyguanosine and Nitrotyrosine in Melanoma.","pubmedId":"27069125"}
