Ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy used in advanced melanoma, is an effective immunotherapy alone or combined with other agents but with few predictive biomarkers of response. Here, we sought to analyze the potential of S100B, MIA, soluble MICA, anti-MICA antibodies and LDH as serum biomarkers of response and survival in a cohort of 77 advanced melanoma patients subjected to ipilimumab. Lower levels of S100B, and LDH at baseline and at weeks 3 and 6 correlated to a better response and survival. After multivariate analysis LDH maintained its independence at baseline and week 6, whereas S100B might be a useful tool for anti-CTLA-4 treatment monitoring after the first two doses of ipilimumab (W6). In addition, higher sMICA serum levels at baseline were associated with less frequency of irAEs.","title":"Relevance of serum biomarkers associated with melanoma during follow-up of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"27728898"}
