The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between altered expression of MET and phospho-BAD in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and their association with clinicopathologic parameters and overall survival.\nMET and phospho-BAD(Ser-136) proteins were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis in 183 paraffin-embedded specimens and were also assessed by Western blotting analysis in 12 frozen tumor tissue samples, which were representative examples of immunohistochemical staining.\nPositive expression of MET and phospho-BAD(Ser-136) occurred in 67.2% and 49.2% of the 183 cases of NSCLC, respectively. However, neither MET expression nor phospho-BAD(Ser-136) expression was associated with any clinicopathologic parameter. A significant correlation was found between MET and phospho-BAD(Ser-136) expression levels evaluated by immunohistochemistry (r \u003d 0.268, P \u003c 0.001). Overexpression of MET was significantly associated with shortened overall survival in univariate analysis (P \u003c 0.001). Moreover, patients with a MET+/phospho-BAD(Ser-136)+ phenotype had a poorer prognosis than others (P \u003c 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis confirmed that MET expression is a prognostic factor for NSCLC.\nMET expression might be correlated with phospho-BAD(Ser-136) expression, and may be an adverse predictor for NSCLC. Activation of the MET/phospho-BAD(Ser-136) signaling pathway might play a role in the development and progression of NSCLC.","title":"Expression and prognostic relevance of MET and phospho-BAD in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24092988"}
