A significant fraction of melanomas are thought to result from UV-induced DNA damage that escapes repair; however, little evidence is available about the functional capacity of normal human melanocytes, malignant melanoma cells, and metastatic melanoma cells to repair UV-induced photoproducts in DNA. In this study, we measured nucleotide excision repair in both normal melanocytes and a panel of melanoma cell lines. Our results show that in 11 of 12 melanoma cell lines tested, UV photoproduct repair occurred as efficiently as in primary melanocytes. Importantly, repair capacity was not affected by mutation in the N-RAS or B-RAF oncogenes, nor was a difference observed between a highly metastatic melanoma cell line (A375SM) or its parental line (A375P). Lastly, we found that although p53 status contributed to photoproduct removal efficiency, its role did not seem to be mediated by enhanced expression or activity of DNA binding protein DDB2. We concluded that melanoma cells retain capacity for nucleotide excision repair, the loss of which probably does not commonly contribute to melanoma progression.","title":"Similar nucleotide excision repair capacity in melanocytes and melanoma cells.","pubmedId":"20501836"}
