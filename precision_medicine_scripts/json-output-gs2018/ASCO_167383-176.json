Sensitivity to these checkpoint inhibitors is known to correlate with high TMB. Numerous somatic and germline defects can lead to high TMB, including alterations affecting the mismatch repair pathway, DNA polymerases, and cell cycle regulators. We present novel mutations in the promoter of PMS2 that are significantly associated with high TMB. Methods: Hybridization capture of 236 or 315 cancer-related genes and select introns from 19 or 28 genes commonly rearranged in cancer was performed on DNA extracted from \u003e 51,000 clinical FFPE cancer specimens and sequenced to high, uniform coverage ( \u003e 500x). TMB was assessed as the number of somatic coding point mutations per megabase of targeted territory. Results: TMB assessed via targeted sequencing of ~1.25Mb broadly recapitulates previous results of whole exome TMB analysis. Analysis of recurrent somatic mutations identified common mutations in the promoter of PMS2, a dimerization partner of MLH1 and integral to the DNA mismatch repair complex. Promoter mutations were found in 7.5% of melanoma specimens (n \u003d 101/1,348) and 17% of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC) (n \u003d 30/175). In both tumor types, PMS2 promoter mutations are the most significant (p \u003c 1e-5, MannWhitney U test) genomic correlate of TMB. Within the melanoma population, median TMB of PMS2 promoter mutant tumors increased \u003e 5-fold (9.5 to 53.3 mutations per Mb). PMS2 promoter mutant cSCC showed a 2-fold increase in TMB over wild type tumors (35.9 to 72.7 mutations per Mb). Conclusions:PMS2 promoter mutations extend the small set of known non-coding mutations thought to affect tumor development and highlight the power of large-scale genomic analysis to uncover novel disease mechanisms. Given recent evidence that TMB may be the most sensitive and specific predictor of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy in a variety of tumor types, further study of PMS2 promoter mutation as a biomarker for immunotherapy selection appears warranted.","title":"Analysis of tumor mutation burden (TMB) in \u003e51,000 clinical cancer patients to identify novel non-coding PMS2 promoter mutations associated with increased TMB.","pubmedId":"ASCO_167383-176"}
