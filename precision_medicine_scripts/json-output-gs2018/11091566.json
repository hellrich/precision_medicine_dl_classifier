In our department we treated 38 cases with conservation surgery for early stage breast cancers between February 1988 and October 1994, and local recurrence occurred in 2. PATIENT 1. A 56-year-old-woman had a 1 x 0.8 cm tumor in the C region of the left breast. A quadrantectomy with axillary dissection (level 2) was performed as the margin of the nipple side was negative, followed by entire breast irradiation (50 Gy). Approximately four years after the first operation she developed a local recurrence in the CD region of the breast. A salvage mastectomy with subclavicular lymph node dissection was performed. After the second operation she appears to be healthy. PATINENT 2. A 54-year-old-woman noticed a 1 cm tumor located in the EAC region of the left breast. Excisional biopsy showed solid-tubular carcinoma. The distance between the nipple and the tumor was only 0.7 cm. A wide excision with axillary dissection (level 2) was performed as the margin of the nipple side was negative on the frozen section. Neither irradiation of the entire breast nor the adjuvant chemotherapy could be performed. After a three and a half year follow up local recurrence beneath the operative scar was recognized, and an additional wide excision was performed. A half year has passed since the second operation, there have been no signs of recurrence and she appears to be healthy. In conclusion, we experienced two local recurrences in 38 cases of breast conservation surgery for early breast cancers. One patient had multicentric cancers with histologically different types: mucinous and noninvasive ductal carcinoma, and another had a very short distance between the nipple and the tumor and did not undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","title":"Local Recurrence after Conservative Surgery for Breast Cancer.","pubmedId":"11091566"}
