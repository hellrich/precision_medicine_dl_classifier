Chemoprevention of GI luminal cancers is important to reduce this cancer burden. Screening for and eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in areas with high gastric cancer incidence is a safe and effective strategy to decrease the incidence of gastric cancer. Eradication of H. pylori also seems to be effective in preventing metachronous cancer development after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer. For the average risk individual, COX inhibitors may have a role in reducing the incidence of adenoma formation as well as colorectal cancer, bearing in mind its inherent risks. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend a chemoprevention agent against esophageal and small intestine cancer.
