DNA sequencing of the insert from this clone revealed that it contained the highly conserved domains IV and V of the p53 polypeptide. To map the Xiphophorus p53 gene, joint segregation analysis of the inheritance of a PstI-generated DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and the inheritance of 36 polymorphic protein and DNA markers was performed in backcross hybrids of X. clemenciae x (X. clemenciae x X. milleri) and X. helleri x X. (helleri x X. maculatus Jp 163 B) using Oncorhynchus cDNA and Xiphophorus genomic p53 probes, respectively. The p53-hybridizing sequence (TP53) was linked to the ACO1 (cytosolic aconitase) locus in both crosses, and defines a new Xiphophorus linkage group, designated LG XIV. This is the first mapping assignment of a known human tumor suppressor gene in fish. Since ACO1 is not linked with melanoma severity in X. helleri x X. maculatus Jp 163 A backcross hybrids, these data indicate that homozygosity for the X. helleri TP53 genotype in backcross hybrids of the cross type is not associated with genetically regulated malignant melanoma formation in the Gordon-Kosswig hybrid melanoma model.","title":"Assignment of the TP53 orthologue to a new linkage group (LG XIV) in fish of the genus Xiphophorus (Teleostei: Poeciliidae).","pubmedId":"8640724"}
