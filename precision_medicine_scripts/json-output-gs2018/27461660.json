It accounts for most cases of minor salivary gland malignancies and a substantial proportion of parotid and submandibular gland malignancies. ACC is associated with a high mortality rate, and it often recurs after prolonged periods of time, and this occurs even when radical excision has been performed.\nThe present study was aimed to determine the localization of dual cell population and to analyze the potency of using a system of dual markers (c-kit and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]) in enhancing the characterization of ACC.\nThree micrometer thin sections of adenoid cystic carcinoma were obtained. One set of slides was stained by hematoxylin and eosin for reconfirmation of histological diagnosis while the other two sets were stained for c-kit and EGFR using immunohistochemical method. Statistical Analysis Used and Results: Show c-kit expression to be limited to the inner ductal epithelial cells and the EGFR expression mainly to the outer myoepithelial cells in the majority of tubular and cribriform patterns. In solid ACC, c-kit was uniformly positive while EGFR was consistently negative.\nC-kit and EGFR biomarkers can be used to enhance the characterization of ACC and to determine the localization of dual cell population which could suggest the dual origin of ACC and provides evidence for the new therapeutic strategy in ACC.","title":"Characterization and localization of c-kit and epidermal growth factor receptor in different patterns of adenoid cystic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"27461660"}
