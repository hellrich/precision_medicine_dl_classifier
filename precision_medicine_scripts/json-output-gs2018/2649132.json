The mean follow-up time was 5.5 years, ranging from 8 months to 17 years. Eight patients developed metastases and seven have died. The mean time from diagnosis to death due to metastasis was 3.8 years (range 1-6 years). The site of the primary tumour seemed to be most closely correlated to high metastatic risk. Only two of the sixteen limbal melanomas metastasised, whereas two of the four bulbar, all three tarsal and the only diffuse primary tumour caused metastatic disease. Two of the metastasising primary tumours were less than 1.5 mm thick, but all exceeded 0.8 mm in thickness. The mitotic rate, the amount of inflammatory infiltrate, the cell type or the presence of adjacent intraepithelial involvement did not obviously correlate to treatment outcome. Furthermore, the expression of S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), both suggested to be prognostic indicators in cutaneous melanoma, did not correlate to the tendency of the conjunctival melanomas to recur or metastasise.","title":"Prognosis of conjunctival melanomas in relation to histopathological features.","pubmedId":"2649132"}
