A total of 59 cases of melanoma, including 23 melanoma in situ and 36 thin invasive melanomas (Breslow thickness \u003c or \u003d0.75 mm), and 188 clinically equivocal, histopathologically diagnosed Clark naevi were used in our study. After calculating 62 mathematical variables related to the colour, texture, asymmetry and circularity based on the dermoscopic findings of the pigmented skin lesions, we performed multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis using these variables to differentiate melanomas from naevi. The sensitivities and specificities of our model were 94.4 and 98.4%, respectively, for discriminating between melanomas (Breslow thickness \u003c or \u003d0.75 mm) and Clark naevi, and 73.9 and 85.6%, respectively, for discriminating between melanoma in situ and Clark naevi. Our algorithm accurately discriminated invasive melanomas from Clark naevi, but not melanomas in situ from Clark naevi.","title":"Linear discriminant analysis of dermoscopic parameters for the differentiation of early melanomas from Clark naevi.","pubmedId":"15057043"}
