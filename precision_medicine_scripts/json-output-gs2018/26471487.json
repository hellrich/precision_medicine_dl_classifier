This study aimed to describe the mutation frequency of 12 genes in different CRC phenotypes.\nPatients who underwent surgery at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital during 2000-2010 for CRC (n \u003d 1249) were enrolled. The endpoint was overall survival. The prognostic value was determined with the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis.\nWe found 1836 mutations of 12 genes in 997 (79.8%) tumors. Mutations were most frequently in KRAS (485, 38.8%), TP53 (373, 29.9%), APC (363, 29.0%), and PIK3CA (179, 14.3%); 137 (11.0%) cancers had high microsatellite instability (MSI). Women had significantly higher high MSI (14.3%) and BRAF mutation (6.3%) frequencies. The abnormal MSI (21.7%) and KRAS (44.6%), BRAF (8.6%), PIK3CA (19.4%), AKT1 (2.2%), and TGF - βR (9.6%) mutation frequencies were significantly higher in proximal colon cancer. The high MSI (35.6%) and BRAF (20.3%), TGF - βR (18.6%), PTEN (5.1%), and AKT1 (3.4%) mutation frequencies were significantly higher in 59 (4.7%) poorly differentiated tumors. The high MSI (21.3%) and KRAS (51.9%), BRAF (8.3%), PIK3CA (25.0%), AKT1 (4.6%), and SMAD4 (8.3%) mutation frequencies were significantly higher in 108 mucinous tumors. TNM stage, lymphovascular invasion, and mucinous histology were significantly associated with patient outcomes in univariate and multivariate analyses. Only NRAS mutation (hazard ratio 1.59, 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.38) affected patient survival.\nMutational spectra differ significantly between CRC subtypes, implying diverse carcinogenetic pathways. The NRAS mutation is important, despite its low frequency.","title":"Mutation Spectra of Common Cancer-Associated Genes in Different Phenotypes of Colorectal Carcinoma Without Distant Metastasis.","pubmedId":"26471487"}
