In contrast, chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) can be evaluated by routine light microscopy. In endometrial carcinoma there are few data concerning HER-2/neu status and prognosis. Therefore, we determined HER-2/neu gene status by CISH using a digoxigenin-labelled probe on 60 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded endometrial carcinomas. The data were compared with the immunohistochemistry of HER-2/neu (A0485, TAB250), p53, Ki-67, clinicopathological factors, and survival. By conventional light microscopy, HER-2/neu amplification (\u003e/\u003d6 copies \u003e50% cancer cells) was detected in 14% (8/59) tumours, HER-2/neu overexpression (\u003e10% cells moderate/strong complete membrane staining) in 22% (13/60) for A0485, and 18% (11/60) for TAB250, p53 (\u003e10% +cells) in 61% (36/59), and Ki-67 (\u003e50% +cells) in 50% (30/60). Discordant cases for CISH and immunohistochemistry, as well as all (2+) were further analysed by FISH (Vysis). Among 10 cases (2+) and not amplified by CISH, two showed low-level amplification by FISH. Significant correlation was found between amplification and protein overexpression (P\u003c/\u003d0.001), and a trend with nonendometrioid type, higher grade, and older age. A better outcome (Kaplan-Meier) was observed for patients with nonamplified (1-5 copies per nucleus) or low-level (6-10 copies) amplification tumours, low Ki-67 expression, age \u003c50 years, endometrioid type, low FIGO (International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology) grade and stage, superficial myometrial infiltration, and no lymph-vascular invasion (P\u003c/\u003d0.036), but only as a trend for HER-2/neu protein negative (P\u003d0.13). Cox analysis revealed age, FIGO grade and stage, myometrial infiltration, and lymph-vascular invasion to be independent prognostic factors (P\u003c/\u003d0.05), and a trend for HER-2/neu gene copy number (0.18). In endometrial carcinoma, HER-2/neu gene status can be readily assessed by CISH in routine clinical practice, and it gives more prognostic information than HER-2/neu by immunohistochemistry. FISH analysis in (2+) cases but negative by CISH may detect additional tumours with low-level amplification.","title":"Analysis of HER-2/neu amplification in endometrial carcinoma by chromogenic in situ hybridization.
