Further assessments of pathological tumor burden (estimated tumor volume, percent of cancer involvement, and estimated tumor volume/PSA ratios) were performed across Gleason score categories.\nOf 4157 patients in the analysis, 604 (14.5%) were AA. Overall, AA patients were younger, had higher Gleason scores, PSA levels and incidence of palpable disease (all P \u003c 0.001). Despite comparable prostate weights (39.4 vs. 39.6 g), AA men had higher percent cancer involvement and estimated tumor volume (all P \u003c 0.001) but similar estimated tumor volume/PSA ratios ( P\u003e 0.05). When stratified by Gleason scores, prostate weights were comparable; however, estimated tumor volume, percent cancer involvement and estimated tumor volume/PSA ratios were higher in AA men with low grade (≤ 6) prostate cancer (PCa), similar in intermediate grade (7-8) and lower in high grade (9-10) PCa compared to nAA men.\nIn this large series, AA patients had higher disease burden (estimated tumor volume, percent cancer involvement, estimated tumor volume/PSA ratios) compared to nAA but this association was especially pronounced in low grade (Gleason ≤ 6) cancers. These data depict a complex picture of relations between race and tumor burden across the spectrum of PCa aggressiveness. Further investigation is warranted to understand the mechanisms of racial disparities in PCa.","title":"African-American men with low-grade prostate cancer have higher tumor burdens: results from the Duke Prostate Center.","pubmedId":"23032361"}
