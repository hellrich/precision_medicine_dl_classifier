Tegafur-uracil showed an excellent anticancer effect against colorectal metastatic liver cancers without loss of QOL because a single-low dose of intraarterial anticancer injection was followed by continuous oral administration of tegafur-uracil, and the chemotherapy could be managed to obtain complete remission of the hepatic lesion.","title":"[Complete remission of liver metastasis from rectal cancer following continuous oral administration of tegafur-uracil after intrahepatic arterial single injection of CDDP and 5-FU].","pubmedId":"9757204"}
