We identified the T-box member TBX2 as a potent immortalizing gene that acts by downregulating Cdkn2a (p19(ARF)). TBX2 represses the Cdkn2a (p19(ARF)) promoter and attenuates E2F1, Myc or HRAS-mediated induction of Cdkn2a (p19(ARF)). We found TBX2 to be amplified in a subset of primary human breast cancers, indicating that it might contribute to breast cancer development.","title":"Senescence bypass screen identifies TBX2, which represses Cdkn2a (p19(ARF)) and is amplified in a subset of human breast cancers.","pubmedId":"11062467"}
