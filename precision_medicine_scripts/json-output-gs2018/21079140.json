A 3:1 comparison cohort case-matched by age, sex, race, and education was created from the 2005 NHIS. Contingency tables and multivariate models were used to compare cohorts and determine predictors of preventive care and cancer surveillance.\nA total of 708 patients in protocol LTS-01 (681 patients with colon cancer, 27 patients with rectal cancer) completed the interview: 57.1% male, mean age 66.2 years (standard deviation\u003d10.6), median survival 8 years. Patients in the LTS-01 protocol were more likely to have a usual source of health care (97.7% v 93.8%, P\u003c.0001), have received a flu shot in the past 12 months (67.5% v 44.3%, P\u003c.0001), and have undergone cancer screening by Pap smear (67.3% v 54.8%, P\u003c.0001), mammogram (80.4% v 70.7%, P\u003c.0001), and prostate-specific antigen test (84.5% v 74.5%, P\u003c.0001) than patients in the NHIS cohort. For CRC surveillance, 96.5% of patients in protocol LTS-01 had a colonoscopy, 88.2% had a carcinoembryonic antigen test, and 66.4% had a computed tomography scan in the previous 5 years. Health insurance was the best predictor of cancer screening for all three methods (odds ratio\u003d2.6 to 4.5). No factor was uniformly associated with CRC surveillance.\nThis select population of long-term CRC survivors who participated in clinical trials achieved better routine preventive care and cancer screening than the general population and high rates of cancer surveillance.","title":"Routine preventive care and cancer surveillance in long-term survivors of colorectal cancer: results from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol LTS-01.","pubmedId":"21079140"}
