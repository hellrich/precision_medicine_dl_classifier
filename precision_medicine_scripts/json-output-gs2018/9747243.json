We report a case of long standing ulceration of the sole which was found to be an epithelioid sarcoma.\nA 78-year-old woman had an indolent ulceration of the left sole for several months. Physical examination disclosed a well demarcated 3-cm ulcerated lesion with a red center and flat edges. Skin sections confirmed the diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma. Cells stained positively for anti-vimentin, anti-cytokeratin and anti-epithelial membrane antigen, but not for anti-S100 protein and anti-actin antibodies. Wide local excision was performed.\nEpithelioid sarcoma is an uncommon malignant tumor which apparently differentiates from mesenchymatous cells. It is usually observed in the distal extremities in young males, predominantly the hands and forearms. The tumor presents a firm, flesh-colored indolent nodule. Ulceration usually develops and involves the subcutis and deeper soft tissue, particularly fascial planes, aponeuroses and tendon sheaths. Treatment is wide surgical excision with or without radiotherapy. The case reported here on the sole of the foot in a 78-year-old women is unusual. Clinicians should be aware that the initial biopsy may not be contributive and that repeated biopsies may be necessary for positive diagnosis.","title":"[Epithelioid sarcoma manifesting as chronic plantar arch ulceration].","pubmedId":"9747243"}
