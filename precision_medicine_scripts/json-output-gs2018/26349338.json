He had a past history of a left thyroidectomy with neck dissection 7 years previously. A RET gene analysis revealed a point mutation (codon 618), and we diagnosed him as having hereditary medullary thyroid cancer. We resected the recurrent tumor in the right thyroid lobe together with performing a right lateral and central neck dissection. A RET gene analysis should be performed for patients with medullary thyroid cancer. When a RET gene mutation is present, a total thyroidectomy must be performed for the medullary thyroid cancer.","title":"[A Case of Hereditary Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MEN2A/FMTC) Diagnosed at the Time of Recurrence].","pubmedId":"26349338"}
