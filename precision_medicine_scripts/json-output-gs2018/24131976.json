We focus on differences between the ethical issues related to male and female BC patients. A systematic literature search by using PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), was carried out to provide a synopsis of the current research in the field of MBC genetics, epigenetics and ethics. Original articles and reviews published up to September 2012 were selected by using the following search key words to query the PubMed website: \u0027male breast cancer\u0027, \u0027male breast cancer and genetic susceptibility\u0027, \u0027male breast cancer and epigenetics\u0027, \u0027male breast cancer and methylation\u0027, \u0027male breast cancer and miRNA\u0027, \u0027male breast cancer and ethics\u0027.\nAs in women, three classes of breast cancer genetic susceptibility (high, moderate, and low penetrance) are recognized in men. However, genes involved and their impact do not exactly overlap in female and male BC. Epigenetic alterations are currently scarcely investigated in MBC, however, the different methylation and miRNA expression profiles identified to date in female and male BCs suggest a potential role for epigenetic alterations as diagnostic biomarkers. Overall, much still needs to be learned about MBC and, because of its rarity, the main effort is to develop large consortia for moving forward in understanding MBC and improving the management of MBC patients on a perspective of gender medicine.","title":"Male breast cancer: genetics, epigenetics, and ethical aspects.","pubmedId":"24131976"}
