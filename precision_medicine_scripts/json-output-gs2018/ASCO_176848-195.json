Drugs directed against HER2 have shown mixed success in the treatment of advanced GC. While trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody addressing HER2 has been approved for 1st-line treatment of stage IV HER2+ GC, trastuzumab-emtansine failed to improve outcomes in 2nd-line and lapatinib, a small molecular RTK inhibitor of HER2 and EGFR was not effective in 1st- and 2nd-line. Until now, primary and secondary resistance against HER2-directed treatment of GC is not well understood. The VARIANZ study aims to assess mechanisms influencing efficacy of trastuzumab in HER2+ GC. Methods: In this multicenter study, patients who receive medical treatment for advanced GC are recruited in 31 sites. The HER2 status is verified centrally by two dedicated GI pathologists using immunohistochemistry (IHC, DCS, HI608C0I) and chromogenic-in-situ hybridization (CISH, Zytomed Systems, C-3022-40). Results: From May 2014 to August 2016, we have enrolled 316 patients in this ongoing project (72% male, median age 64 years). At present, 281 samples were fully characterized for the HER2 status. According to criteria from the Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) study, 53 of 281 samples were characterized HER2+ by central testing. In 38 samples that were diagnosed as HER2+ by local pathologists the HER2 status could not be verified centrally. 7 HER2- probes in local testing were characterized as HER2+ by central testing. The overall deviation rate between local and central testing is 27%. HER2 gene amplification in HER2+ tumors with deviating local report (mean HER2/CEP17: 2.8  0.9, range between 1.9 and 4.5) is lower compared to HER2+ tumors and confirmed local report (mean HER2/CEP17: 5.5  2.6; range between 2.2 and 11.0; p \u003d 0.014). Conclusions: HER2-expression in GC is heterogeneous and still not easy to assess. Variability between local and central HER2 assessment is significant. Robust biomarkers predicting response or resistance to HER2 and other target therapies are needed.
