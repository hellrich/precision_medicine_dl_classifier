Here we present the final 7-year analysis of this pivotal study, the longest follow-up to date of any second-generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Patients (n \u003d 670) with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML in chronic phase received dasatinib. Nineteen percent of patients continued on study treatment, with a greater proportion in the 100 mg once daily arm remaining on therapy. Seven-year rates for major molecular response (MMR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were similar across doses; MMR, PFS, and OS results were 46, 42, and 65% at 100 mg once daily, respectively. Improved PFS and OS rates were reported in patients who achieved BCR-ABL1 ≤10% at 3 and 6 months. No new safety signals were identified. The incidence of drug-related pleural effusion was 28% at 100 mg once daily and 35% at the other three dose groups. Incidence of drug-related pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension remained low (≤3% across all doses). Arterial ischemic events occurred in ≤4% of patients across all doses. These data support the long-term efficacy and well-established safety profile of dasatinib for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML in chronic phase. Am. J.
