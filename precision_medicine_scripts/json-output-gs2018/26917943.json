This oncogene is generated by the fusion of breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and Abelson leukemia virus (ABL) genes and encodes a novel fusion gene translating into a protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. The discovery and introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) irreversibly changed the landscape of CML treatment, leading to dramatic improvement in long-term survival rates. The majority of patients with CML in the chronic phase have a life expectancy comparable with that of healthy age-matched individuals. Although an enormous therapeutic improvement has been accomplished, there are still some unresolved issues in the treatment of patients with CML. One of the most important problems is based on the fact that TKIs can efficiently target proliferating mature cells but do not eradicate leukemic stem cells, allowing persistence of the malignant clone. Owing to the resistance mechanisms arising during the course of the disease, treatment with most of the approved BCR-ABL1 TKIs may become ineffective in a proportion of patients. This article highlights the different molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance being developed during treatment with TKIs as well as the pharmacological strategies to overcome it. Moreover, it gives an overview of novel drugs and therapies that are aiming in overcoming drug resistance, loss of response, and kinase domain mutations.
