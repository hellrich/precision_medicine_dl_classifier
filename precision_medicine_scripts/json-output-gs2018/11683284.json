Tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) signal activation transducing mechanisms are also seriously impaired. Administration of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may lead to APC recovery and interleukin (IL)-2 may restore local TIL activation. Moreover, IL-2 increases the systemic lymphocyte population, an event that seems to correlate with a better prognosis.\nThe present phase I-II study was carried out to examine whether intralesional injection of GM-CSF followed by subcutaneous IL-2 would induce a clinical response in advanced, pretreated elderly melanoma patients.\nSixteen patients over 60 years of age received intralesional GM-CSF (150 ng per lesion on day 1), generally divided between the two largest cutaneous lesions, followed by perilesional subcutaneous IL-2 (3,000,000 IU) for 5 days (days 3-7 inclusive) every 3 weeks.\nFour clinical responses [two partial (PR) and two minimal (MR)] (25%), which also involved lesions that had not been directly treated, and nine cases of stable disease were observed. The response duration for PR and MR was 9, 4, 4 and 2.5 + months, respectively. Stable disease (56%) recorded in the nine patients was short-term (3-6 months). Three patients rapidly progressed after two, two and one therapy cycles, respectively. The patient who reached the best PR had a fairly high absolute lymphocyte count (1600-2400/mm3). The second one, who reached complete remission after subsequent locoregional chemotherapy and hyperthermia, however, had a low absolute lymphocyte count that had doubled by the end of treatment. Blood lymphocyte values in the other patients were too varied to allow any correlation with clinical response. Therapy was well tolerated and only mild fever was observed, with the exception of one patient who had grade 3 fever, with muscle pain and arthralgia.\nConsidering the very low toxicity observed, this treatment might be indicated in elderly patients for whom systemic therapy is no longer a viable option. Improved scheduling and timing could result from further studies.","title":"Intralesional granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor followed by subcutaneous interleukin-2 in metastatic melanoma: a pilot study in elderly patients.","pubmedId":"11683284"}
