We have demonstrated that the progression of human melanoma is associated with loss of expression of the transcription factor AP-2. In metastatic melanoma cells, this loss resulted in overexpression of MCAM/MUC18, MMP-2, the thrombin receptor (PAR-1), and lack of c-KIT expression. The transition from RGP to VGP is also associated with overexpression of the angiogenic factor IL-8. Additionally, the transition of melanoma cells from RGP to VGP is associated with overexpression of the transcription factors CREB and ATF-1, both of which may act as survival factors for human melanoma cells. Inactivation of CREB/ATF-1 activities in metastatic melanoma cells by dominant-negative CREB or by anti-ATF-1 single chain antibody fragment (ScFv), resulted in deregulation of MMP-2 and MCAM/MUC18, increased the sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis, and inhibition of their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in vivo. In this prospect article, we summarize our data on the role of AP-2 and CREB/ATF-1 in the progression of human melanoma and report on the development of new fully human antibodies anti-MCAM/MUC18 and anti-IL-8 which could serve as new modalities for the treatment of melanoma.","title":"Regulation of gene expression in melanoma: new approaches for treatment.","pubmedId":"15523674"}
