The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of DBNL are highly conserved from mammal to yeast and are implicated in a multitude of cellular processes that include, endocytosis, migration, signaling, and viability. Recently, a proteomics analysis identified DBNL as a pro-survival signaling node in various cancers. Here we demonstrate that siRNA knockdown of DBNL reduces ErbB2+ breast cancer viability by arresting cell growth at the G1/S phase and by enhancing caspase-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of DBNL reduces cell surface levels of ErbB2 and decreases Akt phosphorylation. Elucidating the downstream signaling mechanisms that drive DBNL-mediated pro-survival will further aid in identifying new targets to ErbB2+ cancers as well as define additional roles of DBNL in cell biology.","title":"DBNL is a pro-survival adaptor in ErbB2+ breast cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-3905"}
