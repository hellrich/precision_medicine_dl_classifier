Intracellular killing (KI), superoxide anion-producing capacity (SOP), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured in 22 patients with esophageal cancer, 27 with gastric cancer, and 13 age-matched controls. The average level of KI was significantly depressed in patients with esophageal cancer or with gastric cancer, to a similar extent, compared to findings in controls, but SOP was not. In esophageal cancer patients, the SOP level was significantly higher in those with postoperative septic complications than in those without such problems, whereas the KI level was depressed to a similar extent in both. Therefore, a depression of KI with elevation of SOP of PMN may serve to predict complications of infection following surgery in patients with esophageal cancer.","title":"Impaired neutrophil bactericidal activity correlates with the infection occurring after surgery for esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"1331619"}
