The flow cytometry was used to detect leukemia-associated antigen. The used monoclonal antibodys (McAb) included CD10, CD19 and CD34 for B lymphocyte lineage, CD2, CD3 and CD5 for T lymohocyte lineage, MPO, CD13 and CD33 for myeloid lineage. The finally results were respectively analyzed. The results indicated that 9 out of 216 cases of leukemia was diagnosed as BAL (4.2%). Among 9 cases of BAL, 6 cases showed the common expression of myeloid and T lymohocyte lineages (66.7%), 3 cases showed the common expression of myeloid and B lymohocyte lineages (33.3%). 4 cases of BAL displayed CD34 positive expression (44.4%). As compared with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the BAL patients showed higher CD34 positive expression (P \u003c 0.05). It is concluded that the BAL patients show a poor prognosis, as compared with AML or ALL patients. The therapeutic effect of BAL may negatively correlate with the CD34 positive expression.
