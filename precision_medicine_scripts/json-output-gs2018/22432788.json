We analyzed the IDH1 gene mutations frequency in 42 gliomas from 40 children (14 pilocytic astrocytomas; 3 pilomyxoid astrocytomas; 3 diffuse astrocytomas; 1 gliomatosi cerebri; 8 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas; 2 anaplastic astrocytomas; 9 glioblastomas). No IDH1 mutation was detected. Our results indicate that there is no IDH1 gene involvement in the onset and progression of pediatric astrocytomas. We argue that it is not useful in children to assess the status of IDH1 gene nor for diagnostic nor prognostic purposes.","title":"IDH1 mutation in pediatric gliomas: has it a diagnostic and prognostic value?","pubmedId":"22432788"}
