Based on age (young, mid adults, and older adults) at presentation, tumor epicenter was located in iris (21, 4, 2%; P \u003c 0.0001), ciliary body (8, 5, and 7%; P \u003d 0.0225), or choroid (71, 91, and 90%; P \u003c 0.0001). Mean tumor diameter (10.2, 10.8, 11.5 mm; P \u003c 0.0001), mean tumor thickness (5.0, 5.3, 5.7 mm; P \u003c 0.0001), and extraocular extension (1, 2, and 4%; P \u003d 0.0004) increased with age. Kaplan-Meier estimates of tumor-related metastasis at 3, 5, 10, and 20 years were 2%, 9%, 9%, and 20% in young patients (P \u003c 0.011); 6%, 12%, 23%, and 34% in mid adults (P \u003c 0.0001); and 11%, 19%, 28%, and 39% in older adults. Kaplan-Meier estimate of tumor-related death at 3, 5, 10, and 20 years were 0%, 2%, 5%, and 17% in young patients (P \u003d 0.08); 3%, 6%, 11%, and 17% in mid adults (P \u003c 0.001); and 7%, 11%, 16%, and 20% in older adults.\nCompared with mid adults and older adults, young patients manifested a higher proportion of iris melanoma. Compared with older adults, young and mid adults showed smaller melanoma basal dimension and lower tumor-related metastasis and death.","title":"Clinical spectrum and prognosis of uveal melanoma based on age at presentation in 8,033 cases.","pubmedId":"22466491"}
