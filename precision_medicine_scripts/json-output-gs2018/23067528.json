All of the patients underwent whole body FDG-PET scan with a dedicated PET or PET-CT 60 minutes after intravenous injection of 333-434 MBq of (18)F-FDG. Results were confirmed by pathology study in 45.2% of the patients and by clinical follow-up with a mean of 4 years (range: 16 m-8 years)\nSensitivity was 88%, specificity 84.6%, positive predictive value 88%, negative predictive value 84.6% and diagnostic accuracy 87%. The results of the FDG PET modified the therapeutic strategy in 14 cases (45.2%). A comparison was made of the mean values of calcitonin using the Student\u0027s \"t\" test between positive PET studies for the disease and negative ones. No significant differences were found (P\u003d.3).\nIn patients with MTC and suspected recurrence with elevated calcitonin and negative imaging test, the FDG is the best test for the diagnosis of occult recurrence in MTC with elevated calcitonin and negative imaging techniques with elevated clinical impact. It facilitates the therapeutic management of the patients with MTC recurrence, and should be included in the diagnosis algorithm in these patients.","title":"[Evaluation of efficacy and clinical impact of 18F-FDG-PET in the diagnosis of recurrent medullary thyroid cancer with increased calcitonin and negative imaging test].","pubmedId":"23067528"}
