Consecutive patients with NSCLC who underwent treatment with curative intention (118) were included. In 108 cases, the cell cycle was analysed using flow cytometry and double-staining with propidium iodide and anticytokeratin. In another 108 cases, expression of erbB1, erbB2 and P53 was assessed immunhistochemically. Amplification of the erbB family was determined in the tumours of 53 patients using double-differential polymerase chain reaction. Of the tumours, 81% were aneuploid and 14% showed positive staining for erbB1, 18% for erbB2 and 41% for P53. There were normal mean gene copy numbers in 86% for erbB1, 94% for erbB2 and in 96% for erbB3. No significant correlations were noted between erbB1, erbB2 and P53 expression, ploidy status and tumour stage. In a Cox regression model, only tumour stage was shown to be prognostically significant. It seems that ploidy and expression status of erbB1, erbB2 and P53 are not prognostic parameters in non-small cell lung cancer. Amplification of the erbB family does not seem to be a frequent event in non-small cell lung cancer.","title":"Ploidy, expression of erbB1, erbB2, P53 and amplification of erbB1, erbB2 and erbB3 in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"11153605"}
