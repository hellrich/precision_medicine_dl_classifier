Abnormal p53 protein expression and gene mutations have been identified in a number of different canine tumour types. However, mdm2 gene amplification has only been investigated in a limited number of canine osteosarcomas. In this present study a series of canine soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) were examined for p53 mutations and/or mdm2 amplification. For p53 mutational studies polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing was used. Gene mutations were identified in 6 of 30 (20%) primary tumour cases including MPNST (n\u003d3) leiomysarcoma (n\u003d1), heamangiosarcoma (n\u003d1) and sarcoma (n\u003d1). mdm2 gene amplification was assessed by Southern Blot. Although there was no evidence for major gene rearrangements, gene amplification was detected in 4 of 35 (11.4 %) primary tumours including MPNST (n\u003d2), rhabdomyosarcoma (n\u003d2). A total of 33 cases were examined for both p53 mutations and mdm2 amplification. Seven of the tumours were positive for p53 mutations, while five were positive for mdm2 amplification. With the exception of one case, a reciprocal relationship between the presence of a p53 mutation and mdm2 gene amplification was demonstrated.","title":"Analysis of p53 mutational events and MDM2 amplification in canine soft-tissue sarcomas.","pubmedId":"11675155"}
