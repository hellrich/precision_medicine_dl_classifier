Examination of vaginal smears showed persistent estrus in adult rats treated prenatally with DES. Compensatory ovarian hypertrophy (COH) induced by hemicastration of these rats was not suppressed by estrogens. A per oral test for glucose-tolerance revealed decreased utilization of glucose in the offspring of DES-treated rats. Preliminary observations demonstrated that tumors developed in 14 of 18 (77.8%) progeny transplacentally expoed to DES and in 9 of 34 (26.5%) intact control rats. Tumors of the ovary and the endometrium were found only in the rats treated prenatally with DES; no tumors of the uterine cervix or vagina were observed in either experimental or control groups. It is suggested that a transplacental effect of DES in the female is impairment of the sex differentiation of the hypothalamus. The resulting hormonal and metabolic shifts might promote tumorigenesis.","title":"Transplacental effect of diethylstilbestrol in female rats.","pubmedId":"436110"}
