This review summarizes the major risk factors for AML. We searched the literature using PubMed for articles on childhood AML and reviewed 180 articles. While few risk factors are definitive, we identified several with consistent evidence of a possible effect. Thorough analysis of genetic and epigenetic factors is missing from this literature and methodological issues are unresolved. Future studies should more closely examine causal mechanisms, improve exposure measurement, and include analysis using genetic and epigenetic factors.","title":"Epidemiology of childhood acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"23303597"}
