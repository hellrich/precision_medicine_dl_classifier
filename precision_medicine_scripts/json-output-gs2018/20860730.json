Its incidence ranges from 1 to 50% and depends on the specific type of leukemia. Leukemic vasculitis represents a rare form of leukemia cutis consisting of the involvement and destruction of vessel walls by leukemic cells, which in themselves cause the vascular injury. To date, only few cases of leukemic vasculitis have been described. Here, we report two cases of this rare skin condition, one of which mimicked cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa.","title":"Leukemic vasculitis: a rare pattern of leukemia cutis.","pubmedId":"20860730"}
