Despite intensive research, the prognosis of SCLC remains poor, and therefore new strategies to improve outcome are urgently needed. Blockade of immune checkpoints PD-1/PD-L1 with monoclonal antibodies has recently emerged as a new therapeutic tool in oncology. Due to the difficulty in obtaining adequate tissue in diseases such as SCLC for PD-L1 expression assessment, we investigated the usefulness of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection as a non-invasive method to evaluate PD-L1 status in SCLC patients.Materials and Methods: CTC capture and PD-L1 expression was evaluated in a cohort of 18 SCLC patients for whom resected tissue specimens were available and were positive for CTCs, as detected by using the filtration-based ISET platform (Rarecells Diagnostics, Paris, France). PD-L1 expression was evaluated in ISET-captured CTCs and FFPE tissue sections by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the SP142 rabbit monoclonal antibody (Spring Bioscience, USA). PD-L1 expression was scored on tumor cells (TC350% positive tumor cells; TC25% but \u003c50% positive tumor cells; TC11% but \u003c5% of positive tumor cells; and TC0\u003c1% positive tumor cells) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC310% of positive immune cells; IC25% but \u003c10% of positive immune cells; IC1 1% but \u003c5% of positive immune cells; and IC0\u003c 1% of positive immune cells).Results: None of the SCLC cases showed PD-L1 protein expression in tumor cells on tissue specimens. PD-L1 expression was observed in the stroma. Using IHC assay, 67% of cases (8/12) were scored IC1-3 based on PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells and 42% (5/12) were scored IC2/3. On the ISET platform, CTCs enumeration ranged from 3 to 637 CTCs/6 ml, with median 11 CTCs/6 ml, and clusters of CTCs in 83% of patients. No PD-L1 expression was observed in CTCs. However, 42% of cases showed PD-L1 expression in circulating immune cells, with PD-L1 status on filters being concordant with the IC2/3 status in patient-matched tumor tissue.Conclusion: PD-L1 seems expressed in only a fraction of SCLC, with carcinoma cells being negative in all cases, and PD-L1 expressed in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Patients with stromal PD-L1 expression may potentially respond to anti-PD-1 treatment. Besides conventional IHC, ISET platform seems suitable for non-invasive real-time detection of circulating PD-L1 expression to determine PD-L1 status of SCLC patients entering clinical trials.","title":"PD-L1 expression in primary tumor and circulating tumor cells in patients with small cell lung carcinomas","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2220"}
