In 1979, 260 histologically proven primary cutaneous malignant melanomas of the skin presented. This represents an incidence of 5.1/10(5) for Scotland as a whole. Studies over the next 5 years will determine whether the incidence of melanoma is rising in Scotland as rapidly as in other parts of the world.","title":"Cutaneous malignant melanoma in Scotland.","pubmedId":"7104199"}
