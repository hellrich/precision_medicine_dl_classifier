Tumors with diverse clinical risk showed differences affecting CpG and, remarkably, non-CpG sites. Non-CpG methylation observed essentially in clinically favorable cases was associated with the differentiation status of neuroblastoma and expression of key genes such as ALK.\nThis epigenetic fingerprint of neuroblastoma provides new insights into the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of this pediatric tumor.","title":"DNA methylation fingerprint of neuroblastoma reveals new biological and clinical insights.","pubmedId":"26067621"}
