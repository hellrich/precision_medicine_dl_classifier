Immunohistochemical EnVision staining, fluorescent PCR detection, and FISH were used to characterize tumor samples and the literature was reviewed.\nOf the 12 ACC cases (7 male; average 53.1 years-of-age; range 33-78 years), the chief presentation symptom was cough, followed by expectoration, gasping, and bloody sputum. Microscopically, histopathology revealed cribriform, tubular, or solid cords. CD117 was overexpressed in glandular epithelia in 9 cases and calcitonin and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) were overexpressed in 4 cases. One case was positive for EML4 ALK gene rearrangement.\nACC is a low-grade malignant tumor with poor prognosis and high recurrence and metastases. TTF-1 expression indicates a primary tumor and CD117 expression is not significant to prognosis.","title":"Primary pulmonary adenoid cystic carcinoma: clinicopathological analyses of 12 cases.","pubmedId":"26261681"}
