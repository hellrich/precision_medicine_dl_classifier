All the cases of primary melanoma examined showed a reduced expression of DNA repair genes. These results demonstrate that disturbances of DNA repair begin in the early stages of melanoma. No significant differences were found in the expression of these markers between cutaneous melanomas and their recurrences and metastases (P\u003e 0.05). Eighteen significant correlations between markers were found in the primary melanomas, and 10 significant correlations were observed in the first recurrences of melanoma. In contrast, 27 statistically significant relationships were demonstrated in metastatic lymph nodes. The different correlations found in primary and metastatic tumours confirmed the hypothetical difference in marker interaction in the diagnostic groups investigated. Our results suggest that DNA repair genes may play an important role in the recurrence and metastasis of melanomas.","title":"Comparative study of the expression of DNA mismatch repair genes, the adenomatous polyposis coli gene and growth arrest DNA damage genes in melanoma recurrences and metastases.","pubmedId":"11198475"}
