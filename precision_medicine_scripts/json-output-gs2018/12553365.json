The most common primary lesion sites are the palate and gingiva. Melanoma of the tongue is specifically uncommon. A 66-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with a complaint of a huge, painless, black, discolored mass on the right side of the oral tongue for 7 years. There were no cutaneous lesions suggestive of malignant melanoma over the rest of her body. The biopsy of the tongue lesion revealed a histopathology consistent with primary malignant melanoma. Computed tomography of the neck showed no significant cervical lymphadenopathy. Chest radiograph, whole body bone scanning, and abdominal sonography revealed no definite distal metastatic lesions. She received composite resection of the tumor on the right side of the tongue and right functional neck dissection. The patient had an uneventful recovery and received regular follow-up examinations. She was free of disease for more than 2 years. The treatment principle for primary tongue melanoma is wide surgical excision. Early diagnosis will be promoted by careful oral examination and early biopsy of pigmented and non-pigmented masses. We reviewed the published reports in the English literature since 1970 and fewer than 30 cases of primary tongue melanoma were presented. We present a case report and a review of the relevant literature.","title":"Primary malignant melanoma of the tongue.","pubmedId":"12553365"}
