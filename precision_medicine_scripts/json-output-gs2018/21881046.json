Clinical analysis was mainly carried out among 605 cases without recognizable karyotype abnormalities except for 11q23. Of these 605 patients, 452 (74.7%) were found to have at least 1 mutation, and the relationship of gene mutations with clinical outcome was investigated. We revealed a correlation pattern among NPM1, DNMT3A, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, CEBPA, and TET2 mutations. Multivariate analysis identified DNMT3A and MLL mutations as independent factors predicting inferior overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS), whereas biallelic CEBPA mutations or NPM1 mutations without DNMT3A mutations conferred a better OS and EFS in both the whole group and among younger patients \u003c 60 years of age. The use of molecular markers allowed us to subdivide the series of 605 patients into distinct prognostic groups with potential clinical relevance.","title":"Gene mutation patterns and their prognostic impact in a cohort of 1185 patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"21881046"}
