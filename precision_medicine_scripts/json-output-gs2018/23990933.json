A meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed using standard statistical methods to clarify the association between SOX2 expression and these clinical parameters.\nA total of eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of these data showed that SOX2 expression was positively associated with squamous histology, (pooled OR \u003d 5.26, 95% CI: 1.08-25.6, P \u003d 0.040). Simultaneously, we also found that SOX2 expression was positively associated with overall survival (pooled HR \u003d 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.89, P \u003d 0.007, random-effect).\nSOX2 expression in tumor is a candidate positive prognostic biomarker for NSCLC patients.","title":"The prognostic value of SOX2 expression in non-small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"23990933"}
