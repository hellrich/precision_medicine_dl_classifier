The bone marrow of 216 patients with AML were detected by using PCR and R-banding methods. On basis of patients\u0027 clinical data the clinical feature and prognosis were analyzed. The results showed that in 216 AML patients incidence of FLT3-ITD mutation was 20.83%. FLT3-ITD mutation was present in 24% patients with normal karyotype while in 12.5% patients with abnormal karyotype. The FLT3-ITD positive patients had more white blood cells in peripheral blood and leukemia cells in bone marrow (P \u003c 0.01). The free-disease survival and overall survival time were shorter in FLT3-ITD positive cases than that in FLT3-ITD negative cases (P \u003c 0.05). It is concluded that FLT3-ITD mutation positive patients have more white blood cells in peripheral blood and leukemia cells in bone marrow. The FLT3-ITD mutation may be a danger factor in the AML patients with normal karyotype. It may be helpful for evaluating prognosis and guiding individual treatment of AML.","title":"[Detection and clinical significance of FLT3-ITD gene mutation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia].","pubmedId":"23257423"}
