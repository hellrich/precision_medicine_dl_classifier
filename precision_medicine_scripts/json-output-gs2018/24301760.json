In this study, a BRAF V600E mutation was detected in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded PTC samples using multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. The sensitivity of the assays was validated in two cell lines, K1 and RO82-W-1, which were respectively positive and negative for the mutation. The method enabled detection of very low concentrations (~1%) of the mutation, with positive findings obtained in 119 of the 187 samples (63.6%). The mutation was not detected in 20 cases of benign thyroid diseases. The presence of the mutation was significantly associated with ages \u003e45 years, the tumor-nodes-metastasis stage, region of metastasis, and clinical outcome (P \u003c 0.05). Although no correlation was found between the mutation and lymph node metastasis, the proportions of patients carrying a mutation differed significantly between central and lateral cervical lymph node metastasis (P \u003c 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also indicated the presence of mutation, tumor size, and cervical lymph node metastasis to be independent predictors for recurrence and distant metastasis. We conclude that a high proportion of PTC cases likely harbors the BRAF V600E mutation. This mutation can be used as an independent factor for predicting the recurrence and distal metastasis of PTC tumors.
