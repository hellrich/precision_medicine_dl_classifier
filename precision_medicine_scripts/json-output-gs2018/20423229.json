It has recently been suggested that CpG-ODNs may also enhance sensitivity to traditional therapies including chemotherapy in certain cancer-cell lines. The purpose of this study was to define the activity of CpG-ODN7909 in increasing radiosensitivity of the human non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 in vitro. First, a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on cell viability was observed after A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of CpG-ODN7909 (5, 10, 30, and 60 microg/mL). Second, decreased cell clonogenic survival, enhanced cell apoptotic index, accumulated percentage of cells in the G2/M phase, and increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secretion were found after combined treatments with 10 microg/mL of CpG-ODN7909 and radiation compared to either treatment alone (p \u003c 0.05). Furthermore, the toll-like receptor 9 mRNA was found to express in A549. The results suggest that CpG-ODN7909 can increase the radiosensitivity of human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells, which may be associated with reduced cell clonogenic survival, enhanced apoptosis, prolonged cell-cycle arrest in G2/M, and stimulation of TNF-alpha secretion.","title":"Enhancement of radiosensitivity by CpG-oligodeoxyribonucleotide-7909 in human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells.","pubmedId":"20423229"}
