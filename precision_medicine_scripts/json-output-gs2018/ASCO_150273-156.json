The -catenin signaling pathway plays a role in dendritic cell (DC) tolerization and regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation however the factors responsible for inducing this pathway are unknown.  Methods:   We utilized a BRAFV600EPTEN-/- autochthonous model of melanoma to identify melanoma-derived factors capable of driving local Treg development and the generation of an immunotolerant microenvironment. Primary human melanoma specimens were examined for expression of these candidate factors by immunohistochemistry while sentinel lymph node-derived DCs were analyzed for expression of downstream mediators of the identified signaling pathway. Based on this data, a small molecule inhibitor of the candidate signaling pathway was tested to augment the anti-tumor immune response of checkpoint inhibitors in a murine melanoma model.   Results:    We identified the Wnt5a ligand as a critical mediator -catenin signaling in DCs and of Treg generation in the BRAFV600EPTEN-/-model. We further determined Wnt5a to be associated with expression of the Treg marker, FoxP3, in human melanoma tissues and for Wnt5a expression by primary melanomas to be associated with an improved objective response to anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy. In addition, our work suggests that activation of the -catenin signaling pathway in sentinel lymph node derived DCs correlates with higher tumor burden and inferior clinical outcome. Finally, we show that suppressing Wnt ligand secretion and downstream signaling by targeting the Porcn acyl transferase enzyme functions to enhance the anti-melanoma immune response and suppress melanoma growth when administered in combination with anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy.   Conclusions:   The Wnt5a--catenin signaling pathway represents a novel pharmacological target within the melanoma microenvironment that is worthy of further investigation in combination immunotherapy clinical trials.","title":"Targeting the Wnt5a--catenin pathway in the melanoma microenvironment to augment checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150273-156"}
