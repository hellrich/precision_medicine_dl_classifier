Osteoporosis is diagnosed by bone mineral density measurement (T-score of -2.5 or below) also in men. However, most of the studies carried out in the last decade focused on pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in women. In spite of this, recent epidemiological and observational studies have shown that osteoporosis in men is an increasingly important clinical issue. In part because the world population is aging, it is likely that the total number of hip fractures in men in 2025 will be similar to current estimates in women. Furthermore 25-33% of men in some populations will sustain osteoporotic fractures in their lifetime. Nevertheless, male osteoporosis is still underdiagnosed and further studies are required to clarify the pathogenesis and find out the right therapy. Prevention and early diagnosis are, nowadays, the best ways of treatment.","title":"Male osteoporosis.","pubmedId":"20046161"}
