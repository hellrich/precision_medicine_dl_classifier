Therefore, tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used for the treatment of advanced metastatic thyroid carcinoma. The aim is to present a case of metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma responding to the administration of sunitinib, a multi-targeted protein kinase inhibitor. A patient presented with metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma and hyperthyroidism. After euthyroidism was achieved the patient was treated by the administration of therapeutic radioiodine (131)I, radiotherapy and sunitinib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Thyroglobulin levels decreased from 9,594 to 6,816 ng/ml after 1 month, 6 months later being 2,776 ng/ml. The lesion in the pelvis was 12.5 Ã— 9 cm before treatment decreasing thereafter and the patient improved clinically. The administration of sunitinib resulted in partial disease response in a patient with progressive metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. Protein kinase inhibitors may prove useful in the management of advanced metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"Partial remission of metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma with sunitinib.
