Ten chimeric 2\u0027-O-methoxyethyl (MoE)-modified hemimers were synthesized that targeted various regions from the 5\u0027- to the 3\u0027-end of Hdm2 mRNA. The IC50 of the most potent ASO, NCH-4401, was subsequently determined and compared to the IC50 of a 2\u0027-MoE-modified ASO, with a complete phosphorothioate backbone (NCH-4668), and to a 3 bp mismatched ASO (NCH4529). NCH4401 inhibited Hdm2 expression in SJSA-1 cells with an IC50 of 120 nm, whereas NCH-4668 was less potent with an IC50 of 180 nm. The mismatched control ASO was completely inactive, indicating a sequence-dependent mechanism of action of NCH-4401. NCH4401 was subsequently used to study the consequences of inhibiting Hdm2 expression in human osteosarcoma cells. NCH-4401 completely inhibited Hdm2 protein expression in SJSA-1 cells at a concentration of 300 nm, already 4 h after start of ASO treatment. At an ASO concentration of 300 nM, p53 protein was induced 12.5-fold and p21 was induced 8-fold over background levels, 24 h after start of ASO treatment. The dramatic induction of p53 in SJSA-1 cells prompted us to investigate whether the accumulation of p53 in these cells was followed by induction of apoptosis. However, no signs for apoptosis were detected in SJSA-1 cells, following induction of wild-type p53 using the Yopro method and the induction of caspase-3 activity. SJSA-1 cells were subsequently treated with NCH-4401 at different concentrations in combination with two well-known DNA-damaging agents, i.e. carboplatin and mitomycin C. Apoptosis induction following treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents and NCH4401 was determined in parallel by measuring caspase-3 activation and uptake of the DNA dye Yopro. Carboplatin and mitomycin C together only slightly induced apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells to a factor of approximately 2-fold, as measured by the induction of caspase-3 activity. The downregulation of Hdm2 expression by NCH4401 did not induce apoptosis on its own and did not potentiate the mitomycin C/carboplatin-induced programmed cell death.","title":"Consequences of the inhibition of Hdm2 expression in human osteosarcoma cells using antisense oligonucleotides.","pubmedId":"11716435"}
