Cells were subjected to different combinations of starvation (growth factors and/or aminoacids withdrawal), paclitaxel treatment and Bcl-2 silencing by siRNA. Cell viability was evaluated by Trypan Blue dye exclusion assay, Propidium Iodide (PI) and Annexin-V/PI staining.\nWe assessed the sensitivity of different prostate cancer cell lines to starvation and we observed a differential response correlated to the levels of Akt activation. The four prostate cancer cell lines also showed different sensitivity to taxol treatments; LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells were more resistant to paclitaxel than DU145 and PC3 cells. Combining taxol with growth factors and aminoacids deprivation leaded to a more than additive reduction of cell viability compared to single treatments in PTEN-mutant LNCaP cells. Down-modulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein by siRNA sensitized LNCaP cells to taxanes and starvation induced cell death.\nSilencing Bcl-2 in PTEN-mutated prostate cancer cells enhances the apoptotic effects of combined starvation and taxol treatments, indicating that inhibition of Bcl-2 may be of significant value in PTEN-mutant tumor therapy.","title":"Down-modulation of Bcl-2 sensitizes PTEN-mutated prostate cancer cells to starvation and taxanes.","pubmedId":"25111376"}
