The impact of the HDAC6 selective inhibitor ACY1215 was explored on immune cell biology, with novel implications for the treatment of melanoma patient T cells ex vivo prior to adoptive transfer. Methods: T cells were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors and melanoma patients. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were isolated from surgical biopsies. Cells were treated ex vivo with ACY1215 or DMSO control. Viability was addressed by MTS colorimetric assay. Cytokine levels were evaluated by Luminex. Expression of T cell markers and IFN/CD107a production were assessed by flow cytometry. T cell cytotoxicity was determined by co-culture of TILs and melanoma and analysis of annexin V and propidium iodide. Affymetrix based microarray was performed on TILs for gene expression analysis. Statistical significance of DMSO vs ACY1215 treated T cells was based on paired, two-tailed, students t-test. Results: ACY1215 was unique among pan and selective HDAC inhibitors in modulating T cell function, with minimal impact on viability. Treatment of melanoma patient-derived T cells reduced Th2 cytokine production (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10; p \u003c 0.01) and maintained Th1 effector cytokine levels (IFN, IL-2). ACY1215 increased expression of the activation/costimulatory markers CD69 and ICOS (p \u003c 0.05), and enhanced a central memory phenotype expressed by healthy and melanoma patient CD4 and CD8 T cells during ex vivo expansion (p \u003c 0.05), as determined by expression of CD45RO, CD45RA, CD62L and CCR7. In fact, ACY1215 increased central memory TILs derived from multiple cell preparations (e.g. pre and post rapid in vitro expansion; p \u003c 0.05). ACY1215 treated TILs exhibited higher levels of IFN/CD107a expressing CD8 T cells (50% vs 35%, p \u003c 0.05), and enhanced cytotoxicity (50% vs 70% killing of HLA matched targets with DMSO vs ACY1215 treated TILs). Microarray analysis revealed increased expression of genes associated with an inflammatory response and T cell memory in ACY1215 treated TILs. Conclusions: ACY1215 augmented T cell proliferation and function during ex vivo expansion, with possible translatable clinical implications.","title":"Selective histone deacetylase inhibition augments melanoma immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_170144-176"}
