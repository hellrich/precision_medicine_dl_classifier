Prostate specific antigen was sensitive in detecting prostatic cancer. The levels of prostate specific antigen were elevated in 10 per cent of the patients with stage A, 24 per cent with stage B, 53 per cent with stage C and 92 per cent with stage D disease. However, prostate specific antigen levels also were elevated in 9 per cent of the patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy. This lack of specificity in the presence of benign prostatic hypertrophy probably precludes prostate specific antigen from being recommended as a screening test for prostatic cancer. The ultimate role of prostate specific antigen might be as the marker of choice to monitor therapy for prostatic carcinoma.","title":"An evaluation of prostate specific antigen in prostatic cancer.","pubmedId":"2435927"}
