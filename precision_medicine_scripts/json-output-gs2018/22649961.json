Amelanotic malignant melanoma (AMM) lacks the pigmented elements, which is the hallmark of melanoma. This is a challenging diagnosis since confusion might be made with a variety of benign lesions, causing a delay in appropriate medical treatment. Taking into consideration that prognosis is the same for melanotic and amelanotic melanoma, early diagnosis is crucial. We describe a patient with amelanotic melanoma of the penis, treated with partial penectomy.","title":"Amelanotic malignant melanoma of the penis.
