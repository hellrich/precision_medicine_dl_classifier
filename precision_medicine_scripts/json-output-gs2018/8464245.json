First, the BCR/ABL rearrangement was identified as the molecular basis of the disease. Second, animal models support the notion that the BCR/ABL gene product causes a syndrome similar to CML. Third, recent advances in understanding the functions of the normal ABL protein have given clues to the mechanism(s) of ABL-induced leukemias and approaches to blocking this process. Extrapolating these findings to humans seems reasonable. The challenge now is to determine how the BCR/ABL gene product causes chronic phase CML. Also unresolved is whether BCR/ABL also plays a role in the acute phase of the disease. Finally, the relationship between the two common forms of BCR/ABL, the P190 and P210 configurations, and different disease phenotypes, like CML and Philadelphia (Ph1)-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), needs to be clarified. There is also substantial progress in treating CML. Bone marrow transplants have emerged as the preferred therapy. These result in long-term leukemia-free survival in more than one-half of appropriately selected subjects. How transplants cure CML is complex and controversial. Some data suggest high-dose treatment is the dominant factor whereas other data implicate antileukemia effects of the immune system. Interferon treatment has also proven effective in CML. Whether it prolongs survival of persons with CML remains to be determined, as does its mechanism of action. Certainly the most important and difficult challenge in CML therapy is determining how to use knowledge about the causes CML to treat the disease. These and other issues in the biology and therapy of CML were the subject of a recent meeting of basic and clinical scientists. The meeting, third in a series begun in 1987, was held on Martha\u0027s Vineyard, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 4-7 April, 1992. Four major topics were considered in five sessions: molecular biology, cell biology, Ph1-chromosome positive ALL, and therapy of CML. This report summarizes meeting highlights.","title":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia: biology and therapy.","pubmedId":"8464245"}
