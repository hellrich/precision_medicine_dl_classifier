This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of crizotinib and pemetrexed-based chemotherapy in Chinese NSCLC patients with ROS1 rearrangement.\nA total of 2309 patients received ROS1 fusion detection and 51(2.2%) patients had ROS1 rearrangement. There was no significant difference between ROS1 fusion-positive and fusion-negative cohorts in demographic data. For the ROS1 fusion-positive patients, crizotinb-treated group had a higher overall response rate (ORR, 80.0%), disease control rate (DCR, 90.0%) and longer progression-free survival (PFS, 294 days) compared with the rates in pemetrexed-treated group (ORR, 40.8%; DCR, 71.4%; PFS, 179 days) and non-pemetrexed-treated group (ORR, 25.0%; DCR, 47.7%; PFS, 110 days). Besides, ORR, DCR and PFS were similar in three major ROS1 fusion partners. For the first-line treatment, patients received pemetrexed had a significant longer PFS than those received non-pemetrexed chemotherapy (209 vs. 146 days, P \u003d 0.0107). In pemetrexed-treated cohorts, ROS1-positive patients with low TS expression had a statistically significant longer PFS than those with high TS expression (184 vs. 110 days, P \u003d 0.0105).\nWe retrospectively identified patients with NSCLC who were screened for ROS1 fusion using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from October 2013 to February 2016. The thymidylate synthase (TS) mRNA levels were tested using quantitative real-time RT-PCR.\nCrizotinib was also highly active at treating Chinese NSCLC patients with ROS1 rearrangement. TS expression could predict the efficacy of pemetrexed-based therapy in ROS1 fusion-positive patients.","title":"Efficacy of crizotinib and pemetrexed-based chemotherapy in Chinese NSCLC patients with ROS1 rearrangement.","pubmedId":"27738334"}
