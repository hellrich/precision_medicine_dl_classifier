No study on the pathogenesis of Barrett\u0027s esophageal cancer in comparison with GE junction adenocarcinoma other than Barrett\u0027s esophageal cancer has been reported in Japan. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and pathological characteristics and gastric acid secretion of Barrett\u0027s esophageal cancer and GE junction adenocarcinoma other than Barrett\u0027s esophageal cancer in Japanese subjects.\nTwenty-three patients with Barrett\u0027s esophageal cancer and 23 patients with GE junction adenocarcinoma other than Barrett\u0027s esophageal cancer were enrolled in this study. We evaluated and compared them by assessing the Helicobactor pylori (HP) infection status and gastric acid secretion using the endoscopic gastrin test (EGT).\nIn the patients with Barrett\u0027s esophageal cancer, no significant difference was found in the mean EGT value between HP-positive and -negative patients, but in the patients with GE junction adenocarcinoma other than Barrett\u0027s esophageal cancer, the mean EGT value in HP-positive patients was significantly lower than that in HP-negative patients.\nTwo distinct types of cancer of different origin may be mixed in GE junction adenocarcinomas. One is Barrett\u0027s esophageal cancer associated with high gastric acid secretion and reflux of gastric acid into the esophagus, the other is cancer resembling distal gastric cancer associated with gastric atrophy and low gastric acid secretion.","title":"Two distinct types of cancer of different origin may be mixed in gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas in Japan: evidence from direct evaluation of gastric acid secretion.","pubmedId":"21446884"}
