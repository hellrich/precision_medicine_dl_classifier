To the best of our knowledge, there have been no English-language reports on its cytologic findings.\nA fine needle aspiration specimen from a mass of the thyroid in a 59-year-old female showed a large collection of dense, inspissated colloid and a few sheets of tumor cells with nuclei characteristic of papillary carcinoma. There were no three-dimensional, branching papillae with fibrovascular cores.\nAlthough macrofollicular variant of papillary carcinoma is very rare, fine needle aspiration cytology may contribute to its correct diagnosis.","title":"Macrofollicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
