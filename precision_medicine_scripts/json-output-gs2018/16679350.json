Regarding head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the only known risk factor is the presence of \u003e or \u003d3 tumour-positive lymph nodes.\nTo evaluate whether a HNSCC gene expression signature can discriminate between the patients with and without distant metastases.\nPatients with HNSCC with and without distant metastases had \u003e3 tumour-positive lymph nodes, and did not differ with respect to other risk factors. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student\u0027s t test, as well as statistical analysis of microarrays (SAM), to assess the false discovery rate for each gene. These analyses were supplemented with a newly developed method that computed deviations from gaussian-order statistics (DEGOS). To validate the platform, normal mucosa of the head and neck was included as control.\n2963 genes were differently expressed between HNSCC and normal mucosa (t test; p\u003c0.01). More rigorous statistical analysis with SAM confirmed the differential expression of most genes. The comparison of genes in HNSCC with and without metastases showed 150 differently expressed genes (t test; p\u003c0.01), none of which, however, could be confirmed using SAM or DEGOS.\nNo evidence for a metastasis signature is found, and gene expression profiling of HNSCC has seemingly no value in determining the risk of developing distant metastases. The absence of such a signature can be understood when it is realised that, for HNSCC in contrast with breast cancer, the lymph nodes are a necessary in-between station for haematogenous spread.","title":"Expression profiling and prediction of distant metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16679350"}
