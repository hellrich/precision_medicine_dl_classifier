The median survival time and the 1-, 2-, 3- year survival rates of the two groups were compared by the Kaplan-Meier method.\nThe median survival time of the operation group was 20.3 months, and the 1-, 2-, 3- year survival rates were 85%, 70%, and 35% respectively. The median survival time of the non-operation group was 14.5 months and the 1-, 2-, 3- year survival rates were 75%, 33%, and 15% respectively.\nThe therapeutic result of the operation combined chemotherapy for the stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer is better than that of the non-operative therapy obviously.","title":"[Clinical analysis of operation combined chemotherapy for stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"16318812"}
