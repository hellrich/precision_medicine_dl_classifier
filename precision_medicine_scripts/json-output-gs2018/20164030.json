Helicobacter pylori infection is known to contribute significantly to the formation and progression of gastric cancer. However, the mechanisms responsible for this process have not been yet elucidated. We analysed the relationship between H. pylori infection and expression of proteins belonging to the family of epidermal growth factor (EGF, EGFR, c-erbB-2). Fifty-five patients with gastric cancer were analysed for Helicobacter pylori infection. The expressions of EGF, EGFR, c-erbB-2 proteins were determined using an immunohistochemical method. No statistically significant correlation was found between the degree of H. pylori infection and the expressions of EGF, EGFR and c-erbB-2 in gastric cancer. However, c-erbB-2 expression in the main mass of tumour correlated with tumour expression of EGF and EGFR and with c-erbB-2 expression in local lymph nodes. The expression of c-erbB-2 in lymph nodes was statistically significantly related to the expressions of EGF and EGFR both in the main mass of tumour and in lymph nodes. The expression of EGF was found to correlate with EGFR in the main mass of tumour and the expression of EGF in lymph nodes was related to lymph node EGFR level. Our study did not confirm the relationship between H. pylori infection and the expression of epidermal growth factor in gastric cancer.","title":"Helicobacter pylori infection and expressions of EGF, EGFR and c-erbB-2 proteins in gastric carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20164030"}
