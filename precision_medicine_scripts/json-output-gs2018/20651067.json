To investigate their prognostic significance we determined IDH1 status in 1333 young adult patients, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, treated in the United Kingdom MRC AML10 and 12 trials. A mutation was detected in 107 patients (8%). Most IDH1(+) patients (91%) had intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Mutations correlated significantly with an NPM1 mutation (P \u003c .0001) but not a FLT3/ITD (P \u003d .9). No difference in outcome between IDH1(+) and IDH1(-) patients was found in univariate or multivariate analysis, or if the results were stratified by NPM1 mutation status. However, when stratified by FLT3/ITD status, an IDH1 mutation was an independent adverse factor for relapse in FLT3/ITD(-) patients (P \u003d .008) and a favorable factor in FLT3/ITD(+) patients (P \u003d .02). These results suggest that metabolic changes induced by an IDH1 mutation may influence chemoresistance in a manner that is context-dependent.","title":"The prognostic significance of IDH1 mutations in younger adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia is dependent on FLT3/ITD status.","pubmedId":"20651067"}
