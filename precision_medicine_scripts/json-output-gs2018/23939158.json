Of all the subjects, 169 developed malignancy, of whom 9 patients developed other multiple malignant tumors occurring with UC, 8 patients were female and 1 male. The median age was 55 years (49-67 years), and the median diagnosis time of tumor after surgery was 38 months (8-80 months). All of them received operation as therapy.\nIn 9 patients other multiple malignancy occurred with UC: 2 urothelial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 2 sarcoma, 2 colon adenocarcinoma, 1 skin SCC, 1 poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma combined with micro-papillary carcinoma of bladder and 1 renal chromophobe cell carcinoma. Of the 9 patients, 7 were alive in postoperative follow-ups for 32-172 months, of whom 2 received hemodialysis after the removal of dysfunctional allograft, and 5 were alive with functioned allograft. Two patients died of tumor metastasis in 6 months after operations.\nThe multiple accompanying malignancy can happen in patients who have developed UC after renal transplantation. The possibility of multiple malignancy occurrences should be regarded among renal transplant recipients, since early diagnosis and treatment are essential to the improvement in the survival of the patients.","title":"[Urothelial carcinoma accompanied with other malignant tumor after renal transplantation: 9 cases report].","pubmedId":"23939158"}
