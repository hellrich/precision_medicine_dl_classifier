Its clinical and biological behavior show a remarkable heterogeneity, ranging from spontaneous regression to inexorable progression with a fatal outcome. This review summarizes the clinical risk stratification and treatment options. An extensive overview of the role of imaging during the course of the disease and typical imaging findings in all imaging modalities are demonstrated.","title":"Neuroblastoma imaging.","pubmedId":"21170823"}
