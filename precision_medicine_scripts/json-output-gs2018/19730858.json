The meloe gene is overexpressed in melanomas as compared to other cancer cell lines and normal tissues. The corresponding transcript is rather unusual, in that it does not contain a long unique ORF but multiple short ORFs. We recently characterized a tumor epitope derived from a polypeptide (MELOE-1) encoded by the ORF(1230-1370) and involved in relapse prevention of melanoma patients treated with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Here we show that the ORF(285-404) encodes a polypeptide called MELOE-2 that also generated a HLA-A2 epitope recognized by a melanoma-specific T cell clone derived from the same TIL population from which we derived the MELOE-1-specific T cell clone. We also showed that HLA-A2 melanoma cells were spontaneously recognized by the MELOE-2-specific T cell clone, and we detected the presence of MELOE-2 reactive T cells in another TIL population infused to a patient who remained relapse-free after TIL treatment. These results demonstrate that translation of meloe transcript in melanoma cells can produce at least two immunogenic polypeptides, MELOE-1 and MELOE-2, from two distinct ORFs that could be relevant target for melanoma immunotherapy.","title":"An additional ORF on meloe cDNA encodes a new melanoma antigen, MELOE-2, recognized by melanoma-specific T cells in the HLA-A2 context.","pubmedId":"19730858"}
