MET is involved in tumor differentiation \u0026 VEGFR2 is a mediator of angiogenesis. Erlotinib (E) is FDA approved for the treatment of NSCLC.  Methods:  The primary objective of this randomized phase II study was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) of patients (pts) treated with E vs. C, \u0026 E vs E+C; each comparison had 91% power to detect a PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.5 with a 1-sided 0.10-level test stratified on prior number of therapies \u0026 ECOG PS.  Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), RECIST 1.1 response \u0026 CTCAE v4 toxicity. Pts were selected with previously treated (1-2 regimens) metastatic non-squamous EGFR wt NSCLC. Submission of archival tissue for central MET IHC testing was required. Oral daily dosing was: E-150 mg; C-60 mg; E+C-150 mg E, 40 mg C. Imaging was performed every 8 weeks. Pts optionally crossed over to E+C following progression on E or C.  Results:  One hundred and twenty-five pts were enrolled, of which 115 were eligible and treated (E, n \u003d 39; C, n \u003d 39; E+C, n \u003d 37). Pt characteristics were balanced between arms except for lower rate of brain mets history on E (p \u003d 0.02). Median follow up is 8.5 m. Compared with E (median 1.9 m), PFS was significantly improved on C (3.9 m, HR 0.33, p \u003d 0.0002, 80% CI 0.22-0.49) and E+C (4.1 m, HR 0.31, p \u003d 0.0002, 80% CI 0.21-0.46). Similarly, compared with E (median 4.0 m), OS was significantly improved on C (HR 0.52, p \u003d 0.02) and E+C arm HR 0.50, p \u003d 0.02). Grade 3-4 treatment-related hypertension \u0026 mucositis were higher on C and grade 3-4 diarrhea was higher on E+C. Overall worst grade toxicities were also significantly higher on C and E+C. MET IHC results were available on 88 patients from the primary analysis \u0026 85% were positive (1-3+ membrane or cytoplasm staining with MET4 antibody). There was no correlation between MET status and PFS.  Conclusions:   C \u0026 C+E significantly improved PFS over E alone in pts with EGFR wt NSCLC. Cabozantinib-based regimens are promising for further investigation in this patient population. Funded by ECOG-ACRIN and NCI Contract No. HHSN261200800001E.
