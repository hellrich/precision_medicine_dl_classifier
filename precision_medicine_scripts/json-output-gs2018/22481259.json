Histological diagnosis with all biopsy specimens were adenocarcinoma. Most of the metastatic sites were located in the middle or upper gastric corpus. Endoscopic features of the lesion showed a submucosal tumor-like (5 cases) and primary gastric cancer-like (3 cases) appearance. Immunohistochemical staining of cytokeratins, TTF-1, surfactant protein, ER, or MGB1 identified the primary site; 6 in the lung and 2 in the breast. One case was diagnosed based on the EGFR mutation analysis. In conclusion, immunohistochemical staining and molecular method are useful tools to distinguish metastatic gastric tumor from primary gastric cancer.","title":"[Clinicopathological features of 8 patients with metastatic gastric tumors].","pubmedId":"22481259"}
