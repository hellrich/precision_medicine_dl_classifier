However, the role of humoral responses in HSP-based autologous tumor immunotherapy remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether leukemia-specific antibodies and antibody-mediated cytotoxicity against autologous leukemia cells have a crucial role in a mouse A20 leukemia model by immunizing A20-derived HSP70. Immunization with A20-derived HSP70 induced the production of anti-A20-antibodies and the antibodies recognized HSP70-binding peptides derived from A20. One of those was a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I binding peptide, which has been clarified as the target peptide of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) against A20. The anti-A20-antibodies produced by immunization with A20-derived HSP70 induced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against A20 in vitro. In addition, immunization with A20-derived HSP70 increased intracellular interleukin-4 (IL4)-production of CD4(+) T-cells, confirming the activation of type-2 helper T-cells. Taken together, immunization with leukemia-cell-derived HSP70 induces antibodies against leukemia-cell-specific peptides and might play a crucial role in the eradication of leukemia cells by CDC in mice. These findings will enable future establishment of a novel therapeutic strategy using antileukemia antibodies in HSP-based autologous tumor immunotherapy.","title":"Induction of leukemia-specific antibodies by immunotherapy with leukemia-cell-derived heat shock protein 70.","pubmedId":"18452562"}
