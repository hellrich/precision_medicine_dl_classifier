The constitutive activation of NFE2L2 in lung cancer cells promotes tumorigenicity. However, the correlation between NFE2L2 mutation status and clinicopathologic features of lung cancer has not been well characterized.\nWe have investigated NFE2L2 gene mutation status in 263 surgically treated lung cancer cases at Nagoya City University Hospital. The NFE2L2 mutation was analyzed by direct sequencing of cDNA.\nWe detected 13 cases (5.1%) of NFE2L2 mutation in our cohort; all were male and all had a squamous histology. EGFR mutations were present in 78 patients (30.8%). The NFE2L2 mutation was exclusive with EGFR mutations. The NFE2L2 mutation tended to be more frequently found in patients with advanced stages. The patients with NFE2L2 mutation (n \u003d 13, 8 were dead) had significantly worse prognosis than the patient with wild type NFE2L2 (n \u003d 250, 72 were dead) (Log-rank test, p \u003d 0.0032, Breslow-Gehan-Wilcoxon test, p \u003d 0.0028).\nNFE2L2 mutations might play a role in tumor prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.","title":"NFE2L2 gene mutation in male Japanese squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"20421815"}
