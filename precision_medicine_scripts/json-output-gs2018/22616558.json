A meta-analysis was performed to demonstrate their controversial prognostic impacts. The associations of IDH1 or IDH2 mutations with other molecular abnormalities were also investigated. In patients with AML, IDH1/2 mutations were significantly associated with normal karyotype and isolated trisomy 8 (p \u003c .05). After adjusting for well-studied prognostic factors, IDH1 mutation seems to be associated with subtle but significantly inferior event-free survival (EFS) (p \u003d 0.02) and possible adverse overall survival (OS) (p \u003d 0.13) in patients with AML, especially in the favorable genotype subset with mutated NPM1 but without FLT3-ITD mutation (p \u003c 0.05). Longer OS (p \u003d 0.01) and better EFS tendency (p \u003d 0.18) are implicated in patients with IDH2 mutations, which suggests that IDH2 mutations appear to confer a favorable prognosis. Moreover, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may play a more important role in abnormal cytogenetics subgroups such as isolated trisomy 8. Screening of IDH1/2 mutations could help to identify patients at high risk within some subsets of AML.","title":"Potential application of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations as prognostic indicators in non-promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"22616558"}
