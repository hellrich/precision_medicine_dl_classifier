In order to detect the tissular expression of c-erbB2 protein, tissular samples from 10 patients with primary endometrial cancer were immmunohistochemically processed. C-erbB2 immunostaining using c-erbB2 (21N) antiserum marked the cellular membranes and, occasionally, the cytoplasma of the tumoral cells. The overexpression of c-erbB2 protein in the examed cases was correlated with the clinical status, histological type of the tumour and the differentiation degree. All the patients presented immunoreactivity of variable intensity for c-erbB2 protein. The alterations of c-erbB2 protein are considered to be an unfavourable prognostic factor implied in the tumoral progression.","title":"Prognostic significance of c-erbB2 protein in endometrial cancer.","pubmedId":"15678850"}
