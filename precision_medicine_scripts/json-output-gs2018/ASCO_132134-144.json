Objective: To determine trends in incidence of Melanoma, BCC and SCC among 1.7 million members of Maccabi Healthcare Services from 2006 to 2011.  Methods: Data on newly diagnosed Melanoma, SCC and BCC cases was collected from the MHS Cancer Registry and based on histology reports from the centralized pathology lab. Age-specific and overall age-adjusted European standardized rates were computed. Trends were estimated by calculating Average Annual Percentage Change(AAPC).  Results: During the six year study period, a total of 16,079 subjects were diagnosed with at least one BCC, 4,767 with SCC and 1,264 with invasive melanoma. Age-standardized incidence rates were 188, 58 and 17 per 100,000 person years for BCC, SCC and melanoma, respectively. All lesions were more common among males and primarily affected the elderly. BCC rates were stable throughout the study period(AAPC -0.7%, 95%CI -4.5% to 3.2%) while SCC incidence increased significantly(AAPC 15.5%, 95%CI: 2.6% to 30.0%). In contrast, melanoma rates showed a continuously decreased with a significant AAPC of -3.0%, 95%CI (-4.5 to -0.1).   Conclusions: Previously unreported, the incidence of KC in Israel is one of the highest in the world. The disparities in incidence trends between SCC, BCC and melanoma allude to their different etiologies.  These findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring, education and prevention programs in a growing high risk population.","title":"Incidence trends of keratinocytic skin cancers and melanoma in Israel 2006-2011.","pubmedId":"ASCO_132134-144"}
