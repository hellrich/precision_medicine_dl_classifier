Two approaches are of particular interest: immune checkpoint inhibition, which aims to counteract the physiologic mechanisms of immune tolerance co-opted by some tumors, and vaccine therapy, which enables enhanced exposure to tumor antigen. Immune checkpoint therapies include the monoclonal antibody blockade of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) with ipilimumab, as well as antibody blockade of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and the PD-1 ligand. These immune checkpoint therapies have been evaluated in both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with early evidence of activity. Vaccines include antigen specific therapies which induce specific antitumor immunity against relevant tumor-associated antigens. In lung cancer, these include the melanoma-associated antigen-A3 (MAGE-A3), membrane-associated glycoprotein (MUC-1), and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Whole tumor vaccines have also been evaluated in lung cancer and influence the patient\u0027s immune system to allow recognition of the tumor as foreign creating de novo immunity. This review summarizes the evidence to date for the efficacy and safety of immunotherapies in lung cancer. ","title":"Immunotherapy in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25806276"}
