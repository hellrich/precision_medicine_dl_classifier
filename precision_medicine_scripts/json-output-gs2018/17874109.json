Clinically, variation in color is perhaps the most important hallmark of primary cutaneous melanoma. The change in color to white, off-white, blue-white and gray-white is a sign of (spontaneous) regression in malignant melanoma. Histopathologically the process starts with a dense lichenoid infiltrate of lymphocytes, and ends with fibrosis and/or melanosis within a thickened papillary dermis. The dense infiltrate of lymphocytes permeates the thin melanoma and destroys the atypical melanocytes in the epidermis and the papillary dermis. A key concern is how to define regression in a reproducible way. Using the following definition, a statistically significant risk of metastases can be demonstrated in thin melanomas (\u003c1.0 mm) with extensive regression (\u003e50%): \"fibroplasia with an absence of epidermal and dermal involvement by melanoma cells, but allowing for (lentiginous) single-cell proliferation of atypical melanocytes along the dermo-epidermal junction\".","title":"[Regression in malignant melanoma.
