The prognosis of both IDH1m and IDH2m in AML remains unclear.\nThe prevalence and the prognostic impact of R132 IDH1 and R172 IDH2 mutations were evaluated in a cohort of 520 adults with AML homogeneously treated in the French Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) -9801 and -9802 trials.\nThe prevalence of IDH1m and IDH2m was 9.6% and 3.0%, respectively, mostly associated with normal cytogenetics (CN). In patients with CN-AML, IDH1m were associated with NPM1m (P \u003d .008), but exclusive of CEBPAm (P \u003d .03). In contrary, no other mutations were detected in IDH2m patients. In CN-AML patients, IDH1m were found in 19% of favorable genotype ([NPM1m or CEBPAm] without fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3] internal tandem duplication [ITD]) and were associated with a higher risk of relapse (RR) and a shorter overall survival (OS). Favorable genotype in CN-AML could thus be defined by the association of NPM1m or CEBPAm with neither FLT3-ITD nor IDH1m. In IDH2m CN-AML patients, we observed a higher risk of induction failure, a higher RR and a shorter OS. In multivariate analysis, age, WBC count, the four-gene favorable genotype and IDH2m were independently associated with a higher RR and a shorter OS.\nContrarily to what is reported in gliomas, IDH1m and IDH2m in AML are associated with a poor prognosis. Screening of IDH1m could help to identify high-risk patients within the subset of CN-AML with a favorable genotype.","title":"Prognostic impact of isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme isoforms 1 and 2 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia: a study by the Acute Leukemia French Association group.","pubmedId":"20625116"}
