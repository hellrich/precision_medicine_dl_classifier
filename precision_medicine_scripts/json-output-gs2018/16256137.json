To assess altered gene expression, we examined PTCs with and without tyrosine kinase receptor rearrangements by mRNA differential display (DD).\nSix of 13 PTCs examined harbored RET chimeras (3x RET/PTC1, 1x RET/PTC3) and/or NTRK1 chimeras (2x trk, 1x TRK-T3, 2 unknown TRK hybrids). The method of DD analysis was refined by a novel fragment-recovery technique using a high-performance fluorescence scanner.\nOf 500 up- or down-regulated mRNA transcripts, 19 selected fragments were recovered, cloned, sequenced, and identified. The accuracy and high degree of reproducibility of the method was demonstrated. Differential expression of gene products with potential association to cell proliferation or tumor progression was observed, such as 14-3-3beta and Rab27a. Moreover, several gene products with unknown functions were demonstrated in PTCs bearing RET or NTRK1 hybrids versus rearrangement-negative PTCs, including a homologue of the Ig kappa light chain constant region.\nCandidate transcripts with presumed tumorigenic potential in other solid tumors may prove to be relevant in the progression of PTCs, too. Most promising is the isolation of several differentially expressed, yet unknown, genes that may open new insights in the pathogenesis or progression of PTC.","title":"Identification of differentially expressed genes in papillary thyroid carcinomas with and without rearrangements of the tyrosine kinase receptors RET and/or NTRK1.","pubmedId":"16256137"}
