{"publicationTypes":["2010 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: There has been no epidemiological data of melanoma in China until now, even no large scale data in Asia. This study was performed to determine the characteristics and clinical outcome of patients with melanoma in China. Methods: Pts with melanoma came from 29 provinces of China since 2006 at Beijing cancer hospital were retrieved for this review. The medical records included age, gender, ulceration status, Breslow thickness, stage, primary site and histological type. Statistical analysis including survival and multivariate analysis of factors associated with survival were respectively performed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model by SPSS 11.0 software. Results: Of 522 cases could be evaluated. The male to female ratio was 1:0.89 and median age of diagnosis was 52 years (12-85 years). The incidence peak was from 45 to 55 years. There were 258 cases (49.4%) of acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), 118 (22.6%) of mucosal melanoma (MCM), 69 (13.2%) of nodular melanoma (NM), 20 (3.8%) of superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), and others were unclassifiable. The proportion of pts with stage I, II, III and IV disease were respectively 6.1%, 55.9%, 25.1%, 12.8%. Ulceration status of 357 cases of cutaneous melanoma were recorded, 65.5% (234 pts) of them had ulceration. The 5-year survival rate of 522 pts was 41.6%, median survival time was 4.0 years (95%CI, 3.433-4.567). The difference in survival between MCM (5-y sur: 26.8%) and ALM (5-y sur: 53.9%) was significant (p \u003d 0.003). Five-year survival rates of pts with and without ulceration were 43.3% and 70.4% (p \u003d 0.078). Five-year survival rates of patients with stage I, II, III and IV disease were 94.4%, 44.8%, 40.2% and 5.1% respectively. Multivariate analysis showed stage III (HR \u003d 9.682, p \u003d 0.025) and IV (HR \u003d 28.936, p \u003d 0.001) correlated with worst prognosis, while other factors had no statistical correlation with survival. Conclusions: ALM and MCM are the common types of melanoma in China. Stage is the independent prognostic factors associated with survival.","title":"Melanoma in China: A prognostic study of 522 cases.","pubmedId":"ASCO_51892-74"}
