Genetic aberrations leading to constitutive RET activation are well-established as oncogenic events. Activating point mutations of RET, for example, are present in ca. 70% of medullary thyroid carcinoma patients including all hereditary cases, while RET gene rearrangements resulting in production of activated RET fusion proteins occur in approximately 10% of sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas. More recently, recurring RET gene rearrangements have also been found in 1-2 % of lung adenocarcinomas and subsets of other solid tumors including colorectal and salivary gland carcinomas. Thus RET kinase represents an actionable therapeutic target in multiple clinical settings with high medical need. Consequently several small-molecule inhibitors targeting this kinase have been explored in clinical settings. A common feature of most advanced agents is their lack of selectivity and in particular their potent cross-reactivity against VEGFR2, an RTK whose inhibition is associated with serious, dose-limiting cardiovascular toxicity. Indeed, the high homology between the two kinases renders identification of ATP competitive compounds that selectively inhibit RET over VEGFR2 a highly challenging task. Here we describe the preclinical activity of NMS-E668, a potent and selective ATP-competitive RET inhibitor characterized by favorable activity, selectivity and ADME profiles. Biochemically, NMS-E668 has an excellent selectivity profile against a panel of \u003e50 kinases, notably including \u003e10-fold selectivity over VEGFR2. Selectivity of NMS-E668 for RET vs. VEGFR2 was confirmed in NIH-3T3 cells engineered to express activated forms of these kinases. NMS-E668 potently (IC50 circa 50 nM) and selectively inhibited proliferation of RET-dependent tumor cells, including TT medullary carcinoma cells harboring a RET C634W activating point mutation and LC2/ad lung carcinoma cells bearing the oncogenic fusion protein CCDC6-RET. NMS-E668 also potently inhibited IL3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing KIF5B-RET, the RET rearrangement that is most commonly found in lung adenocarcinomas. Cellular mechanism studies confirmed that NMS-E668 inhibits RET autophosphorylation and downstream signaling at doses consistent with antiproliferative activity. Tested in vivo against KIF5B-RET-driven Ba/F3 tumors, NMS-E668 displayed \u003e90% tumor growth inhibition accompanied by target modulation following oral administration at 10 and 20 mg/kg, with prolonged tumor regressions observed at the higher dose. Thus NMS-E668, a potent and VEGFR2-sparing RET inhibitor is an innovative and highly promising candidate for further development.","title":"NMS-E668, a potent and selective RET kinase inhibitor characterized by specificity towards VEGFR2 and high antitumor efficacy against RET-driven models.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-2082"}
