The hedgehog receptor Patched1 (PTCH1) has been identified as the gene mutated in NBCCS. We analyzed PTCH1 in two familial and three sporadic Japanese NBCCS cases, and identified five germline mutations in PTCH1. Two cases have a nonsense mutation (c.3058C\u003eT and c.2760C\u003eA), one a splice site mutation (c.584+2T\u003eG), one a 1 bp insertion (c.2712_2713insA) and one a 1 bp deletion (c.980Gdel). All mutations induce truncation of the PTCH1 protein or could induce nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The 11-year-old male patient with splice-site mutation (c.584+2T\u003eG) had medulloblastoma (MB) at the age of 1 year. This is the first NBCCS patient with molecularly defined MB in Japan.","title":"Novel PTCH1 mutations in Japanese Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome patients: two familial and three sporadic cases including the first Japanese patient with medulloblastoma.","pubmedId":"21368767"}
