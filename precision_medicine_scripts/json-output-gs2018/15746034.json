However, no mutations have been reported for colorectal carcinoma. We therefore analyzed EGFR mutations in colorectal adenocarcinomas by the combined use of laser microdissection and sequencing of genomic DNA.\nWe examined 11 representative colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines and 33 clinical samples of colorectal carcinoma. In the clinical cases, we carefully dissected only carcinoma cells from frozen sections by laser microdissection. After DNA extraction and PCR, we examined EGFR mutations by sequencing genomic DNA.\nNone of 11 colorectal carcinoma cell lines exhibited somatic mutations, but 4 of 33 clinical tumors (12%) exhibited mutations in the EGFR kinase domain. This may be the first report of somatic mutations in colorectal adenocarcinoma.\nOur findings suggest that a distinct minority of colorectal adenocarcinomas exhibit somatic mutations of EGFR, and these tumors may be susceptible to gefitinib treatment.","title":"Somatic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor in colorectal carcinoma.","pubmedId":"15746034"}
