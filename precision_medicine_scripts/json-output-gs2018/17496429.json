In the present study, to elucidate the pathophysiological significance of EGFR translocation, we investigated the expression not only of conventional EGFR but also its phosphorylated form (pEGFR), focusing on its cellular localization in esophageal cancer tissues.\nFifty-two specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) obtained by surgery were examined immunohistochemically for their EGFR and pEGFR immunostaining patterns. The relationships between clinicopathological parameters and EGFR or pEGFR immunostaining patterns were then analyzed.\nIn 37 (71.2%) of the 52 esophageal SCCs, EGFR immunoreactivity was clearly localized at the plasma membrane of the cancer cells, whereas pEGFR immunoreactivity was clearly localized in the nucleus in 19 (36.5%) cases. Nuclear expression of pEGFR significantly correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis, and moreover was associated with a poor outcome of esophageal SCC.\nNuclear translocalization of pEGFR is associated with an increase in the malignant potential of esophageal SCC and may affect prognosis in patients with esophageal SCC.","title":"Nuclear expression of phosphorylated EGFR is associated with poor prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17496429"}
