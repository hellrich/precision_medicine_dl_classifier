The clinical features of NSCLC patients harboring ROS1 fusion gene were not fully understood due to small-to-modest sample sizes of these association studies.\nWe systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from their inception to March 31, 2015. We analyzed the association between ROS1 fusion genes and four common clinical variables, i.e., gender, smoking status, pathological type and clinical stage.\nEighteen studies consisting of 9,898 NSCLC patients were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled results showed that significantly higher rate of ROS1 fusion gene was detected in female NSCLC patients (OR \u003d1.54, 95% CI: 1.02-2.34, P\u003d0.042), patients without a smoking history (OR \u003d3.27, 95% CI: 1.44-7.45, P\u003d0.005), patients with adenocarcinomas NSCLC (OR \u003d10.24, 95% CI: 5.13-20.40, P\u003c0.001), and patients with an advanced clinical stages III-IV (OR \u003d2.57, 95% CI: 1.78-3.71, P\u003c0.001). The pooled prevalence of ROS1 fusion gene was 2.4% (95% CI: 1.8-3.1%) in adenocarcinoma and a significantly lower (0.2%) in non-adenocarcinoma tumors.\nROS1 rearrangement was more prevalent in female patients, patients without a smoking history, patients with adenocarcinoma, and patients on more advanced stages (stages III to IV).","title":"Clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with ROS1 fusion gene in non-small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"26207220"}
