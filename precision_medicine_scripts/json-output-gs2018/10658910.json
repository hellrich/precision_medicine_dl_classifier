To better characterize the host immune response, we have classified TIL by their immunoreactivity against lymphoid markers in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte common antigen (LCA) and TIA-1 (a granule-associated protein of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells) were used to immunostain a series of benign nevi, nontumorigenic radial growth phase, and tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanomas and metastases. Among nine nevi, few LCA+ TIL were found, among which rare cells were positive for TIA-1 (mean, 2.0). Five nontumorigenic radial growth phase melanomas also had few total TIL and rare TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 3.4); the nontumorigenic radial growth phase component of seven tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanomas had higher numbers of TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 11). Twelve cases of tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanoma showed a variable but significantly greater number of both LCA+ TIL and TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 30.6). Nine cases of metastatic melanoma had a wide range of variation in LCA as well as in TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 46). Although the mean total number of TIA-1+ TIL increased from nontumorigenic radial growth phase to tumorigenic vertical growth phase to metastases, TIA-1+ as a percentage of TIL declined across these categories of tumor progression (42%, 31%, and 26%, respectively). Our results show that these attributes of TIA-1+ TIL, both increasing total number but decreasing percentage, appear to be a marker of tumor progression of malignant melanomas. In addition, there was significant variability in the number of TIA-1+ TIL among advanced melanomas, raising the possibility that an assessment of TIA-1+ TIL may prove a useful prognostic tool for the evaluation of primary melanomas.","title":"TIA-1 positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in nevi and melanomas.","pubmedId":"10658910"}
