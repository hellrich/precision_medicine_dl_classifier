The disease exhibits a dominant autosomal hereditary trait, with implication of the human homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity Patched (PTCH) gene. BCNS is diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiological criteria and can be confirmed by genetic study. The patient prognosis is very good, with normal life expectancy in most cases.\nThe present study reports two cases of BCNS with the presence of maxillo-mandibular keratocystic odontogenic tumors.\nOne case was diagnosed according to clinical criteria, while the other required genetic confirmation that revealed a germ line mutation in exon 17 (c.2868delC), not previously described in the databases, which was considered to be responsible for the disease.","title":"Basal cell nevus syndrome: clinical and genetic diagnosis.","pubmedId":"19795138"}
