We evaluated the relationship between BRAF((V600E)) and tumor, host, and environmental factors in PTCs from all geographical areas of Sicily. By PCR, BRAF((V600E)) was investigated in a series of 323 PTCs diagnosed in 2002-2005. The correlation between clinicopathological tumor, host, and environmental characteristics and the presence of BRAF((V600E)) were evaluated by both univariate and multivariate analyses. BRAF((V600E)) was found in 38.6% PTCs, with a 52% frequency in the classical PTCs and 26.4% in the tall cell variant. Univariate analysis indicated that BRAF((V600E)) was associated with greater tumor size (P\u003d0.0048), extra-thyroid invasion (P\u003c0.0001), and cervical lymph nodal metastases (P\u003d0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that BRAF((V600E)) was an independent predictor of extra-thyroid invasion (P\u003d0.0001) and cervical lymph nodal metastasis (P\u003d0.0005). The association between BRAF((V600E)) and extra-thyroid invasion was also found in micro-PTCs (P\u003d0.006). In 60 classical PTCs, BRAF((V600E)) was positively correlated with matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression (P\u003d0.0047), suggesting a possible mechanism for BRAF((V600E)) effect on PTC invasiveness. No association was found between BRAF((V600E)) and patient age, gender, or iodine intake. In contrast, a strong association was found with residency in Eastern Sicily (P\u003c0.0001 compared with Western Sicily). These results indicate that BRAF((V600E)) mutation is a marker of aggressive disease in both micro- and macro-PTCs. Moreover, for the first time, a possible link between BRAF((V600E)) mutation and environmental carcinogens is suggested.","title":"BRAF(V600E) mutation and the biology of papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"18310287"}
