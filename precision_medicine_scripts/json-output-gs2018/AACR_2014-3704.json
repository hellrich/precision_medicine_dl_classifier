BRAF is a component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and BRAF or MEK inhibitors increase progression-free and overall survival in melanoma patients with BRAF mutations. However, most patients relapse with acquired resistance and 20% of patients present intrinsic resistance and do not respond to these drugs. We describe here two novel compounds that target mutant BRAF and wild-type CRAF. Our compounds inhibited the growth of melanoma cells that were resistant to BRAF-selective inhibitors. ERK pathway reactivation is responsible for resistance to BRAF targeted therapies in 60% of the patients and in 25% of patients resistance is driven by acquisition of mutations in NRAS. We show that our compounds inhibited the growth of melanoma cells that were resistant to BRAF-selective inhibitors due to pathway reactivation mediated by different mechanisms. We show that the drugs were active against patient derived xenografts (PDXs) from patients with acquired or intrinsic resistance to BRAF-selective inhibitors and in whose tumors resistance was associated with ERK pathway reactivation. Further, our compounds are active in a PDX from a patient whose tumor developed acquired resistance to a combination of a BRAF-selective plus a MEK inhibitor and associated with acquisition of an NRAS mutation. Thus, our panRAF inhibitors can inhibit melanomas with different mechanisms of acquired or intrinsic resistance to BRAF-selective and BRAF-selective/MEK inhibitor combinations, potentially providing first-line treatment for nave patients and second-line treatments for a range of relapsed patients.","title":"Novel panRAF inhibitors active in melanomas that are resistant to BRAF-selective, or BRAF-selective/MEK inhibitor combinations","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3704"}
