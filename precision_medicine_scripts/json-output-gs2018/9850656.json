Fine needle aspiration findings reveal some points that have not been reported previously.\nA 50-year-old female presented with a left lobe thyroid mass. Fine needle aspiration of the nodule yielded cellular smears, mostly in large and small papillary clusters of Hürthle cells, with nuclear grooves and rare nuclear inclusions in a lymphoplasmacytic background. Isolated Hürthle cell and multinucleated giant cells were also seen. Histopathologic examination of the 3-cm-diameter nodule showed papillary Hürthle cell carcinoma with lymphocytic stroma, or \"Warthin-like tumor\" of the thyroid, with capsular invasion.\nThe presence of papillary clusters with nuclear features of papillary carcinoma and oxyphilic cytoplasm in a lymphoplasmacytic background should raise the diagnosis of Warthin-like tumor of the thyroid.","title":"Papillary Hürthle cell carcinoma (Warthin-like tumor) of the thyroid.
