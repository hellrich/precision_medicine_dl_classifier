The ErbB2-targeted antibody trastuzumab improves survival when given with chemotherapy to patients with ErbB2-overexpressing metastatic disease, but treatment is not curative, and primary resistance is common. Postulated mechanisms of action for trastuzumab include immune-mediated cytotoxicity and receptor downmodulation. A study in this issue of Cancer Cell suggests that trastuzumab causes rapid activation of the PTEN lipid phosphatase, which in turn downregulates the phosphatidylinositol 3\u0027-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Resistance to trastuzumab occurs when PTEN function is lost, suggesting that PTEN activation is a critical component of the therapeutic effect.","title":"Successful targeting of ErbB2 receptors-is PTEN the key?","pubmedId":"15324690"}
