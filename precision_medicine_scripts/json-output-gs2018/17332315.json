However, because CD4(+) T-helper (Th) cells also play a vital role in developing and maintaining tumor immunity, we investigated the presence of a CD4(+) Th response in ALK-positive ALCL. Using an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay, we identified two ALK-derived DRB1-restricted 24-mer promiscuous peptides, ALK1(278-301) and ALK2(233-256), as being immunogenic in six ALK-positive ALCL patients but not in two ALK-negative ALCL patients or five normal subjects. A significant interleukin-4 response to the ALK peptides was detected in only one ALK-positive patient. CD4(+) Th cell lines lysed ALK-positive ALCL cell lines in a MHC class II-restricted manner. This first report of a CD4(+) Th response to ALK provides valuable information for developing future immunotherapeutic options for ALK-positive ALCL patients who fail to respond well to conventional therapies.","title":"CD4 T-helper responses to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein in patients with ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"17332315"}
