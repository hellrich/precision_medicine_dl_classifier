State cancer registries contacted potential participants via mailed letters. Participants who gave their informed consent completed a written survey.\nCurrent body image dissatisfaction, mental and physical health, sexual functioning, and basic medical and demographic information.\nResults of multiple regression analysis indicated that male survivors of prostate cancer were more likely to express positive body images than men who had other types of cancer. A composite variable that included a history of cancer recurrence, multiple cancers, or metastatic cancer was the strongest predictor of body image dissatisfaction for female survivors. Body image was not associated with age, length of time since diagnosis, or general treatment type for either gender.\nBody image was associated with various medical and psychosocial factors, and the factors differed for male and female cancer survivors.\nAn understanding of factors associated with body image is essential for the nursing care of patients with cancer.","title":"Body image dissatisfaction in cancer survivors.","pubmedId":"17573320"}
