The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for cutaneous melanoma was recently revised to include these prognostic variables. Major changes in the staging include: (1) melanoma thickness and ulceration but not level of invasion will be used in the T category (except for T1 melanomas); (2) the number of metastatic lymph nodes rather than their gross dimensions and the delineation of clinically occult (ie, \"microscopic\") versus clinically apparent (ie, \"macroscopic\") nodal metastases will be used in the N category; (3) the site of distant metastases and the presence of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) will be used in the M category; (4) all patients with stage I, II, or III disease will be upstaged when a primary melanoma is ulcerated; (5) satellite metastases around a primary melanoma and in-transit metastases will be merged into a single staging entity that is grouped into stage III disease; and (6) distinct definitions for clinical and pathologic staging will take into account the new staging information gained from intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy.","title":"The revised American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for melanoma.","pubmedId":"12170439"}
