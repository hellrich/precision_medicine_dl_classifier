A melanoma was excised of her back and more than one hundred pigmented lesions, four of which presented histologic characteristics of dysplastic nevus were observed. Several relatives of her presented multiple nevi and a sister of her mother and a brother of the patient had been diagnosed of melanoma. It is well established that such kind of nevi are precursor for melanomas, particularly familial forms. The clinical identification of such lesions is very simple and facilitates the diagnosis and early treatment of melanoma.","title":"[Dysplastic nevus syndrome with familial melanoma (type D2)].","pubmedId":"2716387"}
