We report clinical and pathologic characteristics of breast cancer in a clinical cohort of high risk Chinese women with BRCA mutations and those without mutations. Methods: 202 high risk women based on their age and family history were recruited from March 2007 to November 2008. Medical information was prospectively collected from the patients and medical records. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were detected using full gene sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Results: Of the 202 female probands tested, 25 (12.3 %) were BRCA mutation carriers of which 11 (44%) were BRCA1 and 14 (56%) were BRCA2 mutations. Breast cancer risk factors, other than family history, did not differ between carriers and non-carriers. Mutation carriers were more likely to have a familial history of breast cancer (p\u003d0.07) and personal and family history of ovarian cancer (p\u003d0.005; p\u003d0.007). Other cancers found in carriers families included pancreatic, gastric, colon, lung, liver, and nasopharyngeal. 23% of women diagnosed with DCIS had BRCA mutations compared with 11.4% of those with invasive cancers. BRCA related tumors were more likely to be ER, PR and Her-2 negative (Triple negative, TN) (p\u003d 0.006). Overall 9.6% of non-BRCA cancers were TN whereas 25.9% of BRCA cancers were TN. Prevalence of TN in BRCA1 carriers is 71% compared with 13.4% in BRCA2 carriers. BRCA1 mutation related cancers were significantly more likely to be ER negative than BRCA2 and this is only significant in those who are under 40 years of age (p\u003d0.070). Conclusions: We have a high BRCA2 mutation rate in our cohort. BRCA related breast cancer is associated with families with increasing number of first degree relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancers and were higher for DCIS cancers. Prevalence of TN breast cancers was high compared to Caucasian cohorts. BRCA mutations were associated with pathologically, poor prognostic features (TN and high grade) especially in younger women.","title":"Clinical and pathological characteristics of Chinese patients with BRCA related breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_31953-65"}
