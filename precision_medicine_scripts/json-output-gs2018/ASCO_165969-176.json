However, only a fraction of patients selected for treatment by the RAS mutation status benefit. We previously showed that EGFR gene copy number (GCN), as analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)-guided in situ hybridization (ISH), predicts response to anti-EGFR therapy in KRAS exon 2 wild-type (wt) metastatic colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the predictive role of EGFR GCN in RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wt metastatic colorectal cancer. Methods: The patient material included 102 patients with KRAS exon 2 wt metastatic colorectal cancer treated with anti-EGFR antibodies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used for KRAS exons 2, 3 and 4, NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4, BRAF and PIK3CA gene mutation analyses from primary tumor tissue samples. EGFR GCN was analyzed by EGFR IHC guided automated silver ISH (GCN cutoff 4.0). Results:RAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA gene mutation analyses were successfully performed for 86.3% of the patients. Additional mutations in the RAS gene were found in 28.4% (25/88) of the KRAS exon 2 wt tumors. BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were observed in 22.7% and 15.9% of the cases, respectively. EGFR GCN was  4.0 in a majority of the RAS wt patients (40/63, 63.5%). An elevated EGFR GCN predicted a better response to anti-EGFR therapy and prolonged PFS in the RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wt patients. In addition, most RAS wt patients with an EGFR GCN  4.0 in their primary tumors benefited of anti-EGFR therapy in terms of clinical benefit (SD, PR or CR) (Chi-Square Test, p \u003d 0.0005), and had a longer progression free survival than those with a EGFR GCN below 4.0 (Log-Rank Test, p \u003c 0.0001). In contrast, the response RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wt, EGFR GCN below 4.0 patients did not differ from patients with mutant in RAS, or BRAF or PIK3CA. Conclusions: The study indicates that EGFR GCN serves as a predictive marker for anti-EGFR treatment efficacy in patients with RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wtmetastatic colorectal cancer. Tumors with EGFR GCN below 4.0 appear to be as refractory to anti-EGFR treatment as tumors with mutation in any of the RAS/RAF/PIK3CA pathway genes.","title":"EGFR gene copy number to predict response to anti-EGFR treatment and survival in RAS wild type and RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wild type metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_165969-176"}
