The incidence of mutations in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP) was 25.00%, 40.00% and 30.00%, respectively. For 6 of the 7 patients with mutations who were resistant to imatinib before sequencing, the daily drug dose had been increased to 600-800 mg daily for poor response to 400 mg/day imatinib. During the follow-up for 3-6 months, only the patient with F317L achieved major cytogenetic response (MCR), and the patient with Y253H and 1 of the 3 with T315I progressed to BP. The newly diagnosed patient with G321W IN cp achieved a complete hematologic remission and had a significant decrease of the proportion of BCR-ABL-positive cells.\nABL kinase point mutation is an important mechanism of imatinib resistance. The type of mutations is associated with the level of resistance to imatinib, and detection of ABL kinase point mutations by direct sequencing may help estimate the prognosis and plan for therapeutic strategy adjustment.","title":"[Detection of ABL kinase domain point mutations in chronic myeloid leukemia patients receiving imatinib treatment].","pubmedId":"18504184"}
