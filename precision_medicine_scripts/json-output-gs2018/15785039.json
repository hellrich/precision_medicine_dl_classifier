The effects on growth were examined by methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) assay. The c-Kit expression in human endocrine tumor tissue and cell lines was determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, respectively. Cytotoxicity assay was performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The telomerase activity was determined using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol.\n28% of the insulinomas, 100% of the gastrinomas, and 38% of the carcinoids expressed c-Kit. Imatinib at concentrations \u003e5 microM inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in both c-Kit-positive and c-Kit-negative cell lines. The PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin did not enhance the effects of imatinib. Imatinib did not sensitize endocrine tumor cells to doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil. Imatinib inhibited the telomerase activity.\nImatinib inhibits neuroendocrine tumor cell growth independently of c-Kit by inhibition of other tyrosine kinases or through tyrosine kinase independent pathways.","title":"Effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib on neuroendocrine tumor cell growth.","pubmedId":"15785039"}
