Here we report that in Hep3B cells, cotransfection of NF1/L, NF1/Red1, or NF1/X with the alpha1B adrenergic receptor (alpha1BAR) gene middle (P2) promoter increases P2 activity to more or less the same degree, whereas in DDT1 MF-2 cells cotransfection of NF1/L or NF1/Red1 causes a small but statistically significant decrease in the P2 promoter activity, and NF1/X causes a greater, 70% inhibition. Further experiments using truncated NF1/X mutants indicate that NF1/X contains both positive and negative regulatory domains. The positive domain, located between amino acids 416 and 505, is active in Hep3B cells, whereas the negative domain, located between amino acids 243 and 416, is active in DDT1 MF-2 cells. These functional domains are also capable of regulating transcription when isolated from their natural context and fused into the GAL4 binding domain. Furthermore, NF1 affinity purified from rat liver nuclear extracts copurified with a non-DNA binding protein, which can bind to the P2 promoter of the alpha1BAR gene via interacting with NF1. Taken together, these findings indicate that NF1/X contains both activation and suppression domains that may be recognized and modulated by cell type-specific cofactors. This may be one of the mechanisms whereby NF1 can activate or suppress the expression of different genes, and it may also underlie the tissue-specific regulation of the alpha1B AR gene.","title":"Cell type-specific transcriptional activation and suppression of the alpha1B adrenergic receptor gene middle promoter by nuclear factor 1.","pubmedId":"9822643"}
