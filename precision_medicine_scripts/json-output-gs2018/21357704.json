Seven (8%) of 92 patients carrying mutations had more than one mutation: 4 (4%) in chronic phase, 2 (2%) in accelerated phase, and one (1 %) in blast phase. The cytogenetic response rate to second generation TKIs for patients with no, one, or more than one mutation was 88%, 69%, 50% (P\u003d0.03) in chronic phase, 54%, 42%, 50% in accelerated phase (P\u003d0.67), and 35%, 25%, 0% (P\u003d0.63) in blast phase, respectively. No differences were observed in event free survival or overall survival in accelerated or blast phase according to their mutational status. However, the 4-year event free survival rates among patients in chronic phase with no, one, or more than one BCR-ABL1 mutation were 56%, 49%, and 0%, respectively (P\u003d0.02), with overall survival rates of 91%, 69%, and 75%, respectively (P\u003d0.13). In conclusion, patients with more than one BCR-ABL1 mutation fare worse than those with no or one mutation.","title":"Outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia with multiple ABL1 kinase domain mutations receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.","pubmedId":"21357704"}
