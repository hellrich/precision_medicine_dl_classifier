However, no data are available on the expression of this protein in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). The objective of this preliminary study is to investigate the expression of ANXA2 in these carcinomas.\nANXA2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded sections from 9 patients with premalignant lesions and 21 patients with HNSCC.\nAll dysplastic tissues showed significantly reduced ANXA2 expression compared to normal tissue. In contrast, ANXA2 expression was observed in all but one of the tumours studied. There was a significant correlation of lower ANXA2 expression with a poorer histological differentiation, larger tumours, and nodal metastases.\nOur data show for the first time that ANXA2 is expressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and that its expression seems to be related with the degree of differentiation status of these tumours.","title":"[Annexin A2 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma].","pubmedId":"17663946"}
