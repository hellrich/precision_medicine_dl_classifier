We examined IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R140/R172 mutations by high resolution melting analysis and direct sequencing in Chinese patients with different myeloid malignancies including 198 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 82 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 85 chronic myeloid leukemia, and 57 myeloproliferative neoplasms. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were found in four (2.0%) and ten (5.0%) AML and in two (2.4%) and three (3.6%) MDS cases, but not in other patients. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were heterozygous and mutually exclusive. IDH1/2 mutations were significantly more frequently observed in cytogenetically normal AML or MDS compared to those without mutations. There was no difference in overall survival of both AML and MDS patients with or without IDH1/2 mutations (P \u003d 0.177 and 0.407, respectively). In conclusion, IDH1/2 mutations are recurrent but rare molecular aberrations in Chinese AML and MDS.","title":"IDH1 and IDH2 mutation analysis in Chinese patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.","pubmedId":"21997850"}
