More recently, gene expression profiling has provided a highly accurate and biologically informative gold standard for molecular prognostication. The latest step in the evolution of molecular testing has been the recent discovery of major driver mutations that allow predictive testing of response to targeted molecular therapies. Mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 are early events that promote cell proliferation, and these mutations are sensitive to MAPK kinase, PKC, and AKT inhibitors. Mutations in BAP1, SF3B1, and EIF1AX are later events that are largely mutually exclusive. Mutations in BAP1 are strongly associated with metastasis, whereas those in SF3B1 and EIF1AX are associated with good prognosis. Uveal melanomas with BAP1 mutations demonstrate sensitivity to epigenetic modulators, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors. Clinical trials are now available to evaluate the efficacy of these targeted molecular agents in patients with uveal melanoma.\nMolecular prognostic testing and enrollment of high-risk patients into clinical trials of targeted molecular therapy are rapidly becoming the standard of care in the management of uveal melanoma.","title":"Recent developments in prognostic and predictive testing in uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"24713608"}
