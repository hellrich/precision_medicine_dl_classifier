Cystic adenoid carcinoma (or cylindroma) represents the second most frequent type of tracheal cancers. Histologically speaking, this tumor type is divided in three patterns: cribriform, tubular and solid; it presents a slow growth, perineural invasion and potential local recurrence and metastasis. We presented herein the case of a 56-year-old female suffering from a cystic adenoid carcinoma of the low trachea. She has been treated by carinal resection with negative airway margin and complete reconstruction, with the help of an extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).","title":"[Tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma treated by complete carinal reconstruction with the help of an ECMO: about a case].","pubmedId":"23597633"}
