The antigen expression intensity was calculated as relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) and for direct quantitative analysis the QuantiBRITE test (Becton Dickinson) was applied. Antibody bounding capacity (ABC) was calculated using QuantiCALC software. CD117 antigen was present in 49/158 MM, 5/12 PCL and 5/7 MGUS patients. The RFI values ranged from 0.2 to 20.2 in particular MM patients (mean: 11.0+/-5.3; median 11.5) while the number of CD117 binding sites (ABC) on MM plasma cells ranged from 637 to 6217 (mean: 3029+/-1568; median 2946) (r\u003d0.8328). In responsive to chemotherapy c-kit positive MM patients the percentage of CD117+ plasma cells in the bone marrow decreased significantly while in c-kit negative MM patients the percentage of CD117+ cells in bone marrow did not change and remained in the normal limits. When comparing the clinical and biological disease characteristics (monoclonal protein isotype, albumin, beta2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase, stage of disease, response to chemotherapy, survival time) of c-kit positive and c-kit negative cases, no significant differences were found. In CD117 positive PCL cases expression of CD117 was detected in bone marrow plasma cells as well as in peripheral blood plasma cells. Normal plasma cells and those in IgM lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma did not show reactivity for the CD117 antigen. We conclude that it may be rationale to consider usefulness of therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the management of c-kit positive plasma cell proliferations. In one third of MM and PCL patients c-kit antigen could be considered as a \"tumor associated marker\" and together with CD38 and CD138 it may be of value for the identification of the malignant clone in minimal residual disease as it was first suggested by Spanish authors.","title":"C-kit receptor (CD117) expression on plasma cells in monoclonal gammopathies.","pubmedId":"15512818"}
