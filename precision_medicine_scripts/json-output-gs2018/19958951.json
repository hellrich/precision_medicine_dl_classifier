It is not known whether pre-operative identification of BRAF mutations in cytologic specimens should alter surgical management.\nFrom 2006 to 2008, the clinical, cytologic, and pathologic parameters of 106 consecutive surgically treated patients with BRAF-positive PTC were compared with a concurrent cohort of 100 patients with BRAF-negative PTC.\nIn all, 99 BRAF-positive PTC patients underwent initial treatment, and 7 BRAF-positive patients had surgical resection of recurrent/persistent PTC. BRAF mutations were identified on preoperative cytologic samples (31 patients) or after thyroidectomy (75 patients). All 31 patients with BRAF-positive fine-needle aspiration (FNA) had PTC at thyroidectomy (specificity 100%). At short-term follow-up, 11/106 BRAF-positive patients have required reoperation for recurrent/persistent disease compared with 3 BRAF-negative patients (P \u003d .04). Preoperative knowledge of BRAF mutation positivity could have productively altered initial PTC surgical management in 24% of patients.\nIn PTC, BRAF mutations are associated with cervical recurrence and with reoperation. Pre-operative cytologic identification of BRAF mutation has high specificity and may guide the initial extent of thyroidectomy and node dissection.","title":"Optimizing surgical treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma associated with BRAF mutation.","pubmedId":"19958951"}
