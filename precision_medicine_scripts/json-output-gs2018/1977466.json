Amplification occurred in 22.5% of the primary tumours and 50% of the metastases. The amplification was negatively correlated to the oestrogen receptor (ER) content in both the primary tumours and the metastases. No significant differences between amplified and non-amplified tumours were observed with regard to node status, clinical stage, tumour size or menopausal status, although correlations of borderline significance were found between node status, clinical stage and high degree of gene amplification. All the amplified tumours were of the invasive ductal type. Follow-up data of patients observed for more than 1 year showed a significantly higher recurrence rate in the c-erbB-2 amplified group. Allele loss of chromosome 17p and of 7q was seen in 55% and 48% of the tumours respectively. No significant correlation was found between these losses and clinico-histological parameters. More than 50% of the tumours with a loss of 17q sequences had an amplification of c-erbB-2 which is located on 17q12-21, indicating that only one of the chromosomes may be involved in the amplification of the c-erbB-2. A trend towards a correlation between loss of 17q and high degree of amplification were found. No correlation was found between positive family history of breast cancer and c-erbB-2 gene amplification, nor loss of 17p or 17q sequences. Our data support the hypothesis that amplification correlates with aggressive tumour behaviour, and thus may be used as a prognostic factor in breast carcinomas. The allele losses on 17p and 17q points to tumour suppressor gene or genes on this chromosome, although not as predisposing genes in families.","title":"Amplification and protein over-expression of the neu/HER-2/c-erbB-2 protooncogene in human breast carcinomas: relationship to loss of gene sequences on chromosome 17, family history and prognosis.","pubmedId":"1977466"}
