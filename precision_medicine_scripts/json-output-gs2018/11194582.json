Worldwide, less than 200 cases have been reported to date. We report here a 72 year-old Saudi male who presented with abdominal pain and anorexia. On endoscopy a dark lesion was found in the oesophagus. Its histopathological features were consistent with malignant melanoma. There were no other melanotic lesions elsewhere. PMME occurs most frequently in the 7th and 8th decades of life with a male predominance. It is an aggressive tumour with the majority of patients dying in less than 2 years due to metastases to vital organs. Surgery is the treatment of choice. However, radiation may be useful as adjuvant therapy.","title":"Primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus: case report and review.","pubmedId":"11194582"}
