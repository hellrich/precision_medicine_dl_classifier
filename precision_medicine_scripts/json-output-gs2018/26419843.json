All patients had microscopically tumor positive SLN. Hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E) staining was performed, followed by PD-L1 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining using a preliminary IHC assay with anti-PD-L1 antibody clone 22C3. The slides were separately evaluated by two pathologists (JY and CG). Samples containing metastatic melanoma lesions were scored separately for PD-L1 expression in intratumoral and peritumoral locations, by utilizing two scoring methods.\nTwenty-four patients where metastatic melanoma presence in the SLN was confirmed by H\u0026E review of the cut sections were included in the final analysis of PD-L1 expression. SLN tumor size ranged from 1 to 2 mm. For three patients, the melanin content was too high to confidently assign a PD-L1 score. For the remaining 21 patients, all had some evidence of either intratumoral or peritumoral PD-L1 expression. The frequency of intratumoral tumor-associated PD-L1 expression was: 0 % of tumor cells (3 pts, 14 %); \u003c1 % (5 pts, 24 %); 1-10 % (6 pts, 29 %) and \u003e10 % (7 pts, 33 %).\nTumor-associated PD-L1 expression is readily detectable within melanoma micrometastases in the SLN of the majority of patients. These results support the testing of a therapeutic role for PD1/PD-L1 inhibition in the adjuvant setting, targeting melanoma micrometastases.","title":"Tumor associated PD-L1 expression pattern in microscopically tumor positive sentinel lymph nodes in patients with melanoma.","pubmedId":"26419843"}
