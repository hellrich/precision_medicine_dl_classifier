Genomic DNA was extracted and the BRAF mutation detected by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and direct sequencing analysis. Total protein was obtained and the activated ERK detected by Western blot.\nBRAF mutation was detected in 5% (1/20) samples of all patients. The mutation rate was much lower than that in cutaneous melanomas. And phosphorylated ERK protein was detected in 60% (12/20). And the result was almost similar to that of cutaneous melanomas.\nThe high expression of activated ERK is not caused mainly by BRAF gene mutation in nasal mucosa malignant melanomas. The pathogenic pathways are different between nasal mucosa malignant melanomas and cutaneous melanomas.","title":"[Analysis of BRAF mutation and extracellular regulated protein kinases activation in nasal mucosa melanomas].","pubmedId":"21223812"}
