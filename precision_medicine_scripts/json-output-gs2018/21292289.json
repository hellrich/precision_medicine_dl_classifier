Its complications are very rare.\nA panoramic x-ray was made to complete the pre-radiotherapy oral assessment of a 71-year-old female patient presenting with lung adenocarcinoma. This revealed a periapical fibro-osseous lesion on tooth n° 46. She had presented with a similar lesion on tooth n° 36, 16 years before. This had been treated by extraction and alveolar curettage. No surgical treatment was suggested for this recurrence on tooth n° 46.\nThe diagnosis of focal cemento-osseous dysplasia is usually made on radiological and clinical data. The risk for transition to a florid form is unknown. Exeresis surgery before radiotherapy is discussed.","title":"[Long-term follow-up of cemento-osseous dysplasia: a contralateral recurrence before radiotherapy].","pubmedId":"21292289"}
