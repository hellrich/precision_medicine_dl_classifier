Associations between p16 expression and clinicopathological features were investigated.\nDecreased p16 expression was found in 48% of the tumours. There was a higher frequency of decreased p16 expression in tumours of the larynx compared with those from the pharynx and oral cavity. There was a significant correlation between decreased p16 expression and more advanced T stage. There was no significant correlation between p16 expression and sex, age, tumour grade, nodal metastasis, recurrence, or survival.\nThere was a high frequency of downregulation of p16 expression in HNSCC. Tumours of the larynx had a significantly higher frequency of weak p16 expression compared with tumours of the oral cavity and pharynx. Downregulation of p16 contributed to cellular proliferation, resulting locally in a more advanced tumour. It had no prognostic significance for nodal metastasis and survival.","title":"Clinicopathological significance of p16 gene expression in the surgical treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.","pubmedId":"11825926"}
