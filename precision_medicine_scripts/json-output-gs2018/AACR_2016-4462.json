The majority of UM harbor activating mutations in the G proteins Gnaq/11, and amplification of the oncogene c-Myc. Currently available drugs have shown limited response in patients with UM and there is an urgent need for new effective therapies. Recent findings from our laboratory demonstrated that UM cells with Gnaq/11 mutations are dependent on BRD4 activity. BET proteins are epigenetic readers involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4 inhibitors consist of small molecules that competitively displace BRD4 from acetylated histones, resulting in the suppression of the MYC transcriptome and other BRD4-dependent genes. Here, we report that a novel clinical BRD4 inhibitor from Plexxikon (Berkeley, CA), PLX51107, induces high cytotoxic activity in UM cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. In cells with Gnaq/11 mutations, PLX51107 showed an IC50 of 250nM, similar to the pre-clinical compound JQ1. In contrast, PLX51107 did not have a significant effect (IC50\u003e3000nM) in cells without the mutations. PLX51107 induced marked apoptosis in Gnaq/11 mutant cells, as detected by Annexin V staining and induction of cleaved PARP. It also suppressed the expression of BRD4 targets, i.e c-Myc, Rad51, and induced the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. In mouse xenograft models of UM PLX51107 significantly inhibited tumor growth. Since the MAPK pathway plays a major role in UM, we explored the combination of PLX51107 with a MEK inhibitor, and found increased activity in vitro and in vivo. All together, these observations support the idea that this clinical BRD4 inhibitor represents a novel therapeutic intervention against UM with Gnaq/11 mutations, and clinical development is planned.","title":"Cytotoxic effects of a novel BRD4 inhibitor in uveal melanoma cells with Gnaq/11 mutations","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4462"}
