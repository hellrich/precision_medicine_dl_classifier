They almost exclusively derive from B cells of mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue and only a very small minority of them is represented by T cell lymphomas. CD30 molecule, other than in Hodgkin\u0027s and Redd-Sternberg\u0027 cells, is strictly associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma and ALK lymphomas, the latter being identified by the monoclonal antibody ALK1. We report a case of CD30-positive non-anaplastic (ALK1-negative) peripheral T cell lymphoma of the thyroid gland and speculate on aspects concerning diagnosis and the morphologic and immunohistochemical findings.","title":"CD30 positive (non-anaplastic) peripheral T-cell lymphoma of the thyroid gland.","pubmedId":"10509044"}
