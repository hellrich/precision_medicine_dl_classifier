In absence of quality difference between studies of reporting significant and nonsignificant results, the relationship between FGFR1 amplification and clinicopathological parameters in NSCLC was analyzed. And also the combined hazard ratio (HR) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated in terms of overall survival.\n3178 patients (12 studies) were included in the analysis. It was shown that FGFR1 amplification was significantly more prevalent among male patients (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.57-2.63) with squamous cell lung cancer (SQCC) (RR 3.49, 95% CI 2.62-4.64) and current smokers (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.92-3.60). The pooled data also showed that the FGFR1 amplification was a poor prognostic factor in SQCC (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.07-1.78), Asian patients (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.22-2.60), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06-1.58).\nThis meta-analysis strongly suggests that FGFR1 amplification occurs more frequently in male, SQCC and smokers, and it is a risk factor for poor prognosis among Asian patients with SQCC.","title":"The Role of FGFR1 Gene Amplification as a Poor Prognostic Factor in Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Published Data.","pubmedId":"26788508"}
