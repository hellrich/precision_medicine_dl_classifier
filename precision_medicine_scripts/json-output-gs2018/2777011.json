The latter allows better ECG and blood pressure recordings during exercise. Recently, a greater frequency of ST-segment depression has been reported with supine vs upright exercise, but some doubt as to the ischemic significance of this result has been raised. Thus, we compare the ECG and hemodynamic pattern during upright and supine bicycle exercise in 50 subjects with chest pain, without prior myocardial infarction: 31 had documented coronary artery disease (CAD) and 19 had normal coronary vessels. In a subgroup (22 CAD patients and all subjects without CAD) a measurement of myocardial perfusion was performed during exercise using thallium-201 radionuclide ventriculography. Initial work-load and the further graded increases were identical for both postures. The frequency of ST-segment depression was higher during supine exercise (84% vs 74%). The increase in sensitivity (+7% vs CAD) was wider if a more direct measurement of myocardial ischemia was adopted as gold standard (+13% vs TI-201 responses) and was not associated with a decreased specificity (Tab. II). In the supine position the threshold of exercise-induced ST-segment depression was significantly lower. Chest pain appeared more frequently and at a lower work-load. Accentuation and precocity of exercise-induced ischemia in the supine-position could be attributed to an increased imbalance between supply and demand of MVO2 at equivalent work-load, heart rate changes, systolic blood pressure and double product were significantly higher.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"[Potentiating effect of a supine position on ischemia induced by exercise].","pubmedId":"2777011"}
