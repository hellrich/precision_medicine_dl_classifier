The sensitive cells (n \u003d 8) included not only 4 of 4 MET-amplified cell lines but also 2 of 11 KRAS-mutated cell lines and 1 of 6 EGFR-mutated cell lines. Unlike the MET-amplified cell lines, both the MET-mutated cell lines were PHA665752 resistant. High phospho-MET was not restricted to the four MET-amplified cell lines. To the contrary, it was also found in 9 of 37 MET-nonamplified cell lines, including 3 of 6 EGFR-mutated cell lines and 4 of 11 KRAS-mutated cell lines. High phospho-MET was correlated with PHA665752 sensitivity in the entire panel of cell lines, especially in the KRAS-mutated cells. The AKT and ERK pathways in the high phospho-MET cell lines were dependent on MET activation in MET-amplified and KRAS-mutated cells but not in EGFR-mutated and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-amplified cells.\nMET amplification is an excellent predictor of PHA665752 sensitivity but not the sole predictor. High phospho-MET and dependence of the AKT and ERK pathways on MET activation may predict sensitivity to PHA665752, especially in KRAS-mutated cell lines.","title":"Molecular predictors of sensitivity to the MET inhibitor PHA665752 in lung carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"20736805"}
