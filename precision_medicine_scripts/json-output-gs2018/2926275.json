The most common site of metastatic involvement in squamous carcinoma of the head and neck is the lung followed by liver, mediastinal nodes and bone. The breast is rarely infiltrated by metastatic disease, 2 per cent or less of clinically detected breast lumps being of non-mammary origin, most frequently malignant melanoma, lymphoma/leukaemia and primary lung carcinoma. A 73-year-old female presented with a primary posterior pharyngeal wall squamous carcinoma and bilateral enlarged neck nodes. She developed an isolated breast metastasis while receiving palliative radiotherapy and died seven months after presentation. Clinically detected breast metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was first documented by Toombs and Kalisher in 1977. This is the first report of such a case originating in the posterior pharyngeal wall. The prognosis is invariably poor.","title":"Breast metastasis from a pharyngeal carcinoma.","pubmedId":"2926275"}
