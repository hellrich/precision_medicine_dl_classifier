We have developed a quantitative immunohistochemical method for measuring protein levels of both receptors and have applied this to a series of 123 breast primaries. We find EGFR expression is substantially lower than normal in nearly all breast cancers (97%). Quantification of p185erbB-2 indicates overexpression in 91% of the tumors. Two separate tumor populations are apparent with levels of c-erbB-2 expression ranging from 0.33 to 19 and 45 to 480 times normal, respectively. Within the lower population, p185erbB-2 expression is inversely related to EGFR expression (rank correlation, P \u003c 0.0005). Using fluorescent in situ hybridization we show that tumors in the latter population have c-erbB-2 amplification and that amplification is restricted to this group. Our findings indicate that significant overexpression of p185erbB-2 occurs in the absence of amplification; these lower levels of expression may have functional significance. Fifty-three patients underwent in vivo bromodeoxyuridine labeling, allowing flow cytometric analysis of tumor cell cycle kinetics. EGFR expression correlates directly to the labeling index (P \u003d 0.011) and indirectly to potential doubling time (P \u003d 0.010), but not to the duration of the S-phase (P \u003d 0.502). Conversely, p185erbB-2 expression does not relate to indices of proliferation. Our results have important implications for the use of both receptor types as therapeutic targets.","title":"Quantitative estimation of epidermal growth factor receptor and c-erbB-2 in human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"8706030"}
