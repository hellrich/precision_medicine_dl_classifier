Therefore, c-MET is a new molecular target for the therapy of NSCLC since EGFR and ALK. At present, although the c-MET inhibitors have shown a potential prospect in some clinical trials, its assessment of safety and effectiveness in clinical applications, and the choice of testing methods and standards still need a further discussion. In this paper, we summarized the mechanism of c-MET in NSCLC, as well as its treatment prospect and selection of testing methods. \n肝细胞生长因子/c-MET（hepatocyte growth factor/c-MET, HGF/c-MET）信号通路可通过多种机制如c-MET突变、扩增、过表达和HGF过表达被异常激活，并在非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）的发生发展以及表皮生长因子受体抑制剂（epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, EGFR-TKI）的耐药性方面发挥重要作用。因此，c-MET是继EGFR、ALK之后NSCLC的又一分子治疗靶点。目前c-MET抑制剂在一些临床试验中表现出了良好的的应用前景，但其在临床应用中的有效性和安全性的评估，以及对于c-MET检测方法的选择及判定标准还需进一步讨论。本文就c-MET在NSCLC中的作用机制、治疗前景和检测方法的选择作一综述。.","title":"[Mechanism of c-MET in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Its Treatment and Testing].","pubmedId":"26706951"}
