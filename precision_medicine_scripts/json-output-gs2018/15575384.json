Eight cases of p80+ and nine cases of p80-ALCL were studied. HL was represented by 13 cases with lymphoid depletion by a reticular type and 9 cases with nodular sclerosis with a syncytial growth. Ag-NOR-proteins were identified using histochemical method with silver nitrate. The expression of Ag-NOR-proteins in tumor cells of ALCL and HL appeared intensive, being highest in ALCL cells, in p80+ cells of ALCL there was superexpression. The differences in expression of Ag-NOR-proteins point to different proliferative activity and growth of the above variants of ALCL and HL. The test for Ag-NOR-proteins expression can be recommended as an additional tool in differential diagnosis, determination of malignancy grade, assesssment of prognosis and sensitivity to chemotherapy.","title":"[Argyrophilic proteins of nucleolar organizers regions as markers of malignancy grade of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma].","pubmedId":"15575384"}
