This study examined the status of TERT promoter mutation in distant metastatic DTC (DM-DTC), and evaluated the correlation between TERT mutation and radioactive iodine-131(RAI) uptake, as well as that between TERT mutation and therapy response.\nTERT promoter and B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) V600E mutation were retrospectively examined in primary tumors of 66 DM-DTC patients. Stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) changes, RAI uptake status (avid or non-avid), and other imaging evidence were analyzed to evaluate therapy response. After a median follow-up of 46.5 months (interquartile range, 29.0 to 70.5 months), therapy response was classified as disease control and refractory.\nThe prevalence of TERT mutations was 22.73% (15/66), of which C228T mutation was more prevalent (13/15) than C250T mutation (2/15). Rising sTg was noticed in 93.33% (14/15) of TERT mutation group. While in cases with both mutations negative, 78.12 % (25/32) presented with decreased sTg. TERT mutation closely correlated with poor RAI therapy response (p＜0.001), and all 15 patients were classified as refractory to RAI with a positive predictive value of 100% at the end point of follow-up. TERT mutation was associated with older mean age at diagnosis (p＜0.001), larger mean tumor diameter (P \u003d 0.013), and more likelihood of both BRAF mutation coexistence (P \u003d 0.044) and refractory to RAI (p＜0.001). In the 36 cases received imaging semi-quantitative analysis, it was found that TERT mutation significantly correlated with non-RAI-avidity, with a much lower mean tumor/background (T/B) ratio (obtained from post RAI therapy whole-body scanning) than TERT wild-type (p＜0.001). And DM-DTC patients with TERT mutation were more likely to lose RAI-avidity at initial RAI therapy than those with only BRAF mutation (8/8 vs 5/11, Fisher\u0027s exact test, P \u003d 0.018).\nTERT promoter mutation closely associates with non-RAI-avidity in DM-DTC, and when comparing with BRAF mutation, TERT mutation manifested a worse negative influence on RAI uptake. It could also be used as a predictive marker to early identify refractory to RAI.","title":"TERT promoter mutation predicts radioiodine refractory in distant metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"27493271"}
