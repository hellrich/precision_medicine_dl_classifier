Four of them were nonmelanoma skin cancers (2 basal-cell carcinomas and 2 squamous-cell carcinomas), the remaining two were noncutaneous malignancies (invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast and squamous cell carcinoma of the parotid gland). Three lesions were present simultaneously on the head and neck region; basal-cell carcinoma on the cheek, squamous-cell carcinomas on the forehead, and in the parotid gland. All neoplasms were surgically removed, the region of affected parotid gland was additionally radiated. Extreme rarity of the multifocal primary malignancies is emphasized and the non-completely clear etiology, biology and pathology of these tumors is discussed.","title":"[Multiple primary neoplasms on the face].","pubmedId":"12053675"}
