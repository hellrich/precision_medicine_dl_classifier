{"organisms":["9606","9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":" Myxofibrosarcoma is one of the most common sarcomas in elderly patients showing a slight male prevalence. The tumor is mainly located in lower and upper extremities and rarely in trunk, neck and feet. We present a case of a 84-year-old man referred to our tumour center with a giant and neglected high-grade tibial myxofibrosarcoma in the anteromedial side of tibial mid-diaphysis. Large size lesions in association with older age may jeopardise the maintenance of limb vitality, vascularity and stability.Authors performed a complete tumour resection, followed by reconstruction of bone and soft tissue defects with cement, plate and a musculocutaneous gastrocnemius flap, in order to cover the underlying bone and promote uneventful healing and perfusion of the operated extremity.At 2 years postoperatively, limb salvage, good functional outcome and no tumour recurrence were reported while the patient was able to effectively perform the majority of the daily activities.","title":"Surgical treatment of a giant tibial high-grade mixofibrosarcoma with preservation of limb function: a case report.","pubmedId":"19761609"}
