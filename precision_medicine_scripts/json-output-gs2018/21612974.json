Nine hundred and eighty-three patients diagnosed from 1990 to 2005 were identified from three nation-wide registries. The associated clinical data were retrospectively retrieved from patient medical records. Histological revision was performed in 886 cases (90%). Based on histological revision, 31 patients (3%) were excluded from the study leaving 952 for epidemiological analysis. The mean crude incidence in Denmark was 1.1/100,000/year. The male vs. female ratio was 0.97 and the median age was 62 years. The parotid gland was the most common site (52.5%) followed by the minor salivary glands of the oral cavity (26.3%). The most frequent histological subtypes were adenoid cystic carcinoma (25.2%), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (16.9%), adenocarcinoma NOS (12.2%) and acinic cell carcinoma (10.2%). The revision process changed the histological diagnosis in 121 out of 886 cases (14%). The incidence of salivary gland carcinoma in Denmark is higher than previously reported. More than half of salivary gland carcinomas are located in the parotid gland with adenoid cystic carcinoma being the most frequent subtype. Histological classification of salivary gland carcinomas is difficult and evaluation by dedicated pathology specialists might be essential for optimal diagnosis and treatment.","title":"Salivary gland carcinoma in Denmark 1990-2005: a national study of incidence, site and histology.
