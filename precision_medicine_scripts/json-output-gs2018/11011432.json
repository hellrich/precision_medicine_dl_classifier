An early diagnosis may benefit of radical surgery and adjuvant immunotherapy with curative effect. We present a sixty-five years old female with a malignant melanoma of urethra and a secondary additional melanoma in vulva, that was treated with both radical ureterectomy and vulvectomy. A bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy and immunotherapy with alpha-interferon were added. The patient is free of disease one year postoperatively.","title":"[Primary malignant melanoma of the female urethra. Report of a case].","pubmedId":"11011432"}
