They are described to be associated with a poor prognosis, when compared to gynecogical carcinoma. Aim of this study was to report incidence patterns and survival rates for gynecological sarcoma in Germany. Methods: Clinical data and survival rates for patients with gynecological sarcoma diagnosed in Germany between 2009 and 2013 were extracted from the German national centre for population-based cancer registry data. Incidence patterns and 5-year-relative survival rates were calculated. Results: A total of 2,106 gynecological sarcoma (GS) were eligible for analysis. The uterus was the most common site with 87.2% of all cases. The annual age-standardized incidence rate was 7.7 per 1 million women for all gynecological sarcoma. The median age at diagnosis was 59 years. The prognosis ranged according to site and subtype from a poor 5-year-relative survival of 47.6% (uterine leiomyosarcoma) to a very good 5-year-relative survival of 97.2% (endometrial stromal sarcoma). Conclusions: Despite the rareness of gynecological sarcoma, the size of the dataset allows a differentiation of subtypes according to morphology and site of origin. Clinically relevant differences in incidence and prognosis between subgroups were observed.","title":"Incidence patterns and survival of gynecological sarcoma in Germany: Analysis of population-based cancer registry data on 2106 women, 2009-2013.","pubmedId":"ASCO_193522-199"}
