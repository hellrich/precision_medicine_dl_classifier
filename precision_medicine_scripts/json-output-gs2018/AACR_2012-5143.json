Glutaminolysis represents the first and rate-limiting step of glutamine utilization and is catalyzed by glutaminase. Previous studies have shown that c-Myc regulates glutaminolysis by increasing glutaminase expression in tumor cells. However, it remains unclear whether other oncogenic signaling pathways promote glutaminolysis. Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death for women in the United States and ErbB2 activation is one of the major causes of breast cancer. Using MCF10A and MCF10A-derived NeuT cells, we studied the effect of ErbB2 activation on glutaminase expression, and found that ErbB2 activation increased glutaminase 1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of ErbB2 decreased glutaminase 1 expression in several human ErbB2-positive cell lines. Consistently, blocking ErbB2 signaling pathway by trastuzumab repressed glutaminase 1 expression. We further showed that in these cells, ErbB2-mediated up-regulation of glutaminase 1 was independent of c-Myc expression. In addition, we found that activation of PI3K/Akt or MAPK pathway was not sufficient to up-regulate glutaminase 1 expression. Instead, inhibition of NF-B down-regulated glutaminase 1 expression whereas stimulation of NF-B induced glutaminase 1 expression, suggesting a PI3K/Akt-independent activation of NF-B signaling pathway up-regulates glutaminase 1. Finally, inhibition of glutaminase activity significantly decreased human breast cancer cell proliferation. Our data indicate that ErbB2 activation promotes glutaminase 1 expression via NF-B in breast cancer cells, identifying another oncogenic signaling pathway which stimulates glutamine utilization. These findings may facilitate the identification of novel targets for cancer therapy.","title":"ErbB2 activation up-regulates glutaminase 1 expression via NF-B pathway","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5143"}
