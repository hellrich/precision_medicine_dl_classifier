Real world administration of oncolytics is often associated with increased adverse event rates versus what is demonstrated in clinical trials. Whether the tumor biology, site of disease burden or underlying organ dysfunction dictates the differing immune side effect profile in various malignancies remains to be understood. Methods: The incidence of grade 2-4 irAE was abstracted from medical records of all patients (pts) treated with ICB (ipilimumab and/or nivolumab) from 2011 to 2016 at a single institution. Results: Of the 126 pts reviewed, 82 pts had metastatic lung cancer, 31 pts had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, 13 pts had metastatic renal cancer(RCC). In the melanoma cohort, concurrent or sequential PD-1 and CTLA4 blockade was used in 10/31 pts. All of the lung cancer and RCC patients received anti-PD-1 alone. In the patients with lung cancer: pneumonitis was identified in 24%, SIRS in 16%, thrombosis in 11%, cerebritis in 9%, colitis in 4%, hepatitis in 4%, thyroiditis in 5%. In RCC, 8% pts experienced pneumonitis and 8% had thyroiditis. In the melanoma population, colitis was identified in 19%, SIRS in 10%, pneumonitis in 3%, thrombosis in 6%, adrenalitis in 6%, hepatitis in 3%. Colitis was seen in 2/13(15%) pts who got ipilimumab alone and 4/10(40%) pts who got both ipilimumab and nivolumab. Conclusions: Pneumonitis, SIRS and cerebritisappear to be the most prevalent irAEs in lung cancer as compared to melanoma or RCC. The incidence of pneumonitis was higher in RCC compared to melanoma. Colitis appears to have a higher incidence in melanoma, the incidence of which further increases when CTLA4 inhibitors are used in conjunction with anti-PD-1. The majority of the RCC patients tolerated ICB with no major irAEs. With the expanding use of ICB in advanced malignancies, increased awareness of these clinically significant and potentially serious irAEs is indispensable. Future trials designed to distinguish the incidence of irAEs in relation to specific tumor types would be informative.
