The patient was treated by ruthenium plaque radiotherapy for the choroidal melanoma, which consequently flattened and scarred. On a routine eye check in 2014, the nevus was found to have been transformed into a choroidal melanoma. It was treated with ruthenium plaque radiotherapy.\nAlthough extremely rare, patients with a uveal melanoma can develop an additional discrete uveal melanoma. This case highlights the importance of monitoring benign choroidal nevi in patients with a history of choroidal melanoma.","title":"MALIGNANT TRANSFORMATION OF A CHOROIDAL NEVUS IN AN EYE TREATED FOR CHOROIDAL MELANOMA.","pubmedId":"27096381"}
