Six cases were reported in literature. It is debated, whether localizations are either metastatic lesions or part of multicentric disease. We present a 9-month-old boy with stage 4 neuroblastoma, in which an unsuspected scrotal localization was already present at birth. This lesion had not grown, in contrast to the other sites. The case illustrates that neuroblastoma is a multicentric tumor, originating in the adrenal area and paratesticular sympathic remnants. The lesions differed in clinical behavior. It further illustrates that multicentric localizations exhibit different clinical behavior.","title":"Paratesticular neuroblastoma: a case against metastatic disease?","pubmedId":"17356400"}
