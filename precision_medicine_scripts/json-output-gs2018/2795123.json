Microscopically, the lipid-laden tumor cells were GFAP-positive and exhibited marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism. In the present case the tumor was superficially located in the cerebral hemisphere, as opposed to the usual deep localization described by Kepes and Rubinstein, and others.","title":"Superficial location of malignant glioma with heavily lipidized (foamy) tumor cells: a case report.","pubmedId":"2795123"}
