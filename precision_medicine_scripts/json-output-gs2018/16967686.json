Left side-modified radical mastectomy was done. This was histopathologically diagnosed as an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the left breast. Periodic acid schiff (PAS) staining confirmed the diagnosis. Three of the five axillary lymph nodes excised were positive for malignancy. Although the patient was advised to have postoperative radiotherapy, he did not comply. After 2 years, the patient again presented with local recurrence of the disease. Wide excision of the recurrent malignant nodules over the anterior chest wall was done, and the defect was covered primarily with split thickness skin grafting. Postoperative radiation was given. For the past 9 months, the patient has maintained a regular follow-up on an outpatient basis. He does not have any evidence of recurrence of the tumor--neither locally nor distant metastasis.","title":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the male breast.","pubmedId":"16967686"}
