Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were performed on five ALCL derived cell lines and 32 tissue samples to confirm the SAGE data.\nHigh expression of Mcl-1 was seen in the Karpas299 cell line, whereas the two other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), were not detected in the SAGE library. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the high expression of Mcl-1 mRNA and low expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) in Karpas299 and in four other ALCL cell lines. To expand on these initial observations, primary tissue samples were analysed for Mcl-1, Bcl-X(L), and Bcl-2 by immunohistochemistry. All 23 ALK+ and nine ALK- ALCL cases were positive for Mcl-1. Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) were expressed infrequently in ALK+ ALCL cases, but were present in a higher proportion of ALK- ALCL cases.\nThe consistent high expression of Mcl-1 in ALK+ and ALK- ALCL suggests that Mcl-1 is the main antiapoptotic protein in this disease. The high frequency of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X(L) positive ALCL cases in the ALK- group compared with the ALK+ group indicates that ALK induced STAT3 activation is not the main regulatory pathway in ALCL.","title":"High expression of Mcl-1 in ALK positive and negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"15858125"}
