We examined whether serum 2HG levels in IDHm ICC pts may 1) serve as a surrogate biomarker for IDH status, 2) correlate with tumor burden, and 3) correlate with circulating proangiogenic biomarkers. Methods:  Blood samples from 33 ICC pts [11 IDHm, 22 IDH wild-type (IDHwt)] of different AJCC stages from MGH and 39 surgically resected ICC patients (7 IDHm, 32 IDHwt) from HKU were analyzed for serum 2HG concentration by reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Eight circulating proangiogenic biomarkers were measured in plasma using multiplex ELISA.  Results:  In the MGH cohort, median serum 2HG levels were significantly elevated in IDHm (478 ng/ml [interquartile range 174643]) versus IDHwt ICC pts (118ng/ml [68160])(p\u003c0.001). Similarly, in the HKU cohort, the pre-resection median serum 2HG levels were significantly elevated in IDHm (343ng/ml [192596]) versus IDHwt ICC pts (56ng/ml [4281]) (p\u003c0.0001). The area under ROC curve for prediction of an IDH mutation using 2HG was 93%; with a threshold of 2HG170ng/ml, the sensitivity was 83% and specificity was 90%. IDH2 mutations were more frequent in the HKU cohort (3/7, 43%) compared with the MGH cohort (0/11, 0%) (p\u003c0.05), but 2HG levels did not differ among the specific IDH1 or IDH2 allelic variants. 2HG levels correlated directly with tumor burden (Spearmans rho\u003d0.89; p\u003c0.05) in the HKU cohort. Median plasma levels of PlGFa growth factor from the VEGF-familywere higher in IDHm (35pg/ml [3340]) versus IDHwt ICC pts (median 26pg/ml [2434]) from the HKU cohort (p\u003c0.05). No other associations were seen between proangiogenic biomarkers and IDH status.  Conclusions:  IDHm ICC pts had significantly higher serum 2HG levels compared to IDHwt ICC pts. High serum 2HG correlated with increased tumor burden. Pre-resection circulating PlGF levels were higher in IDHm ICC versus IDHwt pts. These data support further exploration of circulating 2HG as potential surrogate and response biomarker in IDHm ICC.","title":"Circulating oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) as a potential surrogate biomarker in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutant (IDHm) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_116129-132"}
