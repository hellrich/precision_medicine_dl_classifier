HER-2/neu is expressed in many epithelial tumors and known to be overexpressed in approximately 20-25% of all ovarian and breast cancers, 35-45% of all pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and up to 90% of colorectal carcinomas. HER-2/neu overexpression represents a marker of poor prognosis. HER-2/neu-positive tumor cells are potentially good targets for tumor-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes which have been utilized in immunotherapeutic trials. In addition, the \"humanized\" monoclonal antibody Herceptin has been tested in several clinical trials and proved to be an effective adjuvant therapy for HER-2/neu-positive breast and ovarian cancers. Vaccinations aiming at generating T-cell responses are being examined in both experimental and clinical trials. Natural immunity at the level of T and B cells has been observed in patients with HER-2/neu-positive tumors confirming the immunogenicity of HER-2/neu and encouraging vaccination trials with HER-2 protein-derived subunits or synthetic peptides. This review summarizes recent data from patients with various types of HER-2/neu-overexpressing cancers carrying different HLA alleles and exhibiting preexistent immunity to HER-2/neu-derived synthetic peptides. It also discusses potential advantages of the various vaccination approaches to immunotherapy targeting the HER-2/neu molecule.","title":"Immunobiology of HER-2/neu oncoprotein and its potential application in cancer immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"14685781"}
