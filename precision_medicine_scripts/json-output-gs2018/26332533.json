GBCCs represent 0.4%-1% of all BCCs. The pathogenesis of GBCC is sometimes linked to a spontaneous mutation in the PTCH gene, mapped to the q22.33 locus of chromosome 9. The key factor in the development of GBCC, in at least 30% of the cases, is the delay in seeking medical attention (7.5 Â± 3.1 years). This is associated to a poor socioeconomic level, deficient hygiene, mental illness, advanced age, and the fact that BCCs are painless lesions. The authors present a Mexican female with a 2-year ulcer diagnosed as a GBCC in the year 2000, its initial therapeutic approach, and her follow-up during the next 12 years.
