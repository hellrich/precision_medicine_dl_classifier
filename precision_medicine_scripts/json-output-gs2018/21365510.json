Association between their expressions and clinical characteristics as well as prognosis were analyzed.\nIn patients with gastric cancer,expression rates were significantly higher than those in 15 normal gastric tissues for EGFR(55.9% vs. 20%, P\u003c0.05) and AKT(64.3% vs. 6.7%, P\u003c0.01). Expression of EGFR was associated with late staging(P\u003c0.01), while expression of AKT was associated with lymph node metastasis(P\u003c0.01). Overall 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in patients with EGFR negative expression (49.0% vs. 22.0%, P\u003c0.05). Overall 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in patients with AKT expression(45.7% vs. 30.2%, P\u003c0.05).\nExpression of EGFR and AKT negative may be used to evaluate the degree of differentiation and prognosis in patients with gastric carcinoma.","title":"[Expression and clinical significance of epidermal growth factor receptor and protein kinase B in gastric carcinoma].","pubmedId":"21365510"}
