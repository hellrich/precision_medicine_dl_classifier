A 34-year-old Korean female presented with a two-month history of progressive weakness in both legs. Spinal magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed a spinal cord tumor at the level of T4, which was hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging and hypointense on T2-weighted imaging. The intradural and extramedullary tumor was completely resected and diagnosed as melanoma. There were no metastatic lesions. At three years after surgery, the patient is still alive, with no evidence of tumor recurrence. We present the details of this case along with a comprehensive review of spinal cord melanoma.","title":"Primary spinal cord melanoma.","pubmedId":"20856666"}
