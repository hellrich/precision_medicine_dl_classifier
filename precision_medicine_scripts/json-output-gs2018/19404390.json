The biologic basis for NSCLC metastasis is not well understood.\nHere we addressed this deficiency by transcriptionally profiling tumors from a genetic mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma that develops metastatic disease owing to the expression of K-ras(G12D) and p53(R172H). We identified 2,209 genes that were differentially expressed in distant metastases relative to matched lung tumors. Mining of publicly available data bases revealed this expression signature in a subset of NSCLC patients who had a poorer prognosis than those without the signature.\nThese findings provide evidence that K-ras(G12D); p53(R172H) mice recapitulate features of human NSCLC metastasis and will provide a useful platform on which to study the biologic basis for lung adenocarcinoma metastasis and its prevention by novel agents.","title":"Expression signatures of metastatic capacity in a genetic mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19404390"}
