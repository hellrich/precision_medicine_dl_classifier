We hypothesized improved OS, disease-specific  survival (DSS), and lower relapse rates with the addition of C to APF given as induction chemotherapy before CRT. A nab-Paclitaxel-based induction chemotherapy regimen was chosen because we observed better survival outcomes in comparison to a docetaxel-based regimen (Cancer Medicine2014).  Methods:  Two consecutive prospective phase II trials (APF and APF+C) were performed: 30 pts  were treated with APF (weekly nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 and every 3 week cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and 5-FU 750 mg/m2/day x 3) and 30 pts were treated with APF+C (APF + weekly cetuximab 250 mg/m2). Pts were scheduled to receive three cycles followed by CRT (with cisplatin).     Results:  Pt and tumor characteristics for all 60 pts are as follows:  median age 57 (38-74) yrs, smoking history 83% (50 pts), p16+ Oropharynx (OPSCC) 57% (34 pts), T classification (T2-16 pts; T3-24 pts; T4-20 pts) and N classification (N0/1-11 pts; 2-38 pts; 3-11 pts). The distributions of age, smoking history, p16+ OPSCC, T and N classifications were similar between the two treatment groups. Two year OS (APF-C 90%, APF 93%) and DSS (APF-C 97%, APF 97%) were excellent in both treatment groups and not significantly different (Table); however, disease relapse occurred in five pts in the APF+C group vs 1 pt in the APF group (p \u003d .61, log rank ). When stratified for p16+ OPSCC and p16-HNSCC, no significant differences in 2 year OS or DSS occurred between the two treatment groups.     Conclusions:  Two year OS and DSS were similar between APF+C and APF, even when stratified for p16 status. These preliminary data do not support the addition of cetuximab to APF.
