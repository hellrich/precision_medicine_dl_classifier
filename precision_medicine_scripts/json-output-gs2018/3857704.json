The mean value of serum LDH levels in patients with high-risk factors was 2347 +/- 1490 U/ml (range 430-5460 U/ml), while in patients at standard risk it was 652 +/- 385 U/ml (range 110-1320 U/ml). The serum LDH values were above 1320 U/ml in 70% of the 13 children with high-risk factors. The serum isoenzyme patterns were analyzed in 17 of these children at the initial diagnosis. Although LDH-3 and LDH-2 were prominent at the time of diagnosis; LDH-2 and LDH-1 were the predominant isoenzymes in remission. The highest concentrations of LDH-3 were observed in the high-risk group at diagnosis and the ratio of LDH-3 to LDH-2 exceeding 1.0 was found in children who had high-risk factors, but not in any patients in the standard risk group.","title":"Prognostic value of the determination of serum lactic dehydrogenase and its isoenzymes in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","pubmedId":"3857704"}
