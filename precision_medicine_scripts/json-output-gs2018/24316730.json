Recent evidence suggests that lower expression of PRDXs correlates with cancer progression in colorectal cancer (CRC) or in esophageal squamous carcinoma. In the thyroid, increased levels of PRDX1 has been described in follicular adenomas and carcinomas, as well as in thyroiditis, while reduced levels of PRDX6 has been found in follicular adenomas. We studied the expression of PRDX1 and PRDX6, in a series of thyroid tissue samples, covering different thyroid diseases, including 13 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Our results show that PRDX1 and PRDX6 are significantly reduced in all PTCs compared to normal tissues, to non-neoplastic tissue (MNG) or follicular neoplasms. This reduction is strongly evident in PTCs harboring BRAF V600E (31% of our cases). Using TPC-1 and BCPAP and FRTL-5 cell lines, we demonstrate for the first time that the presence of BRAF V600E is responsible of the hypoexpression of PRDX1 and PRDX6 both at mRNA and protein levels. Finally, independently of BRAF status, we observe an interesting correlation between the tumor size, the presence of lymph node metastasis and the lowest PRDX1 and PRDX6 levels. Therefore, these data indicate that PRDX1 and PRDX6 expression not only may play a key role in papillary thyroid carcinogenesis via a BRAF V600E-dependent mechanism, but their determination could be considered as potential tumor marker for indicating tumor progression in PTCs, independently of BRAF status.","title":"PRDX1 and PRDX6 are repressed in papillary thyroid carcinomas via BRAF V600E-dependent and -independent mechanisms.","pubmedId":"24316730"}
