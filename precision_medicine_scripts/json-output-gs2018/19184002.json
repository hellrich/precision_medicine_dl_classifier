The complement cleavage peptides C5a and C3a recruit inflammatory cells and APC into the treated lesion. Anti-Gal further opsonizes the tumor cells and targets them for effective uptake by recruited APC, via Fc gamma receptors. These APC transport internalized tumor cells to draining lymph nodes, and present immunogenic tumor antigen peptides for activation of tumor specific T cells. The present study demonstrates the ability of alpha-gal glycolipids treatment to prevent development of metastases at distant sites and to protect against tumor challenge in the treated mice. Adoptive transfer studies indicate that this protective immune response is mediated by CD8+ T cells, activated by tumor lesions turned vaccine. This T cell activation is potent enough to overcome the suppressive activity of Treg cells present in tumor bearing mice, however it does not elicit an autoimmune response against antigens on normal cells. Insertion of alpha-gal glycolipids and subsequent binding of anti-Gal are further demonstrated with human melanoma cells, suggesting that intratumoral injection of alpha-gal glycolipids is likely to elicit a protective immune response against micrometastases also in cancer patients.","title":"Intratumoral injection of alpha-gal glycolipids induces a protective anti-tumor T cell response which overcomes Treg activity.","pubmedId":"19184002"}
