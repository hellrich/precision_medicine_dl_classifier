Up to now, no individual causal molecular markers for prognosis and therapeutic success have been identified. A tumorigenic connection between the oncogene product Mdm2 and tumor suppressor p53 is generally accepted, but their possible clinical relevance has not yet been investigated sufficiently in soft tissue sarcoma. In 86 primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (RO-resected, T1/2 N0 M0), Mdm2 and p53 overexpression were investigated by immunohistochemistry. The results were adjusted to clinico-pathological characteristics and evaluated for their prognostic relevance by multivariate analysis. In Cox\u0027s multivariate analysis with stratification of Mdm2 to p53 results, we determined four groups which had different prognostic values for relapse-free and overall survival (Mdm2-/p53- \u003c Mdm2-/p53+ \u003c Mdm2+/p53- \u003c Mdm2+/p53+). The most striking finding was a relative risk (rr) for overall survival of 18.77 (P\u003d0.006) for patients with Mdm2/p53 co-overexpression (n\u003d40). It is noticeably higher than the additive risk from both factors. Coincident Mdm2/p53 overexpression is an independent molecular marker with the highest prognostic relevance described for soft tissue sarcoma. Thus, a high risk sarcoma group has been defined which we believe requires alternative therapeutic approaches.","title":"High prognostic significance of Mdm2/p53 co-overexpression in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities.","pubmedId":"9528860"}
