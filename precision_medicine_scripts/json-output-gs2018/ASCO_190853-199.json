High TMB tumors including melanoma, lung cancer and those with microsatellite instability (MSI-H) are associated with susceptibility to immune blockade using checkpoint inhibitors. TMB data in BTC is limited and its association with actionable somatic mutation (mut) profiles in BTC is unknown. Methods: Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of 309 FFPE tissue blocks of BTC pts with a hybrid capture of all coding exons of 236 cancer-related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes rearranged in cancer was done using FoundationOne. Base substitutions, indels, gene fusion/rearrangements, TMB, and MSI status were assessed. TMB was calculated by counting mutations across a 1.25Mb region and classified into high (TMBH20 mut/Mb), intermediate (TMBI; 6 - 19mut/Mb) and low (TMBL\u003c 6mut/Mb). MSI high (MSIH) and Stable (MSS) status was assigned by a computational algorithm examining 114 intronic homopolymer loci. Patients with TMB 6 mut/Mb (N \u003d 60) were included in the clinical correlative portion of this study. Results: Sixty patients with TMB 6 mut were identified out of 309 pts of which 9 (15%) were TMBH and 51 (85%) were TMBI. These included 3 (5%) MSIH and 18 (30 %) MSS. The median age was 59 years (range: 29-86), 35 (58%) were females, majority were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n \u003d 31; 52%) and 28 (47%) presented with advanced disease at diagnosis. Twenty three (38%) pts had received radiation therapy, 28 (47%) surgery and 3 (5%) received immunotherapy. Most frequent co-existing mut seen was TP53 (N \u003d 35; 58%). APC mut was seen in 7 (12%) pts. DNA repair pathway muts (MSH6, BRCA1,BRCA2, ATM, MLH1, or MSH2 genes) were identified in 78% of TMBH versus 16% in TMBI cases (p \u003c 0.0001). Frequency of PIK3CA mut differed significantly between TMBH and TMBI (44% vs 10%, p \u003c 0.0001). Pts with TMBI had a significantly better median OS (110 weeks) as compared to TMBH (43 weeks) (p \u003d 0.003). Conclusions: DNA repair pathway and PIK3CA mut maybe associated with TMBH in BTC. A better understanding of TMB and associated actionable mutations in BTC may be of value for the management of BTC patients with targeted agents and immunotherapy.","title":"Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and co-existing actionable mutations in biliary tract cancers (BTC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_190853-199"}
