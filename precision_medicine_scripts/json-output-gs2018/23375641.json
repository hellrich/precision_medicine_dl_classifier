Its histology usually reflects a high-grade sarcoma, such as malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone or conventional osteosarcoma. Low-grade sarcoma arising from bone infarct has not been described well in the literature. Here, we present a 17-year follow-up of a female patient with bone infarct in her right humerus, from which a low-grade central osteosarcoma developed during follow-up. A histologic diagnosis of low-grade central osteosarcoma was confirmed by immunohistochemical expression of MDM2 and CDK4. She underwent a wide resection surgery. As of 4 years after surgery, she has remained free of any evidence of recurrence or metastasis. Here, we present clinical and pathologic findings of our case in detail and discuss the differential diagnoses of this extremely rare condition.","title":"Low-grade central osteosarcoma arising from bone infarct.","pubmedId":"23375641"}
