Exact quantification of erbB2 copy-number relative to chromosome 17 (CEP17) (ErbB2/CEP17 ratio \"R\") probably adds further important predictive information. Methods: Clinical data of 137 patients receiving trastuzumab based treatment for Her-2/neu overexpressing (IHC) metastatic breast cancer were analysed. ErbB2/CEP17 ratio (R) was determined by quantitative FISH analysis in original tumor tissue using Vysis PathVysion DNA-based FISH technology. Results: ErbB2/CEP17 (R) provided additional predictive value for progression free survival (PFS) and time to first metastasis (TTM), but not for overall survival (OS) (all from start of trastuzumab containing treatment). The following cutoffs of Her-2/neu were identified: group A: 0-2.2 R (TTM: 49.8; OS: 6.7; PFS: 6.2); group B: 2.2- 6 R (TTM: 26.2; OS: 5.3; PFS: 9.3); group C: \u003e6 CN (TTM: 20.1; OS: 3.9; PFS: 13.7) Kaplan-Maier analysis showed significant longer TTM for group A (p\u003c0.01 vs. B/C), significant longer PFS for group C (p\u003c0.01 vs. A/B). Significant differences in complete response (B/C: 16.9% vs C:44.4%), partial response (B/C: 20.2% vs. C: 33.3%) and progressive disease (B/C: 27% vs. 11.1%) were noted. No significant difference in overall survival between the groups was seen. Conclusions: ErbB/CEP17 R provides important prognostic information and, in metastatic patients, allows one to better predict response to trastuzumab-based treatment than the widely used binary classification of ErbB2 amplification that is based on a cut-off at a copy number of \u003e2.2.","title":"Use of the ErbB2/CEP17 ratio to predict prognosis and response to trastuzumab-based therapy in the metastatic breast cancer setting.","pubmedId":"ASCO_35073-65"}
