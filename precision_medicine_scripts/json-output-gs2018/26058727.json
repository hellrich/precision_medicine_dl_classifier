In melanoma, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis with monoclonal anti-BRAF V600E has emerged as a sensitive and specific surrogate of BRAF V600E mutation, particularly when BRAF V600E protein expression is homogeneous and strong. A subset of melanomas exhibit heterogeneous labeling for BRAF V600E, but our understanding of the significance of heterogeneous BRAF V600E IHC expression is limited. We used next-generation sequencing to compare BRAF V600E IHC staining patterns in 154 melanomas: 79 BRAF(WT) and 75 BRAF (including 53 V600E) mutants. Agreement among dermatopathologists on tumor morphology, IHC expression, and intensity was excellent (œÅ \u003d 0.99). A predominantly epithelioid cell phenotype significantly correlated with the BRAF V600E mutation (P \u003d .0085). Tumors demonstrating either heterogeneous or homogeneous IHC expression were significantly associated with the BRAF V600E mutation (P \u003c .0001), as was increased intensity of staining (P \u003c .0001). The positive predictive value was 98% for homogenous IHC expression compared with 70% for heterogeneous labeling. Inclusion of both heterogeneous and homogeneous BRAF V600E IHC expression as a positive test significantly improved IHC test sensitivity from 85% to 98%. However, this reduced BRAF V600E IHC test specificity from 99% to 96%. Cautious evaluation of heterogeneous BRAF V600E IHC expression is warranted and comparison with sequencing results is critical, given its reduced test specificity and positive predictive value for detecting the BRAF V600E mutation.
