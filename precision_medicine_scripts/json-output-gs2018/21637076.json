Chest x-ray revealed a right upper lobe mass. Biopsy demonstrated poorly differentiated non-small-cell carcinoma. F-18 fluoride positron emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) was performed to evaluate bone metastasis. Review of the sectional PET images demonstrated extraosseous fluoride uptake in the primary lung mass, as well as ring-shaped fluoride uptake in the cerebral metastatic lesion. Neither of these lesions demonstrated calcifications on CT images. The patient received radiation treatment of the brain metastasis after F-18 fluoride PET/CT study.","title":"Extraosseus uptake of F-18 fluoride in the primary malignancy and cerebral metastasis in a case of non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21637076"}
