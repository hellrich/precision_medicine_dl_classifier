However, in vitro treatment with a bcr/abl antisense oligomer did not completely abolish the expression of bcr/abl mRNA and did not display the desired \"killing effect\" on Ph1-positive leukemia cells. On the other hand, investigation of the effect on Ph1-positive leukemia cells by various types of protein kinase antagonists revealed that herbimycin A, a protein tyrosine kinase antagonist, displays preferential and remarkable suppression of the growth of Ph1-positive leukemia cells and P210bcr/abl associated transformed cells by virtue of suppressing bcr/abl protein tyrosine kinase activity. These results may provide important future insights in developing a new category of antitumor therapy by targeting oncogene products.","title":"BCR/ABL oncoprotein-targeted antitumor activity of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to bcr/abl mRNA and herbimycin A, an antagonist of protein tyrosine kinase: inhibitory effects on in vitro growth of Ph1-positive leukemia cells and BCR/ABL oncoprotein-associated transformed cells.","pubmedId":"7693103"}
