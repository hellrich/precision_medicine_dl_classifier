One of the challenges in the clinic is to develop suitable therapeutic strategies for the intermediate risk-type of patients (stage 3 or 4 without MYCN amplification) whose prognosis sometimes tends to be poor in terms of long-term follow-up (10 years survival rate was 51% in our database, n \u003d 161). To identify key biological pathways involved in the unfavorable phenotypes in this patient group, we have analyzed 63 primary tumors (dead:32, alive:31) without MYCN amplification nor ALK alteration by integrated genomic analyses such as array CGH, whole exome sequencing (SureSelect XT Human All Exon V4, average read depth:157, x20 coverage:95%), RNA sequencing, as well as Methylome profiling (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip). By using the Karkinos and ANNOVAR software, we found so far 816 non-synonymous somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in coding exons in total (approximately 20 per tumor in average) and number of alterations in each tumor strongly correlated with age at diagnosis (p\u003c0.0001) and patient prognosis (p \u003d 0.0077). Recurrent somatic SNVs (n \u003d 2 to n \u003d 5) were found in 66 genes, 19 of those were involved only in the tumors from the 24 patients with poor outcome. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis (GeneMANIA) using the 66 genes showed that mutations occurred in the features including cytoskeleton, ion channel and extracellular matrix were significantly correlated with patient survival of the 63 MYCN-non-amplified tumors with logrank p-values of 0.0039, 0.0482 and 0.0011, respectively. ATRX mutations were observed in four tumors (6.3%), all of them were occurred in patients with unfavorable phenotypes (3 dead, 1 alive but relapsed twice). By methylome signature, the 63 tumors were subdivided into at least three clusters, which also showed strong correlation with patient prognosis (cluster-1 vs. cluster-2 and -3, p \u003d 0.0368). Unfavorable cluster-2 and -3 exhibited hyper-methylation phenotypes in CpG islands and the former was quite similar to that of MYCN-amplified tumors. Thus, these prognosis-related genomic features could be useful markers for risk classification and help understanding molecular mechanism for aggressive phenotypes of MYCN-non-amplified neuroblastomas.","title":"Genomic landscape of aggressive tumor subtype in MYCN-non-amplified neuroblastoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2424"}
