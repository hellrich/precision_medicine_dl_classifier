ICC is relatively uncommon, but its incidence is on the increase. ICC is frequently discovered as an incidental, indeterminate liver mass. Surgical resection of ICC represents the only potentially curative therapeutic option. The role of routine hilar lymphadenectomy is controversial, but should be considered to optimize staging. Although adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably not supported by current data, each should strongly be considered in patients with lymph node metastasis or an R1 resection. For those patients with inoperable disease, locoregional therapy with transarterial chemoembolization can be considered.","title":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20637950"}
