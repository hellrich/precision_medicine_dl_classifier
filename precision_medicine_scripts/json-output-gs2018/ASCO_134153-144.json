Dosing schedule and route of administration changes have reduced its severity, but Bz-associated neuropathy remains debilitating for many patients (pts). Minocycline (M) is a widely used and inexpensive antibiotic that exhibits neuroprotective effects in animal models. We evaluated the potential of M to prevent deterioration of peripheral nerve (PN) function and reduce neuropathic symptoms in MM pts receiving a Bz-containing regimen.  Methods:  Eligible pts for this single institution, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial were pts with MM receiving induction with twice-weekly Bz. Pts were randomized to receive M (100 mg orally twice daily) or placebo (P) for 10 weeks.  Primary endpoint was change in PN function between baseline and week 10, as measured by change in touch detection threshold.  Change in patient-reported numbness was assessed by ratings on a 0-10 scale.  Covariates included route of Bz administration, baseline symptoms, age, gender, race, BMI, performance status, comorbidity index, and analgesics.  Results: Of 79 pts enrolled, touch detection measurements and symptom data are available in 36 (P\u003d17, M\u003d19) and 41 (P\u003d20, M\u003d21), respectively. There were no significant differences in clinician-rated toxicity between groups. No significant difference in observed fingertip touch detection was detected (P\u003d0.02 vs M\u003d0.03, 95%CI, -0.19, 0.17, effect size\u003d0.05). Mean increase in numbness from baseline to week 10 was 1.52 (SD\u003d2.36) and 0.70 (1.95) for the P and M groups, respectively. The observed absolute group difference of 0.82 in favor of minocycline was not statistically significant (95% CI: -0.55, 2.19, p\u003c0.23) but equivalent to an effect size of 0.49.  Conclusions: Deterioration of PN function could not be detected over the 10 week study period in either group, impeding quantitative evaluation of Ms neuroprotective potential. Still, we found a detectable, though non-statistically significant, positive signal in patient-reported numbness. Given Ms tolerability and availability, further evaluation in a larger study is warranted.
