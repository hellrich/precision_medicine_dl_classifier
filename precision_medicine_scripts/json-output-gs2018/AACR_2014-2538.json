Effective uptake of tumor cells by APC is achieved pre-clinically by labeling them with -gal glycolipids (-gal) and exploiting the natural anti-Gal antibody response that constitutes approximately 1% of immunoglobulins in humans. The current study involves intratumoral injection of glycolipids expressing -gal epitopes in patients (pts) with advanced melanoma and evaluates, in HLA-A2+ treated pts, the development of immune responses to common melanoma-associated antigens (MAA).Methods: Eligibility criteria included unresectable metastatic melanoma (recurrent stage III or stage IV); at least one readily resectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or readily palpable lymph node metastasis; and a serum anti-Gal titer above 1:50. Pts received 2 injections of alpha-gal glycolipids four weeks apart at 0.1 mg/injection (n\u003d3; dose level 1), 1.0 mg/injection (n\u003d3; dose level 2), or 10 mg/injection (n\u003d3; dose level 3). Ex vivo pre-treatment and Day 57 post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from pts who were HLA-A2+ (8 of 9 treated pts) were stained with pooled MAA pentamers (gp100209-217, gp100154-162, Melan-A/MART-126-35, NY-ESO-1157-165, and Tyrosinase368-376) and evaluated by flow cytometry. Cells stained with cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65495-504 or HTLV-1 Tax11-19 served as positive or negative controls, respectively.Results: MAA pentamer+ T cells were detected in 7 of 8 HLA-A2+ pts, both pre- and post-treatment. The frequency of MAA pentamer+ T cells post- versus pre-treatment increased approximately 2-fold for 2 pts [one from dose level 2 and one from dose level 3 (0.16% vs. 0.082%, and 0.033% vs. 0.017%, respectively (background subtracted))]. Similar increases were not observed for the other 5 pts with detectable MAA pentamer+ cells. Furthermore, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of MAA pentamer+ T cells, an indirect measure of T cell activation potential, was markedly higher post-treatment, as compared to pre-treatment, for 2 of 3 pts in dose level 1 (11227 vs. 3027, and 4045 vs. 1581). Substantial changes in MFI were not observed for the other pts..Conclusions: Intratumoral injection of -gal glycolipids can increase the ex vivo frequency of circulating MAA reactive T cells in some pts with advanced melanoma. Based on this finding, we are pursuing functional characterization of these pre- and post-treatment PBMC.","title":"Immune responses to common melanoma-associated antigens following intratumoral injection of alpha-gal glycolipids in patients with advanced melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2538"}
