There are some reports in the literature dealing with primary melanocytomas of the choroid and ciliary body. It is believed that most of these tumors are clinically diagnosed as nevi or melanoma, and are followed up or treated without surgical resection, respectively. Some clinical features can give a clue as to the correct diagnosis. We report on a 47-year-old white female with progressive visual loss of 2 months and right painful eye. Her visual acuity of finger counting was confined to 3.0m OD and 20/20 OS. Biomicroscopy OD showed a 360 degrees posterior synechia, and fundoscopy was not conclusive due to vitreous opacity. No alterations were seen on OS. Intraocular pressure was normal, and the pupillary reflex was present in both eyes. An ultrasound of the OD showed an elevated tumor on topography of the ciliary body and anterior choroid at the ora serrata level. Melanoma was the main diagnosis considered, and enucleation was indicated due to poor prognosis for visual acuity. Gross and histopathologic examinations of the OD showed a heavily pigmented tumor. The brownish pigment obscured the morphology of the tumor cells that could not be visualized by conventional H\u0026E stain. Bleached slides showed that tumor was composed of melanocytoma cells type I.","title":"Melanocytoma of ciliary body and choroids simulating melanoma.","pubmedId":"19410384"}
