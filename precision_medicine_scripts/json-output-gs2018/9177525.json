Small liver cancers \u003c2 cm in diameter (n \u003d 45) had a positivity rate of 15.6% with E-1023, 26.7% with the high sensitivity kit, and 31.1% with the new monoclonal antibody kit. The incidence of PIVKA-II positivity in patients with pancreatobiliary carcinoma (n \u003d 91) was 29.7% with the high sensitivity kit and 52.7% with the new monoclonal antibody kit. The PIVKA-II ratio (plasma concentration with the high sensitivity kit/plasma concentration with the new monoclonal antibody kit) was calculated as \u003e 1.0 in 89 of the 113 (78.8%) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with the new monoclonal antibody kit assay level above 0.002 arbitrary units/ml, compared with \u003c1.0 in almost all patients with pancreatobiliary malignancies.\nMU-3 has much greater affinity for PIVKA-II in hepatocellular carcinoma than does 19B7, whereas 19B7 has much greater affinity for PIVKA-II in pancreatobiliary malignancies than does MU-3. The new monoclonal antibody, 19B7, is useful for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma and can also distinguish patients with hepatocellular carcinoma from those with other pancreatobiliary malignancies when combined with a PIVKA-II assay using the conventional monoclonal antibody, MU-3.","title":"Clinical application of a new monoclonal antibody (19B7) against PIVKA-II in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatobiliary malignancies.","pubmedId":"9177525"}
