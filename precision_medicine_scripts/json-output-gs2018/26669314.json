Sentinel node biopsy must be done when tumor is over 1 mm or if less with high-risk factors. Adjuvant therapy with interferon must be offered for patients with high-risk melanoma and in selected cases radiotherapy can be added. Metastatic melanoma treatment is guided by mutational BRAF status. BRAF wild type patients must receive anti-PD1 therapy and BRAF mutated patients BRAF/MEK inhibitors or anti-PD1 therapy. Up to 10 years follow up is recommended for melanoma patients with dermatologic examinations and physical exams.","title":"SEOM guidelines for the management of Malignant Melanoma 2015.","pubmedId":"26669314"}
