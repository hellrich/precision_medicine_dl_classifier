The cytologic preparations studied represent the two major groups of histological types of lung cancer: Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) and Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) (squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma). The differential expression of ras p21 oncoprotein correlated with histological classification and was found in 30% of 23 small cell lesions, 61% of 28 squamous cell lung carcinomas and 32% of 22 adenocarcinomas. The ras p21 oncoprotein was commonly expressed in NSCLC cases (48%) as compared to SCLC cases (30%).","title":"Immunocytochemical study of RAS oncoprotein in cytologic specimens of primary lung tumours.","pubmedId":"2164347"}
