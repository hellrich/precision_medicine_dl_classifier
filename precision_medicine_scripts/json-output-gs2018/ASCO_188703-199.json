However, compared with their cutaneous counterpart, acral melanoma (AM) and mucosal melanoma (MM) have distinct genetic patterns and worse prognosis. The efficacy and safety profiles of vemurafenib in AM and mm remain unclear. Methods: Clinical, pathological, and therapeutic data were collected and reviewed of patients (pts) with metastatic or unresectable BRAF-mutant AM and mm hospitalized and administrated vemurafenib during January 2011 and January 2017. Responses were evaluated by RECIST v1.1, survival data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve, and adverse effects were assessed by CTCAE v4.0. Results: 24 pts were identified, 13 (54.2%) with AM, 11 (45.8%) with mm (1 patient without available radiology data). All 13 AM pts harbored BRAF V600E mutation (1 with simultaneous C-KIT E861K mutation); 10/11 (90.9%) mm pts carried BRAF V600E mutation (1 with simultaneous PDGFRA V824I mutation), 1/11 (9.1%) had BRAF D594N mutation. Median PFS were 5.4 (95%CI 3.5-8.7) and 4.5 (95%CI 1.5-15.0) months, median OS were 11.7 (95%CI 8.1-23.6) and 7.9 (95%CI 4.6-26.2) months; ORRs were 61.5% (8/13) and 40.0% (4/10), DCRs were 92.3% (12/13) and 90.0% (9/10) in AM and MM, respectively. Vemurafenib was well tolerated. The most common adverse effects (AEs) were hand-foot syndrome in AM and elevation of total cholesterol in MM, with the incidence of 23.1% (3/13) and 18.2% (2/11), respectively. Grade 3/4 AEs have not been observed. No patient discontinued vemurafenib because of treatment related toxicity. Conclusions: Vemurafenib yields substantial response in pts with AM and MM. Compared with in CM, vemurafenib has similar efficacy and safety profiles in BRAF-mutant AM and MM.","title":"Efficacy and tolerability of vemurafenib in BRAF-mutant acral and mucosal melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_188703-199"}
