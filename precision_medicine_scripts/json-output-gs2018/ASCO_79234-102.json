Nevertheless, there is currently no evidence-based indication to modify treatment according to the HPV status.  Methods:  Papillophar is a multicentric (15 clinical, 5 biological centers) prospective study. The aim is to study the role of HPV characteristics in OSCC prognosis.  With a clinical database (including follow-up), tumor and serum collections are constituted to analyse virological parameters of HPV positive tumors (HPV genotype, variants, load, DNA integration, E6-E7 transcript expression, L1 gene methylation, HPV serology), molecular tumor markers (EGFR, Kras, PTEN, PI3KCA, c-MET mutations), immunohistochemistry analysis (p16, p53, pRb, markers of EMT (vimentin, E-cadherine, beta-catenin) expression).  Primary endpoint is Disease Free Survival (DFS) at 2 years according to HPV status. Secondary endpoints are: Overall Survival at 2 years; virological characteristics in HPV-positive tumors; molecular tumor characteristics in HPV positive vs negative tumors.  We hypothesized that DFS in HPV-negative cancer is similar to DFS in OSCC (about 40%). To detect at least a 20% difference in DFS at 2 years, 324 patients are needed (25% HPV positive patients, 80% power, alpha equals 5%, two-sided). No interim analysis is planed. Prognosis value of HPV status on endpoints will be assessed using Cox regression hazard model independently from baseline characteristics.  Patients are treated according to the usual multidisciplinary approach in each center and followed according to the recommendations of the French Otolaryngology head neck surgery Society. At least 2 years of follow-up after the completion of the treatment will be required.  Major eligibility criteria are: invasive OSCC confirmed histologically in adult patients, all TNM stages and first head and neck cancer. SCC of other localization, non-invasive neoplasia and synchronous head and neck carcinomas are excluded.  Enrollment has begun in May 2009. At this time (January 2011), 198 OSCC patients have been included and 34 % have reached 12 months of follow-up.
