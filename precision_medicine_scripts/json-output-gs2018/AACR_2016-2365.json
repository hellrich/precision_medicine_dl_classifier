We have isolated five patient derived melanoma cell lines (MEL-V, 3MM, GLM2, Mel2, KFM) and characterized the expression of various melanoma associated antigens (MAAs). The presence of a multitude repertoire of common MAAs (Gp100, MART-1, MAGE-A1, NY-ESO-1, Tyrosinase, TRP-1 (Gp75), TRP-2, Melanotransferrin, CD71, CD146) enabled us to use composite cell membrane preparations of these cells as a multivalent vaccine. To this end, we designed a vaccinia virus vaccine that was composed of membrane lysate preparations of the five primary cells and recombinant IL-2. When tested in a pilot study, delayed type hypersensitivity and a multivalent immune response were noted. In an effort to correlate genetic lesions with MAA expression we observed that in BRAF mutant melanoma cells, treatment with a BRAFv600E inhibitor, PLX4032, enhanced the expression of MAAs making the melanoma cells more visible to the vaccination driven immune response. We also observed that melanoma cells constitutively expressed CTLA-4 as determined by Immunofluorescence and Western Blots. This expression was found on the membranes as well as in the cytoplasm in comparatively high levels on wild type as well as the BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines. Further our results suggest that CTLA-4 expression on melanoma cells promotes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment enabling tumor evasion. Given that CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies such as Ipilimumab are approved for clinical treatment, this study opens up a new avenue into a plausible combinatorial therapy for our vaccinia virus based vaccine with Ipilimumab for BRAF mutant as well as wild type melanoma cells.","title":"Checkpoint inhibitors and a multivalent melanoma vaccine as a novel combinatorial therapy","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2365"}
