ALCL sometimes can involve the bone marrow, and in advanced stages, it can produce destructive bone lesions. But ALK+ ALCL with prominent bone involvement is very rare, especially in children.\nA 13-year-old boy presented with waist pain and low-grade fever for 8 months. The biopsy of soft tissue lesions around the thoracic spine showed that these cells were positive for ALK-1, CD30, leukocyte common antigen, CD3, CD4, and CD8, as well as being negative for epithelial membrane antigen and pan-cytokeratin, which revealed ALCL. After six cycles of a regimen consisting of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone/methotrexate and cytarabine (hyper-CVAD/MA) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, he achieved complete remission (CR).\nIt is generally believed that the regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) is also applicable to ALCL. Because of the tendency of rapid progression and the frequency of B symptoms, ALCL in children and young adults is treated with high-grade chemotherapy such as hyper-CVAD/MA.","title":"ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma with prominent bone involvement in a 13-year-old boy.","pubmedId":"26834485"}
