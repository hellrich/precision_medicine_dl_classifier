The cultures were divided in two groups: I group (control group)--the cells were grown in 199-medium; II group--the cells were in 199-medium supplemented with 0.03 mg/ml of DTIC. Immunohistochemical studies were performed with paraffin-embedded material of the cultures by the avidin-biotin-alkaline phosphatase technique. Araldit-embedded material was studied by electron microscopy.\nThe expression of HMB-45 and S100 protein in the cultures with DTIC ranged from slightly positive to negative. The tumor cells were severely damaged. Electron microscopy in this group showed presence only of cellular fragments. In the DTIC-free group the HMB-45 and S100 expressions were strongly positive. There were no electron microscopic evidence of cellular death.\nDTIC suppresses the growth of choroidal melanoma in vitro. These results indicate that further studies are warranted to elucidate the effect of DTIC in vivo.","title":"Effect of dacarbazine (DTIC) on cultures from malignant melanoma of the choroid: an immunohistochemical and electron microscopic study.","pubmedId":"10658360"}
