Recent success with antibodies blocking immune checkpoints in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) highlights the potential of immunotherapy for lung cancer treatment, and the need for trials of combination regimens of immunotherapy plus chemotherapy that lead to immunogenic cell death. Here, we review the development of immunogenic cytotoxic compounds, vaccines, and antibodies in NSCLC, in view of their integration into personalised oncology.
