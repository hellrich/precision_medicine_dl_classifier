Physical and chemical analyses were carried out to focus the properties of new bio-sensing gel. Afterwards paclitaxel was loaded in the graphene based gel and drug delivery was carried out for dermal delivery, using a biomembrane, a fish swim-bladder in vitro. Kinetic studies were evaluated for feasibility as dermal delivery. Getting information from the kinetic parameters, paclitaxel was delivered to the melanoma cell lines from the gel and cell apoptosis was performed by trypan blue staining. FTIR studies were performed to evaluate the IR-signal transmission between the GO/Pectin/NaCl blend gel and Pectin/NaCl gel. And the same signal was evaluated from that of paclitaxel loaded GO/Pectin/NaCl treated melanoma cells and normal endothelial cells. All our data suggests that GO/Pectin/NaCl blend gel might be a future diagnostic as well as curable anticancer carrier for local cancer therapy.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.","title":"Graphene/Pectin-NaCl based gel-biosensor for tracing skin cancer and delivery of anticancer drug paclitaxel","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4535"}
