However, the underline mechanism is still unclear, especially in acral melanoma. MAPK and AKT pathway is involved in tumor survival and apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of propranolol on melanoma in the A375, two primary acral melanoma cell lines and mice model. In this study, propranolol significantly reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis by activating intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and inhibiting MAPK and AKT pathway in vitro. Meanwhile, we further highlighted that low dose propranolol could slow down the growth of tumor in immunodeficient mice engrafted with human melanoma cells. Thus, our data firstly showed that propranolol may inhibit melanoma by activating intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and regulating MAPK pathway and AKT pathway.","title":"Propranolol induces G0/G1/S phase arrest and apoptosis in melanoma cells via AKT/MAPK pathway","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2992"}
