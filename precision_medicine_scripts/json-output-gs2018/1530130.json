The ASB consists of 30 situations. Fifteen situations require subjects\u0027 typical responses and 15, their optimal responses. Male and female alcoholics were inferior to controls in their typical responses [F(1,57) \u003d 45.22, p \u003d 0.0001], but did not differ on the optimal responses (F less than 1). Further analyses indicated that decreased feelings of self-efficacy could not account for the alcoholic deficit. Females were superior to males in the optimal response condition [(F(1,56) \u003d 9.90, p \u003d 0.003]. No significant group x sex interactions were obtained. Performance on the ASB was not correlated with performance on traditional measures of problem-solving. Post-hoc correlational analyses revealed differential patterns between depression scores and performance for alcoholics and controls. These data suggest that (1) female and male alcoholics exhibit similar interpersonal problem-solving deficits, (2) alcoholic self-efficacy expectancies cannot account for the impairment, (3) the ASB appears to assess aspects of problem-solving not typically examined, and (4) the role of depression in alcoholic performance deserves continued empirical evaluation.","title":"Interpersonal problem-solving in male and female alcoholics.","pubmedId":"1530130"}
