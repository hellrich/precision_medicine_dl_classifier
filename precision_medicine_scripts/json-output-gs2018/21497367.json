Here, we report a refractory anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive large B-cell lymphoma in a 49-year-old human immunodeficiency virus-positive man. The neoplastic cells expressed CD138, epithelial membrane antigen, CD45, and perforin, and showed a strong granular cytoplasmic anaplastic lymphoma kinase staining pattern. Conventional chromosome analysis revealed a clone with multiple anomalies and a chromosome count of 76 to 79. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed 5 copies of the ALK gene with 2 intact signals and 3 signals resulting from 2 independent, previously unreported, rearrangements. One rearrangement, seen in 2 copies, involved translocation of ALK sequences to chromosome Xq21. The second rearrangement involved translocation of ALK sequences to chromosome 12q24.1. This case broadens the cytogenetic alterations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive large B-cell lymphoma, and it also demonstrates the high genetic instability of this tumor.","title":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive large B-cell lymphoma with complex karyotype and novel ALK gene rearrangements.","pubmedId":"21497367"}
