The most common central nervous system gliomas traditionally are thought to arise from mature astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. We examined the possibility that gliomas arise from a population of glia that has properties of oligodendrocyte progenitors. These glial cells express the NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and the alpha receptor of platelet-derived growth factor in vivo. We identified NG2 and the alpha receptor of platelet-derived growth factor expression in tissue from seven of seven oligodendrogliomas, three of three pilocytic astrocytomas, and one of five glioblastoma multiforme. These data provide evidence that glial tumors arise from glial progenitor cells. Molecules expressed by these progenitor cells should be considered as targets for novel therapeutics.","title":"Expression of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell antigens by gliomas: implications for the histogenesis of brain tumors.","pubmedId":"10468613"}
