Here, we present an immunohistochemical analysis of the expression pattern of ET-1 receptor subtypes (ET(A)-R and ET(B)-R) and a functional study of their potential role in human oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas. By comparison, we assessed the corresponding expression patterns of glioblastomas. Interestingly, a nuclear localization of ET-1 receptor subtypes (associated or not with a cytoplasmic labeling) was constantly observed in tumor cells from all three glioma types. Moreover, we noted a distinct receptor distribution in the different gliomas: a nuclear expression of ET(B)-R by tumor cells was found to be restricted to oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas, while a nuclear expression of ET(A)-R was only detected in tumor cells from some glioblastomas. Using primary cultures of oligodendroglial tumor cells, we confirmed the selective expression of nuclear ET(B)-R, together with a plasma membrane expression, and further demonstrated that this receptor was functionally coupled to intracellular signaling pathways known to be involved in cell survival and/or proliferation: extracellular signal-regulated kinase and focal adhesion kinase activation, actin cytoskeleton reorganization. In addition, impairment of ET(B)-R activation in these cells by in vitro treatment with an ET(B)-R-specific antagonist induced cell death. These data point to ET-1 as a possible survival factor for oligodendrogliomas via ET(B)-R activation and suggest that ET(B)-R-specific antagonists might constitute a potential therapeutic alternative for oligodendrogliomas.","title":"Functional endothelin ET B receptors are selectively expressed in human oligodendrogliomas.","pubmedId":"15950764"}
