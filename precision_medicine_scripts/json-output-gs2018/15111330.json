Among 36 de novo PTCL NOS, recurrent chromosomal losses were found on chromosomes 13q (minimally overlapping region 13q21, 36% of cases), 6q and 9p (6q21 and 9p21-pter, in 31% of cases each), 10q and 12q (10q23-24 and 12q21-q22, in 28% of cases each), and 5q (5q21, 25% of cases). Recurrent gains were found on chromosome 7q22-qter (31% of cases). In 11 PTCL NOS, high-level amplifications were observed, among them 3 cases with amplification of 12p13 that was restricted to cytotoxic PTCL NOS. Whereas cutaneous ALCL and ALK-positive ALCL showed few recurrent chromosomal imbalances, ALK-negative ALCL displayed recurrent chromosomal gains of 1q (1q41-qter, 46%), and losses of 6q (6q21, 31%) and 13q (13q21-q22, 23%). Losses of chromosomes 5q, 10q, and 12q characterized a group of noncytotoxic nodal CD5+ peripheral T-cell lymphomas. The genetics of PTCL NOS and ALK-negative ALCL differ from other T-NHLs characterized genetically so far, among them enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia.","title":"Genomic profiling of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified, and anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma delineates novel recurrent chromosomal alterations.","pubmedId":"15111330"}
