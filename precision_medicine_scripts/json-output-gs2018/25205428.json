Here, we examined the efficacy of a selective ALK inhibitor alectinib/CH5424802 in preclinical models of intracranial tumors.\nWe established intracranial tumor implantation mouse models of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC NCI-H2228 and examined the antitumor activity of alectinib in this model. Plasma distribution and brain distribution of alectinib were examined by quantitative whole-body autoradiography administrating a single oral dose of (14)C-labeled alectinib to rats. The drug permeability of alectinib was evaluated in Caco-2 cell.\nAlectinib resulted in regression of NCI-H2228 tumor in mouse brain and provided a survival benefit. In a pharmacokinetic study using rats, alectinib showed a high brain-to-plasma ratio, and in an in vitro drug permeability study using Caco-2 cells, alectinib was not transported by P-glycoprotein efflux transporter that is a key factor in blood-brain barrier penetration.\nWe established intracranial tumor implantation models of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC. Alectinib showed potent efficacy against intracranial EML4-ALK-positive tumor. These results demonstrated that alectinib might provide therapeutic opportunities for crizotinib-treated patients with brain metastases.","title":"Antitumor activity of the selective ALK inhibitor alectinib in models of intracranial metastases.","pubmedId":"25205428"}
