Methods: We find that a 75-year male patient with KIT-mutated metastatic mucosal (primary: nasal, metastasis: left adrenal gland, lungs and right eye) melanoma has a very good response to sunitinib 37.5mg/d consecutively. We apply IHC sp assay to detect S100, HMB-45, CD117, VEGFR, PDGFR and EGFR in the melanoma sample of this patient. DNA is also extracted from paraffin-embedded melanoma sample of this patient and PCR is carried out to amplify several exons of C-KIT (exon11,13,17,18),B-RAF(exon11, 15) and N- RAS(exon1, 2). PCR products are sent to be directly sequenced. Clinical response, PFS and OS of the patient are evaluated. Results: Strong expression of S100, HMB45, CD117, VEFGR and PDGFR is detected by IHC in the tissue sample of the patient. Furthermore, direct sequencing after PCR reveals that V559A substitution is detected in exon 11 of KIT, with mutation of T into C at 1776, leading to substitution of Valine by Alanine at 559. No mutation was detected in exon 9, 13, 17, 18 of KIT, B-RAF15, 11 or N-RAS1, 2. The patient received sunitinib 37.5mg/d from July 2008 consecutively and evaluated PR (Recist: tumors shrink 70%) lasting for 5 months with Grade II myelosuppression and stomatitis. Now the patient is still alive and received sunitinib. Conclusions: Our case report suggests that response of melanoma patients to sunitinib might be correlated to KIT mutation and expression, and large-scale clinical trial in patients with KIT mutation and over-expression might be useful to shed light on treatment of melanoma patients with individual targeted therapy.","title":"Response to sunitinib in Chinese KIT-mutated metastatic mucosal melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32579-65"}
