Because current therapeutic methods for metastatic melanoma are poorly efficacious, enhanced understanding of signal transduction in melanoma progression is warranted. Prior experimental studies in murine models and human tissues have shown a correlation among activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. Because of these findings, we wanted to assess the role of MAPK signaling in melanoma progression and angiogenesis.\nWe studied expression of phosphorylated (active) MAPK and two target genes known to be induced by MAPK signaling, tissue factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, in 131 melanocytic lesions, ranging from atypical nevi to metastatic melanoma.\nWe observed little staining for activated (phosphorylated) MAPK and low amounts of angiogenesis in atypical nevi, but angiogenesis and MAPK activation were activated in radial growth melanoma and in later stage lesions.\nOur findings implicate MAPK activation as an early event in melanoma progression, and MAPK may be a potential target for pharmacologic intervention.","title":"Mitogen-actived protein kinase activation is an early event in melanoma progression.","pubmedId":"12473582"}
