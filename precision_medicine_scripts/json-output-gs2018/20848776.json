The expression of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) of SGC-7901 cells was detected by immunocytochemistry. ERK and p-ERK expression were determined by immunoblot. The TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect apoptosis.\nWhen SGC-7901 cells was treated with AG1478 or celecoxib alone, cell growth was only inhibited by high concentration of the two agents (10, 100 micromol/L) significantly, the IC50 of AG1478 and celecoxib were 69.69 micromol/L and 70.98 micromol/L respectively. Compared with AG1478 or celecoxib alone, combination of AG1478 and celecoxib at different doses significantly enhanced the inhibitive effects on cell growth (P \u003c 0.01). Compared with control (56. 55%), the expression of PCNA was decreased in the cells treated with AG1478, celecoxib and the combination of these two agents, PCNA indeices were 26.24%, 38.16%, and 9.08%, respectively (P \u003c 0.01). AG1478 induced cell apoptosis at 10 micromol/L, the rate was 7.88% vs. 3.54% in control (P \u003c 0.01), and the combination of AG1478 with celecoxib showed an enhanced effect, the apoptosis rate was 14.90%. There were no any effects on ERK expression with the treatments of either AG1478, celecoxib alone or toghether, but the phospholation of ERK was decreased by AG1478 (P \u003c 0.01).\nAG1478 combined with celecoxib results in enhanced inhibitive effect on the growth of SGC-7901, which may partly due to the suppression of ERK phospholation.","title":"[Effects of EGFR inhibitor AG1478 in combination with celecoxib on the growth of gastric cancer cells].","pubmedId":"20848776"}
