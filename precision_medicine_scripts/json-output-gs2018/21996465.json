Most of the thio-benzodiazepines had nanomolar to micromolar affinity toward MDM2. Particularly, compounds 8a (K(i) \u003d 0.52μM) and 8f (K(i) \u003d 0.32 μM) showed binding activity comparable to the positive drug nutlin-3a (K(i) \u003d 0.23 μM). Meanwhile, compound 8j exhibited excellent antitumor activity against the U-2 OS human osteosarcoma cell line with an IC(50) value of 1.06 μM, which was about 23 times higher than that of nutlin-3a. The docking model also successfully predicted that this class of compounds mimicked three p53 critical residues binding to MDM2. The thio-benzodiazepines represent a promising class of non-peptide inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction.","title":"Synthesis and biological evaluation of thio-benzodiazepines as novel small molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction.","pubmedId":"21996465"}
