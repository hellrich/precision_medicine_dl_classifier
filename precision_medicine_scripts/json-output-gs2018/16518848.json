The main BCR-ABL1 breakpoints result in P190 BCR-ABL1 or P210 BCR-ABL1 fusion proteins. The latter is found in almost all cases of CML and in one third of the cases of t(9;22)-positive adult B-ALL. P190 BCR-ABL1 is found in the remaining two thirds of t(9;22)-positive adult B-ALL cases but only exceptionally in CML. We describe here the first case of t(9;22)(q34;q11) associated with t(10;11)(p13;q14) in acute monocytic leukemia. The recurrent t(10;11)(p13;q14) translocation, usually found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-ALL, merges PICALM to MLLT10. RT-PCR enabled identification of PICALM-MLLT10 and BCR-ABL1 e1-a2 fusion transcripts; in the context of chronic and acute myeloid leukemia, the latter usually has a monocytic presentation. We also identified overexpression of HOXA9, a gene essential to myeloid differentiation that is expressed in PICALM-MLLT10 and MLL-rearranged acute leukemias. This case fits with and extends a recently proposed multistage AML model in which constitutive activation of tyrosine kinases by mutations (BCR-ABL1) are associated with deregulation of transcription factors central to myeloid differentiation (HOXA9 secondary to PICALM-MLLT10).","title":"Acute monocytic leukemia with coexpression of minor BCR-ABL1 and PICALM-MLLT10 fusion genes along with overexpression of HOXA9.","pubmedId":"16518848"}
