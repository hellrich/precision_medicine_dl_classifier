Clinical trials for chemoprevention are involving more diverse regimens, following disappointing results of retinoid monotherapy. In-vitro and animal studies form the rationale for the next generation of studies, employing combination, synergistic treatments.\nBased on trial data to date, no recommendation for intervention with a chemopreventive agent can be made. It is clear, however, that smoking cessation is an effective intervention for preventing oral premalignant lesions and second primary tumors. Promising trials are being conducted and designed currently. The future of this area of study will involve rational choice of multidrug regimens based on current understanding of the biology of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","title":"Chemoprevention of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"17414634"}
