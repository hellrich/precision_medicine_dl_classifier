HRMAA detected mutations in 87 GISTs (91%). Of the 87 cases, 69 (79%) contained c-kit mutations and 18 (21%), PDGFRA mutations. One c-kit mutation-positive case contained an exon 9 mutation, ins FY at codon 503, that has not been previously described. One PDGFRA mutation-positive case contained mutation D842V del 843, also not previously described. Of 18 PDGFRA mutation-positive cases, 3 (17%) were strongly positive for kit expression as measured by CD117 immunohistochemical analysis. Of 69 c-kit mutation-positive cases, 66 (96%) showed strong kit immunohistochemical expression, but 3 (4%) showed negative to weak CD117 expression. Of 96 cases, 9 (9%) were wild type for c-kit and PDGFRA. Of the wild-type cases, 8 still showed strong immunohistochemical kit expression, whereas 1 showed weak kit expression. GISTs with PDGFRA mutations were found in the stomach, omentum, and peritoneum but not the small intestine. GISTs with c-kit exon 9 mutations were found primarily in the small intestine. HRMAA is a sensitive technique that can be used to rapidly identify c-kit and PDGFRA activating mutations in GISTs.","title":"High-resolution melting amplicon analysis as a method to detect c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha activating mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"17638656"}
