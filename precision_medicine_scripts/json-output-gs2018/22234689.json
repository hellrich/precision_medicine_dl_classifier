In the present study, we used mice with a conditional null mutation in the Stat5a/b gene locus to determine the requirement for STAT5 in MPNs induced by BCR-ABL1 and JAK2(V617F) in retroviral transplantation models of CML and PV. Loss of one Stat5a/b allele resulted in a decrease in BCR-ABL1-induced CML-like MPN and the appearance of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, whereas complete deletion of Stat5a/b prevented the development of leukemia in primary recipients. However, BCR-ABL1 was expressed and active in Stat5-null leukemic stem cells, and Stat5 deletion did not prevent progression to lymphoid blast crisis or abolish established B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. JAK2(V617F) failed to induce polycythemia in recipients after deletion of Stat5a/b, although the loss of STAT5 did not prevent the development of myelofibrosis. These results demonstrate that STAT5a/b is essential for the induction of CML-like leukemia by BCR-ABL1 and of polycythemia by JAK2(V617F), and validate STAT5a/b and the genes they regulate as targets for therapy in these MPNs.","title":"Essential role for Stat5a/b in myeloproliferative neoplasms induced by BCR-ABL1 and JAK2(V617F) in mice.","pubmedId":"22234689"}
