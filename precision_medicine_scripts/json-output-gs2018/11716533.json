Studies were performed with two human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, H226b, which has wild-type p53, and H226br, which has a mutant p53. The combination of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha significantly inhibited cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death of both H226b and H226br, compared with IFN-alpha or TNF-alpha alone. Treatment with one or both cytokines did not affect the expression level of p53 in both cell lines. These results suggest that the combination of IFN-alpha/TNF-alpha induces apoptotic cell death through a p53- independent pathway. The c-myc oncogene is known to be involved in apoptosis induced by TNF. Antisense c-myc oligonucleotides have been reported to modulate cell growth or apoptosis in several cell lines. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were added to the culture of H226br cells before the addition of IFN-alpha/TNF-alpha. Antisense c-myc inhibited IFN-alpha/TNF-alpha cytotoxicity and apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, this study provides support for the speculation that TNF-alpha/IFN-alpha induce apoptosis through a c-myc-dependent pathway rather than a p53-dependent pathway.
