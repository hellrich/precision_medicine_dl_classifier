The protein patched homolog 1 gene (PTCH1) is associated with NBCCS development and tumor genesis associated with this syndrome. However, previous studies have revealed that more than 85% of syndromic KCOTs and less than 30% of sporadic KCOTs harbor PTCH1 mutations. The significantly lower PTCH1 mutation rates observed in sporadic KCOTs suggest that they serve a minor role in pathogenesis. We aimed to discern the importance of PTCH1 mutations in sporadic KCOTs.\nPTCH1 mutational analysis was performed with 19 new sporadic KCOT cases by direct sequencing of epithelial lining samples separated from fibrous capsules. Using this approach, we further reexamined 9 sporadic KCOTs that were previously reported to lack PTCH1 mutations by our group.\nNineteen PTCH1 mutations were detected in patient samples from 16/19 new cases (84%) all these mutations were absent in fibrous tissues and peripheral blood specimens from the same patients. We also identified four PTCH1 mutations in 3/9 patients (33%) that were previously undetected.\nThese data indicated that PTCH1 mutations occur in sporadic KCOTs at a higher rate than previously suspected, owing to the masking effects of the attached stromal tissues in the test samples. These results suggest that the PTCH1 gene plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of sporadic KCOTs, which is comparable to that observed in NBCCS patients.","title":"Underestimated PTCH1 mutation rate in sporadic keratocystic odontogenic tumors.","pubmedId":"25458233"}
