In particular, certain subtypes harbor mutations similar to those observed in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which are sensitive to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\nThe purpose of this study was to characterize KIT gene mutations and patterns of protein expression in mucosal and acral melanoma.\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were retrieved from our archives. Histologic assessment included routine hematoxylin-eosin stains and immunohistochemical staining for KIT. Genomic DNA was used for polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of exons 11 and 13.\nWe identified 59 acral and mucosal melanoma cases, of which 78% showed variable levels of KIT expression. Sequencing of exons 11 and 13 was completed on all cases, and 4 (6.8%) mutant cases were isolated.\nWe successfully optimized conditions for the detection of KIT mutations and showed that 8.6% of mucosal and 4.2% of acral melanoma cases at our institution harbor KIT mutations; all mutant cases showed strong, diffuse KIT protein expression. Our case series represents the first Canadian study to characterize KIT gene mutations and patterns of protein expression in acral and mucosal melanoma.","title":"KIT gene mutations and patterns of protein expression in mucosal and acral melanoma.","pubmedId":"22513068"}
