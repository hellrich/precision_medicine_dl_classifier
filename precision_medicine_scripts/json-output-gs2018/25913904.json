The focus of this analysis was to investigate the associations among tumor characteristics, guideline adherence, and outcome and to compare these associations between younger breast cancer patients (yBCP) (age 50-69 years) and oBCP.\nThis is a retrospective multicenter cohort study with 17 participating certified breast cancer centers. The analysis of 10,897 patient records collected from 1992 to 2008 for GL+ and clinical outcome was performed. Tumor and patient characteristics and their associations with GL+ were compared between oBCP and yBCP.\nNonguideline-adherent treatment (GL-) was associated with higher tumor stages and comorbidities. This effect was stronger in the oBCP group (P \u003c .001). GL+ was significantly more common in yBCP than in oBCP (P \u003c .001). The oBCP had significantly higher tumor stages, including tumor size (P \u003c .001), nodal status (P \u003c .001), and positive hormone receptors (P \u003d .001). Tumor grading was lower (P \u003d .001), and HER2neu overexpression was less frequent (P \u003d .003) in oBCP. Overall survival and disease-free survival are significantly impaired if GL- occurred in patients with breast cancer independently of age.\nGL- is associated with decreased disease-free survival and overall survival in both age groups. GL+ decreases advanced tumor characteristics in all age groups but significantly more in oBCP. If patients received GL+, we were unable to detect a statistical significant difference in the survival parameters.","title":"Aggressive Intrinsic Subtypes in Breast Cancer: A Predictor of Guideline Adherence in Older Patients With Breast Cancer?","pubmedId":"25913904"}
