Previous studies have suggested that the clinicopathological differences observed between pediatric and adult PTC may be due the existence of distinct genetic alterations. However, the knowledge of genetic events in pediatric PTC is based primarily on studies in radiation-exposed PTC or in few studies that enrolled predominantly adolescent patients. The aim of this study was to characterize the known oncogenic alterations of the MAPK pathway found in adult and radiation-exposed PTCs in a cohort of predominantly sporadic pediatric PTC patients.\nThirty-five pediatric PTCs were screened for the most prevalent fusions (RET/PTC1, RET/PTC2, RET/PTC3, ETV6-NTRK3 and AGK-BRAF) and point mutations (BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61) described in sporadic pediatric PTC. The mutational status was correlated with clinicopathological data.\nMutations were found in 20 out of 35 (57%) PTC cases. Fusion oncogenes were the main genetic alterations found. RET/PTC1-3 rearrangements were found in 13 (37%), ETV6-NTRK3 in 3 (9%), AGK-BRAF in 4 (11%) and BRAF V600E in 3 (9%). No mutation was found in NRAS Q61. BRAF V600E was associated with older age and larger tumor size (P \u003c0.05) and RET/PTC3 was associated with a larger tumor size and multifocality (P \u003c0.05).\nThe genetic signature in this cohort was remarkably different than that observed in adults. Although observed at a lower prevalence, the spectrum of mutations was quite similar to that described in radiation-exposed pediatric PTC. As mutations were unidentifiable in over 40% of the PTC cases, more comprehensive studies conducted in these patients will help to decipher the genetic landscape of sporadic pediatric PTC.","title":"Fusion oncogenes are the main genetic events found in sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas from children.","pubmedId":"27849443"}
