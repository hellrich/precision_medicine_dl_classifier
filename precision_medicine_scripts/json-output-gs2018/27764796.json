Electronic databases were searched for eligible randomized trials that compared different strategies in efficacy and tolerability. Five interventions were associated with a significant improvement in PFS over chemotherapy (all HR \u003c 1): Ipilimumab, Tremelimumab, Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and Ipilimumab + Nivolumab. Three interventions exhibited significantly improved OS results over chemotherapy (all HR \u003c 1): Ipilimumab, Nivolumab and Ipilimumab + Chemotherapy. Four interventions were superior to chemotherapy in CR and PR (all OR \u003e 1): Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and Ipilimumab + Nivolumab. However, the other seven interventions were associated with an increased risk of pruritus compared to chemotherapy (all OR \u003e 1). Ipilimumab, Tremelimumab, Ipilimumab + Nivolumab and Ipilimumab + Chemotherapy might result in a higher risk of diarrhea compared to chemotherapy (all OR \u003e 1). Immune checkpoint therapy or combined interventions might be more effective than chemotherapy for managing melanoma patients. However, chemotherapy appears to be more tolerable than these combined strategies with respect to adverse events.","title":"Pharmacological interventions for melanoma: Comparative analysis using bayesian meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"27764796"}
