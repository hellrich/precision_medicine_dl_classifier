Prognosis is poor due to lack of effective comprehensive treatments. In this study, we assessed the expression of Gab1, VEGFR-2, and MMP-9 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma solid tumors by immunohistochemistry and determined whether their expression was associated with clinical and pathological features. We found that expression of Gab1, VEGFR-2, and MMP-9 was highly and positively correlated with each other and with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues. Interference of Gab1 and VEGFR-2 expression via siRNA in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell line RBE resulted in decreased PI3K/Akt pathway activity. Inhibition of Gab1 and VEGFR-2 expression also caused decreased cell proliferation, cell cycle arrested in G1 phase, increased apoptosis, and decreased invasion in RBE cells. These results suggest that Gab1, VEGFR-2, and MMP-9 contribute significantly to the highly malignant behavior of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The regulation of growth, apoptosis, and invasion by Gab1 through the VEGFR-2/Gab1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may represent potential targets for improving the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
