Isolated isochromosome 17q usually presents as a marker of a chronic myeloid disorder, with a high propensity for transformation into acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). t(4;12)(q11-12;p13) is a recently described translocation, associated with ANLL, predominantly in adults. In this article, we present a case of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) in a 14-year-old female in which i(17q) and t(4;12)(q12;p13) were found in the leukemic clone at diagnosis. We briefly review the literature and hypothesize as to the significance of the coexistence of these cytogenetic changes.","title":"Isochromosome (17)(q10) and translocation (4;12)(q12;p13) in a child with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"11734325"}
