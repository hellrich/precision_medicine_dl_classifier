In a subgroup of 56 tumours, the results of immunostaining with MAb 123C3--the antibody studied most extensively in our material--were compared to the ultrastructure, and in 231 radically resected non-small cell carcinomas, with histological tumour type and with clinical follow-up data. N-CAM expression was not limited to neuroendocrine tumours, as assessed ultrastructurally. Non-small cell lung carcinomas positive for MAb 123C3 showed post-operative overall and disease-free survival times significantly shorter than 123C3-negative non-small cell carcinomas.","title":"Neural cell adhesion molecule expression, neuroendocrine differentiation and prognosis in lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"1851619"}
