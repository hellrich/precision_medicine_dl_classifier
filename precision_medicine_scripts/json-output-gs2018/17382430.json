Among 1354 lung cancer cases diagnosed in Social Security Agency Okmeydani Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, we included 912 male cases with data on age, smoking status, and histopathologic type. We calculated the smoking-adjusted risk for histopathologic types by age. A majority of the cases were between 45 and 64 years of age (70.5%). The smoking-adjusted risk of squamous cell carcinoma increased with advancing age, while the risk of small cell carcinoma decreased with age. The risk of small cell carcinoma was 1.6 times higher among men younger than 45 years of age compared to older men (odds ratios (OR): 1.6, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.1-2.3). In conclusion, we found a significant decreasing trend for small cell carcinoma by increasing age, which resulted with an excess risk among men younger than age 45.","title":"The trend of small cell lung cancer among young men.","pubmedId":"17382430"}
