Therefore, providers who mainly treat older patients may become accustomed to not adhering to standards and thus might be less likely to provide standard care to younger patients. In this study, we compared the care provided to younger patients between facilities that care for a large number of elderly patients and those that treat relatively few older patients. Methods: We used a nationwide registry-linked claims database of 297 hospitals. Among the quality indicators (QIs) we formerly developed, we selected 2 and 3 QIs for lung cancer and gastric cancer, respectively, based on the variation in adherence across facilities. Facilities were divided into 2 groups based on the proportion of older patients (75) with each cancer type. We then compared the QI adherence in treating patients younger than 60 years old between the groups. The difference in adherence to standards of care (quality scores) between the 2 groups of facilities was assessed by using a logistic regression model adjusting for patient age and sex. Results: We analyzed data for 6,708 patients with lung cancer and 26,470 patients with gastric cancer. Respective quality scores for facilities with more older patients versus facilities with fewer older patients were 63.4% versus 66.1% (p\u003d0.439) for the EGFR mutation test before the first chemotherapy among stage IV lung adenocarcinoma patients; 63.2% versus 52.5% (p\u003d0.238) for concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for localized small cell lung carcinoma patients; 51.6% versus 46.9% (p\u003d0.229) for HER2 test before the first chemotherapy among patients with unresectable gastric cancer; 81.8% versus 79.7% (p\u003d0.354) for Helicobacter pylori test on patients with gastric cancer who had ESD/EMR; and 60.9% versus 60.7% (p\u003d0.948) for adjuvant chemotherapy within 6 weeks among pathological stage II/III gastric cancer patients. Conclusions: Caring for a high proportion of older patients is not associated with diminished provision of standard care to younger patients.","title":"Association between caring for a high proportion of older patients and adhering to standard care for younger patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_180036-198"}
