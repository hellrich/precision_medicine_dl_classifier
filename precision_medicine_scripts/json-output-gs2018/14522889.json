Mutations in the BRAF gene causing a V599E amino acid substitution that enhance the kinase activity have been described in \u003e60% of cutaneous melanomas and premalignant melanocytic lesions. We have investigated the frequency of BRAF mutations at the expression level in melanomas of the uveal tract. None of the 30 metastases and 10 primary uveal melanomas tested expressed the V599E mutation. In contrast, this mutation was expressed by 65% of cutaneous melanoma samples, confirming previous results. In addition, a double mutation resulting in V599K substitution was detected in two suspect ocular metastases of cutaneous melanoma. Analysis of exon 11, the second common site of BRAF mutations, revealed only wild-type sequences in uveal melanomas. Analysis of tumor lysates showed the presence of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase, kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase in 50% of uveal and 100% of cutaneous melanoma metastases. Taken together, these results suggest that although the common BRAF mutations found in cutaneous melanoma do not play a role in tumorigenesis of uveal tract melanocytes, activation of the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may nevertheless play an important role in uveal melanoma.","title":"Lack of BRAF mutations in uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"14522889"}
