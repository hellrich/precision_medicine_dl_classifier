We correlated the impact of FLT3 mutations and its expression with age, WHO 2008 classification and treatment outcome in 531 childhood acute leukaemias. Of 150 acute myeloid leukaemia (AMLs), 18 (12%) harboured FLT3-ITD while nine (6%) had FLT3-TKD. FLT3-ITD and -TKD were rare in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL; FLT3-ITD 0/26, FLT3-TKD 1/26) and children below 3 years (n \u003d 2/48). Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) with t(15;17);PML-RARα (n \u003d 7/18; 39%) harboured the highest frequency of FLT3 mutations, followed by myelomonocytic (n \u003d 4/18; 22%) and AML with t(8;21);RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (n \u003d 2/21; 9%). FLT3 expression levels were also lowest in AMKL, both in Down\u0027s and non-Down\u0027s (p \u003d 0.002) followed by patients \u003c3 years (p \u003d 0.001). The rarity of FLT3 mutations and expression levels in AMKL were independent of age. Conversely, only 2% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) harboured FLT3 mutations (ITD \u003d 1/381; TKD \u003d 6/381). FLT3 was highly expressed in hyperdiploid ALL (p \u003c 0.001). Of the 121 AMLs with clinical history, there were no significant differences in 4-year event-free survival (EFS) (46% vs. 38%; p \u003d 0.46) and overall-survival (OS) (55% vs. 43%; p \u003d 0.30) between FLT3-wildtype and ITD+ patients. Similarly, FLT3 expression levels did not influence survival in AML in both the good risk and non-good risk subgroups. FLT3 does not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of AMKL, both in Down\u0027s and non-Down\u0027s. Therapeutic targets using FLT3 inhibitors may not be useful in AMKL and in young children with AML.","title":"FLT3 mutation and expression did not adversely affect clinical outcome of childhood acute leukaemia: a study of 531 Southeast Asian children by the Ma-Spore study group.","pubmedId":"21387358"}
