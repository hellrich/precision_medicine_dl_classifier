In this study, our aim was to investigate the incidence of activating mutations of oncogenes BRAF, NRAS, KIT, and GNAQ/GNA11 in oral mucosal melanoma.\nWe analyzed a cohort of 57 oral mucosal melanoma samples, including 27 frozen samples and 30 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The tumors were screened for hotspot mutations of BRAF (exon 15), NRAS (exons 2 and 3), KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17), and GNAQ/GNA11 (exon 5) by high-resolution melting and direct sequencing.\nIn oral mucosal melanoma, 7.0% of tumors harbored KIT mutations and 3.5% harbored BRAF mutations, while classic BRAF V600E mutation was not detected. We found no mutations of NRAS or GNAQ/GNA11 in oral mucosal melanoma.\nWe demonstrated that driver mutations are rare in mutational hotspots of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, and GNAQ/GNA11 in oral mucosal melanoma. The majority of patients will not benefit from KIT and BRAF inhibitors.","title":"Mutation scanning of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, and GNAQ/GNA11 in oral mucosal melanoma: a study of 57 cases.","pubmedId":"26399561"}
