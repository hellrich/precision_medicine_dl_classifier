White adipose tissues from several anatomical locations were dissected. Serum parameters were analyzed by using commercial kits. The activities of fatty acid synthase and heparin-releasable lipoprotein lipase (HR-LPL) were measured using spectrophotometric and fluorimetric methods, and protein expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adipose tissue triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) by western blot.\nThe administration of either resveratrol or quercetin separately did not induce significant reductions in adipose tissue weights. By contrast, the combination of both molecules led to a significant reduction in all the fat depots analyzed. The percentage of reduction in each tissue was greater than the calculated additive effect. HR-LPL activity was reduced in RSV and RSV + Q groups. The activity of HSL was not modified. By contrast, ACC was inhibited and ATGL increased only by the combination of both polyphenols.\nThe results obtained demonstrate a synergistic effect between resveratrol and quercetin and suggest that when these molecules are combined, a great number of metabolic pathways involved in adipose tissue triacylglycerol accumulation are affected.","title":"The combination of resveratrol and quercetin enhances the individual effects of these molecules on triacylglycerol metabolism in white adipose tissue.","pubmedId":"25669932"}
