The overall mean patient age and male-to-female ratio were 42 +/- 17 years and 1.56 respectively. The most common forms of skin cancers observed were Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma in 103 cases (46.2%), skin carcinoma in 75 cases (33.6%), melanoma in 23 cases (10.3%), and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans in 16 cases (7.2%). In the Kaposi\u0027s syndrome group, the average age and male-to-female ratio were 39 +/- 15 years and 2.68 respectively and the main location was the lower limbs (77.9%). In the cutaneous carcinoma group, 64 cases involved squamous cell carcinoma with an average age and male-to-female ratio of 48 +/- 17 years and 1.29 respectively. In 18 cases squamous cell carcinoma developed on chronic leg ulcer. In the melanoma group, the average age and male-to-female ratio were 55 +/- 16 years and 0.64 respectively and the main location was the distal extremities. In the dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans group, the average age and male-to-female ratio were 45 +/- 20 years and 0.78 respectively. The other types of skin cancers observed were mycosis fongoides in 4 cases (1.8%) and Paget\u0027s disease in 2.\nThis study showed that Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma was the most frequent skin cancer in Togo in conjunction with the current HIV infection epidemic. Findings also indicated that the incidence of other types of skin cancers was relatively stable.","title":"[Skin cancers in Togo: a 223-case series].","pubmedId":"20486355"}
