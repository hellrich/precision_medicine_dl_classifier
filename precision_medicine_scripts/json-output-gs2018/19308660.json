However, several clinical characteristics including male predominance, frequent lymphadenopathy and unfavorable outcome have been identified. Recurrence of monosomies 7p and/or 12p in T/myeloid biphenotypic acute leukemia has been reported. We treated a patient with T/myeloid biphenotypic acute leukemia showing clonal chromosomal and genetic abnormalities including dic(7;12)(p11;p11) and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication. Cytogenetic analysis of both bone marrow and lymph node cells disclosed that the patient\u0027s lymph node leukemia cells had chromosomal abnormalities in addition to dic(7;12). Our findings suggest that the leukemia cells of systemic lymphadenopathy had evolved as secondary cells from marrow leukemia cells. The patient was successfully treated with induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","title":"Monosomies 7p and 12p and FLT3 internal tandem duplication: possible markers for diagnosis of T/myeloid biphenotypic acute leukemia and its clonal evolution.","pubmedId":"19308660"}
