Other occasional treatment had comprised the topical administration of glucocorticosteroids, dithranol or tar. In 1989, on the upper part of the patient\u0027s back a newly developed pigmented skin lesion was excised under the clinical diagnosis of a pigmented, dysplastic nevus. Histological examination revealed a superficial spreading malignant melanoma (0.4 mm thick, Clark level II). In this case, exposure to high cumulative doses of therapeutic UV irradiation might have played an etiological role for the development of malignant melanoma.","title":"Malignant melanoma in association with phototherapy.","pubmedId":"1558997"}
