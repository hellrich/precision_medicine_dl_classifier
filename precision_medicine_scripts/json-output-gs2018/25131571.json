Metastases to the oral cavity are a rare occurrence that can arise from lung cancers. This case report describes the presentation of a metastatic lesion from a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma on the mandibular buccal alveolar attached gingivae. The inpatient had terminal disease with known pleural, brain and liver metastases and was receiving palliative care at the time of diagnosis of the oral lesion.
