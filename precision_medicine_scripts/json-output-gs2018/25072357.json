The development of evasion mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment may be responsible for poor therapeutic responses. In this manuscript, we report that the 15-deoxy-δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) activator leads to the downregulation of the cancer-associated expression of B7-H1 in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and the associated signaling cascades.\nThe expression of B7-H1 from IFN-γ-induced B16F10 melanoma cells was measured with flow cytometric analysis. The regulatory mechanisms of 15d-PGJ2 on cellular signaling pathways were examined using Western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.\nThe flow cytometric analysis revealed that the B7-H1 costimulatory molecule is significantly upregulated in B16F10 melanoma cells by stimulation with IFN-γ. However, 15d-PGJ2 strongly downregulates B7-H1 expression in IFN-γ-stimulated B16F10 melanoma cells. Furthermore, the significant damping effect of 15d-PGJ2 on B7-H1 expression involves the inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase (Jak) and signal transducer(s) and activator(s) of transcription (STAT) and, thereby, the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) trans-activation of STAT. These effects of 15d-PGJ2 were not abrogated by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662, indicating that they occur through a PPARγ-independent mechanism.\nIn this study, we demonstrate that 15d-PGJ2 suppresses the IFN-γ-elicited expression of B7-H1 by the inhibition of IRF-1 transcription via the Jak/STAT signaling pathway through a PPARγ-independent mechanism in mouse melanoma cells.","title":"Attenuation of IFN-γ-induced B7-H1 expression by 15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 via downregulation of the Jak/STAT/IRF-1 signaling pathway.","pubmedId":"25072357"}
