TRK oncogenes are frequently detected in human papillary thyroid carcinoma, as result of rearrangements involving at least three different activating genes. We have found that the rearrangements creating all the TRK oncogenes so far characterized fall within a 2.9-kb XbaI/SmaI restriction fragment of the NTRK1 gene. Here we report the nucleotide sequence and the exon organization of this fragment.","title":"Characterization of the NTRK1 genomic region involved in chromosomal rearrangements generating TRK oncogenes.","pubmedId":"8288244"}
