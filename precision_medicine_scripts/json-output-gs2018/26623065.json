The clinical data of 16 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients, aged \u003e70 years, who were initially treated with nimotuzumab combined with RT, were collected and retrospectively reviewed. The overall response and treatment toxicity were analyzed using SPSS software. All the patients completed the treatment schedule. The response to treatment was assessed at treatment completion and reassessed after 1-2 months: 1 patient achieved complete response (CR), 10 patients achieved partial response (PR), 4 patients exhibited stable disease and 1 patient developed disease progression and succumbed to radiation pneumonitis (RP) 1 month later. The overall response rate (CR+PR) was 68.8%. All 16 patients experienced grade 1-2 radiation esophagitis; no grade 3-4 toxicities were reported. There was one case of treatment-related mortality due to RP during the study. One patient developed a rash on the forearm. No hematological, gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal toxicities were observed. In conclusion, the toxicity of combined nimotuzumab with RT in elderly patients with esophageal cancer was tolerable. However, due to limitations associated with the retrospective nature of this study, the limited number of enrolled cases and the epidermal growth factor receptor expression determination prior to treatment, the efficacy of this treatment modality requires further investigation.","title":"Efficacy and toxicity of nimotuzumab combined with radiotherapy in elderly patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26623065"}
