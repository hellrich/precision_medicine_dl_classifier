A decrease after surgery of EGFR ECD correlated with a statistically significant lower DFS; each 1 ng/ml decrease in EGFR ECD serum level was associated with an increase of event risk of 15% on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 1.15 95% confidence interval 1.04.-1.28, p\u003d0.006).\nThe perioperative absolute change of EGFR ECD significantly correlated with disease outcome of patients with early breast cancer. No correlation was found between preoperative and perioperative absolute change of serum VEGF and HER2 ECD.","title":"Perioperative serum VEGF and extracellular domains of EGFR and HER2 in early breast cancer.","pubmedId":"20044624"}
