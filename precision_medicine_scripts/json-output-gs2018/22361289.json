New technologies are being evaluated to bypass the skin biopsy in the detection of melanoma. The quest for reliable biomarkers, with respect to subclinical detection, prognosis, and predicting treatment response, is longstanding and ongoing. New therapies have been developed for metastatic disease, including targeted small molecule inhibitors as well as immune modulators.","title":"Malignant melanoma: advances in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.","pubmedId":"22361289"}
