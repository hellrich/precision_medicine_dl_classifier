Together with PD-L1 expression, the BRAF(V600E) mutation is one of the optimal therapeutic targets for the treatment of melanoma. In this report, we describe a case of multifocal melanoma in situ on the foot, which carried the p.V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. Interestingly, the spotted melanoma lesion is demarcated by normal skin, and in all spotted pigmented lesions, there were no signs of dermal invasion of melanoma cells or spontaneous regression. Our case presented atypical clinical features, which might correlate with the local mutations of BRAF gene and the immunological expression of PD-L1.
