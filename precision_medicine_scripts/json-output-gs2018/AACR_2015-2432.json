Synchronous treatment of patients and mice showed that PDX responses mirrored those of the patients tumor to BRAF inhibitors. PDXs were used to test second-line treatments in relapsed patients and to validate WES-based therapies in tumors that did not have a BRAF mutation. Longitudinal analysis of ctDNA was predictive of responses to targeted and immunotherapies, and to determine mechanisms of resistance. Thus, we describe a powerful combination of techniques for personalized medicine in melanoma and discuss the challenges and limitations of implementing these novel technologies in patient management.","title":"A technology platform for personalized medicine in melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2432"}
