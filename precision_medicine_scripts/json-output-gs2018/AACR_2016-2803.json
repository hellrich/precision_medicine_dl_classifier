Although multiple mechanisms are involved in cisplatin efficacy, the most prominent and best understood modes of action are the generation of DNA lesions and induction of apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent effects on mitochondrial integrity. However, intrinsic or acquired cisplatin resistance can become a limiting factor in cisplatin-based therapy. Evofosfamide is a hypoxia-activated prodrug that is reduced at its nitroimidazole group and preferentially under hypoxic conditions releases Br-IPM, a DNA cross-linker. Evofosfamide is currently being investigated in multiple clinical trials for the treatment of cancer including indications and settings where resistance to cisplatin is observed (e.g. second-line non-small cell lung cancer; NCT01403610). We have previously demonstrated both shared and distinct DNA repair pathways involved with evofosfamide and cisplatin DNA damage. In the current study, we have conducted comparative studies to identify any distinctions in the relative role of ROS underlying cell sensitivity to cisplatin and evofosfamide to help evaluate the potential of evofosfamide to treat cisplatin-resistant tumors. The cisplatin-sensitive cervical cancer cell line ME180, the intermediate cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3, and cisplatin-resistant human lung cancer cell line A549 were investigated with respect to their chemosensitivity to evofosfamide. Unlike cisplatin, evofosfamide exhibited similar potency across all three cell lines. Addition of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) reduced the potency of cisplatin- but not evofosfamide-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating ROS plays a role in cytotoxicity mediated by cisplatin, but not evofosfamide. ROS levels were investigated using the dye H2DCFDA. Cisplatin induced a concentration-dependent and NAC-inhibitable increase of cellular ROS in cisplatin-sensitive ME-180 cells but not in cisplatin-resistant A549 cells. In contrast, ROS levels were not affected by the addition of evofosfamide under normoxia and hypoxia in both ME180 and A549 cells. In order to ascertain whether mitochondrial pathway-mediated apoptosis was involved in cytotoxicity mediated by evofosfamide and cisplatin, mitochondrial membrane depolarization was investigated with the dye JC-1. Cisplatin induced a concentration-dependent JC-1 polarization and these effects were abolished by NAC. In contrast, evofosfamide did not affect mitochondrial membrane potential. In conclusion, this data demonstrates that ROS is an essential factor in cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity, but not in evofosfamide-mediated cytotoxicity.","title":"Distinct roles of intracellular ROS in cisplatin and evofosfamide cytotoxicity","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2803"}
