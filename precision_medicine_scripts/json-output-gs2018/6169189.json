No argyrophilic cells were found in the normal breast tissue or in the benign lesions studied. In three of the carcinomas (3.3%) such granules were found in the tumor cells. Using electron microscopy, the argyrophilic granules were shown to be of moderate or high electron density with an average diameter of 165 to 170 nm. Ectopic hormone production was not observed clinically in any of these three patients. The absence of argyrophilic cells in normal and benign ductal and acinar epithelium, and their occasional presence in breast carcinomas favors the concept of the histogenesis of these cells through genomic derepression during the course of neoplastic transformation.","title":"Argyrophilic cells in carcinoma of the female breast.","pubmedId":"6169189"}
