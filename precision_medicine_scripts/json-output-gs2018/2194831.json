Comparison involved mRNA expression in normal and malignant breast tissues as well as in non-breast tumors. Results obtained by RNA dot blot and Northern hybridizations showed that expression of the H23 antigen coding gene is a discriminatory marker in human breast cancer. It is expressed in 92% of breast tumors whereas 69%, 62% and 56% of breast tumors demonstrate significant mRNA levels of c-erbB2, ER and pS2, respectively. Non-malignant or normal breast tissue expresses much lower levels of the H23 antigen mRNA. From the comparative analysis presented here it is concluded that the gene coding for H23 antigen furnishes a most useful marker for human breast cancer.","title":"Expression of genes coding for pS2, c-erbB2, estrogen receptor and the H23 breast tumor-associated antigen.
