They are crucial factors for the development and maintenance of epithelial architecture. Aberrantly expressed cadherins are known to be involved in malignant transformation of different types of tissues. In a previous study, we determined the expression of a short truncated 50 kDa form of P-cadherin only consisting of the N-terminal part in malignant melanoma. Further analysis revealed that this short 50 kDa form of P-cadherin representing the N-terminal, extracellular region, is secreted by melanoma cells in contrast to the membrane bound form in melanocytes. In order to define the functional relevance of expression of the 50 kDa P-cadherin variant in malignant melanoma, antisense P-cadherin cell clones were generated. The clones in which P-cadherin expression is reduced show no changes in proliferation or in attachment-independent growth when compared to controls. However, a strong reduction of migratory and invasive properties was observed in these cells, suggesting that truncated P-cadherin promotes melanoma cell invasion and migration and therefore has an important role in the progression of malignant melanoma. Functionally, the secreted form of P-cadherin could play a role as regulator of the homophilic interaction between P-cadherin molecules by antagonizing their biological role acting as a dominant negative form to interrupt cell-cell attachment.","title":"Functional implication of truncated P-cadherin expression in malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"16919267"}
