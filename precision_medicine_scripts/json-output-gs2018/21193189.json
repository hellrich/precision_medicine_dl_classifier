He had been diagnosed with oligospermia 5 years before.\nDiscontinuation of finasteride.\nImprovement of semen parameters.\nAfter cessation of finasteride, the patient\u0027s semen volume increased immediately, and sperm concentration was up to more than 10 Ã— 10(6)/mL 16 weeks after stopping finasteride. He is now trying to achieve pregnancy by intrauterine insemination.\nCessation of finasteride improved spermatogenesis and allowed the couple to attempt less-invasive fertility therapy. In this case, the patient had impaired spermatogenesis before he started the drug. In such patients, the drug may further decrease spermatogenesis. We suggest that drug cessation could be taken into consideration for infertile male patients with impaired semen parameters who are taking finasteride at a 1-mg dose.","title":"Finasteride-associated male infertility.","pubmedId":"21193189"}
