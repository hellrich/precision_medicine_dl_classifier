The data were analyzed using SPSS 11.0 software package.\nFGFR1-positive chondrocytes were abundant in the maturative layer and hypertrophic layer, but only few FGFR1-positive chondrocytes were found in the proliferative layer. In the control group, the expression of FGFR1 increased from 6-week-old to 10-week-old rats, and then decreased and went stable. In both young and adult group, the expression of FGFR1 in the experimental group was significantly lower at 4, 6 weeks and higher at 8 weeks than that in the control group, especially in the young group(P\u003c0.05). But no difference was found between the experimental group and the control group at 2 weeks in both groups.\nFGFR1 may play an important role in the remodling of condylar cartilage induced by occlusal disorders.","title":"[Effect of gradually induced occlusal disorders on the expression of FGFR1 of the condylar cartilage in rats].","pubmedId":"17660911"}
