EGFR gene amplification was examined by slot-blot hybridization using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. EGFR expression was also examined immunohistochemically using the same tissues with a monoclonal antibody that is monospecific for EGFR. In 5 of 103 cases (4.9%), a 2- to 11-fold amplification of EGFR gene was detected. Four of these 5 cases were poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. All of them had overexpressions of EGFR. The cumulative survival rate of patients with EGFR gene amplification was significantly lower than that of the patients without amplification (p \u003c 0.05) and all of them died within 3 years. Except for tumor size (p \u003c 0.03), there were no significant clinicopathologic differences between the two groups. On the other hand, 41 of 103 cases (39.8%) exhibited expression of EGFR. However, there was no significant correlation between EGFR expression and clinicopathologic factors or prognosis. These results indicate that EGFR gene amplification may occur in advanced stages during the progression and be an important indicator of poor short-term prognosis in gastric carcinoma.","title":"Amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor gene and its relationship to survival in human gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"7715901"}
