Most patients with thyroid cancer have a great chance for successful treating. There is, however, a group of patients with poor prognosis. The present researches of thyroid tumor markers have related to permanent diagnostic progress of circulating markers analysis (thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen), cellular markers determination and interpretation of results, also. A number of molecular markers have been studied. Diagnostic value of some of them, e.g. TSHR, RET Ras, is well known. Others have investigated continually. Overexpression of BRAF, Met, and p53 has been correlated with aggressiveness of the cancer. Markers said to be of prognostic value in thyroid cancer are CD82, c- myc and Plk-1. The combination of markers: galectin-3, fibronectin and HBME-1 have proven to be sensitive for differentiated thyroid cancer. Further studies on new cellular thyroid markers are essential. The current review presents data concerning the well known cellular markers in thyroid cancer.","title":"[Cellular tumor markers in thyroid cancer].","pubmedId":"17684930"}
