This genetic duet was indicated to be involved in the aggressiveness of PTC, but its prognostic value in PTC-related mortality remains to be specifically established.\nTo establish the prognostic power of this genetic duet in PTC-specific mortality.\nThis genetic-clinical correlation study examined BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations (chr5:1,295,228C\u003eT and chr5:1,295,250C\u003eT) and PTC-specific mortality in 1051 patients (764 women and 287 men) with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 46 (36-57) years, with a median (IQR) follow-up time of 89 (48-142) months (7.4 years).\nBRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutation patterns and associated patient deaths caused by PTC.\nPapillary thyroid cancer-specific mortality occurred in 4 of 629 patients (0.6%) with neither mutation; 7 of 292 (2.4%) with BRAF V600E alone; 4 of 64 (6.3%) with TERT promoter mutation alone; and 15 of 66 (22.7%) with the genetic duet; and deaths per 1000-person years in patients harboring neither mutation, BRAF V600E alone, TERT mutation alone, or both mutations were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.30-2.13), 3.08 (95% CI, 1.47-6.46), 6.62 (95% CI, 2.48-17.64), and 29.86 (95% CI, 18.00-49.52), respectively. Compared with patients harboring neither mutation, HRs (95% CIs) for PTC-specific mortality were 3.08 (0.87-10.84) for BRAF V600E alone; 8.18 (2.04-32.75) with TERT mutation alone; and 37.77 (12.50-114.09) with both mutations. Papillary thyroid cancer-specific mortality for cases with both mutations remained significant (HR, 9.34; 95% CI, 2.53-34.48) after adjustment for clinicopathological factors, and the genetic duet showed a strong incremental and synergistic impact over either mutation alone. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed a flat PTC-specific patient survival curve with neither mutation, a modest decline in the curve with either mutation alone, and a sharp decline in the curve with coexisting mutations. Even more robust mortality associations of the genetic duet were seen when only conventional-variant PTC (CPTC) was analyzed (HR, 54.46; 95% CI, 12.26-241.82), which remained strongly significant (HR, 18.56; 95% CI, 2.97-116.18) after adjustment for clinicopathological factors.\nThese results demonstrate a simple 4-genotype classification of PTC, particularly CPTC, with a disease-specific mortality risk order of the genetic duet\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003eBRAF V600E alone \u003d TERT promoter mutation alone \u003e wild-type for both genes, representing a powerful molecular prognostic system that can help pinpoint patients with the highest mortality risk.","title":"Mortality Risk Stratification by Combining BRAF V600E and TERT Promoter Mutations in Papillary Thyroid Cancer: Genetic Duet of BRAF and TERT Promoter Mutations in Thyroid Cancer Mortality.","pubmedId":"27581851"}
