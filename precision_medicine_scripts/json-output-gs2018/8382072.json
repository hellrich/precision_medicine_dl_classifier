Of 53 evaluable patients, 47 achieved clinical responses (9 complete response, 38 partial response) after induction therapy for a response rate of 89%. 47 patients were resectable after induction therapy, but 8 patients refused surgery and 6 patients were not eligible for surgery based on poor pulmonary function (medical contraindications). 33 patients underwent thoracotomy and in 6 patients, resection was technically unfeasible. Thus complete surgical resection was accomplished in 27 patients. After all therapy, 28 patients achieved a complete response (53%) and 19 patients a partial response (36%). Toxicities were mild. At a maximum of 75 months (median, 28 months) of follow-up, the median survival of the entire group is 24 months. The median survival of resected patients has not been reached; their 6-year survival rate is 55%. Unresected patients survived for a median of 11 months. This multimodality regimen is well-tolerated, induces a high response and resectability rate and prolongs survival in resected patients.","title":"Combined modality therapy for stage IIIA non-small cell carcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"8382072"}
