Reported herein are the most current National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) data for melanoma.\nTwo calls for data have yielded 20,165 melanoma cases for 1985, 1988, and 1990 from hospital cancer registries across the country.\nThere was a marked increase in Stage 0 (in situ) tumors between 1985 and 1990. NCDB data confirm a trend for more conservative surgical excision of skin melanoma. Use of multimodality therapy was infrequent.\nSurvival data confirmed an excellent correlation between stage of disease and outcome. Early skin melanoma is highly curable.","title":"The National Cancer Data Base. Report on melanoma.","pubmedId":"8033061"}
