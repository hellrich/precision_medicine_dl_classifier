The quantity of cell-free methylated p16(INK4a) DNA in the plasma samples of 200 patients with invasive breast cancer was also examined using a fluorescence-based real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.\nThe frequencies of p16(INK4a) methylation in invasive and intraductal tumors were 52.8% (122/231) and 57.8% (52/90), respectively. The p16 protein was overexpressed in 145 of the 231 invasive carcinomas (62.8%) and 63 of the 90 intraductal carcinomas (70%). High p16 expression in invasive carcinomas correlated significantly with a high histologic grade, a negative estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status, p53 immunoreactivity and high Ki-67 expression with immunohistochemistry. In addition, the methylation index of p16(INK4a) was significantly higher in the cancer patients than the normal controls (p\u003c0.001).\nHigh p16 immunoreactivity correlated with a loss of differentiation in breast carcinomas and high frequency of p16(INK4a) promoter methylation in both invasive and intraductal carcinomas, suggesting it may be involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.","title":"Methylation and Immunoexpression of p16(INK4a) Tumor Suppressor Gene in Primary Breast Cancer Tissue and Their Quantitative p16(INK4a) Hypermethylation in Plasma by Real-Time PCR.","pubmedId":"23323106"}
