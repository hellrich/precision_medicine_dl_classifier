Examination revealed epiretinal membrane in the right eye without posterior vitreous separation or vitreous abnormality and bilateral myelinated nerve fiber layer. Subsequent workup yielded pathologic diagnosis of multiple skin basal cell carcinoma and odontogenic keratocysts in the jaw. Genetic testing revealed a frameshift mutation in the PTCH1 gene.\nBasal cell nevus syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disease that affects multiple organ systems, including the eyes. Recognition of common ocular findings in children with basal cell nevus syndrome can lead to systemic diagnosis. Early diagnosis is critical to initiate early screening for known neoplastic associations and lifelong minimization of sun exposure to reduce the incidence and severity of basal cell carcinoma.","title":"BASAL CELL NEVUS SYNDROME PRESENTING AS EPIRETINAL MEMBRANE AND MYELINATED NERVE FIBER LAYER.","pubmedId":"27533646"}
