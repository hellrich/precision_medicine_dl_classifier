However, many survivors report significant sexual dysfunction after treatment that may adversely affect their quality of life in survivorship.\nThis article examines studies investigating sexual function in men and women treated for colorectal cancer. Also included are data on the prevalence and nature of sexual dysfunctions in colorectal cancer survivors, the impact of specific treatment modalities for colorectal cancer on sexual function, and the management of sexual dysfunction in men and women.\nPublished studies investigating sexual dysfunction after colorectal cancer treatment generally have been limited conceptually and methodologically. However, findings suggest that the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among colorectal cancer survivors is high.\nSexual dysfunction is often a long-term and late effect of treatment for colorectal cancer. The assessment and management of sexual dysfunction in men and women treated for colorectal cancer should be standard practice throughout treatment and in survivorship.","title":"Sexual function in colorectal cancer survivors.","pubmedId":"20010518"}
