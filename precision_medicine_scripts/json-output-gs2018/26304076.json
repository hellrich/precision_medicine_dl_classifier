Meanwhile, Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to analyze the risk factors for disease progression.\nAt 3 months after imatinib treatment BCR-ABL transcriptional levels\u003e10%, \u003e1%-≤ 10% and ≤ 1% were found in 92, 94 and 64 patients, their PFS were 53.3%, 71.3% and 86.2%, respectively. The results showed that the PFS of patients with low BCR-ABL transcriptional levels was significantly superior to that with high BCR-ABL transcriptional levels for CML at 3 months treatment (P\u003c0.05). The OS of three group did not reach statistical significance (92.4% vs 96.8% vs 93.8%, P\u003e 0.05). When 182 patients received imatinib treatment at 6 months, 22 patients with BCR-ABL transcriptional levels\u003e10%, 50\u003e1% -≤ 10% and 110 ≤ 1%, their PFS were 27.3% vs 66.0% vs 82.7% (P\u003c0.05), the OS of three groups were 86.4% vs 94.0% vs 100%. There were significant differences among the three groups (P\u003c0.05). Logistic regression confirmed that the level of BCR-ABL transcriptional level at 3 and 6 months after imatinib treatment was independent factor to influence the progress of disease.\nIt is important for the prognosis evaluation of CML patients to monitor BCR-ABL transcriptional level at 3 and 6 months after imatinib treatment.","title":"[The prognostic value of early BCR-ABL transcripts level in 251 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia after treatment with imatinib].","pubmedId":"26304076"}
