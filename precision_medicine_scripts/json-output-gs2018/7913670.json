The analysis showed that proteins of c-jun and c-myc were expressed in a significantly higher frequency in metastases than in primary lung tumors. Gross differences were not found between primary tumors and metastatic tumors with regard to the expression of c-erbB1, c-erbB2 and c-fos. The finding of cases with a higher expression of c-jun and c-myc in lymph nodes suggests that metastatic capability may be higher in certain cell populations.","title":"Analysis of c-fos, c-jun, c-erbB1, c-erbB2 and c-myc in primary lung carcinomas and their lymph node metastases.","pubmedId":"7913670"}
