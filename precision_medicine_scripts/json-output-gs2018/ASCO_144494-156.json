Oncogenic fusions of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1)receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) define 2 distinct subsets of NSCLC patients (pts) and play essential roles in tumor cell survival, growth, and metastasis. While most biomarker-selected pts derive some clinical benefit from initial treatment with a TKI, most will eventually develop resistance. PF-06463922 is a selective TKI of ALK and ROS1 that preclinically demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of mutations that confer resistance to treatment with other TKIs. As the central nervous system (CNS) is a common site of metastases in these pts and PF-06463922 is a brain-penetrant compound, it is hypothesized that PF-06463922 will also be active in pts with CNS metastases.  Methods:  This ongoing, single-arm, phase I/II trial (NCT01970865) is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of PF-06463922 in pts with advanced ALK+ or ROS1+ NSCLC with or without CNS metastases. In all, 22 pts have been enrolled in Phase I and, thus far, PF-06463922 has demonstrated clinical activity in ALK+ and ROS1+ NSCLC pts, most of whom had CNS metastases and had received at least 1 prior TKI. Phase II was designed to assess efficacy across 4 distinct populations: ALK+ pts who are treatment-nave, ALK+ pts with progression after crizotinib, ALK+ pts with progression after 1 or 2 prior TKI, and ROS1+ pts in any line of treatment. All pts must have at least 1 measurable extracranial lesion by RECIST v1.1. Pts with asymptomatic CNS metastases, leptomeningeal disease, or carcinomatous meningitis are eligible. The starting dose for phase II will be identified in phase I. Correlative biomarker studies on blood and tumor tissue (archival tissue and de novo biopsies) will be performed. Five of the 75 planned sites are open and recruiting. For more information, visit ClinicalTrials.gov or contact Pfizer Oncology at 1-800-718-1021.
