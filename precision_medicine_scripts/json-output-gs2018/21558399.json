Tumor specimens were analyzed for EGFR and KRAS mutations and EGFR protein expression and amplification. Patients with 25% or more reduction in tumor size measured bidimensionally at 3 weeks and/or patients with an EGFR mutation received adjuvant gefitinib for 2 years postoperatively.\nFifty patients with stage I/II NSCLC were treated. After 21 days of preoperative gefitinib a response of 25% or more was observed in 21 of 50 (42%) patients. Seventeen of 21 patients with a response had an EGFR mutation and 4 of 21 patients with a response did not (P \u003d 0.0001). Twenty-five of 50 patients were eligible to receive adjuvant gefitinib. With a median follow-up of 44.1 months, 2-year disease free survival for EGFR mutant patients and for those who received adjuvant gefitinib was not statistically different than those who were EGFR wild-type and those who did not receive adjuvant gefitinib. The median disease free and overall survivals have not been reached.\nThe presence of sensitizing EGFR mutations correlates with radiographic response. A short course of preoperative treatment serves a platform for evaluating activity of new agents and assures sufficient tumor availability for correlative analyses.","title":"Molecular characteristics predict clinical outcomes: prospective trial correlating response to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib with the presence of sensitizing mutations in the tyrosine binding domain of the EGFR gene.","pubmedId":"21558399"}
