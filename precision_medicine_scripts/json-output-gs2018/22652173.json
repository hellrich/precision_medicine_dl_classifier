Modulation of WNT signaling alters the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition activators, suggesting a role of this process in the regulation of glioma motility. Using immunohistochemistry in patient-derived glioblastoma samples we showed higher numbers of cells with intranuclear signal for β-catenin in the infiltrating edge of tumor compared to central tumor parenchyma. These findings suggest that canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is a critical regulator of GBM invasion and may represent a potential therapeutic target.","title":"Activation of canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling enhances in vitro motility of glioblastoma cells by activation of ZEB1 and other activators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.","pubmedId":"22652173"}
