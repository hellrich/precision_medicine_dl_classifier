Specifically, advancement in our knowledge of alterations in signal transduction pathways in melanoma has led to the rapid development of a number of pharmacologic agents that inhibit these pathways. This review will discuss changes in signal transduction pathways involved in melanoma, specifically, activated mitogen-activated protein kinase, activated PI3 kinase, and inactivated p53/Rb pathways. This article will also review new targeted therapy in the context of the molecular biology of melanoma.","title":"Novel targeted therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"21603366"}
