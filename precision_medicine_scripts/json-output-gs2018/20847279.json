Since IDH1 mutations have been associated with better clinical outcome, they are suitable predictive markers for adult glioma patients. We have developed a pyrosequencing assay that allows both the sensitive and rapid detection of mutant IDH1 alleles in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. PCR products that span exon 4 of IDH1 were used as a template for pyrosequencing. For validation, PCR products were additionally cloned and sequenced conventionally by Sanger sequencing. Sensitivity was measured by titration of wild-type and mutant sequences. PCR kinetic experiments were performed to investigate the influences of PCR cycle number on the accuracy of the assay. We found that a minimum of 5% of mutant IDH1 alleles can easily be detected with the pyrosequencing approach. So far, there are few data regarding IDH1 mutation status in high-grade gliomas of childhood. Therefore, we applied this assay to 47 pediatric high-grade glioma samples (age range 6 weeks to 23 years). Mutations were found in 5/14 astrocytoma III and in 6/33 glioblastomas. In conclusion, we have developed a pyrosequencing-based assay for the detection of mutations at the hotspot regions of IDH1 and provide proof for its applicability as a molecular diagnostic assay for clinical samples.","title":"A pyrosequencing-based assay for the rapid detection of IDH1 mutations in clinical samples.","pubmedId":"20847279"}
