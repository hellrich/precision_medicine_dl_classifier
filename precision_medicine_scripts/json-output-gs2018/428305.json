Five months later he presented with secondary biliary cirrhosis and signs of portal hypertension and hepatocellular failure. At autopsy, a squamous cell carcinoma of the bile duct was found. This case represents an unusually rapid development of cirrhosis secondary to extrahepatic biliary obstruction with documentation of normal liver histology five months prior to his last admission.","title":"Rapid development of cirrhosis secondary to squamous cell carcinoma of the common bile duct.","pubmedId":"428305"}
