But, almost all patients of EGFR-mutant lung cancers develop drug resistance to these agents. This paper reported a case of a 49-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma who had EGFR mutant (19-DEL) treated with EGFR-TKIs. After disease progression, histological examination of a secondary biopsy specimen revealed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) had transformed to SCLC treatment. Through the analysis of the process and effect of her therapy, the following is a summary of the relevant mechanism. \n近年来，非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）静脉化疗逐渐进入平台期，缓解率（response rate, RR）、平均总生存期（overall survival, OS）无明显改善；随着分子生物学发展，以表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）为靶点的EGFR酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, EGFR-TKIs）在NSCLC的治疗中疗效显著，但患者最终均会出现耐药，关于耐药机制目前尚未完全明确。本文详细报道1例49岁女性EGFR基因19外显子缺失突变肺腺癌患者，在靶向治疗耐药后二次活检发现转化为小细胞肺癌（small cell lung cancer, SCLC），予以SCLC化疗方案两周期有效；通过分析患者诊疗过程、疗效，对相关机制进展作一综述。.","title":"[Clinical Observation of Translating to Small Cell Lung Cancer Following Treatment with EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Lung Adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"26483340"}
