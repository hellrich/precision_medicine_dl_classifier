Response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival were analyzed according to histological subtype, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and metastatic site.\nCommon histological subtypes included leiomyosarcoma (n \u003d 9), angiosarcoma (n \u003d 6), malignant fibrous histiocytoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (MFH/UPS, n \u003d 5), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST, n \u003d 5), and synovial sarcoma (n \u003d 4). Nineteen patients (44.2%) received more than two chemotherapy regimens before pazopanib. At the time of analysis, 208 treatment cycles of pazopanib had been administered (median, 4.8 cycles per patient), and no treatment-related mortality occurred. The disease control rate was 61.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46.1-75.9%), and the overall response rate was 17.1% (partial response, n \u003d 7; complete response, n \u003d 0). Partial response was achieved in two patients with synovial sarcoma, two with MFH/UPS, one with MPNST, one with leiomyosarcoma, and one with angiosarcoma. The median lengths of progression-free survival and overall survival were 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.6-6.4 months) and 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.8-10.6 months), respectively. Progression-free survival was shorter in the patients with liposarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (1.3 and 0.9 months, respectively) than in those with leiomyosarcoma, MPNST, MFH/UPS, and synovial sarcoma (5.6, 6.5, 7.1, and 7.7 months, respectively).\nPazopanib demonstrated acceptable antitumor activity in the Asian patients who had been heavily pretreated for sarcoma, with seemingly more favorable results in the patients with leiomyosarcoma, MPNST, MFH/UPS, and synovial sarcoma than in those with liposarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.","title":"Efficacy of pazopanib monotherapy in patients who had been heavily pretreated for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma: a retrospective case series.","pubmedId":"25885855"}
