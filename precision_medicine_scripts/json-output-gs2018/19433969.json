Patients undergoing a regimen with GM-CSF and ATRA were evaluated as compared with a historical control group of subjects.\nFor patients enrolled in this study, the complete remission plus complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery rate was 61.5% as compared with 41.4% for the historical control group of subjects. The relapse rate was 38.5% and 44.8% for the study and control group of subjects, respectively. Two-year probabilities were 45.5% (study group) and 47.4% (control group) for disease-free survival and 38.5% (study group) and 36.2% (control group) for overall survival. The most frequent side effects included fever, headache, and skin lesions with pruritus and dyspnea with pulmonary congestion, similar to ATRA syndrome.\nPriming with GM-CSF plus ATRA during anthracycline-based chemotherapy is feasible in terms of response rate, but the toxicity of the regimen is significant.","title":"A pilot study of priming with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor plus all-trans retinoic acid combined with remission induction chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"19433969"}
