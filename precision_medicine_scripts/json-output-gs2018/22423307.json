He was evaluated with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging demonstrated minimal enhancement and hemorrhage of a cerebellar mass. Cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is extremely rare in the cerebellum at any age but especially in children. The atypical findings of minimal enhancement, cerebellar location and hemorrhagic presentation combine to make the prospective diagnosis of GBM a difficult one. This rare combination of findings has not been previously reported.","title":"Pediatric cerebellar hemorrhagic glioblastoma multiforme.","pubmedId":"22423307"}
