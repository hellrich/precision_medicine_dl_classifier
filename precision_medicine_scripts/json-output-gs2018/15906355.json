The aim of our study was to determine the amplification status of the HDMX gene and the expression of the HDMX mRNA (particularly that of the HDMX-S splice variant) in soft-tissue sarcomas (STS). Patients with STS were evaluated for the status of HDMX gene amplification (n \u003d 66) and HDMX-S mRNA expression (n \u003d 57) within their tumors. DNA, total RNA and protein were isolated from frozen tumor tissue. We determined that the HDMX-S splice variant transcript was predominant in a subset (14%) of tumor samples and that its expression was correlated with decreased patient survival (15 vs. 53 months, p \u003c 0.0001, log-rank test) and with a 17-fold increased risk of a tumor-related death (p \u003c 0.0001, multivariate Cox\u0027s regression model). The tumors from these patients also expressed elevated levels of HDMX-S protein. The HDMX gene was amplified in 17% of STSs, and the gene amplification was associated with poor prognosis (RR \u003d 6.5, p \u003c 0.0001). There was no correlation between the HDMX gene amplification and overexpression of the HDMX-S splice variant. In summary, our data indicate that both the overexpression of the HDMX-S transcript as well as HDMX gene amplification are important prognostic markers for STS.","title":"Significance of HDMX-S (or MDM4) mRNA splice variant overexpression and HDMX gene amplification on primary soft tissue sarcoma prognosis.","pubmedId":"15906355"}
