Malignant melanoma spreads through hematogenous, lymphagenous path, or by iatrogenic implantations. In this report, we present an unusual case in which a patient experienced the development of melanoma within the split-thickness skin graft donor site on the contralateral lower extremity. Metastases of malignant melanoma occurred in the donor site of the graft, 8 weeks after primary tumor excision, ipsilateral axillary dissection, and reconstruction with a split-thickness skin graft harvested from the contralateral upper thigh. As eight melanoma nodules were seen in donor area, we strongly suspect that spreading of melanoma occurred via a true hematogenous pathway in this case.","title":"True hematogenous metastases of melanoma on contralateral skin graft donor site: a case report.","pubmedId":"19011515"}
