The study cases included 38 histologically proven papillary carcinomas and 54 other palpable thyroid nodules. The three most important variables in making the prediction of papillary carcinoma were intranuclear inclusions, papillary structures without vessels and cells with metaplastic cytoplasm.","title":"A step-wise logistic regression analysis of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.","pubmedId":"3459329"}
