FAS (oncogenic antigen-519) is up-regulated in about 50% of breast cancers, is an indicator of poor prognosis, and has recently been functionally associated with the Her2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene.\nWe assessed the antitumoral effects of orlistat against the human breast cancer cell line SK-Br3, an in vitro paradigm of FAS and Her2/neu overexpression in breast cancer.\nCell cycle analyses revealed that micromolar concentrations of orlistat induced, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, significant changes in the distribution of cell populations including a complete loss of G2-M phase, S-phase accumulation and a concomitant increase in the emerging sub-G1 (apoptotic) cells. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, an early event required for cells committed to apoptosis, was more predominant in orlistat-treated G1 phase cells. When we characterized signaling molecules participating in the cellular events following orlistat-induced inhibition of FAS activity and preceded inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation, a dramatic down-regulation of Her2/neu-coded p185(Her2/neu) oncoprotein was found in orlistat-treated SK-Br3 cells (\u003e90% reduction). Interestingly, a significant accumulation of the DNA-binding protein PEA3, a member of the Ets transcription factor family that specifically targets a PEA3-binding motif present on the Her2/neu gene promoter and down-regulates its activity, was observed in orlistat-treated SK-Br3 cells. When a Luciferase reporter gene driven by the Her2/neu promoter was transiently transfected in SK-Br3 cells, orlistat exposure was found to dramatically repress the promoter activity of Her2/neu gene, whereas a Her2/neu promoter bearing a mutated binding DNA sequence was not subject to negative regulation by orlistat, thus demonstrating that the intact PEA3 binding site on the Her2/neu promoter is required for the orlistat-induced transcriptional repression of Her2/neu overexpression. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of FAS gene expression similarly repressed Her2/neu gene expression in a PEA3-dependent manner, thus ruling out a role for non-FAS orlistat-mediated effects. When the combination of orlistat and the anti-Her2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptintrade mark) in either concurrent (orlistat + trastuzumab) or sequential (orlistat --\u003e trastuzumab; trastuzumab --\u003e orlistat) schedules was tested for synergism, addition or antagonism using the combination index (CI) method of Chou-Talalay, co-exposure of orlistat and trastuzumab demonstrated strong synergistic effects (CI10-90 \u003d 0.110-0.847), whereas sequential exposure to orlistat followed by trastuzumab (CI10-90 \u003d 0.380-1.210) and trastuzumab followed by orlistat (CI10-90 \u003d 0.605-1.278) mainly showed additive or antagonistic interactions. Indeed, orlistat-induced FAS inhibition synergistically promoted apoptotic cell death when concurrently combined with trastuzumab as determined by an ELISA for histone-associated DNA fragments. Importantly, the degree of FAS expression in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines was predictive of sensitivity to orlistat-induced anti-proliferative effects as determined by a MTT-based characterization of metabolically viable breast cancer cells. Moreover, hypersensitivity to orlistat-induced cytotoxicity was observed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells engineered to overexpress Her2/neu (MCF-7/Her2-18 cells), which exhibit a significant up-regulation of FAS expression and activity.\nThese findings reveal that the development of more potent and/or bioavailable orlistat\u0027s variants targeting the lipogenic activity of FAS may open a novel therapeutic avenue for treating Her2/neu-overexpressing breast carcinomas.","title":"Antitumoral actions of the anti-obesity drug orlistat (XenicalTM) in breast cancer cells: blockade of cell cycle progression, promotion of apoptotic cell death and PEA3-mediated transcriptional repression of Her2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene.","pubmedId":"15870086"}
