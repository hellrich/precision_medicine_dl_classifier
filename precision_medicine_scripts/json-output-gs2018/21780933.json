After removal of the silicone prosthesis, the mass was found to arise from the scleral socket. Histopathological analysis demonstrated a malignant tumor composed of markedly pleomorphic cells with a high mitotic rate. An undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma was diagnosed. Complete right orbital exenteration was performed and the patient underwent radiotherapy\nThis is the first report of an undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma arising from a scleral socket with a silicone implant.","title":"Undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma in a blind eye with a silicone prosthesis implant: a clinico-pathologic study.","pubmedId":"21780933"}
