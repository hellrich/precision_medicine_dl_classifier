{"publicationTypes":["2016 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is the most common subtype of malignant melanoma in acral locations. It has a more aggressive behavior and poorer prognosis. The age  specific incidence rate of melanoma in Lima - Peru between 2004 - 2005 was 2.04 cases per 100,000 population. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and pathological features and overall survival, in addition to the differences between subgroups of patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a database of patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma since january 2009 to december 2011 at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN). Overall survival (OS) curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons were done using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis for overall survival (OS) was perfomed with the cox proportional hazard regression model. A p-value \u003c 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: ALM was observed in 62.2% of the all-histologic types. The median age was 62.48 years (range: 26 - 96) and it was more frequent in the age group of 60-69 years. Men represented 55.1% of the study population. The most affected location was on the foot (24.3%). Fourteen (13.1%) patients were clinical stage I, 47 (43.9%) II, 27 (25.2%) III and 8 (7.5%) IV. 3yrs-OS was 55.3%. The age and sex were not prognostic factors. The pathologic factors significant for overall survival were clinical stage (p \u003c 0.05), lymph node involvement (p \u003c 0.05), the Breslow (p \u003c 0.04), presence of ulceration (p \u003c 0.012), vascular (p \u003c 0.05) and perineural invasion (p \u003c 0.008). The Independent prognosis factor in only patients with clinical stage I, II and III was lymph node involvement (N3) (p \u003c 0.008). Conclusions: In our patients with acral lentiginous melanoma without metastatic disease, the most important independent prognostic factor was the nodal involvement (N3).","title":"Outcomes and prognostic factors for acral lentiginous melanoma in Peruvian patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_164193-176"}
