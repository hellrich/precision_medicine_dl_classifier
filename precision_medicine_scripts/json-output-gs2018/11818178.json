We used the Science Citation Index to identify all studies citing the Panel Report that were also empirical, cost-effectiveness analyses (n\u003d18). We randomly selected two groups for comparison (N\u003d54). Studies were compared using contingency tables.\nSignificantly more studies that cited the Panel Report used a 3% discount rate than did post-report comparison studies (p\u003d0.03) and pre-report comparison studies (p\u003d0.03). There was a nonsignificant trend for studies citing the Panel Report to be more likely to use QALYs and incremental ratios (range of p\u003d0.11 to p\u003d0.20).\nWe found evidence that the Panel Report had an impact on practice. However, 31% of the studies citing the Panel Report did not follow the recommendation to use a 3% discount rate, and only 28% followed all three recommendations.","title":"Impact of the U.S. panel on cost-effectiveness in health and medicine.","pubmedId":"11818178"}
