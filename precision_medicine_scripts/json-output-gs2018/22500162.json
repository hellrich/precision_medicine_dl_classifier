There are no reliable markers for predicting in which patients this metastasis will occur. DCUN1D1, also known as squamous cell carcinoma-related oncogene, is associated with tumor progression and poor outcomes in NSCLC. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of DCUN1D1 expression in cases of brain metastasis due to NSCLC.\nPrimary tumor samples from a total of 71 cases of NSCLC, either with (n\u003d40) or without (n\u003d31) brain metastasis, were evaluated for DCUN1D1 expression by immunohistochemistry analysis.\nDCUN1D1 expression was detected in 16 patients (23%) and tended to correlate with T classification (15% of T1-2 tumors vs. 30% of T3-4 tumors, p\u003d0.083). DCUN1D1 expression was significantly associated with tumor stage. It was observed in none of the patients with stage I disease, 10% of those with stage II disease, and 29% with stage III disease (p\u003d0.009). In addition, 14 of 16 DCUN1D1-positive patients resulted in brain metastasis (p\u003d0.01). The odds ratio of brain metastasis for patients with DCUN1D1 expression was 3.112 (p\u003d0.009).\nDCUN1D1 expression may play a role in tumor progression and development of brain metastasis in patients with NSCLC. Evaluation of DCUN1D1 expression may provide assistance in identifying those patients who are at higher risk for brain metastasis.","title":"Immunohistochemical Expression of DCUN1D1 in Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma: Its Relation to Brain Metastasis.","pubmedId":"22500162"}
