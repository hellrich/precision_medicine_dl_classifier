The microscopic appearances, immunophenotype and behaviour of such tumours relate to the genetic events to a variable extent. This paper reviews the molecular pathology and related morphological and clinical features of sarcomas with non-EWS translocations. These include synovial sarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, infantile fibrosarcoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour.","title":"Soft tissue sarcomas with non-EWS translocations: molecular genetic features and pathologic and clinical correlations.","pubmedId":"19396640"}
