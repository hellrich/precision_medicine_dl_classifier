Here, we evaluate a rapid fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) technology (HER2 instant quality (IQ) FISH pharmDx Kit) for detection of HER2 in patients with BR and gastro-oesophageal cancer using 30 FFPE samples that had been previously evaluated with the PathVysion HER2 DNA Probe Kit. Cases were scored as positive (HER2:CEN-17 ≥2.0), negative (HER2:CEN-17 \u003c2.0) or equivocal according to the ASCO/CAP 2013 BR cancer guidelines. Ten samples were positive for HER2 amplification while 20 were negative; none were equivocal. The IQ FISH was able to detect low level amplification (HER2:CEN-17 ratio 2.4). The HER2 IQ FISH pharmDx Kit is a FDA approved kit that offers a rapid turnaround time (approximately 3.5 h) and in our laboratory was 100% concordant with prior PathVysion results.","title":"Rapid fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for HER2 (ERBB2) assessment in breast and gastro-oesophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"25576545"}
