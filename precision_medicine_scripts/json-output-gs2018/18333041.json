{"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Hepatic adenomas are benign tumours of the liver most commonly seen in premenopausal women. However, it is now clear that adenomas may occur in males. This small series reviews the characteristics of hepatic adenomas in males.\nThree cases of solitary hepatic adenoma occurring in otherwise well male patients (age 22-48 years) are presented. Two patients presented with abnormal liver function tests while one presented with abdominal pain. Imaging of the lesions demonstrated typical appearances of hepatocellular adenoma, resection was undertaken in all cases and all patients remain alive and well.\nUp to 20% of adenomas are documented as occurring in male patients. Most are solitary and occur in patients without recognised risk factors (steroid therapy and glycogen storage diseases types I and III). However, multiple adenomas are most commonly seen in male patients with risk factors. The imaging characteristics and presentation of adenomas in males are similar to female patients and, most importantly, intraperitoneal rupture and malignant transformation are documented in untreated adenomas in males.","title":"Hepatic adenomas in male patients.","pubmedId":"18333041"}
