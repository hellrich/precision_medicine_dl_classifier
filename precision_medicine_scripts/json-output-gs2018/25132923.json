We report the first case of esophageal LELC showing macroscopic reduction. A 67-year-old male presented with dysphagia and, by endoscopic examination, was found to have a significantly raised tumor of 10 mm in diameter in the thoracic esophagus. The biopsied material showed esophageal cancer. We performed endoscopic submucosal dissection. However, the tumor became flattened, similar to a scar, in only 2 mo. Histologically, the carcinoma cells had infiltrated the submucosal layer. Prominent infiltration of T lymphoid cells that stained positive for CD8 was observed around the carcinoma cells. Therefore, this lesion was considered to be an LELC with poorly differentiated squamous cells. Because the margin was positive, an esophagectomy was performed. Carcinoma cells were detected in the neck in one lymph node. The staging was T1N0M1b. However, the patient has been well, without adjuvant therapy or recurrence, for more than 5 years.
