We identified significant positive associations between relative TPD52 and ERBB2 transcript levels in human diagnostic breast cancer samples, and maximal TPD52 expression in the hormone receptor (HR)- and ERBB2-positive sub-group. High-level TPD52 expression was associated with significantly reduced metastasis-free survival, within the overall cohort (log rank test, P \u003d 8.6 × 10(-4), n \u003d 375) where this was an independent predictor of metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.69, 95% confidence interval 1.59-4.54, P \u003d 2.2 × 10(-4), n \u003d 359), and the HR- and ERBB2-positive sub-group (log rank test, P \u003d 0.035, n \u003d 47). Transient TPD52 knock-down in the ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3 and BT-474 produced significant apoptosis, both singly and in combination with transient ERBB2 knock-down. Unlike ERBB2 knock-down, transient TPD52 knock-down produced no reduction in pAKT levels in SK-BR-3 or BT-474 cells. We then derived multiple SK-BR-3 cell lines in which TPD52 levels were stably reduced, and measured significant inverse correlations between pERBB2 and TPD52 levels in viable TPD52-depleted and control cell lines, all of which showed similar proliferative capacities. Our results therefore identify TPD52 as a survival factor in ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cells, and suggest complementary cellular functions for TPD52 and ERBB2.","title":"TPD52 represents a survival factor in ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cells.","pubmedId":"23661506"}
