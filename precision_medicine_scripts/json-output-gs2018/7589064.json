Specificity was further established by demonstrating that TNF responses to tumor cells were inhibited by HLA-DR or HLA-DQ monoclonal antibodies. Most of these clones cross-reacted with allogeneic melanoma cells expressing a potentially restricting HLA allele or a structurally similar one. These data show that shared epitopes of human melanoma cells presented on HLA class II molecules are frequently recognized by autologous CD4+ T lymphocytes.","title":"HLA class II-restricted recognition of common tumor epitopes on human melanoma cells by CD4+ melanoma-infiltrating lymphocytes.","pubmedId":"7589064"}
