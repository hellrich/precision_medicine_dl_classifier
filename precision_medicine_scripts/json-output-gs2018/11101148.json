The present study demonstrates that hypermethylation of the 5\u0027 CpG islands can serve as an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p16INK4a gene in this tumor. We studied 11 HNSCC cell lines and 17 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) primary tumors for p16INK4a gene status by protein/mRNA and DNA genetic/epigenetic analyses to determine the incidence of its inactivation. Our study indicates that: (1) inactivation of p16 protein is frequent in HNSCC cell lines (6/11, 54.5%) and OSCC primary tumors (15/17, 88.2%), (2) inactivation of p16INK4a protein is commonly associated with the presence of gene alteration such as mutation, homozygous deletion and especially aberrant methylation, and (3) genomic sequencing of bisulfite-modified DNA shows that the carcinoma develops a heterogeneous pattern of hypermethylation.","title":"Inactivation of p16INK4a in primary tumors and cell lines of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11101148"}
