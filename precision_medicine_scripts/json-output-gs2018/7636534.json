TIL were isolated from fresh biopsy material and activated with anti-CD3 antibody, OKT3, for 48 hours and expanded in 100 IU/mL r-methionyl Hu IL-2 alanine 125 (r-met Hu IL-2 [ala-125]). At least 10(10) TIL were reinfused intravenously in three divided injections on days 2, 4, and 6 of the protocol. A maximum dose of 30,000 U/kg of IL-2 per injection was administered every 8 hours from day 2 through day 11 for a total of 28 doses.\nSixteen melanoma patients completed the study. Of these, three (19%) showed a durable complete response (CR), nine (56%) had no response (NR), and four (25%) had progressive disease (PD). One nonresponder demonstrated complete tumor regression within 1 year of treatment. Of four assessable RCC patients, two experienced a minor response (MR) and two showed NR. All TIL cultures showed comparably high cytotoxic activity as determined by antibody-redirected lysis (ARL). More importantly, melanoma TIL from responders possessed significantly higher cytotoxicity against autologous tumor cells than TIL from nonresponders (P \u003c .05). Production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-4 was similar for TIL from melanoma responders and nonresponders, or TIL from RCC patients.\nImmunotherapy with polyclonally activated TIL and moderate-dose IL-2 could be successfully used for the treatment of immunogenic tumors with less toxicity and lower costs as compared with high-dose IL-2 protocols.","title":"Adoptive immunotherapy with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interleukin-2 in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma: a pilot study.","pubmedId":"7636534"}
