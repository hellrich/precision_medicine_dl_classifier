At 3 and 9 months of age, he developed localized neuroblastoma in each adrenal, which was managed with surgical resection. Tumors were MYCN non-amplified, with 2p copy gain consistent with the germline translocation. The potential increased risk of neuroblastoma associated with partial trisomy 2p is discussed in the context of this and previously published cases, and may be due to increased constitutional expression of MYCN and ALK genes, both located within the duplicated 2p region.
