We report a 45-year-old male patient with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma who discontinued treatment with ipilimumab due to treatment-related grade 3 colitis and was subsequently treated with the anti-programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab. He has been on treatment with pembrolizumab for more than 20 months with no major toxicities and has achieved an objective partial response, which is ongoing.
