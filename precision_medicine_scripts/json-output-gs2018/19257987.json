Then the recombinant vector was identified by restriction enzyme and sequencing. Next, pcDNA6/v5-his-HER2 was transfected into the EMT6 cell line and the positive clones (EMT6/HER2) were screened with blasticidin. Finally, the expression of HER2 in EMT6/HER2 was detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.\nThe fragment of HER2 was amplified and pcDNA6/v5-his-HER2 was prepared successfully. No errors were found both in the sequence and ORF of the acquired fragment. The expected fragment of HER2 (1896 bp) was amplified from EMT6/HER2 by RT-PCR and positive signals of HER2 were detected in EMT6/HER2 by immunohistochemistry.\nAn eukaryotic plasmid encoding HER2 (pcDNA6/v5-his-HER2) has been constructed and a cell line expressing HER2 stably has been prepared successfully.","title":"[Construction of an eukaryotic plasmid encoding HER2 and screening of a cell line stably expressing clones].","pubmedId":"19257987"}
