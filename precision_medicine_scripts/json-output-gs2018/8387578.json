The analysis included stage and distribution of disease, tumor-cell phenotype, response to initial and salvage therapy, and disease-free and overall survival.\nThe median age of patients was 44 years (range, 16 to 86). Forty-eight percent of patients tested had lymphomas of T-cell phenotype, 30% lymphomas of B-cell phenotype, and 22% of non-T-, non-B-cell phenotype. Twenty-nine percent of patients had stages I and II disease, 65% demonstrated extranodal involvement, and 32% had skin involvement at presentation. Most patients received intensive chemotherapy and 48% achieved a sustained complete remission (CR), with an additional 17% of patients treated successfully with salvage therapy. Stage was highly predictive of achieving a sustained CR, but bulk disease and B symptoms did not predict for relapse after initial therapy or survival. Of seven patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), three remain disease-free 9 to 42 months after transplant.\nPatients with Ki-1 ALCL have a high frequency of advanced-stage disease and extranodal involvement and are more likely to have tumors of T-cell phenotype than patients with large-cell lymphoma. However, response to standard lymphoma chemotherapy is similar to other patients with large-cell lymphoma, with a high remission rate in early-stage disease. Patients with advanced-stage disease have a poor remission duration and may require more intensive therapy, as may also be the case with large-cell lymphoma.","title":"Primary Ki-1 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma in adults: clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcome.","pubmedId":"8387578"}
