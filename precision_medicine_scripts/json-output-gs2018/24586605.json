All patients who started first-line treatment at our institution between 2000 and 2010 were included to prevent selection and bias due to thereafter arising therapeutic options.\nNo patient received BRAF- or MEK-inhibitors during follow-up. Survival was associated with the pattern of visceral involvement, the presence of brain metastases and the serum lactate dehydrogenase level (all p\u003c0.001). The BRAF-V600 mutational status was not associated with survival and no differences in overall survival were detected according to age, gender or to the cytotoxic agent used for therapy. In Cox regression analysis the presence of brain metastases (hazard ratio 2.3; p\u003c0.001) and an elevated serum LDH (hazard ratio 2.5; p\u003c0.001) were the only factors, which independently predicted survival.\nNo differences in prognosis were observed according to the BRAF mutational status in patients with distant metastasis treated with monochemotherapy.","title":"BRAF-V600 mutations have no prognostic impact in stage IV melanoma patients treated with monochemotherapy.","pubmedId":"24586605"}
