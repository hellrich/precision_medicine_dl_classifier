Especially the skin exposed to the sun is frequently affected. Primary tumors of the same entity in the respiratory mucosa is very rare. We report about a 80 year old man, who came into our clinic with recurrent epistaxis and a nasal congestion on the right side. Attendant, a protrusio of the right bulbus could be seen. After obtaining biopsies the diagnosis of a malignant melanoma of the right maxillary sinus was obvious. We sent the patient to primary radiotherapy with a total dose of 59,4 Gy. With this therapy all clinical symptoms, the patient suffered from stopped to persist. In further development we made some palliative tumor reductions. The overall lifetime with this disease is now 3 years and the patient has still a very good quality of life. Clinical control is performed on a regular basis.","title":"[Malignant melanoma of the maxillary sinus--a case report].","pubmedId":"19037842"}
