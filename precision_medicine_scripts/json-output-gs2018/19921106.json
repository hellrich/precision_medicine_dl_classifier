We present a 71-year-old patient with several nodules on the right temple extending to his right ear. Based on clinical, histological and immunophenotypic criteria, the diagnosis of a primary cutaneous CD30(+) ALK(-) anaplastic large cell lymphoma was made. After local excision and adjuvant radiotherapy no relapse occurred during a follow-up period of three months.","title":"[Primary cutaneous CD30+ ALK(-) anaplastic large cell T-cell lymphoma].","pubmedId":"19921106"}
