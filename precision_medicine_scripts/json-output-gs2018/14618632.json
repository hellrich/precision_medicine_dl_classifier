In contrast to p53, many studies on cancer patients failed to detect mutational inactivation of p73 and reported overexpression of wild-type p73 instead. A possible explanation was provided by the recent discovery of N-terminal truncated isoforms of p73 (DeltaTA-p73) that act as dominant-negative inhibitors of wild-type p53 and TA-p73 and result in tumor growth in nude mice. We investigated the role of DeltaTA-p73 in the development and progression of human melanomas, which lack p53 mutations. We analyzed 8 benign melanocytic nevi, 8 primary melanomas and 19 melanoma metastases for alterations of TA-p73 and DeltaTA-p73 expression using isoform-specific real-time RT-PCR. Based on our results, p73Deltaex2 and Deltaex2/3 spliced transcripts derived from the first promoter were significantly up-regulated in melanoma metastases, whereas DeltaN-p73 generated from the second promoter was the predominant isoform in benign nevi. Moreover, increased expression of p73Deltaex2 and p73Deltaex2/3 correlated with high-levels of both TA-p73 and E2F1. Our data suggest a potential function of DeltaTA-p73 splice isoforms in melanoma progression.","title":"Alterations of DeltaTA-p 73 splice transcripts during melanoma development and progression.","pubmedId":"14618632"}
