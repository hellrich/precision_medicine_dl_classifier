However, the clinical significance of IGF1R/IR is not fully understood, especially in ER-negative BC, which is aggressive and lacks molecularly targeted therapies. The objective of this study was to rationally develop treatment strategies for ER-negative BC with IGF1R/IR inhibitor. Method: We treated 6 ER-negative BC cell lines that express IGF1R/IR and have p53 mutations, a genetic hallmark of ER-negative BC, with KW2450, a dual tyrosine-kinase inhibitor against IGFR/IR. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm IGF1R, IR, or phosphor-IGFR/IR expression. To evaluate growth-inhibition effect, Cell-titer-blue assay and xenograft model were performed in vitro and in vivo. For apoptosis assay, Annexin V staining and western blotting of cleaved-caspase 8 and -PARP were performed. The amounts of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured as a candidate marker in predicting the efficacy of KW2450. Result: The values of IC50 are shown in the table. In cell-cycle analysis, all 6 cell lines treated with KW2450 accumulated in the G2/M phase and underwent cell death (sub-G1) in a dose-dependent manner. MCF7 and ZR15.1 cells, which have wild-type p53, had the same response to KW2450, which suggests that this phenotype is independent of p53 function. We attributed this cell death to apoptosis following apoptosis assay using one of the most sensitive cell lines, MDA-MB-468. We found that ROS accumulation correlated with a susceptibility to cell death at the dose of 0.5 m, as shown below. In the xenograft model, we used SUM149 cells, a widely-used model, and saw a significant tumor growth-inhibitory effect at 20 or 40 mg/kg/day compared with vehicle control. Conclusion: ER-negative BCs that express IGF1R or IR are sensitive to KW2450. ROS accumulation with KW2450 treatment may be a good predictive marker of patient benefit from KW2450 treatment.Molecular/genetic profiles and IC50s to KW-2450 in breast cancer cell lines, TN; triple-negative","title":"IGF1R/IR axis is a novel treatment target in ER-negative breast cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-2431"}
