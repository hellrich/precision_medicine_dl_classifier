Globally, there is a large male predominance in both esophageal squamous and adenocarcinoma.  The reasons for this gender difference and the possible role of estrogen are unclear.  The objective of this study is to determine if estrogen exposure is consistent with the male predominance observed in esophageal cancer incidence.   Methods:    A database assessment of esophageal cancer incidence rates (age-adjusted) from 1975 to 2008 was conducted in the National SEER 9 Database and the Maryland Cancer Registry. Rates by gender and age were calculated.  Gender-specific incidence rate ratios were compared across age groups. Annual percentage change (APC) was compared for each gender-age group.  Results:     In both national and state, male and female, adeno and squamous cell histologies, incidence rates increase with patient age. SEER data trends revealed the 50-64 aged female cohort as the only gender-age cohort APC decreasing between 1975-2008. Furthermore, a significant increase in incidence for females is observed in the 65+ age groups; whereas among males, the rates are rising in all age groups.   Conclusions:    Using age as a proxy for estrogen exposure, our findings suggest a hormonal component in the declining male: female esophageal cancer incidence rate ratios with increasing age and confirm gender differences in incidence long observed in esophageal cancer. Histological features may be predictive of a lower rate ratio. (Bodelon et al. 2011) Estrogen exposure may play a protective role in esophageal cancer which dissipates with time after age 60-69. Our data suggest possible future roles of estrogen as a chemopreventive agent in esophageal cancer (Barone et al. 2011).Esophageal cancer annual percentage change, 1975-2008, SEER 9.Age 50-64Age 65-74Age 75+Males+1.2+1.4+1.9Females-1.5+0.3+0.7The M: F incidence ratio decreases with age in the nation (SEER) and in Maryland.Male to female incidence ratio, SEER, 1975-2008 and MD Registry 1992-2008.Age 40-49Age 50-59Age 60-69Age 70-79Age 80-89SEER9.07.67.95.74.3MD6.06.05.44.23.3","title":"Esophageal cancer incidence gender disparity.","pubmedId":"ASCO_93104-114"}
