However, certain NSAIDs also have antitumor activities in various cancers, including head and neck cancer, through cyclooxygenase-dependent or independent pathways. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1 (NAG-1), a TGF- superfamily protein, is induced by NSAIDs and has been shown to be induced by several antitumorigenic compounds and to exhibit proapoptotic and antitumorigenic activities. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that tolfenamic acid (TA) transcriptionally induced the expression of NAG-1 during TA-induced apoptosis of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cells. TA reduced the viability of ATC cells in a dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis, findings that were coincident with NAG-1 expression. Overexpression of the NAG-1 gene using cDNA enhanced the apoptotic effect of TA, whereas suppression of NAG-1 expression by small interfering RNA attenuated TA-induced apoptosis. Subsequently, we found that intracellular ROS generation plays an important role in activating the proapoptotic protein NAG-1. Then, we confirmed antitumorigenic effects of TA in a nude mouse orthotopic ATC model, and this result accompanied the augmentation of NAG-1 expression and ROS generation in tumor tissue. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TA induces apoptosis via NAG-1 expression and ROS generation in in vitro and in vivo ATC models, providing a novel mechanistic explanation and indicating a potential chemotherapeutic approach for treatment of ATC.","title":"Tolfenamic acid induces apoptosis and growth inhibition in anaplastic thyroid cancer: involvement of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1 expression and intracellular reactive oxygen species generation","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3510"}
