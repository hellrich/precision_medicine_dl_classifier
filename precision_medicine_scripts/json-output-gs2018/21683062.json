Amplification and overexpression of MYCN have been shown to be closely related with high risk and poor prognosis in neuroblastoma. This suggests that MYCN is an important target for the antitumor therapy. Recently, vector-based RNA interference (RNAi) systems have been successfully used to eliminate gene expression, but knockdown of MYCN by vector-based RNAi as a therapeutic model for neuroblastoma has not been fully established. In this study, we used a lentivirus vector-based RNAi approach which expresses short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knockdown MYCN in neuroblastoma cell lines IMR-32 and LAN-1. Western blotting analysis showed that expressions of MYCN were efficiently downregulated after infection with MYCN shRNA expression vector. The stable suppression of MYCN expression induced differentiation and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these changes were associated with caspase-3 activation, p27 upregulation as well as Bcl-2 and MDM2 downregulation. Finally, we demonstrated that downregulation of MYCN expression significantly reduced colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in nude mice. Our data indicate that lentivirus vector-mediated silencing of MYCN in neuroblastoma cells could efficiently and significantly inhibit tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of lentivirus-delivered shRNA as a novel approach for treatment of neuroblastoma and other malignant tumors with MYCN overexpression.","title":"Stable knockdown of MYCN by lentivirus-based RNAi inhibits human neuroblastoma cells growth in vitro and in vivo.","pubmedId":"21683062"}
