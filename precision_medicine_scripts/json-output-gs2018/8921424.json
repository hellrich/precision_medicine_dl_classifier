These clones were previously shown to be involved in the recognition of melanoma-associated antigenic epitopes SAYGEPRKL and AARAVFLAL encoded by gene MAGE-1 and BAGE respectively. All (3/3) anti-MAGE-1 CTL clones displayed TCRBV5 usage and one clonotype was found twice, \u003e 1 year apart, in patient\u0027s PBL. Two out of three anti-BAGE CTL clones showed the same TCRAV/AJ and TCRBV/BJ combinations and differed in the alpha chain CDR3 for two residues and in the beta chain CDR3 for a single nucleotide which, however, did not change translation. These results suggest a pattern of TCR conservation in CTL selected for recognition of MAGE-1 or BAGE peptides on the autoiogous melanoma.","title":"Conserved TCR usage by HLA-Cw* 1601-restricted T cell clones recognizing melanoma antigens.","pubmedId":"8921424"}
