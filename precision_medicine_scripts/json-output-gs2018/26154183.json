However, clinically atypical moles have not been previously recognized as a component of this syndrome, to our knowledge. We describe the first kindred to date with a germline mutation in BAP1 associated with multiple cutaneous melanomas and classic dysplastic nevus syndrome.\nWe describe a 53-year-old man who was initially seen in 2003 with dysplastic nevus syndrome, multiple atypical melanocytic proliferations showing loss of immunostaining for BAP1, and 7 cutaneous melanomas. Germline testing was performed in the proband, his 16-year-old son, and his 13-year-old daughter, revealing a germline mutation in the BAP1 gene (c.592G\u003eT, p.Glu198X) in the proband and in his 16-year-old son. CDKN2A and CDK4 genes were wild type. No members of this kindred reported a history of uveal melanoma.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with multiple melanomas, dysplastic nevus syndrome, and an inactivating germline BAP1 mutation. The coexistence of dysplastic nevus syndrome and a BAP1 germline mutation extends the spectrum of the BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome and may confer a greater risk for cutaneous melanomas.","title":"Multiple Cutaneous Melanomas and Clinically Atypical Moles in a Patient With a Novel Germline BAP1 Mutation.","pubmedId":"26154183"}
