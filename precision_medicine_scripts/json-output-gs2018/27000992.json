In melanoma, induction of a senescent-like state by BRAF-inhibitors (BRAFi) in a fraction of treated cells - instead of killing - contributes to the repression of tumor growth, but may also provide a source for relapse. Here, we demonstrate that NOTCH activation in melanocytes is not only growth-promoting but it also protects these cells against oncogene-induced senescence. In turn, treatment of melanoma cells with an inhibitor of the NOTCH-activating enzyme γ-secretase led to induction of a senescent-like status in a fraction of the cells but overall achieved only a moderate inhibition of melanoma cell growth. However, combination of γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) with BRAFi markedly increased the treatment efficacy particularly in long-term culture. Moreover, even melanoma cells starting to regrow after continuous BRAFi treatment - the major problem of BRAFi therapy in patients - can still be affected by the combination treatment. Thus, combining GSI with BRAFi increases the therapeutic efficacy by, at least partially, prolonging the senescent-like state of treated cells.
