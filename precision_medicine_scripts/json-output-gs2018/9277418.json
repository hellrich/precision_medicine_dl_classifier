The present investigation examines the age-related changes in gastric mucosal tyrosine kinase activity and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) and its structural and functional analog p185c-erbB-2, the protein product of c-erbB-2/c-neu protooncogene. We observed a significantly higher intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and p185c-erbB-2 in the gastric mucosa of 24-mo-old (aged) rats than in that of their 4- or 12-mo-old counterparts. This was associated with increased levels of EGFR protein and steady-state mRNA levels of EGFR and p185c-erbB-2. In addition, we also observed threefold higher steady-state mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha; one of the primary ligands of EGFR) in the gastric mucosa of aged rats than in that of 4-mo-old (young) animals. This was accompanied by a fivefold increase in the relative concentration of the 18-kDa precursor form of TGF-alpha in gastric mucosal membranes but not in the cytosol. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that aging is associated with increased tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and p185c-erbB-2 in the gastric mucosa. Moreover, the observation that aging results in increased accumulation of TGF-alpha in gastric mucosal membranes raises the possibility that the membrane-bound TGF-alpha could partly be responsible for the constitutively active EGFR-induced signaling pathway in the gastric mucosa of aged rats and, in turn, for stimulation of mucosal proliferative activity.","title":"Increased expression of EGFR in gastric mucosa of aged rats.","pubmedId":"9277418"}
