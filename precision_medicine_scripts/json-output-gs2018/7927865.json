We have confirmed this result by multivariate analysis in 178 patients with non-inflammatory breast cancer followed up for a mean period of 6.8 years (SD, 1.6 years). In addition, we have shown that c-erbB2 amplification, found in 30 (17%) specimens, was associated with a high risk of multiple metastases developing simultaneously. In contrast, for the 67 patients with inflammatory breast carcinoma, the most aggressive type of breast carcinoma, the c-erbB2 amplification detected in 24 (36%) specimens was not found to be associated with a higher risk of death, suggesting that the c-erbB2 gene plays a different role in the progression of these 2 types of breast cancer. Furthermore, our data stress the importance of the methodological approach used to determine gene amplification. Although Southern blot hybridization is a tumour- and time-consuming method not easy to adopt in routine clinical practice, this method remains a reference quantitative method.","title":"Association of c-erbB2-gene amplification with poor prognosis in non-inflammatory breast carcinomas but not in carcinomas of the inflammatory type.","pubmedId":"7927865"}
