Between 5-15% of patients with PSC will develop cholangiocarcinoma. The diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with PSC is difficult, as it is often impossible to distinguish benign PSC-related strictures from lesions associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Consequently, most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and have a dismal prognosis at the time of diagnosis. The importance of characterizing patients with PSC who have an increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma and of developing means for early detection of this disease cannot be over-emphasized. Detection of cholangiocarcinoma in asymptomatic patients is additionally important, as this condition is considered a contraindication for liver transplantation. We describe a patient with longstanding Crohn\u0027s disease and PSC who developed cholangiocarcinoma, and review the literature regarding risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma, early detection of cholangiocarcinoma and the significance of existing cholangiocarcinoma in the context of liver transplantation.","title":"[Cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis: \"chronicle of a death foretold\"?].","pubmedId":"12858825"}
