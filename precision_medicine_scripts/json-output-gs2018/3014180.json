The light and electron microscopic appearances are described in a 77-year-old woman. This patient manifested the intraepithelial spread of cancer cells, which suggested that the tumor arose from the mucosal epithelium of the esophagus. The patient died of mediastinal metastasis 11 months after resection. Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the esophagus is a relatively rare lesion, which exhibits a clinically aggressive behavior. Earlier resection and more intensive chemotherapy will be required.","title":"[Primary adenoid cystic carcinoma of the esophagus].","pubmedId":"3014180"}
