Both cell lines display HGF-induced mitogenesis and high level HGF-induced autophosphorylation of MET/HGFR. In both M23 and MM55 cells, HGF induces association with MET/HGFR and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the SH2-domain containing proteins PI3K, GAP and NCK. PLC-gamma exhibited neither HGF-induced increases in tyrosine phosphorylation nor an association with MET/HGFR in these cell lines. Additionally, HGF induced increased transcription of c-fos, c-jun, junB, junD, and c-myc early response genes in both cell lines. We therefore suggest that the second messenger proteins PI3K, GAP and NCK, and possibly the protein products of the c-fos, c-jun, junB, junD and c-myc genes, are important elements in the HGF-induced mitogenic pathway in the normal mouse epithelial cell lines M23 and MM55.","title":"Hepatocyte growth factor-induced signal transduction in two normal mouse epithelial cell lines.","pubmedId":"7549943"}
