Methods:   128 stage IIIB/IV SQC patients were enrolled into this study from May 1st 2009 to May 31st2014, all of which had complete clinical profile. 78 patients received gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect PD-L1 expression; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied to detect FGFR1 amplification. SPSS17.0 was used for statistical analysis.  Results:   80 (62.5%) SQC had IHC positive PD-L1 expression. Among clinical characteristics including gender, age, smoking history, stage, lymph node metastasis and distance metastasis, male patients and smokers had significantly higher expression rates than female and non-smoker (65.5% vs. 22.2%, P \u003d 0.011; 67.0% VS. 44.0%, P \u003d 0.039, respectively). PD-L1 expression had no correlation with response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR) for gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. However, the overall survival (OS) of PD-L1 negative SQC was significantly longer than PD-L1 positive group (29.8 vs. 20.1 months, P \u003d 0.001). 32 of 128 (25%) SQC presented FGFR1 FISH  positive , and stage III patients present lower rate compared with stage IV SQC (17.1% vs. 36.5%, P \u003d 0.013). FGFR1 amplification had no correlation with RR and DCR in patients treated with gemcitabine-base chemotherapy. No correlation between PD-L1 expression and FGFR1 amplification was found (P \u003d 0.916).  Conclusions:   PD-L1 expression could act as a prognosis factor in Chinese stage IIIB/IV SQC patients. PD-L1 expression and FGFR1 amplification might be irrelevant.","title":"Programmed cell death-1 (PD-L1) expression and Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification in Chinese stage III/IV lung squamous lung carcinoma (SQC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_151738-156"}
