Here we report that expression of type III TGF-beta receptor (TRIII) mRNA and protein decreases with advancing stage of neuroblastoma and positively correlates with prognosis. TRIII expression is epigenetically suppressed by MYCN oncogene amplification and TRIII expression can be used as a prognostic marker in neuroblastoma patients with MYCN amplification. TRIII expression in neuroblastoma cells promotes neuronal differentiation and enhances the differentiating effects of FGF2 treatment. Mechanistically, glycosaminoglycan modifications on TRIII bind FGF2 and FGFR1 to promote neuronal differentiation via Erk MAPK and the transcription factor ID1. TRIII-mediated differentiation suppresses tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. These studies characterize a novel co-receptor function for TRIII in FGF2-mediated neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, while identifying potential therapeutic targets and clinical biomarkers for advanced-stage disease. More generally, our results suggest that the targeting of growth factor receptors and downstream signaling pathways may prove useful in promoting neuronal differentiation to suppress neuroblastoma tumor growth.","title":"The type III TGF-beta receptor promotes FGF2-mediated neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-5041"}
