A high rate of BRAF gene mutations in malignant melanomas (66%) and nevi (82%) has recently been reported.\nWe screened a series of 20 Spitz nevi for BRAF mutations in exons 11 and 15 by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).\nBRAF mutations could not be identified in Spitz nevi.\nOur results show that mutations within the BRAF gene are useful markers for the differential diagnosis between Spitz nevus and malignant melanoma.","title":"Absence of BRAF gene mutations differentiates spitz nevi from malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"15330192"}
