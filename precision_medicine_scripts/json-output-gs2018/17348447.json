Only S-100 had prognostic significance for both disease-free (p\u003d0.011) and overall survival (p\u003d0.021). In patients who responded to treatment, S-100 levels decreased significantly from pre-treatment to the time of response (p \u003d 0.050). When patients progressed, levels of MIA and P2-microglobulin increased significantly (p \u003d0.028 and p \u003d0.030, respectively).\nCorrelation with disease evolution was found for S-100, MIA and P2-microglobulin levels. Despite the small sample size of the study, S-100 was a significant prognostic marker for overall survival and disease-free survival.","title":"Melanoma inhibiting activity protein (MIA), beta-2 microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"17348447"}
