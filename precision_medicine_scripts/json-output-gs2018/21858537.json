Serum levels of S-100B, MIA, LDH and YKL-40 were measured in 110 patients with advanced melanoma (36 in stage IIIB/C and 74 in stage IV), in 66 disease-free patients and in 65 healthy controls. Results show that S-100B, MIA and LDH levels were significantly higher in patients with advanced melanoma than in disease-free patients or healthy controls. The combination of S-100B plus MIA had the best diagnostic sensitivity, and the addition of LDH did not further increase this sensitivity. MIA was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival. Patients with both S-100B and MIA elevated had a significant shorter survival than those with both S-100B and MIA under the cut-off. YKL-40 levels did not differentiate patients with advanced melanoma from controls. We concluded that the combination of MIA plus S-100B showed a better prognostic value in advanced melanoma compared to LDH.","title":"Evaluation of multiple serum markers in advanced melanoma.","pubmedId":"21858537"}
