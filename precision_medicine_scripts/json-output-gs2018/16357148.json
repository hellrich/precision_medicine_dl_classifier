However, the mechanisms underlying this selective cell death are poorly understood. Gene expression analysis revealed that HDI treatment induced up-regulation of p21(WAF1/Cip1) and down-regulation of ErbB2 in cancer cells but not normal cells. Overexpression of p21(WAF1/Cip1) and/or silencing of ErbB2 enhanced cancer cell growth inhibition, suggesting that HDI-induced up-regulation/down-regulation of these genes play critical roles in HDI-induced growth inhibition of cancer cells. Most importantly, we found that the gene silencing factor methyl CpG-binding domain protein 3 (MBD3) was not only released from cancer-selective promoter of the HDI up-regulated p21(WAF1/Cip1) gene but also recruited to that of the HDI-down-regulated ErbB2 gene. Furthermore, silencing of MBD3 by small interfering RNA abrogated the HDI-induced gene regulation and growth inhibition in lung cancer but not in normal cells. Together, our results support the critical potential of MBD3 in HDI-induced cancer-selective cell death via cancer differential gene expression.","title":"Methyl CpG-binding domain protein 3 mediates cancer-selective cytotoxicity by histone deacetylase inhibitors via differential transcriptional reprogramming in lung cancer cells.","pubmedId":"16357148"}
