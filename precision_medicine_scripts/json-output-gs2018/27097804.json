Inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 may potentially be effective in the treatment of the IDH mutation driven tumors. Mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase, the other enzyme complex participating in the Krebs cycle and electron transfer of oxidative phosphorylation occur in the paragangliomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and occasionally in the pituitary adenomas. We aimed to determine whether the IDH1(R132H) mutation, the most frequent IDH mutation in human malignancies, occurs in pituitary adenomas.\nWe performed immunohistochemical analysis by using a monoclonal anti-IDH1(R132H) antibody on the tissue microarrays containing specimens from the pituitary adenomas of different hormonal types from 246 patients. In positive samples, the status of the IDH1 gene was further examined by molecular genetic analyses.\nIn all but one patient, there was no expression of mutated IDH1(R132H) protein in the tumor cells by immunohistochemistry. Only one patient with a recurring clinically non-functioning gonadotroph adenoma demonstrated IDH1(R132H)-immunostaining in both the primary tumor and the recurrence. However, no mutation in the IDH1 gene was detected using different molecular genetic analyses.\nIDH1(R132H) mutation occurs only exceptionally in pituitary adenomas and does not play a role in their pathogenesis. Patients with pituitary adenomas do not seem to be candidates for treatment with the inhibitors of mutant IDH1.","title":"A high-throughput analysis of the IDH1(R132H) protein expression in pituitary adenomas.","pubmedId":"27097804"}
