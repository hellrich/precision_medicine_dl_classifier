The objectives were to implement an educational Internet-based program for women to facilitate home screening, to determine whether women would request and use self-collected VS kits, to determine associated risk factors for infection, and to determine satisfaction with the process.\nThe website, www.iwantthekit.org, was designed to encourage women \u003e or \u003d14 years to obtain home-sampling kits. Kits could be obtained in the community, requested by Internet/e-mail, or telephone. Users mailed the self-collected VS to the laboratory. Swabs were tested by 3 NAAT assays. Respondents called for results.\nForty-one of 400 (10.3%) women were chlamydia positive; 95.1% were treated. Questionnaires indicated 89.5% preferred self-collection, 93.5% rated collection easy/very easy, and 86.3% would use the Internet program again. Black race and age \u003c25 years were associated independently with being chlamydia positive, while use of birth control and non-consensual sex were protective. Thirty-six of 41 (87.8%) positive samples were positive by all 3 NAATs, 5/41 (12.2%) were positive by only 2 NAATs, and none were positive by only 1 NAAT. The Internet/e-mail request method was better than the community pick-up approach because 97.2% of kit requests were e-mailed and 87.5% of kits returned for testing were e-mail requested.\nWomen will use the Internet to request and use home-sampling kits for chlamydia. NAAT testing performed well on dry-transported VS. High prevalence was detected and questionnaires indicated high-risk sexual behavior.","title":"Internet-based screening for Chlamydia trachomatis to reach non-clinic populations with mailed self-administered vaginal swabs.","pubmedId":"16652069"}
