Target lesions on the baseline and initial posttherapy contrast-enhanced CT examinations were evaluated by CT texture analysis using TexRAD software before and after image filtering in patients with RECIST SD on initial posttherapy images. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations of CT texture analysis measurements and of other patient factors with OS. The AUC was used to evaluate predictive accuracy.\nIn multivariate analysis (in 23 patients with RECIST SD; median OS, 1.51 years), absolute change in mean positive pixels at spatial scaling filter of 4 mm, change in tumor size, and baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level were predictors of OS (hazard ratio [HR] \u003d 5.05 for decrease in mean positive pixels at spatial scaling filter of 4 mm vs increase, p \u003d 0.007; HR \u003d 4.14 for \u003e 5% increase in tumor size vs otherwise, p \u003d 0.025; and HR \u003d 1.29 for every 100 IU/L increase in baseline LDH level, p \u003d 0.068). A prognostic index containing these three factors was highly accurate for predicting OS at 18 months (AUC \u003d 0.917).\nIn patients with metastatic melanoma and RECIST SD on initial post-therapy CT images, a model incorporating CT texture analysis of target lesions, tumor size changes, and baseline LDH levels was highly accurate in predicting OS.","title":"Predicting Overall Survival in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma on Antiangiogenic Therapy and RECIST Stable Disease on Initial Posttherapy Images Using CT Texture Analysis.","pubmedId":"26295664"}
