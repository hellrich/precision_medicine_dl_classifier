We determined associations of frailty phenotype, a T-cell senescence marker (p16(INK4a) expression), age and demographics with exposures of the intracellular metabolites (IM) and endogenous nucleotides (EN) of tenofovir/emtricitabine (TFV/FTC), efavirenz (EFV), atazanavir (ATV) and ritonavir (RTV).\nPlasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples for drug, IM and EN concentrations were collected at four time points in HIV+ adults receiving TFV/FTC with EFV or ATV/RTV. Subjects underwent frailty phenotyping and p16(INK4a) expression analysis. Non-compartmental analysis generated an area under the curve (AUC) for each analyte. Spearman rank correlation and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess associations between AUC, demographics and ageing markers, adjusting for multiple comparisons with the Holm procedure.\nSubjects (n\u003d79) ranged in age from 22-73 years (median 48 years); 48 were African-American, 24 were female, 54 received EFV. Three subjects (range 51-60 years) demonstrated frailty, with 17 subjects (range 26-60 years) demonstrating pre-frailty. Negative associations were observed between p16(INK4a) expression and each of FTC-triphosphate (r\u003d-0.45), deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP; r\u003d-0.47) and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP; r\u003d-0.57) AUCs (P-values \u003c0.02). TFV and FTC AUCs were larger among subjects with lower renal function or higher chronological age (P-values â‰¤0.05). No associations were observed for EFV, ATV or RTV AUCs.\nAssociations of IM/EN exposure and p16(INK4a) expression observed here suggest that senescence may alter drug phosphorylation, metabolism or transport. This finding warrants further mechanistic study to ensure optimal treatment in the ageing HIV+ population.
