Similar studies were done in a control population of twenty-one patients, ten male and 11 female, with acquired intradermal nevi. Congenital nevi contained high concentrations of estrogen-binding and progesterone-binding nevus cells in both male (6/6) and female patients (5/9). Lesser concentrations of estrogen-binding and progesterone-binding nevus cells were found in congenital nevi from the remaining four female patients. In contrast, acquired intradermal nevi from the control group of patients had little or no detectable estrogen or progesterone binding. These data indicate that congenital nevi are similar in hormonal-binding properties to melanomas and dysplastic nevi, in contrast to acquired intradermal nevi.","title":"Estrogen and progesterone receptors in congenital melanocytic nevi.","pubmedId":"2579107"}
