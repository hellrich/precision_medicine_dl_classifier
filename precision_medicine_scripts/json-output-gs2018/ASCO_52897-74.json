Standard non-transplant AL therapy is melphalan (M) + dexamethasone (D). As adding bortezomib (Bz) to M+ Prednisone improved outcomes in myeloma, we sought to determine if adding Bz to MD improves outcomes in AL. Methods: Eligibility: ECOG PS  3, Cr  5 mg/dL, T.Bili  2.5 x IULN, ALT/AST  3 x IULN, ANC  1.0 K/mm3, PLT  80 K/mm3, peripheral neuropathy (PN)  Gr 2 ( 1 if painful), no lower limit for LVEF. Design: Two-stage phase II study. Stage I: 16 pts with biopsy-proven AL, light chain deposition disease (LCDD) or smoldering myeloma with amyloid (SMM). 1 endpoint: complete hematologic responses (cHR). If 5 cHRs observed, then 2nd stage with 17 more pts, giving 90% power to detect a true cHR rate of 50%. 2 endpoints: overall HR, organ response (OrR), and survival. Therapy: M (9 mg/m2 PO d 1-4; 6 mg/m2 if Cr \u003e 2.5 mg/dL), Bz (1.3 mg/m2 IV d 1, 8, 15, 22; 1.0 mg/m2 if baseline PN) and D (40 mg PO/IV days of /after Bz; 20 mg if  70 yrs, edema, or CHF) in 4-6 wk cycles. PN assessed with the FACT/GOG-Ntx survey. Results: 30 pts enrolled (26 AL, 2 LCDD, 2 SMM). Med age: 65 (range: 47-83). Med # prior Rx: 1 (range: 0-4; 9 with prior ASCT). Tn-BNP stage 1/2/3: 11/9/10. PS 0-1/2-3: 27/3. Here, we update response data for the 16 pts comprising stage 1 of this study. One pt not evaluable for HR included in toxicity data (n\u003d17). Med F/U: 10.6 mos. Med # cycles: 6 (range 3-17; 4 pts still on treatment). 15 pts had HR (9 cHR). Med # cycles to best response: 3 (range 2-9). 2/10 pts with cardiac AL had OrR. 7/8 pts with renal AL had 25% decrease in proteinuria. Abnormal FACT-GOG-Ntx Sensory/Dysfunction scores improved by cycle 4 in 6/12 pts. Two pts died (after 1 and 4.5 mos, from PD and pneumonia, respectively), and 1 stopped due to PN. Despite baseline dose adjustments, 12 pts needed further reductions of  1 study meds during therapy (10 Bz). Gr 3-4 heme AEs: ANC (2), PLTs (12). Gr 3-4 non-heme AEs (in 2 pts): edema (6), fatigue (4), infection (4), syncope (3), PN (3), SVT (2), dehydration (2), renal failure (3). Reversible cardiomyopathy attributed to Bz in 1 pt (cycle 8). Conclusions: MD-Bz is active vs AL: 94% HR (56% cHR). Toxicity is manageable with baseline/subsequent drug adjustments.","title":"Use of melphalan (M)/dexamethasone (D)/bortezomib in AL amyloidosis.","pubmedId":"ASCO_52897-74"}
