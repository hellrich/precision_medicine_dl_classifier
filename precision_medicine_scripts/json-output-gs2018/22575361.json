As such, their clinical behavior and response to treatment are poorly described in the literature.\nWe queried the centralized cancer registry and pathology archives at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution and identified 22 patients with a diagnosis of ES. We excluded two patients because of inadequate data. A pathologist reviewed patient charts and reexamined available histological slides. This study was performed with institutional review board approval.\nThe median age at diagnosis was 27.8 y; most patients (75%) were male. Regional lymph node metastases were present in 10% of patients at presentation. The majority of tumors (57.9%) recurred and 35% recurred more than once, although the number of recurrences did not affect survival (P \u003d 0.48). Patients did not experience a decrease in time to recurrence with increasing number of resections. The median time between resection and recurrence was 1.23 y and the maximum was 18.8 y. Median overall survival was 56.2 mo and 5-y survival was 92%.\nOur study reveals that ES is an extremely rare tumor with a protracted and recurrent course, but overall survival may be more favorable than in the past. Patients benefit from aggressive and repeated resection. Epithelioid sarcoma is unique because it metastasizes to regional nodal basins. Extended surveillance is indicated, because recurrences can appear after decades of quiescence.","title":"Epithelioid sarcoma: one institution\u0027s experience with a rare sarcoma.","pubmedId":"22575361"}
