Amplification of 8q24 is one of the most frequent events in esophageal cancer. To define whether C-MYC is the target gene for 8q24 amplification, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization using a MYC (8q24.12 approximately q24.13) probe in esophageal cancer from southern China. Furthermore, we detected the expression status of several genes including C-MYC, TRIB1 (alias C8FW), and FAM84B (alias NSE2) in the regions of 8q24 via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or immunohistochemical analysis (or both). Distinct amplification of 8q24 was found in esophageal carcinomas. Only 4 of 46 cases showed obvious protein expression in part of the esophageal cancerous nest. In particular, increased protein expression of C-MYC was shown only in a small part of a cancerous nest in the four cases. Positive C-MYC staining was detected mainly in the cytoplasm of esophageal cancer cells. No expression of TRIB1 was detected in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Of 59 cases, 39 (66%) cases showed increased expression of FAM84B in esophageal carcinomas. The results suggest that C-MYC and TRIB1 may not be the amplification target of 8q24 in esophageal cancer. FAM84B might be involved in the genesis or development of esophageal cancer in southern China. Whether FAM84B is the amplification target of esophageal cancer awaits further investigation.","title":"Negative implication of C-MYC as an amplification target in esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"16490593"}
