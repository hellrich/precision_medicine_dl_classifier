To explore the implication of p53 alteration in Ewing\u0027s sarcoma, we analyzed the deletion and sequence alterations of p53 and abnormal amplification of MDM2, which acts as a functional inhibitor of p53, in 35 tissue specimens. Quantitative genomic PCR analysis showed that 2 of 35 tumors have extremely low levels of the p53 gene, indicating a homozygous deletion of the gene. Mutational analysis of exons 4 to 9 of p53 by PCR-SSCP revealed that 3 of 35 tumors carry sequence alterations in exons 5 or 8, and DNA sequencing analysis identified missense point mutations at codon 132 (AAG--\u003eATG, lysine--\u003emethionine) and codon 135 (TGC--\u003eTCC, cystein--\u003eserine) in exon 5, and codon 287 (GAG--\u003eGTG, glutamic acid--\u003evaline) in exon 8 from these tumors. No abnormal amplification of the MDM2 gene was recognized. Taken together, our data demonstrate that p53 is genetically altered in a small fraction of Ewing\u0027s sarcoma.","title":"P53 mutations in Ewing\u0027s sarcoma.","pubmedId":"11295075"}
