Targeted therapy for melanoma has been advancing with agents directed to mutated BRAF, accounting for 50% of melanoma patients. The c-Met pathway is known to play a role in melanoma tumorigenesis and preliminary data from our laboratory suggested that this pathway is preferentially activated in NRAS-mutated tumors. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that melanomas carrying the mutated NRAS genotype are uniquely sensitively to c-Met inhibition, thus providing rationale for therapeutic targeting of c-Met in this patient cohort. Using primary human melanomas with known BRAF/NRAS genotypes, we observed greater immunostaining for phosphorylated (activated) c-Met in NRAS-mutated and wt/wt tumors, compared to BRAF-mutated tumors. NRAS-mutated and wt/wt cell lines also demonstrated more robust c-Met activation in response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Knock-down of mutated N-Ras, but not wild type N-Ras, by RNA interference resulted in decreased c-Met phosphorylation. Compared to BRAF mutants, NRAS-mutated melanoma cells were more sensitive to pharmacologic c-Met inhibition in terms of c-Met activation, Akt phosphorylation, tumor cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. This enhanced sensitivity was observed in wt/wt cells as well, but was a less consistent finding. On the basis of these experimental results, we propose that c-Met inhibition may be a useful therapeutic strategy for melanomas with NRAS mutations, as well as some tumors with a wt/wt genotype.","title":"Association of activated c-Met with NRAS-mutated human melanomas.","pubmedId":"22020736"}
