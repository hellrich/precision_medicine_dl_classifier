But less information is available on specific patterns of chromosomal amplifications which distinguish different areas of head and neck tumors. To elucidate genetic mechanisms causing the aggressive growth and high proliferation of hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we performed reverse chromosome painting (RCP) on a total of eight hypopharyngeal SCC including invasive carcinoma and preinvasive tissue. Five hypopharyngeal invasive carcinomas showed amplifications on chromosome 3q. Furthermore, we detected gains on chromosomes 11q and 6p. Compared to the histologically classified preinvasive tissues, we found amplified alterations on chromosome 6p, 11q and 12q, but none of them showed gains on chromosome 3q. This observed heterogeneity in hypopharyngeal SCC might reflect a specific role of chromosome 3q as a late event in the highly invasive capacity of these SCC.","title":"Genetic imbalances in preinvasive tissue of hypopharynx provide evidence for cytogenetic heterogeneity.","pubmedId":"11605038"}
