Early identification of risk factors and increased CV risk may help decrease of morbidity and mortality. An optimal age for CV risk factors screening ages of 40 in males and of 50 in females have been identified. CV risk profile of persons in these age categories has been examined by general practitioners and recorded for the purposes of this cross-sectional survey.\n1812 persons, males at average age of 40 years and females at average age of 50 years, were included into the survey. In each of the examined family and personal history including pharmacological were recorded into the study protocol as well as abusus and physical activity patterns. Basic anthropometrical parameters, e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, body mass index and laboratory measures including blood lipids and glycaemia. The participating physicians recorded newly identified risk factors CV disease and determined the global CVD risk according to the SCORE charts. Percentage of those already treated for any of the main CVD risk factors and, among these, also attaining the treatment goals. The percentage of patients with a newly identified CV risk factor was calculated. We also tested the hypothesis of a relationship between positive family history of any of the followed risk factors and its risk in the examined probands using Pearson´s test.\n961 males, average age of 42.9 ± 4.7 years, and 851 females , average age of 51.2 ± 3.6 years, were enrolled into the study. 49% of males and 31% of females were overweight and 32% men and 31% of women were obese. There were 36% of smokers among men and 22% among women. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 11% in males and also in females. Arterial hypertension was diagnosed in 43% of males and 45% of females while dyslipidemia was present in 39% of males and 41% of females. Pharmacological treatment of any of the above mentioned diseases was used in 48% of the probands, however, only 7% of them attained treatment goals of blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol and glycaemia. Type 2 diabetes was newly identified in 3% of both males and females, arterial hypertension in 8% of males and 5% of females and dyslipidemia was newly detected in 20% of probands of both genders. Non-pharmacological treatment was recommended to 62% of male and to 65% of female participants, respectively. Pharmacological treatment was initiated in 53% of males and 51% of females. In both genders this was mostly antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibitors (29% of males and 24% of females) and lipid lowering therapy with a statin (29% of males, 27% females). The analysis of relationship between the positive family history of any of the followed diseases and their presence in the probands examined revealed significant increases of the risk for arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia.\nThe survey following CV risk profile in a cohort of 40 years old men and 50 years old women showed high prevalence of CV risk factors in these age categories in the Czech probands. The high frequency of modifiable risk factors and the need to initiate pharmacological treatment in more than one half of the examined population documents the need of early detection of risk. Genetic determination of individual major risk factors for CVD mirrored in the positive family history represents an important component of the global cardiovascular risk and must be actively detected and taken into account for the risk stratification.","title":"[Cardiovascular risk profile in 40-year old men and 50-year old women in the Czech Republic: results of a cross-sectional survey].","pubmedId":"25600047"}
