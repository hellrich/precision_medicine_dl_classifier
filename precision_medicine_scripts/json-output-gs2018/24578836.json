Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is the malignancy of melanocytes that are mainly located in the skin and mucous membranes.\nThis study tried to evaluate the incidence and mean survival time of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) in Yazd, Iran. It seems that the epidemiology and clinical aspects of CMM in Iran are different from those in other parts of the world; also due to the limited and scattered studies there isn\u0027t lot in the literature regarding CMM in Iran.\nThis study used data obtained from the cancer registry center in the province of Yazd for a period of 21 years (1988 - 2008). Population and statistical data were gathered from \"National Organization for Civil Registration\". Population-based data were analyzed, focusing on the incidence and mean survival time over this 21 year period.\nThe mean incidence rate for CMM in Yazd-Iran between 1988 and 2008 was 0.40 per 100,000 for males and 0.27 per 100,000 for females per year, and the incidence of CMM was relatively constant during this period of time. The mean survival rates for women were better than men (80.5% and 76.3% respectively).\nCMM in Yazd is a low-incidence skin tumor that shows a relatively fixed incidence between 1988 and 2008, Higher incidences of CMM were found in sun-exposed areas (especially head and neck areas), with more incidence in men. Skin cancers and CMM incidence in Iran is lower than western countries, most probably due to geographical zone, genetic factors, skin type, society-related customs including clothing styles.","title":"Cutaneous malignant melanoma in central iran: a 20-year study.","pubmedId":"24578836"}
