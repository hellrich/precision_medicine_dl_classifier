The tumors included 14 juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas (grade 1), 13 low grade fibrillary astrocytomas (grade II), 8 anaplastic astrocytomas (grade III), and 24 glioblastomas multiforme (grade IV). Proliferation indices were calculated by computer-based image analysis after immunostaining with the MIB-1 antibody against the Ki-67 proliferation-associated antigen. Western blot analysis for TN on fresh frozen tumor tissue from 23 of the 59 astrocytomas indicated up to 4-fold higher TN expression in glioblastomas multiforme than in nontumorous control tissues. Enhanced intercellular expression of TN was observed by immunohistochemistry in glioblastomas multiforme. More-over, TN immunostaining was consistently greater within and around the walls of hyperplastic blood vessels than nonhyperplastic vessels of both high grade tumors and juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas. Juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas with increased TN expression by Western blot analysis had vascular hyperplasia by light microscopy. Proliferation indices moderately correlated with tumor grade. Enhanced immunohistochemical expression of TN was associated with higher tumor grade with higher proliferation indices. The strong association of TN and vascular hyperplasia, regardless of tumor grade, suggests that TN may play a crucial role in angiogenesis.","title":"Tenascin expression in astrocytomas correlates with angiogenesis.","pubmedId":"7531617"}
