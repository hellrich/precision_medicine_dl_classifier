We consider it as congenital leukemia, as the symptoms started in the first month of life of the affected child. This case of leukemia is characterized by t(3;4;6)(q26;q25;q21) cytogenetic abnormality. The blasts in flow cytometry analysis expressed markers of megakaryocytic lineage along with expression of myeloperoxidase in 30% of them. This type of acute myelogenous leukemia with severe eosinophilia can be considered as a distinct clinicopathologic entity.","title":"Severe Eosinophilia in an infant with congenital acute myeloid leukemia with t(3;4;6)(q26;q25;q21): a case report.","pubmedId":"20562653"}
