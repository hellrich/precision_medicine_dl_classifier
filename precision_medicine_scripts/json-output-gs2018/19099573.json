EZH2 is part of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and trimethylates H3K27. This histone mark recruits the BMI1-containing PRC1 that silences the genes marked by PRC2. Based on their role in stem cells, EZH2 and BMI1 have been predicted to contribute to a poor outcome for cancer patients.\nWe have analysed the expression of EZH2 and BMI1 in a well-characterised dataset of 295 human breast cancer samples.\nInterestingly, although EZH2 overexpression correlates with a poor prognosis in breast cancer, BMI1 overexpression correlates with a good outcome. Although this may reflect transformation of different cell types, we also observed a functional difference. The PcG-target genes INK4A and ARF are not expressed in tumours with high BMI1, but they are expressed in tumours with EZH2 overexpression. ARF expression results in tumour protein P53 (TP53) activation, and we found a significantly higher proportion of TP53 mutations in tumours with high EZH2. This may explain why tumours with high EZH2 respond poorly to therapy, in contrast to tumours with high BMI1.\nOverall, our data highlight that whereas EZH2 and BMI1 may function in a \u0027linear\u0027 pathway in normal development, their overexpression has different functional consequences for breast tumourigenesis.","title":"EZH2 and BMI1 inversely correlate with prognosis and TP53 mutation in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"19099573"}
