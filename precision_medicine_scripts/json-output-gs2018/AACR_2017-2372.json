In attempting to identify specific downstream signaling pathways of KIT/D816V, we found that KIT/D816V but not wild-type KIT can bind to Xkr5 that was not studied previously. In addition to the association with KIT/D816V, Xkr5 is phosphorylated at Tyr 369, Tyr487 and Tyr 543 by KIT/D816V, and the phosphorylation is mediated by only mutations of Asp 816 in KIT but not by other KIT mutations that occurred in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and melanoma. Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Xkr5 is not dependent on Src family kinases that play a crucial role in the activation of wild-type KIT. In KIT/D816V expressing mast cells, phosphorylation of Xkr5 inhibits KIT/D816V downstream signaling molecules Akt, Erk and p38. As a consequence, cell proliferation and colony formation are inhibited by the tyrosine phosphorylation of Xkr5 as well, indicating that Xkr5 is a negative regulator of KIT/D816V signaling.","title":"Xkr5 negatively regulates KIT/D816V signaling.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-2372"}
