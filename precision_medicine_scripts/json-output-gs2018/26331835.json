We report the feasibility of a tumor sequencing advisory board at a regional cancer center. Specimens were analyzed for approximately 2800 mutations in 50 genes. Outcomes of interest included tumor sequencing advisory board function and processes, timely discussion of results, and proportion of reports having potentially actionable mutations. NGS results were successfully generated for 15 patients, with median time from tissue processing to reporting of 11.6 days (range, 5 to 21 days), and presented at a biweekly multidisciplinary tumor sequencing advisory board. Attendance averaged 19 participants (range, 12 to 24) at 20 days after patient enrollment (range, 10 to 30 days). Twenty-seven (range, 1 to 4 per patient) potentially actionable mutations were detected in 11 of 15 patients: TP53 (n \u003d 6), KRAS (nÂ \u003d 4), MET (n \u003d 3), APC (n \u003d 3), CDKN2A (n \u003d 2), PTEN (n \u003d 2), PIK3CA, FLT3, NRAS, VHL, BRAF, SMAD4, and ATM. The Hotspot Panel is now offered as a clinically available test at our institution. NGS results can be obtained by in-house high-throughput sequencing and reviewed in a multidisciplinary tumor sequencing advisory board in a clinically relevant manner. The essential components of a center for personalized cancer care can support clinical decisions outside the university.
