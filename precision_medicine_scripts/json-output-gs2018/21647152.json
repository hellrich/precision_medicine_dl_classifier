To investigate the frequency of IDH1/2 mutations in pediatric AML, we characterized the mutational hotspot (exon 4) of these genes in diagnostic samples from 460 pediatric AML patients. Our analysis identified somatic IDH1/2 mutations in 4% of cases (IDH1 R132 n\u003d8; IDH2 R140 n\u003d10) and the minor allele of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11554137 in 47 children (10.2%). IDH mutations were associated with an intermediate age (P\u003d0.008), FAB M1/M2 (P\u003d0.013) and nucleophosmin1 mutations (P\u003d0.001). In univariate analysis, IDH(mutated) compared with IDH(wildtype) patients showed a significantly improved overall survival (OS; P\u003d0.032) but not event-free survival (EFS; P\u003d0.14). However, multivariate analysis did not show independent prognostic significance. Children with at least one minor allele of IDH1 SNP rs11554137 had similar EFS (P\u003d0.27) and OS (P\u003d0.62) compared with major allele patients. Gene expression profiles of 12 IDH(mutated) were compared with 201 IDH(wildtype) patients to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways. Although only a small number of discriminating genes were identified, analysis revealed a deregulated tryptophan metabolism, and a significant downregulation of KYNU expression in IDH(mutated) cases.","title":"Prevalence and prognostic value of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in childhood AML: a study of the AML-BFM and DCOG study groups.","pubmedId":"21647152"}
