Microscopically demonstrable lymphoreticuloendothelial responses, skin window tests, and leukocyte migration tests all indicate that tumor-specific antigenicity develops in assoication with the early phases of mammary carcinogenesis. Such antigenicity is maximally expressed in in situ carcinomas without associated invasive breast cancer and minimally in invasive breast cancers with metastases. Immunogenic breast cancer tissues commonly contain a protein component the antigenic and physicochemical properties of which are similar to those of a protein component of murine mammary tumor virus. Advances in our understanding and control of human mammary carcinogenesis and biological behavior are dependent on the clinicopathological characterization of individual patients and their breast tissues as well as on the analytical procedures used.","title":"Biological considerations of tumor-specific and virus-associated antigens of human breast cancers.","pubmedId":"175936"}
