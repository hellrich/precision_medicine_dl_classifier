In this study, we characterized the expression of Wnt pathway molecules in parathyroid benign and malignant tumors. Tumors were investigated by immunohistochemistry supplemented with Western blot analyses using monoclonal antibodies. The study comprised 13 tumors from 12 cases of unequivocal parathyroid carcinoma, 18 cases of parathyroid adenoma, as well as non-tumorous parathyroid tissue. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) was uniformly expressed in non-tumorous parathyroid tissue and adenomas, but absent in carcinomas from 9 of 12 patients (75%). Expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-beta) was lost in 4/12 carcinomas and in 1/18 adenomas. The loss of APC and GSK3-beta did not lead to augmentation of the Wnt target protein cyclin D1 or the Wnt oncoprotein beta-catenin. Active beta-catenin showed cytoplasmic and nuclear expression in all non-tumorous tissues and tumors. Loss of APC immunoreactivity was significantly associated with parathyroid carcinoma as compared to adenomas (p\u003c0.001), giving a high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (75%) for the detection of parathyroid malignancy. The results suggest the involvement of Wnt-pathway members APC and GSK3-beta in parathyroid carcinoma development. In addition, APC immunohistochemistry could become a useful tool for improved recognition of parathyroid carcinoma together with immunohistochemistry for parafibromin and proliferation index. Furthermore, the involvement of APC related pathways in the disease development opens possibilities to explore therapeutic routes complementary to surgery.","title":"Loss of expression for the Wnt pathway components adenomatous polyposis coli and glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta in parathyroid carcinomas.","pubmedId":"19148484"}
