The aim of this study was to review mouse models of differentiated thyroid cancer and how they elucidate human thyroid cancer biology.\nDifferentiated thyroid cancer, primarily papillary and follicular, comprises the majority of thyroid cancers. There has been tremendous growth in the cross-talk between basic science and clinical practice for thyroid cancer management. Insight into the framework of genes responsible for differentiated thyroid cancer has been gained through the use of mouse models. Common genetic alterations found in human papillary thyroid cancer such as RET/PTC rearrangements or the BRAF(V600E) mutation have genetically modified mouse counterparts. These and other preclinical mouse models have validated the importance of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). RAS mutations have a role in both papillary and follicular thyroid cancer development. Mice with overactivation of the phosphatidylinol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT and/or thyrotropin-regulated signaling pathways have been found to develop follicular thyroid cancer. Additional mouse models of thyroid cancer that utilize inducible expression systems are in development or are being characterized and will better reflect the majority of human thyroid cancers which are non-hereditary. Advances in in vivo imaging of mice allow for earlier detection of metastasis and the ability to follow tumor growth or regression which may be used in evaluation of pharmaceutical agents.\nMouse models have expanded our understanding of the altered signaling pathways that contribute to thyroid cancer tumorigenesis and provide a powerful tool to develop novel diagnostic approaches and therapies.","title":"Lessons from mouse models of thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"20001715"}
