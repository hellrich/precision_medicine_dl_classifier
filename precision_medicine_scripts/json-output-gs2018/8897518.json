The mitotic index was counted in 64 tumors. In 95% of the tumors p53 positive nuclei were detected, but in only 31% of the cases was the proportion of positive nuclei 3% or higher. The mitotic indices and the mean nuclear areas were not significantly different in melanomas with different p53 expression levels. The p53 positive nuclei had a larger mean nuclear area than the p53 negative nuclei. p53 expression did not increase with melanoma thickness. In Cox\u0027s stepwise proportional hazards model, the ratio of mean nuclear long and short axis and melanoma thickness had independent prognostic value, while the level of p53 expression, the mitotic index, and the mean nuclear area were not significantly associated with survival. We conclude that the nuclei expressing p53 protein are larger than p53 negative nuclei. The level of immunohistochemical expression of p53 is low in primary skin melanoma, and it is not valuable as a general prognostic marker for this tumor. p53 expression is not associated with melanoma thickness, indicating that high p53 expression is not a late phenomenon in the progression of this tumor.","title":"Immunohistochemical expression of p53 protein, mitotic index and nuclear morphometry in primary malignant melanoma of the skin.","pubmedId":"8897518"}
