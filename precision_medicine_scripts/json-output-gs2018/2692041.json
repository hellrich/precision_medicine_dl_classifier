New information about the vascular and neurophysiologic mechanisms of impotence have been joined by new technology to advance the medical practices in the diagnosing and treating of the impotent male. While similar advances have not occurred in the understanding of premature ejaculation, behavior therapy techniques are extremely effective with motivated couples. Primary care physicians can aid male patients with sexual dysfunction by attempting to identify them, initiating diagnostic and treatment programs, and referring patients for additional evaluations or specialized procedures when indicated.","title":"Male sexual dysfunction.","pubmedId":"2692041"}
