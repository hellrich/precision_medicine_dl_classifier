Histologically there were strands of characteristic basal cell type cells and, in addition, areas of squamous cell differentiation. The problem of \"epithelioma metatypique\" is discussed. The autopsy showed pure basal cell metastases in the lungs, the paraaortal lymph nodes and penetration of the tumor masses into the vena cava inferior. The unsufficient treatment by X-ray seems to be a conditioning factor by injuring the surrounding stroma.","title":"[Metastizing basalioma. A case contribution].","pubmedId":"873796"}
