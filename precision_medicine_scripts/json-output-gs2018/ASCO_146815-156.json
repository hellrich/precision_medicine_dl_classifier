T regulatory cells (Treg) create a protective microenviroment around pancreatic tumor cells that allows for immune evasion and limits the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4, downregulates Tregs and activates tumor specific T cells. Ipilimumab produced durable responses and overall survival benefit in metastatic melanoma patients. We report the final results of a dose finding study of gemcitabine and ipilimumab for APC. Methods:    Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was assessed during a 12 week induction cycle consisting of gemcitabine (750-1000 mg/m2) weekly for 7 weeks followed by one week off, then weekly for 3 weeks and ipilimumab (3-10 mg/kg) on weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Response was evaluated at 12 weeks by RECIST, mWHO criteria and immune-related response criteria (irRC). If deriving clinical benefit at 12 weeks, subjects continued gemcitabine 3 weeks on with one week off and ipilimumab at the assigned dose every 12 weeks starting at week 22.  Results:  As of January 1, 2015, 13 subjects with APC were enrolled and evaluable for toxicity. The median age is 64 years (45-83), ECOG PS 0-1, 9 received prior therapy for advanced disease. Two subjects had DLTs at a dose of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and ipilimumab 6 mg/kg (grade 3 hepatotoxicity and grade 3 diarrhea), which exceeded the maximally tolerated dose (MTD). The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were thrombocytopenia (10), leukopenia (9), neutropenia (8), anemia (8), and fatigue (8). Grade 3-4 related AEs occurred in 9 subjects, most commonly neutropenia (6), anemia (4), leukopenia (3), thrombocytopenia (2) and nausea (2). 11 subjects were evaluable for response by RECIST criteria. Partial response was seen in 2 pts (15%) and stable disease in 5 pts (38%), distributed among all cohorts. Conclusions:  The MTD is ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2. DLT is immune related hepatotoxicity and diarrhea. The most common toxicities are hematologic. Markers of immune response will be reported. An expansion phase of the combination is ongoing.
