Over-expression of Aurora kinases is found in several human cancers and correlated with histological malignancy and clinical outcomes. Therefore, Aurora kinase inhibitors should be useful in the treatment of cancers.\nCell-based screening methods have an advantage over biochemical approaches because hits can be optimized to inhibit targets in the proper intracellular context. We developed a novel Aurora kinase inhibitor R763/AS703569 using an image-based phenotypic screen. The anti-proliferative effect was examined in a panel of tumor cell lines and primary cells. The efficacy was determined in a broad panel of xenograft models.\nR763/AS703569 inhibits Aurora kinases, along with a limited number of other kinases including FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), and has potent anti-proliferative activity against many cell types accompanying unique phenotypic changes such as enlarged cell size, endoreduplication and apoptosis. The endoreduplication cycle induced by R763/AS703569 was irreversible even after the compound was withdrawn from the culture. Oral administration of R763/AS703569 demonstrated marked inhibition of tumor growth in xenograft models of pancreatic, breast, colon, ovarian, and lung tumors and leukemia. An acute myeloid leukemia cell line MV4-11, which carries a FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation, is particularly sensitive to R763/AS703569 in vivo.\nR763/AS703569 is a potent inhibitor of Aurora kinases and exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity against a wide range of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of Aurora kinases has the potential to be a new addition to the treatment of cancers.","title":"Preclinical characterization of Aurora kinase inhibitor R763/AS703569 identified through an image-based phenotypic screen.","pubmedId":"19609559"}
