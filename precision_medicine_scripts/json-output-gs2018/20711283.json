Especially, recent studies have identified an association between cutaneous malignant melanoma and thyroid carcinoma. We here report on a case of cutaneous malignant melanoma that developed in a 61-year-old female patient who had hypothyroidism caused by papillary thyroid carcinoma. We suggest that the individuals who have cutaneous malignant melanoma may be predisposed to other primary cancers and especially thyroid carcinoma. Continuous monitoring of the thyroid function in melanoma patients is required because hypothyroidism can worsen due to malignant melanoma and this is probably associated with thyroid carcinoma.","title":"Cutaneous malignant melanoma associated with papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"20711283"}
