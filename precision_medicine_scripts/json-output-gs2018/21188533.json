In this report, we examined effect of the XPA -4G\u003eA, XPD Asp312Asn, Leu751Gln, hHR23B Ala249Val, XPG Asp1104His, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, XRCC2 -4234G\u003eC and XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphisms on overall survival in 162 patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The XRCC3 Met/Met genotype was significantly associated with increased risk of death among all patients and men in uni- and multivariate analyses. The risk was higher for adenocarcinoma patients possessing the XRCC3 Met/Met or XRCC1 Gln/Gln genotypes, although their frequency was small. The XRCC1 399Gln allele was also associated with poor prognosis in stage II-IIIA and among older individuals. Men homozygous for the XPD 312 Asn/Asn had significantly better survival with the risk of death being at borderline significance in uni- and multivariate models. Younger cases and ever smokers smoking less than median pack-years showed significantly increased risk of death associated with the XPA -4A allele. A presence of one or two XRCC2 -4234C alleles had a protective effect in males and ever smokers with lower cumulative smoking dose, although the CC genotype was rarely observed. When number of combined risk alleles was considered, we found that carriers of \u003e4 adverse alleles were at significantly increased risk of death in uni- and multivariate models. Therefore, our results indicate that selected genetic polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may influence overall survival in resected NSCLC.","title":"An association between DNA repair gene polymorphisms and survival in patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21188533"}
