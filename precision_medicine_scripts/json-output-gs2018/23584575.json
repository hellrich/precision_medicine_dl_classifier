From the discovery of BRAF mutation in melanoma in 2002, to the approval of first BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib for melanoma treatment by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2011, therapies targeting the MAPK pathway have been proven effective in less than a decade. The success of vemurafenib stimulated more intensive investigation of the molecular mechanisms of melanoma pathogenesis and development of new treatment strategies targeting specific molecules in MAPK pathway. Although selective BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors demonstrated improved overall survival of metastatic melanoma patients, limited duration or development of resistance to BRAF inhibitors have been reported. Patients with metastatic melanoma still face very poor prognosis and lack of clarified therapies. Studies and multiple clinical trials on more potent and selective small molecule inhibitory compounds to further improve the clinical effects and overcome drug resistance are underway. In this review, we analyzed the therapeutic potentials of each member of the MAPK signaling pathway, summarized important MAPK-inhibiting drugs, and discussed the promising combination treatment targeting multiple targets in melanoma therapy, which may overcome the drawbacks of current drugs treatment.
