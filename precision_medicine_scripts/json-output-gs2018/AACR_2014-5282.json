Additionally, some recent papers reported somatic mutations of PPP6c gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of PP6, in about 10 % of melanoma patients, suggesting its potential role as either driver or suppressor of melanoma development.In this study, we generated mice, in which the PPP6C gene is deleted in keratinocyte-specific manner (PP6-KKO). PP6-KKO mice were predisposed to formation of skin tumor upon DMBA-treatment. Our results demonstrate PPP6c has a tumor-suppressive function at least in skin tumorigenesis.","title":"Promotion of skin tumorigenesis by deletion of Ppp6c gene","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-5282"}
