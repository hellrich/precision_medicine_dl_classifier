However, it is unknown whether pretreatment with antiangiogenic therapy could impact on the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy. We selected one hundred and twenty eight patients diagnosed with advanced colorectal cancer with a KRAS and NRAS unmutated tumor. These patients were treated with cetuximab or panitumumab alone or with chemotherapy as second or third-line. Univariate and multivariate Cox model analysis were performed to estimate the effect of a previous bevacizumab regimen on progression free survival and on overall survival during anti-EGFR therapy. In vitro studies using wild type KRAS and NRAS colon cancer cells were performed to evaluate the impact of VEGF-A on cetuximab-induced cell death. The median progression free survival (PFS) during anti-EGFR treatment was significantly different between the bevacizumab group and the non-bevacizumab group (2.8 and 4 months respectively; p \u003d 0.003). The median overall survival from the beginning of the metastatic disease was similar in the two groups (41.3 and 42 months respectively; p \u003d 0.7). In vitro, VEGF-A induced a resistance toward cetuximab cytotoxicity on three KRAS and NRAS wild type colon cancer cell lines in a VEGFR2 and Stat-3-dependent manner. All in all, our clinical data, supported by in vitro procedures, suggest that a previous anti-VEGF therapy decreases anti-EGFR efficacy. Although these results are observed in a limited cohort, they could be taken into consideration for a better strategy of care for patient suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer.","title":"Does bevacizumab impact anti-EGFR therapy efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer?","pubmedId":"26824184"}
