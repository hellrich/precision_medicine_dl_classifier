For mucosal melanoma, anorectum was the most common anatomic site (n\u003d39, 30.2%) which was followed by nasal cavity (n\u003d30, 23.3%), genitourinary (n\u003d21, 16.3%), oral cavity (n\u003d14, 10.9%), upper gastrointestinal tract (n\u003d6, 4.7%) and maxillary sinus (n\u003d5, 3.9%) in the order of frequency. With the median 64.5 (range 4.3-213.0) months follow-up, the median overall survival were 24.4 months (95% CI 13.2-35.5) for all patients, and 34.6 (95% CI 24.5-44.7) months for curatively resected mucosal melanoma patients. Adverse prognostic factors of survival for 87 curatively resected mucosal melanoma patients were complete resection (R1 resection margin), and age\u003e50 years. For 14 ocular melanoma, Survival outcome was much better than mucosal melanoma with 73.3% of 2 year OS and 51.2 months of median OS (P\u003d.04).\nPrognosis differed according to primary sites of noncutaneous melanoma. Based on our study, noncutaneous melanoma patients should be treated differently to improve survival outcome.","title":"Noncutaneous malignant melanoma: a prognostic model from a retrospective multicenter study.","pubmedId":"20426858"}
