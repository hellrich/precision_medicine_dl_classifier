Selective BRAF inhibitors may play a role in the treatment of BM, but data from the real-world setting is limited. This study aimed to investigate treatment and survival patterns among BRAFV600E mM pts with active BM receiving vemurafenib (vem).  Methods:  Clinical data for BRAFV600E mM pts with active BM treated with vem after 8/2011 were reviewed from a panel of US oncologists. Demographic and clinical characteristics, mM treatment history pre- and post- vem, treatment response, and death were recorded.  6-month survival rate was estimated using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method. Prognostic factors for death were measured prior to vem initiation and assessed using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model.  Results:  283 BRAFV600E mM pts who received vem after diagnosis (dx) of BM were analyzed. Mean age was 57 years; 60.8% were male; 67.5% were ECOG 0-1. Median follow-up time from vem initiation was 5.7 months.  Prior to vem, 109 (38.5%) pts received local treatment and 23 (8.1%) pts received systemic treatment for BM. Median vem treatment duration among pts who discontinued vem was 5.0 months. 21 (7.4%) pts required a dose reduction of vem.  Reasons for vem discontinuation included systemic disease progression (42.9%), intracranial progression (18.1%), death (16.4%), and pt decision (5.6%). 136/283 (48.1%) were reported to achieve overall intracranial response (CR/PR).  No new safety issues were identified. K-M survival at 6-month was 85.7% (95% CI: 80.1, 89.8).  Pts with 5 BM (HR 3.8; 95% CI: 1.7, 8.5), progressive extracranial metastases (HR 2.6; 95% CI: 1.4, 4.6), and 2 sites of extracranial metastases (HR 5.3; 95% CI: 1.4, 20.4) were found to be significant prognostic factors for death.  Conclusions:  In the real world setting, the use of vem treatment is associated with clinical benefit in BRAFV600E mM patients with active BM.","title":"Treatment patterns and outcomes in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma patients with brain metastases receiving vemurafenib in the real-world setting.","pubmedId":"ASCO_131583-144"}
