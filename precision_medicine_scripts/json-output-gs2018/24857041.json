It was approved by the US FDA on 30 January 2012, and by the European Commission on 12 July 2013, for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic metastatic BCC, or locally advanced BCC inappropriate for surgery or radiotherapy. Vismodegib selectively inhibits the Hh signaling pathway, binding to and inhibiting a critical signal-transducing component of the pathway, Smoothened (SMO). Vismodegib was discovered by Genentech, Inc., under a collaboration agreement with Curis, Inc.\nThis article reviews the development of vismodegib from its discovery, preclinical pharmacology and validation to the clinical pharmacokinetics and validation in Phase I and II clinical investigations. We also provide a survey of other Hh pathway inhibitors in clinical development.\nThe authors\u0027 experience in target-based drug discovery suggests that vismodegib\u0027s path to the clinic deserves some reflection to identify key steps that have contributed to its success. Targeting the Hh pathway with vismodegib blocks the abberant signaling caused by mutational inactivation of the negative regulator PTCH1 or mutational activation of SMO. Vismodegib gives physicians a treatment option for patients with locally advanced or metastatic BCC for whom surgery or radiation is not recommended.","title":"Discovery and preclinical development of vismodegib.","pubmedId":"24857041"}
