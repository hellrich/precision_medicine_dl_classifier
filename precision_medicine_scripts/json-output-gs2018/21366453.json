Special characteristics of melanoma in children are discussed, regarding clinical settings and risk factors, helpful histologic features, and immunohistochemical patterns for diagnosis and prognosis.\nCareful analysis of histologic features as well as the additional information provided by immunohistochemistry should allow for a correct diagnosis in most cases of melanoma in children. Although it seems that pediatric patients with melanoma have higher survival probability than adults, still a number of children will develop metastasis and die of their disease, particularly when melanoma is diagnosed after puberty. Until further studies more accurately determine the prognosis, a prudent approach to CMC diagnosis and therapy seems to follow the same principles as those established for adult melanoma.","title":"Melanoma in children.","pubmedId":"21366453"}
