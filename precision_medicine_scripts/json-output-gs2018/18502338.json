An activating germline RET proto-oncogene mutation responsible for a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2) or a familial hereditary MTC syndrome is carried by 25% to 35% of patients with MTC. The recognition of RET proto-oncogene mutations by genetic sequencing has allowed us to differentiate hereditary from sporadic MTC, so that it is now possible to identify and treat children at risk for this disease before development of metastasis. Thanks to this discovery, we can now establish the association of MTC with other tumors in the context of MEN2 syndrome; determine adequate follow-up, prognosis, and treatment for patients with hereditary disease; and use this information to develop new therapies against both sporadic and hereditary MTCs.","title":"Management of medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"18502338"}
