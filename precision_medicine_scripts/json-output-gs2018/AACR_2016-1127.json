Although KITD816V has been found in melanoma, its function and involvement in this malignancy is not understood. Here we show that KITD816V induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) through a triple protein complex formation between KIT, MITF and SRC family kinases. In turn, phosphorylated MITF activates target genes that are involved in melanoma proliferation, cell cycle progression, suppression of senescence, survival and invasion. By blocking the triple protein complex formation, thus preventing MITF phosphorylation, the cells become hypersensitive to SRC inhibitors. We have therefore delineated the mechanism behind the oncogenic effects of KITD816V in melanoma and provide a rationale for testing SRC family kinase inhibitors to treat KITD816V-transformed melanomas.","title":"KIT/D816V induces SRC-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of MITF and altered transcription program in melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1127"}
