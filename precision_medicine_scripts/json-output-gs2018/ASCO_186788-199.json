NTRK point mutations are rare and of largely uninvestigated oncogenic potential, but some appear oncogenic. Methods: Advanced thyroid cancer (TC) patients (pts) requiring systemic therapy at Mayo Clinic sites underwent tumor genetic interrogation using Foundation One analyses with the goal of informing salvage therapeutic strategies. In this IRB-approved study, data from pts with TCs bearing NTRK point mutations were retrospectively analyzed, as this occurrence was unexpected but potentially of prognostic and/or therapeutic relevance. Results: Five of 55 pts (9%) with advanced TCs subject to Foundation One tumor interrogation had NTRK1-3 point mutations (allele frequency, AF, 15-49%); none had fusions. All 5 tumors had microsatellite stability; 4/5 had low tumor mutation burden (2-5 mutations/megabase). NTRK mutations in 3 anaplastic TC (ATC) pts (15% prevalence) were: NTRK3 I749M (AF 15%; overall survival, OS, 15 mos), NTRK1 R744H (AF not available; OS 9.5 mos), and NTRK1 R583H (AF 20.1%; OS \u003e 4.9 mos); NTRK2 S167Y (AF 49%; OS \u003e 51 mos) or NTRK1 R6W (AF 42%; OS \u003e 60 mos) were found in one papillary (PTC) and one Hrthle cell (HCC) TC pt respectively (summary table below). Conclusions:NTRK point mutations, but not fusions, were unexpectedly identified in 9% of assessed advanced TCs - but remarkably in 15% of ATCs. Mutated NTRKs, along with oncogenic p53 and TERT, may contribute to TC progression, especially in ATC, consequent to downstream activation of MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. We posit that NTRK point mutations may have therapeutic implications for treatment of refractory disease.
