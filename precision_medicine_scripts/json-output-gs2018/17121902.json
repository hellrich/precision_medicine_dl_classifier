VEGF blockade was achieved by using a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector expressing a soluble VEGF receptor consisting of selected domains of the VEGF receptors 1 and 2 (termed sVEGFR1/R2). Dendritic cell and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte activation status and numbers were evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Regulatory T cells were quantified by their CD4+CD25hi and CD4+FoxP3+ phenotype.\nThe present study established that GM-CSF-secreting tumor cell immunotherapy with VEGF blockade significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Enhanced anti-tumor protection correlated with an increased number of activated CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells and a pronounced decrease in the number of suppressive regulatory T cells residing in the tumor. Conversely, overexpression of VEGF from tumors resulted in elevated numbers of regulatory T cells in the tumor, suggesting a novel mechanism of VEGF-mediated immune suppression at the tumor site.\nGM-CSF-secreting cancer immunotherapy and VEGF blockade increases the i.t. ratio of effector to regulatory T cells to provide enhanced antitumor responses. This therapeutic combination may prove to be an effective strategy for the treatment of patients with cancer.","title":"Vascular endothelial growth factor blockade reduces intratumoral regulatory T cells and enhances the efficacy of a GM-CSF-secreting cancer immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"17121902"}
