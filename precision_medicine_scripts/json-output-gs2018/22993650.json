Excessive activation of BRAF/MAPK signaling pathway due to BRAF mutation plays a central role in the tumorigenesis and development of PTC. The association of BRAF mutation with poor clinicopathological characteristics of PTC further demonstrated the importance of the BRAF mutation alternation in PTC. Detection of BRAF mutation on FNA specimen before surgery is recommended as a useful diagnostic marker and prognostic indicator for PTC, and thus influences surgeon\u0027s decision on management of PTC. Recent studies have focused on inhibition of BRAF activation and several small molecules have been developed as targeting therapy.","title":"BRAF mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"22993650"}
