We developed an evidence-based utilization model to estimate the optimal proportion of new cases of cancer where chemotherapy is indicated at least once as a benchmark for measuring and improving the quality of care. Methods: We constructed an optimal chemotherapy utilization model using indications for chemotherapy identified from evidence-based treatment guidelines. Population-based data on the proportion of patient and tumor-related attributes for which chemotherapy was indicated were obtained from Australian cancer registries where possible. Treatment indications and epidemiological data were merged using TreeAge Pro 2007 to calculate the optimal rate. Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses were used to assess the impact of controversial chemotherapy indications and variations in epidemiological data on our model. Results: Chemotherapy was indicated at least once in 50.8% (95% CI 50.6-51%) of all new cancer patients. The optimal chemotherapy utilization rates by tumor sites ranged from a low of 13% in thyroid cancers to a high of 94% in myeloma. Conclusions: Our model generates an optimal chemotherapy utilization rate that can function as a valuable evidence-based benchmark against which patterns of care data on chemotherapy utilization may be compared. The actual chemotherapy utilization rate appears to be substantially lower than the optimal rate in most tumor sites (except for liver cancer) suggesting that chemotherapy may be underutilized in cancer treatment.
