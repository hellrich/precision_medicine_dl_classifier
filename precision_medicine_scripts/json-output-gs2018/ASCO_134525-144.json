Recent data indicate that PD-L1 tumor status might be predictive for responses to PD-1- and PD-L1- directed therapies.  Methods:    PD-L1 expression was evaluated in genomically annotated 259 adenocarcinomas (AD) and 180 squamous cell carcinomas of the lung (SQ) using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Moreover, PD-L1 expression and its correlation with clinical data, histology and genotype were analyzed.  Results:    Tumors were considered PD-L1 positive if tumor cells showed at least weak membranous staining by IHC. 83 of 259 patients (pts.) with AD were positive for PD-L1 surface expression (\u003d32,0%). The observed staining intensity was weak, intermediate and strong in 38, 33 and 12 cases respectively. 55 of 180 pts. with SQ were PD-L1+(\u003d30,6%). The observed staining intensity was weak, intermediate and strong in 27, 21 and 7 cases respectively. For AD and SQ no significant association between PD-L1 expression and clinical characteristics (gender, smoking history, stage) could be found. PD-L1 expression in AD or SQ was not significantly associated with ALK translocation (n\u003d178; n\u003d138), BRAF mutation (mut.) (n\u003d113; n\u003d98), DDR2 mut. (n\u003d59; n\u003d64), EGFR mut. (n\u003d124; n\u003d101), FGFR2 mut. (n\u003d 117; n\u003d91), HRAS mut. (n\u003d94; n\u003d73), KRAS mut. (SQ, n\u003d101), NFE2L2_exon2 mut. (AD, n\u003d97), NRAS mut. (n\u003d109; n\u003d81), PIK3CA mut. (n\u003d121; n\u003d99), STK11 mut. (SQ, n\u003d101), TP53 mut. (n\u003d124; n\u003d101) or RB1 deletion (SQ, n\u003d109). However, PD-L1 expression in AD is significantly more frequent in KRAS mutated than in KRAS wild-type samples (n\u003d126; p\u003d0,002) and significantly more frequent in samples with deletion of RB1 (n\u003d143; p\u003d0,024). On the contrary, PD-L1 expression in AD is significantly less frequent in samples with STK11 mutations (n\u003d122; p\u003d0,022). Finally, PD-L1 expression in SQ is significantly more frequent in samples with a mutation in exon 2 of NFE2L2 (n\u003d88; p\u003d0,025).  Conclusions:    PD-L1 expression in the two most common histological NSCLC subtypes is associated with distinct genotypes that might further facilitate identification of pts. most suitable for therapeutic anti PD-1 and anti PD-L1 intervention.","title":"PD-L1 expression and genotype in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_134525-144"}
