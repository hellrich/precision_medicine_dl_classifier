Many of these mutations, including mutations in the C-terminus of the large intracellular loop (ICL) of ptch1 (p.C727VfsX745 and p.S733IfsX736), result in the premature truncation of the protein. The ptch1‑C727VfsX745 and ptch1-S733IfsX736 mutations have been identified in patients with NBCCS‑associated keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs). In the present study, we found that the molecular mechanisms regulated by the non-canonical Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway through cyclin B1 are involved in the pathogenesis of NBCCS-associated KCOTs. In contrast to wild-type ptch1, ptch1-C727VfsX745 and ptch1‑S733IfsX736 clearly exhibited reduced binding to cyclin B1. Moreover, the cells expressing these two mutations demonstrated an increase in cell cycle progression and these two mutation constructs failed to inhibit cell proliferation. In addition, the mutants enhanced the activity of glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 1 (GLI1), a downstream reporter of Hh signaling. Thus, our data suggest that the non-canonical Hh pathway mediated through ptch1 and cyclin B1 is involved in the pathogenesis of NBCCS-associated KCOTs. The C-terminus of ICL in ptch1 may also be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of this disease.","title":"The large intracellular loop of ptch1 mediates the non-canonical Hedgehog pathway through cyclin B1 in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.","pubmedId":"24840883"}
