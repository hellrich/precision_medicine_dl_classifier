This platform has enabled researchers to characterize mechanisms central to tumorigenesis and understand important molecular events in the multi-step tumor progression model of cutaneous melanoma and other cancers. In melanoma, multiple global gene expression profiling studies using various DNA microarray platforms and various experimental designs have been performed. Each study has been able to capture and characterize either the involvement of a novel pathway or a novel cause-effect-relationship. The use of microarrays to define subclasses, to identify differentially regulated genes within a mutational context to analyze epigenetically regulated genes has resulted in an unprecedented understanding of the biology of cutaneous melanoma that may lead to more accurate diagnosis, more comprehensive prognosis, prediction and more effective therapeutic interventions. Related DNA microarray platforms like array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) have also been instrumental to identify many non-random chromosomal alterations; however, studies identifying validated targets as a result of CGH are limited. Thus, there exists significant opportunity to discover novel melanoma genes and translate such discoveries into meaningful clinical endpoints. In this review, we focus on various DNA microarray-based studies performed in cutaneous melanoma and summarize our current understanding of the genetics and biology of melanoma progression derived from accumulating genomic information.","title":"Cutaneous melanoma: fishing with chips.","pubmedId":"18473822"}
