Several studies have consistently shown a significant association between the presence of BRAFV600E mutation and resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy in pts with previously treated mCRC while there are few reports on the clinical impact of minor BRAF mutations.  Methods:  The BREAC trial was a multicenter, retrospective study to investigate the novel biomarkers of anti-EGFR antibody therapy. RAS and BRAF mutations were detected by targeted sequencing using FFPE materials of mCRC pts who received anti-EGFR antibody after a failure to standard therapies. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response rate (RR) were evaluated according to expanded RAS/BRAF mutational status.  Results:  Of 184 pts enrolled in the study, RAS/BRAF testing was succeeded in 150 pts. Patients characteristics were as follows; male/female 87/63, median age 63.5 years (range, 28-85), PS 0/1/2 81/65/4. Median PFS, OS, and RR were 4.0 months, 12.4 months, and 21%, respectively. Expanded RAS and BRAF mutations were detected in 40 pts (26.7%, KRAS/NRAS 29/11) and in 16 pts (10.7%, BRAFV600E/other 9/7), respectively. Observed BRAF mutations other than BRAFV600E were located at kinase domain. The clinical outcomes of other BRAF mutations were worse similar to those of BRAFV600E and expanded RAS mutations (Table).  Conclusions:  Expanded BRAF mutations might predict a lack of response for mCRC pts who received anti-EGFR antibody. Further investigation is warranted to confirm the clinical impact of expanded BRAF mutations.
