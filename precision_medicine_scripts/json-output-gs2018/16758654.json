It has recently been shown to be associated with germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. Genetic testing for RET mutations will, therefore allow the identification of people with asymptomatic MEN 2 who can be offered prophylactic thyroidectomy and biochemical screening as preventive measures. No genetic study based on RET mutation detection has been available in India so far. The aim of the present study is to detect the proportion of MTC cases having inherited germline or somatic RET mutations and to identify family members at risk for MEN and, thereby the feasibility of screening for MEN. DNA extracted from the peripheral blood and somatic (tumor) tissues were subjected to PCR using primers for exons 10,11 and 16. A few samples were subjected to direct sequencing. Germline mutations were identified in 3 of 4 MEN 2A patients, 18 of 24 sporadic MTC(SMTC), 2 of 4 children of MEN2A and 8 relatives of SMTC. Common mutation was in exon 10 and 11 (c634). It is recommended that RET mutation analysis and counseling of patients and their immediate relatives be introduced on a regular basis to identify gene carriers.","title":"RET mutation status in medullary thyroid cancer(MTC) patients and the significance of genetic screening for mutations in their immediate relatives--a preliminary report.","pubmedId":"16758654"}
