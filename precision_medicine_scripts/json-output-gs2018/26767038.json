There is evidence that crizotinib can be used for molecular target therapy in these patients. We enrolled the patient in an off-label program for the treatment of ROS1 rearranged adenocarcinomas with the EML4/anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor crizotinib. After a follow-up of eight weeks we saw a complete remission in both lungs without any signs of metabolic tumor activity. This report shows the importance of testing young patients with adenocarcinomas of the lung for rare oncogenic driver mutations, such as ROS1, with possible molecular treatment options.
