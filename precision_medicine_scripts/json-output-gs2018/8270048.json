Beside the 59 breast cancer cases four tumours of other histologic type were also detected. As to surgical treatment, in addition to mastectomy, the axillary block dissection is regarded as important in each case. The prognosis is mainly determined by the time elapsed until treatment and by the lymph node status. The mean survival of the axillary node negative patients was 116 months, compared to that of 38.9 months found in axillary node positive cases. Metastases were the soonest detected 2 years following surgery, altogether in 36 cases (61%). Local recurrence developed in eight patients (14%). Steroid hormone receptor investigations have been performed since 1980; of the 27 patients examined estrogen receptor positivity was seen in 25 cases. The hormone receptor study of the tumour and the assessment of the hormonal status of the patient provide valuable information for the treatment. In case of tumour progression the life of the patient might considerably be prolonged by combined hormone and cytostatic therapy.","title":"Male breast tumours.","pubmedId":"8270048"}
