The area was excised and examined histologically 6 weeks after cessation of imiquimod cream.\nAll 17 lesions (100%) showed no histologic evidence of residual tumor on the post-treatment excision. Local site reactions necessitating a rest period from medication application were experienced by most patients (67%), but the majority of patients stated that they would choose this treatment modality over excision if they developed a subsequent tumor.\nImiquimod 5% cream appears to be an effective treatment method for nodular basal cell carcinoma if combined with curettage prior to application.","title":"Pilot study using topical imiquimod 5% cream in the treatment of nodular basal cell carcinoma after initial treatment with curettage.","pubmedId":"17941362"}
