Further, infiltration of macrophages is closely correlated with the depth of tumor and angiogenesis in melanomas. In this study, we examined the expression of TP and an activated macrophage-specific enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), involved in malignancy in 22 cases with melanomas. TP was strongly expressed not only in CD68-positive macrophages in and around tumors, but also in S100 protein-positive melanoma cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes. By contrast, HO-1 was specifically expressed in macrophages, but only slightly in melanoma cells and other cell types in the stroma of melanomas. We thus observed apparent co-expression of TP and HO-1 in macrophages infiltrating in the late stage of malignant melanomas. There appeared increasing numbers of TP-positive cells in Clark level IV and V melanoma compared with Clark level I (in situ) melanoma, and there was also a close correlation between numbers of TP-positive cells and HO-1-positive cells. Both TP- and HO-1-positive macrophages could be observed in the stroma in and around tumors in vertical growth melanomas.","title":"Co-expression of thymidine phosphorylase and heme oxygenase-1 in macrophages in human malignant vertical growth melanomas.","pubmedId":"11011118"}
