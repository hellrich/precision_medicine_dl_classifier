All three animals had severe muscle disease as evidenced by markedly increased aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase activities. Laboratory error was suspected as the source of the increased HCO3- because values calculated from blood gas analysis were normal. It was hypothesized that increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and pyruvate concentration overwhelmed the oxamate LDH inhibitor in the enzymatic HCO3- assay, resulting in consumption of NADH and falsely elevated spectrophotometric reading. Serum LDH activity was markedly increased in all three patients. In an attempt to reproduce this interference in vitro, LDH and pyruvate were added to normal bovine serum. Bicarbonate concentration was artifactually increased in a linear, dose-response relationship proportional to the amount of LDH activity in the sample; addition of pyruvate augmented this increase. It was concluded that increased serum LDH activity and pyruvate concentration secondary to severe muscle disease can result in artifactual increases in serum HCO3- values obtained by routine enzymatic assay.","title":"Artifactually increased serum bicarbonate values in two horses and a calf with severe rhabdomyolysis.","pubmedId":"12075544"}
