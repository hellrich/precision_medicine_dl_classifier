We developed a high-information-content mass spectrometry approach to profile global histone modifications in human cancers. When applied to 115 lines of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia1, this approach identified distinct molecular chromatin signatures. One signature was characterized by increased H3K36 dimethylation, exhibited by several lines harboring NSD2 translocations. A novel NSD2 p.E1099K variant was identified in non-translocated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) lines sharing this signature. Ectopic expression of the variant induced a chromatin signature characteristic of NSD2 hyperactivation and promoted transformation. NSD2 knockdown selectively inhibited the proliferation of NSD2-mutant lines and impaired the in vivo growth of an NSD2-mutant ALL xenograft. Sequencing analysis of \u003e1000 pediatric cancer genomes identified the NSD2 p.E1099K mutation in 14% of t(12;21)[ETV6-RUNX1]-containing ALLs. These findings identify NSD2 as a potential therapeutic target for pediatric ALL and provide a general framework for the functional annotation of cancer epigenomes.1.Barretina,J. et al.
