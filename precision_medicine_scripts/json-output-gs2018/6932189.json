Patients with Hodgkin\u0027s disease, non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, blastic crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia were found to have significantly elevated serum ferritin levels. Further study of serum ferritin concentration in certain hematologic malignant neoplasms might provide a valuable insight into the role of serum ferritin determination in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with malignant diseases.","title":"Serum ferritin levels in hematologic malignant neoplasms.","pubmedId":"6932189"}
