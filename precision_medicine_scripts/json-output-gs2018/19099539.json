Furthermore, genetic markers that may predict the outcome of targeted pharmacological intervention in an individual are central to patient-focused treatment regimens rather than the traditional \u0027one size fits all\u0027 approach. Prostate cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease in which a patient-tailored care program is a holy grail. This review will describe the evidence that demonstrates the integration of three established pathways: the tumour-suppressive TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) pathway, the tumorigenic PI3K/Akt (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B) pathway and the tumour-suppressive PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) pathway. It will discuss gene polymorphisms and somatic mutations in relevant genes and highlight novel pharmaceutical agents that target key points in these integrated pathways.","title":"The TGF-beta, PI3K/Akt and PTEN pathways: established and proposed biochemical integration in prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"19099539"}
