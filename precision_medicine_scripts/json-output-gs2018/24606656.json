Microparticles (MP) were extracted from the peripheral blood. Real-time PCR was performed to measure the level of BCR-ABL mRNA.\nBCR-ABL mRNA could be stably detected both in MP and peripheral blood cells; BCR-ABL in MP showed significant difference within complete molecular response, major molecular response and complete cytogenetic response (9.1±2.8, 25.2±6.9 and 62.8±6.3 respectively, P\u003c0.05). BCR-ABL was detected in MP even when it was negative in peripheral blood cells (3.7-15.3). For patients with complete molecular response, BCR-ABL in MP but not cells were significantly different between imatinib and stem cell transplant recipients (3.3±2.1 vs 9.1±2.8, P\u003c0.05).\nThis study indicated that MP may serves as a new target for monitoring of CML. Quantification of BCR-ABL in MP may offer a novel strategy for stratification of molecular response.","title":"[Detection of leukemia-derived microparticles in the monitoring of chronic myeloid leukemia].","pubmedId":"24606656"}
