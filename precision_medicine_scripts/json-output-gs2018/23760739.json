The greatest difference between the CCI curves at 5 years after initiating imatinib therapy was observed for the BCR-ABL1 transcripts at 3 months. The 5-year CCI was 94.3% in patients with BCR-ABL1 transcripts ≤ 10% and 57.1% in patients with BCR-ABL1 transcripts \u003e 10% (P \u003d 0.005). Therefore, the examination of BCR-ABL1 transcripts at 3 months may help in early identification of patients who are likely to perform poorly with imatinib. On the other hand, CLFS was not significantly affected by the considered stratifications. In conclusion, our results indicate that once the CCgR is achieved, the prognosis is good irrespective of the starting prognostic risks.","title":"Current survival measures reliably reflect modern sequential treatment in CML: correlation with prognostic stratifications.","pubmedId":"23760739"}
