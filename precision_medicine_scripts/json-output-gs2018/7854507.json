The total number of patients with intracranial tumour treated in the period concerned was 594, so the incidence of tumour haemorrhage was 2.7%. In most of the patients we found metastatic neoplasm (n \u003d 6) and glioblastoma (n \u003d 3). All patients were acute admissions. Seven were comatose, seven were somnolent, and two patients were alert. In ten patients the haemorrhage represented the first reliable clinical sign. In six patients a tumour disease was known. Fourteen patients were operated on. Six patients died. Extensive neuro-radiological examination is very important, particularly since 30% of these acute intracerebral haemorrhages occur in patients with benign intracranial tumours.","title":"[Intracerebral hematoma as an acute manifestation of intracranial tumors].","pubmedId":"7854507"}
