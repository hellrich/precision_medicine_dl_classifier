The importance of proteolysis and especially plasminogen activation is less clear in hematopoietic malignancies than in solid tumors. However, patients with leukemia have an increased tendency to bleeding, not always attributable to thrombocytopenia, and tissue infiltration by leukemic cells, processes in which plasminogen activation may be involved. Several studies have indicated that plasminogen activators (PAs) are highly expressed by cultured leukemia cells. Furthermore, differing from adherent tumor cells, leukemic cells have an enhanced capacity to activate pro-uPA and mainly the active form of uPA is released to culture medium. Ex vivo studies have shown that uPAR, uPA and its inhibitors can be found on the surface of normal blood cells and on the blast cell surfaces from patients with acute leukemia as well as from plasma samples. Elevated levels of PAs and their inhibitors have been detected in leukemic cell lysates. Few studies have tried to demonstrate a correlation between prognosis of leukemia and levels of plasminogen activators. More in vivo studies are needed to show, if any of the factors of the plasminogen activation process can be used as tools in subclassification or as markers for prognosis in leukemia. This review article will focus on the in vivo studies of plasminogen activation in leukemia and will present several in vitro findings on PAs in normal leukocytes and leukemic cell lines.","title":"Plasminogen activation in human leukemia and in normal hematopoietic cells.","pubmedId":"10190291"}
