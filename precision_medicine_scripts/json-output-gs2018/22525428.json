We validated those results in an independent set of nevi and melanomas by quantitative RT-PCR. miR-205 demonstrated a statistically significant, progressive diminution in expression from nevi to primary melanomas to metastatic melanomas. Enforced miR-205 expression in melanoma cells profoundly impairs cell motility and migration along with significantly decreased F-actin polymerization with only a modest reduction in cell proliferation. Using a xenograft model, melanoma cells overexpressing miR-205 exhibit a reduced migratory capacity compared with control tumor cells. Mechanistically, miR-205 overexpression results in decreased expression of the zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) mRNA and protein. This coincides with increased expression of E-cadherin mRNA and protein. Furthermore, re-introduction of ZEB2 into melanoma cells overexpressing miR-205 rescues these phenotypic effects and results in a restoration of cell migration and F-actin polymerization with a concomitant reduction in E-cadherin expression. Together, these results provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for miR-205 as a critical suppressor of melanoma cell migration.","title":"Loss of microRNA-205 expression is associated with melanoma progression.","pubmedId":"22525428"}
