There are two major forms of lung cancer, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) which accounts for approximately 20% of all lung cancers and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancers. Around 25% of these lung cancer patients are never smokers and these cancers tend to be the result of single somatic mutation events. Several somatic events have been reported in NSCLC, including mutations in EGFR and KRAS along with an EML4-ALK fusion gene, however more than 40% of these cancers are the result of unknown genetic events. Recently several papers have reported a novel fusion gene resulting from a 10.6 Mb inversion on chromosome 10 which leads to a fusion between the KIF5B and RET genes. The RET gene is a well-known tyrosine-kinase proto-oncogene which has been linked to papillary thyroid carcinomas and its expression is generally very low in lung. RET tyrosine kinase stimulates autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase unit which activates several pathways including STAT3, RAS/ERK, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and SRC. In the KIF5B-RET fusion KIF5B retains its coiled-coil domain necessary for homodimerization and the RET retains its kinase function leading to aberrant activation of several kinase pathways. Several fusion genes between the exons of KIF5B and RET have been previously reported including KIF5B15:RET12, KIF5B16:RET12, KIF5B22:RET12, KIF5B23:RET12, KIF5B15:RET11, KIF5B24:RET8 and KIF5B24:RET11. In this study we developed a TaqMan qRT-PCR-based approach to evaluate the expression of these seven (7) KIF5B-RET fusion transcripts in 64 NSCLC fresh frozen biopsies, ranging from stage I to stage III, including 25 adenocarcinoma and 37 squamous cell carcinoma samples, respectively. Our findings confirm the presence of the fusion between KIF5B15 (exon 15) and RET12 (exon 12) at a frequency of 1.56% in all subtypes. The clinicopathological background of the KIF5B/RET fusion-positive patient agrees with previously reported trends for this fusion event consisting of a caucasian female, non smoker, with adenocarcinoma subtype. Although this percentage is relatively small, it still represents around 12,000 individuals worldwide that express this fusion transcript, presenting a promising biomarker for targeted therapeutics in the treatment of NSCLC disease.","title":"A real-time qPCR approach to detect fusions between the KIF5B and RET genes in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-3174"}
