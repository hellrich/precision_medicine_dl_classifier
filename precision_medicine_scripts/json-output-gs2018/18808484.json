Inland divisions had on average lower rates than coastal areas. For both men and women, age-standardised incidence rates of invasive and of in situ melanoma increased between 1982 and 2002 for Queensland as a whole and for almost all its statistical divisions. For invasive cancer, the increase was strongest for Moreton (APC men: 5.4%; women: 4.5%; P \u003c 0.001, respectively). APCs were higher for in situ melanoma compared with invasive melanoma for all statistical divisions and both genders. In both genders, the increase in invasive rates was most pronounced for the trunk (APC men: 3.2%, P \u003d 0.040; women: 2.3%; P \u003d 0.306).\nThe south-eastern corner of Queensland endured the main burden of melanoma. Behavioural and lifestyle choices might create the observed differences between statistical divisions. The increase in trunk melanomas is discussed with respect to aetiology.","title":"Geographical variation of incidence of cutaneous melanoma in Queensland.","pubmedId":"18808484"}
