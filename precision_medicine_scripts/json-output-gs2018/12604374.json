These mutations have been recorded in different populations, but to date there is no corresponding study in Mexican families. Our purpose was identification of RET mutations in Mexican families with inherited or sporadic MTC (SMTC) and search for RET protein expression as prognostic marker in MTC tumors.\nNine unrelated families with MTC corresponding either to two MEN 2A, three MEN 2B, or four SMTC were studied. Screening of exons 10, 11, and 13-16 of RET oncogene in DNA from circulating lymphocytes and tumor samples were analyzed. Immuno- staining for RET was performed in the corresponding tumor.\nGermline 918 ATG--\u003eACG RET mutation was present in three unrelated MEN 2B individuals and corresponding somatic mutation in one individual with SMTC; 634 TGC--\u003eTTC RET mutation was detected in two related patients in an MEN 2A family and the 634 TGC--\u003eTAC RET mutation was detected in 12 related individuals from a second MEN 2A family. RET protein expression was detected in all MTC tumors showing different staining intensity.\nRET mutations found in Mexican patients with MTC are similar to those previously reported in several MTC families worldwide. This indicates that RET mutations are highly conserved and that MTC etiology does not depend to a great extent on environmental factors or ethnic differences. Detection of RET protein in MTC tissue sections is not useful as prognostic marker.","title":"RET oncogene mutations in medullary thyroid carcinoma in Mexican families.","pubmedId":"12604374"}
