In animal models, HER-2/neu overexpression was shown to enhance malignancy and metastasis phenotypes. Repression of HER-2/neu overexpression suppresses the malignant phenotypes of HER-2/neu-overexpressing cancer cells, suggesting that HER-2/neu may serve as an excellent target for developing anti-cancer agents. We have previously shown that the adenovirus-5 (Ad5) E1a gene products and the SV40 large T antigen (large T) inhibit transcription of the HER-2/neu promoter and accordingly suppresses transformation induced by HER-2/neu. In this review, we summarize our recent findings on using cationic liposomes or an Ad vector to deliver E1a or large T into tumor-bearing mice. Our results indicate that both cationic liposomes or an Ad vector can efficiently deliver E1a or large T into tumor cells in mice, and this results in suppression of tumor growth and longer survival of the mice.","title":"HER-2/neu-targeting gene therapy--a review.","pubmedId":"7607574"}
