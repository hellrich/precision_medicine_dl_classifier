The recently approved orally active drugs vismodegib (GDC-0449) and sonidegib (LDE-225) were not only efficacious for the treatment of advanced or metastatic BCC by antagonizing the smoothened (SMO) receptor, but also produced important side effects, limiting their use for less invasive BCC. Herein, we compared a large series of SMO antagonists, including GDC-0449 and LDE-225, the clinically tested BMS-833923, CUR-61414, cyclopamine, IPI-926 (saridegib), itraconazole, LEQ-506, LY-2940680 (taladegib), PF-04449913 (glasdegib), and TAK-441 as well as preclinical candidates (PF-5274857, MRT-83) in two SMO-dependent cellular assays and for G-protein activation. We report marked differences in inhibitor potencies between compounds as well as a notable disparity between the G-protein assay and the cellular tests, suggesting that classification of drugs is assay dependent. Furthermore, we explored topical efficacies of SMO antagonists on depilated mice using Gli1 and Ptch1 mRNA quantification in skin as biomarkers of the HH signaling inhibition. This topical model rapidly discriminated drugs in terms of efficacies and potencies for inhibition of both biomarkers. SMO antagonists showed also a large variation in their blood and skin partition, suggesting that some drugs are more favorable for topical application. Overall, our data suggested that in vitro and in vivo efficacious drugs such as LEQ-506 and TAK-441 may be of interest for topical treatment of less invasive BCC with minimal side effects.
