Standard melanoma markers included S100, HMB45, HMB50, tyrosinase, and Melan A. Schwann cell markers included the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the L1 adhesion protein. The degree of immunocytochemical labeling was scored by levels of both intensity and pervasiveness. The results confirmed a distinct difference in labeling between epithelioid and spindled melanomas. The p75NTR was strongly expressed in spindled melanomas and weakly expressed in the epithelioid melanomas. The usual melanoma markers, including HMB45, HMB50, MelanA, and tyrosinase had the reverse pattern, being strongly expressed in virtually all epithelioid melanomas, but rarely expressed in the spindled variants. S100 was unique among the markers in being expressed by both epithelioid and spindled melanomas. Glial fibrillary acidic protein and L1 adhesion protein were expressed moderately, with preferential labeling of the spindled melanomas. The greatest immunophenotypic difference between spindled and epithelioid melanomas was the high abundance of p75NTR expression in spindled melanomas. The functional significance of the high level of p75 neurotrophin receptor expression may contribute to the high predisposition of perineural extension in the desmoplastic subset of spindled melanomas.","title":"The p75 neurotrophin receptor, relative to other Schwann cell and melanoma markers, is abundantly Expressed in spindled melanomas.","pubmedId":"11481518"}
