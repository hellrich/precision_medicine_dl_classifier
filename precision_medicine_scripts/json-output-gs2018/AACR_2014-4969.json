We hypothesized that disruption of A-to-I editing of microRNAs alters expression of genes regulating melanoma progression. By sequencing miRs in primary vs. metastatic melanoma cells, we show that the overall microRNA editing frequencies were reduced in metastatic melanoma cells. Specifically, we found A-to-I editing in two sites of miR-455 in non-metastatic melanoma cells with accumulation of unedited miR-455 in metastatic melanoma cells. Using two animal models, we demonstrated that the unedited miR-455 promoted melanoma growth and metastasis, while the edited form suppressed these features. Unedited miR-455 promotes melanoma progression via suppression of the tumor suppressor cytoplasmic polyadenilation element binding protein (CPEB1). Thus, miR-455 A-to-I editing alters the selection of its target genes and directs its function to inhibit melanoma growth and metastasis. Taken together, our results provide a previously undescribed mechanism (microRNA editing) contributing to melanoma progression.","title":"Hypo adenosine-to-inosine editing of microRNA-455 promotes melanoma metastasis","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4969"}
