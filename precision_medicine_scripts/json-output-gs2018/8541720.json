Activation of c-Kit induces cell proliferation, differentiation or migration among different cell types. The present study provides evidence that c-Kit plays an important role in the cell differentiation rather than in cell proliferation in pigment cells. We found that normal human melanocytes and a limited number of melanoma cells, e.g. WM35, WM39 and G361 cell lines, expressed the c-Kit gene together with tyrosinase and TRP-1 genes. When exposed to alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, these three cell lines also showed an increased tyrosinase (dopa-oxidase) activity. By incubating these cells with 20 ng/ml of stem cell factor (SCF) which is a ligand of c-Kit receptor, we found a transient increase of tyrosinase activity 2-4 h post-incubation, indicating an early response of tyrosinase activation, either by elevating tyrosinase protein expression or by tyrosinase protein modification (e.g. phosphorylation). However, Western blot analysis using anti-tyrosinase antibody suggested that there was no change of tyrosinase protein expression between SCF-treated and non-treated cells. We therefore suggest that protein modulation of tyrosinase (e.g. phosphorylation) plays an important role in c-Kit-induced melanogenesis.","title":"Coordinated mRNA expression of c-Kit with tyrosinase and TRP-1 in melanin pigmentation of normal and malignant human melanocytes and transient activation of tyrosinase by Kit/SCF-R.","pubmedId":"8541720"}
