We aimed to study the antitumor effect of Realgar in combination with chemotherapy drugs on human gastric cancer cells. Methods: Human gastric cancer AGS cells were treated with Realgar in combination with Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan, Cisplatin, 5-FU and docetaxol with escalating dose level. Antitumor effect was measured by 24,48-hr growth inhibition by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and cell morphology was observed under microscope. Results: Realgar in combination with chemotherapy drugs exhibited a dose-dependent and time-dependent cytotoxic effect on AGS cells. The combination of Realgar and Irinotecan or Cisplatin showed the most potent synergistic effect. Conclusions: Realgar combined with chemotherapy drugs such as Irinotecan or Cisplatin has potent antitumor effect on human gastric cancer cells. Further mechanistic and animal studies are being performed.","title":"Antitumor effect of Realgar in combination with chemotherapy drugs on human gastric cancer cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-5525"}
