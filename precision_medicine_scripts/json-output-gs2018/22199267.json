Our studies demonstrated that CD62L, CD27 and CD28 positive effector memory T-cells were present in the TIL samples from the tumor tissues of melanoma patients and T-cell expansion led to the significant loss of memory T-cells. CD27- and CD28-positive T-cells had high levels of CD44 expression. T-Cell expansion resulted in significant down-regulation of CD44 expression. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and anti-CD3 antibody stimulation may be responsible for CD44 down-regulation on CD8(+) T-cells during expansion. Furthermore, CD44 down-regulation using small interfering RNA (siRNA) on TILs dramatically reduced interferon-gamma and IL-2 release upon tumor stimulation. These results suggest that the regulation of CD44 expression in TILs may play an important role in memory T-cell maintenance and antitumor immune response.","title":"Characterization of T-cell memory phenotype after in vitro expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"22199267"}
