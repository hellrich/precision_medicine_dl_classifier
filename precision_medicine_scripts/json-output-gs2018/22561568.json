However, no mutation was found in tissues from benign thyroid tumors. There were significant correlations between BRAF mutation and lymph node metastasis, and between BRAF mutation and the clinical stage of papillary thyroid cancer (P\u003c0.05).\nThe mutation of BRAF is associated with the pathogenesis, lymph node metastasis, and clinical stage of papillary thyroid cancer.","title":"[BRAF mutation and papillary thyroid cancer].","pubmedId":"22561568"}
