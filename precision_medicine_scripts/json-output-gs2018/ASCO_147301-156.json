Resistance to cetuximab and cisplatin, the two most effective systemic agents in HNSCC, is in part attributable to cyclin D1 overexpression which can be targeted with inhibitors of the cyclin D axis. Palbociclib is a selective inhibitor of CDK4/6.  Methods:  A phase I trial was performed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of palbociclib added to cetuximab. Palbociclib was given orally q.d. on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle and cetuximab was given weekly (400 mg/m2, then 250 mg/m2). Palbociclib was given at 100 mg/d (level 1) or 125 mg/d (level 2: max dose). Fibonacci (3+3) design was utilized. Eligible patients (pts) had incurable HNSCC (p16 -or +) and adequate organ function. Correlative studies included total and p- Rb (IHC), p16 (IHC), and PK analysis of palbociclib. Tumor response assessment using RECIST criteria 1.1 was performed every 2 cycles.  Results:  Nine pts were enrolled (5 platin and cetuximab-resistant and 1 cetuximab-resistant ; 5 p16- and 4 p16+): 3 pts on dose level 1 and 6 pts on dose level 2. Mild (grade 1/2) neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 2 pts on dose level 1 and in 4 and 3 pts, respectively, on dose level 2. The MTD was not reached as there were no dose limiting toxicities and no AE-related treatment discontinuations. Tumor response assessment following cycle 2 showed partial response in 2 pts (both at dose level 2; both p16  HNSCC; one with cetuximab- and platin-resistant disease), stable disease in 5 pts (one with cetuximab-resistant disease with an 18% decrease in target lesions), progression in 1 pt, and not yet evaluable in 1 pt. Median time-to-progression was 112 (range: 28-182) days.   Conclusions:  The MTD of palbociclib was not reached during the phase I study; 125 mg/d given on days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle when added to cetuximab, was determined as the recommended phase II dose. Impressively, tumor responses occurred in pts with cetuximab- and platin-resistant HNSCC. Phase II of the trial is enrolling pts with p16-/Rb+ HNSCC on Arm 1 (platin-resistant  disease) and Arm 2 (cetuximab-resistant  disease).
