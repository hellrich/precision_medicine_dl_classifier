Here, we show that CD163-expressing macrophages express a distinct gene expression signature capable of facilitating tumor development and progression. This supports our earlier findings showing significant correlation between CD163+ macrophage density, tumor grade, and poor prognosis in patients with melanoma. Selective eradication of CD163-expressing tumor-associated macrophages through receptor-mediated delivery of nanoparticles encapsulating the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin significantly inhibited tumor formation and prolonged survival in an immune-competent conditional mouse model of BrafV600E-induced, Pten-deficient metastatic melanoma. High-resolution dynamic intravital imaging showed specific targeting of a subpopulation of tumor-infiltrating macrophages expressing the scavenger receptor CD163, including Tie2-expressing macrophages recently identified as being highly proangiogenic.In conclusion, our findings identify CD163-expressing macrophages as a distinct malignancy-promoting phenotype and indicate a novel therapeutic target in cancer.","title":"CD163-expressing macrophages constitute a distinct malignancy-promoting phenotype in melanoma facilitating tumor development, progression, and metastasis: Implications for novel anticancer therapy.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-1534"}
