NSCLC with coexisting driver mutations or amplifications is a cause of great concern. Methods: From 2013 until now, fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to screen for MET amplified NSCLC patients.The amplification of the MET was defined as centromere 7 ratio  2.0 and the criterion of Cappuzzi. The amplification of the PIK3CA was copy numbers  4.0. We established the patient-derived exnograft (PDX) mouse model from a dual MET/PIK3CA-amplified patient. Preclinical efficacy of single versus dual inhibition was evaluated in vivo. Six groups were allocated to receive the treatment of vehicle control, bozitinib,crizotinib, taselisib (PI3K inhibitor), bozitinib+taselisib, or crizotinib+taselisib, respectively. Results: Totally, 568 (568/2321, 24.47%) patients harbored positive MET amplification and 6 (6/568,1%) were comfirmed with dual MET/PI3K amplification. The two stage patients received MET inhibitor treatment.One trial (NCT02896231) patient was treated with bozitinib and achieved confirmed PR, but with 3 months PFS and 5 months OS. The best response was PR and PFS was 5.6 months for the other one receiving the study drug capmatinib (NCT02276027). In the PDX mouse model experiment, we found three single-anget inhibitors monotherapy to be active but only transiently effective in controlling the growth of PDX. The PDX models showed more sensitivity to taselisib among the three single-anget groups. In contrast, the combination of the two inhibitors caused a stronger and long-lasting growth inhibition in PDX models. The addition of taselisib to bozitinib or crizotinib monotherapy provided obvious enhanced activity. Regretfully, two mice died because of the toxicities in the crizotinib+taselisib group. Conclusions: Patients with dual MET/PIK3CA amplification represent a rare molecular subtype of NSCLC and have a relatively short duration of response to MET inhibitors.The combination of MET/PI3K inhibitors is synergistic preclinically.","title":"Co-amplification of MET and PIK3CA in NSCLC and data on a PDX mouse model.","pubmedId":"ASCO_188529-199"}
