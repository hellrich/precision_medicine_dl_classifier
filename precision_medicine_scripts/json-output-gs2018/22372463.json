Here we show that the knockdown of MECOM (E) and MECOM (ME) isoforms reduces cell division at low cell density, inhibits colony-forming cells by 34% and moderately reduces BCR-ABL1 mRNA and protein expression but not tyrosine kinase catalytic activity in K562 cells. We also show that both E and ME are expressed in CD34(+)  selected cells of both CML chronic phase (CML-CP), and non-CML (normal) origin. Furthermore, MECOM mRNA and protein expression were repressed by imatinib mesylate treatment of CML-CP CD34(+)  cells, K562 and KY01 cell lines whereas imatinib had no effect in non-CML BCR-ABL1 -ve CD34(+)  cells. Together these results suggest that BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase catalytic activity regulates MECOM gene expression in CML-CP progenitor cells and that the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein partially mediates its biological activity through MECOM. MECOM gene expression in CML-CP progenitor cells would provide an in vivo selective advantage, contributing to CML pathogenesis.","title":"BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase sustained MECOM expression in chronic myeloid leukaemia.","pubmedId":"22372463"}
