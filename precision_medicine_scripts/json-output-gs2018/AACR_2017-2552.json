During the malignant transformation of breast and bone tissues, normal and malignant cells become fused to form hybrid structures. These enhanced phenotypes acquire genetic characteristics which support initiation, progression, and oncogenesis. In breast cancer and osteosarcoma cell lines, cell fusion generates chromosomal instability, aneuploidy, and DNA damage while maintaining the characteristics of enhanced migration, invasion, and chemoresistance. We have found that mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2) significantly induces cell fusion and the generation of large multinucleated cells in MDA468, MDA231, MDA157, T47D breast cancer and MG63 osteosarcoma cell lines under normoxia when compared to silenced Mdm2 controls (P\u003c0.0005). Interestingly, silencing mutant p53 in the MDA468 cell line resulted in significantly higher fusion events (P\u003c0.0004) suggesting mutant p53 may play a regulatory role in reducing Mdm2-associated cell fusion. Silenced Mdm2 MDA231 cells showed a three-fold increase under hypoxia whereas MG63 cells showed similar levels of cell fusion events as in normoxic conditions suggesting cell specific dependency to environmental stimulus. The variation in proportions of cell fusion among each cell type suggests this phenomenon is dependent on Mdm2 expression and cell type. CD133+ MDA468 cells have increased fractions of polyploidal cell events suggesting stemness may influence the polyploidal giant cancer cell (PGCC) dynamics. The mechanism by which cell fusion occurs in breast and osteosarcoma is poorly understood. Collectively these data suggest the interplay of Mdm2, p53, and stemness in supporting the formation of fused polypoidal cells and may serve as relevant targets for cancer therapy.","title":"MDM2 induces cell fusion in breast cancer and osteosarcoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-2552"}
