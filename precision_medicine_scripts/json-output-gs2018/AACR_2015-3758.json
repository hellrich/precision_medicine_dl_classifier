{"publicationTypes":["2015 AACR Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Neuroblastoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer that displays tremendous clinical and biological heterogeneity. Approximately 40% of patients present with metastatic disease and have poor outcome; new biomarkers that improve risk classification and prognostication are desperately needed. Applying a machine learning-based approach to analyzing transcriptome-wide signals in multiple populations of neuroblastoma patients spanning clinical stage we identified a combined set of 14 clinical and molecular variables that predicted survival outcome and tumor stage with over 87% accuracy. A systems biology-based analysis of the molecular variables from our predictive set identified 5 major networks with hubs defining 3 major ontological processes: apoptosis, nucleotide biosynthesis, and RNA metabolism.","title":"A combined machine learning and bioinformatic analysis approach identifies biological pathways that predict clinical stage and survival outcome in neuroblastoma patients","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-3758"}
