It is characterized by a glioblastoma associated with rhabdoid components.\nHere we report two cases of rhabdoid glioblastoma and a brief literature review. The first patient was a 19-year-old boy who initially presented with a foul-smelling odor and progressive right-side weakness. The second case was a 29-year-old male patient who presented only with a severe headache.\nBoth of these patients were young, and the disease progression was quick despite optimal treatment.\nThe diagnosis of rhabdoid glioblastoma was confirmed after microscopic and immunohistochemical findings.","title":"Rhabdoid glioblastoma: a recently recognized subtype of glioblastoma.","pubmedId":"23812963"}
