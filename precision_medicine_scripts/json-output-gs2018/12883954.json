In most cases adenoid cystic carcinoma has been the predominant component in these lesions. In this study we describe two patients with hybrid tumours located in the palate, one in a 49-year-old woman and one in a 71-year-old man. The first case involved adenoid cystic carcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and the patient in the second case exhibited adenoid cystic carcinoma and epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma. Both patients were treated with surgery and radiotherapy, and there has been no evidence of recurrence after 13 and 36 months of follow-up, respectively. The recognition of the histologic component with the higher grade of malignancy in every case of hybrid tumour of the salivary glands is a necessary step to determine the biological behaviour and, consequently, to determine the proper therapeutic approach.","title":"Hybrid tumours of the salivary glands.
