In a previous report, we showed that recurrent PTC with no radioiodine ((131)I) uptake are frequently associated with BRAF mutations, a low expression of thyroid-related genes and a high expression of glucose type-1 transporter gene.\nThe aim of the present study was to assess BRAF status in a large series of recurrent PTC patients, considering paired primary and recurrent cancers. The BRAF genotype was correlated with the ability to concentrate (131)I and/or 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxi-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG) in the recurrent cancers, serum markers of recurrence, and patient outcome.\nWe studied 50 PTC patients with recurrent cervical disease submitted to a re-intervention, followed up in median for 9 years. BRAF analysis was conducted by direct sequencing and mutant allele-specific PCR amplification. In 18 cases, molecular analysis was also assessed in the primary cancer. Out of 50 patients, 30 underwent (18)F-FDG-positron emission tomography-computed tomography.\nBRAF V600E-positive recurrent patients were found (131)I-negative in 94% of cases (P\u003c0.001); 73% of the cancers carrying BRAF V600E were both (131)I-negative and (18)F-FDG positive. In paired primary and recurrent PTC, BRAF V600E was observed in 79% of the primary cancers and 84% of their recurrences. Three patients with (131)I-negative and BRAF V600E-positive recurrent cancers deceased during follow-up.\nBRAF mutations are more common in thyroid recurrences with no (131)I uptake than in (131)I-positive cases. They are correlated with the ability to concentrate (18)F-FDG, and they can appear, albeit rarely, as a de novo event in the course of PTC recurrences.","title":"BRAF in primary and recurrent papillary thyroid cancers: the relationship with (131)I and 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake ability.","pubmedId":"20647301"}
