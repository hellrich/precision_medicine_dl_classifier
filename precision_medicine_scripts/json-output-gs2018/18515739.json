The majority of medullary thyroid cancers are sporadic, but 20% of cases are a result of a germline mutation in the ret proto-oncogene. Hereditary medullary thyroid cancer can be seen as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2A or 2B or as part of familial medullary thyroid cancer. This article discusses the current methods available for the diagnosis and evaluation of a patient with suspected medullary thyroid cancer. The management of medullary thyroid cancer is predominantly surgical excision, consisting of a total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection. The extent and timing of surgical excision are discussed. Systemic therapeutic options are limited for medullary thyroid cancer, but several therapeutic targets show promise for the development of new therapies in the future.","title":"Current management of medullary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"18515739"}
