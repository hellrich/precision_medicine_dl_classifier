All showed destructive lesions in their hip or intertarsal joints and were between 18 and 62 weeks old when killed. Although surface regressive changes in articular cartilage were common, deep fibrillation, as seen in human and mammalian osteoarthrosis, was not identified. This difference probably reflects the more fibrous nature of articular cartilage in birds, but a number of similarities to hyaline cartilage degeneration were noted. Destructive cartilage loss resulted from partial or full thickness detachment of uncalcified cartilage. Clefts in deep cartilage preceded segmental detachment and occurred in cartilage with an intact articular surface. Detachment of segments of uncalcified cartilage may be the principal method of destructive cartilage loss in all avian species. It is concluded that clefts and destructive cartilage loss in adult broiler fowls can be a consequence of articular osteochondrosis or may result from osteoarthrosic lesions.","title":"Destructive cartilage loss in the joints of adult male broiler breeding fowls.","pubmedId":"3611428"}
