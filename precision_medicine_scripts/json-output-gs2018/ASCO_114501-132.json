There are 3 approved and multiple targeted therapies in clinical trials that rely on the results of these tests. ERBB2 amplification and activation by mutation/fusion has also been described in a wide variety of other ST. As these alterations are not routinely tested for but may predict response to anti-ERBB2 agents we sought to determine their frequency in an unselected cohort of specimens from advanced ST patients.    Methods:  We reviewed genomic profiles from the first 2,223 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens received and analyzed by our CLIA-certified lab (Foundation Medicine) with our NGS platform. 3,230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes and 14 genes frequently rearranged were assayed for base pair substitutions, small insertions/deletions (indels), amplifications, and rearrangements.   Results:  110/2,223 (4.9%) specimens had 116 ERBB2 alterations: 67 (58%) amplifications, 29 (25%) substitutions, 16 (14%) indels, 2 (2%) splice site variants and 2 (2%) translocations, including a potential fusion. Six samples (5%) had multiple alterations, and two had both ERBB2 substitution and amplification.  14 ST types had evidence of ERBB2 alterations including 29% of esophageal, 20% of uterine, 14% of breast, and 12% of stomach carcinomas. 6% of all lung cancer samples had ERBB2 alterations. Amplifications predominated, but lung specimens had predominantly indels. Durable responses exist to anti-ERBB2 agents in STs with activating ERBB2 mutations.  Conclusions:  Use of a broad NGS panel identifies an unprecedented number of actionable genomic changes including a significant rate of ERBB2 alterations across 14 different solid tumor types. The discovery of unanticipated ERBB2 amplifications and activating mutations in a wide variety of ST highlights the need to study a broad range of genes at a high level of sensitivity and specificity when searching for novel targets of therapy. Widespread use of this approach could provide more treatment options and enable more rapid accrual to ongoing and planned trials of agents targeting pathways under study.","title":"An analysis of ERBB2 alterations (amplifications and mutations) found by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 2000+ consecutive solid tumor (ST) patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_114501-132"}
