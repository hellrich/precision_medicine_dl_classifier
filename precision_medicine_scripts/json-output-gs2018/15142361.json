Using age-cohort analysis we analyzed the TC incidence under the impact of two regional risk factors: the contamination of Austrian soils by the radioactive fallout in from Chernobyl 1986 and the increased iodination of table salt in a general program of goiter prophylaxis begun in 1991. To evaluate the characteristics of TC incidence, we compared the results of the periods 1984-1989, 1990-1995, and 1996-2001.\nA total of 734 TC cases were diagnosed. Papillary, follicular, medullary, oxyphilic, and anaplastic TC accounted for 76%, 18%, 3%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The female to male ratio was 3:1. The annual incidence rate increased by 8.05% in females and 11.6% in males. TC cases younger than 40 years of age accounted for 22.6%, with a rate increase of 18% per year in young males, the female-to-male ratio decreased from 8.3, 6.1, 2.7 younger than 40 in the compared periods. Along with a further increase in papillary TC incidence and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) ratio in the adult population, the ratio tended to decrease in the younger than 40-year-old population. T4 class TC and loco-regional lymph node involvement increased significantly.\nThe observed changes in TC incidence, particularly in the young population, as in adults, could be linked to the abovementioned risk factors involved in the initiation and early growth of TC, and iodine may play a role in stimulating overall thyroid activity.","title":"Descriptive epidemiology of thyroid carcinoma in Carinthia, Austria: 1984-2001.
