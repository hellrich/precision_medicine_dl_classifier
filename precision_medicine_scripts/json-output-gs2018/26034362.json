The expression of NOX2, VEGF, EGFR and CD68 in tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of NOX2 in gastric cancer and adjacent tissues was detected by Western blot analysis. Spearman(\u0027)s correlation was performed to elucidate the relationship of NOX2 with VEGF and EGFR. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival time, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate differences in survival. Cox\u0027s proportional hazards regression model was applied in a stepwise manner to analyze the independent prognostic factors.\nNOX2 exhibited positive expression in 47.2% (58/123) of the gastric cancer tissues. Western blot analysis revealed that NOX2 was up-regulated in tumor tissues compared to the adjacent tissue [39.0% (48/123)]. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that CD68, which is a specific marker of macrophages, and NOX expression presented a similar localization and staining intensity. The expression of NOX2 was positively correlated with that of VEGF and EGFR. Comparison of the 5-year survival rates of the NOX2 positive and NOX2 negative groups showed that the NOX2 positive group presented a poor prognosis.\nNOX2 positively correlates with the levels of VEGF and EGFR. NOX2 may be used as a new biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer.","title":"Relationship between expression of NADPH oxidase 2 and invasion and prognosis of human gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"26034362"}
