Glu-Dox conjugates were also functionalized with polyethylenimine (PEI) intended for increasing specific cellular uptake of prepared nanoparticles. The self-assembled nanoparticles were prepared through conjugation of Dox- [Glu-Dox-] using succinic anhydride (Sa) in place of a linker. Nanoparticles had spherical morphology with positive zeta potential. In-vitro cell viability assay on two breast cancer cell lines demonstrated acceptable toxicity against tested cell lines. Confocal microscopic images demonstrated the remarkable cytoplasmic uptake of the nanoparticles in Her2-overexpressing 4T1 cells. A controlled release of Dox from Glu-Dox nanoparticles was investigated. In-vivo studies were performed on female Balb/C mice. The volume of the induced tumors was calculated following intravenous administration of nanoparticles. The tumor volume diminished efficiently and more rapidly after administration of nanoparticles containing Dox. Based on survival results, the formulation of Dox targeted nanoparticles appeared very promising for the treatment of tumors. It could be concluded that Glu-Dox targeted nanoparticles have potential advantages for delivering anticancer drugs to the target tissue.
