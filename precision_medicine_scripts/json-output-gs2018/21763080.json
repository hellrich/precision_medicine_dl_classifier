While most cases of ALK+ ALCL have the common pattern characterized by anaplastic morphology with hallmark cells, a less common but well-recognized variant with a small cell pattern may pose a diagnostic challenge. We report a case of ALK+ ALCL with small cell morphology and CD8 subset restriction in a 53-year-old male patient who presented primarily with multiple recurrent subcutaneous nodules with histopathologic features simulating a subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL). The case was initially diagnosed as SPTCL but was reconsidered as ALK+ ALCL when the incidental finding of CD30 positivity on a subsequent biopsy prompted an ALK immunostain, which turned out to be positive in the neoplastic T-cells. The diagnosis of ALK+ ALCL, small cell variant, was then confirmed by detection of an ALK gene rearrangement by FISH analysis. This report highlights a case of ALK+ ALCL with a deceiving clinical and histopathologic presentation, and emphasizes the value of immunohistochemical panel studies and genetic tests in such cases to avoid diagnostic errors.","title":"A small cell variant of ALK-positive, CD8-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma with primary subcutaneous presentation mimicking subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"21763080"}
