There were 34 males and 14 females, and their ages ranged from 21 to 79 years (mean, 58). The site of origin of the tumor was the nasal cavity in 26 cases, the oral cavity in 15, larynx in two, lip mucosa in two, pharynx in two and upper esophagus in one. At presentation, the neoplasm was limited to the primary site in 60.4% of the patients. Most patients (34) were treated with surgery alone. Nine were treated with surgery combined with chemo- and/or radiotherapy and five with radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Only when surgery was part of the treatment (42 of 48 cases) the patients were rendered disease free, but no further relapse of disease was documented in only five of these patients. The observed 2- and 5-year survival rate of the entire group was 45% and 21%, respectively. The 4-year disease-free survival rate was 7%. The median interval between therapy and the first relapse was 8.5 months (range, 1-66). In 44% of the patients the first recurrence of the tumor was at the primary site.","title":"Mucosal malignant melanoma of head and neck: forty-eight cases treated at Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan.","pubmedId":"8359279"}
