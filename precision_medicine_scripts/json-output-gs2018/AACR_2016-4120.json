About half of patients with uveal melanoma will develop metastatic disease to the liver and the lung. These tumors are characterized by mutations in G-proteins (GNAQ and GNA11), activation of MAPK, and over-expression of c-Met. We have previously reported that c-Met inhibition inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis formation in uveal melanoma. Altiratinib is a selective inhibitor for c-Met as well as TIE2, VEGFR2 and TRK kinases. We found that this agent had no effect on inhibiting cell growth, consistent with our previous findings with crizotinib. However, it did inhibit invasion of uveal melanoma cells through matrigel in a concentration dependent fashion (25 nM to 250 nM) with inhibition of phospho-Met noted at concentrations as low as 25 nM. Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, is currently in clinical trial in patients with this disease. We found that treatment with 250 nM selumetinib inhibited cell proliferation but unexpectedly induced a marked increase in cell invasion of GNAQ and GNA11 mutant cell lines. This was associated with an increase in c-Met RNA and protein expression, as well as receptor phosphorylation, after 24 hours of selumetinib treatment. Combining selumetinib with altiratinib inhibited cell invasion to the level of altiratinib alone and continued to inhibit cell proliferation to the level of selumetinib alone. This effect was recapitulated by the knockdown of c-Met by siRNA prior to treatment with selumetinib. In a uveal melanoma xenograft model, the combination treatment of 15 mg/kg altiratinib and 25 mg/kg selumetinib significantly delayed tumor growth compared to vehicle control, altiratinib and selumetinib alone. Western blot analysis of tumor tissue confirmed target inhibition of p-Met and p-ERK in animals treated with altiratinib and selumetinib, respectively. Furthermore, tumor metastasis was inhibited by altiratinib, selumetinib and combination treatments in a uveal melanoma mouse model. These results indicate that the combined inhibition of MEK and c-Met by selumetinib and altiratinib, respectively, may be sufficient to suppress uveal melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. This strategy can potentially be used as therapy for patients with primary uveal melanoma who are at high risk for the development of metastatic disease.","title":"c-Met inhibition blocks MEK-induced tumor cell invasion in uveal melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4120"}
