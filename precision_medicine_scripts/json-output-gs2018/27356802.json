Subjects were divided into six groups by 10 aged segment.Differences between groups and age tendency were observed.\nThe mean values of cSBP, AI, AP, haPWV and baPWV were (113±12) mmHg, (90±18)%, (-5±9) mmHg, (987±144) cm/s and (1 382±254) cm/s, respectively.cSBP, AI, AP, haPWV and baPWV increased with age (P\u003c0.001). In average, cSBP, baPWV and haPWV increased 3 mmHg, 97 cm/s and 62 cm/s by additional 10 years, respectively.cSBP, AI and AP increased slowly after 60 years old, while haPWV and baPWV increased significantly with age (P\u003c0.001). Stepwise regression analysis showed: cSBP was mainly relevant with mean arterial pressure(b\u003d0.990, P\u003c0.001), while baPWV and haPWV were relevant with age(b\u003d8.858, 5.971; P\u003c0.001). AI and AP were associated with height and rest heart rate (b\u003d-0.676, -0.660 and b\u003d-0.361, -0.341, P\u003c0.001). Individuals were divided into two groups by age 60.The age-related changes in AI were significant in under 60-year-old; while the changes in baPWV were more prominent in over 60-year-old.However there was no significant difference in cSBP between two groups.\nIn healthy people, there are obvious differences of age tendency in central hemodynamics and peripheral arterial stiffness parameters.AI might be a good predictor of cardiovascular disease for early stage, especially for early coronary artery disease.","title":"[Cross-sectional study of differential effects with age on non-invasive central hemodynamics and peripheral arterial stiffness of healthy people in Beijing communities].","pubmedId":"27356802"}
