When she was 51 years old, she developed dermatomyositis for the first time 6 months after the resection of breast cancer, whose histological type was tubular adenocarcinoma. The dermatomyositis remitted without oral corticosteroids in 2 months, and the remission had continued for 6 years. However, at the age of 56, dermatomyositis abruptly recurred with a pruritic generalized rash, Gottron\u0027s papules and elevated serum CK levels. Examination for malignancy revealed an ovarian tumor, which was diagnosed as serous papillaly adenocarcinoma, and the surgery was performed. After the resection of the ovarian cancer, skin rash was improved dramatically and CK levels were normalized again without oral corticosteroids. Since there were no evidences of recurrence of the breast cancer, it was considered that each episode of dermatomyositis was associated with each of the cancers, respectively. We report this rare and interesting case to consider the etiology of cancer-associated myositis as a paraneoplastic syndrome, since the two cancers have different histological types.","title":"[A case of dermatomyositis associated with different types of cancers at intervals of six years].","pubmedId":"15678898"}
