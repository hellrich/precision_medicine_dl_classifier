However, before a biomarker can be reliably employed to assess treatment response, the reproducibility of the technique must be established. There is a paucity of literature that quantifies the reproducibility of DW-MRI in preclinical studies; thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate DW-MRI reproducibility in a murine model of HER2+ breast cancer.\nTest-Retest DW-MRI scans separated by approximately six hours were acquired from eleven athymic female mice with HER2+ xenografts using a pulsed gradient spin echo diffusion-weighted sequence with three b values [150, 500, and 800s/mm(2)]. Reproducibility was assessed for the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from tumor and muscle tissue regions.\nThe threshold to reflect a change in tumor physiology in a cohort of mice is defined by the 95% confidence interval (CI), which was±0.0972×10(-3)mm(2)/s (±11.8%) for mean tumor ADC. The repeatability coefficient defines this threshold for an individual mouse, which was±0.273×10(-3)mm(2)/s. The 95% CI and repeatability coefficient for mean ADC of muscle tissue were±0.0949×10(-3)mm(2)/s (±8.30%) and±0.266×10(-3)mm(2)/s, respectively.\nMean ADC of tumors is reproducible and appropriate for detecting treatment-induced changes on both an individual and mouse cohort basis.","title":"Assessing reproducibility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging studies in a murine model of HER2+ breast cancer.","pubmedId":"24433723"}
