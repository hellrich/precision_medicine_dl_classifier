Of thirty-five colorectal cancers examined, one rectal cancer showed an unusually high transformation efficiency and, in this rectal cancer, the N-ras oncogene was found to be activated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the activated N-ras showed a single G----C point mutation at the first letter of codon 13, resulting in the coding of arginine instead of glycine. This amino-acid substitution at codon 13 may be responsible for the efficient induction of transformants of NIH3T3 cells in vitro.","title":"Amino-acid substitution at codon 13 of the N-ras oncogene in rectal cancer in a Japanese patient.","pubmedId":"3102434"}
