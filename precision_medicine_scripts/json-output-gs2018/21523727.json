FLT3 mutation did not have an impact on event-free survival (EFS) in patients with CBF-AML (P \u003d .84) and poor-risk AML (P \u003d .37). In patients with NK-AML, EFS was worse in the FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) group (20 weeks vs 41 weeks; P \u003c .00,001) but not in the FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) point mutation group (61 weeks vs 41 weeks; P \u003d .15). Worse EFS and overall survival (OS) were observed among patients with NK-AML and higher FLT3-ITD burden but not among patients with FLT3-TKD mutation. In multivariate analysis, FLT3-ITD mutation was prognostic of EFS in patients with NK-AML (hazard ratio, 3.1; P \u003d .03).\nFLT3 mutations did not have a prognostic impact in patients with AML who had good-risk and poor-risk karyotypes. In patients with NK-AML, FLT3-ITD mutations led to worse survival, which was even worse among patients who had high mutation burden.","title":"Prognostic value of FLT3 mutations among different cytogenetic subgroups in acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"21523727"}
