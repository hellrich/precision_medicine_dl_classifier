Several BRAF(V600E) inhibitors have been developed, although they harbor some liabilities, thus motivating the development of other BRAF(V600E) inhibitor options. We report here the use of an ELISA based high-throughput screen to identify a family of related quinolol/naphthol compounds that preferentially inhibit BRAF(V600E) over BRAF(WT) and other kinases. We also report the X-ray crystal structure of a BRAF/quinolol complex revealing the mode of inhibition, employ structure-based medicinal chemistry efforts to prepare naphthol analogues that inhibit BRAF(V600E) in vitro with IC(50) values in the 80-200 nM range under saturating ATP concentrations, and demonstrate that these compounds inhibit MAPK signaling in melanoma cells. Prospects for improving the potency and selectivity of these inhibitors are discussed.","title":"Identification of a novel family of BRAF(V600E) inhibitors.","pubmedId":"22537109"}
