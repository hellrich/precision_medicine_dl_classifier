Preoperative treatment consisted of 30-45 Gy of gastric irradiation with continuous 5-fluorouracil and weekly cisplatin. Surgical resection was performed 4-6 weeks later. EGFR expression in pretreatment tumor biopsies was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Level of EGFR expression was determined from the intensity and extent of staining. Tumor response was defined as a reduction of at least one T-stage level and/or finding of intense tumor regression in histopathologic examination.\nSeventeen patients responded to preoperative chemoradiation -- 8 patients (22%) had pathologic complete response, 9 patients (25%) were downstaged. Positive EGFR expression was found in 8 tumors (22%), and represented a significant predictive marker of poor tumor response in multivariate logistic regression analysis (p \u003d 0.015). Response to chemoradiotherapy was found in 60% (16/28) of EGFR negative patients and in 13% (1/8) of EGFR positive patients (p \u003d 0.044). None of the eight EGFR positive patients achieved pathologic complete response in comparison with 8/28 (29%) of patients with EGFR negative staining (p \u003d 0.16).\nEGFR may represent a molecular marker predictive for poor response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced gastric carcinoma.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor as a predictor of tumor response to preoperative chemoradiation in locally advanced gastric carcinoma.","pubmedId":"19016018"}
