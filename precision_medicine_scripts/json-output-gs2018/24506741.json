The present study was designed to investigate the prognostic value of plasma D-dimer level in lung cancer.\nPlasma levels of the D-dimer in 138 lung cancer patients [98 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 40 small cell lung cancer (SCLC)] were measured before the initiation of any therapy and each chemotherapy.\nThere were 124 (89.9%) men and 14 (10.1%) women with a mean age of 62.8 years (range 38-84). There were no statistically significant differences among the histopathologic types for NSCLC patients. Stage IIIA NSCLC group had statistically significant higher D-dimer level than stages I-II and IV. D-dimer levels were increased significantly after 4 cycles of chemotherapy in progressive disease. The median survival times in NSCLC patients were 26.6 months (95% CI, 17.6-35.6) and 15.9 months (95% CI, 4.2-27.7; p\u003d 0.037) respectively, for patients with a low D-dimer level (â‰¤ 1.2 ng/L) and a high D-dimer level (\u003e 1.2 ng/L).With the cox-regression analysis, the plasma level of D-dimer and tumour stage were identified as independent predictive factors of the survival.\nThese results suggest that plasmalevel of D-dimer can act as a predictive factor of decreased survival and a poor response to the treatment in lung cancer.","title":"[Could plasma D-dimer levels be a predictive marker for prognosis in lung cancer?].","pubmedId":"24506741"}
