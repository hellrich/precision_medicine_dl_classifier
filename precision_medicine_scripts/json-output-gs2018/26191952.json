However, its role in conferring durable relapse-free intervals remains in question. Herein we sought to investigate FLT3 mutational status on transplant outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 262 consecutive AML patients who underwent first-time allogeneic HCT (2008-2014), of whom 171 had undergone FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutational testing. FLT3-mutated AML was associated with nearly twice the relapse risk (RR) compared with those without FLT3 mutation 3 years post-HCT (63% vs 37%, P\u003c0.001) and with a shorter median time to relapse (100 vs 121 days). FLT3 mutational status remained significantly associated with this outcome after controlling for patient, disease and transplant-related risk factors (P\u003c0.05). Multivariate analysis showed a significant association of FLT3 mutation with increased 3-year RR (hazard ratio (HR) 3.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.13, 6.19, P\u003c0.001) and inferior disease-free survival (HR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.27, P\u003c0.01) and overall survival (HR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.24, P\u003c0.05). These data demonstrate high risk of early relapse after allogeneic HCT for FLT3-mutated AML that translates into adverse disease-free and overall survival outcomes. Additional targeted and coordinated interventions are needed to maintain durable remission after allogeneic HCT in this high-risk population.
