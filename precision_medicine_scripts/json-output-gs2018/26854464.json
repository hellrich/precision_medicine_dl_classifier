Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)constitutes the majority of patients with lung cancer (about 85% of all pathologically defined lung cancer cases). A broad spectrum of genomic imbalances, including chromosome polysomy/aneuploidy or specific gene deregulation mechanisms, such as point mutations, deletions and amplifications has been already identified in the corresponding patients, modifying their response rates to novel targeted therapeutic regimens, and affecting also their life span. Among all chromosomes, chromosome 7 seems to play a critical role in NSCLC development and progression. Aberrations in significant genes located on it, such as EGFR, cMET, BRAF combined with numerical abnormalities of the whole chromosome are cytogenetic events that lead to specific molecular signatures in patients with NSCLC. Detection of these chromosome/gene imbalances based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization provides to oncologists the right genetic substrate for handling these patients in a rational therapeutic way regarding their isolated molecular profile. In the current paper, we present the structural and functional profile of chromosome 7 focused on its alterations in NSCLC.
