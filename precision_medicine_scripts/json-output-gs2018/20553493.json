Variations in the types and frequencies of mutations at different tumour sites suggest that they may provide clues to the identity of the causative mutagenic agent. A useful model for studying human TP53 mutagenesis is the partial human TP53 knock-in (Hupki) mouse containing exons 4-9 of human TP53 in place of the corresponding mouse exons. For an in vitro assay, embryo fibroblasts from the Hupki mouse can be examined for the generation and selection of TP53 mutations because mouse cells can be immortalized by mutation of Tp53 alone. Thus far, four environmental carcinogens have been examined using the Hupki embryo fibroblast immortalization assay: (a) UV light, which is linked to human skin cancer; (b) benzo[a]pyrene, which is associated with tobacco smoke-induced lung cancer; (c) 3-nitrobenzanthrone, a suspected human lung carcinogen linked to diesel exposure; and (d) aristolochic acid, which is linked to Balkan endemic nephropathy-associated urothelial cancer. In each case, a unique TP53 mutation pattern was generated that corresponded to the pattern found in human tumours where exposure to these agents has been documented. Therefore, the Hupki embryo fibroblast immortalization assay has sufficient specificity to make it applicable to other environmental mutagens that putatively play a role in cancer aetiology. Despite the utility of the current Hupki embryo fibroblast immortalization assay, it has several limitations that could be addressed by future developments, in order to improve its sensitivity and selectivity.","title":"Linking environmental carcinogen exposure to TP53 mutations in human tumours using the human TP53 knock-in (Hupki) mouse model.","pubmedId":"20553493"}
