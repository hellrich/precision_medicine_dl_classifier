Optimal cut point was systematically tested, and the effect of bcl-2 status on survival in the high-risk group was studied.\nAmong N+ patients the index value 1.5 reflected the biggest difference in survival. There was a significant correlation between erbB2 positivity and bcl-2 negativity. ErbB2 was a prognosticator among postmenopausal, N+, and postmenopausal N+ patients. In multivariate analysis, erbB2 was the best prognosticator among postmenopausal N+ patients. Six out of seven N+ patients with erbB2 index 1.5 or above died including all postmenopausal patients. Bcl-2 positivity was associated with longer survival in the erbB2 positive patient group.\nThe most obvious patients for primary trastuzumab therapy in breast cancer are N+ patients with high erbB2 immunostaining index (\u003e 1.5) and bcl-2 negative immunostaining. In our material 2% of all breast cancer patients fell in this category. This patient group should be selected for testing trastuzumab in the primary treatment.","title":"Quantitation of erbB2 positivity for evaluation of high-risk patients.","pubmedId":"12553494"}
