One hundred invasive breast carcinomas were reviewed and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed in all cases. Immunohistochemical scores showed a perfect concordance with fluorescence in situ hybridization amplification ratios (p \u003c 0.0001). The results indicated a significant correlation between HER-2/neu and grade, but an inverse relationship between HER-2/neu and hormone receptors. In women aged â‰¤ 45 years, an inverse relationship between HER-2/neu and progesterone receptor was found and no association was noted between HER-2/neu and other factors. In women aged \u003e 45 years, the results indicated a significant correlation between HER-2/neu and grade, and there was an inverse relationship between HER-2/neu and hormone receptors.","title":"Correlation of HER 2/neu gene amplification with immunohistochemistry and other prognostic factors in breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"21935868"}
