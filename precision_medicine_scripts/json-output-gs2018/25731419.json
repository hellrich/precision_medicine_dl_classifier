The initial local recurrent site was the resection stump in 5 patients the chest wall in 3 patients, mediastinum in 1 patient, and diaphragm in 1 patient), and the hilar and/or mediastinal lymph node (HMLN) in 17 patients. The sites of distant metastasis were the lungs in 10 patients, pleura in 4 patients, brain in 7 patients, liver in 5 patients, bone in 4 patients, and other sites in 4 patients. Treatments after initial recurrence included surgery in 2 patients, radiotherapy in 5 patients, chemotherapy in 9 patients, and chemo-radiotherapy in 5 patients. Only 1 patient received supportive care. The response to radiotherapy was a complete response (R) in 1 patient, partial response (PR) in 5 patients, stable disease (SD )in 3 patients, and progressive disease (PD )in 1 patient. The best response of all lines of chemotherapy was CR in 3 patients, PR in 4 patients, SD in 3 patients, and PD in 4 patients. The median post-recurrence survival (PRS) time with local recurrence was better than that with distant metastasis (23 vs 14 months); however, the best PRS was obtained in patients with recurrence in the lungs (29 months). A CR for more than 2 years was obtained in 1 patient after surgery, in 1 patient after radiotherapy, and in 2 patients after chemotherapy. Although local recurrence of resected NSCLC can be potentially controlled by using local treatments - such as surgery and radiotherapy - or systemic chemotherapy, curative aggressive treatment should be considered when required.","title":"[Post-recurrence survival after surgical resection of non-small cell lung cancer with local recurrence].","pubmedId":"25731419"}
