The response of this disease to chemotherapy is not well described. The aim of this study was to investigate the response rate and progression-free survival in a series of epithelioid sarcoma patients treated with chemotherapy at a single referral center.\nA retrospective search of a prospectively maintained database was made to identify epithelioid sarcoma patients treated with chemotherapy between 1990 and 2009. Radiological response and histological diagnosis were re-reviewed for this study.\nTwenty-one epithelioid sarcoma patients treated with chemotherapy were identified; follow-up data on palliative chemotherapy was available on 20 of these patients. The median age was 36.5 years (range, 17.4 to 64.8 y) and the male/female ratio was 19:2. Ten patients (50%) were treated with single-agent anthracycline, 9 patients (45%) were treated with a combination therapy (anthracycline and ifosfamide), and 1 patient received trabectedin (5%). Three patients achieved a partial response, 12 had stable disease, and 5 progressed. The median progression-free survival was 29 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23-35). Seven and 3 patients received second-line and third-line palliative chemotherapy, respectively. The median overall survival from commencing palliative chemotherapy in our series was 51 weeks (95% confidence interval; 29-73).\nSystemic chemotherapy provides satisfactory palliation in patients with epithelioid sarcoma. However, this is an aggressive disease, responses to chemotherapy are of short duration and there is a need for more effective novel therapies in the treatment of this condition.","title":"Role of palliative chemotherapy in advanced epithelioid sarcoma.","pubmedId":"21422990"}
