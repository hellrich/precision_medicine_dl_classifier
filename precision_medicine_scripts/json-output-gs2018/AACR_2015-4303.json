PD-L1 positivity was defined as staining in 1% of cells. The concordance of PD-L1 expression in paired samples was analyzed by treating the IHC proportion score as a continuous variable or classifying staining as positive or negative.Results: 48 patients were included. Median age was 65 years (range, 23-85), 73% were male, and 60% had stage I-IIIA disease. All first samples and 85% of second samples were surgical samples. The median interval between sample collection dates was 25.3 months (range, 3.1-203.5). There was no statistically significant correlation of the PD-L1 IHC proportional score between paired samples (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.13). 40% of patients had an increased proportion score at the second time point, and 10% had a decreased score. The prevalence of PD-L1 positivity was 31% in first samples and 46% in second samples. The concordance rate was 65% (95% CI, 49%-78%) when PD-L1 expression was categorized as positive or negative (Table). The concordance rate was similar in paired samples collected within and beyond 2 years.Conclusion: Our preliminary analysis did not suggest a significant correlation of PD-L1 expression in paired melanoma samples collected at different time points. Similar results were observed when samples were categorized as PD-L1 positive or PD-L1 negative. The 35% discordance rate between initial and subsequent tumor samples should be considered if PD-L1 expression is used for selection of enrollment in clinical trials.","title":"Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in paired melanoma tumor samples","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4303"}
