Malignant transformation of struma ovarii is rare and poorly understood, although this process is thought to be similar to carcinogenesis in malignant tumors of differentiated thyroid tissue originating in the thyroid gland. Genetic alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, including mutations of BRAF, RAS, and RET genes, have been implicated in the development of differentiated thyroid carcinoma arising in the thyroid gland. We report here a case with RAS mutation detected in a malignant struma ovarii. The patient is a 38-year-old female who had a 2.4 cm ovarian cyst noted incidentally on a first trimester ultrasound. She proceeded to ovarian cystectomy post-delivery, with pathologic examination detecting a papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular variant, arising in a cystic teratoma. The tumor was tested for BRAF, RAS, and RET/PTC mutations. HRAS codon 61 mutation was identified. This is the first report of RAS mutation detected in the follicular variant of papillary carcinoma arising in a struma ovarii. It provides evidence that tumors developing in this setting involve molecular mechanisms similar to those implicated in tumors developing in the thyroid gland.","title":"RAS mutation-positive follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma arising in a struma ovarii.","pubmedId":"19898969"}
