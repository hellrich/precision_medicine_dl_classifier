C-kit expression was detected in 42.1% of triple negative breast cancers. Only 1 activating mutation was detected in exon 11 of C-kit gene in 1 case. No activating mutations were found in the other 44 cases. C-kit expression is a frequent finding in triple negative breast cancers; 1 activating mutation which was also found in gastrointestinal stromal tumors was detected; a few cases might benefit from imatinib.
