It is used as adjuvant therapy or alone at recurrence. The chemosensitivity of PMBT differs among tumors of different histological types. The role of chemotherapy in the treatment strategy will be reviewed by tumor type (malignant astrocytic gliomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas, anaplastic ependymomas, medulloblastomas, germinomas, primary malignant cerebral lymphoma).","title":"[Chemotherapy of primary malignant brain tumors in adults].","pubmedId":"8729351"}
