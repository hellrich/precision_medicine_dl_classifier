Unlike melanoma, BRAF inhibitor monotherapy has limited activity in BRAFm mCRC. Preclinically, BRAF inhibition results in rapid feedback activation of EGFR and ongoing tumor proliferation, which can be readily overcome by combining BRAF and EGFR inhibition. EViCT examined the safety and efficacy of combining two oral agents targeting BRAF with Vemurafenib (Vem) and EGFR with Erlotinib (Erl), in BRAFm mCRC pts. Herein, we report safety and preliminary efficacy data. Methods: EViCT had 2 parts: a Phase I dose escalation of Erl (cohort 1: 100mg qd; cohort 2: 150mg qd) together with Vem 960mg bd, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The Phase II component involved dose expansion at MTD using a Simon 2-stage design to treat 9 pts in stage 1 and 15 pts in stage 2. Cycles were 28 days. Eligible pts had ECOG \u003c 1, \u003c 2 lines of systemic therapy for metastatic disease, and acceptable organ function. Staging CT scans were performed every 2 cycles, response assessed using RECIST 1.1. Primary endoint was clinical benefit rate (CR, PR and SD). A number of pharmacodynamics correlates were assessed including serial ctDNA, FDG-PET and optional tumour biopsies. Pts were treated until disease progression or toxicity requiring discontinuation. Results: Between Jul-2014 and Oct-2016, 30 BRAFm mCRC pts were enrolled. The Phase I Lead-in enrolled 4 pts in cohort 1 and 7 pts in cohort 2. There was 1 DLT (grade 3 hand-foot syndrome) in cohort 2. MTD/Recommended Phase 2 Dose was Erl 150mg qd and Vem 960mg bd, the full dose for each agent. The Phase II expansion enrolled 19 pts. Overall, 23 pts are evaluable for this interim analysis. Median age was 61 years, 11 (48%) pts were male. Most pts had 1(50%) or 2 (41%) lines of prior treatment. Overall response rate was 39% (95%CI \u003d [20%, 61%]), including 5 (22%) confirmed PR, 4 (17%) unconfirmed PR, 3 (13%) stable disease and 11 (48%) progressive disease. Conclusions: Vem and Erl can both be given safely at their individual full doses when used in combination. In BRAFm mCRC, this combination resulted in clear clinical activity.
