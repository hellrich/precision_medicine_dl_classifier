Here, we describe a 6-bp insertion in the activation loop of FLT3 between codons 840 and 841 of FLT3 (FLT3-840GS) in 2 unrelated patients with AML. Screening for other activating mutations of FLT3, KIT, and NRAS showed no further genetic alterations in patients carrying the FLT3-840GS. In functional analyses we could show that this mutant is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine and confers interleukin 3-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells, which can be inhibited by a specific FLT3 protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor. Our results show for the first time that in addition to known mutations in the JM and the catalytic domain, further activating length mutations exist in the FLT3 gene.","title":"A new and recurrent activating length mutation in exon 20 of the FLT3 gene in acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"12384447"}
