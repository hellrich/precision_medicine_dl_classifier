The molecular mechanisms mediating RET rearrangement with other genes and the role of partner genes in tumorigenesis have been described. In addition, the RET protein has become a molecular target for medullary thyroid carcinoma treatment. ","title":"Thyroid Cancer: Role of RET and Beyond.","pubmedId":"24782993"}
