We present an exceptional case of an elderly man with primary cutaneous ALCL and no systemic disease for a 13-year period. Recurrent skin tumors in this patient were characterized by anaplastic, often multinucleated, cells infiltrating the lymphatics and associated with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. Cutaneous lymphocyte antigen was absent and EMA/MUC1, typical of systemic ALCL, was strongly expressed by the tumor cells. Remarkably, the tumor cells expressed a cytoplasmic-only variant of ALK protein, as reported in 3 previous cases of primary cutaneous ALCL. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed lack of rearrangements of the chromosome 2 ALK gene locus usually involved by translocation t(2;5) or other chromosomal rearrangements that generate nucleophosmin-ALK or the variant ALK fusions that occur in systemic ALCL. Nonetheless, the cytoplasmic ALK protein in the patient\u0027s tumor cells was shown to be phosphorylated/activated, suggesting a novel mechanism of ALK activation. Primary cutaneous ALCL of this novel subtype should be distinguished from systemic ALCL to ensure proper clinical management.","title":"Primary cutaneous ALCL with phosphorylated/activated cytoplasmic ALK and novel phenotype: EMA/MUC1+, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen negative.","pubmedId":"18670345"}
