Patients typically have a poor prognosis with very few options for treatment. (2) With current therapy of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, median survival is only 6 months from the time of diagnosis. Several mutations in cell cycle regulation have been discovered in ATC that contribute to its undifferentiated state, one of which is the BRAF kinase mutation. This mutation results in activation of the MAPK pathway and uncontrolled cell proliferation. In this case report, a 51 y old male presented with a 2-week history of hoarseness and was diagnosed with ATC. Genetic analysis revealed a mutation in BRAF kinase; the patient subsequently began therapy with vemurafenib, a BRAF kinase inhibitor indicated for melanoma. After an initial response, the patient quickly declined and consequently died from his disease. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a deadly cancer without an effective treatment. Inhibiting mutated enzymes that drive the development of this cancer is a potential drug target that may improve outcomes in patients with ATC.
