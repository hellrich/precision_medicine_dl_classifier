Urine is an excellent source of potential biomarkers due to the safety of the collection procedure. The purpose of this study was to determine the features specific for the urine proteome of preterm newborns and their changes under respiratory pathologies of infectious and non-infectious origin. The urine proteome of 37 preterm neonates with respiratory diseases and 10 full-term newborns as a control group were investigated using the LC-MS/MS method. The total number of identified proteins and unique peptides was 813 and 3672 respectively. In order to further specify the defined infant-specific dataset these proteins were compared with urine proteome of healthy adults (11 men and 11 pregnant women) resulting in 94 proteins found only in infants. Pairwise analysis performed for label-free proteomic data revealed 36 proteins which reliably distinguished newborns with respiratory disorders of infectious genesis from those with non-infectious pathologies, including: proteins involved in cell adhesion (CDH-2,-5,-11, NCAM1, TRY1, DSG2), metabolism (LAMP1, AGRN, TPP1, GPX3, APOD, CUBN, IDH1), regulation of enzymatic activity (SERPINA4, VASN, GAPDH), inflammatory and stress response (CD55, CD 93, NGAL, HP, TNFR, LCN2, AGT, S100P, SERPINA1/C1/B1/F1).","title":"Investigation of urine proteome of preterm newborns with respiratory pathologies.","pubmedId":"27321582"}
