Patients have an improved survival rate, especially if they also have a methylated promoter of the methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) gene. It is advisable to consider treating young patients with primary glioblastoma multiforme who are in good condition with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. Efficacy of temozolomide in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme is limited.","title":"[Temozolomide in patients with a glioblastoma multiforme: new developments].","pubmedId":"15997689"}
