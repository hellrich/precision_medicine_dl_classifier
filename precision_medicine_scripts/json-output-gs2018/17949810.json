Nuclear overexpression of the Wnt effector beta-catenin and deregulated beta-catenin nuclear signaling can promote malignant transformation in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. However, a role for beta-catenin in mast cell leukemia has not been described. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin is upregulated by its tyrosine phosphorylation, a process that can be exacerbated by deregulated expression of oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Here, we investigated the relationship between activated KIT and beta-catenin signaling in mast cell leukemia. Beta-catenin was tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells with KIT activated by either gain-of-function mutation or incubation with the KIT ligand stem cell factor. Beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation depended on KIT activity but not on PI3K-AKT activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was associated with its nuclear localization and enhanced transcription of target genes c-myc and cyclin D1. Endogenous KIT and beta-catenin were found to associate in mast cell leukemia cells, and in vitro kinase assay demonstrated that active KIT phosphorylates tyrosine residues of beta-catenin directly. Aberrant beta-catenin-driven transcription caused by deregulated KIT may represent a significant new target for treatment of mast cell leukemia.","title":"KIT regulates tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization of beta-catenin in mast cell leukemia.","pubmedId":"17949810"}
