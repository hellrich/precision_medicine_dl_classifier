In this study we wanted to elucidate whether the described cumulative effect of cisplatin and Anti-EGFR therapy also depends on the EGFR expression.\nXenotransplanted carcinomas with different EGFR levels were treated with monoclonal antibodies against the EGFR (EMD 72000 and EMD 55900), cisplatinum and a combination of both.\nEach monoclonal antibody alone led to an EGFR-dependent significant tumor growth reduction. Cisplatinum alone had no growth inhibitory effects on tumors with high content in contrast to those with low EGFR content. The combination of antibodies with cisplatinum resulted in an EGFR-independent tumor growth inhibition which was stronger than observed in the case of monotherapy.\nThe obtained results may address upcoming phase I/II trials to use Anti-EGFR/Cisplatinum therapy regardless of the EGFR content of tumors.","title":"Carcinomas unresponsive to either cisplatinum or anti-EGFR therapy can be growth inhibited by combination therapy of both agents.","pubmedId":"12894544"}
