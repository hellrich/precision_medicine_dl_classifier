Since then, somatic mutations have been observed in many cancers and germline alterations have been found in kindreds with familial atypical multiple mole/melanoma (FAMMM), also known as atypical mole syndrome. In this review we tabulate the known mutations in this gene and discuss specific aspects, particularly with respect to germline mutations and cancer predisposition.","title":"The CDKN2A (p16) gene and human cancer.","pubmedId":"9132280"}
