Number of cases in the family, number of primary melanomas, and age of onset were associated with the presence of CDKN2A mutation. Having a CDKN2A mutation in the family increased the prevalence of other cancers (prevalence ratio [PR] 2.99, P\u003d.012) and prevalence of pancreatic (PR 2.97, P\u003d.006), lung (PR 3.04, P\u003c.001), and breast (PR 2.19, P\u003d.018) cancers but not nephrourologic or colon cancer.\nSmoking status was not assessed in the individuals with lung cancer.\nMelanoma-prone families with mutations in CDKN2A have an increased prevalence of a broad spectrum of cancers including lung, pancreatic, and breast cancer. This information should be included in genetic counseling and cancer prevention programs for CDKN2A mutation carriers.","title":"Increased prevalence of lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers in addition to melanoma risk in families bearing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A mutation: implications for genetic counseling.","pubmedId":"25064638"}
