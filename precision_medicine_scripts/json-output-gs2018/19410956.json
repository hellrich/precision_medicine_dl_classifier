Bilateral panuveitis, hearing loss, vitiligo, poliosis, and alopecia developed in the patient, requiring local ophthalmic immunosuppressive therapy. The clinical course, diagnostic testing, and therapeutic interventions over a 2-year period are reviewed.\nVisual acuity, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation, optical coherence tomography findings, serial electro-oculograms (EOGs), microperimetry (MP-1) testing, flow cytometric analysis of cells derived from the aqueous humor, and aqueous humor cytokine profiles were evaluated.\nAfter melanoma immunotherapy, complete tumor regression was achieved at 5 months after treatment with a durable, ongoing, complete remission at 24 months. Early in the treatment course, a high fever, a diffuse rash, hearing loss, and bilateral anterior uveitis developed acutely in the patient. Late autoimmune sequelae included the development of alopecia, vitiligo, poliosis, and bilateral panuveitis with diffuse retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hypopigmentation, reminiscent of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome. Bilateral cystoid macular edema also developed that was responsive to acetazolamide. Serial EOGs showed alterations in RPE standing potentials in dark conditions, and MP-1 testing revealed diminished foveal and perifoveal sensitivity. An aqueous humor aspirate revealed a high concentration of melanoma tumor antigen-reactive T cells compared with that of peripheral blood samples, as well as a proinflammatory aqueous cytokine profile. At the time of cataract surgery 22 months after immunotherapy, a repeat aqueous humor sample showed the disappearance of the previously seen melanoma differentiation antigen-reactive lymphocytes, but the proinflammatory cytokine profile persisted.\nOcular and systemic autoimmune sequelae resembling VKH may develop after successful melanoma immunotherapy. This report provides insight into the pathogenesis of VKH disease. The patient\u0027s clinical course illustrates the fine balance between tumor-specific immunity and loss of self-tolerance.\nThe author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.","title":"Ocular and systemic autoimmunity after successful tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte immunotherapy for recurrent, metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"19410956"}
