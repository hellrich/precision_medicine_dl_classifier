Gene alterations were also examined. All of the esophageal carcinoma cell lines expressed mRNA for EGFR and TGF-alpha genes. Interestingly, EGF mRNA of about 5.0 kb was also detected in TE-1, TE-2, and TE-8 cells. Production of protein was also confirmed by binding assay and ELISA on 3 of the 6 cell lines. The cells had a relatively high number of EGFRs and produced TGF-alpha and EGF protein at the same time. Furthermore, anti-EGF (KEM-10) and anti-TGF-alpha (WA-3) monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) inhibited spontaneous uptake of tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) by TE-1 cells which expressed EGF, TGF-alpha and EGFR mRNA and protein. These results strongly suggest that EGF and/or TGF-alpha produced by carcinoma cells function as autocrine growth factors for human esophageal carcinomas.","title":"EGF and TGF-alpha, the ligands of hyperproduced EGFR in human esophageal carcinoma cells, act as autocrine growth factors.","pubmedId":"2298497"}
