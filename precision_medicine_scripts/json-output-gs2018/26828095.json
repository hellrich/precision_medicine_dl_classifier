Due to the ageing of the population, diagnosis in the elderly is becoming more common. The aim of this study was to analyse different combinations of treatments and to identify preoperative factors, including O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase status, that may be associated with decreased survival among patients older than 70 years. Methods and materials We retrospectively included all patients over 70 years of age, who underwent surgery at the Department of Neurosurgery (HUCA and HUMV) and were diagnosed of GBM by pathological criteria from January 2007 to September 2014. Results Eighty-one patients were analysed, whose mean age was 75 (SD 4) and 48 were male. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was over 70 in 61 patients and 38.3% presented with motor deficit. Sixty-three patients underwent resection, and 18 had only a diagnostic biopsy. The complication rate was 17.28% and mortality rate was 7.4%. Survival was increased in patients who received radiotherapy (n \u003d 41) or additional chemotherapy (n \u003d 26) (p \u003c 0.001). KPS \u003c 70 was an independent factor associated with low-rate survival. Patients with optimal treatment had a median survival of 8 months compared to patients with suboptimal treatment who had a median survival of 4 months (p \u003c 0.001). Conclusions This study suggests that KPS is the most important preoperative prognostic factor. Maximal safe resection followed by radical radiotherapy and temozolomide might be the optimal treatment of choice since glioblastoma-diagnosed patients over 70 years of age showed a statistically significant survival benefit.
