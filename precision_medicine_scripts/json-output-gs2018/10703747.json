Multiple adenomas (tubular or tubulovillous) the numbers of which decreased in the aboral direction occurred in the small intestine. Two tubulovillous adenomas with dysplastic nuclei but with no invasion were found in the right colon. The morphological and histochemical findings resembled those of human colorectal tumours. Activities of brush border enzymes and sucrase immunoreactivity were decreased to various extent or were not present at all. The findings fluctuated even within the same section. Activities of enzymes of pericellular proteolysis were slightly increased in comparison with non affected mucosa. This model is suitable and deserves further studies.","title":"Are intestinal tumours in Apc+/-mice a suitable model of colorectal carcinoma in man?","pubmedId":"10703747"}
