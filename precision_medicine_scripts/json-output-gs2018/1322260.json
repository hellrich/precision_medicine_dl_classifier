The fine-needle aspiration cytomorphology has not yet been described. A renal cystic mass in a 56 year old female was aspirated under ultrasound guidance. Papanicolaou stained smears of the cyst fluid revealed markedly atypical cells forming papillary clusters. Subsequent nephrectomy showed a typical cystic nephroma with lining epithelium resembling that seen in the aspirate. The cytomorphology of cystic nephroma has been misdiagnosed as renal cell carcinoma in the literature. Low cellularity, absence of necrosis, and paucity of single cells are features that should raise the possibility of cystic nephroma in a cystic renal mass.","title":"Fine-needle aspiration of cystic nephroma (multilocular cyst of the kidney).","pubmedId":"1322260"}
