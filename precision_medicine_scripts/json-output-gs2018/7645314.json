This recently developed procedure promises rapid and effective treatment of anxiety related complaints, including post-traumatic stress disorders (DSM-III-R). In essence the therapist induces a series of rapid and rhythmic eye-movements. EMDR facilitates cognitive changes and lasting decrease of anxiety.
