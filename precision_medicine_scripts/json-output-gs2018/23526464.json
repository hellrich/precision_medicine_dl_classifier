Ponatinib (AP24534) is an oral ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is in advanced clinical experimentation in leukemia.\nWe tested whether ponatinib inhibited RET kinase and oncogenic activity.\nPonatinib activity was studied by an in vitro RET immunocomplex kinase assay and immunoblotting. The effects of ponatinib on proliferation of human TT, MZ-CRC-1, and TPC-1 thyroid carcinoma cells, which harbor endogenous oncogenic RET alleles, and of NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with oncogenic RET mutants were determined. Ponatinib activity on TT cell xenografted tumors in athymic mice was measured.\nPonatinib inhibited immunopurified RET kinase at the IC₅₀ of 25.8 nM (95% confidence interval [CI] \u003d 23.15-28.77 nM). It also inhibited (IC₅₀ \u003d 33.9 nM; 95% CI \u003d 26.41-43.58 nM) kinase activity of RET/V804M, a RET mutant displaying resistance to other tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Ponatinib blunted phosphorylation of point-mutant and rearranged RET-derived oncoproteins and inhibited proliferation of RET-transformed fibroblasts and RET mutant thyroid carcinoma cells. Finally, after 3 weeks of treatment with ponatinib (30 mg/kg/d), the volume of TT cell (medullary thyroid carcinoma) xenografts was reduced from 133 mm³ to an unmeasurable size (difference \u003d 133 mm³, 95% CI \u003d -83 to 349 mm³) (P \u003c .001). Ponatinib-treated TT cell tumors displayed a reduction in the mitotic index, RET phosphorylation, and signaling.\nPonatinib is a potent inhibitor of RET kinase and has promising preclinical activity in models of RET-driven medullary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"Ponatinib (AP24534) is a novel potent inhibitor of oncogenic RET mutants associated with thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"23526464"}
