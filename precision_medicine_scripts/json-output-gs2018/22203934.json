The purpose of this study was to determine if the total gangliosides serum levels might predict the tumor growth in patients with melanoma or if the transfer of shed cell gangliosides reflects the implication in the clinical prognostic of these patients.\nTotal gangliosides serum levels were measured in the cryopreserved serum by estimating lipid-associated sialic acid in 761 patients before surgical resection of melanoma, in 406 patients with precancerous pigmentary lesions, and in 410 healthy individuals. This study was performed at the Dermatovenereological Research Center, Bucharest, Romania, during 1991-2010. All sera obtained after surgical resection of melanocytic tumors were analyzed to see if adjuvant therapy (chemo-, immuno-, immunochemo-therapy) induced gangliosides changes in melanoma patients and if the responses were correlated with survival.\nTotal gangliosides serum levels were higher in melanoma patients than in precancerous melanocytic lesions patients or in healthy individuals. Larger tumors in Breslow index and more advanced stage of disease were correlated with higher total gangliosides serum values. Augmented total gangliosides serum levels after melanoma adjuvant treatment were predictive for decreased overall survival, whereas decreased total gangliosides serum levels were predictable for improved overall survival.\nA marker for early melanoma complications and survival may be the total gangliosides serum level.","title":"Serum total gangliosides level: clinical prognostic implication.","pubmedId":"22203934"}
