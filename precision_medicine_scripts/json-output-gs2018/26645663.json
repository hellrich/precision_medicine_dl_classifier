In ERBB2-amplified breast cancer, the hyperactivation of this signaling cascade is associated with resistance to ERBB2-targeted therapy. This can occur through gain-of-function alterations or compensatory mechanisms that enter into play upon pharmacological pressure. The strong rationale in combining anti-ERBB2 agents with PI3K/AKT inhibitors, together with the identification of genomic alterations conferring sensitivity to targeted inhibition, are guiding the design of clinical studies aimed at preventing the emergence of drug resistance and achieving more durable response. In the present review, we describe the involvement of this pathway in breast cancer pathogenesis, with an emphasis on AKT kinases, and provide insight into currently available targeted agents for the treatment of ERBB2-amplified breast cancer. Finally, we provide preliminary data on a novel AKT3 mutation detected in the context of resistance to anti-ERBB2 therapy as an example of genomics-based approaches towards uncovering novel actionable targets in this setting.
