The traditional cancer treatments have high levels of toxicity and relatively low efficacy. Current research and clinical trials have indicated that virotherapy, a procedure which uses replication-competent viruses to kill cancer cells, has less toxicity and a high efficacy. However, the interaction dynamics of the tumor host, the virus, and the immune response is poorly understood due to its complexity. We present a mathematical analysis of models that study tumor-immune-virus interactions in the form of differential equations with spatial effects. A stability analysis is presented and we obtained analytical traveling wave solutions. Numerical simulations were obtained using fourth order Runge-Kutta and Crank-Nicholson methods. We show that the use of viruses as a cancer treatment can reduce the tumor cell concentration to a very low cancer dormant steady state or possibly deplete all tumor cells in body tissue. The traveling waves indicated an exponential increase and decrease in the cytotoxic-T-lymphocytes (CTLs) density and tumor load in the long term respectively.
