Only 19 cases of ETV6/ABL1-positive hematological malignancy have been published, diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, other types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm, acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study reports three new cases (aged 8 months, 5 years, and 33 years) of ALL with the ETV6/ABL1 fusion found by screening 392 newly diagnosed ALL patients (335 children and 57 adults). A thorough review of the literature and an analysis of all published data, including the three new cases, suggest poor prognosis of ETV6/ABL1-positive acute leukemias. The course of the disease in the two pediatric patients is characterized by minimal residual disease monitoring, using quantification of both the ETV6/ABL1 transcript and immunoreceptor gene rearrangements. Eosinophilia could not be confirmed as a hallmark of the ETV6/ABL1-positive disease. Studies of neonatal blood spots demonstrated that, in the child diagnosed at five years, the ETV6/ABL1 fusion initiating the ALL originated prenatally.","title":"Acute leukemias with ETV6/ABL1 (TEL/ABL) fusion: poor prognosis and prenatal origin.","pubmedId":"20589932"}
