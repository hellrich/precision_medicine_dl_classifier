Therefore he was started on ipilimumab in a dose of 3Â mg/kg body weight four times in intervals of 3 weeks. Subsequently, there was an almost complete regression of distant metastases. In several phase III trials a significant survival benefit has been identified for patients treated with ipilimumab. The human monoclonal antibody has been approved since July 2011 as a second-line treatment in Germany and was incorporated in January 2013 into the new guidelines for the treatment of malignant melanoma. The CTLA-4 antibody is the first drug that can improve significantly survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. In advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma, immunostimulatory treatment with ipilimumab represents a new therapeutic option.","title":"[Metastatic malignant melanoma.
