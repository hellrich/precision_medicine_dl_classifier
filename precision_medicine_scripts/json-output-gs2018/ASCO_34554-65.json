Identifying predictive markers may help select advanced melanoma pts most likely to benefit from ipilimumab therapy. Biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment are thought to be more relevant for predicting response than those in the peripheral blood. Methods: We examined tumor biopsy markers in a Phase II study CA184004 (ipilimumab 3 and 10 mg/kg). Ipilimumab was administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) x 4; eligible pts could receive ipilimumab Q12W starting Wk 24. Pre- and post-treatment (Wk 4) tumor biopsies were performed for hematoxylin and eosin analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); immunohistochemistry of FOXP3 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO); and mRNA expression profile analysis. Response was assessed with modified World Health Organization criteria. Associations between tumor biomarkers and clinical activity (complete response, partial response, or stable disease  24 wks) were assessed. Results: Ipilimumab 3 or 10 mg/kg was administered to 40 and 42 pts, respectively. In tumor biopsies, clinical activity was associated with high expression of FOXP3 (P \u003d 0.014) and IDO (P \u003d 0.012) at baseline and an increase from baseline in TILs (Wk 4) (P \u003d 0.005) (Table). Tumor mRNA profiling identified genes with significant changes from baseline in expression, or with baseline expression levels that may be associated with clinical activity. These included various immune response genes and known melanoma antigens. Conclusions: Biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment have been demonstrated to be associated with clinical activity in pts treated with ipilimumab.
