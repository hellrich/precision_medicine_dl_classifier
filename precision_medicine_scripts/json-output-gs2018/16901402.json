The most important signaling pathways in melanoma lie downstream of NRAS: the RAS-BRAF-MAPK pathway. A great deal of attention has been focused on the high mutation rate in the BRAF oncogene, which approaches 60%, because BRAF itself is an appealing drug substrate and because of the central contribution of BRAF function to melanoma development that the mutation rate signifies. Agents that specifically target BRAF, such as sorafenib, as well as new molecules that function both upstream and downstream of BRAF, are being actively investigated.","title":"Therapeutic targets in melanoma: map kinase pathway.","pubmedId":"16901402"}
