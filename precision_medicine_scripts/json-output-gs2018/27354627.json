We examined the effect of resveratrol on vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells.\nA vemurafenib-resistant human metastatic melanoma cell line positive for the BRAF V600E mutation was established. The anti-tumorigenic effects of vemurafenib and resveratrol, both alone and in combination, were examined through analysis of cell proliferation and protein expression.\nThe level of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) was increased in the primary melanoma cells after treatment with vemurafenib, and the basal level of p-AKT was increased in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells. Notably, resveratrol both alone and in combination with vemurafenib effectively suppressed cell proliferation and AKT phosphorylation in both parental and vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells.\nVemurafenib resistance can be reversed by addition of resveratrol in patients undergoing treatment with BRAF inhibitors.","title":"Resveratrol Overcomes Cellular Resistance to Vemurafenib Through Dephosphorylation of AKT in BRAF-mutated Melanoma Cells.","pubmedId":"27354627"}
