It is still unknown why some patients respond and others do not. Tumor cells can evade the immune system, for example through interference with antigen presentation by down-regulation of MHC molecules or expressing proteins interfering with cytotoxic lymphocyte-induced apoptosis like the granzyme B antagonist protease inhibitor 9 (PI-9).\nPI-9 expression was detected in melanoma cell lines. To investigated if PI-9 is important in the response to ASI, paraffin-embedded tissues from stage III or IV melanoma patients were stained.\nPI-9 is expressed in melanoma cells and expression in metastasized melanoma cells is, in this group of patients, an adverse prognostic marker with regard to overall and disease-free survival. Moreover, loss of MHC-1 expression frequently occurs during tumor progression but is not associated with poor clinical outcome. Interestingly, melanoma patients with a favorable clinical outcome after ASI therapy usually have high percentages of activated (granzyme B-positive) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes at time of first diagnosis and low percentages of activated lymphocytes at time of recurrent tumor.\nExpression of PI-9 in metastatic melanoma cells is associated with unfavorable clinical outcome whereas MHC-1 down-regulation is not. Although it cannot be proven that PI-9 expression is directly responsible for failure of immunotherapy, these data suggest that expression of PI-9 could be an important immune escape mechanism and that modulation of this inhibitor may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.","title":"Expression of the apoptosis inhibitor protease inhibitor 9 predicts clinical outcome in vaccinated patients with stage III and IV melanoma.","pubmedId":"16144945"}
