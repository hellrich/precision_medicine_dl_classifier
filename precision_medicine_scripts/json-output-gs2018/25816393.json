Vulvar tumors represent only 4% of all gynecological neoplasms, and they are fourth in frequency after tumors of the cervix, uterus, and ovary. Ninety-eight percent of all vulvar tumors are benign and only 2% are malignant. Sarcomas of the vulva comprise approximately 1-3% of all vulvar cancers. They are characterized by rapid growth, high metastatic potential, frequent recurrences, aggressive behavior, and high mortality rate. In Part 1 of this paper, we presented the most common forms of sarcoma of the vulva: leiomyosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor, and rhabdomyosarcoma. The second part of this review will focus mainly on the rarest variants of vulvar sarcoma: low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, monophasic synovial sarcoma, carcinosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, myeloid sarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and malignant mesothelioma.
