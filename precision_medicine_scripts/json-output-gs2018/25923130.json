Extensive efforts have been made to characterize molecular events associated with these tumors, including the identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Increased copy number gain and amplification of c-Met, the cell surface receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, has been shown to enhance tumor growth and invasiveness and promote metastasis in certain tumor types. In this study, we evaluated the expression of c-Met by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a large cohort of salivary gland ACCs and examined its clinicopathologic implications. Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks from 200 ACC patients were used in this study. Pathologic patterns and phenotypic expression of c-Met were recorded and compared with clinical factors including gender, age, disease stage at diagnosis, and clinical outcomes. Correlations between c-MET expression and clinical characteristics were assessed by Pearson\u0027s chi-square test or by the 2-tailed Fisher exact test. Curves describing overall survival were generated by Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Strong c-MET expression was seen in inner ductal and outer myoepithelial cells in 53.2% of the cases. There was no correlation between c-Met overexpression and clinicopathologic parameters or patient\u0027s overall survival ( p \u003d .94074). In conclusion, c-MET expression is high in a significant subgroup of ACC patients. While c-MET expression is not a prognostic factor in ACC, its role as a predictive marker of benefit from MET inhibitors deserves further investigation.
