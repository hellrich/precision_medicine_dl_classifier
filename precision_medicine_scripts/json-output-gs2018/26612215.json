Markers of genetic susceptibility to PCA, recurrent epigenetic and genetic alterations, including ETS gene fusions, PTEN alterations, and urine-based early detection marker PCA3, are discussed. Impact of recent genome-wide assessment on our understanding of key pathways of PCA development and progression and their potential clinical implications are highlighted.
