We examined whether the sizes of FLT3/ITDs were associated with clinical outcomes in 151 AML patients enrolled in Southwest Oncology Group studies: S9333 and S9500. FLT3/ITDs were identified in 32% of patients (median ITD size \u003d 39 nucleotides; range, 15-153 nucleotides). The CR rates were 35%, 67%, and 52% for patients with large (\u003eor\u003d 40), small (\u003c 40), and no ITDs, respectively (P \u003d .19). Increasing ITD size was associated with decreasing OS (estimated 5-year OS: large \u003d 13%, small \u003d 26%, and no ITD \u003d 21%, P \u003d .072) and RFS (estimated 5-year RFS: large \u003d 13%, small \u003d 27%, and no ITD \u003d 34%, P \u003d .017). These studies suggest that ITD size may have prognostic significance.","title":"Size of FLT3 internal tandem duplication has prognostic significance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"16368883"}
