A report is given about indication, performance and results of neutron therapy in 16 patients treated between 1976 and 1987 at the Radiological University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf. Neutron therapy proves to be of great efficiency, especially in case of adenoid cystic carcinomas as well as highly differentiated adenocarcinomas and sarcomas.","title":"[Radiotherapy results in malignant tumors of the inner nose and paranasal sinuses with special reference to neutron therapy].","pubmedId":"2545010"}
