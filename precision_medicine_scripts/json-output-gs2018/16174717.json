Associations of BRAF mutation with initial tumor characteristics and subsequent recurrence were analyzed.\nRelationships between the BRAF mutation status and clinicopathological outcomes, including recurrence, were measured.\nWe found a significant association between BRAF mutation and extrathyroidal invasion (P \u003c 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P \u003c 0.001), and advanced tumor stage III/IV (P \u003d 0.007) at initial surgery. This association remained significant on multivariate analysis, adjusting for conventional clinicopathological predictors of recurrence excluding the histological PTC subtype, but was lost when the tumor subtype was included in the model. BRAF mutation was also significantly associated with tumor recurrence, 25 vs. 9% with and without mutation, respectively (P \u003d 0.004), during a median of 15 (interquartile range, 3-29) months of follow-up. This association remained significant on multivariate analysis adjusting for conventional clinicopathological predictors of recurrence, even including the PTC subtype (odds ratio, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-14.1; P \u003d 0.03). BRAF mutation was even an independent predictor of recurrence in patients with stage I/II disease, 22 vs. 5% with and without BRAF mutation, respectively (P \u003d 0.002). BRAF mutation was also more frequently associated with absence of tumor I-131 avidity and treatment failure of recurrent disease.\nIn patients with PTC, BRAF mutation is associated with poorer clinicopathological outcomes and independently predicts recurrence. Therefore, BRAF mutation may be a useful molecular marker to assist in risk stratification for patients with PTC.","title":"BRAF mutation predicts a poorer clinical prognosis for papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"16174717"}
