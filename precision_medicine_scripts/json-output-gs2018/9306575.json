The patient presented following the rapid onset of redness and swelling over the left anterior chest wall. On examination, the left chest wall and left axilla were extensively hard, and the left upper limb was swollen. Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scanning disclosed a mass in the left breast, about 2 cm in diameter with an unclear margin, and swelling of the major and minor pectoral muscles. Needle biopsy of the breast mass confirmed invasive lobular carcinoma. As a radical operation was considered contraindicated, systemic and intraarterial chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and Adriamycin (ADR) were performed. Nevertheless, the patient died of carcinomatous pleurisy 6 months after the initial onset of the disease.","title":"Male inflammatory breast cancer.","pubmedId":"9306575"}
