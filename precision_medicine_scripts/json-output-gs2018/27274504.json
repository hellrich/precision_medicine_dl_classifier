The aim of the present study is to analyze people\u0027s preference in Korea for timing of diagnosis and management of PTMC using an online questionnaire.\nThe questionnaire consists of 3 questions about preference for the diagnosis and management of PTMC and 3 additional questions about respondents\u0027 personal information. An online survey was conducted from March 3 to June 3 in 2015 using Google Survey (http://goo.gl/forms/b81yEjqNUA).\nA total 2,308 persons (1,246 males, 1,053 females) answered the questionnaire. Respondents\u0027 ages varied widely from teenagers to 70-year-olds. If there was a suspicious thyroid nodule from PTMC measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, 95.7% of respondents want to know a cytological diagnosis for it. If a thyroid nodule turned out to be a PTMC, 59.5% of respondents wanted it removed immediately. For surgical management of PTMC, 53.0% of respondents were worried more about recurrences than complications. In subgroup analyses, respondents younger than 40 years old more often want immediate surgery than others: 66.7% vs. 32.7% (P \u003c 0.05). Respondents who underwent thyroid cancer surgery (n \u003d 91) were worried more about recurrences than others: 69.2% vs. 52.4% (P \u003c 0.05).\nAlmost all respondents in the present study wanted diagnosis of suspicious thyroid nodules immediately. However, there were opposing opinions about the preferred timing for surgical treatment and surgical extents. A patient\u0027s right to know their disease status and decision on treatments should be emphasized all the more.","title":"An online questionnaire survey on preferred timing for the diagnosis and management of thyroid carcinoma in general population in Korea.","pubmedId":"27274504"}
