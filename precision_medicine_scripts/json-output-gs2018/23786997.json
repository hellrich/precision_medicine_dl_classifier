As with other solid tumors, lung cancer is thought to be the result of an accumulation of genetic alterations after exposure to carcinogens. The aim of the present study was to clarify the relationship between multistep carcinogenesis and the accumulation of EGFR mutations.\nThe intratumor heterogeneity of EGFR mutations was analyzed in 38 patients with resected mixed-type lung adenocarcinoma according to histological patterns, and the clinical features of the patients harboring intratumor heterogeneity of EGFR mutations were evaluated.\nIntratumor heterogeneity of EGFR mutations was detected in 9 of 38 tumors. EGFR mutations were more common in the bronchioloalveolar (lepidic) carcinoma pattern than in the papillary and acinar patterns, although this difference was not significant. However, there was a significant correlation between intratumor heterogeneity of EGFR mutations and smoking history (P \u003c .043).\nIntratumor heterogeneity of EGFR mutations correlates with the distribution of histological subtype in mixed type adenocarcinoma and is associated with smoking history.","title":"Analysis of intratumor heterogeneity of EGFR mutations in mixed type lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23786997"}
