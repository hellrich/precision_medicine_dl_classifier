The DNA nondiploid carcinomas were significantly more common from the left (descending and sigmoid) colon and the rectum. A poorer prognosis was found for patients with DNA nondiploid cancers than for patients with DNA diploid cancers. This was particularly true for patients with Dukes\u0027 stages B2 and C tumors with a small number (one to three) of lymph nodes with metastatic deposits. The DNA nondiploid cancers also had a relatively poorer prognosis in patients with unresectable disease. In a Cox multivariate analysis model, the DNA pattern was an independent prognostic variable for this group of 264 patients with resected colorectal carcinoma.","title":"Colorectal cancer.
