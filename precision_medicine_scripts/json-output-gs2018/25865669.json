Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the relationship between mutational status, drug response and survival.\nOver 70% of patients received two or more lines of chemotherapy, 50% had cetuximab and 18% had bevacizumab. The prevalence of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations was 45, 3.2, 5 and 20%, respectively. For the entire cohort, the median overall survival was 24 months (95% confidence interval [CI] \u003d 20.4-26.4 months). Of the genes tested, only KRAS mutation was an independent prognostic factor with a multivariate hazard ratio of 1.5 (95% CI \u003d 1.05-2.16, P \u003d 0.03). In the subgroup of patients who received cetuximab-based therapy in the first-line setting, KRAS mutation was associated with a lack of response to chemotherapy (28% vs 66%, chi-square, P \u003d 0.01). Patients with KRAS mutant tumors (or KRAS wild-type tumors that harbored BRAF and/or PIK3CA mutations) tended to have lower response rates to chemotherapy and/or cetuximab (P \u003d not significant). The number of NRAS mutant cases was too small to allow any statistical analysis.\nThe prevalence of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in this cohort is consistent with reports from non-Asian populations, and KRAS mutation has both prognostic and predictive significance in Chinese patients with metastatic CRC.","title":"Elucidating the prognostic significance of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"25865669"}
