This case benefitted from very detailed CT-scanning (IDM) with characteristic images obtained from the thorax and bilateral renal tumours suggestive of angiomyolipomas. This association seems to be quasi-pathognomic of the disease. The discovery at CT-scanning of cerebral calcification raises a possible connection of LAM with Bourneville\u0027s tuberous sclerosis. This CT-scanning study has several points of interest: the early diagnosis of pulmonary lesions which are under evaluated by standard radiography; a complete inventory of the possible localisations of the disease; it enables a possible diagnosis in very frail patients in whom a lung biopsy would be a risk; an ability to assess further progress as there also exists a good correlation between the extent of the disease assessed by TDM and the disturbance in pulmonary function.","title":"[The contribution of computerized tomography to the diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis.
