In all, 66 malignant melanomas were diagnosed, including 50 superficial spreading melanomas, seven lentigo maligna melanomas, eight nodular melanomas, and one acral lentiginous melanoma. Persons with red hair and skin type I/II were at increased risk of developing malignant melanoma. Superficial spreading melanomas excised during the study period had a significant lower histological thickness compared with those lesions excised before the study period.","title":"[Prevention and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"9691797"}
