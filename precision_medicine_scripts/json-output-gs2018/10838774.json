Both patients had been previously treated surgically with a 40 g bone cement filling with 2 g of methotrexate. Revision surgical intervention was necessary because of loss of stability at the fracture site in a 68 year old female after with a metastasis from breast cancer after 8 weeks and in a 72 year old male with metastasis from cancer of the prostate after 10 weeks. During revision surgery the metal plates and the cement were removed. Tissues samples from the fracture site were taken for histopathologic examination. Fibrosis of connective tissue and haemosiderin accumulation were noted in the soft tissues surrounding the fractures site. Where there was direct contact between the bone cement and bone, necrosis of bone trabeculae and granuloma like bodies were noted. Revision surgery 10 weeks after the first procedure revealed more advanced bony necrosis. No cancerous tissue was observed in any of the cases.","title":"[Morphology of a lithic lesion of the bone treated with cement filling with the addition of methotrexate].","pubmedId":"10838774"}
