Histological examination showed an acral lentiginous melanoma, Clark level IV, thickness of 2.3 mm. Follow-up for 7 years showed no signs of recurrence or metastasis.\nThe association between malignancy and chromoblastomycosis is very uncommon, but medical staff who deal with this disease should be attentive to this possibility, as early detection of these neoplasms will provide an adequate treatment, improving survival and quality of life for those patients.","title":"Melanoma in a long-standing lesion of chromoblastomycosis.","pubmedId":"17076718"}
