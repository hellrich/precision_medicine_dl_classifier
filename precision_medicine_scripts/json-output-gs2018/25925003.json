Segmental Chromosome Aberrations (SCAs) were observed in 29 tumors (85%) namely 1p imbalance (58%), 17q gain (52%), 9p loss (32%), 11q loss (30%), 1q gain (17%), 7q gain (17%), 2p gain (14%), 3p loss (14%), and 4p loss (7%). MYCN amplification and MYCN gain were detected in 3 (10%) and 2 cases (7%) respectively. An anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene mutation study on the available cases from this cohort revealed 4/25 (16%) mutated cases. In parallel, alpha thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X linked (ATRX) gene mutations were also sought, a novel mutation being detected in 1/21 (4,7%) cases.\nThis study confirmed the low incidence of MYCN amplification in AYA and recorded a high frequency of 17q gain and 9p and 11q loss independently from the stage of the disease. The presence of 1q gain, which identifies patients with particularly aggressive disease, relapse and poor survival, was also detected. Furthermore, the frequency of ALK mutations suggests that a target-based therapy with ALK inhibitors might be effective in this subset of patients.","title":"Genetic abnormalities in adolescents and young adults with neuroblastoma: A report from the Italian Neuroblastoma group.","pubmedId":"25925003"}
