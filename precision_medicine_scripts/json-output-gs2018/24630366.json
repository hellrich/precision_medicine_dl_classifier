The failure to achieve molecular negativity shortly after starting TKI has been demonstrated to be predictive of relapse, suggesting that an accurate measurement of low BCR-ABL1 levels may have a role in preventing hematological relapse. Despite the big efforts made by many European laboratories within the European Study Group, at the time of writing a standardized procedure to quantify and express results is still missing for BCR-ABL1-positive ALL. In this study, in order to detect with high sensitivity low levels of BCR-ABL1 transcripts, we used a new technology and a new molecular approach based on microfluidic digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) using Taqman chemistry and we compared obtained results with those generated by the conventional method based on reverse transcriptase PCR reaction (RQ-PCR) for BCR-ABL1 and total ABL1, with TaqMan chemistry and with Applied Biosystems instrument. We demonstrated the dPCR is high-sensitive (able to detect a single copy of BCR-ABL1) and reliable (results are comparable to those obtained by BCR-ABL1 quantification with conventional technology), allowing an accurate monitoring of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL patients in complete remission.
