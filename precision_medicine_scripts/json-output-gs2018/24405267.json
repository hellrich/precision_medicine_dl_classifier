However, the mechanism of PD-L1-mediated inhibitory signalling after PD-L1 cross-linking by anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or PD-1-immunogloblin fusion protein (PD-1-Ig) is still unknown, although it may induce cell death of PD-L1(+) cells required for regular immune reactions. In this study, PD-1-Ig or anti-PD-L1 mAb treatment was tested in cell lines that expressed PD-L1 and bovine lymphocytes to investigate whether the treatment induces immune reactivation or PD-L1-mediated cell death. PD-L1 cross-linking by PD-1-Ig or anti-PD-L1 mAb primarily increased the number of dead cells in PD-L1(high) cells, but not in PD-L1(low) cells; these cells were prepared from Cos-7 cells in which bovine PD-L1 expression was induced by transfection. The PD-L1-mediated cell death also occurred in Cos-7 and HeLa cells transfected with vectors only encoding the extracellular region of PD-L1. In bovine lymphocytes, the anti-PD-L1 mAb treatment up-regulated interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production, whereas PD-1-Ig treatment decreased this cytokine production and cell proliferation. The IFN-γ production in B-cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells was not reduced by PD-1-Ig treatment and the percentages of dead cells in PD-L1(+) B cells were increased by PD-1-Ig treatment, indicating that PD-1-Ig-induced immunosuppression in bovine lymphocytes could be caused by PD-L1-mediated B-cell death. This study provides novel information for the understanding of signalling through PD-L1.
