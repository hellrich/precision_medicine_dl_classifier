For example, recent knock-in mouse studies have shown that MDM2 heterooligomer formation with its homolog, MDMX, is necessary and sufficient in utero to suppress p53 but is dispensable during adulthood. However, despite crucial advances such as these, several aspects regarding basic in vivo functions of MDM2 remain unknown. In one such example, although abundant evidence suggests that MDM2 forms homooligomers and heterooligomers with MDMX, the function and regulation of these homo- and heterooligomers in vivo remain incompletely understood. In this review, we discuss the current state of our knowledge of MDM2 oligomerization as well as current efforts to target the MDM2 oligomer as a broad therapeutic option for cancer treatment.","title":"MDM2 oligomers: antagonizers of the guardian of the genome.","pubmedId":"27041565"}
