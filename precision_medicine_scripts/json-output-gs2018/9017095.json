The ICSI procedure displays high fertilization and pregnancy rates in cases of extreme oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. In combination with sperm aspiration from the epididymis or sperm retrieval by testicular sperm extraction, fertilization is possible even in cases of azoospermia. To date, a couple of thousand children have been born after ICSI. Despite the criticism about the lack of natural selection while breaking the zona pellucida and the cytoplasmic membrane with the injection pipette, there has been no increased incidence of malformations and chromosomal abnormalities.","title":"Assisted fertilization--treatment of severe male subfertility.","pubmedId":"9017095"}
