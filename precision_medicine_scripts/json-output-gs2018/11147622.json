In the current study the diagnostic methods, pathology, and results of the surgical treatment of early hilar and peripheral nonsmall cell lung carcinoma cases defined by Japanese criteria are presented.\nBetween 1977 and 1998, 43 patients with early hilar lung carcinoma were encountered. These patients constituted 14.5% of 200 hilar lung carcinoma patients who underwent resection during the same period. Between 1973 and 1998, there were 174 early peripheral lung carcinomas, which comprised 14.8% of 1173 peripheral lung carcinoma patients who underwent resection during the same period.\nThe 5-year and 10-year survival rates of the early hilar lung carcinoma were 100% and 96.9%, respectively. The majority of the patients underwent bronchoplastic surgery, such as sleeve lobectomy and parenchymal-sparing surgery including seven sleeve segmentectomies and two second carinal resections. The effectiveness of the parenchymal-sparing resections was assessed by the conventional pulmonary function test as well as perfusion and ventilation scanning. There were 174 cases of peripheral early lung carcinoma among the 218 cases of peripheral lung carcinoma with tumor dimensions of \u003c or \u003d 2 cm. The cell types were 142 (81.6%) cases of adenocarcinoma, 18 (10.3%) cases of squamous cell carcinoma, and 14 (8%) cases of other cell types. These 174 patients comprised 14.8% of 1173 patients with peripheral nonsmall cell lung carcinoma who underwent surgery during the same period. The 5-year and 10-year survival rates for adenocarcinoma were 89.6% and 86.8%, respectively. The 5-year and 10-year survival rates for other cell types were both 71.8%. The overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 86.8% and 84.6%, respectively.\nEarly lung carcinoma in both the hilar and peripheral regions, is curable if it is properly diagnosed and treated.","title":"Surgical management of early stage central (hilar) and peripheral nonsmall cell lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11147622"}
