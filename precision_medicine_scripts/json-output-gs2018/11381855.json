Yet, the overall incidence has consistently risen in the past 20 years. Thus, the likelihood that our pediatric patients will develop malignant melanoma is increasing. Previously, the bulk of lesions were estimated to occur in children with large congenital melanocytic nevi. Recent reports, however, have highlighted new risk factors for malignant melanoma in children, while demystifying other entities previously believed to have a grave prognosis. Knowledge of risk factors and participation in public health efforts toward prevention and early intervention can help the practitioner protect pediatric patients from this malignancy.","title":"Update on malignant melanoma in children.","pubmedId":"11381855"}
