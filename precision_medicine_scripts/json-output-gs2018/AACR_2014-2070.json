Simultaneously targeting multiple members of the HER family may increase the therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report the ability to image the therapeutic response obtained by targeting the HER family members individually or simultaneously using novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) mixtures.Mice with subcutaneous BxPC-3 pancreas adenocarcinomas were divided into five groups (n\u003d8) receiving vehicle or mAb mixtures directed against HER1 (EGFR), HER2, HER3, or pan-HER. Small animal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT was performed at baseline and day 1 or 2 after initiation of therapy. The changes in tumor uptake of tracers were quantified and related to the efficacy of each therapy on tumor size measured by caliper. Imaging results were further validated by immunohistochemistry on tumor samples obtained 2 and 7 days after initiation of therapy.The pan-HER mAb mixture showed the greatest efficacy with significant smaller tumor volumes (14639 mm3, Mean SEM) compared with the other groups (vehicle: 66099 mm3, EGFR: 36367 mm3, HER2: 45845 mm3, HER3: 27437 mm3) at the end of therapy (day 23). Mean FDG and FLT uptake in the pan-HER group decreased by 194.3% and 243.1%, respectively, at day 1 or 2 compared with baseline, which was significantly greater than for the other groups. Importantly, the early change in mean FDG and FLT uptake correlated with tumor growth at day 23 relative to day 0 (r\u003d0.67, p\u003c0.001; r\u003d0.63, p\u003c0.001, respectively).In conclusion, we demonstrate the ability to image therapeutic responses to a novel pan-HER mAb mixture using PET/CT imaging with FDG and FLT. We suggest the use of FDG and FLT PET/CT as an imaging biomarker in clinical evaluation of the pan-HER mAb mixture.","title":"In vivo imaging of therapy response to novel antibody mixtures targeted at the human epidermal growth factor receptor family using FDG and FLT positron emission tomography","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2070"}
