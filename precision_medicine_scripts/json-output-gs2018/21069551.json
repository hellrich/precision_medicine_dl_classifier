A number of reports have consistently demonstrated that mucosal and acral melanomas more commonly harbor KIT-activating mutations than do other subtypes. Success in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors with imatinib has led to speculation that KIT-mutated melanoma might also be effectively managed using this approach. A 78-year-old woman presented with a 4-month history of rectal bleeding. A colonoscopy revealed a black polypoid mass, 30 mm in diameter, originating near the dentate line, and a biopsy revealed malignant melanoma. Computed tomography showed multiple liver and lung metastases. A KIT mutation analysis showed the L576P mutation in exon 11. The patient did not want to undergo chemotherapy including a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, so palliative radiotherapy for rectal symptoms was performed, but the patient died 4 months later due to disease progression. We describe the first case of anorectal melanoma with a KIT-activating mutation in Japan and summarize findings from the literature regarding the efficacy of KIT kinase inhibitors on this melanoma subtype.","title":"Anorectal melanoma with a KIT-activating mutation, which is a target for tyrosine kinase inhibitor.","pubmedId":"21069551"}
