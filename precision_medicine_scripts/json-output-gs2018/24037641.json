Eighty-six cases of STACC included 45 females and 41 males, aged 12-91 years (mean 54.4 years). Patients presented most frequently with obstructive symptoms (n \u003d 54), followed by epistaxis (n \u003d 23), auditory symptoms (n \u003d 12), nerve symptoms (n \u003d 11), nasal discharge (n \u003d 11), and/or visual symptoms (n \u003d 10), present for a mean of 18.2 months. The tumors involved the nasal cavity alone (n \u003d 25), nasopharynx alone (n \u003d 13), maxillary sinus alone (n \u003d 4), or a combination of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses (n \u003d 44), with a mean size of 3.7 cm. Patients presented equally between low and high stage disease: stage I and II (n \u003d 42) or stage III and IV (n \u003d 44) disease. Histologically, the tumors were invasive (bone: n \u003d 66; neural: n \u003d 47; lymphovascular: n \u003d 33), composed of a variety of growth patterns, including cribriform (n \u003d 33), tubular (n \u003d 16), and solid (n \u003d 9), although frequently a combination of these patterns was seen within a single tumor. Pleomorphism was mild with an intermediate N:C ratio in cells containing hyperchromatic nuclei. Reduplicated basement membrane and glycosaminoglycan material was commonly seen. Necrosis (n \u003d 16) and atypical mitotic figures (n \u003d 11) were infrequently present. Pleomorphic adenoma was present in 9 cases; de-differentiation was seen in two patients. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive reactions for pan-cytokeratin, CK7, CK5/6, CAM5.2, and EMA, with myoepithelial reactivity with SMA, p63, calponin, S100 protein and SMMHC. CD117, CEA, GFAP and p16 were variably present. CK20 and HR HPV were negative. STACC needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of most sinonasal malignancies, particularly poorly differentiated carcinoma, olfactory neuroblastoma and pleomorphic adenoma. Surgery (n \u003d 82), often accompanied by radiation therapy (n \u003d 36), was generally employed. A majority of patients developed a recurrence (n \u003d 52) 2-144 months after initial presentation. Overall mean follow-up was 19.4 years (range 0.4-37.5 years): 46 patients died with disease (mean 6.4 years); 5 were alive with disease (mean 5.4 years), and 35 patients were either alive or had died of unrelated causes (mean 16.3 years). ACC of the SNT is uncommon. Recurrences are common. The following parameters, when present, suggest an increased incidence of either recurrence or dying with disease: mixed site of involvement, high stage disease (stage IV), skull base involvement, tumor recurrence, a solid histology, perineural invasion, bone invasion, and lymphovascular invasion.","title":"Sinonasal tract and nasopharyngeal adenoid cystic carcinoma: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic study of 86 cases.","pubmedId":"24037641"}
