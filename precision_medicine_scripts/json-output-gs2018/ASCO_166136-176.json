There are no specific therapies for NRAS melanoma. Despite emergence of immunotherapies (ITs) as effective treatments in melanoma, there is a high unmet need in these pts, particularly after failure of IT. Methods: In this open-label phase III study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01763164), pts with advanced unresectable/metastatic cutaneous NRAS-mutant melanoma who were previously untreated or had progressed on/after prior IT were randomized 2:1 to BINI 45 mg PO BID or DTIC 1000 mg/m2 IV every 3 wk. Pts were stratified by stage, ECOG PS and prior IT for unresectable/metastatic disease. Progression-free survival (PFS) per independent central review was the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS) was the key secondary endpoint; other secondary endpoints included confirmed overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Results: 402 pts were randomized to BINI (n \u003d 269) or DTIC (n \u003d 133). The planned primary PFS analysis and prespecified analyses by IT strata and LDH level at screening (median mo and HR with 95% CIs) are presented in the table below. Confirmed ORR and DCR (95% CI) were 15% (11%20%) and 58% (52%64%) for BINI vs 7% (3%13%) and 25% (18%33%) for DTIC (P\u003d 0.015 [ORR]; P\u003c 0.001 [DCR]), respectively. Median duration of response on BINI was 6.9 mo. A prespecified interim analysis of OS favored BINI, with a point estimate for the HR of 0.81; mature OS analysis will be performed at 224 deaths. Grade 3/4 adverse events reported in  5% of pts in either group were increased CPK (19% BINI, 0% DTIC), hypertension (7% BINI, 2% DTIC), anemia (2% BINI, 5% DTIC) and neutropenia (1% BINI, 9% DTIC). Conclusions: BINI showed improvements over DTIC in several clinically relevant endpoints including PFS, ORR and DCR, was well tolerated and may offer a new treatment option for pts with NRAS-mutant melanoma before and after IT.
