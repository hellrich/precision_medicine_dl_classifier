CRs were significantly more frequent (P less than 0.01) in regimens A (9.3%) and C (16.4%) compared with regimen B (1.1%). No significant difference in terms of CR plus PR was detected among the three regimens. In all regimens a higher number of CRs plus PRs was seen in patients with soft tissue metastases only, compared with those who had visceral involvement. In all three regimens patients achieving CR showed a longer duration of response and survival in comparison with patients achieving PR. The incidence of brain metastases was neither lowered nor delayed by the presence of BCNU in regimens A and C.","title":"Comparative evaluation of three combination regimens for advanced malignant melanoma: results of an international cooperative study.","pubmedId":"1000518"}
