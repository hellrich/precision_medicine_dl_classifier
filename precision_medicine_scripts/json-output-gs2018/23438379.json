Virtually all the major principles of \"tumor immunology\" have been experimentally established in this model. It is now amply clear that melanoma cells display multiple antigens and peptide epitopes that are targetable by the host immune system and that patients with melanoma are capable of responding to these antigens and epitopes serologically as well as through the cell-mediated mechanisms. The immune responses against melanoma are, however, subject to regulation by the regulatory processes within the immune system itself and melanoma cells can resort to overt evasive activities. Indeed, the intrinsic as well as the extrinsic mechanisms within the immune system that are designed to control the magnitude as well as the duration of immune responses at times act as constraints against generating a robust and long-lasting antimelanoma response and melanoma cells are capable of using all the tricks (eg, downregulation of targetable molecules, elaboration of immunosuppressive cytokines) available to living organisms so as to evade immune recognition and destruction. As a result, the immune system often fails to protect the host against melanoma development and progression. The cumulative knowledge over the years on melanoma-associated antigens and epitopes, on methods of immunization, and on technologies for generating melanoma antigen-specific T cells, natural or engineered, have led to the development of immunotherapeutic strategies with \"melanoma vaccines\" and with T-cell-based adoptive immunotherapy for melanoma. Although these strategies have not been uniformly successful in all cases, durable complete regressions of metastatic melanoma can at times be obtained with active specific immunization or adoptive cell therapy. There is reason for hope that continued research in the field is likely to improve the outcome of melanoma immunotherapy: the ultimate goal of tumor immunology.","title":"Immunology of melanoma.","pubmedId":"23438379"}
