The antitumor activity of vandetanib monotherapy or vandetanib with paclitaxel and carboplatin (VPC) was compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin (PC) in previously untreated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nAll NSCLC histologies and previously treated CNS metastases were permitted in this partially blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II study. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1:1 to receive vandetanib, VPC, or PC. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point, and the study was powered to detect a reduced risk of progression with VPC versus PC (hazard ratio \u003d 0.70; one-sided P \u003c .2) and to demonstrate noninferiority for vandetanib versus PC. Overall survival was a secondary assessment.\nThe risk of progression was reduced for patients receiving VPC (n \u003d 56) versus PC (n \u003d 52; hazard ratio \u003d 0.76, one-sided P \u003d .098); median PFS was 24 weeks (VPC) and 23 weeks (PC). The vandetanib monotherapy arm (n \u003d 73) was discontinued after a planned interim PFS analysis met the criterion for discontinuation (hazard ratio \u003e 1.33 v PC). Overall survival was not significantly different between patients receiving VPC or PC. Rash, diarrhea, and hypertension were common adverse events; no pulmonary or CNS hemorrhage events required intervention.\nVPC could be safely administered to patients with NSCLC, including those with squamous cell histology and treated brain metastases. Compared with the PC control arm, patients receiving VPC had longer PFS, meeting the prespecified study end point, whereas those receiving vandetanib monotherapy had shorter PFS.","title":"Randomized phase II study of vandetanib alone or with paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"18936474"}
