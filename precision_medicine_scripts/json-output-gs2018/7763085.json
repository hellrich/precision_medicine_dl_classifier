In the present study, we examined 60 cases of primary melanoma to compare the expression of p53 protein with conventional prognostic markers for melanoma such as clinical and histological parameters. No correlation was found between the p53 protein and clinical factors except for the presence of a metastatic node and development to clinical stage II. However, the expression of p53 protein was significantly associated with tumour thickness over 1.5 mm, levels IV and V of invasion, the presence of ulceration, and high mitotic rate for 5-year survival rate. Although many questions still remain to be answered, our results and those of others for various other malignant tumours, implicate p53 in malignant transformation of pigment cells. Indeed, it could be a new marker for an unfavourable prognosis of malignant melanoma, even though the gene mutation in this highly lethal tumour has yet to be established.","title":"Expression of the p53 protein in malignant melanomas as a prognostic indicator.","pubmedId":"7763085"}
