While such spinal meningeal spread of intracranial glioblastoma is considered rare, it appears that such involvement is not uncommon if specifically investigated. The incidence of meningeal seeding by primary intracranial glioblastoma may be expected to rise as new therapies are directed toward the primary tumor.","title":"Spinal leptomeningeal invasion from intracranial glioblastoma multiforme.","pubmedId":"6295337"}
