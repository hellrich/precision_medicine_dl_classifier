We distinguish different melanoma subtypes on the basis of genetic mutations such as BRAFV600E and we can therefore hypothesize the existence of corresponding morphological patterns that might be detected in vivo by noninvasive diagnostic tools such as dermoscopy and confocal microscopy. Eight BRAFV600E mutated melanomas (six primary and two metastases) were collected, matched in terms of age, sex, and thickness wild-type controls, and analyzed. In this preliminary study, regression, corresponding to fibrosis and melanophages in the dermis, was the predominant pattern and was also observed confocally when dermoscopy showed no peppering. In particular, confocal microscopy could not only detect regression but also provided a semiquantitative analysis of its grade through the count of melanophages. Confocal microscopy can be proposed as a useful tool in the preliminary screening and characterization of BRAFV600E mutated melanomas, providing new insights for patients\u0027 screening and follow-up.
