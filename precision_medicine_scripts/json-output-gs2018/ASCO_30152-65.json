Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 10,176 gastric patients from 1990-2003 who underwent curative gastrectomy from the SEER database. Survival curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed with log-rank test. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors related to survival was performed by the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: The lymph node ratio (LNR) was a strong predictor of survival. LNR was equally predictive of survival whether the analysis was restricted to patients with \u003c15 lymph nodes dissected or \u003e15 lymph nodes dissected. Survival of patients with a LNR of 0.1-5% was not significantly different than node negative patients; however, survival of patients with a LNR of 5-10% was significantly different than node negative patients. Multivariate analysis showed that LNR, T-stage, tumor size, and number of lymph nodes positive were independent prognostic predictors of death and that LNR was the strongest predictor for death. Multivariate analysis showed that the number of lymph nodes dissected was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Moreover, LNR was an independent prognostic factor for N1 and N2 patients by AJCC staging. LNR trended toward significance in AJCC N3 patients. Conclusions: LNR was the strongest predictor of death in gastric cancer patients when compared to T-stage, number of lymph nodes positive, and tumor size. LNR is equally predictive regardless of the adequacy of the lymph node dissection.","title":"Lymph node ratio and survival for gastric cancer: A retrospective analysis of the SEER database.","pubmedId":"ASCO_30152-65"}
