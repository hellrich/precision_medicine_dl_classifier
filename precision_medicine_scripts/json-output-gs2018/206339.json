The response rate was 33% with an additional 14% showing no response or stable disease. At a dose of 1.2 gm/M2 daily for 5 days every 4 weeks, 57% of 14 patients responded with 35% showing no response or stable disease. The majority of the patients (28) had epidermoid carcinoma. Two (7%) had complete response with 9 (32%) showing partial responses. Other responses included 1/2 oat cell carcinomas and 3/6 large cell undifferentiated carcinomas. Toxicity was equal in both regimens for nausea, vomiting, increased serum LDH and neutropenia but the 5 day program had significantly less hemorrhagic cystitis. Survival was greatly influenced by response. There was no statistical difference in overall length of response between responders and the non responding/stable disease patients. But these two groups had a very significant survival advantage when compared to those patients with increasing disease. Similarly, there was a significant improvement in response duration for the low dosage regimen. Therefore, the low dose 5 day regimen is recommended because of its response rate, it has less hemorrhagic cystitis and it has better patient acceptance in that it can be given as an outpatient and does not require a Foley catheter.","title":"Ifosfamide in the treatment of recurrent or disseminated lung cancer: a phase II study of two dose schedules.","pubmedId":"206339"}
