Polymerase chain reactions and single-stranded conformational polymorphism analyses were used to examine 140 elderly AML patients enrolled in the Southwest Oncology Group study 9031 for FLT3, RAS, and TP53 mutations, which were found in 34%, 19%, and 9% of patients, respectively. All but one of the FLT3 (46 of 47) mutations were internal tandem duplications (ITDs) within exons 11 and 12. In the remaining case, a novel internal tandem triplication was found in exon 11. FLT3 ITDs were associated with higher white blood cell counts, higher peripheral blast percentages, normal cytogenetics, and less disease resistance. All RAS mutations (28 of 28) were missense point mutations in codons 12, 13, or 61. RAS mutations were associated with lower peripheral blast and bone marrow blast percentages. Only 2 of 47 patients with FLT3 ITDs also had a RAS mutation, indicating a significant negative association between FLT3 and RAS mutations (P \u003d.0013). Most TP53 mutations (11 of 12) were missense point mutations in exons 5 to 8 and were associated with abnormal cytogenetics, especially abnormalities in both chromosomes 5 and 7. FLT3 and RAS mutations were not associated with inferior clinical outcomes, but TP53 mutations were associated with a worse overall survival (median 1 versus 8 months, P \u003d.0007). These results indicate that mutations in FLT3, RAS, or TP53 are common in older patients with AML and are associated with specific AML phenotypes as defined by laboratory values, cytogenetics, and clinical outcomes.
