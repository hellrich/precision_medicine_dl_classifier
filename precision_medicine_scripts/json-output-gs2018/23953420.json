Methylation status of the PTCH1 promoter was also investigated by bisulfite sequencing.\nSomatic mutations of PTCH1 were detected in 3 KCOTs. Two out of 3 somatic mutations were either identified as a polymorphism or located on the same allele as the germline mutation. Neither abnormal methylation of the PTCH1 promoter, loss of PTCH1, nor somatic mutation of SMO or SUFU was detected in any of the samples.\nOur results suggest that the tumorigenesis of most KCOTs associated with NBCCS cannot be explained by the classical 2-hit theory.","title":"Molecular pathogenesis of keratocystic odontogenic tumors developing in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.","pubmedId":"23953420"}
