Methods:    We collected information on all consecutive breast cancer patients operated at the European Institute of Oncology between 1994 and 2005. The tumor characteristics and subsequent outcome of patients who experienced local and regional recurrence was analyzed.  Results:    279 patients with LRR were identified, 197 and 82 patients with local and regional recurrence respectively. The overall discordance rate between primary cancer and LRR was 9% for ER expression, 22% for PgR and 4% for HER2. Among patients with local recurrence the risk of subsequent relapse and death  was significantly higher in those with early (\u003c 2 years) compared to delayed local recurrence [HR for PFS 3.34 (1.86-6.00); HR for OS 2.29 (1.47-3.55)]  Patients with triple negative breast cancer at LRR experienced an higher risk of subsequent relapse [HR 2.87 (1.67-4.91)] and death  [HR 2.00 (1.25-3.19)].  Conclusions:    LRR correlates with a high risk of subsequent events and death in particular in  patients with triple negative subtype. Treatments to prevent subsequent events  may be most efficiently studied in populations with triple negative breast cancer.","title":"Breast cancer subtypes and outcome after local and regional relapse.","pubmedId":"ASCO_77217-102"}
