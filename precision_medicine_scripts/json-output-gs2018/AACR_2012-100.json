Specifically, accumulating evidence suggests that overexpression and altered activity of FAKs promotes tumorigenesis, metastasis, and correlates with reduced survival. Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2, FAK2) and its role in physiological processes in bone and inflammatory cellular responses have been well-documented. Recently, the role of PYK2 in the induction of endothelial to mesenchymal transition and cancer progression has emerged. Somatic mutations altering the coding region of PTK2B have been detected in melanoma and lung cancer, but the functional significance of these mutations is unknown. Here we demonstrate that cancer-associated mutations of PYK2 found in malignant melanoma lead to altered protein localization, interactions, and activity, and consequently, abnormal cellular behavior. These findings suggest that somatic mutations in PTK2B may promote tumor progression through deregulated protein activity, and highlight the importance of evaluating PYK2 inhibitors to block both the normal and mutant forms of the kinase.","title":"Somatic mutations in Pyk2 in melanoma alter protein activity, interactions and localization","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-100"}
