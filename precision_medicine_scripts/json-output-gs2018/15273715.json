A series of 60 PTCs collected in a single center from Italian patients were histologically re-examined and subclassified as well differentiated or tall cell variant. The sample collection was analysed for the presence of all the reported PTC-associated genetic alterations through DNA or cDNA amplification, followed by automated sequencing. The analysis of exons 11 and 15 of BRAF gene revealed the T1796A (V599E) mutation in 32% of cases, and this alteration is significantly associated with PTC tall cell variant. Oncogenic rearrangements of RET and NTRK1 receptors were found in 33 and 5% of cases, respectively. No Ras mutations were detected. Overall, genetic alterations were detected in two-thirds of samples, and in no single case more than one mutational event was found simultaneously. Gene expression profiling of a subset of 31 tumors performed using cDNA microarray chips showed no strong differences in global gene expression among the different cases. However, a supervised analysis of the obtained data identified a subset of genes differentially expressed in tumors carrying BRAF mutation or RTK rearrangement.","title":"Alternative mutations of BRAF, RET and NTRK1 are associated with similar but distinct gene expression patterns in papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"15273715"}
