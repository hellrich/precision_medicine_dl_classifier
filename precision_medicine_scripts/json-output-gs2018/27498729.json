{"genes":["ALK","anaplastic lymphoma kinase","ALK","HLA locus"],"organisms":["9606","9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Pediatric anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a chemosensitive malignancy, but about 30% of patients experience relapse. In most of these patients, a second complete remission is obtainable with salvage chemotherapy, though relapse free survival rates are as low as 30-60%. Herein, we report a 6-year-old boy with relapsed anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive ALCL successfully treated with vinblastine monotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), with a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen, from his father. One HLA locus from the father was mismatched. The boy had neither severe graft-versus-host disease nor transplantation related complications. He is currently well and has remained disease free for 10 months, to date, since transplantation. Allo-HSCT with a RIC regimen may be a promising treatment strategy for relapsed ALK positive ALCL based on obtaining graft-versus lymphoma effects as well as reducing transplantation-related mortality.
