With over 10 years of long-term treatment with imatinib and several years of experience with the next generation of TKIs, including nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib, it is becoming clear that many clinical parameters have great impact on the prognosis of patients with CML. Emerging novel gene expression profiling and molecular techniques also provide new insights into CML pathogenesis and have identified potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. This review presents the supporting data and discusses how certain clinical characteristics at diagnosis, the depth of early response, the presence of certain kinase domain mutations, and additional molecular changes serve as prognostic factors that may guide individualized treatment decisions for patients with CML-CP.","title":"Biomarkers for determining the prognosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia.","pubmedId":"23870290"}
