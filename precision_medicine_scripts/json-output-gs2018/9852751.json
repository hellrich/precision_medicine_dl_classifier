A 69 year-old female with RA was admitted because of gall bladder cancer, and also had selective IgA deficiency which serum IgA level was less than 5.0 mg/dl, and IgA 1 and IgA 2 subclasses were not detected. Prior to the operation, she was given red cell compatible blood transfusion because of severe anemia. After 30 min of transfusion, she developed chill, nausea, vomiting and hypotension. These anaphylactic reactions might be induced by the presence of anti-IgA antibody, since the level of this antibody titers in her serum was elevated, assessed by the methods of ELISA and Western blotting. Although a case of RA associated with selective IgA deficiency, and also with elevated serum anti-IgA antibody level is extremely uncommon, attention should be paid to the presence of anti-IgA antibody in patients with selective IgA deficiency to avoid any unexpected anaphylactic reactions.","title":"[A case report of selective IgA deficiency in rheumatoid arthritis and anti-IgA antibody induced anaphylactic transfusion].","pubmedId":"9852751"}
