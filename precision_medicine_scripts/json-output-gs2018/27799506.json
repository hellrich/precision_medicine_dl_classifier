However, some patients will experience tumor recurrence and/or malignant progression. This article reports on the clinical history, molecular findings, and treatment response in a patient with BRAF V600-mutated high-grade glioma arising from ganglioglioma.\nHematoxylin-eosin staining and comprehensive genomic profiling via Foundation One were performed on the tumor sample from a male patient undergoing treatment at the Department of Neuro-Oncology at Baylor University Medical Center.\nThe patient was eligible for participation in a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00916409) of a tumor treatment fields (TTFields) device, NovoTTF-100A, with concurrent radiation and chemotherapy (CCRT). His disease relapsed 4 months after completion of his CCRT, with MRI showing areas of enhancement. Temozolomide was discontinued and he was offered dabrafenib, an oral selective inhibitor of BRAF V600E, with continued use of NovoTTF. At the time of this report, after 2 years of treatment with dabrafenib and TTFields, the patient shows a durable complete response in all areas with no active lesions or new areas of enhancement.\nThis report suggests that TTFields delivered in combination with targeted therapy dabrafenib yielded a remarkable clinical and radiologic response in this recurrent high-grade glioma. Targeted therapy matched to genomic alterations combined with TTFields treatment could provide clinical benefit and should be prospectively explored in the near future.","title":"Personalized Treatment for a Patient With a BRAF V600E Mutation Using Dabrafenib and a Tumor Treatment Fields Device in a High-Grade Glioma Arising From Ganglioglioma.","pubmedId":"27799506"}
