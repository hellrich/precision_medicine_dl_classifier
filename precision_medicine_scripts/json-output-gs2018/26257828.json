{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"The aim was to describe the association of awareness and knowledge with participation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.\nTelephone survey research was conducted with South Carolina (USA) residents aged 50-75 years using a 144-item instrument. Data were analyzed with SAS and Stata. Adjusted odds ratios are reported.\nRespondents (n \u003d 1302) had heard of CRC screening (96%) and exhibited high levels of CRC awareness and knowledge; only 74% had ever been screened. Higher levels of knowledge were associated with a greater likelihood of having ever been screened (odds ratio: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02-1.41; p \u003c 0.001).\nResults showed high levels of awareness and knowledge, but modest participation in CRC. Transforming awareness and knowledge into CRC screening participation should be a priority.","title":"Relationship of colorectal cancer awareness and knowledge with colorectal cancer screening.","pubmedId":"26257828"}
