We performed a comprehensive analysis of clonal-subclonal frequencies of driver alterations in unpaired prim (prim) vs metastatic (met) CRC and studied their potential clinical implications. Methods: 642 CRC samples with targeted mut analysis from 2010-2015 (Sequenom in 469, MiSeq in 173; prim in 496, met in 110). MAFs of each variant were normalized for tumor purity in the sample. Non-parametric statistics and Cox models are described. Results:APC mut were found in 50% (median MAF 0.5; reference group for comparisons), TP53 mut in 65% (0.67; p \u003d .035), KRAS mut in 46% (0.56; p \u003d .2), NRAS mut in 4% (0.51; p \u003d .9), BRAF mut in 8% (0.28; p \u003c .001) and PIK3CA mut in 16% (0.39; p \u003c .001). Half of samples with KRAS/PIK3CA coexisting mut had significantly lower PIK3CA than KRAS MAFs (0.27 [n \u003d 34] vs 0.46 [n \u003d 39]; p \u003c .001). We only found higher MAFs in met vs prim after chemo +/- anti-EGFR for TP53 (0.77 [n \u003d 70] vs 0.56 [n \u003d 32]; p \u003d .004) and BRAF (0.44 [n \u003d 8] vs 0.26 [n \u003d 42]; p \u003d .04). BRAF MAFs were higher in non-V600 than V600 (0.45 [n \u003d 5] vs 0.27 [n \u003d 48]; p \u003d .02). In 31 patients (pts) treated with 41 anti-BRAF regimens, no correlation between BRAF V600 MAFs and time to treatment failure was found (p \u003d .36). Pts with any RAS mut tumors, irrespective of MAFs, had worse time from recurrence to death (TRD) as compared to RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wild-type (43 vs 34 months [m], HR 1.39; p \u003d .004), but coexisting PIK3CA mut, either clonal or subclonal, did not further impact survival (31 m and 35 m, HR 1.07; p \u003d .7). Pts with BRAF V600 mut had worse TRD (21 m, HR 2.2; p \u003c .001), but not those with BRAF non-V600 mut (46 m, HR 1.35; p \u003d .55). Conclusions: Our results indicate clonality of RAS mut and subclonality of BRAF V600 mut and a subset of PIK3CA mut. Differences in prim vs met sites for TP53 and BRAF V600 MAFs suggest acquired copy number events and clonal selection after therapy. BRAF V600 MAFs in prim tissue did not predict benefit with targeted drugs in met setting. Despite significant differences in prognosis according to mut in driver oncogenes, their clonality patterns did not influence survival.","title":"Clonality patterns of driver mutations (mut) to reveal spatial-temporal genomic heterogeneity in colorectal cancer (CRC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_165373-176"}
