Inguinal lymph node metastases were present initially. Paget\u0027s cells, intradermal tumor cells, and metastatic tumor cells showed similar reactions to a variety of histochemical stains and positive results with immunohistochemical staining using carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Control sections in cases of Bowen\u0027s disease and superficial, spreading malignant melanoma showed a negative staining reaction with CEA, providing further evidence that this technique is useful in distinguishing Paget\u0027s disease (PD) from histologically similar conditions. We provide a summary of previous cases of EMPD arising in unusual locations and a brief consideration of possible mechanisms of the origin of PD.","title":"Extramammary Paget\u0027s disease.
