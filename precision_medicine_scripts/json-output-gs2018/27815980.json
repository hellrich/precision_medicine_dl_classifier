The compounds were characterized by elemental analysis and by UV-Visible, fluorescence, IR, 1H, 13C and 119Sn NMR spectroscopies. Solid state structures of dibutyltin(IV) compounds 1-3, 6 and 7 were accomplished from single crystal X-ray crystallography which reveal the common ladder-type structure with two endo- and two exo-Sn atoms. The redox properties of LnHH\u0027 (n\u003d2-4, 7 and 8) and their diorganotin(IV) compounds 1-3, 6 and 7 were also investigated by cyclic voltammetry. In general, the dibutyltin(IV) derivatives exhibited significant in vitro cytotoxic potency towards A375 (melanoma) and HCT116 (colon carcinoma) cell lines as determined by several experiments, like Live and Dead assay, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cell viability assay, LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), cleavage of caspases and PARP (poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase), and DNA fragmentation. Dibutyltin(IV) compounds increase cell death without cytolysis and decreases membrane fluidity, without interfering with p53. Among the dibutyltin(IV) compounds, compound 6 was found to be the most potent, with an IC50 value of 78nM. A mechanism of action for tumor cell death is proposed.","title":"New dibutyltin(IV) ladders: Syntheses, structures and, optimization and evaluation of cytotoxic potential employing A375 (melanoma) and HCT116 (colon carcinoma) cell lines in vitro.","pubmedId":"27815980"}
