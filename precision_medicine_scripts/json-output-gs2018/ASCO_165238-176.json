Methods: Under an IRB-approved protocol clinical and pathological data were collected for a retrospective cohort of CM pts with clinical molecular testing performed by a next gene sequencing panel from April 2012 to November 2014. Muts were assessed for associations with pt demographics, melanoma characteristics, and clinical outcomes. Significance of observed associations were determined by Fishers exact, Kaplan Meier and log rank testing. Results: Among 929 CM pts, 43% had V600, 21% had NRAS, 19% had TP53 and 7% had NonV600 muts. TP53 muts were detected in 11% of pts with V600 muts, 19% of pts with NRAS muts and 29% of pts without V600 or NRAS muts (WT). NonV600 muts were detected in 1% of V600 pts, 4% of NRAS, and 15% of WT. TP53 muts were associated with increased age at diagnosis (p \u003d 0.02) and primary tumor site (p \u003d 0.0001), with increased frequency of head and neck tumor location. Pts with TP53 mut had longer overall survival (OS) from stage IV on univariate analysis (p \u003d 0.04), and on multivariate analysis (p \u003d 0.026) that included gender, stage, and LDH. Improved OS with TP53 mutation was not observed in pts with a V600 mut (p \u003d 0.89), and TP53 mut was not associated with outcomes in V600 pts treated with approved BRAF inhibitors. NonV600 muts correlated with older age at diagnosis (p \u003d 0.005), but no other pt demographic, tumor characteristic, or OS from stage IV. None of the NonV600 mut pts treated with approved BRAF inhibitors (n \u003d 11; 1 with concurrent MEK inhibitor) had an objective response. Conclusions: TP53 muts were significantly associated with longer OS from stage IV in this large cohort of CM pts, and should be evaluated other melanoma patient cohorts. BRAF NonV600 mutations were not associated with primary tumor characteristics or OS.","title":"Pathological and clinical features of non-acral cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients (pts) with TP53 and BRAFNon-V600 (NonV600) mutations (muts).","pubmedId":"ASCO_165238-176"}
