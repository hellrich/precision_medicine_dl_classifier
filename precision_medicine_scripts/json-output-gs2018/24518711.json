While there is ample data in the world literature about the clinical features and outcome of this disease, prognosis in Indian patients is largely unknown.\nTo study the clinical, pathologic profile and outcome ALCL.\nFifty patients who had pathologically proven diagnosis of systemic ALCL at our institute from June 2003 to May 2011 were included for retrospective analysis. This included 30 cases of anaplastic lymphoma kinase+ (ALK+), ALCL and 20 cases of anaplastic lymphoma kinase- (ALK-), ALCL. The hospital protocol for treatment of these patients included CHOP chemotherapy regimen in \u003e15 years of age and MCP842 protocol with vinblastine for 1 year in \u003c15 years of age. Event free survival was noted. These outcomes were correlated with ALK status, International Prognostic Index (IPI) score, and stage at presentation.\nAt a median follow-up of 36 months (range: 6-72 months) ALK- ALCL had a poor outcome. The 3 year event free survival in pediatric ALCL was 66.7%. In adults, this was 60% ALK+ ALCL was 60% and 20% in ALK- ALCL.\nSystemic ALCL is an aggressive disease. CD3 + positivity is commonly seen in ALK- ALCL and ALK+, epithelial membrane antigen + positivity is seen in ALK+ ALCL. ALK- ALCL, advanced stage III, IV and high IPI score were associated with poor prognosis. The demographic profile and outcome in our study was similar to the world literature. With new drugs like crizotinib and brentuximab vedotin the future looks very promising.","title":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma: a single institution experience from India.","pubmedId":"24518711"}
