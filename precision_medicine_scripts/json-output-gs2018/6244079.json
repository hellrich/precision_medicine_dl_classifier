All patients were operated on and a histologic diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme was made. Patients were randomly placed in one of three treatment schedules within 3 weeks of surgery: Group A: combined radiation therapy and drug (CCNU) therapy (26 cases); Group B: CCNU given orally every 6-8 weeks (27 cases); Group C: standard radiation therapy alone (50 cases). All patients were periodically controlled by clinical and instrumental (EEG, scan, EMG, CAT) evaluations; laboratory data examinations were also frequently performed. The treatment results have been evaluated according to length of survival, social quality of life, and positive or negative response to chemotherapy. In our opinion the clinical findings are interesting but the statistical results are somewhat negative, especially when the groups of patients are not homogeneous.","title":"CCNU-chemotherapy of hemispheric supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.","pubmedId":"6244079"}
