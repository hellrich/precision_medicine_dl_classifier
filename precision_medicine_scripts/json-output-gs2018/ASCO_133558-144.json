Up to 20% of breast and gastric cancer show ERBB2 gene amplification and anti-HER2 targeting therapies are well established for these tumors. In other tumor entities such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer and bladder cancer the fraction of ERBB2 amplified tumors is considerably lower. In contrast to breast cancer, these tumors show heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in a substantial proportion. Oncogenic EGFR mutation with subsequent EGFR amplification is a common phenomenon in lung cancer. In analogy, primary ERBB2 mutation could explain the observed heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in some tumors. Methods:  100 tumors showing ERBB2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization were examined for ERBB2 mutation: 50 breast cancer samples, including 10 cases with borderline gene amplification, 10 cases with heterogeneous gene amplification and 11 samples of metastatic lesions as well as 15 colorectal carcinomas, 12 gastric carcinomas, 12 non-small cell lung cancers and 10 urothelial carcinomas. Tumor DNA was extracted and examined for mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-23) of the ERBB2 gene by Sanger sequencing. Results:  ERBB2 mutation was found in two metastatic lesions of breast cancer, two lung cancers and two colorectal cancers. In five of these cases short in-frame insertions in exon 20 were found. In one case of a breast cancer lung metastasis a missense mutation in exon 19 (p.L755S) was detected. The semi-quantitative chromatograms show an overrepresentation of the mutations indicating a selective amplification of the mutated allele. Conclusions:  In certain tumor entities the heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification indicates a late genetic event. The finding of a concomitant mutation in ERBB2 amplified tumors might explain the heterogeneity in some of these tumors. The effect of a primary oncogenic ERBB2 mutation might be increased by selective amplification of the mutated allele resulting in an additional growth advantage. If ERBB2 amplified tumors with a primary ERBB2 mutation also benefit from an HER2 targeted therapy needs to be elucidated.","title":"Concomitant mutation and amplification of the ERBB2 (HER2) gene in human tumors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_133558-144"}
