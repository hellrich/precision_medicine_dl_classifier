Although he did not feel any pain, recurrence of joint fluid collection and severe instability prevented him from standing and walking. Deficit in superficial sensation and bathyesthesia below the level of Th10, and tendon reflexes of extremities were seen. Romberg test was positive. Laboratory data showed no abnormal findings. We performed bilateral TKA based on the diagnosis of Charcot arthropathy. At 3-year follow-up, there is no complaint about joint instability and collection of joint fluid.","title":"Bilateral TKA for Charcot arthropathy associated with multiple levels of spinal canal stenoses: A case report and review of literature.","pubmedId":"27829729"}
