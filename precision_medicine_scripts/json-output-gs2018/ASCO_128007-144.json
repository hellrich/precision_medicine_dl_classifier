A reliable method to determine whether PD-1 on T cells has engaged its ligand B7-H1  on tumor cells is highly desirable as it may have significance as a predictive marker for PD-1 targeted therapy.   Methods:    Endogenous tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells were identified by their high expression of PD-1 and CD11a CD8+ T cells and their expression of Bim,  a pro-apoptotic molecule, in the peripheral blood of 26 patients with metastatic melanoma and 11 patients with metastatic prostate cancer or healthy donors using flow cytometry.  Soluble PD-L1 in patients sera was quantified using ELISA.   Results:    The target-cell engaged CD8+ T cell population was significantly higher in patients with melanoma and prostate cancer compared to healthy donors, as assessed by CD11a and PD-1  expression.   Bim expression was higher in  CD8+ T cells in both cancer patients than healthy controls (p\u003c0.01). In patients with advanced melanoma, Bim was significantly higher in the PD-1(+) target cell-engaged CD8+ T cells than the PD-1(-) CD-8+ T cells (P\u003c0.01).   Bim levels above the base line levels of healthy donors in the CD8+ T cells correlated with decreased survival in patients with melanoma (8.9 months v. 13.8  months, p\u003c0.05).  Our data suggest that the Bim level is dependent on PD-1 expression, and that higher Bim expression may be indicative of PD-1(+) CD8+ T cells which have engaged B7-H1 (PD-L1), either soluble (peripheral blood) or membrane bound (tumor cells), and are susceptible to apoptotic death.  Conclusions:    PD-1+ CD11a high CD8+ T cells identify a unique population of effector cells responsive to target tumor cells in cancer patients. Elevated Bim expression in CD8+ T cells may indicate the active immune inhibiting effects of PD-1/B7-H1 signaling on endogenous antitumor T cell responses. Bim expression can serve as a signaling biomarker for PD-1 function and may be useful in selecting patients who may benefit from checkpoint blockade therapy.","title":"A novel method for identifying downstream signals in tumor-reactive T cells following PD-1 engagement and monitoring endogenous tumor immunity and immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_128007-144"}
