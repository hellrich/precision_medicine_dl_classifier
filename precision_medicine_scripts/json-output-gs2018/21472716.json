Overall survival was analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier estimator and compared with log-rank analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify prognostic factors significant for survival.\nThe median overall survival of the entire cohort was 5.0 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4 months-5 months). Significant prognostic factors in the univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis were Karnofsky performance status (â‰¥70% vs \u003c70%; P \u003c .001), number of BM-MM (single vs multiple; P \u003c .001), pretreatment levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (normal vs elevated; P \u003c .001) and S-100 (normal vs elevated; P \u003c .001), prognostic groups according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (class I vs class II vs class III; P \u003d .0485), and treatment choice (for the cohort with single BM-MM only) (stereotactic radiotherapy or neurosurgical metastasectomy vs others; P \u003d .036). Cox proportional hazards models revealed pretreatment elevated level of serum LDH (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.0 [P \u003d .00013]) and number of BM-MM (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.0 [P \u003d .00011]) to be independent prognostic variables in the entire cohort, whereas in patients with a single BM-MM, treatment choice (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9 [P \u003d .0061]) was identified as a unique prognostic factor.\nThe overall survival of patients with BM-MM primarily depends on the number of metastases and pretreatment level of LDH. In the case of a single brain metastasis, stereotactic radiotherapy or neurosurgical metastasectomy is by far the most important factor for improving survival.","title":"Number of metastases, serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and type of treatment are prognostic factors in patients with brain metastases of malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"21472716"}
