The prevalence of RET protein expression was 62.6%. No distinct expression of p-ERK and p-p38 MAPK was demonstrated in tumor cells of papillary carcinomas. All papillary carcinomas except 5 cases expressed nuclear p-JNK and p-JNK expression was increased in tumors compared with paired normal tissues (p \u003c 0.05). There was no difference in the p-JNK expression between RET protein-positive and RET protein-negative papillary carcinomas (p \u003e 0.05). Unequivocal nuclear staining for p-AKT was demonstrated only in 10 cases of papillary carcinomas, and all of them showed focal staining. Our results showing constitutive expression of p-JNK in most cases of surgically excised papillary thyroid carcinomas irrespective of RET protein expression status suggest that JNK activation may play a role in the tumorigenesis or survival of sporadic papillary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"Expression of down stream molecules of RET (p-ERK, p-p38 MAPK, p-JNK and p-AKT) in papillary thyroid carcinomas.","pubmedId":"15119004"}
