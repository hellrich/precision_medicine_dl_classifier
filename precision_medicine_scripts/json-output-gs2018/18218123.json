A disease-specific protein marker is yet to be identified in Hodgkin lymphoma cells. In order to define HL-specific biomarkers, novel murine monoclonal antibodies were developed in our laboratory.\nMurine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) were raised against the B3 sub clone of HL-derived cell line KM-H2. Two of these mabs (clone R23.1 mab and clone R24.1 mab) are IgG1 class antibodies that recognize a 21 kDa protein present at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm in HL-derived cell lines. Clone R24.1 mab recognizes a formalin-resistant epitope and labels HRS cells in tissue samples from patients with HL of the classical type, ALCL, and subsets of T and B cell aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL). The antigen recognized by the clone R23.1 mab and clone R24.1 mab does not share epitopes with CD30 cluster regions A, B, or C, and, unlike CD30, is not expressed by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) activated T cells.\nThe 21 kDa protein detected by clone R23.1 and clone R24.1 mabs is a novel membrane-associated protein that may be a potential marker for the diagnosis and targeted therapy of HL and aggressive T and B cell NHL.","title":"Constitutive overexpression of a novel 21 kDa protein by Hodgkin lymphoma and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas.","pubmedId":"18218123"}
