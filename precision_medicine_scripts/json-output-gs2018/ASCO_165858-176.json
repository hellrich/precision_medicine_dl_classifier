In cancer, tumors evade the immune system by the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptor on activated T lymphocytes. This interaction forms the basis for the use of PD-1 inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 receptor on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) between metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM) and metastatic cutaneous melanoma (MCM). Methods: Biopsy specimens of MUM and MCM patients were analyzed for PD-L1 and PD-1 expression at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). PD-L1 expression on melanoma cells was confirmed using validated, immunohistochemical cell-surface staining with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (SP142, positivity  5% tumor cells). PD-1 expression on TILs was confirmed using the anti-PD-1 antibody (MRQ-22, positivity  1 TILs per high-power field). In total, 106 MCM and 18 MUM specimens were analyzed for PD-L1 expression, while 89 MCM and 17 MUM specimens were tested for PD-1 expression. Results: Overall, 22/106 (20.8%) MCM specimens expressed PD-L1 (Table). The highest rate of expression was seen in lung metastasis. Interestingly, all 6 of the metastatic liver lesions showed no PD-L1 expression. In comparison, none of the uveal melanoma specimens showed PD-L1 expression. PD-1 expression was seen in 68/89 (76.4%) and 9/17 (53%) of MCM and MUM specimens, respectively. Conclusions: While PD-1 expression was seen in both MUM and MCM, there was a stark difference in PD-L1 expression between them (20.8% vs. 0%; p \u003d 0.04). A complete absence of PD-L1 expression by MUM tumor cells might explain the lack of therapeutic response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and suggests an alternative mechanism via which it evades the immune system.
