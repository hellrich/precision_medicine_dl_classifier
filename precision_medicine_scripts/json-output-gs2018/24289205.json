Reports on side effects have focused on cutaneous complications. We here present a case of a severe pan-uveitis associated with vemurafenib use.\nA 63-year old female was treated with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma. After seven weeks of treatment, she developed near-complete visual loss in the course of a few days, as a result of severe uveitis. Vemurafenib had to be discontinued and systemic and topical corticosteroids were initiated. The visual symptoms improved slowly, however the cerebral metastases progressed and the patient died from her disease.\nTreatment with vemurafenib has become an important component of standard clinical care for patients with metastatic melanoma. In addition, it is one of the best examples of genotype-directed therapy. This case illustrates that vemurafenib-induced uveitis can develop fast and be slow to resolve. Awareness of this potentially severe side effect is of major importance to oncologists and aggressive treatment should be considered.","title":"Severe pan-uveitis in a patient treated with vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"24289205"}
