Clinical behavior is best predicted by size and mitotic count (risk index). KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± (PDGFRA) mutations have therapeutic and prognostic value but few other prognostically significant molecular markers have been identified. We investigated the prognostic value of p53 protein expression and MDM2 gene amplification in a series of GISTs.\nThirty-five GISTs were tested for KIT and PDGFRA mutations, p53 protein expression (high \u003e10% positive by immunohistochemistry) and MDM2 gene amplification (ratio \u003e1.8). Mitotic index (\u003e5/50 HPF), MDM2 amplification status, p53 protein expression, tumor size, and KIT/PDGFRA mutational status were correlated with clinical outcome.\nOnly a single (3%) GIST was amplified for MDM2. p53 protein expression, mitotic index, and KIT/PDGFRA mutations did not correlate with recurrence or metastasis (P\u003d0.20, 0.50, and 0.08, respectively) but tumor size did (P\u003d0.04). Risk assessment (size and mitotic index) showed a weak association with clinical behavior (P\u003d0.19).\nMDM2 amplification is uncommon in GISTs. Although high p53 expression occurred in 35% of cases, it did not correlate with clinical behavior. Only GIST size predicted clinical outcome.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: clinical significance of p53 expression, MDM2 amplification, and KIT mutation status.","pubmedId":"23060298"}
