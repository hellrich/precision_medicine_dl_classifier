The lesions were located 5 in the vulva, 2 in the vagina and 1 in the urethra. Patients had a mean age of 58.3 (range 43-80). Most of vulvar melanomas were polypoid and black, 3 of them arose in the major labium, 2 in clitoris area; histologically, four tumors were superficial spreading melanomas and one unclassifiable. Grossly, one vaginal melanoma was nodular, one polypoid, both were black and arose in the lower vagina. Urethral melanoma arose in the distal part of the organ. Prognosis of gynecological melanoma is severe, as 5 out of 8 patients died in 5-52 months.","title":"[Melanoma of the lower female urogenital tract (gynecological melanoma)].","pubmedId":"1866197"}
