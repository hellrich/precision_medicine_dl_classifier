The loss of chromosome 10q was also frequently reported in some types of soft tissue sarcomas. Our study was designed to investigate the frequency of PTEN/MMAC1 gene mutation and to evaluate the role of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in the tumorigenesis of soft tissue sarcomas without specific balanced translocations. We analyzed 51 cases of soft tissue sarcomas without specific balanced translocations for PTEN/MMAC1 mutations by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. Mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene were found in only 2 cases (3.9%). Both tumors with PTEN/MMAC1 mutation were leiomyosarcomas arising from the retroperitoneum and inferior vena cava, respectively. Two of 3 leiomyosarcomas arising from the intra-abdominal cavity examined harbored mutations of this tumor suppressor gene. This result suggests that leiomyosarcomas derived from the intra-abdominal cavity might have different tumorigenesis from those of an extremity or the trunk, from the viewpoint of PTEN/MMAC1 mutation, although PTEN/MMAC1 gene mutations are rare event in these soft tissue sarcomas.","title":"PTEN/MMAC1 gene mutation is a rare event in soft tissue sarcomas without specific balanced translocations.","pubmedId":"12569572"}
