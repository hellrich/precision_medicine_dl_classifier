Long-term follow-up of more than 2 years was detailed for each case.\nAll 4 patients responded to a single injection of bevacizumab with regression of NVI. Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) was evident in 3 cases, 2 of which had stable intraocular pressure following treatment. NVI recurred following a single injection in all patients after an interval ranging from 1 month to 12 months. A longer period of regression was seen in patients with fewer systemic neovascular risk factors and earlier treatment.\nRegression of NVI following proton beam irradiation for choroidal melanoma was seen in all treated patients. Repeated treatments may be required to maintain regression of new vessels. This treatment modality may be a useful eye-sparing adjunct in the prevention and treatment of NVG following proton beam irradiation.","title":"Intravitreal bevacizumab for iris neovascularization following proton beam irradiation for choroidal melanoma.","pubmedId":"20379286"}
