Most tumors were of the nodular type and classified as stage I according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging criteria. Surgery was performed on 22 patients, chemotherapy was administered to 7 patients, and immunotherapy was administered to 19 patients. Recurrent tumors developed in 11 patients (35.5%) during a median follow-up period of 20.2 months (range, 1 month to 18 years). The 5-year overall survival rate was 32.3%. Univariate analysis revealed that macroscopic tumor growth and the treatment method significantly affected survival outcome (p\u003d0.039 and p\u003c0.001, respectively), whereas the radicality of surgery did not (p\u003d0.296). Multivariate analysis revealed that macroscopic tumor growth (hazard ratio [HR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 12.1; p\u003d0.010) and treatment method (HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.9; p\u003d0.025) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival.\nPatients with primary vaginal melanoma have a poor prognosis. Macroscopic tumor growth and treatment method are prognostic factors for primary malignant melanoma of the vagina.","title":"Clinical outcome of 31 patients with primary malignant melanoma of the vagina.","pubmedId":"24167668"}
