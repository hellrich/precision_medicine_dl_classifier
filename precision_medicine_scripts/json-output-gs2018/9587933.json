In this study, we analyzed the frequency of p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation in exons 4-8 by PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing, and the expression of p53-protein in Ewing\u0027s sarcoma (ES) by using immunohistochemistry. The overexpression of MDM2, which acts as a functional inactivator of p53, was studied by immunohistochemistry. In addition, a screening for point mutations in the hot spot regions codon 12 and 13 of exon 1 and codon 61 of exon 2 of ras-genes (H-ras, N-ras, K-ras) was performed. In one case, a p53 gene mutation could be confirmed in codon 238 of exon 7 (1/24). Overexpression of MDM2 was found in five cases; in ras-genes, no mutations were detected. Compared with other highly malignant mesenchymal pediatric tumors such as osteosarcomas, mutations of p53 and ras in Ewing\u0027s sarcomas are an extraordinarily rare event. However, their frequency is comparable to that of PNET, suggesting that the low incidence of these mutations in ES and PNET could be group-specific for tumors of neuroectodermal genesis.","title":"p53 and ras mutations in Ewing\u0027s sarcoma.","pubmedId":"9587933"}
