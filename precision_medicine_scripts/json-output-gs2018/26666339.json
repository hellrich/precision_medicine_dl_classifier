Four hundred and sixteen patients were diagnosed with AML, between 2007 and 2011. In those aged ≤60 years (n \u003d 20) with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) overall survival (OS) was 100%. For non-APL patients aged ≤60 years, OS for those with favorable, intermediate and adverse cytogenetics was not reached, 17 and 9.8 months, respectively (p \u003d 0.0001). Of particular note, intensively treated patients aged \u003e60 years with intermediate cytogenetics and FLT3-/NPM1+ status had a five-year survival of 60% versus median OS of 11 months for other subsets (p \u003d 0.04). Population-based studies reduce selection bias and have utility in studying rarer diseases, particularly in populations that recruit poorly to trials. The highly favorable outcome in our subgroup of intensively-treated FLT3-/NPM1+ older patients merits further study.
