We hypothesizedthat relapsed/refractory CRC pts develop unique mutational signatures that guide standard and targeted therapy but also predict for therapeutic response, identify novel driver mutations and highlight key signaling pathways for clinical decision making.  Methods: Relapsed/refractory mCRC pts (N\u003d31) were molecularly profiled by NGS Caris Molecular Intelligence (IHC, FISH/CISH, NGS) and/or Foundation One (NGS, copy number). Samples were annotated by histology, primary and/or metastatic site, biopsy location, gene mutation, domain, topology, and mutation count. Web-based bioinformatics tools (Enrichr/IntAct) were utilized to analyze mutational profiles, identifying pathway-networks.    Results:  Pts included progressed on fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, cetuximab or panitumumab. Most common histology was adenocarcinoma followed by squamous cell carcinoma (colon N\u003d28; rectal N\u003d3). TP53 was the most common mutation followed by APC, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, SMAD4, SPTA1, FAT1, PDGFRA, ATM, ROS1, ALK, CDKN2A, FBXW7, TGFBR2, NOTCH1 and HER3. Pts had on average \u003e5 unique gene mutations. High mutational burden was not predictive for PD-1 (5 pts) or PD-L1 (1 pt) positivity. The most common activated signaling pathways were: ERRB2/HER2, FGFR, p38 activation through BRAF-MEK cascade via RIT and RIN, ARMS-mediatedactivation of MAPK cascade, and VEGFR2.     Conclusions: Dominant oncogene mutations do not always equate with oncogenic dependence, therefore understanding the pathologic interactome in each patient is important to both identification of clinically relevant targets and choosing the next best therapy. Mutational signatures derived from corresponding pathway-networks represent a meaningful tool to 1). Evaluate functional investigation in the laboratory, 2). Predict response to drug therapy, and 3). Guide rational drug combinations in relapsed/refractory mCRC pts entering targeted and immune checkpoint trials.","title":"Novel mutational and pathway signatures in relapsed/refractory colorectal cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_157504-173"}
