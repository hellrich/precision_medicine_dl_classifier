MET has recently been identified as a novel promising target in NSCLC, some c-MET inhibitors have been developed. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the c-MET amplification status in advanced NSCLC and compare the consistency of c-MET amplification analyses in metastatic lymph nodes and tumor tissue.Methods: Real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to test the tumor tissues in 368 patients of NSCLCs and 178 paired metastatic lymph nodes samples and compared the amplifications consistency inmetastatic lymph nodesand tissue samples, and analyzed the correlation between c-MET gene amplification and clinical characteristics of patients. Another 5 cases of normal lung tissue were taken as negative control.Results: The c-MET gene amplification rate was 8.97%(33/368) in tumor tissues . Of the178 paired cases, c-MET gene amplification was positive in 7.95%(15/178) cancerous tissuesand18.54%(33/178) in metastatic lymph nodes; Of these patients,13 were positive in the two kinds of samples. 20 cases in the paired group were detected positive c-MET in metastatic lymph nodes but was negative in cancerous tissues; 2 cases in the paired group were detected positive c-MET gene amplification in cancerous tissues but was negative in metastatic lymph nodes,there were statistically significant differences between the two samples (2\u003d 45.536, P \u003c 0.001). c-MET gene amplification was detected more in metastatic lymph nodes than the primary cancerous tissue. Consistency was evaluated by consistency test(Kappa \u003d 0.482, P \u003c 0.001).When lymph nodes were used as surrogate samples of primary cancerous tissues, sensitivity was86.67%, the specificity was 87.69%.Conclusions: More c-MET gene amplification positive were detected in metastatic lymph nodes compare with the primary cancerous tissue. c-MET gene amplification detected in lymph node metastases could screen more patients suitable for TKI therapy. Lymph node Metastasis can predict the c-MET gene amplification of primary tumor, and guide the clinical use of gene targeted drugs.","title":"Comparison of the c-MET gene amplification between primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_186389-199"}
