Since ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation involves activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and aberrant activation of MAPK/ERK is frequently observed in AML we tested the role of this pathway in modulating the cellular effects of ATRA when TOP2 is inhibited with the bisdioxopiperazines, ICRF 187 (dexrazoxane, Zinecard) or ICRF193. Treatment of HL-60 AML (M2) cells with ATRA increased the percentage of differentiated cells, as assessed by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay, and enhanced levels of phosphorylated ERK. Paradoxically, while combination treatment with ATRA/ICRF187 enhanced differentiation (P\u003c0.05), ERK phosphorylation was attenuated compared to treatment with ATRA alone. Moreover, pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059, which completely blocks ATRA-induced differentiation and ERK phosphorylation, only partially blocked (46% reduction) differentiation induced by ATRA/ICRF187 (P\u003c0.01) and had no effect on ATRA/ICRF187-induced apoptosis. In agreement with this observation, combination treatment with ATRA/ICRF187 induced apoptosis (P\u003c0.05) in KG-1 (M1) AML cells and primary AML cells from patients, that do not phosphorylate ERK or differentiate in response to ATRA treatment. In summary, our data suggest that inhibition of TOP2 sensitizes AML cells to ATRA induced differentiation and apoptosis primarily via an ERK-independent mechanism. Further, combination treatment ATRA and ICRF187 may be clinically relevant to overcome ATRA resistance in AML patients with a deregulated MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.","title":"Inhibition of topoisomerase 2 sensitizes acute myeloid leukemia cells to ATRA induced apoptosis independent of the MAPK/ERK pathway","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1186"}
