Although histone modification is shown to be an essential factor for normal stem cell maintenance, the involvement of histone demethylase in cancer progression has been poorly understood. We investigated the functional roles of the Histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase KDM5B, a crucial epigenetic regulator that is required for normal embryonic development and cell growth. KDM5B knockdown resulted in the suppression of esophageal cancer cell growth, sphere formation and invasion ability and was associated with loss of epithelial cell marker expression. These tumor inhibitory effects were reverted subsequent to subcutaneous inoculation of these cells into immune-deficient mice. These results indicated that KDM5B plays an important role in maintaining cancer stem cells and justifies the rationale for studying the effects of continuous inhibition of this epigenetic factor in esophageal cancer.","title":"KDM5B plays a central role in esophageal cancer progression","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-102"}
