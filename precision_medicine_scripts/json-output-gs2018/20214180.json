Curiously, it occurs in 8-33% of cases in black, Asian, Native American and Hispanic populations, which generally face a substantially lower risk of melanoma. Herein the authors report the case of a 69-year-old Hispanic female with a subungual melanoma of the acral lentiginous type that directly invaded the periosteum, cortex and medulla of the distal phalanx. In addition, we review published reports of acral lentiginous melanoma with osseous invasion and discuss the evidence, on a molecular level, for this entity\u0027s aggressive pattern of invasion. The review of cases is limited to those found through the PubMed search engine.","title":"Osteoinvasive subungual melanoma: a case and review.","pubmedId":"20214180"}
