This study aimed to evaluate to what extent malignant AML cells utilize NADPH-oxidase derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) as an immune evasion strategy. We report that a subset of genetically defined malignant monocytic AML cells (FAB class M4/M5), recovered from blood or bone marrow of untreated AML patients at diagnosis, express gp91phox, a component of the NADPH oxidase. These AML cells produced large amounts of ROS upon activation and triggered PARP 1-dependent apoptosis in adjacent natural killer (NK) cells, CD4+ T cells, and cytotoxic T cells. In contrast, myeloblastic (FAB class M2) or immature (FAB class M1) AML cells did not express gp91phox, did not produce ROS, and did not trigger NK or T cell apoptosis. Our data are suggestive of a novel mechanism by which monocytic AML cells evade lymphocyte immunity.","title":"Malignant monocytic AML cells trigger apoptosis in anti-leukemic lymphocytes: Role of NADPH oxidase gp91phox expression and PARP-1 activity","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5414"}
