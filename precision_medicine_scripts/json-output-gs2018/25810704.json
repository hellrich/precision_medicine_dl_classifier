Bleomycin electrochemotherapy during dabrafenib treatment was administered to control the soft-tissue progressing metastases and ensured sustained local control without significant toxicity.\nThe new combined approach maintained the patient quality of life and allowed for the prosecution of the target therapy, which proved to be still effective on systemic disease, up to 17 months.","title":"Consolidation electrochemotherapy with bleomycin in metastatic melanoma during treatment with dabrafenib.","pubmedId":"25810704"}
