In this study we aimed to analyze the expression of HAGE in large well-characterized BC cohorts to determine its relationship with other clinico-pathological parameters and to investigate its prognostic value.  Methods:    HAGE protein expression was assessed in: a) 40 normal breast tissue (NBT), b) 60 invasive BCs and their matching NBT, c) BC cell lines, d) A series of 1650 consecutive cases of primary BC who treated with adjuvant CMF and/or endocrine therapies.  Further validation was performed in 2 independent series of high risk ER- BC: a) 300 ER BC who did not received any CT and b) 396 ER- BC treated with adjuvant anthracycline (ATC) based CT.  Results:    The NBT showed negative HAGE expression (HAGE-) throughout.  HAGE overexpression (HAGE+) was observed in 10% of BC and was significantly associated with aggressive clinico-pathological features including: ER-, high grade and triple negative phenotypes.  Moreover, HAGE+ expression showed an adverse outcome with a 2-4 fold increase in the risk of death, recurrence and metastases (ps\u003c0.00001) compared to HAGE-; ps\u003c0.0001.  Using a multivariate Cox regression model including ER status, grade, size and tumour stage, HAGE expression was confirmed as a powerful independent prognostic factor (p\u003c0.0001). The poor clinical outcome of HAGE+ was further confirmed in high risk (NPI\u003e3.4) ER- patients who did not received any CT (p\u003c0.0001).  While, adjuvant CT either CMF or ATC had a positive impact on HAGE+/high risk ER- BC as HAGE+ had a similar risk of death, recurrence and distant metastases to HAGE- expression.  Conclusions:    This is the first report which shows HAGE to be a potential predictor for poor prognosis in BC patients, and may be an attractive novel target for molecular and vaccine therapy for those patients.  A prospective trial of adjuvant chemotherapy/vaccine to confirm this finding is warranted.","title":"HAGE (DDX43) protein expression as an independent biomarker of poor clinical outcome of breast cancer (BC) and potential as a therapeutic target for ER-negative BC.","pubmedId":"ASCO_101344-114"}
