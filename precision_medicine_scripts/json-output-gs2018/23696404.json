Twenty patients underwent postoperative adjuvant therapy, including chemotherapy in 14 cases, radiotherapy in 2 cases, traditional Chinese medicine therapy in 4 cases and immunotherapy in 16 cases. Postoperative follow-up was carried out in all the patients and the mean follow-up period was 27 months. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 76.3%, 39.6% and 20.6% respectively, while the 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 60.6%, 30.8% and 12.8% respectively. APR and postoperative immunotherapy could significantly reduce the local recurrence rate. According to the Kaplan-Meier method, gross type of tumor, mural involvement, lymph metastasis, and clinical staging had significant effects on overall survival, while lymph metastasis and postoperative immunotherapy on disease-free survival. Cox proportional hazards model indicated that the clinical staging and postoperative immunotherapy were significant predictive factors.\nEarly diagnosis and correct choice of surgical method are the keys to the treatment. Postoperative immunotherapy can prolong disease-free survival.","title":"[Analysis of treatment and prognosis in 34 patients with anorectal malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"23696404"}
