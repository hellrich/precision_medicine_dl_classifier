Spontaneous prostaglandin E2 production by 21 cancer cell lines, which were obtained from 17 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, was determined by radioimmunoassay. In comparison with normal keratinocyte cultures, prostaglandin E2 production by cancer cell lines was significantly decreased (p \u003c 0.0001). Prostaglandin E2 levels demonstrated no correlation to the site, stage, or histopathologic differentiation of the tumor. In a separate group of 17 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, tumor cells were isolated from fresh tumor specimens, and 24-hour PGE2 production in vitro was assayed. No correlation was found with tumor site, stage, or 2-year disease-free survival. Although prostaglandin E2 may have biologic significance in vivo in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, these findings suggest that measurements of tumor cell-derived prostaglandin E2 are not predictive of biologic behavior.","title":"Comparison of in vivo and in vitro prostaglandin E2 production by squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"8084624"}
