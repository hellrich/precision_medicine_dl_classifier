Although the most essential step in the diagnostic evaluation of soft tissue sarcomas is tumor biopsy, functional imaging techniques is growing and becoming more popular than before. PET scan traces molecular and cellular activities of normal and tumor cells through the use of radiotracers that engage in cell metabolism. The most important and widely used tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). PET scan usefulness is not limited to its ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. The scan can detect intralesional morphologic variation which is especially true in soft tissue sarcomas, it can predict tumor grade, and it is of value in staging, restaging and prognosis. As for the time, PET is not meant to replace tissue biopsy but rather complement the biopsy to better understand the biological behavior of soft tissue sarcomas.","title":"Positron emission tomography of soft tissue sarcomas.","pubmedId":"12874512"}
