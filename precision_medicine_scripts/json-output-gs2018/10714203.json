The genomic alterations important in sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis are well characterized, with loss of APC function being a frequent and early event. However, the genomic alterations in UC-related carcinogenesis are yet unclear and the role of APC is controversial. In this study genomic alterations in UC-related cancers, dysplasias and nondysplasias were assessed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Alterations of the APC/beta-catenin pathway were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. 32 cases of UC-related cancers (14 with synchronous dysplasias and nondysplasias) and 42 sporadic cancers were matched by UICC stage. CGH was performed using DOP-PCR amplification after microdissection. Expression of beta-catenin, E-cadherin and APC were detected by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections. Chromosomal alterations were present in 90% of the sporadic and 94% of the UC-related cancers. 86% of the UC-related dysplasias and 36% of the nondysplasias showed changes by CGH. Chromosome 5q was lost in 56% of UC-related cancers and 36% of the dysplasias but in only 26% of the sporadic cancers. Other frequent alterations in both cancer groups were loss of 18q, 8p, 17p, and gain of 8q and 20q. Immunohistochemistry showed a decrease of membranous and an increase of cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in UC-related and sporadic cancers. APC expression was significantly decreased in both tumor types. Clonal chromosomal alterations occur early in UC-related tumor progression. UC-related and sporadic cancers share a set of common clonal abnormalities. The frequent loss of 5q and the altered expression of APC, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin proteins in UC-related cancers indicate a critical role of the APC/beta-catenin pathway in UC-related carcinogenesis.","title":"[Molecular carcinogenesis in ulcerative colitis-associated and sporadic colorectal carcinoma--differences and similarities].","pubmedId":"10714203"}
