Elevated FLT3 ligand levels (FL) secondary to cytotoxic chemotherapy is a putative mechanism of resistance to the FLT3 kinase inhibitors. We hypothesized that FL levels will be lower when combining sorafenib with less intensive therapy such as 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza). This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of sorafenib and 5-Aza in patients with refractory or relapsed AML with FLT3-ITD mutation.  Methods:    Patients were eligible if they had relapsed or refractory AML and were 18 years of age or older. They received 5-Aza 75 mg/m2 IV daily x 7 days and sorafenib 400 mg PO BID continuously; cycles were repeated in approximately one month intervals.  Results:    38 patients with AML with a median age of 60 years (range, 24-87) were enrolled. 4 were inevaluable as they never received therapy or discontinued it before response assessment.  FLT-3-ITD was detected in 30 (88%) patients. They had received a median of 2 prior treatments (range, 0-6); 13 (38%) had received  3 prior regimens and 8 had failed prior FLT3 kinase inhibitor. Response rate was 41%, including 6 (17%) with CRi, 4 (12) with CRp, 3 (9%) with CR, and 1(3%) PR. The median time to achieving CR/CRi was 2 cycles (Range, 1-6) and the median duration of CR/CRi was 3 months (Range, 112).  Conclusions:   Combination of 5-Aza and sorafenib is effective for patients with relapsed AML with FLT-3-ITD mutation.","title":"Response rates in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia with FLT3-ITD mutation using 5-azacitadine plus sorafenib.","pubmedId":"ASCO_103555-127"}
