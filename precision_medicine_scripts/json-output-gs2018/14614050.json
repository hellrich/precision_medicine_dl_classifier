Therefore, we analyzed samples of human soft tissue sarcomas to determine the status of the chromosomal region 12q14-15, which contains the MDM2 gene encoding the well-known counterpart of the tumor suppressor p53. In addition, we determined whether an amplified MDM2 gene was present in the samples. Of the 88 soft tissue sarcoma samples, 24 (27%) showed evidence of loss of heterozygosity of markers representing 12q14-15, and 12 (14%) showed evidence of microsatellite instability. Of the 72 samples analyzed by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction, 15 (21%) possessed an amplified MDM2 gene. Loss of heterozygosity (P \u003d.008) and microsatellite instability (P \u003d.035) were significantly more common in Stage I tumors than in higher stage tumors. This result indicated that these alterations occur early in soft tissue sarcoma progression and possibly define a subgroup of soft tissue sarcoma. Surprisingly, MDM2 amplification in soft tissue sarcoma patients was associated with a prognosis better than that of patients without the amplification; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P \u003d.6). Furthermore, of the tumors with an MDM2 amplification, 40% (6/15) also experienced loss of heterozygosity at 12q14-15; in contrast, only 16% of tumors without an MDM2 amplification (9/57) underwent a loss of heterozygosity. A concomitant occurrence of deletions and amplifications resulting from deficiencies in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway could in part explain this finding.","title":"Loss of heterozygosity at 12q14-15 often occurs in stage I soft tissue sarcomas and is associated with MDM2 amplification in tumors at various stages.","pubmedId":"14614050"}
