Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to estimate the association strength.\nA total of 14 eligible studies with 2828 patients were identified according to our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis results showed that carriers of the variant 241Met allele were significantly associated with good response, compared with those harboring the wild 241Thr allele (Met vs. Thr, OR \u003d 1.453, 95% CI: 1.116-1.892, Pheterogeneity \u003d 0.968 and ThrMet+MetMet vs. ThrThr, OR \u003d 1.476, 95% CI: 1.087-2.004, Pheterogeneity \u003d 0.696). This significant association was observed in Caucasian population but not in Asian population. On the other hand, there was no significant association of XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism with survival (ThrMet+MetMet vs. ThrThr, HR \u003d 1.082, 95% CI: 0.929-1.261, Pheterogeneity \u003d 0.564), and there was no difference between Asian and Caucasian population.\nThese findings suggest a predictive role of XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism on response to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Additionally, we first report that the XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism is associated with response to platinum-based chemotherapy and highlights the prognostic value of the XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism.","title":"XRCC3 Thr241Met is associated with response to platinum-based chemotherapy but not survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24116196"}
