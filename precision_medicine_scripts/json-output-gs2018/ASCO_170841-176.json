However its role in improving radiosensitivity and improving functional imaging has not been evaluated. The main goal of this study was evaluate the role of molecular profiling as a method to target gold nanoparticles (GNP) in order to enhance radiosensitivity in treatment of Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC). A second goal was to evaluate the effect of targeted GNP on imaging of metastatic ACC. Methods: 16 nude mice were implanted with parotid ACC found to have an Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (Alk) receptor mutation .The mice were treated with radiation, Crizotinib, GNP and radiation , and GNP conjugated to Crizotinib with radiation, alone or in various combinations,The mice were followed for four weeks. Results: We demonstrated that Alk targeted GNP enhanced the radiation effect and had a significant impact on tumor growth (P \u003c 0.01) relative to radiation alone . Additionally, we demonstrated that targeted GNP had a significant effect on tumor visualization and imaging enhancement. Four weeks post injection, an ex vivo analysis using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy was conducted,The amount of GNP in the tumor after 4 weeks in the group that was irradiated with targeted GNP was twice as high as in the non targeted group. The GNP was proven to be safe as no evidence of toxicity has been observed. Conclusions: Molecular profiling can serve as a method to enhance radio- sensitivity and improve imaging in salivary gland ACC.","title":"The impact of molecular profiling guided targeted gold nanoparticles on radiosensitivity of metastatic salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_170841-176"}
