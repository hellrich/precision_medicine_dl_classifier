Recent reports indicate that encapsulated FVPTC behaves like follicular adenomas, while infiltrative FVPTC behaves like cPTC. This raises the possibility that histology and/or mutation status might help personalize management of FVPTC regarding extent of surgery, intensity of follow-up, and targeted therapy. This study correlates histological features, immunoreactivity for CK19, HBME, and Gal, and BRAF V600E mutation with lymph node (LN) metastasis and follow-up in FVPTC.\nForty-eight FVPTC (21 with regional lymph node metastasis [LN+] and 27 with negative lymph nodes [LN-]) were reviewed. Demographics, tumor focality, size, circumscription, follicular architecture, lymphovascular invasion, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), and margin status were charted. Macrodissected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from 47 (21 LN+ and 26 LN-) cases were analyzed for BRAF V600E (1799T\u003eA) mutation using real-time PCR. Correlations between the variables and LN status were calculated.\nSixty-two percent of cases with ETE demonstrated LN metastasis, while 59 % of cases with circumscribed tumors were LN-. In multivariable analysis, ETE and tumor size ≥1 cm were the best predictors of LN+ status, whereas in cases without ETE, the infiltrative pattern and tumor size provided the \"best fit.\" Immunostains and BRAF mutation status were not helpful. All four tumors that recurred were LN+, with infiltrative borders, and lacked the BRAF mutation.\nTumor circumscription, extrathyroidal extension, and tumor size ≥ 1.0 cm are predictors of lymph node status in FVPTC.","title":"Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC): histological features, BRAF V600E mutation, and lymph node status.","pubmedId":"25702102"}
