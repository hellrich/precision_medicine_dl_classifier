We now investigated whether human melanoma survival in response to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is modulated by: (a) stable introduction of a DN-mutant p53; (b) pharmacologically inhibiting ERK activation with UO126; (c) addition of exogenous SOD. Nitroprusside releases nitric oxide (NO) when intact, or acts in a NO-independent manner via iron and residual cyanide after light exposure (lex-SNP). When tested at 300 microM in 72 h treatments by cytometric live-dead assays, intact SNP caused a 50% lethality versus a 30% lethality induced by lex-SNP. No protection from SNP toxicity was seen when inhibiting the PI3-kinase pathway with LY294002 or c-Jun NH(2) kinase signaling with SP600125. However, pretreatment with UO126 protected from SNP-mediated cell death including counteracting apoptosis-associated Bax expression and PARP cleavage, plus reversing loss of Cu,Zn-SOD. Moreover, addition of exogenous SOD also protected cells from SNP toxicity. In spite of the greater earlier effects of intact SNP, cells treated with single doses of either intact or lex-SNP, revealed about a 90% mortality in longer 120 h treatments, and these were also counteracted by UO126 or exogenous SOD. This report is the first to show that: constitutive ERK activation characteristic of cancer cells, increases a nitroprusside-induced apoptosis modulated by SOD.","title":"ERK activation increases nitroprusside induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells irrespective of p53 status: role of superoxide dismutases.","pubmedId":"19395858"}
