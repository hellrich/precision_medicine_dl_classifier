CXCR4 has been implicated in the invasion of metastasis of multiple tumor types that metastasize to bone, including prostate carcinoma and breast carcinoma. However, in neuroblastoma, a pediatric tumor that frequently metastasizes to bone and causes osteolytic lesions, the role of CXCR4 has not been elucidated. Several studies have suggested multiple potential roles of CXCR4 activation and signaling in neuroblastoma progression, including proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our previous studies have shown that blocking the CXCR4 receptor using a neutralizing antibody reduces migration toward the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12. However, when CXCL12 is added to neuroblastoma cells, activating the receptor, rather than an increase in migration, neurite extension and differentiation occurs. Through subsequent studies, we have demonstrated that upon stimulation, CXCR4 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, potentially through the adaptor protein drebrin. Furthermore, this interaction appears to be dependent upon Akt. Our current hypothesis is that at low levels of CXCL12, migration is induced; upon increased activation of the receptor, however, CXCR4 is internalized, reducing the amount of receptor on the cell surface, and the internalized receptor then interacts with actin to increase process extension. This enables the neuroblastoma cells to migrate toward favorable conditions, but once the cells have reached those conditions (such as high CXCL12 levels in bone), the cells to remain in that environment. Experiments are currently being performed to test this working hypothesis.","title":"CXCR4 regulation of neuroblastoma migration and differentiation.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-4098"}
