TDP-43 (TARDBP), a DNA and RNA binding protein, is well known to play a key role in RNA processing, including involving in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Recent reports suggested that TDP-43 may participate to the regulation of metabolic glycolysis in cancer. Overcoming metabolic stress is critical for cancer cell survival and growth in nutrient deprivation condition. Herein we found TDP-43 overexpression promotes glioblastoma cell survival and suppressed the activated-form levels of caspase 3 protein under nutrient deprivation. Overexpression of TDP-43 increased the tumorigenicity as determined by anchorage-independent growth assay and xenografts in immunocompromised mice model. Under nutrient deprivation, we also found that TDP-43-overexpression induced autophagy. By this study, we presume TDP-43 enhanced GBM cells tumorigincity, activated autophagy and inhibited cell death under nutrient deprivation condition. TDP-43 is potentially the new aspects for understanding the tumorigenicity and metablolic regulation for malignant brain tumors and GBM.","title":"TDP-43 promotes glioblalstoma cell survival under nutrient deprivation condition via activating autophagy","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-325"}
