The major growth-promoting factor for MTLn3 cells from porcine and rat lung-conditioned media was isolated by using a five-step procedure (anion exchange chromatography, Affi-gel blue affinity chromatography, chromatofocusing, size exclusion chromatography, and preparative native gel electrophoresis). The lung-derived factor that stimulated the growth of highly metastatic MTLn3 cells was a glycoprotein of Mr approximately 66,000 (non-reduced) or Mr approximately 72,000 (reduced) and possessed a pI of 6.9-7.0. It preferentially promoted the growth of lung-metastasizing tumor lines over their poorly lung-metastasizing counterparts in three tumor systems: rat 13762NF mammary adenocarcinoma, murine B16 melanoma, and murine RAW117 large-cell lymphoma. The factor\u0027s growth-stimulatory affect was inactivated by reduction or exposure to high temperature (95 degrees C). Although the growth factor appears to be glycosylated, its molecular weight was not altered by treatment with the protein-deglycosylating agent, trifluoromethane sulfonic acid. Cleavage of the protein by cyanogen bromide resulted in the formation of five fragments. Malignant cell response to this lung-derived paracrine growth factor may be important in the successful formation of lung metastases.","title":"Purification and characterization of a Mr approximately 66,000 lung-derived (paracrine) growth factor that preferentially stimulates the in vitro proliferation of lung-metastasizing tumor cells.","pubmedId":"2166061"}
