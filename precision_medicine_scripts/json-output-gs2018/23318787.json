One highly anticipated use of novel therapeutic agents is in the adjuvant setting. Adjuvant BRAF and/or immune checkpoint inhibition may positively affect the survival of melanoma patients diagnosed at earlier stages but still at high risk for postsurgical relapses. BRAF V600 mutations and, potentially, melanoma-associated immunity are predictive biomarkers for responses to these novel therapies. Emerging evidence points to these predictive biomarkers doubling as prognostic biomarkers for high-risk stage III patients, promising to help stratify these patients for the application of novel adjuvant therapies.","title":"Melanoma prognostics and personalized therapeutics at a crossroad.","pubmedId":"23318787"}
