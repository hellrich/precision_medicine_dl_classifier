Most are resectable, but not all are neoplastic. This review provides an update on the histopathology, immunohistochemistry, molecular biology, pathogenesis and management of cystic neoplasms of the exocrine pancreas. These include the serous, the mucinous cystic, the intraductal papillary mucinous and the solid pseudopapillary neoplasms. Recently reported variants are described and very rare cystic variants of other pancreatic epithelial and mesenchymal neoplasms are briefly mentioned.","title":"Cystic neoplasms of the exocrine pancreas.","pubmedId":"17903202"}
