The influence, exerted by exogenous IGF-I on the expression of these genes, was also investigated.\nThyroid tissue specimens were obtained from 65 patients during subtotal or total thyroidectomies. After approximately 2-3 weeks of culture, thyroid cells were incubated for 24 hours with IGF-I in concentrations of: 0, 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml. The total mRNA was isolated according to the method described by Chomczy≈Ñski and Sacchi with our own modifications. Afterwards, mRNA encoding IGF-I, IGFBP-1-IGFBP-4 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), were amplified, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); GAPDH gene served as a control gene. PCR products were electrophoresed and then submitted to densitometric analysis.\nOur study has shown that in carcinoma cells (ATC, PTC, MTC), IGF-I reveals a stimulatory influence on the expression of its own gene, that effect being most distinctive in ATC cells. These facts indicate an important role of IGF-I in the pathogenesis and invasiveness of the analyzed malignant neoplasms.","title":"Expression of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) gene and of genes for IGF-binding proteins 1, 2, 3, 4 (IGFBP-1-IGFBP-4) in non-neoplastic human thyroid cells and in certain human thyroid cancers.
