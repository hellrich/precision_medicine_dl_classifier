In this study, we examined its possible modes of action for antileukemic effects on FLT3-activated, FLT3 wild-type, or imatinib-resistant leukemia cells. KW-2449 showed the potent growth inhibitory effects on leukemia cells with FLT3 mutations by inhibition of the FLT3 kinase, resulting in the down-regulation of phosphorylated-FLT3/STAT5, G(1) arrest, and apoptosis. Oral administration of KW-2449 showed dose-dependent and significant tumor growth inhibition in FLT3-mutated xenograft model with minimum bone marrow suppression. In FLT3 wild-type human leukemia, it induced the reduction of phosphorylated histone H3, G(2)/M arrest, and apoptosis. In imatinib-resistant leukemia, KW-2449 contributed to release of the resistance by the simultaneous down-regulation of BCR/ABL and Aurora kinases. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of KW-2449 was confirmed in primary samples from AML and imatinib-resistant patients. The inhibitory activity of KW-2449 is not affected by the presence of human plasma protein, such as alpha1-acid glycoprotein. These results indicate KW-2449 has potent growth inhibitory activity against various types of leukemia by several mechanisms of action. Our studies indicate KW-2449 has significant activity and warrants clinical study in leukemia patients with FLT3 mutations as well as imatinib-resistant mutations.","title":"KW-2449, a novel multikinase inhibitor, suppresses the growth of leukemia cells with FLT3 mutations or T315I-mutated BCR/ABL translocation.","pubmedId":"19541823"}
