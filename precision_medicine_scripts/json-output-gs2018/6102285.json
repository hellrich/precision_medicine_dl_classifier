Sex differences in the course of the disease in this subset were studied. Intervals between subsequent stages of melanoma activity were longer, but not significantly so, in female than male patients. Survival times from initial distant metastasis were significantly longer in women than in men. Tumour doubling time of pulmonary secondaries revealed a clear tendency to a slower growth rate in female patients. Our analysis suggests that malignant melanoma might be an androgen-dependent tumour. Therapy with anti-androgens or orchidectomy deserves consideration in male patients with metastatic melanoma.","title":"Malignant melanoma: an androgen-dependent tumour?","pubmedId":"6102285"}
