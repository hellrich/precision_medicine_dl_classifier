He had a history of lung squamous cell carcinoma for which he underwent right lung lobectomy 3 years earlier. Preliminary blood tests showed leucocytosis with marked eosinophilia. No evidence of recurrent malignancy was detected, but computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed an enlarged and edematous pancreas with hyperemia and infiltration of the peripancreatic fat. Fine needle aspiration from the lesion revealed inflammatory infiltration predominantly composed of eosinophils. The diagnosis of eosinophilic pancreatitis was suggested and the patient was placed on prednisone, but without any clinical or laboratory improvement. Two months later, the patient developed severe dyspnea, chylothorax, and acute renal failure. Cytologic studies of the pleural fluid revealed malignant cells from recurrent lung squamous cell carcinoma. The disease course was characterized by rapid deterioration and a fatal outcome. To the authors\u0027 knowledge, eosinophilic pancreatic infiltration as a manifestation of lung carcinoma has not been previously reported.","title":"Eosinophilic pancreatic infiltration as a manifestation of lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16702798"}
