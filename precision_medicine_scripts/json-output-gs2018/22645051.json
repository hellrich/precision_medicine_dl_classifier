Each assay could detect a single mutated molecule per reaction, whereas 10(4) copies of normal DNA were not detected. The ctDNA was readily detected in plasma of mice bearing uveal melanoma xenografts in amounts proportional to circulating human DNA. Finally, plasma was almost always found positive (20 of 21 tested patients) in a prospective analysis of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.\nBi-PAP assays detect and quantify ctDNA in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. A prospective study is ongoing to assess the clinical usefulness of ctDNA level in uveal melanoma.","title":"Pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization detects circulating tumor DNA in metastatic uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"22645051"}
