While DEK was initially described as a protein binding to certain topological chromatin structures, recent studies implicate DEK in the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of specific genes. To assess the global gene binding of DEK, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). We demonstrate that DEK does not bind evenly throughout the genome, but rather accumulates around transcription start sites, with binding to promoters and initial parts of the coding sequences. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that DEK preferentially binds genes associated with epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Our results represent the first genome-wide characterization of DEK binding, and further establish DEK as a transcriptional regulator with a specific set of target genes.","title":"Genome-wide mapping of binding sites for the DEK oncoprotein by ChIP-seq.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-762"}
