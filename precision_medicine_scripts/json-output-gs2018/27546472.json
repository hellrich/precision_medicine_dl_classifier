Although proximal femur morphology is known to vary with both age and gender, few studies investigated this in the very elderly (ie, ≥80 years). The purpose of this study was to compare basic morphological parameters describing the position of the femoral head between very elderly and middle-aged subjects.\nComputed tomographic scans of the femur of 90 very elderly (mean 84 years, range 80-105 years) and 58 middle-aged subjects (mean 52 years, range 20-79 years) were made. After 3-dimensional reconstruction, the neck-shaft angle, femoral neck anteversion angle, femoral head height, femoral neck length, and mediolateral offset (ML-offset) were determined.\nThe neck-shaft angle was on average 3.6° less in elderly males (125.9° ± 5.0°) than in middle-aged males (129.5° ± 5.1°) (P \u003c .001). The femoral neck anteversion angle was not significantly different between both age and gender groups. The femoral head height was -12.3 mm in elderly females compared to -10.5 mm (Δ 17%) in elderly males (P \u003d .284) and even -8.0 mm (Δ 54%) in middle-aged males. The ML-offset was 10% (4.1 mm) larger in elderly compared to middle-aged males (P \u003c .001).\nThese findings suggest that the femoral neck and head shift in a relative varus position during aging. Femoral prostheses with increased ML-offset and a lower caput-collum-diaphyseal angle are needed to accommodate the morphology of the femur in the very elderly. Care must be taken not to lengthen the operated leg, particularly in very elderly females.","title":"The Femoral Head Center Shifts in a Mediocaudal Direction During Aging.","pubmedId":"27546472"}
