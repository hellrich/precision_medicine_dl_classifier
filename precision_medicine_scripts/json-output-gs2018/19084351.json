These patients were free of biochemical failure (American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology [ASTRO] definition) during the first 5 post-treatment years and had a documented 5-year prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value. The median follow-up was 6.93 years.\nThe actuarial 10-year freedom from PSA failure rate was 97% using the ASTRO definition and 95% using the Phoenix definition. The median 5-year PSA level was 0.03 ng/mL (range, 0-3.6). The 5-year PSA value was \u003cor\u003d0.01 in 47.7%, \u003e0.01-0.10 in 31.1%, \u003e0.10-0.2 in 10.2%, \u003e0.2-0.5 in 7.82%, and \u003e0.5 in 3.10%. The 5-year PSA value had prognostic significance, with a PSA value of \u003cor\u003d0.2 ng/mL (n \u003d 661) corresponding to a 10-year freedom from PSA failure rate of 99% with the ASTRO definition and 98% with the Phoenix definition vs. 86% (ASTRO definition) and 81% (Phoenix definition) for a PSA value \u003eor\u003d0.2 ng/mL (n \u003d 81; p \u003c .0001). The treatment regimen had no effect on biochemical failure. None of the 742 patients in this study developed metastatic disease or died of prostate cancer.\nThe results of this study have shown that the prognosis for patients treated with brachytherapy and who remain biochemically free of disease for \u003eor\u003d5 years is excellent and none developed metastatic disease during the first 10 years after treatment. The 5-year PSA value is prognostic, and patients with a PSA value \u003c0.2 ng/mL are unlikely to develop subsequent biochemical relapse.","title":"Prognostic significance of 5-year PSA value for predicting prostate cancer recurrence after brachytherapy alone and combined with hormonal therapy and/or external beam radiotherapy.","pubmedId":"19084351"}
