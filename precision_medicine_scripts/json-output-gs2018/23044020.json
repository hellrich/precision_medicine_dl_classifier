Acute cranial nerve findings on neurologic examination can be indications for brain imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging can highlight cranial nerves emerging from the brainstem, particularly if they are gadolinium-enhanced or thickened. We describe a 15-month-old girl with acute unilateral ophthalmoplegia as the presenting sign of acute myeloid leukemia. Her presentation emphasizes the importance of appropriate laboratory and radiographic evaluation in a toddler with new-onset strabismus, which may be discounted as a previously unrecognized or benign finding.","title":"Acute unilateral ophthalmoplegia as the presenting sign of acute myeloid leukemia in a 15-month-old girl.","pubmedId":"23044020"}
