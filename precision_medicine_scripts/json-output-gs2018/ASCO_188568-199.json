We reported the comprehensive analyses of potential predictive biomarkers for PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors based on Chinese patients exome profiling data. Methods: Over 1,000 cancer patients from 70 hospitals across 20 provinces in China were recruited and the whole exome of tumor/normal samples of each patient were sequenced. Four potential genomic biomarkers: tumor mutation burden (TMB), mismatch repair deficiency (MMR), microsatellite instability (MSI), and PD-L1 (CD274) amplification (PD-L1 AMP) were analyzed in this Chinese cohort and compared with the mainly Caucasian cohort in TCGA database. Results: At least one of the four preselected genomic biomarkers was identified in 40.8% of this Chinese cancer patient cohort by clinical whole exome sequencing (CWES) analysis. Similar to TCGA cohort, the top 3 high TMB tumor types are lung, esophagus and colorectal cancer. Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients showed higher TMB than the TCGA cohort (Median: 106 vs. 65 non-synonymous mutations per tumor NMT), which might be due to different etiologies. Five late stage cancer patients (3 lung, 1 melanoma and 1 gallbladder) using PD1/PD-L1 blockade with high TMB showed durable clinical benefit (SD6months/PR/CR). Comparing with TCGA data, Chinese colorectal cancer cohort (252 patients) had relative lower MSI-high or MMR related mutations (8.33% vs. 12.5%, and 3.97% vs. 10.0% respectively). PD-L1 AMP most frequently occurred in lung squamous (14.3% VS 9.8% TCGA), HER2-positive breast cancer (8.8% VS 6.8% TCGA with unknown HER2 status) and sarcoma (6.0% VS 9.4%TCGA). One Chinese renal cell carcinoma patient with PD-L1 AMP received anti-PD-1 treatment and on-going PFS is 7 months by far. Conclusions: Our CWES analysis and limited clinical follow-up observations suggested that about 40% Chinese cancer patients had at least one of the 4 potential immunotherapy predictive biomarker mutations. Long-term follow-up is needed to verify the validity of those markers.","title":"Comprehensive analysis of potential immunotherapy genomic biomarkers by profiling paired tumor/normal exome of 1,000 Chinese cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_188568-199"}
