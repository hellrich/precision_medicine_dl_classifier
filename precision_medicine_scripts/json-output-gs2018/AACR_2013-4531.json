Thus far, bead-based aAPC have been synthesized by coupling T cell activating proteins such as CD3 or MHC-peptide to beads several microns in diameter. By reducing the size of aAPC, we anticipated more efficient delivery of these stimulatory signals to tumor and lymph nodes where antigen-specific T cells reside. We thus manufactured aAPC based on two nanoscale particle platforms: biocompatible iron-dextran paramagnetic particles, 50-100 nm in diameter, and avidin-coated quantum dot nanocrystals, less than 20 nm in diameter. Nanoscale aAPC induced antigen-specific T cell proliferation from both TCR transgenic mouse splenocytes and human, polyclonal peripheral blood T cells. In a subcutaneous mouse melanoma model, both iron-dextran particles and quantum dot nanocrystals mediated tumor rejection when injected in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a nanoscale, particle-based aAPC that induces T cell proliferation in vitro and leads to effective T cell stimulation and tumor rejection in vivo. Furthermore, nano-aAPC represent a novel platform for studying receptor-ligand interactions at the membrane-nanoparticle interface.","title":"Nanoscale Artificial Antigen Presenting Cells for T Cell Immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-4531"}
