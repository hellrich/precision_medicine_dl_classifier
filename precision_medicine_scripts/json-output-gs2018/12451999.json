Percentage of p53 staining in the groups with negative lymph nodes and positive ones were 6.67% and 41.67%, respectively (P \u003d 0.01). While c-erbB2 expression was not associated with lymph node status.\nThe p53 overexpression was an important factor in the process of carcinogenesis of elder women with cervical cancer and a predictive indicator for lymph node status. c-erbB2 gene may be activated in the early stage of pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma in geriatric patients.","title":"[Expression and clinical significance of p53 and c-erbB2 in geriatric women with cervical carcinoma].","pubmedId":"12451999"}
