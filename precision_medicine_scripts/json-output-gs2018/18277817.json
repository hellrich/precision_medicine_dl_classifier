Hematogenous spread may affect the lung, bone and brain. We present a case of hematogenous metastases of papillary thyroid carcinoma both in the choroid and the skin, which are reported in the literature to be rare sites of metastases in primary differentiated thyroid carcinoma. This finding is even more remarkable, as the reported patient presented without any other disseminated hematogenous metastases at the time of diagnosis of both of these metastases. With this background, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid should be considered in the differential diagnosis of choroidal or skin metastasis of unknown origin.","title":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma with an uncommon spread of hematogenous metastases to the choroid and the skin.","pubmedId":"18277817"}
