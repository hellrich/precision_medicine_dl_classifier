An increase in insulin release was observed when microencapsulated islets were stimulated by glucose+theophylline, and when microencapsulated RINm5F cells were stimulated by arginine+theophylline. These findings demonstrate the permeability of the microcapsule membrane to these B-cell secretagogues and to insulin. Immunoisolation of RINm5F cells by microencapsulation was assessed using a 51chromium cytotoxicity test. Significant 51Cr release was observed when nonencapsulated cells were incubated with complement and either the serum of a rabbit immunized with RIN cells or the sera of two patients with recently diagnosed Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes. This effect was not observed with encapsulated cells. Both free and encapsulated cells released 80% of their initial radioactivity when incubated in the presence of HC1. These results clearly demonstrate pancreatic cell immunoisolation by microencapsulation. They also provide a method for the in vitro evaluation of the functional characteristics of microcapsules, in terms of both insulin permeability and immunoprotection.","title":"Immunoisolation of pancreatic B cells by microencapsulation.
