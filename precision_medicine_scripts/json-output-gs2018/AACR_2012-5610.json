These tumors are sensitive to ADI-PEG20 because they do not express argininosuccinate synthetase (AS), the rate-limiting enzyme for the de novo biosynthesis of Arg, and therefore require Arg from extracellular source for survival. ADI-PEG20 treatment, which catalyzes the conversion of Arg into citrulline and ammonia, results in Arg deprivation. Melanoma cells develop ADI-resistance because of induced AS upregulation. We previously demonstrated that induction of AS expression by ADI-PEG20 involves upregulation of transcription regulator c-Myc that positively regulates AS expression, but the underlying mechanism of c-Myc induction is not known. Here, we show that ADI-PEG20 activates Ras signaling and its downstream ERK and PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 kinase cascades. These cascades phosphorylate c-Myc, resulting in c-Myc stabilization by attenuating the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrated that intervention of these signaling pathway using PI3K/Akt inhibitors suppressed c-Myc induction and enhance ADI-mediated cell killing. Because the Ras activation signaling is known to play important roles in tumor growth, our findings have important implications in Arg-deprivation and cancer cell metabolism and suggest that targeting the Ras signaling pathway may be beneficial in ADI-PEG20 anti-cancer therapy.","title":"Activation of Ras/PI3K/ERK pathway induces c-Myc stabilization to upregulate argininosuccinate synthetase, leading to arginine deiminase resistance in melanoma cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5610"}
