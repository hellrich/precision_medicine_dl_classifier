This complexity is increased among male patients, because male patients tend to have relatively nonspecific complaints, are typically more demanding, and are regarded as being much less attentive during consultations. It is critical for the surgeon to verify that the male patient has realistic goals before he undergoes an operation, and the surgeon must confirm that the male patient has heard and understood all of the risks, benefits, and options. It is essential that masculine features be preserved for male rhinoplasty patients. Excessive dorsal reduction or tip refinement produces unsatisfactory results. A comprehensive discussion of proper evaluation of the male nose, surgical planning, intraoperative techniques, and postoperative treatment is presented. These tools should allow plastic surgeons to produce a balanced harmonious nose in relation to the rest of the face.","title":"Male rhinoplasty.","pubmedId":"12973227"}
