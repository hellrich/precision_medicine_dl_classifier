LDH serum levels were elevated at diagnosis and normal after therapy in all the patients; remained low in two patients in remission, increased in one at the moment of progression. LDH isoenzymes appeared to be of limited clinical use.","title":"LDH and LDH isoenzymes in ovarian dysgerminoma.","pubmedId":"7664770"}
