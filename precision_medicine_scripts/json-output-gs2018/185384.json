Serum enzymes, including creatine phosphokinase (CPK), aldolase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), decreased initially during high dose systemic corticosteroid therapy, although profound muscle weakness persisted. Subsequent elevation of serum LDH and SGOT levels during treatment provided a clue to underlying neoplasia. Primary hepatoma with widespread metastases was found at necropsy.","title":"Aberrant serum enzyme patterns in dermatomyositis associated with hepatoma.","pubmedId":"185384"}
