Multivariate analysis was performed with the use of a logistic regression model.\nThe most common site for head and neck SCC was the oral cavity (42%), with 17% of patients having tumors of unknown primary site. The disease-free survival probability was 76.7% at five years. Patients who were older at neck dissection, were nonsmokers, or who did not have radiotherapy to the primary site were more likely to die with head and neck cancer or to have local regional recurrence (P \u003c 0.1). Patients with more radical neck dissections did not have better survival or recurrence outcomes. Lymphatic invasion appears to be the only important factor in predicting local regional recurrence alone (P \u003d 0.1), of which 67% occurred within the first postoperative year.\nPatients with smoking-related SCC are likely to have a less aggressive disease. Adjuvant radiotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of patients with head and neck SCC. Follow-up, especially within the first postoperative year, is essential in managing head and neck SCC. Head and neck surgeons can confidently continue their practice away from more radical neck dissections.","title":"Neck dissection for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"17398340"}
