However, few studies directly focus on the relationship between EGFR-TKI\u0027s efficacy and smoking history in NSCLC EGFR-mutant patients.\nElectronic databases were searched for eligible literatures. Data on objective response rates, disease control rates, and progression-free survival (PFS) stratified by smoking status were extracted and synthesized on the basis of a random-effect model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted.\nA total of 9 studies that involved a total of 1029 EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patients after EGFR-TKI treatment were included. In overall, nonsmoking was associated with significant prolonged PFS (HR, 0.73, 0.60 to 0.88; P \u003d .001) compared to ever smokers. However, only marginal improvements without statistical significance in objective response rates (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.46; P \u003d .433) and disease control rate (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.33; P \u003d .740) were observed. Subgroup analyses showed that the benefits of PFS in nonsmokers were predominantly presented in pooled results of studies enrolling patients with active EGFR mutations, studies involving previously treated patients, and retrospective studies. Additionally, we failed to observe any significant benefit from nonsmokers in every subgroup for objective response rates and disease control rate.\nFor advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, nonsmoking is associated with longer PFS than ever smoking after EGFR-TKIs treatment. Smoking history should be considered an essential factor in studies regarding EGFR-targeted agents toward EGFR-mutant patients.","title":"Impact of smoking status on EGFR-TKI efficacy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in EGFR mutants: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"25454007"}
