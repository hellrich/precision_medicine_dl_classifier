FLT3 mutation is the most frequent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and involved in the signaling pathway of autonomous proliferation and differentiation block in leukemia cells. Since FLT3 mutation is strongly associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis, it is expected that development of FLT3 kinase inhibitors will make more efficacious therapeutic strategy for leukemia therapy. Although many FLT3 inhibitors have been subjected to clinical trials, their clinical efficacies for AML seem unimpressive, and several problems regarding adverse effects and resistant mechanism are apparent. Here, I would like to summarize recent advances of FLT3 inhibitors in development.","title":"[FLT3 inhibitors for acute myeloid leukemia].","pubmedId":"25016800"}
