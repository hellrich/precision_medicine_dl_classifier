The aim of the present study was to report the prevalence of FLT3 mutations and comparison with prognostic factors in AML patients in the Northeastern of Iran.\nThis cross-sectional study concerned 100 AML cases diagnosed based on bone marrow aspiration and peripheral blood. DNA for every AML patient was extracted and underwent PCR with FLT3-ITD primers.\nThe mean age at diagnosis was 28.5 years (range, 1-66 years), 52 patients (52%) being male. Out of 100 AML patients, 21 (21%) had FLT3 mutation, (17 with FLT3- ITD, 81%, and 4 with FLT3-D825, 19%). Of the 21, 14 (66.7%) had heterozygous mutation. There was no significant difference between age, sex and organomegaly between patients with FLT3 mutation versus FLT3 wild-type.\nOur frequency of FLT3 is in line with earlier fidnings of approximately 20 to 30% and also the prevalence of FLT3-ITD is more than FLT3-D35 mutation. There was no significant difference between prognostic factors (age and sex) in the patients with FLT3 mutation versus FLT3 wild-type. The prevalence of FLT3 heterozygous mutations is more that homozygous mutations in AML patients.","title":"Frequency of FLT3 (ITD, D835) Gene Mutations in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia: a Report from Northeastern Iran.","pubmedId":"27797237"}
