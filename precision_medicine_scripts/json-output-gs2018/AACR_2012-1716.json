FGFR receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway has been implicated in tumor cell growth, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Activation of the FGFR pathway via FGFR over-expression, and chromosomal amplification and translocation as well as genetic mutation contributes to the tumor progression and the resistance to anti-EGFR and -VEGF treatment in lung cancer. Targeting FGFR pathway is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy for lung cancer. We have discovered and developed a novel, ATP competitive and orally active small molecule inhibitor of FGFR, LY2874455, currently in clinic development. LY2874455 is a potent inhibitor against four FGFRs, and demonstrates a broad-spectrum of anti-tumor activity in a number of tumor xenograft models. In the current study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of LY2874455 in lung tumor cells with or without FGFR1 gene amplification. FGFR1 is known to be amplified in human lung cancer cells NCI-H1581, NCI-H520 and DMS-114, but not in NCI-H460, A549 and NCI-H1299. The mRNA expression levels of FGFR1 are shown to be higher in the FGFR1 amplified cells than those in the FGFR1 non-amplified cells. Consistent with this, the FGFR1 amplified cells exhibited the much more robust b-FGF-induced phosphorylation of FRS2 and ERK, which are also more sensitive to the inhibition by LY2874455 than that in the FGFR1 non-amplified cells. Furthermore, the FGFR1 amplified cells exhibit the better responses to the growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by LY2874455 than those in the FGFR1 non-amplified cells. Therefore, these findings suggest that FGFR1 plays an important role in lung cancer cell growth and survival, and that LY2874455 may provide a promising treatment option for some lung cancer patients whose tumor harbors FGFR1 gene amplification. The in vivo anti-tumor response of LY2874455 is being further investigated in the tumor xenograft models derived from these FGFR1 amplified or non-amplified human lung cancer cells.","title":"FGFR1 gene amplification predicts the antitumor response of FGFR inhibitor LY2874455 in human lung cancer cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1716"}
