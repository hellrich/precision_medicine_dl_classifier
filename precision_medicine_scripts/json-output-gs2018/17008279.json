Since PEComas are tumours having both a spindle cell component and an epithelioid and giant cell component, as seen in many sarcomas, as well as having a wide distribution in various organs and soft tissue, we reviewed cases originally diagnosed as sarcomas of the soft tissue in our institution and screened them by immunostaining for HMB45.\nConsecutive soft tissue sarcomas (31 tumours) retrieved from the Surgical Pathology file at our institution for a period of 3 years were submitted for immunostaining for HMB45. Cases with positive HMB45 immunostaining were submitted for further immunostaining for MART1, CD68, S100 protein, cytokeratin AE1/3, EMA, vimentin, MSA and CD117.\nOf 31 sarcomas, three tumours in the group of 11 malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH) and unclassified sarcomas showed positive immunoreactivity for HMB45 and MART1 in 1-25% of tumour cells. The three tumours were located in the lower extremities and measured 8, 11 and 12 cm in diameter. Patient gender male:female was 2:1 and ages were 46, 56 and 60 years. Microscopically, the tumours were composed of a variable proportion of spindled cells, multinucleated cells and epithelioid cells disposed in diffuse sheets or nests. Mitotic figures and necrosis were frequent. The immunoreactivity was diffuse for CD68, focal for AE3 and EMA, negative or focal for MSA and CD117, and negative for S100 and AE1. All three patients developed lymph node or distant metastases and died of the disease within 1-2 years.\nPEComa re-screened from the group of high grade sarcomas without definite differentiation range from pleomorphic to monomorphic cytohistopathological features. Immunostaining for HMB45 of unclassified sarcomas is useful for the classification of these tumours. They occur preferentially in the lower extremities and have a high malignant potential when associated with large size, tumoural necrosis and high mitotic activity.","title":"Perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa) of the soft tissue.","pubmedId":"17008279"}
