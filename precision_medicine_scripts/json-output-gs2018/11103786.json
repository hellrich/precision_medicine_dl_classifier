In 25 esophageal cases (20 by Western blot and 5 by immunohistochemistry) and 17 prostate cases (3 by Western blot and 14 by immunohistochemistry), both tumor types showed either complete loss or a dramatic reduction in the level of annexin I protein expression compared with patient-matched normal epithelium (P \u003c or \u003d 0.05). Moreover, by using Western blot analysis of laser capture microdissected, patient-matched longitudinal study sets of both tumor types, the loss of protein expression occurred in premalignant lesions. Concordance of this result with immunohistochemical analysis suggests that annexin I may be an essential component for maintenance of the normal epithelial phenotype. Additional studies investigating the mechanism(s) and functional consequences of annexin I protein loss in tumor cells are warranted.","title":"Loss of annexin 1 correlates with early onset of tumorigenesis in esophageal and prostate carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11103786"}
