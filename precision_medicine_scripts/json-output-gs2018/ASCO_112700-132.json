Here we report, for the first time, two coexisting yet mutually exclusive mechanisms of escape in a melanoma patient who presented an excellent clinical response following reintroduction of vemurafenib.  Methods:    To investigate the mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib, we performed whole-exome sequencing using the Illumina technology of a pre-treatment paraffin-embedded lymph node metastasis (Pre) and of two progressing subcutaneous snap-frozen metastases of the right arm (PV1 and PV2). The tumor samples, along with germline controls, were sequenced at high coverage (mean range 268x-356x).   Results:    We identified 107 exonic somatic Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) in Pre, 139 SNVs in PV1, and 127 SNVs in PV2, generating a set of 202 different SNVs, 82 of which were common to all 3 samples. The non-synonymous to synonymous ratios were higher for PV1 (1.82) than for PV2 (1.46), and lower for Pre (1.31). C\u003eT transitions, largely predominated in the samples, indicating light-induced damage. Two independent NRAS escape mutations (Q61K and Q61R) where observed in PV1, whereas appearance of a BRAF splice variant (lack of exon 4-10) was present in PV2. Most importantly, these 2 escape mechanisms were mutually exclusive, i.e. no BRAF splice variant was observed by PCR in PV1 and no NRAS mutation found in PV2.  Conclusions:    Our results clearly demonstrate that multiple molecular escape mechanisms can be both coexistent and mutually exclusive. These findings have clinical implications: firstly, local treatment of isolated progressing lesions and continuation of vemurafenib could be supported by the fact that the resistance mechanisms are not necessarily shared. This approach is currently being tested within clinical trials with preliminary results that seem to support this hypothesis. Secondly, the coexistence of divergent escapes within the same patient strongly argues that single biopsy analysis at progression might not reflect the molecular complexity of tumor progression, and therefore might not be sufficient to guide selection of second-line optimal combination therapy.","title":"Coexistence of multiple escape mechanisms in a BRAFV600E-mutated cutaneous melanoma treated with vemurafenib.","pubmedId":"ASCO_112700-132"}
