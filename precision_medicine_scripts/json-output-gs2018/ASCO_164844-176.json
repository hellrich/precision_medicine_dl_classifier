The main objective of our work was to compare the performance of several assays to detect mutant BRAF in plasma. Methods: A total of 54 patients with stage IIIc-IV melanoma (38 BRAF V600 mutated and 16 BRAF wild type) were tested prior to any treatment. Blood samples were collected in EDTA-containing tubes. Cell-free DNA was extracted from plasma using the QIAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid (Qiagen). We evaluated 3 technologies : 2 assays based on allele-specific PCR, the Therascreen BRAF RGQ kit (Qiagen) and the ctBRAF Mutation Detection Kit (Entrogen), and a digital PCR platform, the QuantStudio 3D system (Life Technologies). Results: Using the Therascreen assay, we were able to detect a BRAF mutation in plasma of 28/38 patients, yielding a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 73.7% when compared with tumor as the reference sample. Similar results were obtained using the Entrogen assay, with a PPA of 68.4% (26/38). The 2 most common activating mutations, V600E and V600K, had a similar PPA with both Qiagen and Entrogen tests. For all patients with wild type BRAF tumors, the research was negative on plasma DNA with both techniques (negative percent agreement, NPA \u003d 100%). The QS3D digital PCR system concluded on the presence of a BRAF mutation in only 20/34 samples (PPA \u003d 58.8%) mostly because of an insufficient number of circulating DNA copies to reach a relevant statistic value. Conclusions: The Qiagen and the Entrogen assays are based on allele-specific amplification, a technique easy to use without a specific training, unlike dPCR which requires specific equipment and training to acquire technical and interpretation skills. The unexpectedly low PPA of dPCR was attributed to the limited amount of DNA extracted from some samples. These findings suggest that the Qiagen and Entrogen plasma tests are more adapted as a screening tool for non-invasive assessment of BRAF mutation in metastatic melanoma but could be complemented with dPCR as an absolute quantification tool for follow-up.
