One case was a 67-year-old male who presented with dry cough and exertional dyspnea. He was diagnosed as IIP and transbronchial lung biopsy revealed alveolitis. BAL was performed after administration of prednisolone. He complained of severe dyspnea after BAL and was diagnosed as having an acute exacerbation of IIP. In spite of extensive treatment including pulse therapy with methylprednisolone, he died. The other case was a 57-year-old male noted to have a chest X-ray abnormality who presented with dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. He was diagnosed as having IIP and primary lung cancer. BAL was performed to evaluate the activity of IIP, and respiratory distress subsequently became severe. After BAL, he developed an acute exacerbation of IIP and died in spite of treatment. In both cases, peripheral white blood cell counts were increased just before BAL. It was suggested that this condition might participate in acute exacerbation of IIP. It should be kept in mind that some patients with IIP may develop acute exacerbation after BAL.","title":"[Two cases of IIP which developed acute exacerbation after bronchoalveolar lavage].","pubmedId":"8164406"}
