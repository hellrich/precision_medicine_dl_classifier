{"organisms":["9606","9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"A 54-year-old male with history of anemia and rheumatoid arthritis presented with a three-month history of dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema. Patient was referred for a transthoracic echocardiogram that revealed a large right atrial mass with reduced ejection fraction of 40% and an incidental large liver mass. Subsequent cardiac MRI revealed a lobulated right atrial mass measuring 5.4 cm × 5.3 cm with inferior vena cava compression and adjacent multiple large liver lesions confirmed to be malignant melanoma through biopsy. Interestingly, no primaries were found in the patient. PET/CT imaging displayed hypermetabolic masses within the right atrium and liver that likely represent metastases, as well as bilateral pleural effusions, most likely due to heart failure. Preoperative coronary angiogram demonstrated perfusion to the mass by a dense network of neovasculature arising from the mid right coronary artery. The cardiac melanoma was surgically removed, and the right atrium was reconstructed with a pericardial patch. After surgery, all cardiac chambers appeared normal in size and function with associated moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The patient is currently being administered ipilimumab for systemic therapy of metastatic melanoma. ","title":"Right atrial metastatic melanoma with unknown primaries.","pubmedId":"25802767"}
