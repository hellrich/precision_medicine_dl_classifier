Detection of RET proto-oncogene mutation is a predictor before clinical or biochemical evidence of the disease is present and leads to preventive thyroid removal since there is no effective treatment for metastases. The aim of the present study was to characterize mutations in the RET proto-oncogene in affected patients and to identify potential carriers in their families. Two families with FMTC (5 and 6 members), 4 with MEN 2A (5, 5, 4 and 3 members) and 2 with MEN 2B (5 and 1 members), were studied. DNA was obtained from blood samples in all patients and from thyroid or from pheonochromocytoma tissues in patients submitted to surgery. PCR amplification was performed using specific primers for exons 10, 11 and 16, followed by direct sequencing. Mutations at codon 634 in exon 11 were found in 16 subjects with FMTC and MEN 2A: TGC --\u003e CGC (cysteine to arginine) in 9 cases, TGC --\u003e TAC (cysteine to tyrosine) in 3, and TGC --\u003e TTC (cysteine to phenilalanine) in 4. A unique mutation of codon 918 in exon 16, ATG --\u003e ACG (methionine to threonine), was found in both MEN 2B affected patients. The mutations detected in DNA from peripheral blood were the same as those present in DNA extracted from tumor material. RET mutations were detected in all affected patients, confirming the diagnosis, and in 10 members of their families. In five of the carriers total thyroidectomy was performed. Anatomopathological study showed C-cells hyperplasia or in-situ microcarcinoma in two children (9 and 12 y) with no clinical signs of diseases and medullary thyroid carcinoma in three adults, who were previously unaware of the presence of thyroid nodules. The early detection of RET mutation followed by total thyroidectomy may prevent the development of the disease, specially in affected families, and avoid the fatal outcome of delayed medullary thyroid carcinoma diagnosis.","title":"[Early diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) by detection of mutated RET proto-oncogene carriers].","pubmedId":"9706252"}
