Subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed the presence of 1;17 translocations in four out of nine neuroblastoma cell lines. The chromosome 1 short arm breakpoints were determined using region-specific probes. FISH screening also demonstrated or confirmed the presence of 11;17 translocations in three cell lines and other chromosome 17 rearrangements in those cell lines that did not carry a t(1;17) or t(11;17). Our data extend previous cytogenetic findings and suggest that, in addition to the known involvement of chromosome 1, one or more genes on chromosome 17 also play a role in neuroblastoma development.","title":"1;17 translocations and other chromosome 17 rearrangements in human primary neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines.","pubmedId":"7520263"}
