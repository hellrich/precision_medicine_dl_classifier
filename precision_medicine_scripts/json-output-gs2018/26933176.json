Nevertheless, a small percentage of Class 1 tumors give rise to metastatic disease. The purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers of metastasis in Class 1 tumors.\nA total of 389 consecutive patients with UM were assigned to Class 1 or Class 2 using a prospectively validated 12-gene prognostic classifier. Selected tumors were further analyzed using global GEP and single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays. PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) mRNA expression was analyzed in 64 Class 1 tumors by qPCR.\nAmong Class 1 UMs, the most significant predictor of metastasis was PRAME mRNA expression (P \u003d 0.0006). The 5-year actuarial rate of metastasis was 0% for Class1(PRAME-), 38% for Class1(PRAME+), and 71% for Class 2 tumors. Median metastasis-free survival for Class1(PRAME+) patients was 88 months, compared to 32 months for Class 2 patients. Findings were validated using three independent datasets, including one using disomy 3 to identify low-risk UM. Chromosome copy number changes associated with Class1(PRAME+) tumors included gain of 1q, 6p, 8q, and 9q and loss of 6q and 11q. PRAME expression was associated with larger tumor diameter (P \u003d 0.05) and SF3B1 mutations (P \u003d 0.003).\nPRAME is an independent prognostic biomarker in UM, which identifies increased metastatic risk in patients with Class 1 or disomy 3 tumors. This finding may further enhance the accuracy of prognostic testing and precision medicine for UM.","title":"PRAME as an Independent Biomarker for Metastasis in Uveal Melanoma.","pubmedId":"26933176"}
