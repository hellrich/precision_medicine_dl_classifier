Although mutations of PTEN have often been detected in metastases of prostate cancer, localized tumors have shown lower rates of mutation, which have varied from 0 to 20% among different studies. It is unknown whether the rate of PTEN mutations is different in prostate cancer from Asian men compared with Western men. To further clarify the role of PTEN in prostate cancer and to examine the gene for mutations in Asian men, we analyzed 32 cases of primary prostate cancers from Chinese patients, each of whom was not diagnosed by screening with serum prostate-specific antigen, for PTEN mutations using the methods of tissue microdissection, single-strand conformational polymorphism, and direct DNA sequencing. Seventy % of the tumors were Gleason scores 8-10, whereas the remainder were Gleason score 7. Six metastases of prostate cancer from American patients were also analyzed. Five of 32 (16%) primary prostate cancers from Chinese men and two of six metastases from American men showed mutations in a total of 10 codons of PTEN, which involved exons 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9. Two of the mutations were truncation type, whereas the rest were missense mutations. The mutation frequency in these cases from Asian patients was higher than that in our previous study of cases in radical prostatectomy specimens from American men, in which the 40 primary tumors were lower grade and had been detected by serum prostate-specific antigen test. We conclude that mutation of PTEN occurs more often in primary prostate cancers of Chinese men, whose tumors are high grade and reflective of an unscreened population.","title":"Mutations of PTEN/MMAC1 in primary prostate cancers from Chinese patients.","pubmedId":"11234884"}
