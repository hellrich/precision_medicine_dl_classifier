Systemic ALCL is highly associated with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocations with over-expression of ALK protein. We studied ALK rearrangements using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and ALK immunohistochemical staining in 43 paediatric systemic ALCLs. FISH (performed on 35 cases) identified a translocation in 29 cases (83%). Immunohistochemistry identified ALK over-expression in 42/43 cases (97%) with the single ALK-negative case demonstrating an ALK rearrangement by FISH, indicating 100% incidence of ALK translocations.","title":"Childhood anaplastic large cell lymphoma has a high incidence of ALK gene rearrangement as determined by immunohistochemical staining and fluorescent in situ hybridisation: a genetic and pathological correlation.","pubmedId":"16351638"}
