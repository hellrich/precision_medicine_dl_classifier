The results obtained were as follows: The value of IAP in patients with malignant ovarioncus increased with the clinical progress of the disease. There was, however, no significant difference between the value in patients with malignant tumor in stage I or II and those with benign tumor. Therefore, the value has little usefulness for early diagnosis. In tissue typing of malignant ovarioncus, IAP was not positive in the case of intimoidal cancer, but it was almost on the same level in other cases. In terms of the relationship between IAP and plasma proteins or the immune index involved in various kinds of cancers, the value was closely correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and levels of CRP and mucoprotein, but not with the level of CEA, the LDH isozyme M/H ratio, or WBC and PPD skin reaction. Regardless of whether the tumor was benign or malignant, the value transiently increased postoperatively and then gradually decreased. Prognosis was poor in most cases with malignant ovarioncus, where the level of IAP remained high or rose again postoperatively. The level of serum IAP was almost correlated with the progress of the disease and is therefore useful as a marker in making a prognosis.","title":"[Studies on immunosuppressive acidic protein (IAP) in ovarian tumors].","pubmedId":"2991397"}
