The patients were classified according to the TNM staging, and the specimens of resected cancer were examined pathologically. The clinical data of these patients were analyzed.\nThe overall 5-year survival rate was 16.4%. The 5-year survival rate of the combined therapy group was 23.5%, significantly higher than that of the surgical resection alone group (P \u003c 0.01). The 5-year survival rate was 27.6% for the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 23.5% for adenocarcinoma (AC) in the combined therapy group; and was 115.2% for SCC and 9.9% for AC in the surgical resection alone group (all P \u003c 0.01).\nThe curative effectiveness of combined therapy is significantly better than surgical resection alone for stage IIIa NSCLC. However, The combination should be based on the TNM staging and pathological type.","title":"[Combined therapy for stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"16313794"}
