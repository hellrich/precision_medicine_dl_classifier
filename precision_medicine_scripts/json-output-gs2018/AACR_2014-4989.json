Reduced expression of Dsc2 has been reported in colorectal carcinomas, suggesting that Dsc2 may play a role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. Recently, down-regulated of Dsc2 expression was also found in breast, esophageal, and lung carcinomas. Dsc2 may act as tumor suppressor in various cancers. However, the role of the Dsc2 in lung cancer cells is still unclear. In this study, we report that knockdown Dsc2 expression using small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) approach can promote lung cancer cell migration and invasion abilities. Consistent with these findings, ectopic expression of Dsc2 inhibited cell migration and invasion in lung cancer cells. Additionally, we also suggested that Dsc2 inhibited lung cancer cells motility and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through down-regulate NDRG1 and Slug expression.","title":"Desmocollin 2 suppresses lung cancer cell migration and invasion through down-regulation of NDRG1 expression","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4989"}
