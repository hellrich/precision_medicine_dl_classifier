This PIK3CA mutation leads to an oncogenic activity of the PI3K pathway and contributes to therapeutic resistance to trastuzumab (T). The PI3K pathway inhibitor is therefore an attractive drug for HER2+ BC, especially in T-resistant and PIK3CA mutated conditions. Methodology: Here we have studied the in vitro and in vivo effects of BEZ235 in HER2+/T-sensitive (BT474), HER2+/T-resistant (BT474HerR) and HER2+/PIK3CA (HCC1954) mutated models. We assessed in vitro anti-proliferative and activation status of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway following BEZ235 treatment in HER2+ BC cell lines. We next evaluated the impact of BEZ235 on tumor growth and angiogenesis using xenograft models. Results: 1) BEZ235 inhibited downstream activation of the PI3K signaling pathway effectors, p-AKT (Ser473, The308), p-P70S6K, p-S6RP and p-4EBP1, 2) the anti-proliferative activity of BEZ235 was observed by 3D-ON-TOP clonogenic assay, 3) consistent with anti-proliferative effects of BEZ235, the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle increased in all three cell lines with a concomitant decrease in the S phase of their treatment with BEZ235, 4) the initiation of apoptotic activity (annexin V) of BEZ235 was significantly superior to that of RAD001, an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR, and 5) in the HER2+/T-sensitive, HER2+/T-resistant and HER2+/PIK3CA mutated BC xenograft models, BEZ235 inhibited PI3K signaling and had potent anti-tumor activity. Along with its anti-tumor effect, BEZ235 effectively decreased tumor angiogenesis (tumor micro-vessel density via CD31 staining). These inhibitions were more pronounced when BEZ235 was combined with T. Conclusions: BEZ235 inhibits the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and results in anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activity in HER2+ breast cancer cells with both wild type and mutated PIK3CA.","title":"Targeting PI3K and mTOR with BEZ235, a dual inhibitor, is efficacious in trastuzumab refractory and HER2+/PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer models","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4222"}
