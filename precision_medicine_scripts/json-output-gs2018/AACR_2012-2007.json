However, it is still unknown how BCR-ABL over-expressed cells can maintain such altered redox status, while escaping from the persistent oxidative stress-induced cell damage or apoptosis. Therefore elucidation of the mechanisms by which CML cells cope with oxidative stress will provide important insights into the molecular events leading to leukemia development and drug resistance. The major goals of this study are to investigate the role of BCR-ABL-regulated downstream cell survival factors in providing an adaptive mechanism which allows CML cells to survive in the presence of cellular oxidative stress, and to evaluate the potential therapeutic implications. Several experimental models were used to test the cellular redox status and relative sensitivity of oxidative stress-induced cell death in our study, including BCR-ABL inducible cell lines, BCR-ABL stably transformed cell lines and BCR-ABL-expressing CML blast crisis cells with different BCL-XL/BCL-2 patterns. Additionally, we established an artificial CML cell model with heterogenic BCL-XL/BCL-2 expression to assess the correlation between cell survival factor genetic background and cell sensitivity to Imatinib and oxidative stress. In this study, BCL-XL has been identified as the major survival factors responsive to BCR-ABL-promoted cellular oxidative stress and plays a dominant role in regulating the threshold of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The cell survival factors BCL-XL and BCL-2 differentially protect mitochondrial integrity under oxidative stress. BCL-XL is an essential survival factor in maintaining viability of the cells with the excessive ROS while BCL-2 seems to play a relatively minor role. In addition, combination of redox-modulating reagent -phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) with BCL-XL/BCL2 inhibitor ABT737 or suppression of BCL-XL expression by BCR-ABL inhibitor Gleevec dramatically sensitizes CML cell to ROS stress-induced apoptosis. These data together suggest that elevation of BCL-XL is important for the development of CML, and that redox-directed therapy may merit further clinical investigations in CML treatment.","title":"Differential roles of BCL-XL and BCL-2 in protecting mitochondria against oxidative stress in CML cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2007"}
