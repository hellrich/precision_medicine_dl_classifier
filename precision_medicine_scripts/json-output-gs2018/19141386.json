In this study, we analyzed relevant molecular and clinical variables in 194 primary GBMs and tested them for survival analysis. Although most of the tumors showed a mutually exclusive pattern, concurrent alterations of EGFR and p53 were detected. Survival analysis of CDK4 amplification revealed a highly significant association with a worse clinical outcome (P \u003d .01), whereas MDM2, CDK6, PTEN, and p21 were not associated with patient survival. Multivariate analysis including the significant clinical and molecular variables revealed CDK4 amplification, age, and radiotherapy to be markers with independent prognostic value. In addition, the primary GBM tumors showing simultaneous EGFR and p53 alterations were significantly associated with worse survival (P \u003c .01). These results highlight the prognostic value of CDK4 amplification and of simultaneous EGFR-p53 alterations in the clinical outcome of patients with primary GBM.","title":"Worse outcome in primary glioblastoma multiforme with concurrent epidermal growth factor receptor and p53 alteration.","pubmedId":"19141386"}
