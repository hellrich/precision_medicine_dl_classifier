We discuss both, surgical margins and functional results preoperatively and postoperative options for adjuvant therapy. The former opinion of a resistance of ACC towards chemotherapy or irradiation seems to be outdated, even though consensus about therapeutic strategies is still missing.\nWe discuss therapeutic options and compare data from literature regarding the best adjuvant therapy with the case of a 25-year-old patient with an advanced ACC of the left fossa pterygopalatina. Further we discuss alternative therapeutic options like neutron irradiation, chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Following the advice from literature, we performed an eye saving tumor resection by a left transmaxilloethmoidale sphenoidectomy via combined trans- und extranasal approach. We accepted close surgical margins for the benefit of the abandonment of dismembering measures and performed an adjuvant radiochemotherapy with taxol and carboplatin.\nWith the described therapeutic strategy we reached an optimal local tumor control with unlimited visus and without functional and cosmetic restrictions up to now. Periodic staging did not show any local tumor progress or metastatic spread hitherto.\nOrgan preserving surgery and adjuvant radiochemotherapy even in combination with taxol and carboplatin seems to be a sufficient therapeutic option in treating advanced sinunasal ACC, and might not have any prognostic disadvantages to radical surgery.","title":"[Therapeutic options in sinunasal adenoid cystic carcinomas--a case report and review].","pubmedId":"19813159"}
