We integrated data from 76 primary tumors analyzed using Illumina HumanHap550 SNP and Human-6 mRNA expression arrays. We stained a tissue microarray (TMA) of 134 NBs with anti-ALK and anti-pALK antibodies. We evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of PF-02341066, a small molecule inhibitor of ALK. Computational chemistry was used to homology map ALK interaction with PF-02341066.Results: Mutations were discovered in 38/496 NBs (8%), across the spectrum of phenotypes. R1275Q substitutions were most common (45%), followed by F1174L (15%). Evaluation of matched constitutional DNAs demonstrated 10% carried occult germline mutations. Integration of primary tumor microarrays from 76 samples showed that ALK mRNA expression was highly correlated with ALK DNA copy number (p\u003d0.0005). ALK protein was nearly universally expressed (129/134; 93%), and there was evidence for ALK activation in 15% of tumors (pALK moderate or strong staining in 20/134), suggesting an additional and alternative pathway to ALK activation. A panel of 18 NB cell lines showed differential in vitro sensitivity to PF-2341066 dependent on ALK mutation and copy number status. A wild type (WT) amplified line and 2 lines harboring R1275Q mutations were sensitive (IC50 145 - 301 nM). Lines harboring F1174L mutations were more resistant (IC50 \u003e950nM) as were lines with no ALK aberrations. Inhibition of proliferation was associated with abolishing phosphorylation of ALK, STAT3 and AKT. PF-02341066 caused complete regression of R1275Q xenografts, but caused only minimal growth delay in F1174L and WT xenografts. Based on homology mapping to a crystal structure of PF-02341066 bound to c-Met, the F1174L mutation is predicted to destabilize the specific conformation of the kinase activation loop required for binding PF-02341066.Conclusions: ALK pathway activation occurs in at least 15% of human neuroblastomas. PF-02341066 is a potent inhibitor of the most common ALK mutation, but there is a structural basis for resistance to F1174L mutations. Co-crystallization studies are ongoing and a phase 1 study is planned.","title":"Inhibition of ALK mutated neuroblastomas by the selective inhibitor PF-02341066.","pubmedId":"ASCO_35242-65"}
