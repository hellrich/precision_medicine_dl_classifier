This study was conducted to investigate the p53 gene alteration in malignant melanoma. Nineteen tumor tissues were obtained from 19 patients with malignant melanoma and examined for the expression of p53 protein by immunohistochemical staining with mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody, NCL-p53-DO-7. Twelve out of 19 cases (63%) showed positive reactions for p53 protein: 26, 21 and 16% of which had low, intermediate and high reactivity, respectively. p53 alteration more frequently expressed in female (10/12) than male patients (2/7) with malignant melanoma (p \u003c 0.05). The incidence of expression of p53 protein was compared according to the stages and the sites of tissue obtained. The positive rate for p53 protein was not significantly different between the stages. The positive rates for p53 protein were five out of five (100%), one out of two (50%) and six out of twelve (50%) in tissues obtained from the metastatic, lymph node, and primary sites, respectively. The difference in the positive rates, however, is not statistically significant. These results suggest that p53 gene is a frequent target for mutation in the development of malignant melanoma.","title":"Aberrant expression of p53 gene product in malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"7702785"}
