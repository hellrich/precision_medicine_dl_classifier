Persistent aminoacid abnormalities were found in 16 patients: two had phenylketonuria and one a severe variant form of hyperphenylalaninaemia (dihydropteridine reductase deficiency). In at least nine of the other patients, the observed abnormality was probably a secondary phenomenon. Two patients excreted excessive amounts of a glycosaminoglycan identified tentatively as hyaluronic acid. The study also uncovered one undiagnosed diabetic and three patients with urinary tract infection.","title":"Urinary screening for abnormalities of amino acid or mucopolysaccharide metabolism in patients in a hospital for the mentally handicapped in Wessex.","pubmedId":"6225873"}
