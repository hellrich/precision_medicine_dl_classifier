We report on the establishment and characterisation of two new scirrhous gastric cancer cell lines, designated OCUM-2M and OCUM-2D, derived from a 49-year-old female. OCUM-2M was derived from a primary gastric tumour, and OCUM-2D was derived from a sample of disseminated metastasis. The two cell lines were derived from the same patient. We investigated biological differences between the two cell lines to study mechanisms involved in disseminated metastasis. The growth activity of OCUM-2D cells as determined by doubling time and tumorigenicity was greater than that of OCUM-2M cells. The level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in OCUM-2D cells was about twice that of OCUM-2M cells and the growth of OCUM-2D cells was stimulated more by epidermal growth factor (EGF) than that of OCUM-2M cells. The invasive activity of OCUM-2D cells was higher than that of OCUM-2M cells and was increased after addition of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). An increase in the number of attached and spreading cells was found following the addition of 10 ng ml-1 TGF-beta 1. These findings suggest that high growth and invasive activity may play an important role in disseminated metastasis and that EGF and TGF-beta 1, which affect the growth and invasive activity of OCUM-2D cells, might be factors associated with metastasis in scirrhous gastric carcinoma. The two cell lines OCUM-2M and OCUM-2D should be beneficial for analysing mechanisms of tumour progression.","title":"Establishment of two new scirrhous gastric cancer cell lines: analysis of factors associated with disseminated metastasis.","pubmedId":"7577468"}
