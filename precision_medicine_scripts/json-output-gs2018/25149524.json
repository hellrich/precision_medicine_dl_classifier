It is characterized by frequent aberrations in two cell-cycle regulators--CDKN2A and TP53. However, LSCC has been often studied as a part of the group of head and neck cancers and not as an individual entity. In the current study we aimed to examine mutation status of CDKN2A and TP53 genes in 108 LSCC patients. DNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tumour tissues; exons 1-3 of CDKN2A and exons 5-8 of TP53 were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. Genetic aberrations in CDKN2A were found in 16 (14.2%) and those in TP53--in 56/108 (51.9%) tumours. Seven mutations (two insertions, three deletions, one missense and one silent) detected in CDKN2A were not described previously. Also, we found seven novel deletions and a novel indel in TP53. No significant associations with clinical features were found. However, TP53 mutations were predominantly observed in smokers with advanced stage tumours. Screening for genetic aberrations in a defined group of LSCC contributes to the knowledge about laryngeal carcinogenesis. Further investigations are required to confirm the observed trends in associations with clinical features.","title":"Mutational Status of CDKN2A and TP53 Genes in Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25149524"}
