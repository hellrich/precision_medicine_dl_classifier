Residual leukaemia cells were retrospectively determined by real-time PCR at different time points.\nWe can demonstrate a good correlation between the course of MRD status and clinical events in all four investigated patients.\nThese examples demonstrate the potential impact of Flt3 based MRD status not only after but also prior to allogeneic PBSCT.","title":"Analyses of minimal residual disease based on Flt3 mutations in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.","pubmedId":"15645287"}
