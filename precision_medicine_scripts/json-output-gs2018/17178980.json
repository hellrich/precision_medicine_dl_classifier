The median monthly growth rate was 0.12 mm for superficial spreading melanomas, 0.13 mm for lentigo maligna melanomas, and 0.49 mm for nodular melanomas. Rapid tumor growth was associated with tumor thickness (\u003cor\u003d1 mm, geometric mean ratio [GMR] \u003d 1.0; 1.01-4 mm, GMR \u003d 3.9; and \u003e4 mm, GMR \u003d 12.1) and mitotic rate (\u003c1/mm(2), GMR \u003d 1.0; 1-4/mm(2), GMR \u003d 2.9; 5-10/mm(2), GMR \u003d 6.1; and \u003e10/mm(2), GMR \u003d 9.7). Rapid tumor growth occurred more often in males (GMR \u003d 1.7), elderly individuals (\u003eor\u003d70 years old, GMR \u003d 2.8), and patients with fewer melanocytic nevi (n\u003c50, GMR \u003d 2.0) and fewer freckles (GMR \u003d 2.5). Rapidly growing melanomas were more often symmetrical (GMR \u003d 2.5), elevated (GMR \u003d 1.4), amelanotic (GMR \u003d 1.7), regular in border (GMR \u003d 2.5), and symptomatic (GMR \u003d 1.7).\nRapid growth of primary cutaneous melanomas is associated with aggressive histologic features and atypical clinical features. It occurs more frequently in elderly men and individuals with fewer nevi and fewer freckles.","title":"Rate of growth in melanomas: characteristics and associations of rapidly growing melanomas.","pubmedId":"17178980"}
