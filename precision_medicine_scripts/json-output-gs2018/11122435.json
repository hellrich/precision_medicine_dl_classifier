We analysed the expression and coexpression of galectin-3 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), one of the putative galectin-3 ligands, in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).\nAn immunohistochemical study using monoclonal antibodies was performed on paraffin sections of 20 cases of sporadic MTC comprising 10 cases without and 10 cases with lymph node metastases at the time of surgery. CEA expression was found in all tumours, distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm and occasionally at the cell surface. In the majority of cases (18/20) moderate to strong intensity of staining was found in most of the cells. Positive cytoplasmic staining for galectin-3 was found in 16/20 cases, but varied in intensity and distribution from weak/focal (7/16) to moderate (7/16) or strong (2/16). More intense staining for galectin-3 was mainly associated with MTC cases involving lymph node metastases. Eight out of these 10 cases showed moderate to strong galectin-3 expression concomitant with CEA expression throughout the tumour tissue.\nThese findings suggest that galectin-3 might play a role in the pathobiology of MTC. Simultaneous expression of galectin-3 and CEA in the same tumour cells at an advanced stage of MTC indicates the possibility of their autocrine cooperation during tumour progression.","title":"Galectin-3 and carcinoembryonic antigen expression in medullary thyroid carcinoma: possible relation to tumour progression.","pubmedId":"11122435"}
