This case is a 68-year-old male veteran with complaints of new-onset cognitive disorder who was found to have previously unsuspected DWS on head computed tomography. This is one of the first case studies to present complete neuropsychological test results in a veteran with DWS. Despite the level of abnormality on imaging, the veteran functioned well until onset of mild cognitive impairments in late adulthood.
