A 30-yr-old man was referred for screening of MEN 2A. Surgery for HSCR was performed at 4 yr of age. Basal and pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin levels were abnormal. Histological examination of the thyroid confirmed bilateral medullary thyroid carcinoma. Screening of family members revealed six subjects with medullary thyroid carcinoma or abnormal pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin test; one had an unilateral pheochromocytoma and two were affected with HSCR. DNA sequence analysis showed a heterozygote C618R mutation in exon 10 of the RET proto-oncogene in the proband and his mother, as well as in second-degree relatives with MEN 2A phenotype or HSCR. In this study, we report on a novel kindred with MEN 2A and HSCR phenotype associated with a point mutation (C618R) in one of the cysteine codons at the extracellular domain of the RET proto-oncogene.","title":"C618R mutation in exon 10 of the RET proto-oncogene in a kindred with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and Hirschsprung\u0027s disease.","pubmedId":"8675603"}
