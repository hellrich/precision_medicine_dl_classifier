A 46-year-old man presented with a polypoid tumor on his lower back, which was excised under clinical diagnosis of soft fibroma. The tumor proved to be polypoid melanoma. He was referred to our clinic, and examination revealed that he had the atypical mole syndrome phenotype. The clinicopathological screening of his first-degree relatives confirmed that his 58-year-old sister had the same phenotype. In addition to our discussion of the clinical significance of polypoid melanoma, we also attempted to elucidate the characteristics of the reported Japanese cases of melanomas with atypical moles from a survey of the literature, which revealed the following characteristics: 1) younger mean age than that of total Japanese melanoma cases, 2) sun sensitive skin, 3) unexpectedly and frequently observed familial incidence (Kraemer\u0027s D1 and D2), 4) frequent site of the melanoma on the trunk and none on the sole of the foot, and 5) high incidence of superficial spreading melanoma and nodular melanoma, and 6) no cases of acral lentiginous melanoma.","title":"Familial atypical mole syndrome manifesting as polypoid melanoma: a case report and review of the Japanese literature.","pubmedId":"8973034"}
