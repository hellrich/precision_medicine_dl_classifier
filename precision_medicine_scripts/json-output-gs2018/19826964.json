The aim of this study was to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations of the frequently discussed Tyr791Phe mutation in exon 13 of the RET proto-oncogene. Screening of three groups of patients was performed (276 families with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 122 families with HSCR, and 29 patients with pheochromocytoma). We found this mutation in 3 families with apparently sporadic MTC, 3 families with FMTC/MEN2, 1 patient with pheochromocytoma, and 3 families with HSCR. All gene mutation carriers have a silent polymorphism Leu769Leu in exon 13. In three families second germline mutations were detected: Cys620Phe (exon 10) in MEN2A family, Met918Thr (exon 16) in MEN2B family, and Ser649Leu (exon 11) in HSCR patient. Detection of the Tyr791Phe mutation in MEN2/MTC and also in HSCR families leads to the question whether this mutation has a dual character (gain-of-function as well as loss-of-function). A rare case of malignant pheochromocytoma in a patient with the Tyr791Phe mutation is presented. This study shows various clinical characteristics of the frequently discussed Tyr791Phe mutation.","title":"RET mutation Tyr791Phe: the genetic cause of different diseases derived from neural crest.","pubmedId":"19826964"}
