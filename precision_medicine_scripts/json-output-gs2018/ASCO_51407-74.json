Methods: Blast cytogenetic features, clinical and early disease response characteristics for two cohorts of patients (ages 1-15 vs. 16-30 years) enrolled on the current COG AALL0232 therapeutic trial for NCI high risk B-precursor ALL were compared. All patients were required to have blast cytogenetic studies for prognostically significant chromosome translocations and ploidy as well as measurements of marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry at end-induction in COG Reference Laboratories. The AALL0232 trial includes a standard 4-drug induction with a randomization to dexamethasone (10 mg/m2/day) for 14 days or prednisone (60 mg/m2/day) for 28 days. These analyses are confined to patients randomized to receive prednisone during induction therapy, as the results for the steroid randomization remain blinded. Results: 1379 eligible/evaluable patients were analyzed; 1113 patients ages 1-15 and 266 patients ages 16-30 years (AYA). AYA ALL was characterized by a male predominance (69% vs. 54%, p\u003c0.0001) and a lower initial median white blood cell count (9 vs. 33 x 109/L, p\u003c0.0001). Fewer AYA patients had the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (3.7% vs. 14.4%, p\u003c0.0001); however, simultaneous trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, 17 were more common in AYA ALL (16.0% vs. 10.2%, p\u003d0.02). There were no significant differences in the presence of very high risk features including the BCR-ABL1 fusion, MLL translocations, or hypodiploidy among the two age cohorts. End-induction MRD was negative (\u003c0.01%) in 59% of AYA patients compared to 74% of younger patients (p\u003c0.0001) and only 67% of AYA vs. 80% of younger patients (p\u003d0.0015) achieved an M1 marrow (\u003c 5% blasts) on day 15 of induction. Conclusions: AYA patients with ALL have similar very high risk cytogenetic profiles when compared to younger patients, but display slower initial responses to induction therapy, suggesting that additional biologic features in AYA ALL have yet to be discovered.","title":"Cytogenetic and early-response characteristics of adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): A Children\u0027s Oncology Group (COG) study.","pubmedId":"ASCO_51407-74"}
