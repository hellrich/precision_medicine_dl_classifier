The presence or absence of amplification was correlated with anatomic site, tumor stage, cytologic grade, histologic pattern, and mitotic activity.\nThirty-one patients (36%) showed a twofold to 10-fold amplification of 11q13 loci compared with the chromosome 11q23 ETS1 control probe. Twenty-nine of these encompassed bcl-1 through EMS1 loci; one sample showed only bcl-1 and PRAD1/cyclin D1 plus HST1 amplification, with another amplified at HST1 and EMS1 with minimal or no bcl-1 and PRAD1/cyclin D1 amplification. Amplification was significantly correlated with high cytologic grade, a diffusely infiltrative growth pattern, and with a hypopharyngeal primary site.\nChromosome 11q13 amplification in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is correlated with an aggressive histologic appearance and hypopharyngeal primary site and should be assessed in prospective clinical trials to determine its utility for treatment stratification and prognosis. Although PRAD1/cyclin D1 and EMS1 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neoplasms with 11q13 amplification, rare cases with more limited amplicon size suggest that another relevant gene or genes may exist between these loci.","title":"Chromosome 11Q13 amplification in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"8217084"}
