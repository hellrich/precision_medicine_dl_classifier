Skin neoplasia preceded hematological malignancy in the first observation. Among reports concerning the association of malignant melanoma with hematological diseases, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma and non Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma are preponderant. Epidemiological studies would be of value to predict the expected risk of malignant melanoma in hairy cell leukemia.","title":"Malignant melanoma and hairy cell leukemia.
