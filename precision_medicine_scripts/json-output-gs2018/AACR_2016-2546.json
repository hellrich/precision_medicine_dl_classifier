The author posited that familial syndromes become more organ specific with increasing age at tumour presentation to the point that very late in life, only a few organs are affected by tumours disease. The reason for this could be that the tumour originates from a more differentiated, organ-specific progenitor/stem cell later in life, while the progenitor/stem cell might be involved in organogenesis in different organs earlier in life. Examples are given for skin cancer and breast cancer.Summary: Patients with familial cancer who present with cancer at an older age at tumour presentation have a more organ restricted disease. This could be because the tumor has a more differentiated progenitor/stem cell origin. Examples are given for families with breast cancer, melanoma, and non- melanoma skin cancer.References: Olsson H. A hypothesis about tumour development and the clinical features of hereditary cancer.
