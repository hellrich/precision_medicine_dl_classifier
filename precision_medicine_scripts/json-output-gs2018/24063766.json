As frequency, it accounts about 15-20% of all breast cancers. Although in the last years there was a \"boom\" in publishing over this issue, multiple molecular classifications being elaborated, \"the triple negative breast cancer odyssey \" is still far away from ending, as the complicated molecular pathways of pathogenesis and drug resistance mechanisms remain yet insufficiently explored. The aim of this review is presentation of molecular signatures that could predict outcome and drug resistance in triple negative breast cancer.
