Tumours of patients up to 50 years of age and older were examined separately. In a number of tumours elastosis was also examined in relation to Ki-67 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) immunostaining. Sensitivity and specificity of DEL and TEL for predicting the receptor, Ki-67 and EGFR findings were estimated. Sensitivity of DEL and TEL for oestrogen and progesterone receptors is dependent on the degree of tumour differentiation and the degree of elastosis, increasing from DEL 1 degree and TEL 1 degree to DEL 3 degrees and TEL 3 degrees. It was more evident in grade 1 (G1) and G2 than in G3 carcinomas. Elastosis is a useful predictor of positive receptor findings particularly in G1 and G2 tumours with moderate and high-grade elastosis. It is a similarly useful predictor of negative receptor values in G3 carcinomas. The predictive value of DEL and TEL for the results of Ki-67 and EGFR immunostaining gradually decreases with increasing elastosis, consistent with the assumption that Ki-67 and EGFR identify the degree of tumour proliferation and invasion, while elastosis correlates with the degree of differentiation of breast cancer. Elastosis is a poor predictor of Ki-67 and EGFR findings in any individual breast cancer. Moderate and high-grade elastosis points to positive steroid hormone receptor assays in G1 and G2 carcinomas. In contrast, the lack of elastosis in G3 carcinomas may indicate a negative receptor assay. Both findings have a high degree of reliability.","title":"Relation of elastosis to biochemical and immunohistochemical steroid receptor findings, Ki-67 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) immunostaining in invasive ductal breast cancer.","pubmedId":"8389501"}
