Promising pre-clinical and clinical results with immune checkpoint inhibitors using antibodies directed against CTLA-4 and PD-1 have re-energized the field of immune-based therapies in melanoma. However, only a third of melanoma patients respond to immune checkpoint blockade. Currently available mouse xenograft and transgenic mouse melanoma models have a number of short comings and are unable to address the basis of drug resistance and immune non-responsiveness that are frequently observed in melanoma patients. Thus there is an urgent need to establish an in vivo model with a human immune microenvironment that can address issues of therapy resistance. Methods: Our laboratory has developed a humanized mouse melanoma model using patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Results: Immunodeficient NSG mice were reconstituted with human CD34+ cells and after 7-9 weeks, mature human CD45+ cells were observed in circulating blood. Humanized mice were then challenged with HLA-matched melanoma PDX and the functional ability of human immune cells to restrict tumor growth was monitored. Delayed tumor growth was observed in humanized mice indicating in vivo sensitization of human immune cells to melanoma. This was confirmed by in vitro demonstration of human lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice showing enhanced cytokine expression after stimulation with melanoma antigen peptides. Further, cytotoxic T-cells derived from melanoma peptide stimulation were able to functionally lyse tumor cells in vitro. In preliminary therapy studies, a majority of tumor-bearing humanized mice treated with anti-PD-1 antibody showed restricted tumor growth and a combination of BRAF inhibitor and anti-PD1 antibody treatment showed prolonged survival. Conclusions: Our results suggest that humanized mouse melanoma model can be explored further to understand the causes of therapy resistance and immune non-responsiveness.","title":"Immune checkpoint inhibitor responses in humanized mouse melanoma models using patient-derived xenografts.","pubmedId":"ASCO_178620-194"}
