We hypothesized that combining the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and MET inhibitor crizotinib or PDGFR/CRAF inhibitor sorafenib can increase efficacy by overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance.Methods: We designed a phase I study (3+3 design) to determine the safety of vemurafenib (240-960 mg PO BID q 28 days) with crizotinib (250 mg PO daily or BID q 28 days) in arm A or sorafenib (200 mg PO daily to 400mg PO BID q 28 days) in Arm B in patients with BRAF-mutant advanced cancers. Endpoints included maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLT), safety, response (RECIST 1.1) and plasma cell-free DNA mutation analysis.Results: To date, 29 patients (Arm A, n \u003d 11, vemurafenib 240-960mg PO BID with crizotinib 250mg PO daily; Arm B, n \u003d 18, vemurafenib 240-720mg PO BID with sorafenib 200 mg PO BID to 400/200 mg PO), median age of 53 (33-76) years; median number of 3 (1-5) prior therapies including 22 (76%) patients with prior BRAF or MEK inhibitors were treated. Patients (melanoma 17/29, 59%; papillary thyroid cancer 4/29, 14%; colorectal cancer 3/29, 10%; lung adenocarcinoma 2/29, 7%; other 3/29, 10%) had BRAF V600E (n \u003d 24), V600K (n \u003d 3) or other BRAF mutations (n \u003d 2). The MTDs have not been reached and no DLTs have been observed. Significant drug related toxicities included grade (G) 3 thrombocytopenia (n \u003d 1) in arm A and G3 hypertension (n \u003d 1), G3 headache (n \u003d 1), G3 diarrhea (n \u003d 1) in Arm B. In Arm A, 3 of 11 (27%) patients (melanoma refractory to BRAF monotherapy, -40% for 7.9 months; melanoma refractory to BRAF monotherapy, -36% for 6.0+ months and lung adenocarcinoma, -50% for 13.9 months) attained a partial response (PR) and 1 (9%) patient (melanoma refractory to MEK inhibitor, +3% for 12.5 months) with stable disease (SD) \u003e 6 months. In Arm B, 3 of 18 (17%) patients (melanoma, -46% for 7.6 months; lung adenocarcinoma, -61% for 7.3 months and ovarian cancer refractory to MEK inhibitor, -50% for 18.7 months) attained a PR and 3 (17%) patients (papillary thyroid refractory to MEK inhibitor, -10% for 28.4 months; papillary thyroid cancer refractory to BRAF inhibitor, -6% for 7.3+ months and melanoma refractory to BRAF monotherapy -8% for 7.5 months) attained SD \u003e 6 months. In patients with longitudinal assessment of plasma cfDNA changes in the amount of BRAF mutant DNA corresponded with clinical course (data will be presented).Conclusions: Preliminary data suggest that vemurafenib in combination with crizotinib or sorafenib are well tolerated with encouraging activity in patients previously treated with BRAF or MEK inhibitors.","title":"Overcoming BRAF/MEK resistance using vemurafenib with crizotinib or sorafenib in patients with BRAF-mutant advanced cancers: phase I study","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2689"}
