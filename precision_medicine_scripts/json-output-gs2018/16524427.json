In human melanoma, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is upregulated, leading to the deregulation of gene transcription. In this review, we discuss (i) the relationship between gene alteration in melanoma and upregulation of NF-kappaB, (ii) mechanisms by which activated NF-kappaB switch from pro-apoptotic to anti-apoptotic functions in melanoma and (iii) autocrine mechanisms that promote constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in metastatic melanoma.","title":"NF-kappaB activation in melanoma.","pubmedId":"16524427"}
