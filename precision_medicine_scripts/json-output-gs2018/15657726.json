The serum markers currently available for melanoma have only limited clinical use. Those most widely used in clinical applications are S100-beta, melanoma inhibitory activity, and lactate dehydrogenase; there are close correlations between the serum concentrations of these and tumor load. Regular determination of S100-beta and MIA levels during follow-up can therefore be used for early detection of a tumor relapse in melanoma patients, increased serum concentrations of these marker proteins being indicative of tumor growth. Patients with distant metastases from melanoma who present with elevated serum levels of S100-beta, MIA, or LDH have poorer overall survival than do patients whose serum concentrations are within normal ranges. These three markers can also be used to monitor the course of disease and therapy outcome in patients with distant metastases. Since there are no marker proteins for melanoma that are not dependent on tumor load, it is not currently possible to forecast the survival of patients who are tumor free after surgery. Serum markers are also not suitable for screening or for the diagnosis of primary melanomas.","title":"[Serum markers for melanoma].","pubmedId":"15657726"}
