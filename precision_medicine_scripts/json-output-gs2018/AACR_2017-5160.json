Aberrant signalling via the MAPK pathway is commonly seen in cancer. RAF inhibitors such as Dabrafenib and Vemurafenib have been approved for the treatment of unresectable and metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma, but these agents lack efficacy in BRAF mutant colorectal cancer (CRC), partly because of EGFR-mediated feedback reactivation of the MAPK pathway via CRAF. Furthermore, RAF inhibitor treatment of RAS-mutant, BRAF wildtype melanomas has been associated with other skin cancers, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma due to MAPK pathway paradoxical activation mediated by CRAF. There is therefore a clinical need for novel agents targeting the MAPK pathway that do not have these undesirable properties. Here we present, REDX05358 that demonstrates subnanomolar binding affinity for BRAF and CRAF with high selectivity profile against a panel of 468 kinases that exhibits negligible paradoxical activation due to inhibition of both RAF monomers and dimers. As a result, REDX05358 not only inhibits MAPK signalling in BRAF V600E mutant tumor cells, but also in those harbouring NRAS and KRAS mutations. Furthermore, REDX05358 does not induce feedback reactivation of the pathway through its ability to sustain inhibition of MAPK signalling in CRC cell lines. Correspondingly, profiling of REDX05358 in a panel of CRC, melanoma and NSCLC cell lines shows it has potent anti-proliferative activity in cell lines harbouring BRAF or RAS mutations. REDX05358 is an orally bioavailable, well tolerated small molecule that has demonstrated in vivo efficacy in BRAF V600E CRC xenograft model. In contrast, first generation inhibitors such as Vemarafenib and Dabrafanib have been reported to be ineffective in this genetic background in CRC cell lines and patients. Thus, we have developed a pan RAF inhibitor with unique pharmacological properties enabling it to have utility in treating BRAF and RAS mutant cancers","title":"Development of REDX05358, a novel highly selective and potent pan RAF inhibitor and a potential therapeutic for BRAF and RAS mutant tumors.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-5160"}
