In that setting, we hypothesized that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels during PD1 blockade could reflect the tumor burden and may even differentiate lymphocytic infiltrates of tumor deposits from true tumor progressions. Methods: All patients (pts) starting a therapy with on-label nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Institut Curie were eligible for this ethically approved prospective study. After signed informed consent, patients had up to four blood draws: (i) before therapy; (ii) after 2 months; (iii) at tumor progression; (iv) in case of toxicity. Optimized pre-analytical procedures were applied on EDTA tubes. Circulating DNA was extracted using the QIAamp kit and quantified by Qubit. ctDNA was then quantified by detecting either (subgroup A) previously characterized point mutations for which ddPCR or biPAP-PCR (Madic, Clin Cancer Res 2012) probes were available or (subgroup B) previously unknown mutations discovered by a targeted massively parallel sequencing of cancer-related genes in plasma (Lebofsky, Mol Oncol 2015). Results were correlated with prospectively registered radiological evaluations (RECIST \u0026 irRC) and clinical outcomes. Results: Thirty-six pts (N \u003d 23 NSCLC, N \u003d 11 melanoma, N \u003d 2 MSI-H GI cancers) have been included from July to November 2015. ddPCR and biPAP-PCR was performed in the first seven pts with known KRAS, BRAF, GNAQ or GNA11 mutations in (subgroup A). The only pt with rising ctDNA levels in the first two months of therapy (50 to 1200 copies/ml of plasma) experienced a tumor progression. The two other pts with confirmed tumor progression had stable (600 to 500 copies/ml) or undetectable (0 to 0 copy/ml) ctDNA levels. As expected, stable disease and partial responses (N \u003d 4) were associated with decreased (210 to 0) or undetectable (0 to 0) levels. Mutation discovery by targeted massively parallel sequencing (subgroup B) is ongoing and will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: This first proof of concept study suggests that early ctDNA levels changes may be a tool to manage anti-PD1 therapy efficacy.","title":"Monitoring anti-PD-1 therapy efficacy by circulating tumor DNA: a prospective cohort.","pubmedId":"ASCO_170077-176"}
