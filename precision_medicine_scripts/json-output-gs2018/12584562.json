Here we have determined the influence of alpha6beta1 integrin on erbB2 signaling in anchorage-independent growth, using MDA-MB435 breast cancer cells. Firstly, we transfected the cells with erbB2 cDNA, and isolated cells with high or low levels of alpha6beta1 integrin by cell sorting (alpha6H-ErbB and alpha6L-ErbB). We found that an erbB ligand, heregulin beta1, enhanced growth activity of alpha6L-ErbB cells, but not alpha6H-ErbB cells. Secondly, we established cells expressing a beta4 integrin deletion mutant (beta4-deltacyt), which selectively inhibited alpha6beta1 integrin expression and adhesion to laminin-1. Again, heregulin beta1 enhanced the growth of erbB2 cDNA-transfected beta4-deltacyt cells, but not mock cells. Western blot analysis revealed that heregulin beta1 stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream molecules, GSK3beta and p70S6kinase, and that the extent of phosphorylation was greater in ErbB2/beta4-deltacyt cells than ErbB2/mock cells. Furthermore, we found that the erbB2 cytoplasmic domain was truncated in ErbB2/mock cells, which was independent of ligand stimulation and adhesion, and was suppressed by proteasome inhibitors. These results suggest that alpha6beta1 integrin inhibits erbB2 signals by inducing proteasome-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the erbB2 cytoplasmic domain, and may thereby contribute to the regulation of tumor growth.","title":"Alpha6beta1 integrin induces proteasome-mediated cleavage of erbB2 in breast cancer cells.","pubmedId":"12584562"}
