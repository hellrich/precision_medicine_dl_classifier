Fifty cases did not fit into the previously mentioned categories. SYT FISH (96% of monophasic synovial sarcomas were positive; 0% of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor were positive) and DDIT3 FISH (100% of myxoid/round cell liposarcomas; no other neoplasm positive) were very sensitive and specific. EWSR1 FISH was very sensitive and specific in the differential diagnosis of melanocytic neoplasms (88% of clear cell sarcomas were positive; all melanomas were negative). EWSR1 FISH was sensitive among high-grade round cell sarcomas (positive in 100% of desmoplastic small round cell tumors and 96% of Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors) but not specific because clear cell sarcoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and a subset of round cell liposarcomas also harbor rearrangements of EWSR1. FUS FISH was very sensitive in detecting low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas (91% positive) but not specific because most myxoid/round cell liposarcomas also contain rearrangements of FUS. All atypical lipomatous tumors were positive for amplification of MDM2, whereas all lipomas were negative. FOXO1A FISH was positive in ∼70% of cases of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.\nFISH is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of mesenchymal neoplasms.","title":"Utilization of fluorescence in situ hybridization in the diagnosis of 230 mesenchymal neoplasms: an institutional experience.","pubmedId":"21128778"}
