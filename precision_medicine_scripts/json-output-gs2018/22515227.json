We report the case of a 74-year-old female who underwent surgical revision of a polyethylene-based right total knee prosthesis due to chronic wear. At the time of surgery, a soft tissue mass adjacent to the tibial prosthetic insert was noted and excised. Histopathologic examination revealed a sheet-like proliferation of large, histiocytoid cells within the subcutis and superficial fascia. The cells showed abundant eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm and small round bland nuclei. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed the cells to be positive only for CD68. In addition, abundant PAS-positive cytoplasmic granules were found, and minute particles of polarizable material were noted intracellularly and scattered throughout the interstitium of the infiltrate. These findings were interpreted as consistent with a reactive, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis secondary to the patient\u0027s polyethylene knee prosthesis. This finding appears to be a local correlate of the process previously described in regional lymph nodes as reactive granular histiocytosis. Dermatopathologists should be cognizant of this uncommon reaction pattern to avoid mistaking it for a neoplastic process.","title":"Reactive granular histiocytosis secondary to arthroplasty prosthesis: a novel reaction pattern.","pubmedId":"22515227"}
