Case 1 is a 34-year-old female who developed a tumor in the left frontal pole, and Case 2 is a 46-year-old male with a left frontal tumor. Both tumors were surgically excised and the patients received postoperative chemo-radiotherapy. Histological re-evaluation of the resected tumor tissue confirmed the most malignant type of glioma-glioblastoma. We speculate that the entire extent of tumors had been extirpated by surgery in both cases.","title":"Clinical cure of glioblastoma--two case reports.","pubmedId":"10853323"}
