Many of these cells belong to the mononuclear phagocyte system. The aim of this review is to study the interactions between mononuclear phagocytes and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tissue. The role of inflammation in tumours and the cytokine interleukin-6 will be highlighted. Future therapy strategies in the treatment of head and neck cancer might be directed towards mononuclear phagocytes and their cytokine production.","title":"Mononuclear phagocytes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"19967383"}
