Millerenolide and thieleanin showed a similar pattern of cytotoxicity with the greatest effect on viability being evident with A549 human lung cancer cells (IC(50) - 40 and 32 microM respectively), and with the 3T3/HER2 cell line which are 3T3 mouse fibroblasts transfected with the HER2 oncogene (IC(50) - 16 and 28 microM respectively). The parent 3T3 cells and the B16/BL6 mouse melanoma cells were less sensitive to these compounds, with thieleanin showing an IC(50) with B16/BL6 greater than the highest dose tested (203 microM). Treatment with millerenolide (8 mg/kg, i.p. on days 0, 2 and 4 post-inoculation) significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous B16/BL6 tumors in C57BL/6 mice, (50% inhibition at day 25, P\u003d0.015), as well as retarding the appearance of detectable tumor (millerenolide - day 15.2+/-0.4 vs control - day 12.8+/-0.5, mean+/-SEM, P\u003d0.011). In contrast, treatment with thieleanin (8 mg/kg every other day up to the day of kill) neither retarded the appearance of the tumor nor its growth.","title":"Anticancer activities of two sesquiterpene lactones, millerenolide and thieleanin isolated from Viguiera sylvatica and Decachaeta thieleana.","pubmedId":"18534779"}
