Patients with loss of CDKN2A (p16), an inherent negative regulator of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, were not separately studied because of the significant response of the patients selected based only on receptor status. Here, we report a patient with metastatic estrogen receptor- positive, her2-negative breast cancer with CDKN2A loss who experienced a clinical response to palbociclib.
