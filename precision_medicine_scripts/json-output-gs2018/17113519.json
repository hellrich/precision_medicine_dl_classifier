There is doubt regarding a definite association between these two diseases despite a number of case reports and clear, potential pathological mechanisms. This case not only strengthens support for an association but also highlights the great difficulties that arise in the management of cutaneous melanomata in patients with neurofibromatosis.","title":"Multiple malignant melanomas in association with neurofibromatosis type 1.","pubmedId":"17113519"}
