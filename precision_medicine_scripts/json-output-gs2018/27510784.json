Strong and diffuse cytoplasmic BRAF staining was noted in 4 of 24 cases (17%), while 1 of 24 cases (4%) showed weak staining, and 19 of 24 cases (79%) had no staining. The four cases with strong BRAF immunostain were confirmed to have BRAF mutations, including 3 cases in the stomach and 1 case in the small intestine. All tumors showed spindle cell morphology. Only one case had progressive disease. No BRAF mutations were detected in cases with weak or negative BRAF immunostain.\nBRAF V600E mutation-specific immunohistochemistry is a highly sensitive and specific marker for detecting BRAF-mutated GISTs.","title":"[Application of BRAF V600E mutation-specific immunohistochemistry in diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors].","pubmedId":"27510784"}
