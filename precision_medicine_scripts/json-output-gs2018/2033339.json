A 73-year-old female suffered from sudden chest pain, dyspnea and dizziness and admitted to a local clinic on emergency. A diagnosis of bilateral multiple pulmonary infarction was made by lung perfusion scintigraphy. However, a mass migrating between the right atrium and the right ventricle across the tricuspid valve was demonstrated by echocardiography, and the patient was referred to us under a diagnosis of myxoma complicated with pulmonary infarction. Incision of the right atrium disclosed a gelatinous mass resembling frog eggs, attached to the right ventricle side of the anterior cusp of the tricuspid valve and swinging across the orifice of the valve. The gross lesion was removed completely. Since the histological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma, no surgery was performed on the pulmonary artery. Postoperative re-examination by ultrasonography and CT revealed thyroid cancer as the primary lesion.","title":"[Surgical resection of cardiac metastasis of thyroid cancer--a case report].","pubmedId":"2033339"}
