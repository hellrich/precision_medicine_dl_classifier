It represents 8 to 10% of all extracranial tumors in childhood. The purpose of this paper is to report a case in which a mandibular soft tissue mass was the initial presenting sign of disseminated neuroblastoma in a 2-year-old child, and to discuss the clinicopathologic features and biologic behavior of neuroblastoma.","title":"Disseminated neuroblastoma with initial presentation as an intraoral mass: case report.","pubmedId":"7937266"}
