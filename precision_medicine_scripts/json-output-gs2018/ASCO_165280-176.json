However, the immune environment and targets of these treatments such as program death receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 have not been well characterised in MM. In a large cohort of patients, we investigated PD-L1 expression, the surrounding immune infiltrate and genome-wide copy number status and correlated these parameters to clinicopathological features. Methods: Tissue microarrays (TMA) were constructed and stained with PD-L1 (E1L3N, CST, Massachusetts), CD4, CD8 and Foxp3 antibodies. PD-L1 positivity (PD-L1+) was defined as \u003e 5% membranous staining regardless of intensity and high positive as \u003e 50%. Genomic DNA obtained from tumour of a representative subset (68 patients) was used for genome-wide copy number analysis (CNA) using Affymetrixs OncoScan platform. Percent Genome Aberrated (PGA) was computed for each sample. Results: Amongst 329 patients evaluated, the median age was 67 years. Most were male 274(83.2%). Epithelioid histology (N \u003d 203; 62.9%) was the commonest. PD-L1+ was seen in 41.7% with high positivity in 9.6%. PD-L1+ correlated with nonepitheloid histology (P \u003d \u003c 0.0001) and increased infiltration with CD4, CD8 and FOXP3 lymphocytes. High PD-L1 expression correlated with worse prognosis (HR \u003d 2.37; 95%CI: 1.57-3.56; P \u003d \u003c 0.0001) on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis histology, stage, Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and ECOG status were found to be independently associated with survival, but not PD-L1+. PD-L1 gene (CD274) copy number gains were seen in seven (11.2%) of patients but did not correlate with PD-L1 expression. Higher PGA was seen in epithelioid histology, was not associated with PD-L1 expression but trended towards poorer survival (HR \u003d 1.5; 95%CI: 0.89-2.68; P \u003d 0.14). Conclusions: High PD-L1 expression was associated with non-epithelioid MM, poor clinical outcome and increased immunological infiltrates. Interestingly, increased genomic alterations did not correlate with PD-L1 expression but was associated with poorer survival.","title":"Correlation of PD-L1 expression with immune cell infiltrates, genome-wide copy number aberrations and survival in mesothelioma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_165280-176"}
