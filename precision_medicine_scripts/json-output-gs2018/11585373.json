Local recurrence during the following year prompted repeated surgical resection, tumor embolization, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Despite aggressive therapy, the tumor progressed. A thyroid mass was first noted 2 years after the meningioma was diagnosed. Enlargement of the mass caused airway obstruction, necessitating an emergency thyroidectomy. Histologic examination of the thyroidectomy specimen showed that the thyroid gland had been extensively replaced by metastatic meningioma.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first reported case of metastatic meningioma extensively infiltrating the thyroid gland. This case report expands the spectrum of tumors that metastasize to the thyroid gland.","title":"Meningioma metastatic to thyroid gland.","pubmedId":"11585373"}
