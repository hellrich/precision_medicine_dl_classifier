While surgery, chemotherapy and radiation remain the mainstay of upfront treatment, recent advances in molecular interrogation of pLGG have shown a small number of recurring genetic mutations in these tumors that might be exploited therapeutically. Notable findings include abnormalities in the RAS/MAP kinase pathway such as NF-1 loss or BRAF activation and mTOR activation. Recent identification of activating re-arrangements in c-MYB and MYBL1 in pediatric diffuse astrocytoma also provide candidates for therapeutic intervention. Targeting these molecularly identified pathways may allow for improved outcomes for patients as pediatric oncology moves into the era of biology-driven medicine.","title":"New strategies in pediatric gliomas: molecular advances in pediatric low-grade gliomas as a model.","pubmedId":"23881924"}
