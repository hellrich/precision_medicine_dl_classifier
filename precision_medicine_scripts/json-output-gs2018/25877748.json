However, it is unknown whether second-line platinum-based chemotherapy after epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy could lead to better outcomes. We evaluated the efficacy of second-line platinum-based chemotherapy after gefitinib for advanced non-small cell lung cancers harboring epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (the NEJ002 study).\nSeventy-one non-small cell lung cancers, treated with gefitinib as first-line therapy and then receiving platinum-based chemotherapy as second-line therapy were evaluated in NEJ002. Patients were evaluated for antitumor response to second-line chemotherapy by computed tomography according to the criteria of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors group (version 1.0).\nOf the 71 patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib, a partial response was documented in 25.4% (18/71), stable disease in 43.7% (31/71) and progression of disease in 21.1% (15/71). The objective response and disease control rates were 25.4% (18/71) and 69% (49/71), respectively. There was no significant difference between first- and second-line chemotherapy in objective response and disease control rates for advanced non-small cell lung cancer harboring activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. In the analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation types, the objective responses of deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 (L858R) were 27.3% (9/33) and 28.1% (9/32), respectively, but these differences between objective response rates were not significant.\nThe efficacy of second-line platinum-based chemotherapy followed at progression by gefitinib was similar to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, and epidermal growth factor receptor mutation types did not influence the efficacy of second-line platinum-based chemotherapy.","title":"Efficacy of chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib therapy in EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer-data from a randomized Phase III study comparing gefitinib with carboplatin plus paclitaxel (NEJ002).","pubmedId":"25877748"}
