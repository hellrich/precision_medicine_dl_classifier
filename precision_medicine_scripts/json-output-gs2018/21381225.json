Basaloid tumors are the most difficult problem in salivary gland fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). There are various benign and malignant tumors such as; cellular pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, metastatic basal cell carcinoma, metastatic basaloid squamous carcinoma and small cell carcinoma in differential diagnosis. We present a case of BCA, membranous type in a 39-year-old female with right submandibular swelling misinterpreted as adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) on FNAC.","title":"Basal cell adenoma: a diagnostic dilemma on fine needle aspiration cytology.","pubmedId":"21381225"}
