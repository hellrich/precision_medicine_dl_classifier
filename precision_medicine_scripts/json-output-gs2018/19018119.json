It rarely occurs in patients who are less than 40 years old (0.4-5.5%). However, since it is so rare, when cases occur they are often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated leading to delay in definitive treatment. This report describes a case of squamous cell carcinoma, involving the posterolateral border of the tongue of a 19-year-old female patient, with no deleterious habits usually associated with oral cancer. This report focuses on the etiological factors and prognosis related to the case. Additionally, a brief literature review regarding squamous cell carcinoma in young patients is also included.","title":"Squamous cell carcinoma of tongue in a 19-year-old female.","pubmedId":"19018119"}
