Survival curves were performed with Kaplan-Meier method and annual recurrence hazard was estimated by hazard function. We observed that the rate of larger tumors in triple negative patients was higher than that in HR+/ERBB2- women, but lower than that in ERBB2+ subgroup (P \u003d 0.0001). In addition, 21.83% of triple negative patients had four or more axillary lymph nodes involved as compared to 27.40% of ERBB2+ women and 22.75% of HR+/ERBB2- subgroup (P \u003d 0.0056). In the survival analysis, we found a statistical significance for recurrence-free survival (RFS) among the three subgroups (P \u003d 0.0037), with the rate of 72.89% for ERBB2+ patients, 78.40% for HR+/ERBB2- ones and 75.76% for triple negative ones at the 11th year respectively. When it came to hazard peaks, discrepancies existed in different subgroups. Similar to HR+/ERBB2- patients, triple negative subgroup showed an early major recurrence surge peaking at approximately year 2.5 as opposed to ERBB2+ counterparts with a tapering sharp at the 1st year. Furthermore, the first peak of triple negative tumors was higher than that of HR+/ERBB2- patients, but lower than that of ERBB2+ ones. Therefore, our findings suggested biological characteristics and prognostic outlook of Chinese triple negative breast cancers might be more favorable and somewhat different from those in Western populations.","title":"Clinicopathological features of the triple-negative tumors in Chinese breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"18563552"}
