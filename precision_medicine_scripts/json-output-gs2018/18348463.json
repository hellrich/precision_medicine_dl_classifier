There are certain \u0027hot-spots\u0027 in the p53 gene where mutations are commonly found that result in a mutated dipyrimidine site. This review discusses the role of p53 from normal function and its dysfunction in precancerous lesions, nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers. Additionally, molecules that associate with p53 and alter its function to produce neoplastic conditions are also explored in this chapter.","title":"P53 protein and pathogenesis of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer.","pubmedId":"18348463"}
