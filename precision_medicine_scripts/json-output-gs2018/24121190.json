Despite the choice of treatments, survival remains poor, exceeding 1 year only in patients with solitary metastases and absence of extracranial disease. A total of 115 consecutive MBM patients observed between 1994 and 2010 were included in an historical cohort study. Demographic, clinical data and tumour characteristics were collected and survival status was ascertained across the follow-up window. The statistical associations between individual and tumour data and overall survival were investigated using Kaplan-Meier survival function and Cox\u0027s multiple regression analysis. The median survival was 4.3 months (95% confidence interval 2.6-6.1). Patients who underwent surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery showed a significantly (P\u003c0.001) better prognosis than those who received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy or supportive therapies. Patients without clinical symptoms experienced a statistically significant better survival (P\u003d0.02) than patients with clinical symptoms; analogue difference was observed to be in favour of patients whose symptoms improved after the first treatment of MBM (P\u003c0.001). The presence of symptoms, clinical outcome and first treatment received were the only independent variables to predict survival. Patients who cannot receive surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery have the worst overall survival.
