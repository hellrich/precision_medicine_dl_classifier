The cytotoxic activity was also heterogeneous, and no TIL developed a tumour-specific cytotoxic activity. The phenotypic profile and cytotoxic activity were also tested after thawing, and this study demonstrated that TIL can be frozen at the time of the nephrectomy, then thawed and cultured for the purposes of therapeutic trials when metastases appear. The differences between TIL derived from renal cell carcinoma and TI1 derived from melanoma are discussed.","title":"Phenotypic and functional analysis of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes from patients with renal cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"8137857"}
