Tp53 protein may be inactivated by the binding of the MDM2 protein. MDM2, the product of the mdm2 gene, is an oncoprotein that binds to Tp53 and inhibits the p53-mediated transactivation. MDM2 overexpression has been reported in several human cancers, but not in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Therefore, we have evaluated the immunohistochemical overexpression of MDM2 and the relationship between its expression and histological grade, clinicopathological features, Tp53 overexpression, and Ki-67 labeling index in 47 cases of ICC. MDM2 and Tp53 were found to be overexpressed in 38% and 57% of the tumor, respectively. MDM2 and Tp53 were not expressed in non-tumorous liver tissue. There was no significant difference between the MDM2 overexpression and ICC tumor grade. However, MDM2 overexpression correlated with the presence of metastases (P\u003c0.01) and advanced tumor stage (P\u003c0.05). MDM2 overexpression also correlated with Tp53 overexpression (P\u003c0.03) and Ki-67 labeling index (P\u003c0.03). Our findings suggest that MDM2 overexpression may play a role in the late stage of human ICC.","title":"Overexpression of MDM2 protein in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: relationship with p53 overexpression, Ki-67 labeling, and clinicopathological features.","pubmedId":"10963376"}
