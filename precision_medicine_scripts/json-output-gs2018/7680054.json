There is a substantial reduction in S-100+ LC and a lesser decline in CD1+ LC in the epidermis over melanoma. There is a simultaneous increase in the frequency of cells expressing these phenotypes in the dermis deep to tumor. Double-staining studies in progress show coexpression of S-100 and CD1 in most of these cells. The depletion of S-100+/CD1+ DC from the peritumoral epidermis is maximum in deeper (Clark level III-V) and thicker (\u003e 0.76 mm) tumors. The reduction in total DC in peritumoral epidermis is, however, proportionally less than the reduction in S-100+/CD1+ DC owing to an increase in cells that are S-100-/CD1+. The proportion of S-100+/CD1+ dermal DC deep to tumor is similar to that in normal epidermis and dermis, suggesting that there is no increased migration of S-100-/CD1+ DC from tumor-associated epidermis to subjacent dermis. Non-dendritic leukocytes in the dermis deep to tumor were increased in frequency, maximally in the dermis deep to thinner and more superficial melanomas. Most such cells were T lymphocytes with helper/inducer cells predominating. The data presented show substantial alterations in the frequency, distribution, and phenotype of LC/DC as melanoma evolves, alterations that may be critical for development of effective tumor-directed immunity.","title":"Variations in the distribution, frequency, and phenotype of Langerhans cells during the evolution of malignant melanoma of the skin.","pubmedId":"7680054"}
