The primary endpoint was pathologic complete remission (pCR) in the breast and axilla. To detect an assumed 35% pCR absolute difference between the two schedules, a minimum of 26 assessable patients in each group was required (two-sided α \u003d 0.05, β \u003d 0.2).\nA total of 56 patients were enrolled (weekly group, n \u003d 29; every-3-weeks group, n \u003d 27). In the intent-to-treat analysis, pCR in the breast/axilla were found in 31 patients (55%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 41%-69%). Compared with the every-3-weeks schedule, the weekly administration achieved higher pCR (41% vs. 69%; p \u003d .03). After adjustment for clinical and pathological factors, the weekly administration was more effective than the every-3-weeks schedule, with hazard ratio of 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1-0.9; p \u003d .03). Interestingly, weekly administration resulted in high pCR rates in both luminal-B (HER2-positive) and ERBB2+ tumors (67% vs. 71%; p \u003d .78), whereas luminal-B (HER2-positive) tumors benefited less from the every-3-weeks schedule compared with the ERBB2+ tumors (21% vs. 62%, p \u003d .03). These results remain after multivariate adjustment, showing weekly administration was more effective in the luminal-B (HER2-positive) subgroup (p \u003d .02) but not in the ERBB2+ subgroup (p \u003d .50).\nA more frequent administration might improve the possibility of eradicating invasive cancer in the breast and axilla, especially in the luminal-B (HER2-positive) subtype. Further studies to validate our findings are warranted.","title":"Weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab therapy improves pathologic complete remission in aggressive HER2-positive breast cancers, especially in luminal-B subtype, compared with a once-every-3-weeks schedule.","pubmedId":"23635560"}
