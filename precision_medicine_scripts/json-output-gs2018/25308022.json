We report here a case of FATWO in a 70-year-old woman arising from the broad ligament and confirmed on immunohistochemistry. Most of these tumors behave in a benign fashion but certain histological features like hypercellularity, cellular pleomorphism and nuclear atypia as seen in the index case may increase the rate of recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, close follow-up is recommended for FATWO. ","title":"Female adnexal tumor of probable Wolffian origin.","pubmedId":"25308022"}
