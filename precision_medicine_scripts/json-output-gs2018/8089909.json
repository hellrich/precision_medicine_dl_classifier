Acute leukemias (62.8%) were commoner than chronic (37.2%). Amongst acute leukemias, myeloid leukemias (AML) were more frequent as compared to lymphoblastic (ALL). AML:ALL ratio was 2.57:1 in adults and 1:3 in children. Amongst AML cases, M4 was the commonest, followed by M2, M1, M3 and M4 and M6 and M7 respectively. In ALL patients, L1 was the commonest, followed by L2 and L3 respectively. Amongst chronic leukemias, myelocytic leukemia (CML) was more common than lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with a CML:CLL ratio of 3.1:1. In a total of 60 CML cases, two had juvenile CML, four were between 10 and 15 years of age and the remaining 54 were adults. Hairy cell leukemia (2 cases) and lymphoma/leukemia syndrome (5 cases) were uncommon.","title":"A morphological pattern of 234 cases of leukemias.","pubmedId":"8089909"}
