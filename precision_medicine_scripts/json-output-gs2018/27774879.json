Available treatment options, i.e. surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapies are not effective in improving prognosis, so an alternate therapy is insistent. Plant based drugs are efficient due to their synergistic action, multi-targeted approach and least side effects. Present investigation reports the strong anti-tumorous potential of Nardostachys jatamansi rhizome extract (NJRE) on U87 MG glioblastoma cells. Its IC50 was 33.73±3.5, 30.59±3.4 and 28.39±2.9 µg/mL, respectively after 24, 48 and 72 h. NJRE at 40 µg/mL induced DNA fragmentation, indicating apoptosis, early apoptosis began in the cells at 20 µg/mL, whereas higher doses exhibited late apoptosis as revealed by dual fluorescence staining . NJRE at 60 and 80 µg /mL caused a G0/G1 arrest and at 20 and 40 µg/mL showed excessive nucleation and mitotic catastrophe in the cells. The immuno-blotting studies further validated the apoptotic mode of cell death through intrinsic pathway. These studies for the first time proved a strong dose specific and time dependent anti-proliferative effect of NJRE on U87 MG cells. Notably, the extract proved harmless to normal cells. In silico docking of NJRE marker compounds: oroselol, jatamansinol, nardostachysin, jatamansinone and nardosinone have revealed their synergistic and multi-targeted interactions with Vestigial endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), Cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), Beta-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The extract can be used for the development of safe and multi-targeted therapy to manage glioblastoma.","title":"Strong anti-tumorous potential of Nardostachys jatamansi rhizome extract on glioblastoma and in silico analysis of its molecular drug targets.","pubmedId":"27774879"}
