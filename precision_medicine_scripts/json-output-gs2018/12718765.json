However, efforts to manipulate expression of the human CD40L (hCD40L) molecule have foundered on problems associated with lack of consistent gene transfer into the malignant target cells. We now describe a new, highly reproducible method for inducing hCD40L surface expression on malignant B cells, which is dependent on intercellular transfer of the hCD40L protein from donor gene-modified fibroblasts to patient tumor cells. Ten B-CLL samples were cocultured with MRC-5 fibroblasts (a human embryonic lung cell line) previously transduced with an adenoviral vector encoding the hCD40L gene. The malignant cells expressed high levels of surface hCD40L, B7-1, B7-2, and ICAM-1 after coculture. Upregulation of B7-1 and B7-2 was cycloheximide inhibitable and was a consequence of CD40 activation. However, inhibition of protein synthesis had no effect on the ability of B-CLL cells to acquire surface expression of hCD40L. hCD40L surface expression required cell-to-cell contact, but was independent of CD40 engagement. hCD40L transfer was not mediated by membrane fusion. The transferred hCD40L was functionally intact and B-CLL cells expressing this molecule induced increased interferon-gamma production from autologous peripheral blood T lymphocytes. This approach does not use any direct gene transfer to primary leukemia cells and can readily be scaled up for production of clinical B-CLL vaccines.","title":"Bystander transfer of functional human CD40 ligand from gene-modified fibroblasts to B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.","pubmedId":"12718765"}
