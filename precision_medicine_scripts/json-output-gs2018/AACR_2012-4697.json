Due to its significant role in DNA repair, APE1 is a viable target for chemotherapeutic drugs; inhibition of DNA repair activity of APE1 potentates the cytotoxic effect of lesions caused by DNA-reactive drugs. Using a combination of in silico screening as well as in vitro enzyme-inhibition assays, we identified strong in vitro inhibitors (IC50 \u003c 1 M) of the APE1 protein. Using human glioblastoma (T98G) cells, it was demonstrated that these inhibitors potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA damaging agents, especially alkylators, and that these compounds also cause increased accumulation of intracellular abasic sites. We investigated the association of the inhibitors with APE1 protein and DNA by means of CD, UV and fluorescence spectroscopies, and by a fluorescent intercalator/groove binder displacement assay.","title":"Identification, characterization and effects of inhibitors of the human Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endonuclease 1 (APE1) protein","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-4697"}
