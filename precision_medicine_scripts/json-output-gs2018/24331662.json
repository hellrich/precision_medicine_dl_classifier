We examined the role of the PTEN/PDGF axis on radioresponse using a murine PTEN null prostate epithelial cell model.\nPTEN wild-type (PTEN+/+) and PTEN knockout (PTEN-/-) murine prostate epithelial cell lines were used to examine the relationship between the PTEN status and radiosensitivity and also to modulate the PDGF D expression levels. PTEN-/- cells were transduced with a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral vector containing either scrambled nucleotides (SCRM) or sequences targeted to PDGF D (shPDGF D). Tumorigenesis and morphogenesis of these cell lines were evaluated in vivo via subcutaneous injection of male nude mice and in vitro using Matrigel 3-dimensional (3D) culture. Effects of irradiation on clonogenic survival, cell migration, and invasion were measured with respect to the PTEN status and the PDGF D expression level. In addition, apoptosis and cell cycle redistribution were examined as potential mechanisms for differences seen.\nPTEN-/- cells were highly tumorigenic in animals and effectively formed foci in 3D culture. Importantly, loss of PDGF D in these cell lines drastically diminished these phenotypes. Furthermore, PTEN-/- cells demonstrated increased clonogenic survival in vitro compared to PTEN+/+, and attenuation of PDGF D significantly reversed this radioresistant phenotype. PTEN-/- cells displayed greater migratory and invasive potential at baseline as well as after irradiation. Both the basal and radiation-induced migratory and invasive phenotypes in PTEN-/- cells required PDGF D expression. Interestingly, these differences were independent of apoptosis and cell cycle redistribution, as they showed no significant difference.\nWe propose that PDGF D represents a potentially promising target for PCa treatment resistance in the absence of PTEN function, and warrants further laboratory evaluation and clinical study.","title":"A critical role of the PTEN/PDGF signaling network for the regulation of radiosensitivity in adenocarcinoma of the prostate.","pubmedId":"24331662"}
