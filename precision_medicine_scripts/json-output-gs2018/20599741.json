For melanoma, metabolic studies have solely focused on high glucose uptake. By contrast, little is known regarding addiction to glutamine. Using five melanoma lines and two normal cell types, addition of aminooxyacetate (AOA), an inhibitor of glutamate-dependent transaminase regulating glutaminolytic pathway, two lines underwent low levels of apoptosis (\u003e30%), while the other three lines were resistant, as were normal cells to AOA. However, three resistant lines (but not normal cells), became sensitized to undergoing apoptosis when TRAIL was combined with AOA. TRAIL by itself had minimal effects on all cell lines and normal cells, and did not augment AOA-induced killing in the two sensitive melanoma lines. AOA plus TRAIL induced a caspase-dependent apoptotic response. AOA did not influence TRAIL DR4 or DR5 cell surface death receptor levels, but AOA enhanced pro-apoptotic protein levels of Noxa, while reducing pro-survival protein Mcl-1. To verify AOA was targeting glutamine pathway, depletion of glutamine produced similar results, because absence of glutamine sensitized three melanoma lines, but not fibroblasts to killing by TRAIL. Glutamine depletion also led to Noxa induction. These results indicate some lines are addicted to glutamine, and treatment with AOA or glutamine depletion sensitizes melanoma to TRAIL-mediated killing, while sparing normal cells. Future studies are indicated to translate these discoveries to metastatic melanoma as there is currently no treatment available to prolong survival.","title":"Targeting glutamine metabolism sensitizes melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced death.","pubmedId":"20599741"}
