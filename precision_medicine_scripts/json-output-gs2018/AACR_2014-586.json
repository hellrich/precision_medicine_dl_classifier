In this study, we investigated the role of Tip60 in glioma pathogenesis and assessed its prognostic value. Using tissue microarrays consisting of 437 cases of glioma, including 236 cases with low grade (grade I and II) and 201 cases with high grade (grade III and IV), we found that Tip60 expression was significantly reduced in high grade glioma compared to low grade glioma (P \u003d 0.004) although no significant difference in Tip60 expression was found between grade I and II, or grade III and IV glioma (P \u003e 0.05 for either). Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that reduced Tip60 expression was associated with a poorer five-year overall survival in glioma patients (P \u003d 0.015). Our data indicate that Tip60 may serve as a potential biomarker for glioma patient outcome as well as a potential therapeutic target.","title":"Prognostic significance of Tip60 expression in human glioma","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-586"}
