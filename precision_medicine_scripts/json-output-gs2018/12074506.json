Of the original 4776, we selected five controls per case matched on study, gender, and age. The pooled odds ratios (OR) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.\nEducation, weight, and body mass were not associated with MTC, but a significant positive relationship was seen with height (OR \u003d 2.6 for highest vs lowest tertile). Significant excess risks were associated with a history of thyroid nodules (OR \u003d 12), hypertension (OR \u003d 2.3), gallbladder disease (OR \u003d 4.3), and allergies (OR \u003d 2.2). Among current smokers, a decreased risk of MTC was observed with increasing number of cigarettes. The risk was significantly elevated among women having a first birth after age 25 years, but no clear pattern emerged for other reproductive factors.\nAlthough the number of MTC was small, we detected several significant associations, including prior thyroid and other diseases.","title":"Risk factors for medullary thyroid carcinoma: a pooled analysis.","pubmedId":"12074506"}
