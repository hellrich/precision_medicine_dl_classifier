In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Malchers and colleagues perform a detailed characterization of 8p12 in squamous cell lung cancer and find remarkable genomic heterogeneity in this region, raising the possibility that other genes in addition to FGFR1 may play a role in squamous cell lung cancer. Mechanistic studies of the FGFR1-amplified subset of squamous cell lung cancer reveal potential roles for fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands and MYC expression levels in modulating the response of these tumors to FGF receptor inhibition.","title":"MYCxing it up with FGFR1 in squamous cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24501305"}
