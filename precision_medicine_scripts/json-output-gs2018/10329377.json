We applied this technology to analysis of DNA from human primary cancers and found amplification of a DNA fragment in a mediastinum fibrosarcoma. PCR-based analysis of radiation hybrid panels following cloning and nucleotide sequence determination of the fragment revealed that it was derived from a region of chromosome 12q13-q15. In this region, the MDM2 and IFNG genes were noted as known genes that could be involved in human carcinogenesis. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA of the tumor revealed the amplification of the MDM2 gene together with the fragment locus, but not the IFNG gene. Our results demonstrated that detection of DNA alterations by AP-PCR fingerprinting without any previous knowledge of the genes and subsequent analysis of radiation hybrid panels could lead to easy identification of candidates for genes involved in carcinogenesis.","title":"Detection of DNA abnormalities by arbitrarily primed PCR fingerprinting: amplification of the MDM2 gene in a mediastinum fibrosarcoma.","pubmedId":"10329377"}
