However, the role of PTEN in DNA repair is controversial. Detailed studies in prostate cancer cells now indicate PTEN does not regulate RAD51 expression or homologous recombination and is not a biomarker for PARP inhibitor sensitivity.","title":"Does PTEN loss impair DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination?","pubmedId":"22179663"}
