Presentations of disease range from apparently resectable tumors with occult microscopic nodal metastases to unresectable, bulky multistation nodal disease. Controversy abounds as to the optimal treatment of the various stage IIIA subsets, which is fueled by a lack of meaningful, large randomized trials. Multimodality therapy of some type appears to be preferable in stage IIIA patients.","title":"Treatment of stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"12527580"}
