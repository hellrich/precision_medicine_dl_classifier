PLGG are histologically and clinically diverse and molecular stratification is desperately needed. BRAF-V600E mutations are highly targetable for therapy but its biological relevance and impact on PLGG outcome is unknown. Methods: We determined RAS pathway and other secondary mutations in all patients diagnosed with PLGG since 1985 (n \u003d 854), 506 had sufficient tissue. Tumors were tested for these alterations using the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR and nanostring technologies. Long term clinical data and imaging response to chemotherapy and radiation were collected on all patients. Results: BRAF-V600E mutation was observed in 19 % of PLGGs. Mutations were observed across a spectrum of histologies: pilocytic, pilomyxoid, ganglioglioma, PXA, DNET, and diffuse astrocytomas. Importantly, BRAFV600E positive cases were present in locations often not biopsied including spinal cord, brainstem and optic pathway. BRAF-mutated PLGG had poorer long-term outcome when compared with wild-type (WT) cases. For BRAF mutant vs. WT PLGG 15-year progression free (PFS) was 76% and 6412%, respectively (p \u003d 0.001) and 15-year overall survival (OS) was 5716% and 946%, respectively (p \u003d 0.0001). Progression in the V600E mutant cohort was also frequent after both chemotherapy and radiation with 10 year PFS of only 29.511% and 31.012% respectively. Specific quantitative imaging analysis revealed response to chemotherapy in only 20% of BRAF-mutant PLGG. Notably, V600E mutant PLGG had a significant worse PFS and OS when compared to NF-1 patients or those with the BRAF fusion. Secondary molecular alterations stratified BRAF mutant tumors into low and high-risk tumors (p \u003d 0.004). Conclusions: BRAF-V600E mutations identify a unique group of PLGG with distinct biology and survival. Early detection, aggressive surgery, close monitoring and targeted therapies may transform the management and outcome of these children.","title":"Relationship of BRAF V600E and associated secondary mutations on survival rate and response to conventional therapies in childhood low-grade glioma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_168561-176"}
