Thus, the mda-7 gene seems to function as a novel tumor suppressor, and there is interest in the potential of mda-7 gene transfer as cancer therapy. The objective of this study was to determine if MDA-7 protein is lost during primary melanoma progression from superficial to invasive stages and from localized to metastatic tumor. As a secondary objective, we analyzed MDA-7 protein expression in primary melanomas for correlation with predictors of outcome and with survival.\nMDA-7 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 41 primary melanomas and 41 metastases, including 24 paired samples. Each sample was scored for the percentage of positive cells and the overall intensity of immunolabeling.\nSignificant decreases in MDA-7 immunostaining, reflected in both number and intensity scores, were observed when comparing the intraepidermal and superficially invasive portions with the deeply invasive portions of primary tumors. Significant differences were also observed when comparing primary tumors to paired metastases.\nDownregulation of MDA-7 expression in primary melanomas facilitates progression to invasive and metastatic stages. These data support the development of Ad-mda7 as gene therapy for advanced melanoma.","title":"Loss of MDA-7 expression with progression of melanoma.","pubmedId":"11844832"}
