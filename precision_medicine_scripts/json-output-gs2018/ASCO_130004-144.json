Nevertheless, no biological basis for the impact of age on melanoma has been defined. In this study, we examined the impact of patient age on cellular immune response as well as response to immunotherapy treatment in the adjuvant setting in a well-studied cohort of melanoma patients.  Methods:  A prospectively-enrolled cohort of patients presenting with stage III melanoma at NYU was studied. Associations between age at diagnosis and presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), response to immunotherapy, and stage IV progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were tested by log rank test. In addition, checkpoint PD-L1 expression was tested in pre-treatment tumor specimens in a subset of patients.  Results:  316 patients (median follow-up for survivors: 45 months) were studied and categorized into two groups by age at diagnosis: 60 years (n\u003d163) and \u003e60 years (n\u003d153). The two groups were well matched by clinical substage at presentation. Patients in the older group had significantly shorter OS compared to the younger group (P\u003d0.039). TILs were absent in a significantly larger proportion of the older compared to younger group (35% versus 21%, respectively; P\u003d0.017). Among patients who received adjuvant immunotherapies (n\u003d86), patients in the older group had significantly shorter OS (P\u003d0.048), with a similar trend for PFS (P\u003d0.059). No significant survival differences were observed among patients who received non-immunotherapy treatments (n\u003d57) or no adjuvant treatment (n\u003d165). We reasoned that PD-L1 expression could explain the difference in response to immunotherapy treatment by age; however, no significant difference was observed in PD-L1 expression by age among 66 cases tested at the time of submission.  Conclusions:  Data suggest that decreased immune response and a consequent lack of response to immunotherapy might be contributing, at least in part, to the worse prognosis of older melanoma patients. PD-L1, a key inhibitory receptor, does not seem to be responsible for the observed impaired immune response. Treatment strategies for melanoma patients may need to account for biological differences by patient age.","title":"Dissecting the effect of age on immune response in melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_130004-144"}
