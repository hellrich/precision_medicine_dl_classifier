There were 23 men and 2 women, with a mean age of 70 years. The incidence of lung cancer among patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis at our hospital was 0.7 per cent, while the incidence of active pulmonary tuberculosis in untreated lung cancer patients at our hospital was 1.9 per cent. We classified the 25 cases into 2 groups as follows: (1) tuberculosis sequential to lung cancer (11 cases) and (2) tuberculosis concurrently detected with lung cancer (14 cases). All patients in the former group were transferred from other hospitals after diagnosing the coexistence of pulmonary tuberculosis during the management of lung cancer. Histological types of lung cancer were squamous cell carcinoma in 12, adenocarcinoma in 9, and small cell carcinoma in 4, and as to the disease stage, stages III to IV were predominant. Analysis on relationship of chest X-ray findings between lung cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis revealed that in general, the location of lung cancer and tuberculosis seemed to be independent. Tuberculosis in the sequential group was more extensive and severer than in the concurrent group. In the concurrent group, treatment for tuberculosis was successful except for one case, and coexisting tuberculosis did not seem to affect the course of lung cancer among this group. However, in the sequential group, 5 patients died within 3 months, 2 of them died of tuberculosis. We consider that in the management of lung cancer, physicians should consider the possibility of coexistent active pulmonary tuberculosis and should not make delay in the diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis.","title":"[Active pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with lung cancer].","pubmedId":"10599212"}
