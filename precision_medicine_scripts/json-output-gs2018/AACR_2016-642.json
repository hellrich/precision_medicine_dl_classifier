Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are thought to be more useful for predictive biomarker identification for targeted therapies, including metastatic melanoma, due to their similarities to human disease. Here, tumor biopsies from patients and ten widely-used melanoma cell lines were transplanted into immunocompromised mice to generate PDXs and CDXs, respectively. Gene expression profiles generated from the tumors of these PDXs and CDXs clustered into distinct groups, despite similar mutational signatures. Hypoxia-induced gene signatures and overexpression of the hypoxia-regulated miRNA hsa-miR-210 characterized CDXs. Inhibition of hsa-miR-210 with decoys had little phenotypic effect in vitro but resulted in reduced sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition in vivo, suggesting down-regulation of this miRNA could result in development of resistance to MEK inhibitors.","title":"Hypoxia-regulated gene expression explains differences between cell line-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenografts","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-642"}
