Glioma cells expressed immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) bearing molecules, such as Fc receptors, T cell receptor components and C-type lectins and expression was up regulated in two distinct tumor-derived prognostic signatures identified in GBM and low-grade gliomas. Targeting SYK, downstream of ITAM molecules, attenuated GBM tumor growth and invasiveness, and reduced B and CD11b+ cell mobility and infiltration resulting in improved survival. In addition, GBM tumor cells were found to display phagocytic characteristics in vitro and in vivo by flow cytometry and two photon imaging. Our data demonstrate that gliomas are hematopoietic-like tumors that express an immune signaling network important in glioma progression, and identify targets for therapeutic intervention.","title":"Glioma cells display a prognostically significant hematopoietic phenotype","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4041"}
