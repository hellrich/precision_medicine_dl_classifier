We report here a 28-year-old woman with metastatic gastric cancer overexpressing c-erbB-2 (3 + strong membrane staining on immunohistochemistry) who was treated with trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy. A complete response was obtained with a combination of trastuzumab and oxaliplatin and was maintained with trastuzumab alone for 18 months. The patient relapsed and chemotherapy (capecitabine, docetaxel) was combined with the anti-c-erbB-2 antibody. The patient survived for 4 years with metastatic disease controlled for 2 years by immunochemotherapy. We conclude that the combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy is efficient in the treatment of metastatic gastric carcinoma with overexpression of the c-erbB-2 protein.","title":"The effectiveness of trastuzumab (Herceptin) combined with chemotherapy for gastric carcinoma with overexpression of the c-erbB-2 protein.","pubmedId":"16328600"}
