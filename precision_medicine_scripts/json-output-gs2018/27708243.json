However, unsatisfactory results of recent phase III clinical trials involving lapatinib suggested biomarkers for selection of patients. The aim of this study was to identify JWA as a biomarker for lapatinib resistance in GC cells and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Lapatinib was effective to the intrinsic cisplatin-resistant GC cells. JWA activation conferred lapatinib unresponsiveness, but reversed cisplatin resistance in GC cells. Whereas, deletion of JWA significantly restored lapatinib suppression on proliferation and lapatinib-induced apoptosis. JWA-induced down-regulation of HER2 and activation of ERK phosphorylation led to lapatinib resistance. Furthermore, c-Cbl represented a novel mechanism for HER2 degradation enhanced by JWA in GC cells. Taken together, JWA is a potential predictive marker for lapatinib resistance, targeting the patients that may benefit from lapatinib treatment in human GC.","title":"JWA down-regulates HER2 expression via c-Cbl and induces lapatinib resistance in human gastric cancer cells.","pubmedId":"27708243"}
