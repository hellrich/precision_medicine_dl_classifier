To study possible genetic mechanisms underlying the development of CDDP resistance, we have adopted the approach of retroviral insertional mutagenesis. An early-stage CDDP-sensitive human melanoma cell line, WM35, was infected with a defective amphotropic murine retrovirus (murine stem cell virus), and the pooled cells were subsequently selected for CDDP-resistant variants. Nine CDDP-resistant clones independently derived from murine stem cell virus-infected WM35 cells were analyzed and it was found that five of these clones acquired an identical retroviral integration site, designated as CDDP resistance locus 1 (CRL-1), as revealed by isolation of retroviral flanking sequences. Furthermore, using the flanking sequence as probe, we have detected a 3.5-4.0-kilobase message, the expression of which is strongly increased in clones carrying a rearranged CRL-1 locus. These results strongly suggest that overexpression of CRL-1 confers resistance to CDDP in these clones. In addition, the present study indicates that retroviral insertional mutagenesis represents a potential strategy to identify genes responsible for CDDP resistance and possibly other chemotherapeutic drugs as well.","title":"Retroviral insertional mutagenesis as a strategy for the identification of genes associated with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) resistance.","pubmedId":"7867000"}
