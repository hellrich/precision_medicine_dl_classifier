The LI mean values resulted to be: CN \u003d 0.23%, NAA \u003d 0.98%, NCAA \u003d 1.79%, MIS \u003d 5.75%, IM \u003d 5.16%, MM \u003d 3.80%. In CN, NAA, NCAA and MIS, these values were calculated at epidermal level; in IM and MM at dermal level. At dermal level, the LI mean values of CN, NAA and NCAA were: 0.20%, 0.20%, 0.23% respectively. The MI mean value was close to 0 in CN, NAA, NCAA, MIS; 0.18% in IM, 0.16% in MM. Confirming a low proliferative activity in CN and a high activity in melanomas (MIS, IM, MM), the results showed that dysplastic nevi (NAA, NCAA) had a proliferative activity intermediate between common nevi and melanomas. The lesions with melanocytic atypia (NCAA) resulted to have a higher proliferative activity than those without this histological feature (NAA).","title":"Cell kinetics of melanocytes in common and dysplastic nevi and in primary and metastatic cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"1625997"}
