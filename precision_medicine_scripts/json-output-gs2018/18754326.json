The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of EGFR and c-kit in breast cancer with special focus on the basal-like phenotype (BLP) and other prognostic factors in an African population. We analyzed 65 archival tissues immunohistologically. EGFR and/or c-kit were expressed in 55% of basal-like tumors. Expression of EGFR and/or c-kit was strongly associated with high histologic grade (P\u003d0.001), high nuclear grade (P\u003d0.017), high mitotic counts (P\u003d0.002), ER negativity (P\u003d0.003), PR negativity (P\u003d0.007), and HER2 negativity (P\u003d0.014). EGFR and/or c-kit positive tumors were more likely to express the BLP (OR 9.1, CI 2.6-32.0, P\u003c0.0005) than the negative tumors. In conclusion, there is a high expression of EGFR and/or c-kit in basal-like breast carcinoma in this series from Uganda and their expression is associated with features of poor prognosis. More studies are required to assess the clinical significance of EGFR and c-kit in breast cancer patients in Uganda.","title":"Expression of EGFR and c-kit is associated with the basal-like phenotype in breast carcinomas of African women.","pubmedId":"18754326"}
