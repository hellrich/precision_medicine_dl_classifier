We developed a facile and inexpensive fluorimetric microplate assay for the quantitation of 2HG and performed an unbiased small-molecule screen in live cells to identify compounds capable of perturbing 2HG production. Zaprinast, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, was identified as an efficacious modulator of 2HG production and confirmed to lower 2HG levels in vivo. The mechanism of action was not due to cGMP stabilization, but rather, profiling of metabolites upstream of mutant IDH1 pointed to targeted inhibition of the enzyme glutaminase (GLS). Zaprinast treatment reversed histone hypermethylation and soft-agar growth of IDH1-mutant cells, and treatment of glutamine-addicted pancreatic cancer cells reduced growth and sensitized cells to oxidative damage. Thus, Zaprinast is efficacious against glutamine metabolism and further establishes the therapeutic linkages between GLS and 2HG-mediated oncogenesis.\nGain-of-function IDH mutations are common events in glioma, acute myelogenous leukemia, and other cancer types, which lead to the accumulation of the oncometabolite 2HG. We show that the drug Zaprinast is capable of reducing cellular 2HG levels by inhibiting the upstream enzyme GLS, thus identifying a new strategy to target 2HG production in selected IDH-mutant cancers.","title":"A high-throughput fluorimetric assay for 2-hydroxyglutarate identifies Zaprinast as a glutaminase inhibitor.","pubmedId":"24740997"}
