The aim of this study is to demonstrate higher detection rate of EGFR gene mutation with peptide nucleic acid (PNA) clamping compared with DS.\nThis is a single arm, prospective study for patients with stage IIIB/IV or relapsed NSCLC. Using tumor DNA from 138 patients, both DS and PNA clamping for EGFR gene in exon 18, 19, 20, and 21 were performed. Discrepant results between the two methods were verified using Cobas and a mutant enrichment based next generation sequencing (NGS). Patients with activating mutations were treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI, gefitinib, or erlotinib) as first line treatment.\nOf 138 paired test sets, 24 (17.4%) and 45 (32.6%) cases with activating mutations were detected by DS and PNA clamping, respectively. The difference of detection rate between the two methods was 15.2% (95% confidence interval, 8.7% to 17.8%; p \u003c 0.001). Between the two methods, 25 cases showed discrepant results (n\u003d23, PNA+/DS-; n\u003d2, PNA-/DS+). Mutations were confirmed by Cobas or NGS in 22 of 23 PNA+/DS- cases. The response rates to EGFR-TKI were 72.2% in the PNA+/DS+ group and 85.0% in the PNA+/DS- group.\nPNA clamping showed a significantly higher detection rate of EGFR gene mutation compared with DS. Higher sensitivity of PNA clamping was not compromised by the loss of predictive power of response to EGFR-TKI.","title":"Peptide Nucleic Acid Clamping Versus Direct Sequencing for the Detection of EGFR Gene Mutation in Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.","pubmedId":"25715768"}
