These neoplastic cells are derived from abnormal leukocytes in the bone marrow where maturation aberrations occur. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the second most common cause of leukemia cutis and the most common leukemia among adults. In the elderly population, AML presents a challenge to the medical community because of the number of preexisting comorbid conditions and the safety profile of useful chemotherapeutic agents.","title":"Leukemia cutis in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia: a case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"20184209"}
