We also evaluated the impact of transplantation on 141,441 patients with melanoma identified in cancer registries.\nThere were 336 transplant recipients (0.18%) with pretransplant melanoma; they had increased risk of melanoma-specific mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11-64, p \u003c .0001), overall mortality (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5, p \u003d .02), and incident melanoma (HR, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.9-9.8, p \u003c .0001) after transplant, compared with recipients without pretransplant melanoma. The 10-year absolute risk difference was 2.97% for melanoma-specific mortality, 3.68% for incident melanoma, and 14.32% for overall mortality. Among the 141,441 patients with melanoma in the general population, 68 (0.05%) subsequently received a transplant. Transplantation increased melanoma-specific mortality, but not significantly (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.61-4.5, p \u003d .32).\nPretransplant melanoma is associated with increased melanoma-specific mortality, overall mortality, and incident melanoma after transplant. Nonetheless, the rarity of melanoma-related events supports the current practice for listing transplant candidates with a history of melanoma.","title":"Melanoma Outcomes in Transplant Recipients With Pretransplant Melanoma.","pubmedId":"26818209"}
