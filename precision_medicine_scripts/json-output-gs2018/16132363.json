Glycyl-L: -sarcosine uptake inhibition and direct uptake studies with HeLa/PEPT1 cells [HeLa cells overexpressing oligopeptide transporter (PEPT1)] were conducted to determine PEPT1-mediated transport and compared with permeability of the prodrugs across Caco-2 monolayers.\nIsoleucyl prodrugs exhibited the highest chemical and enzymatic stability. The prodrugs enhanced the stability of the glycosidic bond of floxuridine. Thymidine phosphorylase rapidly cleaved floxuridine to 5-fluorouracil, whereas with the prodrugs no detectable glycosidic bond cleavage was observed. The 5\u0027-L: -isoleucyl and 5\u0027-L: -valyl monoester prodrugs exhibited 8- and 19-fold PEPT1-mediated uptake enhancement in HeLa/PEPT1 cells, respectively. Uptake enhancement in HeLa/PEPT1 cells correlated highly with Caco-2 permeability for all prodrugs tested. Caco-2 permeability of 5\u0027-L: -isoleucyl and 5\u0027-L: -valyl prodrugs was 8- to 11-fold greater compared with floxuridine.\nAmino acid ester prodrugs such as isoleucyl floxuridine that exhibit enhanced Caco-2 transport and slower rate of enzymatic activation to parent, and that are highly resistant to metabolism by thymidine phosphorylase may improve oral delivery and therapeutic index of floxuridine.","title":"Floxuridine amino acid ester prodrugs: enhancing Caco-2 permeability and resistance to glycosidic bond metabolism.","pubmedId":"16132363"}
