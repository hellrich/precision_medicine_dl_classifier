Thus, molecular characterization of the tumor using the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, has become a key tool for NSCLC patients treatment decision and clinical management. Methods: The performance of a custom 23 gene multiplex amplification hot spot panel, based on Ion AmpliSeq Technology, was evaluated for the analysis of tumor DNA extracted from FFPE (Formalin Fixed Parraffin Embedded) tissue. Furthermore the Ion AmpliSeq RNA Fusion Lung Cancer Research Panel was used for fusion RNA transcript analysis. Tumors mutation spectrum was determined in a cohort of 502 patients with NSCLC using the aforementioned targeted gene panels. Results: The panel used for tumor DNA analysis in this study exhibit high rates (100%) of sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility at a mutation frequency of 3%. At least one DNA mutation was detected in 374 patients (74.5%) and an RNA fusion was identified in 16 patients, (3.2%). In total, alterations in a cancer driver gene were identified (including point mutations, gene rearrangements and MET amplifications) in 77.6% of the tumors tested. Among the NSCLC patients, 13.5% (68/502) presented a mutation in a gene with approved targeted therapy (EGFR, ALK ROS1) and 9.4% had an alteration in a gene related to emerging targeted therapies according the NCCN guidelines. These alterations include ERBB2, BRAF and MET mutations, MET amplification and RET rearrangements. The remaining 51.6% of the patients had a mutation in a gene that could be related to an off label therapy or give them access to a clinical trial. Conclusions: Thus the NGS panel validated is a reliable approach of clinical applicability for tumor molecular profile detection in NSCLC patients.","title":"Molecular profiling of 502 patient cohort with NSCLC using a 27 somatic gene panel.","pubmedId":"ASCO_189381-199"}
