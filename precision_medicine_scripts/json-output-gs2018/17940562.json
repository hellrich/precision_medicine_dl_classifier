The expression of TRA16 showed no apparent difference at pathotypes and differentiation levels.\nIn this study we demonstrated an abnormal overexpression of TRA16 in NSCLC tissues. The unique expression pattern of TRA16 indicated its probable role in tumorigenesis and progression, supporting the development of TRA16 as a novel potential NSCLC marker.","title":"[Expression of TR4-associated protein in non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"17940562"}
