A composite of findings was obtained after adjudication.\nThe diagnosis was choroidal melanoma in 1,527 (99.7%) of 1,532 cases examined. Misdiagnoses were metastatic adenocarcinoma (four) and hemangioma (one). Spindle cell (9.0%), mixed cell (86.0%), and epithelioid cell (5.0%) types were observed. Medium tumors were located more posteriorly than large tumors. Considerable local invasion was seen: rupture of Bruch\u0027s membrane (87.7%), invasion of the retina (49.1%), tumor cells in the vitreous (25.2%), vortex vein invasion (8.9%), invasion of tumor vessels by tumor cells (13.8%), and invasion into emissary canals (55.0%). Overall, 81.1% demonstrated local invasion, excluding rupture of Bruch\u0027s membrane. Scleral invasion was present in 55.7% of eyes, and extrascleral extension was present in 8.2%. Mitotic activity was significantly reduced in eyes that had received preenucleation radiation treatment (P \u003c .001). The number of macrophages in the tumor increased with increased pigmentation (P \u003c .001) and increased necrosis (P \u003c .01).\nThe accuracy of diagnosis in the COMS is high, with histopathologic confirmation of the diagnosis at 99.7%. Extensive local invasion of the tumor was seen. Preenucleation irradiation significantly reduced the number of mitotic figures. An association was found regarding the presence of macrophages, the level of pigmentation, and degree of necrosis.","title":"Histopathologic characteristics of uveal melanomas in eyes enucleated from the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study.
