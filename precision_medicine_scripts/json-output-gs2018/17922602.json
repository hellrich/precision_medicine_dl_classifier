The infiltrating growth pattern and likelihood of vascular and perineural involvement distinguishes basal cell adenocarcinoma from basal cell adenoma. Other diagnostic considerations include adenoid cystic carcinoma and basaloid squamous carcinoma. Basal cell adenocarcinomas show strong immunoreactivity to cytokeratin 7 and variable myoepithelial staining with S100. It is necessary to differentiate basal cell adenocarcinoma from other basaloid cell tumors of the minor salivary glands because of the prognosis and potential differences in treatment, particularly adenoid cystic adenocarcinoma and basaloid squamous carcinoma. Surgical excision with a wide margin to ensure complete removal has been suggested as the primary treatment for basal cell adenocarcinoma. Radiotherapy has been proposed for lesions in the minor salivary glands because of the higher likelihood of vascular and neural invasion and for those that are diffusely infiltrative.","title":"Basal cell adenocarcinoma of minor salivary glands.","pubmedId":"17922602"}
