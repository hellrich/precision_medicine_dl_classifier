Preoperatively, markedly elevated levels of serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were noted. After complete excision of the tumor, serum levels of LDH returned to normal levels. Only five other cases of dysgerminoma with elevated serum LDH have been reported. In each case, as in the present one, LDH levels were significantly higher than in any other ovarian tumor. LDH can be considered as an enzymatic tumor marker of ovarian dysgerminoma, for diagnosis, prognosis, and surveillance.","title":"Serum lactic dehydrogenase: a tumor marker of ovarian dysgerminoma in a female pseudohermaphrodite.","pubmedId":"6469085"}
