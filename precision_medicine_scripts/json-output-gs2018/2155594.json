We pointed out: 1. From 1972 to 1985 the mortality of lung cancer in males dropped from 6,023 per year to 5,213, while that of females increased from 698 to 959. 2. In the time from 1971 to 1983 the over-all incidence (crude rates) of lung cancer in males decreased from 87.1 per 100,000 to 75.5 per 100,000, but came up to 77.2 per 100,000 in 1984. The females rose from 9.7 to 12.3 per 100,000 in the same interval. 3. The age related incidences showed different courses not regarding the different levels of both sexes. In the age group of 30-59 we found a significant incidence rise. The incidence of the 60-69 year old males dropped in a range of 10%; that of the females with the same age had an undulating course with rising trend. Males and females of an age of 70 years and older also had an undulating course with increasing trend. 4. Between 1970 and 1979 the proportions of histological types moved. The adenocarcinomas of males rose significantly from 10.0 to 12.6% and that of large cell carcinomas from 3.6 to 6.0%. In the females the proportions of large cell cancers rose also from 4.2 to 7.5%. 5. The histological types of lung cancer have a significant age relation: Undifferentiated cancers and adenocarcinomas decrease with the age while proportions of squamous cell cancers rise with the age. 6. During 1960 to 1969 the market share of filter cigarettes changed from less than 10% to 79% and rose to 91% until 1975. In the same time the cigarette consumption per head of population increased continuously until now (1984: consumption of cigarettes per head 1,845). 7. In the age group of 18-25 the proportions of smokers is 50% and their middle consumption of cigarettes per day amounts to 11 cigarettes. In the age group of 45-55 the proportion of smokers runs to 34% and their cigarette consumption per day comes to 15 cigarettes. The proportion of male smokers amounts to 47%. The proportion of female smokers amounts to 18%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","title":"[Lung cancer in the DDR with special reference to histological types and cigarette consumption].","pubmedId":"2155594"}
