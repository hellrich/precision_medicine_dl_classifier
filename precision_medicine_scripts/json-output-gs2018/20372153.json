Three patients were treated with imatinib and one with sorafenib. All four patients responded to treatment, but three have since progressed within the brain.\nThe observed clinical responses support further investigation of KIT inhibitors in metastatic melanoma, selected according to KIT mutation status.","title":"Clinical responses observed with imatinib or sorafenib in melanoma patients expressing mutations in KIT.","pubmedId":"20372153"}
