In AML, two types of mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) have been described; internal tandem duplications (ITD) and point mutations at aspartic acid residue 835 (D835). We analysed 24 myeloid sarcoma specimens from 20 patients for FLT3 ITD and D835 mutations. FLT3 ITD mutations were identified in three of 20 cases (15%); no D835 mutations were identified. The ITD inserts ranged in size from 33 to 198 base pairs (bp) and represented approximately 20-40% of the FLT3 alleles. Two cases showed discordance in FLT3 ITD mutational status. In one case, the leukaemia specimen was positive for a FLT3 ITD mutation and the myeloid sarcoma specimen was negative. In the second case, the myeloid sarcoma was positive for a FLT3 ITD mutation at diagnosis, but negative in subsequent relapse samples. Our findings suggest that small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 may be useful therapeutic agents for treatment of myeloid sarcomas-containing FLT3 mutations, however, the potential for discordance between the leukaemia and myeloid sarcoma, necessitates that the myeloid sarcoma tumour itself be analysed for FLT3 mutations.","title":"FLT3 mutations in myeloid sarcoma.","pubmedId":"15352981"}
