The pattern of expression for all markers varied according to tumor histologic type and cellular localization. Cytoplasmic expression scores were significantly higher in tumors than in normal epithelia. Nuclear bFGF (P \u003d 0.03) and FGFR1 (P \u003d 0.02) levels were significantly higher in women than in men. Although cytoplasmic FGFR1 expression was significantly higher (P \u003d 0.002) in ever smokers than in never smokers, nuclear FGFR1 (P \u003d 0.0001) and FGFR2 (P \u003d 0.003) expression was significantly higher in never smokers. Different prognostic patterns for the expression of these markers were detected for both NSCLC histologic types. Dysplastic changes showed significantly higher expression of all markers compared with squamous metaplasia.\nbFGF, FGFR1, and FGFR2 are frequently overexpressed in SCC and adenocarcinoma of the lung. bFGF signaling pathway activation may be an early phenomenon in the pathogenesis of SCC and thus an attractive novel target for lung cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic strategies.","title":"Immunohistochemical expression of basic fibroblast growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 and 2 in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"18829480"}
