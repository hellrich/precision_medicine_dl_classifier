So far, late side effects of 2 courses of PEB (cisplatin 20 mg/m d1-5, etoposide 100 mg/m2 d1-5 and bleomycin 30 mg d 2,9,15) have been poorly documented. Methods: We compared cholesterol (CHOL), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), serum creatinine (CREA), uric acid (UA), magnesium (MG), testosterone (T), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), vital capacity (VC), diffusion capacity (TLCO), and hearing loss (db) in V+ and V- pts, wherein we also formed two age groups (35 and \u003e35). For each parameter we applied two different two sample tests: Welch Two Sample t-test and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Results: Only pts 24 mos after orchiectomy were considered for late toxicity (LT) evaluation, 93 V- and 87 V+ pts. Median follow-up was 67 mos (6-253). Only variable numbers of pts were available for each toxicity evaluation, ranging from 54 to 10 pts per parameter and group. TG levels were significantly (sig) higher in the V+/ \u003e35 yrs group whereas T levels in the V+/\u003e35 yrs group were sig lower than in the control group (V-/\u003e35 yrs). All other serum parameters, lung function and audiometry did not show any statistically sig differences. As for second malignancies, 1 V+ patient died of non small cell lung cancer 34 mos after orchiectomy. In the V- group 2 pts died, 1 of hepatocellular carcinoma and another of a desmoid tumor of the retroperitoneum 69 and 89 mos after orchiectomy, respectively. Detailed results will be presented. Conclusions: With 2 cycles of PEB late toxicity is rare. The true clinical impact of higher TG and lower T levels in pts \u003e35 yrs is unknown.","title":"Late toxicity of two cycles PEB (cisplatin, etoposide, bleomycin) in the management of clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) of the testis: 20-year experience of the vienna testicular tumor study group (VTTSG).","pubmedId":"ASCO_20276-64"}
