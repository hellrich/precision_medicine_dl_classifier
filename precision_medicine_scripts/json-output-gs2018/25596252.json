Targeted anti-HER2 therapy with trastuzumab has been recently validated in advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer treatment. A standardized modified scoring system was recently introduced for gastroesophageal HER2 scoring. We aimed to validate this scoring system, including an analysis of interobserver variability of immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring.\nIn total, 323 patients with histologically confirmed invasive gastric or esophageal adenocarcinoma were examined for HER2 by IHC and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). IHC 3 + or IHC 2 +/CISH positive tumors were considered HER2 positive. Interobserver variability on IHC scoring using the currently standard modified HER2 scoring system was determined among three clinical pathologists. Clinicopathologic characteristics were retrospectively retrieved from the patient records.\nHER2 positivity was found in 50 (15.5%) of 323 patients. Interobserver agreement on IHC scoring was high (Îº \u003d 0.78). Most disagreement was found in diffuse or mixed tumor types and in weak to moderate stained samples (IHC 2 +). The HER2 IHC scoring system is sensitive in differentiating HER2 status before ISH.\nThe currently used standardized HER2 scoring system is an excellent, clinically applicable method to establish HER2 status in appropriately educated and trained pathologists.","title":"Pathologic diagnostics of HER2 positivity in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25596252"}
