Quality indicators need to be identified to ensure optimal care. Hospitals could assess their melanoma care through feedback mechanisms from the National Cancer Data Base and can better direct quality improvement efforts. The American College of Surgeons, based on a landmark publication (Bilimoria 2009) found 3 quality measures regarding minimum number of resected lymph nodes from lymphadenectomy that must be pathologically documented and examined. They set minimum nodes for cervical (15), axillary (10), and inguinal (5) areas. Based on hospital level assessment and compliance of at least 90% of patients meeting the minimum, \u003c 25% of US hospitals met the criteria. The objective of this study was to evaluate adequate nodal evaluation for melanoma in a single institution and identify compliance after a quality improvement project. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all patients that underwent lymphadenectomy due to diagnosis of melanoma from October 1999 to October 2015 was performed. Each chart was evaluated and the surgical pathology report used to determine how many lymph nodes were documented by the pathologist according to the lymph node basin. These were evaluated for variability and compliance with the minimums established by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Cancer before and after a quality improvement project was implemented by the Penn State Skin Oncology Program. Results: In the studied period 88% of cervical, 87% of axillary and 98% of inguinal lymphadenectomies met the minimum number of lymph nodes resected and examined. However, after the implementation of the quality improvement project the compliance to these minimums has risen to 100%, 94.2% and 100% respectively. Conclusions: With valid quality measures by using a formal, well-described methodology by ACS, we substantially reduced the variation in the quality of melanoma care delivered in our institution. Hospitals can use these indicators to direct quality improvement efforts, which thus offers an opportunity to standardize and improve the quality of care in patients with melanoma.","title":"Assessment of practice patterns and quality indicators for lymphadenectomy in melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_169281-176"}
