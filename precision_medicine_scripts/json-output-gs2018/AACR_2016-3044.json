Hallmark characteristics include slow growth rate, peri-neural tumor spread, and a high propensity for late distant metastasis. Surgery and radiation are the mainstays of treatment with no effective systemic agents to date. Due to infrequency, studies of novel therapeutics are not routinely feasible. In addition, whether these tumors can be sensitized to radiation by concurrent chemotherapy is not known. We report here the establishment and examination of ACC patient derived xenografts (PDX) to investigate the efficacy of novel chemotherapies and combinations of chemotherapy and radiation.Methods: PDXs have been established and maintained in NOD-SCID gamma (NSG) mice from both research biopsies and surgical specimens. Common cancer-associated mutations in both the primary patient tumor and PDX were identified using the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon Cancer panel. Well described immunohistochemical markers of ACC were used to compare histological characteristics between the primary tumor and PDX. The ACC PDX was engrafted into the flanks of nude mice and treated with focal radiotherapy (5 Gy x 8 fractions delivered twice weekly), a panel of chemotherapeutic agents, or combination radiochemotherapy. Tumor size was measured over time and comparisons between treatment groups made by the extra-sum-of-squares f test.Results: PDXs established from ACC maintain the histologic and physical characteristics of the primary tumor. Targeted mutational analysis of ACC identified expected alterations based on previously reported large scale sequencing of other human tumors including mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinases(RTKs) cKit and KDR/VEGFR2. Based on identified tumor mutations, several targeted therapies were selected including dovitinib, a multi-RTK inhibitor, BEZ235, a PI3K/mTORC inhibitor, and cetuximab, an EGFR mAB. Treatment with each of these compounds showed varying degrees of growth inhibition without evidence of frank tumor regression. However, combining these drugs with radiation demonstrated significantly improved tumor control in comparison to drug alone.Conclusions: Studies using our PDX model suggest that several molecular targeting agents can significantly augment the impact of radiation on ACC tumor growth. These preliminary data identify the rationale to investigate selected molecular drug/radiation combinations for ACC, particularly when driven by tumor specific genetic biomarkers. Expansion of these ACC studies may be valuable to advance the design of new investigational treatment strategies for this challenging tumor.","title":"Patient-derived adenoid cystic carcinoma xenografts to study molecular target modulation of tumor radiosensitivity","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3044"}
