The expression of CD133, a stem-like cell marker expressed in the glioma cells, is believed to lead to tumorigenesis in the human brain. Thus, it is necessary to find a proper method to specifically kill the CD133(+) glioma cells. Dendritic cell (DC)/tumor hybrids are proven to be able to induce an effective immune response, leading to killing of glioma cells in vitro. We isolated CD133(+) cells from a population of primary glioma cells, and cultured autologous DCs and T cells at the same time. Next, we electrofused the DCs with the CD133(+) glioma cells and with CD133- ones, in order to explore a new strategy for glioma therapy. We then exposed the T cells to five separate groups of cells: DC/CD133(+) hybrids, DC/CD133(-) hybrids, DCs alone, unsorted glioma cells alone and mixed DCs-glioma cells. A cytotoxicity assay showed that T cells stimulated by either type of hybrid were able to kill cultured autologous glioma cells significantly more effectively than those stimulated by the other three cell types (P\u003c0.05). The amounts of IFN-γ secreted by T cells stimulated by the two types of fused cells were obviously increased compared to those stimulated by the other three cell types (P\u003c0.05). However, no significant differences were noted between the effects of the two hybrids, neither in the cytotoxicity assay nor in the IFN-γ release assay (P\u003e0.05). Therefore, both DC/CD133(+) and DC/CD133(-) hybrids can cause significant T cell immune responses in vitro. There were no significant differences between the immune responses caused by the two types of hybrids.","title":"Anti-glioma response of autologous T cells stimulated by autologous dendritic cells electrofused with CD133+ or CD133- glioma cells.","pubmedId":"22123613"}
