Patients were eligible regardless of FLT3 mutation status. Trough blood samples for pharmacokinetics were obtained on days 8, 15, and 21 before midostaurin dosing.\nSeventeen patients with a median age of 73 (range, 57-83) years were enrolled; 5 patients had previous conventional treatment and none of the patients had FLT3 mutations. Dose-limiting toxicities were not observed. Hospitalizations, primarily for infections, occurred in one-third of treatment cycles. Fourteen patients were evaluable for response: 3 attained complete remission and 2 had hematologic improvement. Median (range) survival from enrollment was 6 (1 to ≥ 19) months. Three patients died within 60 days of enrollment (2 progressive disease, 1 non-dose-limiting toxicity, treatment-related). Pharmacokinetic data at 75 mg orally b.i.d. showed increased trough levels of midostaurin during cycle 2 compared with cycle 1 and persistent and increasing levels of its active metabolite, CGP52421.\nThe combination of sequential azacitidine and midostaurin is safe and tolerable with response rates comparable with azacitidine alone and should be studied further in FLT3 mutation-positive AML.","title":"A phase I study of midostaurin and azacitidine in relapsed and elderly AML patients.","pubmedId":"25776192"}
