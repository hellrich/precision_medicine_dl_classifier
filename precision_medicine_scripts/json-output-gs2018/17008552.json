However, resistance to imatinib develops frequently, particularly in late-stage disease. To identify new cellular BCR-ABL downstream targets, we analyzed differences in global protein expression in BCR-ABL-positive K562 cells treated with or without imatinib in vitro. Among the 19 proteins found to be differentially expressed, we detected the down-regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), a protein essential for cell proliferation. eIF5A represents the only known eukaryotic protein activated by posttranslational hypusination. Hypusination inhibitors (HIs) alone exerted an antiproliferative effect on BCR-ABL-positive and -negative leukemia cell lines in vitro. However, the synergistic dose-response relationship found for the combination of imatinib and HI was restricted to Bcr-Abl-positive cells. Furthermore, this synergistic effect was confirmed by cytotoxicity assays, cell-cycle analysis, and CFSE labeling of primary CD34+ CML cells. Specificity of this effect could be demonstrated by cotreatment of K562 cells with imatinib and siRNA against eIF5. In conclusion, through a comparative proteomics approach and further functional analysis, we identified the inhibition of eIF5A hypusination as a promising new approach for combination therapy in BCR-ABL-positive leukemias.","title":"Hypusination of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A): a novel therapeutic target in BCR-ABL-positive leukemias identified by a proteomics approach.","pubmedId":"17008552"}
