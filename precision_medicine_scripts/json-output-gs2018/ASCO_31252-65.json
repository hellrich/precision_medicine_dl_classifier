Approximately 50% of patients will develop metastases and the mean survival of those with liver metastases is 8-10 months. There are no effective systemic therapies. Pre-clinical studies of the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory agent, lenalidomide, have shown promise in animal models of human ocular melanoma. We therefore conducted a phase II trial comparing two doses of oral lenalidomide. Methods: Patients with stage IV ocular melanoma, who met eligibility criteria and demonstrated disease progression, were enrolled on an IRB approved prospective random assignment trial comparing 5 mg and 25 mg of lenalidomide administered once a day orally for 21 days with a 7 day recovery (one cycle). Lesions were measured at baseline and every 3 months and scored for response by RECIST criteria. Patients who completed 3 cycles were eligible for response evaluation. Patients with responding lesions or with stable disease could continue receiving the agent. Toxicity was assessed using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. Results: Seventeen patients (13 female, 4 male; mean age 53) met eligibility criteria and were randomized to 5 mg (9 patients) or 25 mg (8 patients) of lenalidomide. The agent was well tolerated at both doses with only three grade 3 toxicities (two decreased ANC and one rash/puritis) requiring dose adjustments. Sixteen patients were eligible for response assessments. Nine patients had progressive disease by RECIST criteria following 3 cycles of therapy. Seven patients (44%) had stable disease for a mean of 7 months (range 6-12 months). There were no RECIST defined responders. There were no differences between the two dose groups with respect to toxicity or disease stabilization. Conclusions: Lenalidomide is well tolerated at doses of 5 mg and 25 mg orally for a 21 day cycle by patients with stage IV ocular melanoma. While no responses were seen, disease stabilization for a mean of 7 months was seen in 44% of patients. This effect was consistent with the pre-clinical animal data. Based on these results, further development of lenalidomide in combination with other agents should be considered for the treatment of metastatic ocular melanoma.","title":"A randomized phase II trial comparing two doses of lenalidomide for the treatment of stage IV ocular melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_31252-65"}
