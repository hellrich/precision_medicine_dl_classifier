The Spitz nevi may be misdiagnosed as malignant melanoma and vice versa. Therefore, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) was used for a possible discrimination between Spitz nevi and malignant melanomas on the basis of numerical aberrations of the chromosome complement in interphase nuclei of thin sections. Previous studies had shown changes in malignant melanomas which were not found at the same level in normal tissue or benign tumors. Thin sections of archival paraffin material from 42 Spitz nevi with different histological type and grade of anomaly were subjected to FISH-analyses using commercially available biotinylated and/or digoxigenated alphoid DNA probes of chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 9, 17 and 18, which were applied in combinations in a two- or three-color-FISH. Unaffected epithelial areas from the same sections served as. The obtained data were compared with those collected previously from thin sections of malignant melanomas prepared in the same way. Due to the sometimes limited nevus area investigated, the number of evaluable nuclei was lower than expected from previous experiences with malignant melanomas. Therefore, only 20 nevi could be reliably evaluated. The comparison of the group of Spitz nevi with the group of controls did not show any significant difference regarding chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 9 and 17 (Wilcoxon test). The method used to detect chromosomal loss or gain in the individual Spitz nevi demonstrated only two nevi (one of the spindle cell type with a low to middle grade of anomaly, the other of the epitheloid cell type with a middle grade of anomaly) with a gain of chromosome 7 and chromosome 17, respectively. So, with respect to the histological type and grade of anomaly, no numerical aberrations could be detected in Spitz nevi. The comparison of the group of Spitz nevi with subgroups of malignant melanomas (metastatic, non-metastatic, melanomas with a thickness \u003c1.5 mm and melanomas with a thickness \u003e2. 0 mm) and with the whole group of malignant melanomas showed significant differences concerning chromosome 9 (Mann-Whitney U test), signal indices, which were higher in the melanomas than in the Spitz nevi. Regarding chromosomes 6, 7 and 17 no significant differences could be shown, although a trend of gain in melanomas and of loss in Spitz nevi was observed of these chromosomes.","title":"Differentiation between Spitz nevi and malignant melanomas by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization.","pubmedId":"10339676"}
