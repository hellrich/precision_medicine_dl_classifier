Here, we tested whether these factors could also affect aberrant DNA methylation. DNAs from 44 fresh tumor tissues and 19 non-tumor adjacent normal tissues, obtained from 44 patients affected by SCC of esophagus (SCCE), were studied for methylation at the CDKN2A/p16 gene promoter by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay. Statistical methods were used to assess association of promoter methylation with biopathological, clinical, and personal information data, including obesity and airborne exposures. Methylation at the CDKN2A/p16 gene promoter was detected in 12 out of 44 tumor samples. None of the non-tumor tissues exhibited the aberrant methylation. Our results confirmed previously described significant association with low tumor stage (P\u003d 0.002); in addition, we found that obesity (P\u003d 0.001) and occupational exposure (P\u003d 0.008) were both significantly associated with CDKN2A/p16 promoter methylation. This study provides evidence that obesity and occupational exposure increase the risk of developing esophageal cancer through an enhancement of CDKN2A/p16 promoter methylation.","title":"Associations of risk factors obesity and occupational airborne exposures with CDKN2A/p16 aberrant DNA methylation in esophageal cancer patients.","pubmedId":"20459442"}
