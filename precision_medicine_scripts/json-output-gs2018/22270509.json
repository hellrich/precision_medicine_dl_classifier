WBMTV and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) were measured in all malignant lesions. The Cox proportional hazards model was used with age, sex, performance status, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), treatment, stage, SUV(max) and WBMTV to predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Subgroup analysis was performed using WBMTV combined with conventional staging and tumour node metastasis (TNM) staging.\nThe uni- and multivariate analyses showed that both stage and WBMTV were independent prognostic factors for death and progression. Patients with high WBMTV were associated with poor prognosis compared with patients with low WBMTV [hazard ratio \u003d 2.11 (95% confidence interval 1.31-3.39) for death (p \u003d 0.002) and 1.80 (95% confidence interval 1.16-2.80) for progression (p \u003d 0.009)]. Incorporation of conventional staging and WBMTV could classify four subgroups with different prognoses (log-rank test, p \u003c 0.001). Incorporation of TNM staging and WBMTV could classify six subgroups with different prognoses (log-rank test, p \u003c 0.001).\nWBMTV is an independent predictor for progression and death in patients with SCLC. Incorporation of WBMTV with TNM staging can provide a more detailed prediction of prognosis than WBMTV with conventional staging as well as tumour staging alone.","title":"Whole-body metabolic tumour volume of 18F-FDG PET/CT improves the prediction of prognosis in small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22270509"}
