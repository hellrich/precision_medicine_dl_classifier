ALCL is frequently associated with a NPM/ALK fusion gene which is found in up to 75% of pediatric ALCLs. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RQ-RT-PCR) of NPM/ALK and CD30 gene expression was employed to analyze minimal residual disease (MRD) in 10 patients with NPM/ALK positive ALCL in 79 follow-up bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) samples. In all BM samples from relapses and/or closely before a relapse, BM samples revealed NPM/ALK and CD30 positivity in at least one of the iliac BM trephines. Five out of nine relapses were preceded or were accompanied by minimally half log increased NPM/ALK levels in the BM. We found that RQ-RT-PCR of the CD30 expression is not suitable for MRD detection--only two relapses were accompanied by an increase of the CD30 level above a level which was detected in BM/PB samples from healthy individuals. RQ-RT-PCR of NPM/ALK expression is a promising and rapid approach for monitoring MRD.","title":"Quantitative PCR detection of NPM/ALK fusion gene and CD30 gene expression in patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma--residual disease monitoring and a correlation with the disease status.","pubmedId":"17320171"}
