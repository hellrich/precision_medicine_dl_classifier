A total of 1018 biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis C patients were enrolled for evaluation. The proportions of PNPLA3 rs738409 GG genotype carriage were 7.8% (44/563), 15.8% (58/367) and 19.3% (17/88) in patients with no (liver fat content \u003c 5%), mild (5-33%) and moderate/severe (\u003e 66%) hepatic steatosis, respectively (trend P \u003c 0.001). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that the strongest factor independently associated with steatosis was the carriage of the PNPLA3 rs738409 GG genotype (odds ratio [OR]/95% confidence intervals [CI]:2.34/1.557-3.515, P \u003c 0.001). Among the patients with BMI \u003c 24 kg/m(2), carriage of the rs738409 GG genotype was the only factor associated with hepatic steatosis (OR/CI:3.44/1.824-6.500, P \u003c 0.001). PNPLA3 genetic variants had minimal effects on hepatic steatosis among overweight or obese patients. Compared to patients with BMI \u003c 24 kg/m(2)/non-GG genotype, those with BMI \u003e24 kg/m(2)/GG genotype were more likely to have hepatic steatosis (OR/CI:3.87/2.292-6.524, P \u003c 0.001). In conclusions, both PNPLA3 genetic variants and BMI played important roles in hepatic steatosis among Asian chronic hepatitis C patients. However, the genetic effect was mainly restricted to non-obese patients.","title":"PNPLA3 genetic variants determine hepatic steatosis in non-obese chronic hepatitis C patients.","pubmedId":"26139292"}
