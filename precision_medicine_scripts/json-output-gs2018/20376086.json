We studied the prevalence and clinical implications of IDH1 genomic alterations in pediatric and adult AML. Diagnostic DNA from 531 AML patients treated on Children\u0027s Oncology Group trial COG-AAML03P1 (N\u003d257), and Southwest Oncology Group trials SWOG-9031, SWOG-9333 and SWOG-9500 (N\u003d274), were tested for IDH1 mutations. Codon R132 mutations were absent in the pediatric cohort, but were found in 12 of 274 adult patients (4.4%, 95% CI 2.3-7.5). IDH1(R132) mutations occurred most commonly in patients with normal karyotype, and those with FLT3/ITD and NPMc mutations. Patients with IDH1(R132) mutations trended toward higher median diagnostic white blood cell counts (59.2 x 10(9) vs 29.1 x 10(9) per liter, P\u003d0.19) than those without mutations, but the two groups did not differ significantly in age, bone marrow blast percentage, overall survival or relapse-free survival. Eleven patients (2.1%) harbored a novel V71I sequence alteration, which was found to be a germ-line polymorphism. IDH1 mutations were not detected in pediatric AML, and are uncommon in adult AML.","title":"Molecular alterations of the IDH1 gene in AML: a Children\u0027s Oncology Group and Southwest Oncology Group study.","pubmedId":"20376086"}
