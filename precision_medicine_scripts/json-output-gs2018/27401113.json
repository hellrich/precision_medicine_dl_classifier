It is associated with the loss of thyroid iodide-metabolizing genes, such as sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), and therefore with radioiodine refractoriness. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, constitutively activated by BRAFV600E, is not always efficient in resistant tumors suggesting that other compensatory mechanisms contribute to a BRAFV600E adaptive resistance. Recent studies pointed to a key role of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in BRAFV600E-induced effects. The reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating NADPH oxidase NOX4, which is increased in PTC, has been identified as a new key effector of TGF-β in cancer, suggestive of a potential role in BRAFV600E-induced thyroid tumors.\nHere, using two human BRAFV600E-mutated thyroid cell lines and a rat thyroid cell line expressing BRAFV600E in a conditional manner, we show that NOX4 upregulation is controlled at the transcriptional level by the oncogene via the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway. Importantly, treatment of cells with NOX4-targeted siRNA downregulates BRAFV600E-induced NIS repression.\nOur results establish a link between BRAFV600E and NOX4, which is confirmed by a comparative analysis of NOX4 expression in human (TCGA) and mouse thyroid cancers. Remarkably, analysis of human and murine BRAFV600E-mutated thyroid tumors highlights that the level of NOX4 expression is inversely correlated to thyroid differentiation suggesting that other genes involved in thyroid differentiation in addition to NIS might be silenced by a mechanism controlled by NOX4-derived ROS. This study opens a new opportunity to optimize thyroid cancer therapy. Antioxid.
