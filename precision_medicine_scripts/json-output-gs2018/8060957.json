The first primary tumor was a malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the left lower eyelid aggressively invading the nasogenian region, bulbar conjunctiva, episclera, and the cornea over a 36-year follow-up period. The second primary cancer was an unsuspected choroidal malignant melanoma unexpectedly found at histology. The possible correlations between these two malignancies are discussed.","title":"Two different primary ophthalmic cancers in a 39-year-old female patient.","pubmedId":"8060957"}
