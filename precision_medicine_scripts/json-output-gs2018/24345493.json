ROS1 rearrangement defines a new molecular subset of NSCLC with the prevalence of ROS1 rearrangements around 1%-2%. ROS1-positive NSCLCs arise in young never-smokers with adenocarcinoma that are similar to those observed in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Crizotinib demonstrates in vitro activity and early clinical trial shows marked antitumor activity in ROS1-rearranged patients. The overall response rate is around 56% and the disease control rate at 8 weeks is about 76%. Further understanding the ROS1 fusions in the pathogenesis of NSCLC, methods to detect ROS1 rearrangements, and targeting ROS1-rearranged NSCLC patients with specific kinase inhibitors would lead to an era of personalized medicine. \n最近研究显示，包括非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）在内的许多恶性肿瘤存在ROS1受体酪氨酸激酶基因重排。ROS1基因重排作为一种新发现的NSCLC亚型，其发生率约占NSCLC的1%-2%，优势人群通常为年轻、不吸烟的肺腺癌患者，这些临床特征与ALK重排的NSCLC患者类似。体外实验和早期临床试验均显示，克唑替尼对ROS1重排阳性的癌症患者具有明显的抗肿瘤活性，治疗第8周和第16周时疾病控制率分别为76%和60%，治疗患者的总缓解率为56%。进一步了解ROS1基因重排在NSCLC发病中的作用，提高ROS1基因重排的检测技术，发现ROS1重排患者及研发特异性ROS1激酶抑制剂将为肿瘤个体化治疗增添新的篇章。","title":"[Clinical significance of ROS1 rearrangements in non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"24345493"}
