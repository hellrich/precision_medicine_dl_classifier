In this study, we investigate how CHK1 participates to proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing the mutated FLT3-ITD tyrosine kinase receptor. Pharmacological inhibition of CHK1 as well as its shRNA mediated down regulation reduced the proliferation rate of FLT-ITD expressing leukemic cell lines in a cytostatic manner. Flow cytometry analysis revealed no accumulation in a specific phase of the cell cycle upon CHK1 inhibition. Accordingly, lentiviral-mediated CHK1 overexpression increased the proliferation rate of FLT3-ITD expressing cells, as judged by cell viability and [3H] thymidine incorporation experiments. By contrast, expression of a ser280 mutant did not, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue is an important determinant of CHK1 proliferative function. Clonogenic growth of primary leukemic cells from patients in semi-solid medium was reduced upon CHK1 inhibition, confirming the data obtained with leukemic established cell lines. Surprisingly, 3 out of 4 CHK1 inhibitory compounds tested in this study were also potent inhibitors of the FLT3-ITD tyrosine kinase receptor. Altogether, these data identify CHK1 as a regulator of FLT3-ITD-positive leukemic cells proliferation, and they open interesting perspectives in terms of new therapeutic strategies for these pathologies.
