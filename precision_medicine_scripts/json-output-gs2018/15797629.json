We showed predominant overexpression of CCND2 and CDK4 compared to CCND1/D3 and CDK6 respectively. We found a specific correlation between relapse and CDK4 overexpression, but not CDK6 overexpression. We did not identify any methylation of the p16(INK4a) promoter. This suggests that dysregulation of CCND2 and CDK4 plays a specific role in WT tumorigenesis.","title":"Frequent overexpression of cyclin D2/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 in Wilms\u0027 tumor.","pubmedId":"15797629"}
