We wanted to determine the predictors of response to therapy with the KIT inhibitor sunitinib. Methods: We screened tumors for KIT aberrations using sequencing of exons 9, 11, 13, 17, and 18, FISH analysis, and immunohistochemistry for CD117. Patients with KIT mutations, amplification \u003e 1.5, or CD117 staining 2+ in over 50% of cells were eligible for therapy with sunitinib 50mg/day 4 weeks on 2 off, and responses were evaluated using RECIST criteria. Results: See Table. Six patients had KIT mutations; five in exon 11 and one in exon 13. All were wild type for BRAF, NRAS, and GNAQ. Two also had KIT copy number increase determined by FISH. Three could be started on treatment. One patient with mucosal melanoma and KIT mutation exon 11 W557G had a partial response lasting for 7 months, one progressed, and one was non- evaluable. Of the 11 patients who had KIT copy number increase without mutations three were treated: one had a transient partial response lasting three months and two had progressive disease. Two patients without mutations or amplification that were CD 117 positive were treated and one had a partial response. Conclusions: At this early point in the trial, KIT mutations may indicate sensitivity to sunitinib.
