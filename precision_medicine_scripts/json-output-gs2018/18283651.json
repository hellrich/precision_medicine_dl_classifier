Sex ratio was 3,4. Since 1971 lung cancer is the most frequent cancer in males: in 2004 - 25,2% of total male cancers, in female there are less frequently - 7,8% total cancers and took third place after breast cancer - 20,5% and colorectal cancer - 10,4%. Incidence rate of lung cancer in males peaked in 1996 - 89,1/10(5) and then stabilized or event slightly decreased while corresponding rates in women steadily increased in whole period 1970-2004. The incidence of lung cancer for both men and women showed an increase with age and reached peak both in elderly men and women (age group 70-79) respectively - 516,9/105 in males and 81,2/10(5) in females. Median age of registered cases was as men as women in age group 60-69. In the reviewed period of time crude rate of incidence increased in men - 231,5% in women - 390% while standardized rates increased less - 172% in men and 282% in women. There were 16 565 deaths due lung cancer in men - crude rate 89,6/10(5) and 4641 deaths in women, crude rate - 23,6/10(5). Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men - 32,3% of all cancer deaths and took second position in women - 12,2% (after breast cancer - 12,9%) of total cancers deaths in women. In the analyzed periods of time - trend mortality was similar as times - trends incidence lung cancer. Both incidence and mortality lung cancer varies by regions: incidence in males from 73,2 to 109,9; in females from 14,5 to 33,8; mortality: in males from 73,9 to 99,8; in females from 13,0 to 30,9.\nLung cancer incidence and mortality rate in men has been on the stable level, even with the tendency to decline in last decade in Poland. Incidence and mortality rates among women have continued to increase, although the trend of increase has slowed in last years. Demographic distribution of lung cancer shows decline of the rates in young and middle age population and continuation of increase in old age people. Despite of some improvement of epidemiological situation in lung cancer in Poland it still remains the most common malignancy in men and is on the third position in most frequent cancers in woman. Lung cancer in Poland remains serious medical and social problem.","title":"[Lung cancer in Poland in 1970-2004].","pubmedId":"18283651"}
