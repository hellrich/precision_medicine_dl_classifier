Mean age was 61 years (25-85 years). All patients had undergone tumor resection with axillary lymph node dissection: 373 patients (47.8%) underwent mastectomy, 37 (5%) subcutaneous mastectomy and 370 (47.2%) tumorectomy.\nEGFR levels ranged between non-detectable up to 789 fmol/mg protein. EGFR median value was 9 fmol/mg protein and only a small proportion of patients exhibited a relatively marked EGFR expression. There was no link between tumor size, grade, node status and EGFR tumoral levels. There was a constant and significant decrease in EGFR tumoral levels according to patient age. A significant inverse relationship was found between estradiol receptors (ER) and EGFR. Median follow-up was 97 months with a minimum at 4 months and a maximum at 228 months. From univariate analysis it was found that histological grade, tumor size, node status and ER status were all significant predictors of survival, considering metastasis-free as well as overall survival. Using multivariable analysis, only histological grade, tumor size and node status remained independent predictors of survival.\nEGFR determination is of limited value as a prognostic indicator in breast cancer.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in 780 breast cancer patients: a reappraisal of the prognostic value based on an eight-year median follow-up.","pubmedId":"11484962"}
