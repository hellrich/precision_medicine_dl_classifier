All patients underwent surgery. Radiotherapy was performed twice following surgery. Local failure, nodal failure and distant metastasis are analyzed. Death appears to be related mainly to local failure. Radiotherapy does not seem to improve the local control obtained by surgery alone. Surgery must then be total and if necessary mutilating. Radiotherapy associated to surgery might be useful in case of extensive tumors for which complete eradication is not possible. A review of the world literature is performed.","title":"[Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the parotid gland].","pubmedId":"1850211"}
