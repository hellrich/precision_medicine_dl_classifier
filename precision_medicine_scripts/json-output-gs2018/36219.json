The enzymes studied were gamma glutamyltransferase (gammaGT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 5\u0027-nucleotidase (5\u0027-NT), glutathione reductase (GR), alanine and aspartate transaminases. In patients without liver metastases, elevated enzyme levels were found in 11-55% preoperatively. 5\u0027-NT showed the least number of elevated activities, while gammaGT activities were increased in 29% and LDH in 55%. The percentage of elevated enzyme levels rose significantly in the early postoperative period. Patients with liver metastases showed increased enzyme activities in 40-60% preoperatively: gammaGT was the most sensitive indicator. Increased enzyme activity was related to the degree of liver involvement with secondary tumor. With extensive liver metastases, gammaGT levels were increased in 82%. It is concluded that serum enzymes are of limited value in the preoperative detection of liver metastases, and particularly when tumor involvement of the liver is small.","title":"Serum enzymes in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"36219"}
