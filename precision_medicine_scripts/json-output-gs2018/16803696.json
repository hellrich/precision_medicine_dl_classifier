Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV antibodies were tested using the t-test, chi-square test, and logistic regression.\nAmong the 297 subjects, 13.1% were positive for HBsAg, 8.4% were positive for anti-HCV, and 1.7% were positive for combined HBsAg and anti-HCV. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that tattooing (odds ratio\u003d2.24, 95% CI\u003d1.03-4.88) and an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) level (odds ratio\u003d4.10, 95% CI\u003d1.61-10.40) were independently related to HCV infection.\nScreening of HBV and HCV infection in prison populations remains necessary. Tattooing and elevated ALAT level are identified as the related factors of HCV infection.","title":"Screening for viral hepatitis among male non-drug-abuse prisoners.","pubmedId":"16803696"}
