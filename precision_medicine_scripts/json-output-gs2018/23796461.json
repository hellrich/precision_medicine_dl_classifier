The mutant enzymes acquire a neomorphic activity that converts α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), a rare metabolite. In cells and tissues expressing mutant IDH, D2HG concentrations are highly elevated. D2HG may act as an \"oncometabolite\" by inhibiting a class of α-KG-dependent enzymes involved in epigenetic regulation, collagen synthesis, and cell signaling. Knock-in mouse models of IDH1 mutations have shed light on these mechanisms and will provide valuable animal models for further investigation.
