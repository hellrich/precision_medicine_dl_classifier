Only the third histological investigation with immunophenotyping resulted in the correct diagnosis of CD30(+) ALK(+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma. After combined chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy, complete remission of the disease was achieved and one year after completion of therapy no relapse occurred. The diagnostic pitfalls and therapeutic options are discussed. ","title":"[Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma CD30(+) ALK(+)].","pubmedId":"26620365"}
