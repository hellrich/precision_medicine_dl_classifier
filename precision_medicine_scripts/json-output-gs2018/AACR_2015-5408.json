FLT3 inhibitors are active, but their activity is limited and transient. New treatments and approaches are needed. The novel retinamide (NR) VNLG-152, targets translation by promoting degradation of MAPK-interacting kinases (Mnks), thereby inhibiting phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a downstream target of FLT3-ITD. eIF4E aids in translation by recruiting ribosomes to mRNA, a process that is upregulated in AML with FLT3-ITD. The association of the eIF4E protein complex is the rate- limiting step in translation initiation. We characterized the effects of VNLG-152 in AML cell lines and patient samples with FLT3-ITD and with wild-type FLT3.Methods: Cell lines studied included human MV4-11 and MOLM-14, with endogenous FLT3-ITD expression, HL60 and U937, with wild-type FLT3, and Ba/F3-ITD and Ba/F3-WT, which are murine Ba/F3 cells transfected with human FLT3-ITD and wild-type FLT3, respectively. Cytotoxicity was measured in a WST-1 colorimetric assay, proliferation by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining, and apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide labeling, measured by flow cytometry. AML patient samples obtained on an IRB-approved protocol were studied in cytotoxicity assays.Results: VNLG-152 was cytotoxic to the human FLT3-ITD AML cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-14 with low micromolar IC50 concentrations, while IC50 concentrations were greater than 10 M in the wild-type FLT3 AML cell lines HL60 and U937. IC50s in Ba/F3-ITD and Ba/F3-WT cells were 3.6 M (95% CI, 3.0-3.9 M) and 5.7 M (95% CI, 5.0-6.4 M), respectively. The cellular effects of VNLG-152 were evaluated further in Ba/F3-ITD cells. Concentration-dependent slowing of proliferation was seen at low micromolar concentrations, while concentration-dependent pro-apoptotic effects occurred at higher concentrations. VNLG-152 was also cytotoxic to blasts isolated from FLT3-ITD AML patient samples at IC50 concentrations \u003c1 M, whereas its IC50 concentrations in blasts from AML patient samples with wild-type FLT3 were \u003e 5 M.Conclusion: We conclude that the novel Mnk degrading agent VNLG-152 is active in AML with FLT3-ITD. Subsequent work will examine combinations with FLT3 inhibitors and with chemotherapy drugs in this prognostically unfavorable AML subtype.","title":"The novel retinamide VNLG-152, which targets translation by promoting degradation of MAPK-interacting kinases, has preferential activity in acute myeloid leukemia with FLT3-ITD","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-5408"}
