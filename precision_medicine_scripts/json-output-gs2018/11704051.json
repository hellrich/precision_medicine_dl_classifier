A 43-year-old woman who had been treated for papillary thyroid carcinoma 30 years earlier presented for evaluation of vision loss in the left eye. Eight weeks before this presentation, an ophthalmologist had diagnosed a metastatic uveal mass in the left eye of the patient. The clinical record was retrospectively reviewed. Ocular sonography was performed to confirm the diagnosis of choroidal metastasis.\nThe choroidal mass had the typical characteristics of a metastatic lesion. The patient was treated with a combination of brachytherapy and chemotherapy.\nPapillary thyroid carcinoma can metastasize to the choroid many years after the initial diagnosis.","title":"Late choroidal metastasis secondary to papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11704051"}
