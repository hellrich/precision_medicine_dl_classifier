While wild-type IDHs mediate exchanges between isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), mutant IDHs convert α-KG to oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which causes dysregulation of a set of α-KG-dependent dioxygenases such as TET, histone demethylase and others. Because mutant IDH has no necessary functions in normal cells, inhibitors directed against mutant IDH are not expected to have the side effects as anti-cancer agents. To determine whether mutant IDH enzymes are valid targets for cancer therapy, we created a mouse model of mutant IDH2-dependent AML. By using a combination of AML model mice with cre-loxp, we conditionally deleted mutant IDH2 from AML mice, which resulted in the loss of leukemia stem cells and significantly delayed the progression of AML. These results indicate that mutant IDHs are promising targets for anticancer therapy.
