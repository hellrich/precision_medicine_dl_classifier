Its most aggressive subtype, characterized by the amplification of the MYCN oncogene, has a dismal prognosis and no effective treatment is available. Understanding the alterations induced by the tumor on the various layers of gene expression is therefore important for a complete characterization of this neuroblastoma subtype and for the discovery of new therapeutic opportunities. Here we describe the profiling of 13 MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines at the genome (copy number), transcriptome, translatome and miRome levels (GEO series GSE56654, GSE56552 and GSE56655). We provide detailed experimental and data analysis procedures by means of which we derived the results described in [1].
