The translocation was reciprocal between chromosomes 12 and 14. Four of 5 family members carrying the gene for intestinal neurofibromatosis had the translocation. This may be due to change alone or linkage of the gene for intestinal neurofibromatosis to one of the translocation breakpoints in chromosome bands 12q13 and 14q13.","title":"Hereditary intestinal neurofibromatosis.
