The status of KIT mutations is of interest because they usually are mutually exclusive with N-RAS and B-RAF mutations and because of the availability of KIT kinase inhibitors in the clinic. Some recurrent KIT mutations are well characterized; others are poorly described.OBSERVATIONS We describe a novel KIT mutation in a patient with metastatic melanoma. The mutation, located in exon 13, resulted in S628N substitution in the KIT receptor. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical assays, and cell-based assays, we showed that the mutation is a bona fide gain-of-function oncogenic mutation. Furthermore,we evaluated the sensitivity of the mutant to imatinib and dasatinib.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We report a novel KIT gain-of-function mutation with S628N substitution (exon 13) and show that it is sensitive to imatinib in vitro. Therefore, patients with this mutation may be eligible for KIT kinase inhibitorâ€“based therapy. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical benefit of such therapy.","title":"Characterization of S628N: a novel KIT mutation found in a metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"25317746"}
