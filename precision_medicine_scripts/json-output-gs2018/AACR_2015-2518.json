In mouse skin, a subset of dendritic cell characterised by the expression of the chemokine receptor XCR1 is highly potent to activate CD8+ T cells. By combining PLEASE-assisted laser poration of the skin allowing dermal delivery and the use of dimeric vaccine molecule in which the XCR1 ligand, Xcl1, was fused to the antigen, we targeted specifically this XCR1+ dermal subset.ResultsDermal delivery of this vaccine molecule after skin laser-poration induced specific strong T cell proliferation in an XCR1-dependent manner. A single immunization allowed protecting against melanoma in both therapeutic and prophylactic protocols.Discussion \u0026 ConclusionThus, specific targeting of cross-presenting skin DCs represents a promising vaccine strategy for induction of CD8+ T cell responses and protection against cancers.","title":"Effective vaccination against melanoma in an animal study: Combination of laser-assisted dermal skin delivery and cross-presenting XCR1+ dermal DCs targeting","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2518"}
