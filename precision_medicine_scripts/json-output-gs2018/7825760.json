Estimated median survival was 89 months. Several pretreatment factors were associated with failure to achieve a major cytogenetic response and with worse survival. The existing prognostic models were generally predictive of which patients were likely to achieve a major cytogenetic response (P \u003c or \u003d 0.01) and of survival outcomes (P \u003c or \u003d 0.01). Multivariate analysis identified bone marrow basophilia (P \u003c 0.01) and splenomegaly (P \u003c 0.01) as independent poor prognostic factors for survival. Achievement of a major cytogenetic response, entered as a time-dependent variable while accounting for the other independent factors, was associated with improved survival (P \u003c 0.001). Comparison of survival (dated from 12 months into therapy) with cytogenetic response at 12 months showed that a cytogenetic response was associated with longer survival (P \u003c 0.001).\nAchieving a cytogenetic response with interferon-alpha therapy in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia was independently associated with improved survival when tested as a time-dependent variable in a multivariate analysis, and this association was confirmed by landmark analysis at 12 months.","title":"Prolonged survival in chronic myelogenous leukemia after cytogenetic response to interferon-alpha therapy.
