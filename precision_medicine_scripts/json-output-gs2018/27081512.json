We performed targeted resequencing using a next-generation sequencer to analyze genes associated with known clinical phenotypes in an 11-year-old male with sporadic jaw keratocysts. A novel duplication mutation (c.426dup) in PTCH1, resulting in a truncated protein, was identified. ","title":"A novel PTCH1 mutation in a patient with Gorlin syndrome.","pubmedId":"27081512"}
