However, the significance of the B-RAF mutation (B-RAFmt) in terms of its prognostic and predictive capabilities for treatment response or disease outcome is not known. We hypothesized that circulating serum B-RAFmt (B-RAFsmt) at V600E, detected in serum, predicts response in melanoma patients receiving concurrent biochemotherapy.\nA real-time clamp quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay was designed to assess B-RAFsmt by peptide nucleic acid clamping and a locked nucleic acid hybrid probe. Normal (n \u003d 18) and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to IV melanoma patients (n \u003d 103) were evaluated. These included stage IV patients (n \u003d 48) with blood drawn before and after biochemotherapy. Patients were classified as biochemotherapy responders or nonresponders. Responders (n \u003d 24) had a complete or partial response following biochemotherapy; nonresponders (n \u003d 24) developed progressive disease.\nOf the 103 melanoma patients, 38 (37%) had B-RAFsmt DNA, of which 11 of 34 (32%) were stage I or II, and 27 of 69 (39%) were stage III or IV. Of the 48 biochemotherapy patients, 10 of 24 (42%) patients were positive for the B-RAFsmt in the respective responder and nonresponder groups before treatment. After biochemotherapy, B-RAFsmt was detected in only 1 of 10 patients (10%) in the responder group and 7 of 10 patients (70%) in the nonresponder group. B-RAFsmt is associated with significantly worse (P \u003d 0.039) overall survival in patients receiving biochemotherapy.\nThese studies show the presence and utility of circulating B-RAFsmt DNA in melanoma patients.","title":"Utility of circulating B-RAF DNA mutation in serum for monitoring melanoma patients receiving biochemotherapy.","pubmedId":"17404088"}
