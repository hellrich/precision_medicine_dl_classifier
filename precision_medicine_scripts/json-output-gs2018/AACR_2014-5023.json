We have tested the antitumor effect of the IDO pathway inhibitor NLG-919 (currently in Phase I clinical trial) in combination with indoximod (a different IDO pathway inhibitor currently in Phase II clinical trials), chemotherapy, vaccination and/or PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 blockade. Here we show that the highly potent, orally-bioavailable IDO pathway inhibitor NLG-919 is synergistic with blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 pathway in mouse models of large established tumors. The combination of NLG-919 plus PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 blockade showed significantly enhanced anti-tumor effect compared to either agent alone. This synergy was particularly evident in the setting of large established tumors treated with normally ineffective immunotherapy regimens (e.g., a single dose of chemotherapy plus a vaccine against a poorly immunogenic shared-self antigen). In vivo, administration of NLG-919 enhanced anti-tumor vaccine responses against B16F10 melanoma treated with hgp100 vaccine plus resting, non-activated pmel-1 T cells NLG-919 also reduced Treg-mediated suppression in tumor-bearing hosts, and enhanced dendritic cell activation in tumors and TDLNs. In combination with chemotherapy, treatment with NLG-919 allowed effector T cell responses against endogenous tumor antigens released by chemotherapy. By each of the preceding readouts, the in vivo biologic effect of NLG-919 was qualitatively identical to that of indoximod, but the same immunologic effects could be achieved at lower plasma concentrations in vivo. In multiple models, a combination of oral NLG-919 with oral indoximod produced synergistic anti-tumor effects, which was further enhanced by blockade of the PD 1/PD L1/PD-L2 pathway. In a more stringent B16F10 melanoma tumor model that did not involve adoptive transfer of pmel-1 cells, a combination of immune checkpoint inhibition involving NLG-919, indoximod and anti-PD1/PD-L1/PD-L2 antibodies with chemotherapy and hgp100 peptide vaccine was able to achieve a significant antitumor effect. The current preclinical studies suggest a mechanistic rationale for a combining NLG919 with indoximod and with agents targeting the PD 1/PD L1/PD-L2 pathway.","title":"Synergistic antitumor effects of combinatorial immune checkpoint inhibition with anti-PD-1/PD-L antibodies and the IDO pathway inhibitors NLG-919 and indoximod in the context of active immunotherapy","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-5023"}
