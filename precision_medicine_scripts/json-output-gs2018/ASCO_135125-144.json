FOLFOXIRI has shown a higher RR and pts sent to resection than FOLFIRI.  EGFR inhibitors improve RR by approximately 10%.  This phase II, non-randomized, multicenter trial evaluated the RR of the combination of FOLFOXIRI plus pmab as first-line treatment for pts with KRAS wild-type mCRC with liver-only metastasis.   Methods:  Pts with liver-only KRAS wild-type mCRC received FOLFOXIRI (5-FU 3200 mg/m2 48-hour continuous IV; LV 200 mg/m2 IV; irinotecan 125 mg/m2 IV; oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV) and pmab (6 mg/kg IV) day 1 of each 14-day cycle.  Restaging occurred every 4 cycles.  Surgical evaluation occurred at baseline and with each restaging.  The primary endpoint was overall RR. Secondary endpoints included: rate of R0 resection, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.  Results:  Fifteen pts were enrolled: median age 55 yrs, 87% male, 8 pts (15%) were resectable at baseline.  Pts received a median of 6 cycles (1  33).  Common treatment-related grade 3 toxicities included diarrhea (33%), and rash (20%).  One pt (7%) experienced grade 4 neutropenia.  Of the 12 pts evaluable for clinical response, 9 pts achieved partial response (PR), and stable disease was noted in 3 pts.  RR of evaluable pts was 75%.  Nine pts continued to resection all of which were pPR; 8 (88%) had R0 resection.  Median PFS was 13.3 months (95% CI: 4.2  NA).  Median OS is not yet reached.  As the trial enrolled new data emerged of expanded KRAS/NRAS mutations and potential for negative interaction with oxaliplatin-based therapy.  For this reason the trial was halted and pts on study underwent expanded KRAS/NRAS mutation analysis.  6/15 pts have had analysis performed.  None of the tested pts were found to have additional KRAS/NRAS mutation.   Conclusions:  FOLFOXIRI-pmab is a well-tolerated regimen with high RR.  This study was stopped early due to the necessity of expanded KRAS/NRAS testing, but this regimen is a viable option for the treatment of pts with liver-only mCRC.
