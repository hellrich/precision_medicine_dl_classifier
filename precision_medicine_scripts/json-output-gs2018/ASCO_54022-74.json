SPARC in the tumor microenvironment may be associated with tumor cells and stromal components. While previous studies examined SPARC only in tumor cells and/or fibroblasts, it remains unclear which tumor SPARC components may be associated with poor prognosis in different tumors. Recently we have found that plasma SPARC may contribute to poor outcomes in tumor models. Herein, we examined all tumor microenvironment components as well as plasma SPARC levels to develop a SPARC signature that may be correlated to outcomes. Methods: 76 chemo nave and pretreated patients (pts) with unresectable stage IV melanoma were treated with nab-paclitaxel (nab-P, 100 mg/m2) and carboplatin (C, AUC 2) on d 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle until disease progression. SPARC in tumor biopsies was measured using a validated SPARC IHC. IHC data were analyzed using array analysis programs. SPARC plasma level in pts (baseline and posttreatment [Tx]) and normal controls were quantitated using a validated SPARC ELISA (blinded to patient outcome). Results: Tumor SPARC IHC data was available for 40 pts. A unique SPARC signature was developed for melanoma pts to distinguish early progressers (LR, n \u003d 9) from later progressers (HR, n \u003d 31). Median PFS increased from 3.8 to 6.7 months (logrank, p \u003d 0.02) and median OS increased from 9.6 to 18.0 months (p \u003d 0.07) for the HR vs. LR groups, respectively. Plasma SPARC levels were higher in melanoma pts than normal controls (median 259 ng/ml [95% CI \u003d 273-327], n \u003d 321 from 76 pts; vs. median 153 ng/mL [95% CI \u003d 99-207], n \u003d 50 from 50 pts; t-test, p \u003c 0.0001). Conclusions: The SPARC microenvironment signatures (SMS) was designed to discriminate between low-risk and high-risk groups with respect to PFS/OS. These data suggest that SPARC in the tumor microenvironment may play an important role in the outcome of melanoma pts. Plasma SPARC levels in melanoma pts were higher than normal controls. Correlation of plasma SPARC with outcomes will be presented at ASCO.","title":"Tumor SPARC microenvironment signature (SMS) and plasma levels in a phase II trial of unresectable stage IV melanoma treated with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin: A translational study of NCCTG trial N057E.","pubmedId":"ASCO_54022-74"}
