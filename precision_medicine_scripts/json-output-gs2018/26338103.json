We explored whether expression and activation of EGFR and several components on its downstream pathways have prognostic significance in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).\nExpression of EGFR, phosphorylated (p)-EGFR, AKT1, p-AKT1, AKT2, p-AKT2, ERK1, ERK2, p-ERK1/2, STAT3, and p-STAT3 was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays for 275 ESCC patients who had undergone complete three-field lymphadenectomy. Spearman rank correlation tests were used to determine the relationships among protein expression, and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the prognostic factors on overall survival (OS).\np-EGFR expression was correlated statistically with all of the other phosphorylated markers. Gender, N stage, and p-AKT1 expression were found to be independent prognostic factors for OS. Increased expression of p-AKT1 was associated with decreased patient survival. EGFR and p-EGFR expression was not significantly associated with patient survival.\nActivation of AKT1 was associated with poor prognosis in ESCC.","title":"Phosphorylated AKT1 is associated with poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26338103"}
