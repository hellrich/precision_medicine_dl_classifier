Some biliary IPNs are histologically and radiologically similar to intraductal papillary mucinous tumors (IPMNs) of the pancreas and present a risk for progression to invasive cholangiocarcinoma. Unlike pancreatic IPMNs, little is known about their molecular pathogenesis. We studied 14 biliary IPNs (including 5 cases with associated invasive cholangiocarcinoma) for genetic alterations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway, K-ras oncogene mutations, p53/chromosome 17p alterations, and Dpc4/18q alterations. Immunohistochemistry was performed for beta-catenin, p53, and Dpc4, and microdissected tissue was analyzed using direct DNA sequencing for exon 1 of K-ras and exon 3 of beta-catenin and allelic loss assays on chromosomes 5q, 17p, and 18q. Activating mutations in codon 12 of the K-ras oncogene were present in 4 of 14 (29%) biliary IPNs. Of these 4 cases, 2 patients had associated invasive cholangiocarcinoma, and identical K-ras mutations were present in both the intraductal and invasive components. Allelic loss on chromosome 18q was present in 4 of 13 informative cases (31%); however, no loss of normal Dpc4 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin protein was demonstrated in 3 of 12 cases (25%); however, there were no beta-catenin gene mutations, and allelic loss on 5q was present in only 1 of 10 informative cases (10%). Both immunohistochemistry for p53 and 17p allelic loss assays were negative. Biliary IPNs therefore demonstrate a K-ras gene mutation frequency that is lower than that previously reported for pancreatic IPMNs, but similar to that reported for hepatic cholangiocarcinomas. The presence of K-ras mutations in 2 purely intraductal neoplasms, and identical K-ras mutations in 2 cases with both intraductal and invasive components, suggests that these mutations arise early in tumorigenesis. Finally, the frequency of allelic loss on 18q suggests that a locus on 18q is involved in the molecular pathogenesis of biliary IPNs, but this locus is not DPC4.","title":"Molecular and immunohistochemical analysis of intraductal papillary neoplasms of the biliary tract.","pubmedId":"14562286"}
