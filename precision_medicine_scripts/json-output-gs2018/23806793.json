We aimed to investigate the prevalence and prognostic significance of alterations in FGFR1 copy number in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). FGFR1 status was evaluated by chromogenic silver in situ hybridisation (ISH) in tissue microarray sections from a retrospective cohort of 304 surgically resected NSCLCs and results were correlated with the clinicopathological features and overall survival. High FGFR1 gene copy number (amplification or high-level polysomy) was significantly more frequent in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) (24.8%) and large cell carcinomas (LCC) (25%) compared to adenocarcinomas (11.3%) (p \u003d 0.01 and p \u003d 0.03 respectively). Among NSCLC there was no significant correlation between FGFR1-positive status and other clinicopathological features including age, gender, smoking history, tumour size, lymph node status, stage, grade, vascular, lymphatic or perineural invasion. FGFR1-positive patients showed a tendency to longer overall survival in univariate analysis (p \u003d 0.14). Multivariate survival analysis using Cox regression model confirmed FGFR1-positive patients had a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to FGFR1-negative patients (HR 0.6; p \u003d 0.02). High FGFR1 gene copy number is a common finding in SCC and LCC and is an independent favourable prognostic factor.","title":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) copy number is an independent prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23806793"}
