Direct DNA sequencing, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect IDH1 mutation and IDH1 gene expression levels in 97 cases of glioma and 9 cases of other CNS tumors. IDH1 mutation was heterozygous, with wild-type arginine 132 replaced by histidine (R132H). Expression in different glioma subtypes was (1) 0 out if 5 in pilocytic astrocytoma; (2) 15 out of 22 in diffuse astrocytoma, 6 out of 9 in oligodendroglioma, 4 out of 6 in oligoastrocytoma, and 0 out of 4 in ependymoma; (3) 11 out of 19 in anaplastic astrocytoma, 4 out of 7 in anaplastic oligodendroglioma, 3 out of 4 in anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and 0 out of 3 in anaplastic ependymoma; and (4) 1 out of 6 in primary glioblastoma, 8 out of 10 in secondary glioblastoma, and 0 out of 2 in medulloblastoma. IDH1 mutation is a somatic mutation that is found only in some glioma subtypes. It can be used as a molecular marker for glioma subtypes. For example, it can be used to distinguish primary glioblastoma from secondary glioblastoma, combining TP53 mutation and loss of heterozygosity involving 1p/19q. It can also be used as a marker for some gliomas. For example, it can be used to distinguish pilocytic astrocytoma from diffuse astrocytoma, combining detected BRAF proto-oncogene mutations.","title":"Analysis of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation in 97 patients with glioma.","pubmedId":"22113362"}
