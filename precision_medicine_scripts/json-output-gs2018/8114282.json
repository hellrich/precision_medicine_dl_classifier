In compensated liver cirrhosis, sex hormone binding globulin is increased, and is related with increasing serum total testosterone. Serum total and free estradiol levels and ratio of estradiol to testosterone are increased in cirrhotic patients. Hyperestrogenization is related with female physical characteristics. Gonadal dysfunctions observed in cirrhotic patients are primary in the gonadal failure, then a concomitant with pituitary defect occurs. These abnormalities in liver cirrhosis are reversible.","title":"[Gonadal dysfunctions in liver cirrhosis].","pubmedId":"8114282"}
