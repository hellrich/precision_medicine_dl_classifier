We immunostained 62 primary cutaneous and 15 metastatic melanomas for polyclonal c-kit (pc-kit), monoclonal c-kit (mc-kit), PKCθ, and DOG1 and correlated results with prognostic parameters and survival. Of the cutaneous melanomas, 34 (55%) stained for pc-kit, 30 (48%) for mc-kit, 11 (18%) for PKCθ, and 2 (3%) for DOG1. The Breslow depth was 1.00 mm or less in 21 (68%) of 31 pc-kit+ cutaneous melanomas compared with 7 (27%) of 26 pc-kit- melanomas (P \u003d .002). The pc-kit+ melanomas had less nodal disease (1/31 [3%] vs 9/25 [36%]; P \u003d .001) and local recurrence (1/33 [3%] vs 6/27 [22%]; P \u003d .021) but no statistically significant difference in the rate of distant metastases (13/32 [41%] vs 14/27 [52%]; P \u003d .388) or survival (10/34 [29%] vs 16/39 [41%]; P \u003d .301). We found that pc-kit correlates better with prognostic parameters than does mc-kit.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor markers in cutaneous melanomas: relationship to prognostic factors and outcome.","pubmedId":"21685034"}
