The MUC1 oncoprotein is aberrantly expressed in AML cells; however, there has been no evidence for involvement of MUC1 in FLT3-ITD signaling. We show that the FLT3-ITD associates with the MUC1 oncoprotein thereby leading to a new therapeutic target. We have synthesized MUC1-C peptide inhibitors that penetrate cells and bind to the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain blocking its oncogenic function. In the present study, we demonstrate that MUC1-C peptide inhibitor treatment of the FLT3-ITD positive human MOLM-14, MV4-11 AML cell lines, and primary blasts from patients with AML, leads to growth arrest and induction of late apoptosis/necrosis. MUC1-C inhibitor-induced cell death of these cells is associated with significant downregulation of phospho-FLT3-ITD, indicating that inhibition of MUC1-C blocks FLT3-ITD activation. Taken together, these findings provide support for the evaluation of the MUC1-C inhibitor, GO-203-2C (an agent now undergoing Phase I evaluation in solid tumors), in the treatment of patients with AML harboring the FLT3-ITD activating mutation.","title":"Targeting the MUC1-C oncoprotein blocks activation of FLT-3/ITD and induces death of acute myeloid leukemia cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-173"}
