Understanding the failure of spontaneous or vaccine-induced tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses to promote the immunologic clearance of melanomas is critical. Multiple mechanisms of melanoma-induced immune escape, which are likely to cause the failure of the spontaneous or vaccine-induced immune responses to promote tumor regression in humans, have been elucidated. In addition, a number of negative factors in the tumor microenvironment dampen antitumor immune responses, including cytokines (like transforming growth factor-β or interleukin-10), suppressive cells (regulatory T cells and myelosuppressive dendritic cells), defective antigen presentation by tumor cells (human leukocyte antigen or T antigen expression loss, antigen processing machinery defects), amino acid catabolizing enzymes (indoleamine-2-3 dioxygenase, arginase), and immune inhibitory pathways (like cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4/cluster of differentiation 28, programmed death 1/programmed death 1 ligand 1). This information has been used to develop a number of therapies to specifically target these negative regulators of antimelanoma immune responses to enhance tumor antigen-specific immune responses and to increase the likelihood of clinical benefits in patients with advanced melanoma.","title":"Strategies to reverse melanoma-induced T-cell dysfunction.","pubmedId":"23608444"}
