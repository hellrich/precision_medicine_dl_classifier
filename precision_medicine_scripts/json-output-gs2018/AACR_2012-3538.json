The tumor microenvironment of transplanted and spontaneous mouse tumors is profoundly deprived of oxygenation as confirmed by PET imaging. CD8 and CD4 tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) of transplanted colon carcinomas, melanomas and spontaneous breast adenocarcinomas are CD137 (4-1BB) positive, as opposed to their counterparts in tumor draining lymph nodes and spleen. Expression of CD137 on activated T lymphocytes is markedly enhanced by hypoxia and the prolyl-hydroxilase inhibitor DMOG. Importantly, hypoxia does not up-regulate CD137 in inducible HIF-1 knock-out T cells, and such HIF-1-deficient T cells remain CD137-negative even when becoming TILs, in clear contrast to co-infiltrating HIF-1-sufficient T cells. The fact that CD137 is selectively expressed on TILs was exploited to confine the effects of immunotherapy with agonist anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the tumor tissue, thereby avoiding liver inflammation, while still permitting synergistic therapeutic effects with PD-L1/B7-H1 blockade.","title":"The HIF-1 hypoxia response in mouse tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes induces functional CD137 (4-1BB) for immunotherapy","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-3538"}
