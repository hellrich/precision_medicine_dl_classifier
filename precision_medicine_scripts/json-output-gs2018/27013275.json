Establishing the diagnostic BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript is necessary in order to select appropriate primers and probes for such monitoring. A case is described in which quantitative polymerase chain reaction failed to detect the presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript in a Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia patient. Further investigation demonstrated a novel in-frame BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript with a breakpoint in BCR exon 13 and insertion of a sequence of ABL1 intron 1, therefore enabling subsequent molecular monitoring. This case highlights the requirement for characterization of the BCR-ABL1 transcript type at chronic myeloid leukemia diagnosis. Issues concerning standardized methodological approaches and interpretation of transcript levels in such rare cases are discussed.","title":"Characterization of a novel variant BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia: Implications for molecular monitoring.","pubmedId":"27013275"}
