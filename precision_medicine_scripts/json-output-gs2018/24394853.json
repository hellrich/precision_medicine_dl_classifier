However, the presence of multiple foci of both types of malignancy in the same gland is very rare.\nA 39 year-old female with multiple thyroid nodules, elevated serum calcitonin levels and elastographic findings suggestive of thyroid malignancy, underwent total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection. Histology revealed the presence of one focus of medullary and one focus of papillary carcinoma on each thyroid lobe. Subsequently, the patient underwent treatment with radioactive iodine.\nThis is the third case of synchronous multifocal medullary and papillary thyroid carcinoma reported in the literature. Several theories for the simultaneous development of these malignant entities have been proposed.\nUltrasound elastography can be a useful, noninvasive tool in the assessment of thyroid nodules.","title":"Synchronous multifocal medullary and papillary thyroid microcarcinoma detected by elastography.","pubmedId":"24394853"}
