This review addresses the current standing of male contraception, long the poor relation in family planning but currently enjoying a resurgence in both scientific and political interest as it is recognized that men have a larger role to play in the regulation of fertility, whether seen in geopolitical or individual terms. Condoms and vasectomy continue to be popular at particular phases of the reproductive lifespan and in certain cultures. Although not perfect contraceptives, condoms have the additional advantage of offering protection from sexually transmitted infection. The hormonal approach may have acquired the critical mass needed to make the transition from academic research to pharmaceutical development. Greatly increased understanding of male reproductive function, partly stimulated by interest in ageing and the potential benefits of androgen replacement, is opening up other avenues for investigation taking advantage of nonhormonal regulatory pathways specific to spermatogenesis and the reproductive tract.","title":"Male contraception.","pubmedId":"12466187"}
