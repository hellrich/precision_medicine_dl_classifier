In AML patients, FLT3-ITD mutation was present in 59 cases (15.9%) while D835 mutation in 15 cases (4.0%); and in ALL patients, none for FLT3-ITD while D835 mutation in 2 cases (2.4%). FLT3-ITD mutation might adversely affect clinical outcome in AML patients (excluding APL) with a lower CR rate (52.3% vs 71.2%) and a shorter median survival (9 months vs 18 months). For APL FLT3-ITD mutation had no effect on CR rate, but with a shorter DFS and OS. There was no evidence that FLT3-D835 affected the prognosis.\nFLT3 mutation is more frequently present in AML and FLT3-ITD is associated with lower CR rate and shorter median survival time while FLT3-D835 has no such effect.","title":"[FLT3 gene mutation and its prognostic implication in patients with acute leukemia.].","pubmedId":"20302766"}
