This neoplasm represents a rare occurrence, and as a rule, differential diagnosis with melanoma often requires detailed immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic analysis (ie, rearrangement of EWS gene localized on 22q12 chromosome). Because wide resection is recommended, chest wall reconstruction may pose challenging technical issues. In our patient, we elected not to proceed to clavicular stabilization. Nevertheless, acceptable shoulder girdle mobility was observed after surgery.","title":"Primary giant clear cell sarcoma (soft tissue malignant melanoma) of the sternum.","pubmedId":"19463625"}
