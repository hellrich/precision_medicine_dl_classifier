Familial GIST syndrome based on a hereditary predisposition to develop GIST owing to a germline mutation is exceedingly rare. We describe a kindred with familial GIST displaying a novel germline mutation in exon 17. Three siblings (2 females, 1 male; 42 to 49 y) underwent surgery for multiple intra-abdominal tumors within a 3-year period. Their father had been operated on for gastric and jejunal tumors 20 years previously. The GIST was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in each sibling. Tumor and blood samples of the family members were analyzed for mutations in KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRalpha) genes. All examined lesions were of spindle cell type with expression of CD117. The tumor material exhibited a novel point mutation in codon 822 in exon 17 resulting in the replacement of asparagine by tyrosine (N822Y). The same mutation was detected in the father\u0027s blood sample. One healthy brother of the 3 siblings showed a wild-type sequence of the KIT gene. The germline mutation in exon 17 of the KIT gene identified in this kindred is very different from previously reported mutations of the KIT gene in familial GIST. Although the penetrance of KIT mutations is as yet unknown, assessment of the unaffected kindred of GIST patients for the presence of this mutation could help to distinguish individuals at high risk from those at virtually no risk.","title":"Familial gastrointestinal stromal tumors caused by the novel KIT exon 17 germline mutation N822Y.","pubmedId":"18724244"}
