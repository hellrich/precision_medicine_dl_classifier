In particular, cancers with specific EGFR-activating mutations seem to be the most sensitive to these agents. However, despite their initial response, such cancers almost invariably develop resistance. In 50% of such cancers, a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, has been identified that renders gefitinib and erlotinib ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity. Thus, there is a clinical need to develop novel EGFR inhibitors that can effectively inactivate T790M-containing EGFR proteins. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of a novel compound, PF00299804, an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor. The results from these studies show that PF00299804 is a potent inhibitor of EGFR-activating mutations as well as the EGFR T790M resistance mutation both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, PF00299804 is a highly effective inhibitor of both the wild-type ERBB2 and the gefitinib-resistant oncogenic ERBB2 mutation identified in lung cancers. These preclinical evaluations support further clinical development of PF00299804 for cancers with mutations and/or amplifications of ERBB family members.","title":"PF00299804, an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor, is effective in lung cancer models with EGFR and ERBB2 mutations that are resistant to gefitinib.","pubmedId":"18089823"}
