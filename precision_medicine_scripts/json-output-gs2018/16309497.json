Determination of Gal-3 was performed by ELISA, and in the group of patients with melanoma, these results were compared with the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations.\nGal-3 concentration was shown to be significantly higher in the group of patients with melanoma compared with healthy volunteers, and Gal-3 concentration was significantly correlated with both LDH and CRP in the melanoma group. We also selected four patients in the melanoma group for Gal-3 retrospective immunostaining analysis on cutaneous metastases. Two of these patients, who had a higher Gal-3 serum level, showed more intense staining and the other two patients, with a lower serum level of Gal-3, had moderate immunostaining, suggesting that at least part of serum Gal-3 might be produced by metastatic melanoma tissue.\nGal-3 might play a role in melanoma progression and/or inflammation, and warrants further study.","title":"High serum galectin-3 in advanced melanoma: preliminary results.","pubmedId":"16309497"}
