Multiple cutaneous side effects like rash and keratoacanthoma-like lesions have been described so far.\nWe report a patient who presented multiple wart-like lesions under therapy with vemurafenib. Histologically we have seen multiple melanocytic nevi with a wart-like appearance. One melanoma in situ developed on the left forearm.\nEruptive nevi and induction of melanoma may be a further side effect in patients undergoing a therapy with BRAF inhibitors.","title":"Eruptive Nevi Mimicking Wart-Like Lesions under Selective BRAF Inhibition in a 37-Year-Old Female Melanoma Patient.","pubmedId":"23626542"}
