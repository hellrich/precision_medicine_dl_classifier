Although these functions are not yet well-characterized, they have been implicated in regulating of a number of cellular processes, including cell-cycle control, apoptosis, differentiation, genome stability, and transcription, among others. It appears that Mdm2 exerts these functions through a surprisingly wide variety of mechanisms. For example, it has been shown that Mdm2 can ubiquitinate alternative targets, can stimulate the activity of transcription factors, and can directly bind to mRNA to regulate its stability. Dysregulation of p53-independent functions could be responsible for the oncogenic properties of Mdm2 seen even in the absence of p53, and may explain why approximately 10 % of human tumors overexpress Mdm2 instead of inactivating p53 through other mechanisms. As the p53-independent functions of Mdm2 present novel targets for potential therapeutic interventions, fully characterizing these cellular and pathogenic roles of Mdm2 will be important in the study of tumor biology and the treatment of cancer.
