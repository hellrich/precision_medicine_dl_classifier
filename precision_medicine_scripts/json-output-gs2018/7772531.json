Recent molecular characterization of the translocation breakpoint has identified a gene fusion between NPM (nucleophosmin) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase). Using a DNA hybridization technique, the NPM rearrangement was found among 5/5 ALCL samples. We have developed a PCT methodology which has enabled the detection of the NPM-ALK rearrangements amongst seven t(2;5)(p23;q35) ALCL cases based on a long-range PCR of genomic DNA. The rapidity and robustness of this method may have diagnostic applications for ALCL.","title":"Detection of NPM-ALK DNA rearrangement in CD30 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"7772531"}
