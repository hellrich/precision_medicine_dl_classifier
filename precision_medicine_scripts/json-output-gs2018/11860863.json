Diagnostic criteria was based on the recommendation from WHO. Epidemiological characteristics of overweight and obesity were analysed.\nThe prevalence rate of overweight and obesity among Chinese adults were 21.51% and 2.92% respectively. The age-standardized prevalence rates of overweight and obesity standardized by Chinese population aged 20 - 74 years were 18.28% and 2.48% respectively in 1990, when standardized by the standard population of world in 1992, the prevalence rates were 18.61% and 2.49% respectively. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in female (21.71% and 3.73% respectively) were significantly higher in male (21.25% and 2.11% respectively), the prevalence rates of obesity in male and in female increased with the increase of age, with the lowest prevalence in 20 year old group (1.23% and 0.96% respectively), the highest were 60 year old group (3.30% and 6.91% respectively). Among 11 provinces, the highest prevalence rates of overweight and obesity were in Beijing (34.75% and 5.14% respectively) of males, and in Shandong (34.56% and 9.36% respectively) of females. The prevalence rates of obesity were significantly higher in northern part of the country (2.64% in males and 4.85% in females) then in the south (1.36% in males and 2.15% in females), as well as significantly higher in urban (2.65% in male and 4.21% in female) than in rural (0.88% in male and 2.80% in female).\nOverweight and obesity had become prevalent in Chinese adults, more seen in the north than in the south, more in females than in males, and in older age than in younger, suggesting an earlier research and practice of prevention and control for overweight and obesity need to be implemented in China.","title":"[A study on the epidemiological characteristics of obesity in Chinese Adults].","pubmedId":"11860863"}
