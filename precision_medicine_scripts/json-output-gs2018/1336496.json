Two human lung cancer cell lines, PC-1 and PC-13, were found to produce a protein which was indistinguishable from HGF/SF with regard to biological activities and immunological characteristics, although they were derived from epithelial cells. In general, highly aggressive cancer cells often show some mesenchymal characteristics, and production of HGF/SF by cancer cells is also considered as a phenomenon of acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype, which may be involved in cancer invasion and progression. These cell lines showed no apparent response to exogenous HGF/SF. In addition, no c-met proto-oncogene product was detectable in these cells by Western blot analysis. Although the function of HGF/SF produced by cancer cells, either autocrine or paracrine stimulation, remains to be studied, this is the first report to describe cancer cells producing HGF/SF.","title":"Human lung cancer cell line producing hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor.","pubmedId":"1336496"}
