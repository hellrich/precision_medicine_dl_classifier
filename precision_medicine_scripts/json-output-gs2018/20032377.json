The objective of the study was to analyze expression of these antigens and the proliferation rate in metastatic melanomas.\nFine-needle aspirates from 30 patients were analyzed. Immunocytochemical methods were applied to assess COX-2, HSP-90 and CD117. Cell proliferation was analysed using expression of Ki-67. Findings were compared with histopathological parameters.\nAll cases expressed COX-2 and HSP90. CD117 was expressed in 46% of cases. The proliferation index ranged between 7% and 54%. No correlation was found between histological properties of the primary tumours and expression of CD117, COX-2 and HSP90 in their metastases. An inverse correlation was found between HSP90 and MIB-1 index.\nA large proportion of metastatic melanomas expressed COX-2 and HSP90. This may have a clinical implication for blocking therapy of the corresponding molecules. Expression of CD117 antigen was observed in only 5/30 melanoma cases. We hypothesize that such melanomas may benefit from targeted therapy with kinase inhibitors.","title":"Expression of the CD117, COX-2 and HSP90 antigens and cell proliferation in fine-needle-aspirated cells from metastatic melanomas.","pubmedId":"20032377"}
