Only about 80 cases have been described so far in world literature. In contrast with the epidermoid carcinoma of the larynx, the adenoid cystic carcinoma is not apparently related to common risk factors such as smoking. However the prognosis is much worse, with survival rates of less than 20% after 15-20 years. Treatment is surgical, although radiotherapy may be of help. In this paper a new case of adenoid cystic carcinoma located in the supraglottis of a 26-years-old woman is reported and the world literature is reviewed.","title":"[Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the larynx].","pubmedId":"10619906"}
