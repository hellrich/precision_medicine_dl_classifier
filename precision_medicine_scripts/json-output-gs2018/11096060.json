We report a patient with acute renal failure secondary to diffuse bilateral renal infiltration by a Burkitt\u0027s lymphoma. The presence of bilateral renal enlargement, an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lymphopenia should suggest the diagnosis, which can be confirmed by renal biopsy.","title":"Acute renal failure as presentation of a Burkitt\u0027s lymphoma.","pubmedId":"11096060"}
