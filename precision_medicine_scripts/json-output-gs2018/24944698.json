This study identified a single-base substitution of G for A in codon 148 of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A/p16) by sequencing human ovarian cancer cell line UACC-1598. As a tumor suppressor gene, the expression of CDKN2A/p16 should be strictly controlled. In order to control CDKN2A/p16 gene expression, an inducible pTUNE vector system was selected. Using recombinant DNA technology, a CDKN2A/p16-A148T and CDKN2A/p16-wild-type gene expression system was successfully constructed to investigate whether this single-base substitution affects the function of CDKN2A/p16. For the wild-type and the mutant, expression of CDKN2A/p16-green fluorescent protein fusion protein increased markedly following isopropyl-Î²-D-thiogalactoside induction, and was accompanied by significant G1 arrest in the transfected human ovarian cancer SKOV3 cell line. The inducible vectors used in this study, CDKN2A/p16-wild-type and CDKN2A/p16-A148T open reading frame, may be useful for further investigation into whether this somatic mutation could alter the function of CDKN2A/p16 as a tumor suppressor gene. In summary, CDKN2A/p16-A148T was identified in ovarian cancer cells, and this single-base substitution did not affect the ability of CDKN2A/p16 to arrest the cell cycle.","title":"Effect of tumor suppressor gene cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A wild-type and A148T mutant on the cell cycle of human ovarian cancer cells.","pubmedId":"24944698"}
