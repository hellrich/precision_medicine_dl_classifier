We evaluated the association of LN-5 gamma2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).\nLN-5 gamma2 and EGFR expression was evaluated in 110 esophageal SCC patients by immunohistochemistry, and was confirmed using esophageal SCC cell lines by Western blot analysis.\nLN-5 gamma2 expression in the invasive front of the tumor was correlated with the depth of invasion (p \u003d 0.0001), lymph node metastasis (p \u003d 0.0011) and pathological stage (p \u003d 0.0001). The strong expression of EGFR was also correlated with lymph node metastasis (p \u003d 0.0456) and the pathological stage (p \u003d 0.0055). In patient survival, LN-5 gamma2 positivity and/or strong EGFR expression showed a significantly low survival rate as compared with those with lesser expression of LN-5 gamma2 and EGFR. Immunohistochemically, LN-5 gamma2 expression was significantly correlated with EGFR expression (p \u003c 0.0001). Western blot analysis also confirmed the correlated expression of LN-5 gamma2 and EGFR in SCC cell lines except 2 of the 5 cell lines.\nThis study suggests that coexpression of LN-5 gamma2 and EGFR is closely related to the progression and poor prognosis of esophageal SCC.","title":"Correlation between laminin-5 gamma2 chain and epidermal growth factor receptor expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.","pubmedId":"16103736"}
