Encouraged by the positive results of pyrazole derivatives as BRAF(V600E) inhibitors, we sought to design diverse novel potential BRAF(V600E) inhibitors as antitumor agents based on pyrazole skeleton. In silico and in vitro screening of our designed pyrazole derivatives has identified Hit 1 as BRAF(V600E) inhibitor. Based on its structure and through further structure modification, compound 25, which exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity with an IC(50) value of 0.16 μM for BRAF(V600E) and GI(50) value of 0.24 μM for mutant BRAF-dependent melanoma cells, was obtained. The 3D-QSAR models and the molecular docking simulation were introduced to analyze the structure-activity relationship.","title":"Identification of novel 3,5-diarylpyrazoline derivatives containing salicylamide moiety as potential anti-melanoma agents.","pubmedId":"23025996"}
