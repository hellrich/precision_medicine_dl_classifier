HPV DNA was found in 15 (19.23%) of the tumors with 12 being HPV-16, 2 HPV-18 and 1 dual infection with HPV-16 and HPV-18, giving HPV-16 prevalence of 86.7%. Higher prevalence of HPV DNA was found in males than females. There was a trend towards subjects younger than 58 years being more likely to have HPV-positive tumors.The 15 HPV-positive cases were distributed in location as 8 of 33 (24.2%) from the larynx, 4 of 29 (13.8%) from the oral cavity, and 2 of 11 (18.2%) from the pharynx and 1 of 5 (20%) from the parotid gland.\nOncogenic HPV infection was found in 19.23% of HNSCCs, with genotype 16 predominating. HPV-related HNSCC tended to occur at younger age compared to non-HPV-related HNSCC. The commonest site for HPV-associated HNSSC in Ghana is the larynx, rather than the oropharynx as reported in other studies. Host factors may be responsible for the site difference and more work is required to further elucidate this.","title":"Human papillomavirus genotypes in a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25236828"}
