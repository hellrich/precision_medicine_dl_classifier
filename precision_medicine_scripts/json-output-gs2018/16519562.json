Molecular methods are sometimes necessary to identify the unique t(12; 22)(q13;q12) translocation and differentiate clear cell sarcoma from melanoma.\nTo determine whether CD117 immunoreactivity may be useful in separating melanoma from clear cell sarcoma.\nWe identified 20 tumors listed in our surgical pathology files that were diagnosed as clear cell sarcoma or in which clear cell sarcoma was strongly considered. These were tested for the presence of the t(12;22) translocation by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction and sequencing from paraffin-embedded tissue. Tumors with a t(12;22) translocation were immunostained with an antibody to CD117 and compared with 16 similarly stained metastatic melanomas.\nTwelve tumors from 9 patients demonstrated t(12;22). No metastatic melanomas demonstrated t(12;22). None of the 12 clear cell sarcomas showed membrane or cytoplasmic staining for CD117. Conversely, 10 (63%) of 16 metastatic melanomas were, at least focally, positive for CD117; this difference was significant (P \u003c .001). Interestingly, 3 tumors in which clear cell sarcoma was initially considered as a diagnosis, but which lacked t(12;22), were also positive for CD117.\nReverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction, performed on paraffin-embedded tissue, is a useful, rapid tool for identifying the presence of t(12;22) in clear cell sarcoma. The CD117 immunoreactivity may prove useful in the differential diagnosis of deep soft tissue or visceral lesions with melanocytic differentiation; positive staining results exclude clear cell sarcoma, but are compatible with metastatic melanoma.","title":"Utility of CD117 immunoreactivity in differentiating metastatic melanoma from clear cell sarcoma.","pubmedId":"16519562"}
