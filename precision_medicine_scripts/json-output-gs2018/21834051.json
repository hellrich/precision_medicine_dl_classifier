The objective of this study was to investigate the anatomic location, subtypes, and impact of BCCs on a group of 61 individuals affected with BCNS attending a research colloquium. Fifty individuals had at least one prior BCC with 22 participants having over 100 lesions. The median age of syndrome diagnosis was 11 years and median age of first BCC was 16 years. Males had more lesions on the upper back, upper extremities, and M-zone of the face, while females had more lesions on the scalp, back, and lower extremities. Pigmented BCCs were concentrated on the neck, upper trunk, and extremities. Subjects with \u003e100 lesions showed wider anatomic distribution. The number of BCCs did not correlate with any of the other major features of the syndrome. Eighty percent of affected individuals reported great concern related to BCCs, citing the limitations and morbidity of available treatments. Vigilant surveillance, which was found to be inconsistent for participants in this study, is warranted. Future work should include development of a consensus guideline on skin examinations and strategies to optimize therapy of BCCs in this syndrome.","title":"Features of basal cell carcinomas in basal cell nevus syndrome.","pubmedId":"21834051"}
