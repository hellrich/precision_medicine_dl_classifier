An animal model of neuroblastoma, with characteristics similar to those observed clinically in children, would be beneficial to investigations into the diverse biology of this tumor. The purpose of this study was (1) to develop a model of disseminated neuroblastoma in the nude rat by intracardiac injection of neuroblastoma cells derived from cell lines with different N-myc copy numbers; (2) to investigate the effect of age on tumor growth and dissemination; and (3) to assess progression of disease radiologically and correlate with autopsy findings.\nNude rats (n \u003d 38), 5-13 weeks of age, underwent intracardiac injection of the human neuroblastoma cell lines IMR-32 with amplified N-myc oncogene and SKNSH with 1 N-myc copy. The animals were observed for at least six weeks for the development of tumor. Twelve rodents injected with IMR-32 cells underwent imaging studies including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), skeletal radiographs, and indium-111(IN-111)-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid-D-Phe1-octreotide scintigraphy. Autopsies with standardized microscopic examinations were performed on all animals.\nMost of the nude rats (95%) developed neuroblastoma following intracardiac injection of neoplastic cells. Disseminated tumor was evident in 66% of animals. Anatomic sites of neuroblastoma growth were similar to those observed clinically in children, including adrenal glands, paraspinal ganglia, bone, bone marrow, and skin, but no tumor was identified in the liver. Disseminated disease occurred in more animals injected with IMR-32 (78% of animals) than with SKNSH cells (34% of animals) (P \u003c 0.05). Tumor spread appeared to be age dependent; only rodents 5-8 weeks old at the time of injection developed disseminated disease when compared with animals 9 weeks of age or older (P \u003c 0.0001). Radioreceptor scintigraphy demonstrated only pericardial tumor; MRI identified pericardial, adrenal gland, and subcutaneous neoplasms; only skeletal radiographs detected neuroblastoma in cortical bone.\n(1) Following intracardiac injection of human neuroblastoma cell lines into nude rats, a xenograft model of disseminated disease develops that closely parallels the malignant process in children. (2) Tumor dissemination is associated with the cell line that demonstrates N-myc amplification and with young age of the recipient at the time of injection. (3) Tumor growth and dissemination may be assessed radiologically. (4) This model of human malignancy may offer an opportunity to investigate the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying tumor development and dissemination in advanced stage neuroblastoma.","title":"Disseminated neuroblastoma in the nude rat.
