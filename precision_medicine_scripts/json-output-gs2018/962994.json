The first group C received combination chemotherapy consisting of DTIC and ICRF 159. The second group (C+I) received the same chemotherapy but were also immunized with 2 X 10(7) irradiated allogeneic melanoma cells mixed with 50 mug of percutaneous BCG. The survival rates in both treatment groups C and (C+I) were not significantly different, and only minor enhancement of the chemotherapy was found in the (C+I) group. A similar pattern of tissue response was observed in both groups: lymph node, skin and, to some extent liver metastases, respond better than other sites.","title":"Clinical trial of combination chemotherapy and specific active immunotherapy in disseminated melanoma.","pubmedId":"962994"}
