At present, the generation of a fast and efficient method to evaluate the malignancy grade of glioma is required. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are currently attracting attention in oncological studies; therefore, the present study aimed to investigate novel biomarkers of glioma CSCs, in order to provide new criteria for the grading of glioma. The mRNA expression levels of CD133, (sex determining region Y)-box 2, nestin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) were detected in 15 human samples of high-malignancy glioma and 12 human samples of low-malignancy glioma in vitro. The mRNA expression levels of VEGF and PI3K were higher in the high-malignancy group, as compared with in the low-malignancy group. In conclusion, the mRNA expression levels of VEGF and PI3K in glioma CSCs may be considered a novel criteria for the grading of glioma.","title":"High expression of VEGF and PI3K in glioma stem cells provides new criteria for the grading of gliomas.","pubmedId":"26893649"}
