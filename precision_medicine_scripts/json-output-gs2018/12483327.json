We report on a 47-year-old woman who was referred to our outpatient department because of anisocoria.\nA cutaneous melanoma of the upper left arm had been excised 21 months ago with subsequent polychemotherapy for lymph node involvement. Visual acuity and intraocular tension were normal. The left iris showed a brownish, parapupillary, prominent nodule. In both eyes, multiple circumscribed whitish choroidal sub-pigment epithelial tumours were observed.\nGeneral metastasis to lymph nodes, pleura, lungs, mucosa and skin was diagnosed. The patient died 2 months later.\nMetastases of cutaneous melanoma to the iris are extremely rare. The ophthalmologist may be helpful in monitoring treatment by quantitative documentation at follow-up.","title":"Cutaneous melanoma metastasizing to the iris and choroid: a case report.","pubmedId":"12483327"}
