However, a more personalised approach to treatment, using drugs tailored to the molecular characteristics of patients\u0027 tumours, has the potential to improve patient outcomes. Drugs targeting the ErbB family of receptors have been developed, but these have had varying degrees of success in clinical practice.\nThe authors provide an overview of the ErbB receptor family with regard to OG cancers. Furthermore, they evaluate the evidence from preclinical and clinical trials of therapeutics targeting this family, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and novel agents.\nDrugs targeting the ErbB family have been evaluated in OG cancer, with a notable success story in the case of trastuzumab, although there have been disappointing failures with anti-EGFR therapy. The response to targeted treatment remains variable and further biomarker research is essential to identify patients most likely to benefit from these therapies. The treatment of OG cancer remains challenging, but new anti-HER2 therapies and combination therapies hold promise for the future.","title":"Investigational therapies targeting the ErbB family in oesophagogastric cancer.","pubmedId":"24949530"}
