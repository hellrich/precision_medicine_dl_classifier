Current drug discovery effort has, however, paradoxically ignored its criticality in melanoma cell biology and has failed to address MITF-associated intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. Here, to search the kinase targets able to circumvent the MITF-conferred intrinsic drug resistance, we used a multi-kinase inhibitor-directed chemical proteomics-based differential target affinity screen in immortalized human melanocytes carrying ectopic MITF overexpression. Through a subsequent methodical gene expression-disease stage associations and a detailed functional interrogation in molecular-genetically diverse melanoma cellular systems, we identify a mitotic Ser/Thr kinase, Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) as a potential drug target in human melanoma that successfully overcomes MITF-engendered drug resistance phenotype. Critically, assessing the long-term efficacy of the phase II clinical trial approved highly specific AURKA-inhibitor MLN-8237, we pre-emptively witness a robust MAPK signalling-mediated immediate acquired resistance program involving MITF and Cyclin D1 induction through activity and expression changes in CREB and c-Jun respectively in both the BRAF- and NRAS-mut cells. Notably, identification of these ERK-directed acquired resistance mechanisms informed combinatorial AURKA/BRAF or AURKA/MEK targeting as an intelligent therapeutic strategy in BRAF- and NRAS-mut melanomas respectively.","title":"Overcoming MITF-conferred resistance through dual AURKA/MAPK-axis targeting","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2693"}
