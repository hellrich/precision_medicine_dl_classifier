Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the HER2/neu protein receptor, is effective in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and may be useful in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using the HercepTest (Dako; Carpenteria, CA), 25% of NSCLC show 2+ or greater HER2/neu expression, but only 6% to 8% of NSCLC tumors have 3+ overexpression. Positive HER2/neu expression is most often seen in adenocarcinomas compared with squamous cell carcinomas or large cell carcinomas, and is rarely seen in small cell lung cancer. As determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, the high degree of HER2/neu gene expression and gene amplification seen in breast cancer is lower in NSCLC. Polysomy is the cause of increased HER2/neu expression in most NSCLC. Prospective clinical studies with trastuzumab in lung cancer are ongoing. Future studies in NSCLC need to include immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis to determine the method of choice for evaluating clinically relevant HER2/neu-positive tumors.","title":"HER2/neu expression in malignant lung tumors.","pubmedId":"11894014"}
