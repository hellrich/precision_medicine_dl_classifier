The earliest melanoma vaccines were formulated from autologous or allogeneic melanoma cells. Subsequently, molecularly defined vaccines made from proteins, peptides, or gangliosides were developed and, recently, DNA-based vaccines are currently being tested. Randomized trials using allogeneic melanoma cells/lysates or gangliosides have not demonstrated a clinical benefit, although in some trials, clinical benefit was seen in large subsets. On the other hand, some clinical trials indicated that vaccine therapy could be associated with a poorer survival. There are several mechanisms now identified by which melanoma cells can avoid detection by T cells, such as loss of expression of antigen or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, and tumor vascular adhesion molecules. Also, mediators of immune tolerance are now well-characterized such as regulatory T cells and inhibitory cytokines secreted by melanoma cells. Future approaches for immunizing against melanoma will have to incorporate strategies to overcome these barriers. Strategies being tested include depletion of regulatory T cells, immunization in the setting of lymphopenia, and blockade of T-cell inhibitory molecules such as CTLA-4. Once a relevant clinical response can be induced, it should be possible to develop validated immunoassays that will direct future melanoma vaccine development.","title":"Melanoma vaccines.","pubmedId":"18083375"}
