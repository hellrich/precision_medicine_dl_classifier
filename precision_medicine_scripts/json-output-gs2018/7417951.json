Two cases of spontaneous complete regression of lung metastases from transitional cell carcinoma are presented. In one case, regression occurred after a course of radiation to the primary bladder cancer, but in the other patient, lung lesions disappeared without treatment to the primary or metastatic cancers. The factors that alter the tumor-host relationship to allow spontaneous regression of cancers are unknown, but observation of these phenomena may help reveal parameters that influence tumor progression in the majority of cancer patients.","title":"Spontaneous regression of pulmonary metastases from transitional cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"7417951"}
