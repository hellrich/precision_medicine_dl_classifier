Thirty-two proteins were selected. The study consisted of the elaboration of tissue arrays with samples from resected tumour, using a semiquantitative immunohistochemical study. A prognosis analysis was done with the expression of each protein and calculation of the overall 5-year survival rate. The Wilcoxon-Gehan and Log-Rank tests were used for statistical comparisons, with p\u003c.05 being considered to indicate a significant result.\nOne hundred and forty six patients were studied. The overall 5-year survival rate was 37.7%. From 32 proteins studied, three were statistically associated with overall 5-year survival rate. RB protein expression in resected NSCLC was a positive prognostic factor (P\u003d.01). P27 (P\u003d.03) and Ki67 (P\u003d.04) expression in resected NSCLC were negative prognostic factors. There was no protein with prognostic value in epidermoid tumours.\nWe found three proteins with long-term prognostic value in the long-term in the general population and five adenocarcinoma prognostic proteins in our study of resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the future, genetic-molecular factors should be included along with anatomical (TNM staging) and clinical factors in a multidimensional lung cancer staging.","title":"[Prognostic value study of lung cancer molecular markers].","pubmedId":"19368933"}
