We conducted this study to evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with lung cancer who presented with treatment-related pulmonary toxicities and to analyze the dosage pattern of corticosteroid therapy against them.\nTo collect the baseline data from the patients with lung cancer who developed treatment-related pulmonary toxicities, we initially selected those who were prescribed corticosteroids between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. Depending on clinical and radiological diagnoses, we classified pulmonary toxicities into drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD), radiation pneumonitis, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE COPD) and others.\nWe divided total patients (n\u003d398) into four groups, and these include 88 cases (22%) of DILD, 189 cases (47%) of radiation pneumonitis, 47 cases (12%) of AE COPD and 74 cases (19%) of others. The prescribed rate of pulse or high-dose steroid was measured as 73%, 20%, 40% and 38%, respectively (P\u003c0.001). In DILD radiologic findings, the 2-month mortality was significantly higher in the patients with the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) pattern (100%) as compared with those with the non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) one (62% or 42%, respectively) (P\u003d0.032).\nThis study showed that the natural course of DILD had more unfavorable outcome requiring higher dose steroid therapy as compared with those with radiation pneumonitis or AE COPD. According to a subgroup analysis of the patients with DILD, BOOP and NSIP radiographic patterns showed more favorable outcomes.","title":"Corticosteroid therapy against treatment-related pulmonary toxicities in patients with lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25276362"}
