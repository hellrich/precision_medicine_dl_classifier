The Lauren type, the grade of differentiation and the type of growth pattern were reassessed for all early carcinomas. E-cadherin expression was examined using antibody HECD-1. Whereas E-cadherin was strongly and evenly expressed in the gastric foveolar epithelium, intestinal metaplasia and early gastric carcinomas showed a lower expression. A significant difference in E-cadherin expression was found between the Lauren types (P \u003c 0.0001). Moreover, an inverse correlation was found between E-cadherin expression and histological grade (P \u003c 0.0001). Neither a difference in E-cadherin expression between the various growth types nor an association with lymph node metastasis and overall prognosis was found.\nThe Lauren types differ in E-cadherin expression, although reduced E-cadherin expression in all probability rather reflects poor differentiation than a diffuse growth pattern \u0027genotype\u0027. Moreover, E-cadherin expression does not underlie the difference in biological behaviour of early carcinomas with different types of growth pattern. Finally, E-cadherin expression is not associated with lymph node status and 5-year survival rate, at least not in early gastric carcinomas.","title":"Loss of E-cadherin expression in early gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"10231415"}
