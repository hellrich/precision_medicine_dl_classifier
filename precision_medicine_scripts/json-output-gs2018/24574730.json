Two years and 8 mo ago, he had undergone definitive chemoradiotherapy for the lower thoracic ESCC and achieved a complete response. Chemoradiotherapy used the protocol of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group trial 9906. Approximately 8 mo later, he developed a local recurrence of the ESCC and underwent thoracoscopic salvage esophagectomy followed by reconstruction with a conduit colon graft via a subcutaneous route. Recently, a tumor of the pancreatic body was found on routine follow-up computed tomography (CT). The tumor diameter was 15 mm on CT, and the maximum standardized uptake value of the lesion was 5.49 at 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography, strongly suggesting pancreatic cancer. In addition, all tumor markers were within the reference intervals. Therefore, distal pancreatectomy was performed with the resultant histological diagnosis being confirmed as pancreatic metastasis of the ESCC. He was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, and there has been no evidence of recurrence 9 mo after the surgery. Resection of pancreatic metastasis offers a good prognosis and should be considered for solitary ESCC metastasis.
