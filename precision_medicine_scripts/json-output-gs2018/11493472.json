The circulating tumor cells did not express an antigen profile typical of any subtype of leukemia commonly observed in children. Tumor cells were CD3(-)/CD56(+); had germline TCR genes; and strongly expressed CD30, epithelial membrane antigen, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) consistent with a null cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The malignant cells contained a t(2;19)(p23;p13.1) that interrupted ALK and translocated it to the der(19). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed fusion of ALK to tropomyosin 4, an ALK fusion partner not described previously in hematologic malignancies. The clinical presentation and phenotypic features of this malignancy were not typical for ALCL because tumor cells expressed both myeloid (CD13, CD33, HLA-DR) and natural killer (NK) cell antigens. The neoplastic cells most resembled NK cells because in addition to being CD3(-)/CD56(+) with germline TCR genes, these cells were CD25(+)/CD122(+)/granzyme B(+) and possessed the functional properties of immature NK cells. The unusual clinical presentation, immunophenotype, and functional properties of these neoplastic cells suggest that this malignancy may be derived from the putative myeloid-NK precursor cell. Furthermore co-expression of NK and ALCL features supports the concept that a minority of null-ALCL may be derived from NK cells and expands the spectrum of phenotypes that can be seen in tumors produced by ALK fusion proteins.
