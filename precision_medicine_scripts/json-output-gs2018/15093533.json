The ErbB2-targeting antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) is used for treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress ErbB2. A new structural study in this issue of Cancer Cell reveals how targeting ErbB2 with another antibody, pertuzumab (Omnitarg), prevents ligand-induced dimerization of ErbB2 with the other ErbB receptors. Pertuzumab\u0027s novel mode of action might offer additional therapeutic opportunities for treatment of tumors expressing ligand-activated ErbB2.","title":"A new therapeutic antibody masks ErbB2 to its partners.","pubmedId":"15093533"}
