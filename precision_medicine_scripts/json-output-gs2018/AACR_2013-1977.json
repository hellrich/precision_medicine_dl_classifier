In the current study we tested if aberrant expression of a regulator both DNA replication and cell cycle progression, i.e. the protein phosphatase 2A subunit PR48, could be a driver of melanoma proliferation and progression. Quantitative analysis of PR48 mRNA expression revealed a strong correlation between low levels of expression and poor DMFS in a multivariate analysis (n\u003d49, p\u003d0.0007). In line with this, no or low PR48 protein expression was associated with poor overall survival in three independent samples sets of melanoma (n\u003d339, P\u003c0.001), and reduced PR48 expression correlated with increased proliferation (P\u003d0.0023). Functional analysis using over expression and knock down strategies in melanoma cell lines demonstrated that PR48 alters cdc6-cdt1 complex formation, regulates pRb phosphorylation status, and entry into the S-phase of the cycle progression. Ectopic PR48 expression decreased tumorigenicity of melanoma cells, and shRNA-mediated reduced PR48 expression increased tumor take and growth in nude mice. Our data demonstrate that PPP2R3B is a novel tumor suppressor gene in melanoma, whose loss of expression contributes increased proliferation and poor survival.","title":"The protein phosphatase 2 subunit PR48 is a novel melanoma tumor suppressor gene.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-1977"}
