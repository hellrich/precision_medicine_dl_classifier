Systemic chemotherapy is the most common approach. However the impact in overall survival and quality of life still a controversy.\nTo determine differences in overall survival and quality of life among patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer non-metastatic to the brain treated with best supportive care versus systemic chemotherapy.\nFrom February 1990 through December 1995, 78 eligible patients were admitted with the diagnosis of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Patients were divided in 2 groups: Group A (n\u003d31 - treated with best supportive care ), and Group B (n\u003d47 - treated with systemic chemotherapy).\nThe median survival time was 23 weeks (range 5 - 153 weeks) in Group A and 55 weeks (range 7.4 - 213 weeks) in Group B (p\u003d0.0018). In both groups, the incidence of admission for IV antibiotics and need of blood transfusions were similar. Patients receiving systemic chemotherapy were also stratified into those receiving mytomycin, vinblastin, and cisplatinum, n\u003d25 and those receiving other combination regimens (platinum derivatives associated with other drugs, n\u003d22). Patients receiving mytomycin, vinblastin, and cisplatinum, n\u003d25 had a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia and had their cycles delayed for longer periods of time than the other group. These patients also had a shorter median survival time (51 versus 66 weeks, p\u003d0.005).\nIn patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, non-metastatic to the brain, chemotherapy significantly increases survival compared with best supportive care.","title":"Chemotherapy versus best supportive care in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, non metastatic to the brain.","pubmedId":"11460205"}
