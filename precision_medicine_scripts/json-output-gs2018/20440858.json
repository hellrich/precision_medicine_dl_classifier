Patients with a low CEA level had a longer survival than those with a higher CEA level (15.8 mo vs 8.6 mo, P \u003c 0.001). Thirty-nine patients with low VEGFR-3 and low CEA levels had a median survival of 19.7 mo (P \u003d 0.0006). The hazard ratio for patients with a high VEGFR-3 level was 2.443 (P \u003d 0.002).\nHigh serum VEGFR-3 level is correlated significantly with poor survival. In patients with a high serum level of VEGFR-3, alternative chemotherapy regimens should be considered.","title":"Serum VEGFR-3 and survival of advanced gastric cancer patients treated with FOLFOX.","pubmedId":"20440858"}
