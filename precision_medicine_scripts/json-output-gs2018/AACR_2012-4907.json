To assess whether local application of As2O3 inhibited cholangiocarcinoma development, we assayed the in vitro and in vivo effects of the chemical on human cholangiocarcinoma cancer cells of the CC-t6 line. Materials and methods: The effect of As2O3 on CC-t6 cell survival was determined using MTT assays and the mechanism of action was evaluated by flow cytometry following Annexin V-PI staining. The in vivo effect of As2O3 on tumor volume was explored using a nude mouse xenograft model. Results: In the MTT assay, As2O3 inhibited CC-t6 cells more strongly than did than cisplatin or adriamycin. As2O3 reduced CC-t6 cell proliferation via G0/G1 phase arrest and caused dose-dependent induction of apoptosis. Injection of As2O3 into CC-t6-induced tumors in nude mice inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumor xenografts. Conclusions: As2O3 treatment dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of CC-t6 cells via G0/G1 phase arrest and retarded tumor growth in nude mice, suggesting that As2O3 may be effective in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.
