Median follow-up was 62.9 months (range 32.7-87.4). High baseline S-100beta levels were associated with positive lymph node status (p \u003d 0.02). High S-100beta levels (during therapy) showed a relation with positive lymph node status (p \u003d 0.014), number of positive lymph nodes (p \u003d 0.01), macroscopic lymph node involvement (p \u003d 0.002) and second melanoma diagnosis at study entry (p \u003d 0.001). By univariate analysis, high baseline S-100beta levels were associated with disease-free survival (p \u003d 0.004) and overall survival (p \u003d 0.0007). Similarly, high S-100beta levels during therapy were associated with disease-free survival (p \u003c 0.0001) and overall survival (p \u003c 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, high S-100beta levels during therapy (hazard ratio 1.017, 95% CI 1.008-1.026; p \u003c 0.0001) and high baseline S-100beta levels (hazard ratio 3.31, 95% CI 1.10-9.89; p \u003d 0.032) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival when compared with low levels while on therapy and low baseline S-100beta levels, respectively.\nThese results provide evidence of the clinical usefulness of serum S-100beta level determination in high-risk melanoma patients. S-100beta serum determination should be considered to be included in clinical trials that test adjuvant therapies in melanoma patients.","title":"Prognostic implications of protein S-100beta serum levels in the clinical outcome of high-risk melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"17962723"}
