We detected somatic and germline SMOmutations in NSCLC patients (A-C) and sought to characterize the mutations further. Methods: We performed tumor/blood germline sequencing of SMO mutations, familial germline mutation testing (saliva specimens), somatic mutation analysis of TCGA lung carcinoma datasets, and germline mutation analysis of the TCGA and 3 additional large cohorts (n \u003d 1933). To evaluate the functional significance of SMOP641A, HCC4011 lung cancer cells were transfected with a wild-type SMO or SMOP641A expression vector and a predictive model was created. Results: NSCLC SMOP641A in vitro activated the hedgehog pathway, and vismodegib/cyclopamine inhibited tumor cell growth. Structural modeling suggests that SMO P641A induces conformational changes and disrupts PTCH-SMO interaction leading to constitutive activation. In the NSCLC TCGA databases, somatic SMO mutations occur 1.7%. In the overall TCGA database, germline SMO P641A occurred in 0.11% of cancer patients (multiple cancers) compared with 0% in cancer-free individuals. Patient A (never-smoking SCC) had a 46% RECIST reduction within 6 weeks for 6 months on vismodegib. His 3-generation family pedigree identified germline SMOP641A in one daughter (who developed BCC early). Two additional NSCLC patients (B  germline P641A and C M525L received vismodegib; B initially stabilized but stopped vismodegib after 14 weeks for toxicity while patient C had no response. Conclusions:SMO mutations are targetable, potentially heritable, oncogenic drivers in NSCLC and other cancers. Tumor genetic profiling should consider including SMO gene, especially in never-smoking lung SCC patients. Additional studies are needed to define the role of germline/somatic SMO alterations in promoting carcinogenesis, interactions with P53 alterations, and the responsiveness of different SMO mutations to hedgehog inhibitors. Currently, the ongoing ECOG-ACRIN MATCH study (NCT02465060) treats SMO/PTCH mutated patients with vismodegib.","title":"Response of germline and somatic smoothened (SMO) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to hedgehog inhibitor vismodegib.","pubmedId":"ASCO_187278-199"}
