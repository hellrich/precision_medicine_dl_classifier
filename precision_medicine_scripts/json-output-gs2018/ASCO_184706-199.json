MyPathway (NCT02091141) is an ongoing, phase 2, multi-basket study evaluating the efficacy of targeted treatment in non-indicated tumor types harboring alterations in the HER2, BRAF, Hedgehog (Hh), or EGFR pathways. Interim results in NSCLC are presented. Methods: Patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC and alterations in the HER2 (amplification and/or mutation), BRAF (V600E or other mutations), Hh (SMO or PTCH-1 mutations), or EGFR (mutations other than known activating mutations) pathways received standard doses of pertuzumab + trastuzumab, vemurafenib, vismodegib, or erlotinib, respectively, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The HER2, BRAF, and Hh cohorts are included in this analysis. The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR, defined as complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) by RECIST v1.1. Results: As of November 30, 2016, 61 patients with NSCLC and HER2 (n \u003d 36), BRAF (n \u003d 22), or Hh (n \u003d 3) alterations have been treated (median age of 64 years, 49% male, 85% adenocarcinoma, and a median of 2 previous regimens). Median treatment duration was 1.8 (range, 021.4) months. Efficacy in the 55 patients with the minimum required follow-up for efficacy analysis is summarized in the table. Conclusions: Targeted therapy is active in patients with previously treated NSCLC harboring BRAF V600E mutations or HER2 alterations (amplifications and/or mutations). These cohorts have been expanded as MyPathway accrual continues. Additional efficacy data and details regarding molecular alterations will be presented.
