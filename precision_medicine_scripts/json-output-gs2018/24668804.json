These mutations confer a neomorphic activity of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) production, and 2-HG has previously been implicated as an oncometabolite. Inhibitors of mutant IDH1 can potentially be used to treat these diseases. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of a newly discovered inhibitor, ML309, using biochemical, cellular, and biophysical approaches. Substrate binding and product inhibition studies helped to further elucidate the IDH1 R132H catalytic cycle. This rapidly equilibrating inhibitor is active in both biochemical and cellular assays. The (+) isomer is active (IC50 \u003d 68 nm), whereas the (-) isomer is over 400-fold less active (IC50 \u003d 29 μm) for IDH1 R132H inhibition. IDH1 R132C was similarly inhibited by (+)-ML309. WT IDH1 was largely unaffected by (+)-ML309 (IC50 \u003e36 μm). Kinetic analyses combined with microscale thermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance indicate that this reversible inhibitor binds to IDH1 R132H competitively with respect to α-ketoglutarate and uncompetitively with respect to NADPH. A reaction scheme for IDH1 R132H inhibition by ML309 is proposed in which ML309 binds to IDH1 R132H after formation of the IDH1 R132H NADPH complex. ML309 was also able to inhibit 2-HG production in a glioblastoma cell line (IC50 \u003d 250 nm) and had minimal cytotoxicity. In the presence of racemic ML309, 2-HG levels drop rapidly. This drop was sustained until 48 h, at which point the compound was washed out and 2-HG levels recovered.
