Recent clinical success with antibody-based cancer therapeutics has led to an upsurge in the development of these agents. Antibodies directed against FLT3 represent a promising approach for the treatment of human leukemia. We discuss some basic aspects of antibody-based cancer therapeutics, including their mechanisms of action, with a focus on recent progress in the generation and development of anti-FLT3 antibodies as well as their therapeutic potentials in the treatment of human hematologic malignancies.","title":"FLT3 antibody-based therapeutics for leukemia therapy.","pubmedId":"16146840"}
