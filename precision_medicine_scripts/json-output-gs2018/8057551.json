A 68-year-old male was treated by subtotal esophagectomy and esophagogastrostomy through retrosternal route. One year after the operation he experienced dysphagia and anastomotic recurrence was detected by an upper gastrointestinal series and fiberscopy. He was admitted to our hospital for radiation therapy. The response was poor and dysphagia wasn\u0027t disappeared after radiation therapy at a dose of 10,200 rad. He was consulted to our surgical department for operative therapy. Cervical esophagectomy, partial resection of gastric tube and free jejunal transplantation for the reconstruction were performed. He had been eating anything of food after the operation.","title":"[A case of free jejunal graft for anastomotic recurrence after subtotal esophagectomy].","pubmedId":"8057551"}
