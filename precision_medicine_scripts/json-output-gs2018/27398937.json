BRAFV600E mutation has been identified in pediatric LGG; however, the use of BRAF inhibitors in infants has never been reported. A 2-month-old with V600E mutant hypothalamic/chiasmatic glioma progressed on chemotherapy resulting in profound visual loss, massive ascites, and diencephalic syndrome. Initiation of dabrafenib resulted in rapid and sustained disappearance of clinical symptoms and a profound sustained cytoreduction. BRAF inhibition was safely tolerated with dramatic clinicoradiological response, suggesting early targeted therapy is a viable option in infants with LGG. A re-evaluation of current management paradigms in this population is warranted to leverage the potential benefit of upfront-targeted therapies.
