Several reports have confirmed associations of other RAS mutations with resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. However, the impact of BRAF and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy remains controversial. Little is known about the frequencies and clinicopathological features of these mutations, as well as the therapeutic effects of anti-EGFR therapy in mCRC patients with these mutations, especially in the Asian population.\nIn this retrospective observational study, frequencies and clinicopathological features of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were evaluated in patients with mCRC. Among patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy, objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated according to gene status.\nAmong 264 patients, mutations in KRAS exon 2, KRAS exons 3 or 4, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA were detected in 34.1%, 3.8%, 4.2%, 5.4% and 6.4%, respectively. Thus, a total of 12.1% of patients without KRAS exon 2 mutations had other RAS mutations. Primary rectal tumors tended to be more frequently observed in RAS mutant tumors. BRAF mutations were more frequently observed with right-sided colon, poorly differentiated or mucinous adenocarcinoma, and peritoneal metastasis. Among the 66 patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumors treated with anti-EGFR agents, PFS (5.8 vs. 2.2 months) and OS (17.7 vs. 5.2 months) were significantly better in patients with all wild-type tumors (n \u003d 56) than in those with any of the mutations (n \u003d 10). The response rate also tended to be better with all wild-type tumors (26.8 vs. 0%).\nOther RAS and BRAF mutations were observed in KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumors, which were associated with some clinicopathological features and resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in our patient cohort.","title":"A retrospective observational study of clinicopathological features of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"25886136"}
