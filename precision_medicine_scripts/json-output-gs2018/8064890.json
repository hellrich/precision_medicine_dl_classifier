The MDM2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13-14), and it encodes for a nuclear protein (Mdm2) of 90 kd of molecular mass. Genetic alterations in the TP53 gene have been reported as frequent events in bladder cancer and are associated with disease progression. The MDM2 gene has been shown to be amplified and overexpressed in sarcomas; however, these changes have not yet been analyzed in neoplastic lesions of the urinary bladder.\nWe undertook the present study in order to determine the frequency of MDM2 and TP53 abnormalities in bladder tumors, as well as to examine the clinical relevance of identifying their altered patterns of expression in patients affected with bladder cancer.\nWe analyzed a cohort of 87 patients affected by bladder tumors. Altered patterns of expression of Mdm2 proteins were determined using an immunohistochemical assay with monoclonal antibody 2A10, and MDM2 gene amplifications were studied by Southern blotting. Mutant p53 proteins were identified using monoclonal antibody PAb1801. The presence of intragenic mutations in the TP53 gene were assessed utilizing single-strand conformation polymorphism and further characterized by sequencing. Associations were assessed statistically by the two-tailed Fisher\u0027s exact test.\nTwenty-six of 87 cases had abnormally high levels of Mdm2 proteins; however, only one case showed an MDM2 amplification. Thirty-six of 87 cases displayed p53 nuclear overexpression. Sixteen cases had abnormally high levels of both Mdm2 and p53 proteins. There was a strong statistical association between Mdm2 and p53 overexpression (Fisher\u0027s exact test: P \u003d .018). Moreover, there was a striking association between Mdm2 overexpression and low-stage, low-grade bladder tumors (Fisher\u0027s exact test: P \u003d .0005).\nThe results suggest that aberrant Mdm2 and p53 phenotypes are frequent events in bladder cancer and may be involved in tumorigenesis or tumor progression in urothelial neoplasias.\nThis study is the first to report altered patterns of MDM2 expression in human bladder tumors and demonstrates that aberrant Mdm2 and p53 phenotypes may be important diagnostic and prognostic markers in patients affected by bladder cancer.","title":"Altered patterns of MDM2 and TP53 expression in human bladder cancer.","pubmedId":"8064890"}
