Discoidin domain receptor (DDR1) and Drosophila dishevelled protein (DVL1) were recently suggested to differentiate IDC from ILC.\nTo assess the expression of DDR1 and DVL1 and their association with histological type, grading and hormonal status of IDC and ILC.\nThis cross sectional study was conducted on IDC and ILC breast tumours. Tumours were immunohistochemically stained for (DDR1) and (DVL1) as well as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and C-erbB2 receptor. Demographic data including age and ethnicity were obtained from patient records.\nA total of 51 cases (30 IDCs and 21 ILCs) were assessed. DDR1 and DVL1 expression was not significantly associated with histological type (p\u003d0.57 and p\u003d0.66 respectively). There was no association between DDR1 and DVL1 expression and tumour grade (p\u003d0.32 and p\u003d1.00 respectively), ER (p\u003d0.62 and 0.50 respectively), PR (p\u003d0.38 and p\u003d0.63 respectively) and C-erbB2 expression (p\u003d0.19 and p\u003d0.33 respectively) in IDC. There was no association between DDR1 and DVL1 expression and tumour grade (p\u003d0.52 and p\u003d0.33 respectively), ER (p\u003d0.06 and p\u003d0.76 respectively), PR (p\u003d0.61 and p\u003d0.43 respectively) and C-erbB2 expression (p\u003d0.58 and p\u003d0.76 respectively) in ILC.\nThis study revealed that DDR1 and DVL1 are present in both IDC and ILC regardless of the tumour differentiation. More studies are needed to assess the potential of these two proteins in distinguishing IDC from ILC in breast tumours.","title":"Expression of DDR1 and DVL1 in invasive ductal and lobular breast carcinoma does not correlate with histological type, grade and hormone receptor status.","pubmedId":"25824769"}
