A total of ninety-seven EBC patients who underwent standard surgery were investigated. PD-1/PD-L1, PTEN expression and the density of CD3+ TILs, CD8+ TILs, and CD163+ macrophages were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis. The association between the immunologic factors and clinical outcome was statistically analyzed. The density of CD3+TILs, CD8+TILs, CD163+ macrophages and non-expression of PTEN was significantly higher in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). CD8+TIL density and CD8+/ PD-L1+ expression were predictive factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Her2-positive patients with PTEN expression and luminal/Her2-negative patients without PD-L1 expression had significantly longer OS, compared to patients without PTEN expression (p\u003d0.049) and with PD-L1 expression (p\u003d0.036), respectively. Furthermore, the patients with PD-L1+/CD8+ expression had worse median PFS (p \u003d 0.022) and median OS (p \u003d 0.037), compared with patients without PD-L1+/CD8+ expression.Â This study showed that CD3+ TILs, CD8+ TILs, and CD163+ macrophages were shown to infiltrate the tumor area of EBC. In particular, TNBC had a higher rate of TIL infiltration within the tumor environment. PTEN expression and lack of PD-L1 expression were associated with favorable survival in Her2-positive and luminal/Her2-negative EBC patients, respectively. The PD-L1 expression combined with CD8+ density was significantly associated with an aggressive clinical outcome. This article is protected by copyright.
