Based on a review of similar lesions presenting in the head and neck, our treatment plan entailed pelvic exenteration followed by radiation therapy. Whether adenoid cystic carcinoma of Cowper\u0027s gland behaves as aggressively as it does in the head and neck remains unclear. However, in view of the extensive local invasion in our patient and a previously successful outcome, a combined surgical and radiation approach appears to be the most appropriate therapy.","title":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of Cowper\u0027s gland.","pubmedId":"1311394"}
