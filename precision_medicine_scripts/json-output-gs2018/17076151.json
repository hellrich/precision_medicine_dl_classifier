Since antitumoral immunity was described, immunotherapy has shown promising results as an adjunctive treatment in various cancer types. Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been identified and shown to stimulate selective T-cell-mediated antitumoral immune response. This article briefly reviews the work done in the field of immunotherapy of HNSCC in the past few years. It gives confidence that immunotherapy may play an important role in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Among various TAAs, the family of cancer testis antigens (CTAs) may be promising candidates for specific immune therapy in HNSCC. Ongoing studies will confirm whether CTAs may generate an immune response in clinical vaccine trials.","title":"[Immunotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma].","pubmedId":"17076151"}
