Specific chromosomal abnormalities are associated with prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but chromosome abnormalities have not been evaluated for prognostic value in pediatric ALCL. For Children\u0027s Cancer Group protocol CCG-E-08 Etiologic Study of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Childhood, three patients were enrolled with cytogenetic analysis of ALCL and simultaneously enrolled on treatment protocol CCG-552. Pathology material and karyotypes at initial diagnosis underwent central review. Demographics included ages of 9, 12, and 14 years, and a male/female ratio of 1:2. All patients had advanced disease (stage III). Disease progressed or relapsed in two patients, and one died. Chromosomal abnormalities, including t(2;5)(p23;q35), the ALK/NPM fusion gene, and complex karyotypes with multiple additional abnormalities, were identified in all three patients. In two patients with progressive disease or relapse, additional chromosomal abnormalities at 1q21 and 10q24, possibly involving MCL1 and HOX11/TCL3, respectively, may have contributed to worse outcome. Pediatric ALCL cases frequently have complex karyotypes and usually involve ALK/NPM translocations in this limited study. Additional chromosome abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of ALCL. Further studies are warranted in larger cohorts of children and adolescents with ALCL.","title":"Complex secondary chromosome abnormalities in advanced stage anaplastic large cell lymphoma of children and adolescents: a report from CCG-E08.","pubmedId":"17116485"}
