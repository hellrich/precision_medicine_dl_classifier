Enasidenib treatment (Tx) can result in IDH-inhibitor-associated differentiation syndrome (IDH-DS), with manifestations akin to retinoic acid syndrome seen during acute promyelocytic leukemia Tx. Methods: A phase 1 dose-escalation/expansion study (N \u003d 239) (NCT01915498) included 109 pts with relapsed/refractory AML who received enasidenib 100 mg /day. An independent Differentiation Syndrome Review Committee (DSRC) was formed to review potential IDH-DS cases. The DSRC identified and agreed on signs and symptoms possibly characteristic of IDH-DS, including fever, lung infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, rapid weight gain, edema, and azotemia. Of the 109 pts, the DSRC identified and retrospectively reviewed 27 cases (8 investigator reported IDH-DS cases and 19 cases suggestive of IDH-DS) to determine consistency with IDH-DS. Results: The DSRC found 13 of the 27 cases to be consistent with IDH-DS (11.9% of 109 pts). Median time to onset was 30 days (range 7-116). Manifestations of IDH-DS in \u003e 2 pts were dyspnea (n \u003d 10), pyrexia (9), lung infiltrates (8), pleural effusion (5), and kidney injury (3). IDH-DS was effectively managed with systemic corticosteroids in 12/13 cases. Leukocytosis accompanied 4 cases and hydroxyurea was used for cytoreduction. Enasidenib was interrupted for 9 pts (median 7 days) but dose reductions or discontinuation were not required. Six of 13 pts had clinical responses (2 complete remission [CR], 2 CR with incomplete hematologic recovery, 1 partial remission, 1 morphologic leukemia-free state), 6 had stable disease and 1 had progressive disease. Conclusions: Systemic corticosteroids, close hemodynamic management, and hydroxyurea (in the presence of leukocytosis) are effective management strategies, should be administered promptly when IDH-DS is suspected, and continued until improvement. Enasidenib interruption can be considered if initial intervention is unsuccessful. IDH-DS represents a novel clinical finding in mIDH2 AML treated with enasidenib, and is likely due to its suggested mechanism of action, differentiation.
