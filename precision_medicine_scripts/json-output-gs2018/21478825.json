Melanomas with demonstrated activating mutations in KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) may benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Currently, the limited data regarding KIT mutational status in ocular melanoma suggest that activating mutations are extremely rare. PDGFRA mutational status in ocular melanoma has not been determined. Seventy-five ocular melanomas (53 choroidal, 6 iris, 11 ciliary body, and 5 conjuctival) were selected from the files of the Department of Ophthalmology. High-resolution melting curve analysis and sequencing were performed to detect mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18. Results of mutational analysis were correlated with anatomical site and KIT (CD117) immunohistochemistry. Eight of 75 (11%) ocular melanomas contained mutations in either the KIT or PDGFRA gene. Five of 53 (9%) choroidal melanomas were associated with mutations (KIT exon 11\u003d3; KIT exon 17\u003d1; PDGFRA intron 18\u003d1). Two of six (33%) iris melanomas and a single (9%) ciliary body melanoma harbored KIT exon 11 mutations. No mutations were identified in conjunctival melanomas. The distribution of KIT and PDGFRA mutations by ocular melanoma anatomical site did not reach statistical significance (P\u003d0.393) CD117 positivity was not predictive of KIT mutational status as only 6 of 58 (10%) CD177-positive tumors harbored KIT mutations. In addition, a KIT exon 17 mutation was identified in one CD117-negative tumor. KIT and PDGFRA mutations do occur in ocular melanomas at a frequency (11%) that is similar to acral and mucosal melanomas. Limited correlation of CD117 positivity with mutational status suggests that all ocular melanomas should undergo mutational analysis to determine if imatinib therapy is appropriate.","title":"KIT mutations in ocular melanoma: frequency and anatomic distribution.","pubmedId":"21478825"}
