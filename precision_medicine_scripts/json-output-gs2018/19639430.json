The elderly group included patients who underwent surgery and/or reoperation and those managed nonoperatively. All patients were treated during an 11-year period from 1994 to 2004 at the Cancer Institute Hospital.\nThe elderly patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma had a significantly worse cumulative 5-year survival rate than the young patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (92% vs 100%: P \u003d 0.03). However, there was no significant difference in the survival of patients with low-risk tumors between the two age groups. The cumulative 2-year survival rate of elderly patients with a high-risk tumor was significantly lower in patients not treated with surgery than in those treated surgically (80% vs 100%: P \u003d 0.02). Quality of life (QOL) was severely impaired in 67% and 6% of the nonoperated and operated patients, respectively.\nThese results suggest that surgery for thyroid cancer increases the survival rate and promotes the QOL of elderly patients if they are well enough to tolerate the procedure.","title":"Indications for thyroid cancer surgery in elderly patients.","pubmedId":"19639430"}
