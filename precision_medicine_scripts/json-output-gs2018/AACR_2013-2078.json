To study the efficacy of a c-Met and BRAF inhibitor combination, two cell lines were selected: MU, which is positive for the BRAF activating V600E mutation, and MM-RU, which is negative for this mutation. c-Met inhibitor SU11274 resistant cell lines were generated by exposing these parental lines to increasing concentrations of SU11274, until the final IC50 concentrations of resistant cells were 6-8 fold higher than those of parental lines. When c-Met and BRAF kinase inhibitors SU11274 (0.075M) and vemurafenib (0.15M) were administered individually and in combination, both drugs were able to significantly (p\u003c0.01) synergize their inhibitory effects in MU parental and SU11274 resistant cells (60% and 58%, respectively) compared to their individual treatments (MUP 41%/5% and MUR 46%/0% vemurafenib/SU11274, respectively). When cells from the RU line were treated with varying concentrations of tivantinib, a c-Met inhibitor currently in clinical trials (0.05M - 0.3M) and Vemurafenib (0.025M - 0.15M), both parental and resistant cells did not show any synergism in combination. Conversely, MU parental and SU11274 resistant cells again showed synergism (27% and 22% respectively as determined by ANOVA analysis, p\u003c0.01) when treated with 0.15M vemurafenib and 0.075M tivantinib in combination. However, minimal inhibition (MUP 9%/4% and MUR 0%/4% vemurafenib/tivantinib) was seen in MU cell lines in response to vemurafenib and tivantinib when given individually. This data suggests that using a vemurafenib and c-Met inhibitor combination therapy on BRAF mutant and c-Met expressing tumors would greatly benefit melanoma patients, even those exhibiting c-Met TKI resistance.To study the effects of an oral/bioavailable c-Met TKI, JNJ, and to determine if c-Met inhibitors could be delivered systemically and targeted to the tumor, the therapeutic effects of JNJ were tested in vivo on MM-RU melanoma cells which produce HGF. Five million MM-RU melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously into the hind flanks of nude mice. When tumors were palpable, they were treated with 20mg/kg JNJ or vehicle (20% Captisol, 0.25% PVP in 0.1N HCL) for 3 weeks. We found that JNJ significantly reduced tumor size by 6 fold (123.77 +/- 56.66mm2 and 16.67 +/-11.19mm2 p\u003c0.03) compared to vehicle. Treatment with JNJ also resulted in 80% +/- 2.35% reduction in blood vessels as seen by CD31 staining and decreased VEGF expression and increased TSP1 expression as seen by immunohistochemistry in MM-RU indicating that inhibition of vessel formation may be one of the mechanisms by which JNJ inhibits tumor growth. Our data indicates that JNJ could be a promising therapeutic option for treating HGF producing melanoma.","title":"Synergistic effects of c-Met and BRAF inhibitors and role of c-Met as a therapeutic target in human melanoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-2078"}
