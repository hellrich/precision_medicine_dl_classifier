Before fusion, melanoma cells were stably transfected with green fluorescent marker protein (GFP) and neomycin resistance gene (neo(+)). Stably growing hybrid antigen-presenting cells (HAPC) expressing HLA-DR and HLA-A2 (or HLA-A30/31), and melanoma-associated antigens (MART-1, gp100) were selected by a double strategy of immunomagnetic MACS and neomycin selection. Fusion efficiency ranged between 3% and 18% (mean: 8.0+/-4.7%) as defined by simultaneous GFP and HLA-A2 detection. Expression of melanoma-associated antigens (MART-1, gp100) in hybrid cells was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). HLA-restricted antigen-specific presentation of melanoma antigens was demonstrated by killing of semi-allogenic HAPC by HLA-A2-restricted MART-1 or gp100-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones. HLA restriction and antigen specificity were confirmed by inhibition of specific cytotoxicity by anti-HLA antibodies and cold target inhibition. During long-term (42-70 days) neomycin selection of HAPC, a drastic loss of antigen-presenting cell (APC)-derived determinants (e.g. HLA-DR, HLA-A2) was observed which, however, could be \"reversed\" by repeated MACSorting (days 10, 21 and 49). Our method allows the generation of semi-allogenic HAPC that constitutively proliferate in vitro. This opens the possibility of establishing a number of tumor-APC hybrids expressing defined HLA haplotypes and tumor antigens, of investigating their specific properties (e.g. antigen processing), and testing their diagnostic or therapeutic potential.","title":"Cell fusion: an approach to generating constitutively proliferating human tumor antigen-presenting cells.","pubmedId":"12192536"}
