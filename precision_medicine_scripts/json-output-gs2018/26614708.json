We analyzed a molecular profiling database for the distribution of biomarkers predictive of chemotherapies and targeted agents.\nSeven hundred thirty-five patients with advanced HNSCC (88 with known human papillomavirus [HPV] status), were profiled using multiple platforms (gene sequencing, gene copy number, and protein expression).\nAmong the entire patient population studied, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was the protein most often overexpressed (90%), TP53 gene most often mutated (41%), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3CA) most often amplified (40%; n \u003d 5). With the exception of TP53 mutation, other biomarker frequencies were not significantly different among HPV-positive or HPV-negative patients. PIK3CA mutations and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss are frequent events, independent of HPV status. The immune response-modulating programmed cell death 1 (PD1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) axis was active across sites, stages, and HPV status.\nMolecular profiling utilizing multiple platforms provides a range of therapy options beyond standard of care. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
