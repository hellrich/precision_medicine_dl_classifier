This study investigated the impact of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA and TP53 status on outcome of elderly metastatic colorectal cancer patients enrolled in TEGAFOX-E (cetuximab, oxaliplatin and oral uracil/ftorafur--UFT) phase II study. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled and all were evaluable for safety and activity. Twenty-three specimens were analysed for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PI3KCA and TP53 mutational status by means of polymerase chain reaction and correlated with objective response, progression-free survival and overall survival. An evident increase of response rate was noted in KRAS/NRAS wild-type cases (70 versus 33%, P \u003d 0.198). KRAS/NRAS wild-type status showed an independent association with a longer progression-free survival (44 versus 9 weeks, P \u003d 0.009). Considering the combined assessment of BRAF, KRAS/NRAS and TP53, a trend towards an increase of response rate was noted in patients without mutations (83 versus 33%, P \u003d 0.063). Moreover, patients with all wild-type genes had significantly longer progression-free survival than patients with any mutation (48 versus 10 weeks, P \u003d 0.007). As a single biomarker, only KRAS/NRAS proteins maintained an independent value for outcome prediction. Patients with KRAS/NRAS, BRAF and TP53 wild-type tumours could derive the maximal benefits from treatment with cetuximab, oxaliplatin and UFT.","title":"Lack of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and TP53 mutations improves outcome of elderly metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab, oxaliplatin and UFT.","pubmedId":"23821376"}
