Loss of function and excitation of brain nerves i.e. sensory loss, paralysis and pain in the head-and-neck region are specific features in base of skull tumours: meningioma, glomus tumours, vestibular Schwannoma, meningeal metastases by breast cancer, melanoma, and leukaemia, melanoma. In the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumours, special attention is required for rare complications in the head and neck region.","title":"[Diagnosis and treatment of brain tumours].","pubmedId":"19438077"}
