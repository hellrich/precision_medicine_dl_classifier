C-met is HGF\u0027s high affinity receptor.\nThe aim of the study was to assess the correlations between c-met expression and clinic-pathological factors in breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR, c-met) expressions in homogenous group of breast cancer patients.\nTumor samples were collected from 302 patients with breast carcinoma treated with primary surgery. We have assessed the percentage of tumor cells with c-met expression, the intensity of reaction and the ratio of these two factors-immunoreactivity according to the Remmele score.\nWe have observed no correlations between HGFR immunoreactivities and clinical parameters (tumor size, grade, axillary lymph node status, age). In 5-year observation we have found prognostic value of assessing c-met immunoreactivity in primary tumor.\nOur study has revealed prognostic value of c-met. Unlike in other authors\u0027 studies, our patients\u0027 group is very homogenous which might contribute to obtained results.","title":"Prognostic role of c-met expression in breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"24376976"}
