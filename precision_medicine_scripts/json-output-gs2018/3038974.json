Ten cases from the files of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology were studied. Seven of the 10 cases recurred after initial surgery. The interval between surgery and recurrence ranged from 4 months to 20 years. In one case there was metastasis to lung and pleura. Histologically, cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma is indistinguishable from adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary gland. The diagnostic histologic features and the differentiation of adenoid cystic carcinoma from other cutaneous neoplasms are discussed.","title":"Primary cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"3038974"}
