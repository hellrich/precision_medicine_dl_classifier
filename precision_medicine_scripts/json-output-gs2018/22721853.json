In the present study, ERLO was entrapped in lipid nanocarriers by means of reverse micellar incorporation. This study aims to optimize the formulation of ERLO-loaded nanoparticles. Surfactants forming reverse micelles in Labrafac(®) were filled with ERLO under various conditions. Both the initial amount of drug incubated with reverse micelles and the surfactant composing the reverse micelles are crucial parameters for reverse micelle capacity to load ERLO. The optimal loading system for reverse micelles was obtained with a mix of sorbitan trioleate (Span(®) 85) and Labrafac(®) oil at a 1:1 (w/w) ratio. Reverse micelle composition influenced the nanocarrier\u0027s hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. In lipid nanoparticles formulated by using the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method, ERLO entrapment efficiency was around 56%. In vitro, the efficacy of ERLO-loaded nanocarriers on BxPC-3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells was comparable to free ERLO, and led to a cell death rate of around 40%.","title":"Design, optimization and in vitro evaluation of reverse micelle-loaded lipid nanocarriers containing erlotinib hydrochloride.","pubmedId":"22721853"}
