Demographic, reproductive and lifestyle information was collected either in person or by mailed questionnaires. Case-only odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, and study origin.\nCompared with luminal A cases, luminal B cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P \u003d 0.0001) and were less likely to consume alcohol (OR \u003d 0.74, 95% CI \u003d 0.56 to 0.98), use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (OR \u003d 0.66, 95% CI \u003d 0.46 to 0.94), and oral contraceptives (OR \u003d 0.73, 95% CI \u003d 0.55 to 0.96). Compared with luminal A cases, triple-negative cases tended to be younger at diagnosis (P \u003c or \u003d 0.0001) and African American (OR \u003d 3.14, 95% CI \u003d 2.12 to 4.16), were more likely to have not breastfed if they had parity greater than or equal to three (OR \u003d 1.68, 95% CI \u003d 1.00 to 2.81), and were more likely to be overweight (OR \u003d 1.82, 95% CI \u003d 1.03 to 3.24) or obese (OR \u003d 1.97, 95% CI \u003d 1.03 to 3.77) if premenopausal. Her2-overexpressing cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P \u003d 0.03) and Hispanic (OR \u003d 2.19, 95% CI \u003d 1.16 to 4.13) or Asian (OR \u003d 2.02, 95% CI \u003d 1.05 to 3.88), and less likely to use HRT (OR \u003d 0.45, 95% CI \u003d 0.26 to 0.79).\nThese observations suggest that investigators should consider tumor heterogeneity in associations with traditional breast cancer risk factors. Important modifiable lifestyle factors that may be related to the development of a specific tumor subtype, but not all subtypes, include obesity, breastfeeding, and alcohol consumption. Future work that will further categorize triple-negative cases into basal and non-basal tumors may help to elucidate these associations further.","title":"Epidemiology of breast cancer subtypes in two prospective cohort studies of breast cancer survivors.","pubmedId":"19463150"}
