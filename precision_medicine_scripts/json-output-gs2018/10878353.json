In mice, DC from these separate hemopoietic lineages differ by their surface expression of CD8 alpha. We undertook a comparative study of CD8 alpha+ (CD11blow; lymphoid-related) and CD8 alpha- (CD11bhigh; myeloid) DC isolated from mouse liver. CD8 alpha+ and CD8 alpha- DC each constituted \u003c/\u003d1.0% of the freshly isolated, normal nonparenchymal cells (NPC). Both populations were enriched 10-15% by overnight culture and metrizamide density centrifugation. Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) potently induced equal expansion of both subsets in vivo. Tissue-resident CD8 alpha+ DC, freshly isolated from Flt3L-treated mice, existed primarily as immature cells (CD11c+, CD11blow, CD40-/low, CD80low, CD86low, MHC class IIlow), consistent with previous observations regarding bulk DC freshly isolated from nonlymphoid tissues. Following overnight culture in GM-CSF, CD8 alpha+ DC underwent phenotypic and functional maturation equivalent to that observed for CD8 alpha- DC. CD95 ligand (FasL) mRNA was detected in both immature and mature DC of each subset. In vitro analysis confirmed that flow-sorted, mature CD8 alpha+ and CD8 alpha- DC were strong and equally efficient stimulators of allogeneic T cell proliferation in primary MLR. Both immunohistochemical and genomic DNA analysis revealed that in vivo, sorted CD8 alpha+ DC trafficked from s.c. sites to T cell areas of allogeneic lymphoid tissue and were equally efficient at priming naive T cells compared with CD8 alpha- DC. This is the first comparative study of lymphoid-related DC isolated from nonlymphoid tissue.","title":"Phenotypic and functional characterization of mouse hepatic CD8 alpha+ lymphoid-related dendritic cells.","pubmedId":"10878353"}
