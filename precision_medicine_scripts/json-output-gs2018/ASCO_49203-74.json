However, molecular determinants of sensitivity/resistance to pharmacological MEK inhibitors need to be identified. Methods: MEK and mTOR were inhibited using PD0325901 (PD) and temsirolimus (Tem), respectively, in melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. VEGF production was assessed by ELISA. Cell growth/proliferation, apoptosis, and expression/phosphorylation of pathway elements were assessed by MTT, flow cytometry, and Western blot (WB). Specific pathway elements were modulated by transduction with constitutively active (CA) or dominant negative (DN) constructs or by RNA interference. Results: In melanoma and AML models, PD and Tem had synergistic inhibitory effects on cell growth and VEGF production at suboptimal concentrations, but became frankly antagonistic at higher PD concentrations, suggesting competition for the same downstream target(s). PD time- and dose-dependently inhibited AKT, mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation; consistently, PD increased PTEN expression in multiple tumor models. PTEN upregulation was dependent upon PD-mediated downregulation of c-jun, which relieved transcriptional PTEN suppression. These effects were not due to off-target activities of PD, as they were also observed using DN-MEK-1. Moreover, c-jun/PTEN regulation by ERK appears to be a general phenomenon, as it could be reproduced in NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing CA-ERK or c-jun, both of which resulted in PTEN downregulation. PTEN upregulation was central to the therapeutic effects of PD in melanoma, since M14 cells expressing DN-PTEN were more resistant to PD-mediated inhibition of cell growth and VEGF production. Conclusions: These results identify a novel cross-talk pathway that, through ERK-dependent upregulation of c-jun, leads to suppression of PTEN expression and concomitant activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This notion may be helpful in selecting appropriate cellular contexts for the design of rational therapeutic strategies based on the single/combined inhibition of these two pathways.","title":"Effect of a novel cross-talk mechanism on the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in melanoma: Role of ERK-mediated suppression of PTEN expression.","pubmedId":"ASCO_49203-74"}
