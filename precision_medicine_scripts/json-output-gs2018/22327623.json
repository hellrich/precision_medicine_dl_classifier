In addition, we discovered previously unidentified kinase fusions that may be promising for molecular-targeted therapy, kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B)-ret proto-oncogene (RET) and coiled-coil domain containing 6 (CCDC6)-RET, in 14 adenocarcinomas. A multivariate analysis of 1,116 adenocarcinomas containing these 71 kinase-fusion-positive adenocarcinomas identified four independent factors that are indicators of poor prognosis: age â‰¥ 50 years, male sex, high pathological stage and negative kinase-fusion status.","title":"RET, ROS1 and ALK fusions in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22327623"}
