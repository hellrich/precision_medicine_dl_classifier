The pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma in PSC including the role of chronic inflammation and oncogenic mutations will be discussed. Cholangiocarcinoma is a leading cause of death in PSC and the prognosis even after liver transplantation is poor, with a median survival after cancer diagnosis of 5 months. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify PSC patients who are at risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma in order to transplant them before cancer has developed.","title":"Hepatobiliary and extra-hepatic malignancies in primary sclerosing cholangitis.","pubmedId":"11492973"}
