The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes could reflect an in situ immune reaction directed to the malignant cells. The characterization of T-cell receptor (TCR) expressed by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is one way to precisely analyze these local T-cell responses. In this study, we have assessed the TCR alpha/beta variability in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from a subcutaneous metastasis of a melanoma patient. Using the anchored-polymerase chain reaction 268 TCR alpha and 266 TCR beta chain transcripts have been cloned and sequenced. Their analysis shows that the T-cell infiltrate is extremely diverse, with no preferential TCR gene segment usage.","title":"Analysis of T-cell receptor alpha/beta variability in lymphocytes infiltrating a melanoma metastasis.","pubmedId":"1324789"}
