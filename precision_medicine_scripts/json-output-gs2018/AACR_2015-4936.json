Accumulated evidences suggest that intratumoral hypoxia, a characteristic of fast-growing solid tumors, promotes cancer cell motile and invasive abilities. In this study, we investigated the effects and interaction of hypoxia, surrounding fibroblasts, and p16 expression on the migration and invasion of breast cancer (BCa) cells MDA-MB-231, JygMC(A) and LM2. We found that hypoxia promoted BCa cell migration and invasion, and cocultured MEF fibroblasts stimulated invasiveness of BCa cells. Moreover, by using a Tet-on inducible system, we found that p16 is capable of inhibiting hypoxia-induced BCa cell migration and invasion (e.g., 36.0% and 85.8% inhibition on migration and invasion, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 cells), and suppressing cocultured fibroblast-stimulated invasiveness of BCa cells. These results suggest that p16, in addition to its well-known anti-tumor proliferation function, has novel anti-cancer properties capable of suppressing hypoxia-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion. This study may provide important validation for p16-mediated cancer therapy either by gene therapy or pharmacological activation of internal p16 gene that is usually inactive due to hypermethylation in the tumor cells.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.","title":"The interaction and effects of hypoxia, surrounding fibroblasts and p16 expression on breast cancer cell migration and invasion","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4936"}
