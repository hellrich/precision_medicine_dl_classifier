We report a case of FDT in a 48-year-old man with myasthenia gravis, in whom a slow-growing mediastinal mass that had been surgically excised manifested after 3 years with a local recurrence in the same site. The lesion was aspirated and cytology showed a tumor composed of groups of oval or elongated cells intermingled with several mature small lymphocytes. On histology, the tumor was highly cellular with abundant perivascular lymphocytic infiltration; large cells with pale, eosinophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei, arranged in fascicles often showed a storiform pattern. Occasional binucleated cells were also present. A panel of antibodies showed positivity only for CD21 and CD35, and a weak response to S-100. Electron microscopy showed that the layer cells had convoluted nuclei and elongated interdigitating processes with desmosome-like junctions. The definitive diagnosis of FDT can be concluded only with positive immunostaining for CD21 and CD35. However, in the presence of a mixed population of lymphocytes and larger eosinophilic cells the hypothesis of FDT should always be considered.","title":"Follicular dendritic cell tumor of the mediastinum.","pubmedId":"11745075"}
