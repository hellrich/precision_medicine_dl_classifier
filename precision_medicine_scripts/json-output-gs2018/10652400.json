Controversy exists in the literature regarding outcomes for younger patients. The goal of this research project was to compare baseline features and outcomes for young patients (\u003c/\u003d40 years), middle-aged patients (41-64 years), and old patients (\u003e/\u003d65 years). To investigate the relationship between age and important presenting features and outcomes, 1160 recently diagnosed patients first treated at Washington University between 1980 and 1991 were identified from an existing database. Full 5-year survival information was available for 1030 patients (89%). Overall, the 5-year survival rate was 46% (478/1030); young patients (65%, 26/40) had a significantly better survival rate than middle-aged (52%, 292/566) or old patients (38%, 160/424) (chi(2) \u003d 24.5; P \u003d 0. 001). Survival was also related to smoking, comorbidity, primary site, TNM stage, and nodal disease. Age remained a significant factor even after we controlled for these other factors. Young patients developed fewer recurrent and new primary tumors. We conclude that young patients have a much better overall prognosis than older patients. The reasons for this difference are unclear, but it appears that the impact of age goes beyond an actuarial effect.","title":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: better to be young.","pubmedId":"10652400"}
