Of the 21 cases, five were diagnosed as LSIL and 16 as HSIL. Normal cervical mucosas from five patients were studied with c-Met as control cases.\nOverexpression of c-Met was found in all five of LSIL specimens. C-Met overexpression was observed in 11 cases of HSIL. No c-Met overexpression was seen in any of the five control cases.\nThese results revealed that c-Met oncogene overexpression is an important parameter in cervical early oncogenesis and may have a role in malignant transformation of cervical epithelial cells.","title":"Overexpression of c-Met in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.","pubmedId":"23327059"}
