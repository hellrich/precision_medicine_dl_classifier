Diagnosing abdominal pain due to metastatic melanoma is best accomplished by intraluminal studies and computed tomography. Surgical resection of the tumor burden limited to the gastrointestinal tract has been shown to extend periods of palliation in this poor long-term survival group.\nWe will review a case of abdominal pain in a melanoma patient and review the literature.","title":"Abdominal pain in a patient with melanoma.","pubmedId":"9793521"}
