Fifteen years after the first description, anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCL) are now thought to be a heterogeneous group in terms of their clinical, morphologic, phenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular biology features. However, on the basis of a specific genetic anomaly and expression of a chimeric nucleophosmin anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) protein and its variants, a distinct clinicopathologic entity defined as \"ALK-positive lymphoma\" or \"ALKoma\" can be recognized. Based on molecular and clinical criteria, 3 entities of primary ALCL can be identified: primary systemic ALK positive, primary systemic ALK negative, and primary cutaneous ALCL. This review focuses on advances in the knowledge of primary systemic ALCL biology and discusses therapeutic approaches based on ALK expression. The presence of this protein appears to be an important prognostic factor and, combined with an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, could allow researchers to design more specific clinical trials aimed at finding new, more efficacious and less toxic treatments.","title":"Primary systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (CD30+): advances in biology and current therapeutic approaches.","pubmedId":"11707867"}
