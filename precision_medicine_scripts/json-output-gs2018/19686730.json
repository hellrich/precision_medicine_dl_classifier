Therefore, effects of TRK-820 ((E)-N-[17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4,5alpha-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6beta-yl]-3-(furan-3-yl)-N-methylprop-2-enamide monohydrochloride), a selective kappa opioid receptor agonist, were investigated on rotational behavior in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated rats (hemi-parkinsonian rats) and on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia produced by administering L-DOPA to hemi-parkinsonian rats for 3 weeks (dyskinesia rats). A single administration of subcutaneous TRK-820 significantly increased spontaneous ipsilateral rotational behavior of hemi-parkinsonian rats at 30 microg/kg though the efficacy was moderate and also significantly inhibited L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia at 10 and 30 microg/kg; this inhibition was reversed in the presence of nor-binaltorphimine, a kappa opioid receptor antagonist. In vivo microdialysis study, TRK-820 (30 microg/kg, s.c.) significantly inhibited L-DOPA-derived extracellular dopamine content in the 6-OHDA-treated striatum in dyskinesia rats, but not in hemi-parkinsonian rats. Moreover, the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia was suppressed by the 3-week co-administration of TRK-820 (3 and 10 microg/kg, s.c.) with L-DOPA. These results have suggested that TRK-820 ameliorates L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia with a moderate anti-parkinsonian effect by inhibiting L-DOPA-induced excessive dopamine release through kappa opioid receptors only in dyskinesia rats; therefore, TRK-820 is expected to become a useful agent for the treatment of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.","title":"TRK-820, a selective kappa opioid receptor agonist, could effectively ameliorate L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia symptoms in a rat model of Parkinson\u0027s disease.","pubmedId":"19686730"}
