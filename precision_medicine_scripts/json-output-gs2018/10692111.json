The main obstacle in treatment of metastatic melanoma is the resistance to chemotherapy. Recent studies indicated that apoptosis is a common mechanism of action for various cytotoxic agents. As p53 plays an important part in apoptosis, we investigated the role of p53 in chemosensitivity of melanoma cells. Previously, we found that melanoma cell lines containing wild-type p53 have significantly higher response rates to chemotherapy than cell lines with a mutant p53 gene. To confirm the role of p53 in melanoma chemosensitivity further, we transfected an expression vector, pED1, which carries a mutant p53 gene, into a wild-type p53 melanoma cell line, MMAN. We examined the effect of mutant p53 on camptothecin-induced apoptosis and the expression of genes which are known to be involved in apoptosis or drug resistance, such as bcl-2, bax, bak, p21waf1, and P-glycoprotein. Our results indicate that overexpression of the mutant p53 increased the growth rate of MMAN cells, reduced the sensitivity to camptothecin, and lowered drug-induced apoptosis by 2-3-fold. Flow cytometry indicated that the camptothecin-induced apoptosis is not associated with G1 arrest. Furthermore, camptothecin treatment reduced bcl-2 and P-glycoprotein expression in wild-type p53 MMAN cells, but not cells overexpressing mutant p53. These results demonstrate that p53 mutational status is a determinant of melanoma chemosensitivity. p53 may downregulate bcl-2 and P-glycoprotein to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells after chemotherapy.","title":"p53-dependent apoptosis in melanoma cells after treatment with camptothecin.","pubmedId":"10692111"}
