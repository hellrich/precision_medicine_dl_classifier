However, there was no statistically significant correlation between LOH at these three loci with such clinical parameters as pathological types, tumor size, invasiveness, and lymph-node metastasis.\nThese data suggest that LOH at APC, MCC and DCC loci in esophageal carcinoma is, to certain extent, a common genetic alteration which might play a role in esophageal carcinogenesis.","title":"[The possible role of loss of heterozygosity at APC, MCC and DCC genetic loci in esophageal carcinoma].","pubmedId":"11776787"}
