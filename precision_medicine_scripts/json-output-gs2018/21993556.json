Although much effort has been launched to pharmacologically disable activated oncogenes, one sidelined approach is the restoration of tumor suppressive signals. As TP53 is often structurally preserved, but functionally crippled, by CDKN2A/ARF loss in melanoma, rescue of p53 function represents an attractive point of vulnerability in melanoma. In this study, we showed that both p53 protein and activity levels in melanoma cells were strongly induced by nutlin-3, a canonical HDM2 antagonist. Among a test panel of 51 cell lines, there was a marked reduction in melanoma viability that was directly linked to TP53 status. Moreover, we also found that the melanoma growth suppression mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition was potentiated by HDM2 antagonism. These results provide fundamental insights into the intact p53 circuitry, which can be restored through small molecule inhibitors and potentially deployed for therapeutic gain.","title":"p53 rescue through HDM2 antagonism suppresses melanoma growth and potentiates MEK inhibition.","pubmedId":"21993556"}
