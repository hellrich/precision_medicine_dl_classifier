Incidence and risk factors for second squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas were studied in a cohort of 1380 psoralen + ultraviolet A-treated psoriasis patients prospectively followed for over 20 y; 264 had a squamous cell carcinoma and 258 a basal cell carcinoma after beginning psoralen + ultraviolet A therapy. After a first squamous cell carcinoma, the risk of a second squamous cell carcinoma was 26% at 1 y, 62% at 5 y, and 75% at 10 y. Risk increased with high psoralen + ultraviolet A exposure prior to the first squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio 3.32, 95% confidence interval 1.53, 7.18). Higher rates of post-first squamous cell carcinoma psoralen + ultraviolet A treatment also were associated with greater risk (hazard ratio 1.56 for every additional 10 treatments per year for patients with low pre-first squamous cell carcinoma psoralen + ultraviolet A exposure, 95% confidence interval 1.35, 1.81). Patients exposed to high levels of tar and/or ultraviolet B before a first squamous cell carcinoma were also at higher risk (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.14-2.60). Risk of a second basal cell carcinoma was 21% at 1 y, 49% at 5 y, and 61% at 10 y. There was some evidence that high exposure to psoralen + ultraviolet A before a first basal cell carcinoma was associated with increased risk of second basal cell carcinoma (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.97-2.17). Higher post-first tumor psoralen + ultraviolet A treatment rates also increased risk (hazard ratio 1.24 for every additional 10 treatments per year, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.47). Psoralen + ultraviolet A-treated psoriasis patients appear to have a greatly increased incidence of second squamous cell carcinoma compared with the general population. Patients who develop a squamous cell carcinoma after starting psoralen + ultraviolet A therapy should be closely monitored for a subsequent squamous cell carcinoma.","title":"Incidence and risk factors associated with a second squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma in psoralen + ultraviolet a light-treated psoriasis patients.","pubmedId":"12060400"}
