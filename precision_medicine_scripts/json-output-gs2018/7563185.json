RET mutations are associated with the dominantly inherited cancer syndromes multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). In MEN 2A, MEN 2B, and FMTC, direct detection of RET mutations can be used to identify disease allele carriers prior to the development of clinically evident neoplasms. RET mutations are also associated with sporadic thyroid carcinomas. The effects of RET mutation on protein function have been investigated both in vivo and in vitro, and the study of RET has served to provide insights into the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in general.","title":"RET gene and its implications for cancer.","pubmedId":"7563185"}
