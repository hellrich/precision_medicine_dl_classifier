Despite advances in understanding the molecular biology of AML, its treatment remains challenging. Standard regimens using cytarabine and anthracyclines for induction followed by some form of postremission therapy produce response rates of 60% to 70%, with less than 20% of all patients achieving long-term disease-free survival. New therapies are emerging based on the definition of specific cytogenetic-molecular abnormalities. Such targeted therapies offer the promise of better antileukemic activity in adult AML.","title":"Adult acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"16471082"}
