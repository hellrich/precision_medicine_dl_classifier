Cytotoxic agents fundamentally lack the ability to achieve disease control and cytokine therapy with interleukin-2 has an unacceptably high - for the use across all patient cohorts - rate of toxicities. The validation of braf as an oncogene driving melanoma tumorigenesis, as well as the discovery of the role of CTLA-4 receptor in the evasion of anticancer immune response by melanoma, has revolutionised our treatment options against a disease with dismal prognosis. Quick implementation of translational discoveries brought about BRAF/MEK inhibition in clinic, while at the same time, wider experience with CTLA-4 blockade enabled clinicians to manage previously fatal immune-related toxicities with greater confidence. The suitability for clinical use of other oncogenic drivers such as NRAS and c-kit is currently being tested whilst the PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 axis has emerged as a new immunotherapy target with exciting early phase results. The recent exponential progress in treatment of melanoma has set an example of translational medicine and the current review aims to explain why, as well as suggesting new goals for the future.
