The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical performances of a novel assay for the quantification of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts (e13a2 and e14a2) and ABL1 in a single reaction. This assay is based on the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in multiplex format. In a retrospective comparative clinical study performed in a reference laboratory, RNA was extracted from 48 CML patient blood samples with various BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratios and RT-qPCR was performed using either MAScIR assay or the RT-qPCR simplex reference assay used in routine clinical testing. The comparative clinical results showed high qualitative and quantitative concordance (correlation coefficient \u003e0.95) between MAScIR and the reference assays. The present study illustrates the utility of MAScIR assay as a sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective quantitative device to monitor the BCR-ABL1 ratios by RT-qPCR on whole blood of diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia patients. This test could be used as an aid in the assessment of molecular response to available treatments.","title":"Evaluation of a novel multiplex RT-qPCR assay for the quantification of leukemia-associated BCR-ABL1 translocation.","pubmedId":"26243622"}
