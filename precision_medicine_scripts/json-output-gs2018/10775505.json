FGFs mediate their biological responses by activating high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptors. Currently, there are four human fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes. To investigate the mechanisms by which alpha FGF and beta FGF may mediate mitogenic signal transduction in human skin-derived fibroblasts, we analyzed these cells for the presence of high-affinity FGFRs. We show that normal human dermal fibroblasts express a single high-affinity FGFR gene, FGFR-1. Cloning and sequencing of two distinct FGFR-1 cDNAs suggested that normal human dermal fibroblasts express a membrane-bound and a putatively secreted form of FGFR-1. We show that normal human dermal fibroblasts produce two FGFR-1 proteins, one of which exists in conditioned media. The mRNA for the putatively secreted form of FGFR-1 appears to be down-regulated by serum treatment of the cells.","title":"Normal human fibroblasts produce membrane-bound and soluble isoforms of FGFR-1.","pubmedId":"10775505"}
