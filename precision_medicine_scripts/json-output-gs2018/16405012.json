ALK expression was variable: 93% at the age up to 20, 60% at the age from 20 to 40 years, none at the age 40 years and older. Morphological similarities between ALCL, classic variants of Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma, variants of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may require immunohistochemical investigation the criteria of which are suggested.","title":"[Diagnosis of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma].","pubmedId":"16405012"}
