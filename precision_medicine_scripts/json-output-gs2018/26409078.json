Entities commonly found are toxoplasmosis, lymphomas, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. In some patients, diagnosis is not feasible with imaging alone, requiring biopsy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of stereotactic biopsy in HIV patients on adjustment of therapy.\nBetween January 2004 and May 2015 at our clinic, 26 HIV-infected patients underwent stereotactic biopsy. Thin-layer magnetic resonance images were obtained and fused with computed tomography scans, taken with the stereotactic frame (Leksell) mounted. Biopsy material was evaluated pathologically and microbiologically.\nHistologic analysis revealed B-cell lymphoma in 6 patients (23.1%) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in 2 patients (7.7%). Abscess and toxoplasmosis were found in 3 patients each (11.5% and 11.5%), and encephalitis occurred in 4 patients (15.4%). In 2 patients each (7.7%), vasculitis, metastasis, and glioblastoma were diagnosed. Further findings comprised non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma in 1 patient each. After biopsy, treatment was significantly changed in 18 (69.2%) patients (P \u003c 0.01). Antibiotic therapy was adjusted in 6 patients (23.1%), and chemotherapy in 3 patients (16.7%). Other changes included antibiotic/antiviral therapy to chemotherapy in 3 patients (16.7%), chemotherapy to radiation, cortisone to chemotherapy, and aciclovir to cortisone in 1 patient each. One patient with glioblastoma underwent resection, and another patient received radiation. One patient underwent palliative care.\nStereotactic biopsy in HIV-infected patients results in significant changes of therapy in more than two thirds of the patients.","title":"Impact of Stereotactic Biopsy in HIV Patients.","pubmedId":"26409078"}
