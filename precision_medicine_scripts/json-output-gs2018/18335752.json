In 3 cases, both RET/PTC and H4-PTEN were identified simultaneously. However, repeated experiments did not give the same results of H4-PTEN rearrangement. The overall frequency of rearrangement was 21.4% (27/126). The patients with gene rearrangement were younger (P \u003d 0.02) and had a higher frequency of lymph node involvement (P \u003d 0.02). High frequency of lateral neck lymph node involvement was detected in RET/PTC positive PTC (P \u003c 0.01). PTEN/H4 rearrangement could also be detected in medullary thyroid carcinoma (2/5).\nH4-PTEN rearrangement can occur simultaneously with RET/PTC rearrangement in PTC. High predisposition to gene rearrangement is a characteristic of PTC. The patients of PTC with gene rearrangement are younger and have a higher frequency of lymph node involvement.","title":"[Gene rearrangement analysis of papillary thyroid carcinoma].","pubmedId":"18335752"}
