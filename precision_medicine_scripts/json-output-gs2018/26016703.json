In the 59 MMM patients, the nasal cavity was the most common anatomic site (n \u003d 31, 43.7% of all non-CMM), followed by the oral cavity (n \u003d 9, 12.7%), the genitourinary tract (n \u003d 9, 12.7%), the anorectum (n \u003d 8, 11.3%), and the gastrointestinal tract (n \u003d 2, 2.8%). In the 12 patients with OMM, anatomic sites included the choroid (n \u003d 8, 11.3% of all non-CMM) and the conjunctiva (n \u003d 4, 5.6%). The survival outcome of patients with OMM was much better than that of patients with MMM (P \u003c 0.001). In MMM patients, anorectal melanoma was associated with a worse survival outcome. Age of â‰¥ 70 years (P \u003c 0.001) and tumor size of \u003e 2 cm (P \u003d 0.02) were significantly poor prognostic factors in MMM. Age (relative risk [RR] 1.068, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.006-1.133; P \u003d 0.03) and tumor size (RR 1.410, 95% CI 1.038-1.915; P \u003d 0.028) were independent predictors for the postoperative survival of MMM patients. Patients with these two risk factors had a higher risk for recurrence or death (RR 3.107, 95% CI 1.627-5.595).\nOur findings demonstrate that prognoses differ in patients with different anatomic sites of primary non-CMM. Advanced age and larger tumor size are the main factors affecting prognosis. Patients with poor risk factors should be treated differently to improve their survival outcome.","title":"Clinicopathologic features and prognostic factors in patients with non-cutaneous malignant melanoma: a single-center retrospective study of 71 cases.","pubmedId":"26016703"}
