The rapid progress and high fatality make it difficult to cure the patients suffering from AML. Choice of treatment is limited, consisting primarily of chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Pharmaceutical companies are focused on designing new drugs that may be efficacious in treating the disease and prolong the survival of the patients. However, the lack of AML model and specific biomarkers hinder the progress of research on this cancer type. Here we successfully validated subcutaneous and systemic models derived from a number of AML cell lines, such as MV4-11, HL-60, Molm-16, and ML-2, in NOD/SCID mice to evaluate the antitumor activities of new compounds. Biomarkers, such as CD45, CD38 and CD15 in PBMC, spleen and bone marrow from the systemic models, are used in detecting and monitoring the disease progress. These biomarkers correlated with tumor take rate, disease progression and response to standard of care treatments. In conclusion, AML xenograft models with biomarker strategies provide valuable platforms for the development of new compounds targeting this deadly disease.","title":"Xenograft models of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with biomarker strategies are valuable in development of new drugs targeting AML","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1349"}
