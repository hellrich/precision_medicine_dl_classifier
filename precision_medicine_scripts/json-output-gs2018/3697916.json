All 25 MPN cases had squamous carcinoma of the head and neck; however, only 40% (N \u003d 10) had squamous carcinoma of the lung. The histologic types of non-squamous lung carcinoma were: adenocarcinoma 36% (N \u003d 9), small cell carcinoma 20% (N \u003d 5), and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma 4% (N \u003d 1). Of 927 cases of MPN of the head and neck and lung reported in the English language literature, only 100 cases (10.78%) demonstrated a histologic discrepancy between the primary tumors. Recent reports demonstrate a histologic shift toward non-squamous lung carcinoma in MPN that is similar to our data, and that corresponds to the increase in non-squamous carcinomas recently seen in lung cancer in general. Possible implications of these findings are discussed.","title":"Multiple primary neoplasia of the head and neck and lung. The changing histopathology.","pubmedId":"3697916"}
