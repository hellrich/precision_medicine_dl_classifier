However, the role of p53 in human malignant melanoma is still unclear. Therefore, we investigated melanoma metastases from 11 patients cytogenetically and with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) after short-term culture, employing a p53 region-specific probe for 17p13.1 and a probe detecting the centromere of chromosome 17. Furthermore, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from nine of these patients were investigated immunohistochemically for expression of the p53 protein. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 were seen in six melanomas in cytogenetic analysis. With FISH, three malignant melanomas had clones with only one p53-allele and an additional four malignant melanomas showed a reduced number of signals at the p53 tumour-suppressor gene locus compared with signals for the centromeric region of chromosome 17. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Our results suggest that the 17p11-13 region is frequently deleted in malignant melanomas and that p53 or other genes located on this band might contribute to the malignant potential of advanced melanoma.","title":"Deletions of the region 17p11-13 in advanced melanoma revealed by cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization.","pubmedId":"10408704"}
