Vaccinating patients with autologous antigen presenting cells (APC) expressing tumor-associated antigens (TAA) represents a promising approach for activating tumor-reactive T cells in vivo. In addition, APC expressing TAA provide a means of generating tumor-specific T cells in vitro, for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Lentiviral vectors are attractive vehicles for introducing TAA-encoding genes into APC. In this study, lentiviral vectors expressing the reporter gene GFP or the melanoma-associated antigen tyrosinase were used to transduce three different kinds of human APC: monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC), CD40L-activated B lymphocytes, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B lymphocytes. Using optimized transduction conditions for each cell type, tyrosinase was expressed at levels sufficient to stimulate antigen-specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted T cells from melanoma patients. While transduced EBV-B cells demonstrated the highest level of transgene expression, optimal T-cell recognition was achieved with transduced DC. Substituting the CAG promoter for PGK in lentiviral constructs enhanced transgene expression in DC and EBV-B cells, amplifying T cell recognition. Lentiviruses inducing sustained transgene expression with relatively low cellular toxicity and background viral gene expression may be ideal vectors for immunotherapeutic applications.","title":"Lentivirus vector-mediated expression of tumor-associated epitopes by human antigen presenting cells.","pubmedId":"15053864"}
