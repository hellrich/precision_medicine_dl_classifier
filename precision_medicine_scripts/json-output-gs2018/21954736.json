We collected prospective data of melanoma patients in tumour stage III before radical lymph node dissection.\nBetween 2003 until 2007 we collected 231 tumour stage III patients and analysed the preoperative serum tumour markers S100 (S100 calcium binding protein), NSE (Neuron specific enolase, Enolase 2), Albumin, LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) and CRP (C-reactive protein) and evaluated the correlation to clinical and pathological data. We divided patients into a group with only a positive sentinel lymph node (group 1; n \u003d 109) and a second with further lymph node metastases (group 2; n \u003d 122).\nPatients of group 2 had a significant higher T level (p \u003c 0.0001) and Breslow index (p \u003c 0.0001). Patients with a higher Breslow index had a higher S100 serum level (p \u003d 0.021). Patients of group 2 displayed a significant higher level of serum S100. The serum level of CRP correlated with increasing number of lymph node metastases.\nA higher Breslow index in tumour stage III patients seems to have an influence on lymph node metastases and on S100 serum level. Patients with more than a positive sentinel lymph node do have a higher S100 level.","title":"Analysing the serum levels of tumour markers and primary tumour data in stage III melanoma patients in correlation to the extent of lymph node metastases--a prospective study in 231 patients.","pubmedId":"21954736"}
