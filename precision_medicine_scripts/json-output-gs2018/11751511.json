BM aspirates from 920 patients with primary breast cancer were analyzed for tumor cells by standardized direct immunocytochemical analysis (ICC) of 2 x 10(6) mononuclear cells (MNCs) using anticytokeratin monoclonal antibody (AE1/AE3). Samples (637) were analyzed by negative immunomagnetic enrichment (IMS) followed by ICC (10 x 10(6) MNCs). Analyses of the primary tumor specimens have been performed, including histomorphology, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging, grading, and immunohistochemical analyses.\nOf the patients with infiltrating carcinoma, 63% were node negative (N0) and 33%, node positive (N+). The results show the presence of tumor cells in 13.4% of the evaluable patients after direct ICC analysis. The presence of tumor cells correlated to the nodal- and tumor stage, showing BM positivity in 9.9% of the N0 cases and 20.6% in the N+ group (P \u003c 0.0005), 11.2% of the stage T(1) were positive, and 15.0% and 22.6% were positive in the T(2) and T(3/4) groups, respectively (P \u003d 0.013). No correlation between detection of ITC and detection of p53 and cathepsin D expression was found. Vascular invasion and c-erbB2 expression were associated with ITCs in BM (P \u003d 0.045 and P \u003d 0.024, respectively). Node-negative patients with estrogen receptor (ER)+ and/or progesterone receptor (PgR)+ tumors had lower frequency of ITCs than ER-/PgR- (P \u003d 0.004). The use of negative IMS increased the frequency of positive BM by 63% (P \u003c 0.0005).\nThe direct ICC detection of ITCs in BM correlated with primary tumor stage, nodal stage, vascular invasion, c-erbB2 expression, and ER/PgR status. Analysis of larger BM samples by negative IMS resulted in increased number of ITC-positive patients.","title":"Detection of isolated tumor cells in bone marrow in early-stage breast carcinoma patients: comparison with preoperative clinical parameters and primary tumor characteristics.","pubmedId":"11751511"}
