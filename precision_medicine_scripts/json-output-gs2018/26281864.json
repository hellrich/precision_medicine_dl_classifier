DPYD gene variations can potentially predict toxicity to 5-fluorouracil (FU)-based therapy and KRAS-, NRAS-, BRAF-, PIK3CA-wild type status is a known prerequisite for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor therapy. This study was performed to search for a possible link between these therapeutic markers.\nThe DPYD gene variations c.496A\u003eG, c.1679T\u003eG, c.2846A\u003eT and KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA mutational status were determined in non-neoplastic, primary CRC and metastatic CRC tissue from 115 patients.\nThe polymorphism c.496A\u003eG was the DPYD gene variant with the highest detection rate (12.9%), occurred predominantly in females (86.7%, p\u003d0.0044) and was exclusively seen in KRAS wild type primary CRC (15/65 (23.1%) vs 0/51 (0%) in KRAS-mutated primary CRC, respectively, p\u003d0.0001).\nThis genetic profile could define a patient group requiring alternative combined therapeutic approaches. Global testing of large patient cohorts is necessary to prove this concept.","title":"Correlation between DPYD gene variation and KRAS wild type status in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"26281864"}
