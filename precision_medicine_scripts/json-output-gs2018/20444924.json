The heat shock protein (HSP) 90 chaperone is required for folding and stability of several kinases. HSP90 is specifically inhibited by 17-allyl-amino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG).\nOur aim was to investigate whether RET protein half-life depends on HSP90 and to dissect the molecular pathway responsible for the degradation of RET upon HSP90 inhibition by 17-AAG.\n17-AAG effects were studied in RAT1 fibroblasts exogenously expressing MEN2-associated RET mutants and human MTC-derived cell lines.\n17-AAG induced a 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of wild-type RET and MEN2-associated RET mutants. The compound hampered HSP90/RET interaction and stabilized RET binding to HSP70, leading to the recruitment of the HSP70-associated E3 ligase C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein. In turn, C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein polyubiquitinated RET, promoting its proteasomal degradation. 17-AAG blocked RET downstream effectors and RET-dependent transcriptional activation of gene promoters. In human MTC cells carrying oncogenic RET mutants, HSP90 inhibition induced receptor degradation and signaling hindrance leading to cell cycle arrest.\nRET and MEN2-associated RET mutants rely on HSP90 for protein stability, and HSP90 blockade by 17-AAG promotes RET degradation.","title":"RET is a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) client protein and is knocked down upon HSP90 pharmacological block.","pubmedId":"20444924"}
