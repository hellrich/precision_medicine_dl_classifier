To inhibit the pathways selectively, 3 specific kinase inhibitors, AG1478 (an inhibitor of EGFR), PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK) and LY294002 (an inhibitor of PI3K), were combined with radiation.\nRadiation in combination with these kinase inhibitors potentiated radiation-induced cell killing synergistically. Enhancement ratios were greater in TE-2 than those in TE-1. Radiation in combination with kinase inhibitors increased the expression of the active form of caspase-3 and the PARP cleavage only in TE-2 that has wild-type p53.\nTargeting the key molecules of the survival signal transduction pathway resulted in potentiation of radiation-induced cell killing. The results of this study suggest that the survival signal transduction pathways would be a molecular target in enhancing radiosensitivity.","title":"Selective inhibition of survival signal transduction pathways enhanced radiosensitivity in human esophageal cancer cell lines in vitro.","pubmedId":"15161032"}
