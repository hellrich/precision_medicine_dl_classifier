Here, we report that programmed death-1high (PD-1high) tumor antigen (TA)-specific CD8+ T cells present at periphery and at tumor sites in patients with advanced melanoma upregulate IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) expression. IL-10 is produced by multiple PBMC subsets in melanoma patients and acts directly on IL-10R+ TA-specific CD8+ T cells to impede proliferation and increase apoptosis. PD-1 blockade augments IL-10R expression by TA-specific CD8+ T cells, suggesting that PD-1 blockade renders PD-1+ TA-specific CD8+ T cells more sensitive to the immunosuppressive effects of endogenous IL-10. As a result, we show that IL-10 blockade adds to PD-1 blockade to increase the expansion and functions of TA-specific CD8+ T cells. Collectively, our findings support dual IL-10 and PD-1 blockade to counteract melanoma-induced T cell dysfunction and enhance TA-specific CD8+ T cell responses in patients with advanced melanoma.","title":"Interleukin-10 and programmed death-1 cooperate to regulate tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in melanoma patients","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4046"}
