Highly restricted expression patterns in melanocytic tumors were identified in vivo. We therefore quantitated serum levels of MIA protein by means of a non-radioactive ELISA and investigated whether MIA provides clinically relevant parameters in patients with malignant melanomas. Here we report enhanced MIA serum levels in 13% and 23% of patients with stage I and II disease, respectively, and in 100% with stage III or IV disease. Response to therapy in stage IV disease correlated with changes in MIA serum levels and surgical removal of metastases led to normalization of serum values. Repeated measuring of sera from 350 patients with a history of stage I or II melanoma during follow-up, we detected 32 patients developing positive MIA values. At the time of serum analysis 15 of them had developed metastases and one presented with metastatic disease 6 months later. In conclusion, MIA represents a novel serum marker for systemic malignant melanoma revealing the highest sensitivity and specificity among currently available markers.","title":"MIA, a novel serum marker for progression of malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"10470221"}
