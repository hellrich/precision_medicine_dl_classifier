Our studies in melanoma suggest a different mechanism-one of \"adaptive immune resistance\" in which PD-L1 expression is primarily driven by cytokine induction and is independent of BRAF mutational status.","title":"Innate vs. Adaptive: PD-L1-mediated immune resistance by melanoma.","pubmedId":"26451298"}
