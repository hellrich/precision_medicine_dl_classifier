The mean age at diagnosis was 38.2 years. The mean interval between the first and second melanoma was 34.3 months. Of the second melanomas, 76.8% developed in a different anatomic region from the first melanomas. The mean tumor thickness (Breslow) decreased from 1.11 mm for the first melanomas to 0.90 mm for the second melanomas.\nThe results suggest that genetic factors might be involved in a certain subset of patients in whom melanomas develop early and successively.","title":"Multiple primary melanomas.","pubmedId":"11148472"}
