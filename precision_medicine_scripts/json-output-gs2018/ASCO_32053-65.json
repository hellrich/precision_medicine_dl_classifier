Previous studies indicate that the incidence of esophageal cancer is more in males than females; however the influence of sex in the progression of esophageal cancer is not clearly understood. In vitro and in vivo models showed that administration of estradiol significantly inhibited the growth of ER-positive and AR-positive KSE-1 tumors in both males and females in conjunction with an increase in the estradiol levels and a decrease in the DHT levels in the serum. Thus we tested the clinical significance of sex in the overall survival of esophageal cancer using SEER data. Methods: A total of 21,584 patients with localized and metastatic esophageal cancer from 1988-2004 were screened using the SEER registry. The patients were divided into age at diagnosis, sex and ethnicity. The analysis for overall survival was based on the Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for marital status, site of primary tumor, treatment, histology and tumor grade and stratified by year of diagnosis and SEER registry site. Pairwise interactions (age and sex, age and race, and sex and race) were also examined. Results: Females with localized esophageal cancer had significantly longer overall survival compared to males (p\u003c0.001). In metastatic esophageal cancer, females seemed to have longer overall survival than males (p\u003d0.054). Overall survival decreased with increasing age (p\u003c0.001). African Americans with localized esophageal cancer have worse median overall survival compared to Caucasians (p\u003c0.001). No significant difference was noted with respect to ethnicity in metastatic esophageal cancer (p\u003d0.22). Also pairwise interactions did not have significant difference. Conclusions: This is the first and largest study showing gender as an independent prognostic factor in patients with localized and metastatic esophageal cancer. Females had a significant better overall survival than males in esophageal cancer suggesting that sex hormone pathways may have a potential impact on tumor progression. These data warrant further studies to explore the role of these pathways in the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal cancer.","title":"Effect of gender and age on overall survival in patients with esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32053-65"}
