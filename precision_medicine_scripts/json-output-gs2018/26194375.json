Their medical records and pathologic slides were reviewed and immunohistochemistry for basic fibroblast growth factor, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2, FGFR3, c-kit, Myb proto-oncogene protein, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Ki-67 was performed. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed for determination of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).\nIn univariate analyses, primary site of nasal cavity and paranasal sinus (p\u003d0.022) and Ki-67 expression of more than 7% (p\u003d0.001) were statistically significant factors for poor DFS. Regarding OS, perineural invasion (p\u003d0.032), high expression of VEGF (p\u003d0.033), and high expression of Ki-67 (p\u003d0.007) were poor prognostic factors. In multivariate analyses, primary site of nasal cavity and paranasal sinus (p\u003d0.028) and high expression of Ki-67 (p\u003d0.004) were independent risk factors for poor DFS, and high expression of VEGF (p\u003d0.011) and Ki-67 (p\u003d0.011) showed independent association with poor OS.\nHigh expression of VEGF and Ki-67 were independent poor prognostic factors for OS in ACC.","title":"VEGF and Ki-67 Overexpression in Predicting Poor Overall Survival in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26194375"}
