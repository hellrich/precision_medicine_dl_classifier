In the current study, we evaluated whether SEMA4B may also affect the growth of NSCLC. We thus used two human NSCLC lines, A549 and Calu-3, to examine our hypothesis. We found that overexpression of SEMA4B significantly decreased NSCLC cell growth, while SEMA4B inhibition significantly increased NSCLC cell growth, both in vitro and in vivo in an implanted NSCLC model. Adaptation of SEMA4B in NSCLC cells did not alter cell apoptosis, but changed the cell proliferation. Further analyses show that SEMA4B may induce FoxO1 nuclear retention through suppressing PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which subsequently inhibited cell growth through the direct nuclear target of FoxO1, p21. Our study thus demonstrate a role of SEMA4B in suppressing NSCLC growth, besides its role in inhibiting cell metastasis, and highlights SEMA4B as a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC.
