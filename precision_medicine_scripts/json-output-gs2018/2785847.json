This tumor is a teratoma originating in the ovary with pathogenesis and metastatic properties similar to those of human ovarian cancer. Drug was given on a schedule of once every 3 days for 3 doses 1 or 2 days after i.p. implant of 10(7) tumor cells. Despite the 2-fold attenuation of dosage required, antitumor activity of the combination (increased life span, 161%) was approximately twice that obtained with maximum tolerated doses of either agent alone and tumor-free, long-term survivors were obtained. Incorporation of s.c. calcium leucovorin administration 16 h after each dose of 10EDAM and cis-Pt allowed a 4-fold increase in dosage of 10-EDAM without an increase in toxicity, increased median survival by an additional 120%, and quadrupled the number of tumor-free, long-term survivors to 40% of treated animals. By comparison, methotrexate was only modestly active against this tumor model either as a single agent, with cis-Pt, or with delayed s.c. calcium leucovorin administration. These results appear to suggest that 10EDAM with cis-Pt may have considerable potential for intracavitary therapy of human cancer, including ovarian carcinoma, particularly when incorporating delayed systemic calcium leucovorin administration.","title":"Intracavitary therapy of murine ovarian cancer with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin incorporating systemic leucovorin protection.","pubmedId":"2785847"}
