Preterm-born 4-year-olds with height \u003c-1 SD had lower systolic and diastolic BP, and 14.4% of the 4-year-olds had albuminuria. Albuminuria was less prevalent in the 4-year-olds with height \u003c-1 SD than in those with height ≥-1 SD (6.8% vs 19.3%; P\u003d.04). Mean albuminuria level was 1.0±0.7 mg/mmol in 4-year-olds with height \u003c-1 SD and 1.4±1.3 mg/mmol in those with height ≥-1 SD. In multivariate analysis, albuminuria level was increased by 0.4±0.2 mg/mmol in preterm-born children with normal height at age 4, and by 0.5±0.2 mg/mmol in females, after adjustment for gestational age, sex, neonatal morbidity, and intrauterine growth restriction. These results were unchanged after adjustment for body mass index.\nNormal height at age 4 years may be associated with an increased risk for glomerulosclerosis in preterm-born children.","title":"Increased albuminuria in 4-year-old preterm-born children with normal height.","pubmedId":"22261507"}
