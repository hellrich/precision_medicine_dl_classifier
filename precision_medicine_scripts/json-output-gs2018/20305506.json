Five patients had their metastatic lesion in the upper eyelid and 1 in the lower eyelid. The mean survival after the diagnosis of melanoma metastatic to the eyelid was 5.3 months. All patients had metastases at other sites detected prior to the diagnosis of the eyelid metastasis. The mean interval from initial primary tumor diagnosis to metastasis to the eyelid was 121 months. In all 6 patients, palliative surgical resection of the metastatic eyelid lesions was carried out.\nMelanoma metastatic to the eyelid is not uncommon in advanced stage cutaneous melanoma. Palliative surgical management of these metastatic lesions should be considered to improve the patient\u0027s quality of life.","title":"Cutaneous melanoma metastatic to the eyelid and periocular skin.","pubmedId":"20305506"}
