All tumors underwent MAPKi resistance screening including RNA expression profiling. Morphological features, PD-L1 immunohistochemical immunoreactivity, and RNA expression profile were correlated with mechanisms of resistance (including mutations in NRAS and MEK, and amplification and aberrant splicing of BRAF).Results: PD-L1 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in tumors that harbored an aberrant BRAF splicing variant (n \u003d 8) or MEK mutations (n \u003d 5) than those with BRAF amplification (n \u003d 4), NRAS mutations (n \u003d 2) or those with unknown resistance mechanisms (n \u003d 4) (mean 27% vs 1%, p \u003d 0.049). Additionally, the PD-L1 immunoreactivity in tumors with known MAPK-reactivating mechanisms (n \u003d 19) tended to be higher than those with unknown resistance mechanisms (n \u003d 4) (mean 17% vs 0%, p \u003d 0.283). The immunoreactivity of PDL1 in progressed lesions was independent of BRAFV600 genotype, RECIST response and type of MAPK inhibitor. Correlations with TIL subsets, RNA expression, and response to subsequent anti-PD-1 therapy are underway.Conclusions: The induction of PD-L1 immunoreactivity following MAPKi treatment in human melanoma is variable, however specific mechanisms of MAPKi resistance may confer increased expression of the inhibitory ligand. Further study is underway examining the association of the above with TIL infiltration, the RNA expression profile, and the response to subsequent anti-PD1 therapy.","title":"Immune expression profiling of MAPK inhibitor resistant tumors based upon mechanisms of resistance","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-5025"}
