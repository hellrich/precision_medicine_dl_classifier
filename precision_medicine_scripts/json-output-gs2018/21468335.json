A dilated fundoscopic exam, Humphrey visual field test, transthoracic echocardiogram, abdominal computed tomography (CT), and blood cultures were all performed.\nA dilated fundoscopic exam revealed temporal segmental optic disc pallor on the left, and Humphrey visual field testing demonstrated a dense left cecocentral scotoma. When the patient developed fever (103. 9Â°F) and palpitations, transthoracic echocardiogram revealed valvular vegetations, and contrast CT of the abdomen revealed an abscess in the dome of the liver likely due to an infectious thrombus. Blood cultures grew viridians group streptococci in three separate peripheral collections.\nThis case illustrates that a sudden cecocentral scotoma may be the initial manifestation of SBE.","title":"Cecocentral scotoma as the initial manifestation of subacute bacterial endocarditis.","pubmedId":"21468335"}
