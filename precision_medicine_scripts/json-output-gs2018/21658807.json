However, there is a small subset of patients with poorer outcome.\nTwenty patients who died of PTC within 10 years of diagnosis were studied to identify prognostic indicators and biological markers of early death. Findings were statistically compared with a previous review of all patients with PTC treated in the same institute and studies in the literature.\nThe study group included 6 men and 14 women with a mean age of 65 years at diagnosis. Average tumor size was 3.6 cm; 16 patients had extracapsular extension. All tumor samples studied histologically stained poorly for p53, Ki67, and CD34. Regional metastases were present in half the patients, and distal metastases in all. All patients had an advanced disease stage (Tumor, Node, Metastases classification), and only 4 had a low score on the Metastases, Age, Completeness of resection, local Invasion, tumor Size risk stratification. Analysis of the findings against data in the literature for the whole population of patients with PTC, who had a considerably better survival (\u003c8% mortality within 8-15 years vs 100% within 10 years in our sample), yielded significant differences for rates of extrathyroidal extension (P \u003d .0001), regional metastases (P \u003d .016), and distant metastases (P \u003d .0001).\nExtrathyroid extension, late regional metastases, and distant metastases may be risk factors for early death from PTC.","title":"Early death from papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"21658807"}
