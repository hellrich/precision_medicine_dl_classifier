How suppressed GH/IGF-I levels impacted growth of PTEN-/- mouse-derived prostate cells (MPPK) was examined by growth and survival signaling of cells cultured in lit/+ or lit/lit serum.\nBody weight, prostate weight and serum GH and IGF-I levels were reduced in lit/lit relative to lit/+ PTEN-/- littermates. While the anterior lobes of lit/+ PTEN-/- prostates consistently presented swollen, indicative of ductal blockage, the degree of prostatic dysplasia in 15- and 20-week-old lit/lit and lit/+ PTEN-/- mice was indistinguishable as measured by normalized prostatic weight, tissue histology, or probasin, PSP94, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin expression. However, growth and AKT activation of MPPK cells was decreased when cultured in lit/lit serum as compared with lit/+ serum and restored in lit/lit serum supplemented with IGF-I and, to a lesser extent, GH.\nThese results suggest that initiation of prostate carcinogenesis by loss of PTEN is not influenced by germline variation of genes encoding signaling molecules in the GH/IGF-I axis, but suggests that these factors may affect the progression of dysplastic phenotype and supports previous studies, indicating that the GH/IGF milieu does impact the growth of PTEN-deficient dysplastic prostatic cells once transformed.","title":"The influence of growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor deficiency on prostatic dysplasia in pbARR2-Cre, PTEN knockout mice.","pubmedId":"23689346"}
