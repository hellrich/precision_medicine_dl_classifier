To define the role of f-BRAF in gliomagenesis, we demonstrate that f-BRAF regulates neural stem cell (NSC), but not astrocyte, proliferation and is sufficient to induce glioma-like lesions in mice. Moreover, f-BRAF-driven NSC proliferation results from tuberin/Rheb-mediated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) hyperactivation, leading to S6-kinase-dependent degradation of p27. Collectively, these results establish mTOR pathway activation as a key growth regulatory mechanism common to both sporadic and familial low-grade gliomas in children.","title":"Pediatric glioma-associated KIAA1549:BRAF expression regulates neuroglial cell growth in a cell type-specific and mTOR-dependent manner.","pubmedId":"23152448"}
