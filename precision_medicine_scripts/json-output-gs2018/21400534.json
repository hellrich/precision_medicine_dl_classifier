Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens were obtained from tissue bank of Cancer Hospital, Fudan University. The expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), P53, C-myc, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were detected by immunohistochemical method.\nThere were significant differences in tumor size, vessel invasion, EGFR, and P53 expression between FGC and SGC patients. The 5-year survival rates were 48% and 57% in FGC and SGC patients, respectively (P \u003d 0.033). Subgroup analysis showed that the 5-year survival rates were worse in FGC patients with nerve invasion, high PCNA expression, negative expression of EGFR, and positive expression of P53 than those in SGC group. Multivariate analysis showed that AJCC stage, tumor size, and nerve invasion were independent prognostic factors in all patients. Furthermore, AJCC stage and P53 expression dramatically affected the prognosis of FGC patients.\nThe prognosis of FGC patients might be worse than those of SGC patients. AJCC stage and P53 expression are independent prognostic factors in FGC patients.","title":"Prognostic analysis of familial gastric cancer in Chinese population.","pubmedId":"21400534"}
