NAD therapy was administered in two 49-day cycles and included cisplatin, floxuridine, paclitaxel and leucovorin. Esophageal resection was performed followed by AD therapy.\nThirty-three patients initiated NAD therapy; 10 experienced grade 3 and 4 toxicities, which included leucopenia, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea and stomatitis. Additionally, 16 patients experienced grade 1 and 2 hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. Fifteen patients were down-staged, of whom five were T2, seven were T1, and three had nodal disease with no evidence of residual cancer in the esophageal bed. Fifteen patients remained T3, and two showed progressive disease. Thirty-two patients proceeded to surgery and 30 were resected. Although all resected patients were eligible for AD therapy, 15 did not receive it either because of patient refusal or surgeon recommendation. Fifteen patients received AD therapy: nine who had remained T3 and six who had down-staged. Three patients experienced grade 3 and 4 toxicities similar to those in NAD therapy. Six patients had grade 1 and 2 toxicities. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 1, 3 and 5 years were 73% (95% CI: 58-88%), 52% (95% CI: 34-69%) and 29% (95% CI: 13-45%), respectively. Median survival was 42 months.\nDeletion of RT may safely allow for more aggressive chemotherapy and increase chances of survival. The results need to be confirmed in a randomized phase II or larger phase III trial.","title":"Neoadjuvant, surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy without radiation for esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"17704532"}
