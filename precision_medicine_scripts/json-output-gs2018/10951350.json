In 4 of 10 families, mutation in exon 10 was found in codon 611.\nOne hundred fifty persons belonging to 30 families were tested, of which 10 families were carriers of RET mutation in exon 10. In 1 of these families with MTC only, 2 brothers were gene carriers of a RET codon 611 mutation and lived without any sign of MTC. One is aged 79 years, and the other died at the age of 71 of other causes.\nThe results indicate that the gene carrier in families with MTC without other endocrine tumors (FMTC) exhibits a highly variable disease course. A 611 codon mutation is most often a rather mild and slow progression form of MTC. Because 2 gene carriers were still alive at age 70 years without showing any sign of the disease, it is tempting to ask if all gene carriers with a 611 codon mutation without other endocrine tumors should be operated on, and if so, at what age? In the authors\u0027 opinion, more information is needed to be able to answer these questions. The current guidelines for treatment of patients with hereditary MTC are discussed.","title":"Is thyroidectomy necessary in RET mutations carriers of the familial medullary thyroid carcinoma syndrome?","pubmedId":"10951350"}
