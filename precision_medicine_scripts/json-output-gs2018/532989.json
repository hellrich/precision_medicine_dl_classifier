Since sexual function in the male seems to be controlled by both dopaminergic stimulatory and serotoninergic inhibitory mechanisms, the patients were treated with serotonin antagonists. In basal conditions mean serum LH, FSH, PRL and testosterone did not significantly differ from those found in normal subjects; no significant variations, except for PRL reduction, were observed after treatment. Both methysergide, in association with bromocriptine or mesterolone, and metergoline, either alone or in association with mesterolone, were ineffective in significantly improving sexual activity.","title":"Effects of serotonin antagonists in sexually impotent men.","pubmedId":"532989"}
