It is currently unclear whether these patients have unique features and whether their treatment should differ from younger patients with CRC. The aim of this study was to better characterize this patients population. Methods: A single-center, retrospective cohort study which included patients diagnosed with CRC at the age of  80 years between 2008-2013. A control group included consecutive patients younger than 80 years diagnosed with CRC during the same period. Clinicopathological characteristics, treatment and outcome were compared between the groups. Results: The study included 350 patients, followed for a median of 40.2 months (range 1.8-97.5). Several significant differences were noted. Elderly patients had a higher proportion of Ashkenazi ethnicity (p \u003c 0.001), lower rates of family history of any cancer (p \u003c 0.001) and family history of CRC (p \u003d 0.006), and a higher rate of personal history of other malignancies (p \u003d 0.035). CRC diagnosis by screening was less frequent in octogenarians (p \u003c 0.001) and their performance status at presentation was worse. Octogenarians were more likely to have tumors located in the right colon (p \u003d 0.029) and had a lower prevalence of well differentiated histology (p \u003d 0.025). They received less treatment and treatment was less aggressive, both in patients with metastatic and non-metastatic disease, regardless of performance status. Their 5-year cancer specific survival was worse (63.4% vs.77.6%, p \u003d 0.009), both for metastatic (p \u003d 0.03) and for non-metastatic disease (p \u003d 0.028). Conclusions: Elderly patients with CRC presented several differences in clinical and tumor characteristics compared to their younger counterparts. They were less likely to receive treatment and they had worse outcome. Further research is needed to better define this growing patient population and to establish their optimal treatment.","title":"Octogenarian patients with colorectal cancer: Characterizing an emerging clinical entity.","pubmedId":"ASCO_174658-195"}
