There are three major subtypes, namely, well/dedifferentiated, myxoid/round cell and pleomorphic LS. In general, LS is known to be a relatively chemo-resistant sarcoma subtype with the exception of the myxoid variant. Conventional chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide represents the mainstay of systemic treatment in the first line. Other active cytotoxic agents include gemcitabine and docetaxel and the marine-derived compounds trabectedin. Recent progress in molecular diagnostics of each single LS subtype has improved the knowledge of the molecular characteristics and has led to two recent treatment targets: the amplification of mouse double minute 2 homolog and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 in well- and dedifferentiated LS. Thus far, only early-phase trials are reported and no new drugs have been introduced in daily clinical practice. The focus of this review is on current systemic treatment options, including novel strategies.
