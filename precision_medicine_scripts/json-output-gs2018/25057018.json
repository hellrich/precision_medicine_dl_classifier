The best-characterized role for ARF is in stabilizing p53 in response to cellular stress. However, ARF has tumor suppressive functions outside this pathway that have not been fully defined. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the ARF tumor suppressor contain abnormal numbers of chromosomes. However, no role for ARF in cell division has previously been proposed. Here we demonstrate a novel, p53-independent role for ARF in the mitotic checkpoint. Consistent with this, loss of ARF results in aneuploidy in vitro and in vivo. ARF(-/-) MEFs exhibit mitotic defects including misaligned and lagging chromosomes, multipolar spindles, and increased tetraploidy. ARF(-/-) cells exhibit overexpression of Mad2, BubR1, and Aurora B, but only overexpression of Aurora B phenocopies mitotic defects observed in ARF(-/-) MEFs. Restoring Aurora B to near-normal levels rescues mitotic phenotypes in cells lacking ARF. Our results define an unexpected role for ARF in chromosome segregation and mitotic checkpoint function. They further establish maintenance of chromosomal stability as one of the additional tumor-suppressive functions of ARF and offer a molecular explanation for the common up-regulation of Aurora B in human cancers.
