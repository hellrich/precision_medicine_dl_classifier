We assessed if biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) is improved by adding 6 months of androgen suppression (AS)  twice 3-month depot LHRH-agonist to primary irradiation (RT) for intermediate or high risk localized T1b-cT2a N0M0 prostate cancer.  Methods:  819 patients staged cT1b-c with PSA  10 ng/ml or Gleason  7 or cT2a (UICC TNM 1997) N0 M0 with PSA  50 ng/ml were randomized between RT or RT+ADT. Centers elected one dose of prostate irradiation: 70, 74, or 78 Gy. Irradiation of pelvic nodes was left to the discretion of each institution. The trial aimed to show an increase of +7.5% in 5-year BPFS (HR\u003d0.714) with 80% power. This requires 274 events in intent-to-treat analysis. HRQoL was assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30+PR25 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00021450).  Results:  Patients were 70 y old in median, 88% had WHO PS 0, 74.8% were intermediate risk, and 24.8% high risk. In the RT arm, 407/409 received RT, in the RT+ADT, 403/410 received RT+ AS and 3 RT. Six patients refused treatment. After a median follow-up of 7.2 years, 201 and 118 events for BPFS were observed in the RT and RT+ AS arm. RT+ AS improved BPFS compared to RT (HR\u003d0.53, CI: 0.42-0.67, P\u003c0.001) irrespective of the radiation dose (heterogeneity P\u003e0.1). The 5-y BPFS increased from 69.3% to 82.5%. Clinical PFS was also statistically significantly improved (205 events, HR\u003d0.63, CI: 0.48-0.84, P\u003d0.001, +7.9% at 5 years). Late genitourinary toxicity was reported by 5.9% vs. 3.6% of the patients, on RT+ AS and RT, respectively (p\u003d0.14), whereas 27.0% vs 19.4% reported severe impairment of sexual function (p\u003d0.010). Overall HRQoL did not differ between the groups. Hormonal treatment symptoms, sexual activity and functioning scales are clinically significantly impaired by AS at month 6 and year 1; from year 2 no marked difference is seen.  Conclusions:  The addition of 6 months of medical castration to primary irradiation improves BPFS and PFS in intermediate- and high-risk localized T1b-cT2a N0M0 prostatic carcinoma with no persistent detriment on HRQoL or sexual function.
