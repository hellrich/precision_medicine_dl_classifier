Here we investigated tumor suppressor genes in mesothelioma cells from tumoral ascites developed in mice exposed to asbestos (asb) fibers and in 12 HMM cell cultures. Mutations in Nf2, p16/Cdkn2a, p19/Arf and Trp53 genes and protein expression of p15/Cdkn2b and Cdk4 were analyzed in 12 cultures from mice hemizygous for Nf2 (asb-Nf2(KO3/+)) and 4 wild type counterparts (asb-Nf2(+/+)). We have found frequent inactivations of p16/Cdkn2a, p19/Arf (or P14/ARF) and p15/Cdkn2b, coinactivation of p16/Cdkn2a and p15/Cdkn2b and low rate of Trp53 mutations in both asb-Nf2(KO3/+) and asb-Nf2(+/+) mesothelioma cells. In both mouse and human mesothelioma cells, inactivation of the hortologous genes p16/Cdkn2a or P16/CDKN2A was due to deletions at the Ink4/Arf locus encompassing p19/Arf or P14/ARF, respectively. Loss of heterozygosity at the Nf2 locus was detected in 10 of 11 asb-Nf2(KO3/+) cultures and Nf2 gene rearrangement in one asb-Nf2(+/+) culture. These data show that the profile of TSG alterations in asbestos-induced mesothelioma is similar in mice and humans. Thus, the mouse mesothelioma model could be useful for human risk assessment, taking into account interindividual variations in genetic sensitivity to carcinogens.","title":"Similar tumor suppressor gene alteration profiles in asbestos-induced murine and human mesothelioma.","pubmedId":"16319530"}
