However, most of the Ag targets recognized by effective melanoma-reactive TILs remain elusive. In this study, patient 2369 experienced a complete response, including regressions of bulky liver tumor masses, ongoing beyond 7 y following adoptive TIL transfer. The screening of a cDNA library generated from the autologous melanoma cell line resulted in the isolation of a mutated protein phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 3B (PPP1R3B) gene product. The mutated PPP1R3B peptide represents the immunodominant epitope recognized by tumor-reactive T cells in TIL 2369. Five years following adoptive transfer, peripheral blood T lymphocytes obtained from patient 2369 recognized the mutated PPP1R3B epitope. These results demonstrate that adoptive T cell therapy targeting a tumor-specific Ag can mediate long-term survival for a patient with metastatic melanoma. This study also provides an impetus to develop personalized immunotherapy targeting tumor-specific, mutated Ags.","title":"Mutated PPP1R3B is recognized by T cells used to treat a melanoma patient who experienced a durable complete tumor regression.","pubmedId":"23690473"}
