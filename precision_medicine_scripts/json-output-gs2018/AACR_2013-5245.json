Alternative splicing of c-Kit produces one long variant, c-Kit(+), with a tetrapeptide GNNK located in the extracellular juxtamembrane domain, and one short variant, c-Kit(-), which lacks this sequence.In this study we characterize for the first time the function of the GNNK tetrapeptide sequence in melanoma. Our results show that step by step elimination of the GNNK tetrapeptide gradually increases receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, ubiquitination and downstream MAP kinase ERK activation. Successively increasing insert length, progressively leads to reduced melanoma cell survival during dacarbazine or rapamycin drug treatment. Our results indicate that the ratio between c-Kit isoforms might be useful as a prognostic marker for melanoma drug response.","title":"C-Kit isoforms predict melanoma drug sensitivity.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-5245"}
