In the somatochart after Parnell the fighters were placed more endomesomorphic than the hobby sportsmen. In Conrad\u0027s chessboard sample graphics the fighters concentrate on the leptomorph half including the metromorph corridor. Remarkable above all is here a placement of the weight class average values toward the pyknomorph hyperplastic quadrant. Also in Knussmann\u0027s body build typognosis the weight classes reveal a clear tendency from the coordinates -13/0.5 to -8.3/6.5 in the superleptomorph area. The body fat percentage varies from 17.4 % (male competitors) to 21.8 % (male non-competitors) and 21.2 % (female competitors) to 23.6 % (female non-competitors), which appears still optimizable in comparison to other martial arts collectives.","title":"[Somatotypes of male and female competitive Ju-Jutsuka].","pubmedId":"17240961"}
