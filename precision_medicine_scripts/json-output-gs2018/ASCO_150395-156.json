However, pts with active melanoma brain metastases (MBM) have been excluded from large Phase III trials and overall prognosis remains poor. Resistance to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) has been associated with reactivation of MAPK pathway and combination with MEK inhibitors (MEKi) has shown synergy and delays resistance. Cobimetinib is a potent MEK 1/2 inhibitor. In pts without MBM, the combination of vemurafenib + cobimetinib has improved response rates and PFS as compared to vemurafenib. Single agents BRAFi are safe to administer in pts with MBM resulting in objective intracranial responses. We aim to improve the outcomes of pts with MBM by assessing the clinical benefit of combination BRAFi/MEKi (vemurafenib + cobimetinib) in this population.  Methods:    This is a multi-center single arm, open label, Simon 2-stage Phase 2 study to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma with active MBM. Pts must have histologically confirmed BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma and \u003e 1 measurable intracranial target lesion. Prior BRAFi or MEKi is not allowed. Subjects will be given vemurafenib 960 mg PO BID and cobimetinib 60 mg PO QD for 21 days (28-day cycle). The primary objective is to determine the investigator-assessed objective intracranial response rate (OIRR) as measured by modified RECIST. The primary efficacy analysis is based on pts with BRAF V600E mutations and the study will accrue 29 pts in the 1st stage. If \u003e 6 pts experience an OIRR, acrrual to the 2nd stage will proceed to a total of 72 pts. Pts with non-V600E mutation are allowed but will not enter into the primary efficacy analysis. Secondary objectives include safety/tolerability, ORR (intracranial + extracranial), PFS, OS, duration of response, changes in relative apparent diffusion coefficient by MRI, volumetric response using 3D-MRI in a subset of pts, immune modulation and early markers of progression in peripheral blood, and health-related quality of life (by FACT-Br). The trial is open for enrollement.
