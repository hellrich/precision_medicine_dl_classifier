The particular composite of these two malignancies in ocular adnexa is to the best of our knowledge reported for the first time. The histological findings exhibited a solid anterior lid tumour infiltrating the skin and surrounding conjunctiva, as well as the orbicular muscles. The hyper- and parakeratotic keratin-rich squamous cell carcinoma was cytokeratin AE1/AE3 positive, had a slight atypia but an obvious invasion in the depth. Between the squamous cell carcinoma cells were islands of HMB45 and Melan-A positive melanoma cells with slight pigmentation, which demonstrated not only subcutaneous but also intraepithelial invasion.","title":"[Combined squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma of the eyelid].","pubmedId":"18712658"}
