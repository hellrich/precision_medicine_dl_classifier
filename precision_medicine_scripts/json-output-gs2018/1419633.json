In contrast, we failed to observe elevated p53 expression, indicating the absence of p53 mutation in seven choroidal naevi, a potentially premalignant condition that can progress to form malignant melanoma. For two choroidal melanomas, we demonstrated that high levels of p53 protein were accompanied by exon 7 mutations. The mutations were found at codon 238, TGT--\u003eTTT and codon 253, ACC--\u003eAGC. These observations suggest that acquisition of abnormalities of the p53 gene may be an important step in the development of malignant melanoma.","title":"Increased expression and mutation of p53 in choroidal melanoma.","pubmedId":"1419633"}
