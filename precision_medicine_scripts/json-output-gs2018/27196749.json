We sought to investigate the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of AMG 337, a potent and highly selective small molecule MET kinase inhibitor, in preclinical models of hepatocellular carcinoma. The antiproliferative activity of AMG 337 was evaluated across a panel of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in a viability assay. Daily oral administration was used to evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of AMG 337 in two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of hepatocellular carcinoma (LI0612 and LI1078). AMG 337 exerted potent antiproliferative activity against 2 of 40 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, namely, MHCC97H (IC50, 0.015 μmol/L) and HCCLM3 (IC50, 0.025 μmol/L). Both sensitive cell lines showed MET amplification (MET/CEN-7 \u003e2.0) assessed by FISH, and high MET expression (3+ IHC) assessed by IHC. AMG 337 potently inhibited p-MET in all cell lines with detectable levels of total MET. However, the dose-dependent inhibition of downstream effectors of HGF/MET signaling, including p-GAB1, p-AKT, and p-ERK, was limited to those cell lines sensitive to AMG 337 in a viability assay (MHCC97H and HCCLM3). AMG 337 significantly inhibited tumor growth at all doses tested in the MET-amplified and MET-high-expressing hepatocellular carcinoma PDX model LI0612 and had no effect on tumor growth in the non-MET-amplified and MET-low-expressing hepatocellular carcinoma PDX model LI1078. AMG 337 represents a promising and novel therapeutic strategy for targeting hepatocellular carcinomas with a dependence on HGF/MET signaling. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(6); 1227-37. ©2016 AACR.
