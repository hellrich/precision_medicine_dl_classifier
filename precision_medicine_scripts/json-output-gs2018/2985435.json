In medullary carcinoma of the thyroid both peptides are produced. We present here evidence for the existence in the human genome of a second CT gene, which is also expressed in human medullary thyroid carcinoma. This gene encodes a second human CGRP, differing from the known human CGRP in 3 of the 37 amino acids.","title":"A second human calcitonin/CGRP gene.","pubmedId":"2985435"}
