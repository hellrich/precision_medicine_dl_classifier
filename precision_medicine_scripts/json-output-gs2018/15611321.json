Previously we and others demonstrated a novel mechanism that allows tumors to escape from the host immune response by expressing PD-L1 which can negatively regulate immune response through the interaction with PD-1, an immunoinhibitory receptor belonging to the CD28 family. In this study, we report that hematogenous spread of poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma cells to the liver was inhibited in PD-1-deficient mice. After inoculation to spleen, PD-L1 was induced on tumor cells, which did not express PD-L1 in vitro. As compared with wild-type mice, intrasplenic injection of B16 cells into PD-1-deficient mice showed enhanced induction of effector T cells in spleen, prolonged T cell proliferation and cytokine production, and augmented homing of effector T cells to tumor sites in the liver, resulting in accumulation of effector T cells in the tumor sites. PD-1 blockade by genetic manipulation or antibody treatment inhibited not only hematogenous dissemination of B16 melanoma cells to the liver on the C57BL/6 background, but also dissemination of CT26 colon cancer cells to the lung on the BALB/c background. These results suggest that PD-1 blockade may be a powerful tool for treatment of hematogenous spread of various tumor cells.","title":"PD-1 blockade inhibits hematogenous spread of poorly immunogenic tumor cells by enhanced recruitment of effector T cells.","pubmedId":"15611321"}
