On a mixed C57BL/6 x 129P2/OlaHsd background, mice deficient for p19(Ink4d) exhibited defects in male reproductive function including testicular atrophy, alteration in serum follicle stimulating hormone, qualitative increase in germ cell apoptosis, and delayed kinetics of meiotic prophase markers (Zindy et al., 2001. Mol Cell Biol 21:3244-3255; Zindy et al., 2000. Mol Cell Biol 20:372-378). In this study, a quantitative assessment of these aspects of reproductive capacity demonstrated relatively mild deficits in p19(Ink4d-/-) males compared to controls. These effects did not dramatically worsen in older males although some seminiferous tubule defects were observed. Following marker-assisted backcrossing into the C57BL/6 background, p19(Ink4d-/-) males did not display defects in testis weights, sperm numbers, serum FSH, germ cell apoptosis, or kinetics of selected meiotic prophase markers. These studies indicate that a reduction in Ink4 family function by the loss of p19(Ink4d) is sufficient to induce mild reproductive defects in male mice with a mixed genetic background, but not in the C57BL/6 genetic background.","title":"Mice lacking cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p19Ink4d show strain-specific effects on male reproduction.","pubmedId":"17393423"}
