So far the occurrence of PAX5 alterations and their clinical correlation have not been investigated in adults with BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the rearrangements on 9p involving PAX5 and their clinical significance in adults with BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Eighty-nine adults with de novo BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled into institutional (n\u003d15) or GIMEMA (Gruppo Italiano Malattie EMatologiche dell\u0027Adulto) (n\u003d74) clinical trials and, after obtaining informed consent, their genome was analyzed by single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (Affymetrix 250K NspI and SNP 6.0), genomic polymerase chain reaction analysis and re-sequencing.\nPAX5 genomic deletions were identified in 29 patients (33%) with the extent of deletions ranging from a complete loss of chromosome 9 to the loss of a subset of exons. In contrast to BCR-ABL1-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia, no point mutations were found, suggesting that deletions are the main mechanism of inactivation of PAX5 in BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The deletions were predicted to result in PAX5 haploinsufficiency or expression of PAX5 isoforms with impaired DNA-binding. Deletions of PAX5 were not significantly correlated with overall survival, disease-free survival or cumulative incidence of relapse, suggesting that PAX5 deletions are not associated with outcome.\nPAX5 deletions are frequent in adult BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and are not associated with a poor outcome.","title":"The PAX5 gene is frequently rearranged in BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia but is not associated with outcome.
