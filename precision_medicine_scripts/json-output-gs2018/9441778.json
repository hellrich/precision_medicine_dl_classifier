Mutations were found in 12 (18.5%) of 65 cases. Ten of these 12 were single-base substitutions (8 missense and 2 nonsense mutations), whereas 2 were frame-shifting mutations. TP53 gene mutations correlated significantly with advanced surgical stage of disease (P \u003d 0.006) and unfavorable tumor histology types (P \u003d 0.003), whereas the association to myometrial wall invasion did not reach statistical significance (P \u003d 0.054). TP53 gene mutations also correlated significantly with allelic loss at TP53 locus (P \u003d 0.024), absence of estrogen (P \u003d 0.045) and progesterone receptors (P \u003d 0.001), DNA nondiploidy (P \u003d 0.002), and high S-phase fraction values (P \u003d 0.002). Our results suggest that inactivation of the TP53 checkpoint function is associated with disease transition into a stage of rapid progression and spread.","title":"Identification of TP53 gene mutations in uterine corpus cancer with short follow-up.","pubmedId":"9441778"}
