Only patients with oligometastatic stage IV disease amenable to complete ablation of all clinical disease at the time of ablation were included in the analysis. Overall survival and median progression-free survival periods were calculated.\nThirty-three patients with primary ocular or nonocular melanoma had 66 metastases treated in the lungs, liver, bones, or soft tissues. Eleven (33%) patients were on systemic medical therapy at the time of the procedure. The median survival time was 3.8 years (range, 0.5-10.5 years), with a 4-year estimated survival of 44.1% (95% CI, 28%-68%). Local recurrence at the ablation site developed in 15.1% (5 of 33) of the patients and 13.6% of the tumors (9 of 66). The median progression-free survival time was 4.4 months (95% CI, 1.4 months to 10.5 years), with an estimated 1-year progression-free survival of 30.3% (95% CI, 18%-51%). A subgroup analysis identified 11 patients with primary ocular melanoma and 22 with nonocular melanoma, with a median survival time of 3.9 years (range, 0.9-4.7 years) and 3.8 years (range, 0.5-10.5 years), respectively (P\u003d.58). There were no major complications and no deaths within 30 days of the procedure.\nSelective use of image-guided thermal ablation of oligometastatic melanoma may provide results similar to surgical resection in terms of technical effectiveness and oncologic outcomes with minimal risk.","title":"Recurrence and Survival Outcomes After Percutaneous Thermal Ablation of Oligometastatic Melanoma.","pubmedId":"26827235"}
