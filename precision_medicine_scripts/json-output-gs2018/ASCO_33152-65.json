NPI-0052 has a non-peptide based structure that appears to result in a unique proteasome inhibition (PI), signal transduction and safety profile. Preclinical data suggest NPI-0052 may demonstrate an improved therapeutic ratio, with significant activity in hematologic and solid tumor malignancies including MM resistant to bortezomib (BZ) and other agents. Methods: This phase I dose escalation study of NPI-0052 was conducted in patients (pts) with r/r MM, including after BZ and/or lenalidomide. Pts were treated with NPI-0052 IV weekly for 3 weeks in 4-week cycles. The dose of NPI-0052 was escalated utilizing a combination of accelerated titration and 3+3 designs. PI and PK were assayed after the 1st and 3rd doses. Results: 17 patients have been treated at doses ranging from 0.025 mg/m2 to 0.6 mg/m2 without reaching a MTD. One patient experienced reversible creatinine elevation associated with progression of light chain nephropathy at 0.075 mg/m2. Drug- related adverse events have consisted principally of mild-to-moderate fatigue, nausea and diarrhea. In this study at dose levels 0.75 and 0.15 mg/m2, the half-life \u003d 0.5 - 5.0 min; clearance \u003d 4.8  5.2 L/min and Vz \u003d 22.6  44.2 L. PI in whole blood demonstrates dose-dependent chymotrypsin-like inhibition up to 26% at 0.075 mg/m2. Of note, 2 patients remained on study for over 6 months and one year with stable disease and no significant toxicity. Importantly, NPI-0052 does not appear to induce peripheral neuropathy or myelosuppression. Conclusions: NPI-0052 was well tolerated in this study with escalation continuing to a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for r/r MM. The RP2D (0.7 - 0.8 mg/m2), PI and safety profiles of NPI-0052 have been defined in other diagnoses, and appear unique from BZ in spite of up to 100% proteasome inhibition. In this study, NPI-0052 has effects on PD, PK and may potentially confer clinical benefit at doses which are well below the MTD determined in the other trials. Additional trials in MM are being initiated, including with lenalidomide.","title":"Clinical trial of the novel structure proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 in patients with relapsed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM).","pubmedId":"ASCO_33152-65"}
