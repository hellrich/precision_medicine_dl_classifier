A ganglioside fraction was extracted and purified and the amount of each component ganglioside was assessed by thin-layer chromatography. GM3 was the dominant ganglioside species in the murine melanomas studied. Unlike human melanomas, the GD3 expression in mouse melanomas was low. GD3 and GM3 were major gangliosides in Bomirski hamster melanoma. Alkali-labile O-acetyl-GD3, a melanoma-specific ganglioside, was detected only in Bomirski melanoma. GD2, which in human melanoma is seen as a distinct signal of tumour progression, was not found in the animal melanomas studied. Melanosomes isolated from B16 and Bomirski melanomas contained GM3 and GD3 as their major ganglioside components. These data extend the group of common antigenic determinants shared by melanosomes and cell surface of pigment cells.","title":"Ganglioside profiles of experimental melanomas and of their melanosomal fractions.","pubmedId":"7620344"}
