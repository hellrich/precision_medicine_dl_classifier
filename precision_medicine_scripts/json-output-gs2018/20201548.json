The cancer therapeutic, doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), was conjugated to alkyne-functionalized poly(l-glutamic acid) (PGA(Alk)) via amide bond formation. PGA(Alk) and PGA(Alk+DOX) were assembled via hydrogen bonding with poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVPON) on planar and colloidal silica templates. The films were subsequently covalently stabilized using diazide cross-linkers, and PVPON was released from the multilayers by altering the solution pH to disrupt hydrogen bonding. After removal of the sacrificial template, single-component PGA(Alk) capsules were obtained and analyzed by optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The PGA(Alk) capsules were stable in the pH range between 2 and 11 and exhibited reversible swelling/shrinking behavior. PGA(Alk+DOX) was assembled to form drug-loaded polymer capsules with control over drug dose and position in the multilayer system (e.g., DOX in every layer or exclusively in layer 3). The drug-loaded capsules could be degraded enzymatically, resulting in the sustained release of active DOX over approximately 2 h. Cellular uptake studies demonstrate that the viability of cells incubated with DOX-loaded PGA(Alk) capsules significantly decreased. The general applicability of this modular approach, in terms of incorporation of polymer-drug conjugates in other click multilayer systems, was also demonstrated. Biodegradable click capsules with drug-loaded multilayers are promising candidates as carrier systems for biomedical applications.","title":"Biodegradable click capsules with engineered drug-loaded multilayers.","pubmedId":"20201548"}
