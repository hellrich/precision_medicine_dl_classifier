The purpose of the present study was to determine the presence of EphA2/ephrinA1 in mRNA and protein adenoid cystic carcinoma.\nmRNA and protein expression and protein product of EphA2 and ephrinA1 in adenoid cystic carcinoma was investigated using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. The tyrosine-phosphorylated state of EphA2 in adenoid cystic carcinoma cells was also investigated.\nGreater expression of EphA2 and ephrinA1 proteins and mRNA was detected in adenoid cystic carcinoma tissues. EphA2/ephrinA1 staining activities in adenoid cystic carcinoma were more significant than those in normal gland tissue (P \u003c .01). EphA2/ephrinA1 expression correlated significantly to the microvessel density (P \u003c .01). EphA2/ephrinA1 expression and microvessel density correlated with the clinical TNM stage, perineural invasion, and vascular invasion (P \u003c .05). In 3 histologic types of adenoid cystic carcinoma, the expression of EphA2/ephrinA1 and microvessel density was significantly greater in the solid type than in the cribriform and tubular types (P \u003c .01). We also noted that EphA2 was present in a nontyrosine-phosphorylated state.\nThe present study showed a high expression of EphA2/ephrinA1 in adenoid cystic carcinoma. EphA2/ephrinA1 can serve as a novel therapy target for adenoid cystic carcinoma.","title":"EphA2/ephrinA1 mRNA expression and protein production in adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary gland.","pubmedId":"23298804"}
