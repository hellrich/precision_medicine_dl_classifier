These biomarkers either reflect the target of the specific drug or some factor that might abrogate the effect of the drug. These targeted drugs are small-molecule inhibitors of a specific tyrosine kinase or a monoclonal antibody against a specific receptor. In this review, tissue biomarkers in NSCLC and companion diagnostics will be described, followed by an overview of targeted therapy to EGF/EGFR, HER2, VEGF/VEGFR, ALK, KRAS, BRAF, MEK and MET and some of the newer potential targets. Recent initiatives include the Lung Cancer Matrix Network, the BATTLE trials and the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium. There are a number of key clinical trials in targeted therapy in NSCLC which will be reporting during the next year.
