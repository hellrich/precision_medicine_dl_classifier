Classically, pilocytic astrocytomas are driven by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Recently described genetic aberrations involving this pathway are critical for tumorigenesis. Tandem duplication of 7q34 encodes BRAF and produces several KIAA1549-BRAF novel oncogenic fusions. Activating point mutations of BRAF, such as BRAF (V600E), also lead to pilocytic astrocytoma. Loss of the NF1 gene allows hyperactivation of the oncogene KRAS. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the novel molecular aberrations described in pilocytic astrocytomas and their clinical relevance for prognosis and treatment. The prognostic indications of these aberrations are discussed with regard to tumor location, tumor pathology, and patient age. A better understanding of the evolving molecular heterogeneity of pilocytic astrocytomas offers hope for developing molecularly targeted therapeutic armamentariums.","title":"Pilocytic astrocytoma: a disease with evolving molecular heterogeneity.","pubmedId":"23439714"}
