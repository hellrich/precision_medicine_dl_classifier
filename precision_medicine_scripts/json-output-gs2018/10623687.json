The influence of clinical, hematologic, therapeutic, and histologic parameters on event-free survival was assessed.\nBy univariate analysis, the following features were found to be associated with a poor prognosis: male sex (P \u003c.02), age older than 12 years (P \u003c.006), fever (P \u003c.0001), anemia (P \u003c.0025), high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P \u003c.0001), axial location (P \u003c.04), radiation therapy only for local control (P \u003c.009), type of chemotherapy regimen (P \u003c.0001), and poor chemotherapy-induced necrosis (P \u003c.001). After multivariate analysis, the adverse independent prognostic factors were male sex (P \u003c.04), age older than 12 years (P \u003c.001), fever (P \u003c.0002), anemia (P \u003c.02), high serum LDH level (P \u003c.0003), axial location (P \u003c.02), and type of chemotherapy regimen (P \u003c.0003). When the multivariate analysis was restricted to surgically treated patients, the adverse independent prognostic factors were poor chemotherapy-induced necrosis (P \u003c.0001), fever (P \u003c.015), anemia (P \u003c.02), and high serum LDH level (P \u003c.025).\nThe prognosis in cases of nonmetastatic Ewing\u0027s sarcoma is influenced by many different clinical and hematologic variables, all of which are to be considered when patients are being stratified according to the risk of relapse. In surgically treated patients, the most important prognostic factor is chemotherapy-induced necrosis.","title":"Prognostic factors in nonmetastatic Ewing\u0027s sarcoma of bone treated with adjuvant chemotherapy: analysis of 359 patients at the Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli.","pubmedId":"10623687"}
