In RTKs, ligand binding at the extracellular region triggers diverse cytoplasmic signaling cascades. Exactly how ligand binding is translated into specific signaling outcomes remains incompletely understood. In this issue, Doerner etÂ al. (2015) provide insights into a role that the juxtamembrane (JM) region of a representative ErbB kinase, EGFR, plays in this process. ","title":"Dialing in EGFR Signaling.","pubmedId":"26091165"}
