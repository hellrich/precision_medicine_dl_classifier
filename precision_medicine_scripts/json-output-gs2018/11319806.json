We examined whether TD of these two genes occurs simultaneously. We analyzed 13 AML and 2 myelodysplastic syndrome patients, including 6 adult patients with trisomy 11 and 9 pediatric patients with TD of the FLT3 gene, using RT-PCR followed by sequencing. Among these, TD of the MLL and FLT3 genes was found in 5 and 10 patients, respectively. Notably, TD of both the MLL and FLT3 genes (coduplication) was detected in two AML patients, who died 6 and 14 months after diagnosis. TD of these two genes in AML is rare; thus, coduplication of these genes in the same patient is predicted to be very rare. Although the mechanisms of TD of both genes are different, development of TD of both genes may be related to an unknown similar etiology in leukemia because the frequency of coduplication of these genes in a single patient is considered to be very low. Further studies of the coduplication of these genes in AML patients may lead to the clarification of its mechanism and clinical implications.","title":"Coduplication of the MLL and FLT3 genes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"11319806"}
