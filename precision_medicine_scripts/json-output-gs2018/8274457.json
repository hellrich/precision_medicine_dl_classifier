In order to analyze a possible clonal relationship between lesions of lymphomatoid papulosis and a Ki 1+ large cell anaplastic lymphoma in the same patient, a highly specific molecular probe for the malignant lymphoid clone of the large cell anaplastic lymphoma was developed. As a clone specific molecular marker, highly variable junctional sequences of rearranged T-cell receptor-gamma genes were used. An oligonucleotide primer complementary to these sequences was synthesized and, using the polymerase chain reaction, clone specific DNA was detected in all lesions of lymphomatoid papulosis of the patient. These results provide evidence for a clonal relationship between lesions of lymphomatoid papulosis and large cell anaplastic lymphoma developing in the same patient.","title":"Molecular evidence for a clonal relationship between lymphomatoid papulosis and Ki-1 positive large cell anaplastic lymphoma.","pubmedId":"8274457"}
