Recently, using an untargeted discovery approach and validation of key metabolites, we characterized the metabolomic profile of human breast tumors and uncovered intrinsic metabolite signatures in these tumors. Importantly, the oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), accumulated in a subset of tumors and human breast cancer cell lines. 2HG reached millimolar concentrations comparable to those in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas, despite the absence of IDH mutations. Instead, we discovered a significant association between increased 2HG levels and MYC pathway activation in breast cancer, which was corroborated in human mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells with inducible MYC overexpression and knockdown. Further analyses showed a global increase of DNA methylation in 2HG-high tumors and identified a poor survival tumor subtype with distinct DNA methylation, high tissue 2HG, and heightened occurrence in African-American patients. Tumors of this subtype had a stem cell-like transcriptional signature with WNT and MYC pathway activation. These tumors over-expressed glutaminase, suggesting a functional relationship between glutamine and 2HG metabolism in breast cancer. Accordingly, 13C-labeled glutamine was metabolized into 2HG in cells with aberrant 2HG accumulation, whereas pharmacologic and siRNA-mediated inhibition of glutaminase markedly reduced 2HG. Our findings highlight 2HG as a candidate breast cancer oncometabolite associated with MYC activation and poor prognosis.","title":"Aberrant accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate in human breast cancer with myc activation","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2952"}
