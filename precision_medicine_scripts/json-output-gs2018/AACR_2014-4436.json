How ribosomal proteins are neddylated and whether their neddylation plays any biological roles in cell growth and survival remains elusive. Here we report that ribosomal protein S27-like (RPS27L) and its family member RPS27 is subjected to neddylation by MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, and deneddylation by NEDP1. Disrupting neddylation with MLN4924, a newly discovered small molecule inhibitor of neddylation pathway, destabilized RPS27L and RPS27. Moreover, silencing of RPS27L and RPS27 sensitized breast cancer cells to MLN4924-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that neddylation stabilizes RPS27L and RPS27, and confers the survival of breast cancer cells.","title":"Neddylation of ribosomal protein S27-like and RPS27 regulates survival of breast cancer cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4436"}
