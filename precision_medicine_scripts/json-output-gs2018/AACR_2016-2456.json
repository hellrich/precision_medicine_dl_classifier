This finding raised the question of whether neuroblastoma pathogenesis was also accelerated by loss of a similar non-canonical function of NF1. To elucidate how loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene contributes to the development of high-risk neuroblastoma, we relied on a transgenic zebrafish model that overexpresses MYCN and harbors loss-of-function nf1 mutations. We show here that loss of nf1 leads to aberrant activation of RAS signaling in MYCN-induced neuroblastoma, promoting both increased tumor cell survival and rapid tumor cell proliferation. We demonstrate further that the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity of the (GAP)-related domain (GRD) is sufficient to suppress accelerated initiation of neuroblastoma in nf1-deficient zebrafish, even though this transgene is unable to restrict abnormal sympathoadrenal cell growth during embryologic development. Hence NF1 exhibits different activities in vivo in the normal development and tumorigenesis of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. Our findings establish nf1-deficient zebrafish that overexpress MYCN as an ideal animal model system for investigating new strategies to improve treatment of very high risk neuroblastomas with aberrant RAS-MAPK activation. We are currently performing high-throughput in vivo drug analysis using these zebrafish with primary tumors.","title":"Synergy between loss of NF1 and overexpression of MYCN in neuroblastoma is mediated by the GAP-related domain","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2456"}
