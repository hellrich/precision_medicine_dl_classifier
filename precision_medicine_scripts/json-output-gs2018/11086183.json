The cytologic and cytochemical aspects as well as the mature myeloid phenotype and hemostasis disorders were consistent with the diagnosis of APL. However, no t(15;17), or RARalpha gene, MLL gene or PML gene rearrangement was observed, or any other cytogenetic clonal abnormality. Coexpression on blast cells of CD33 and CD56 without CD34, CD16 or HLA-DR, suggested a myeloid/natural killer cell acute leukemia.","title":"Acute myeloid leukemia with hypergranular cytoplasm: a differential diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.","pubmedId":"11086183"}
