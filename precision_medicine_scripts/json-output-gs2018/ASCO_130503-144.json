Activating mutations in EGFR gene have been reported more frequently in never smokers than smokers with NSCLC. Female pts with squamous cell carcinomas of the lung (SQCLC) differ from males in that most females are life-long never/light smokers. However, molecular abnormalities in female pts with SQCLC have not been well-characterized.  Methods:  We retrospectively screened 38 female and 40 male pts with SQCLC in China from 2009 to 2012 to determine the prevalence of alterations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, PI3K, PTEN and FGFR1. Mutational analysis of EGFR, PIK3CA, KRAS and PTEN was performed using PCR-based DNA sequencing. FGFR1 amplification and ALKrearrangements were detected by FISH. A Cox regression model was used to assess the association between genomic mutation status and clinical features as well as OS.  Results:  10.3% (8/78) pts were detected with EGFR mutation, 6.4% (5/78) with KRAS mutation, 7.7% (6/78) with PI3K mutation and 6.4% (5/78) with FGFR1 abnormality. No one harbored PTEN or ALK alteration. PI3K mutation were less common (P\u003d0.026) in females compared to males.  Most of the pts (84.6%, 66/78) were stage IV at their first diagnosis and the median age was 57 year-old. There were significantly more male pts with a history of smoking than females (90% vs. 5.3%; P\u003c0.001). Median survival time of the whole cohort was 14.1 months. There was no statistical difference in OS based on gender. The median OS was 15.0 months in females and 13.6 months in males. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that no variable was the independent risk factor for OS.  Conclusions:  We demonstrated thatdespite for the significantly low percent of smoking history, targetable alterations in Chinese female pts with SQCLC were similar with those in males. Furthermore, we report for the first time that female pts with SQCLC might be a distinct disease entity with a particularly lower frequency of PI3K mutation. However, the lower frequency of PI3K mutation in Chinese female pts seems to have no influence on their OS. Due to the small sample size of the study, our data need to be confirmed in future studies.","title":"Identification of driver gene alterations in Chinese female patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.","pubmedId":"ASCO_130503-144"}
