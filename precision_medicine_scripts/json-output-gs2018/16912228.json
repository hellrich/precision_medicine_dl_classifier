The presence of FLT3 mutations as well as the allelic ratio of FLT3/ITD (ITD-AR, mutant-wild type ratio) may have prognostic significance. FLT3 mutation status of 630 children with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated on CCG-2941 and -2961 was determined, and ITD-AR was calculated for patients with FLT3/ITD. Clinical characteristics and outcomes for patients with FLT3/ALM and FLT3/ITD at varying ITD-ARs was determined and compared with those without FLT3 mutations (FLT3/WT). FLT3/ITD and FLT3/ALM were detected in 77 (12%) and 42 (6.7%) of the patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) was similar in patients with FLT3/ALM and FLT3/WT (51% versus 55%, P \u003d .862). In contrast, PFS at 4 years from study entry for patients with FLT3/ITD was inferior to that of patients with FLT3/WT (31% versus 55%, P \u003c .001). PFS decreased with increasing FLT3/ITD-AR (P \u003c .001), and those with ITD-AR greater than 0.4 had a significantly worse PFS than those with lower ITD-AR (16% versus 72%, P \u003d .001) or with FLT3/WT (55%, P \u003c .001). ITD-AR defines the prognostic significance in FLT3/ITD-positive AML, and ITD-AR greater than 0.4 is a significant and independent prognostic factor for relapse in pediatric AML.","title":"Clinical implications of FLT3 mutations in pediatric AML.","pubmedId":"16912228"}
