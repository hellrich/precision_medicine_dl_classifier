Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib showed improved PFS in patients with BRAF mutant melanoma (14.9 months). Furthermore, encorafenib showed superiority over vemurafenib. Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate cuAEs of melanoma patients treated with encorafenib and/or binimetinib and compare them to other BRAFi and MEKi induced cuAEs reported in the literature and observed in our control population. Methods: Patients treated with encorafenib, binimetinib, and other BRAFi/MEKi within approved clinical trials at the University Hospital of Zurich were collected and analyzed. Clinical and histological assessments were performed. Results: In 111 patients treated with BRAFi and/or MEKi, 212 related or possibly related cuAEs were identified. The percentage of patients with at least one cuAE is shown in the table below. The most frequent cuAEs observed in patients treated with encorafenib where palmoplantar hyperkeratosis (PPH, 50%), palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia (PPD, 53.8%) and alopecia (42.3%), whereas acanthopapillomas (83%), maculopapular exanthemas (63.3%), PPH and PPD (each 50%) prevailed in patients treated with vemurafenib. The most frequent observed cuAE in patients with dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy were maculopapular exanthemas (18.2%) and erythema-annulare-like eruptions (18.2%), with encorafenib/binimetinib combination therapy PPH (10.6%) respectivly. Conclusions: Encorafenib showed less hyperproliferative cuAEs as previous BRAFi. However, PPH and PPD seem to occur more often compared to the literature of other BRAFi. Both is supporting the argument that encorafenib is a second generation BRAFi with a longer dissociation time.
