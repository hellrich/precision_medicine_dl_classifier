This study reports molecular profiling of pts with advanced CRC in clinical practice.  Methods:  Pts with advanced CRC are enrolled in an ongoing institution-wide screening program. Molecular profiling is performed on FFPE archival tissues using a customized Sequenom panel (23 genes, 279 mutations) or the Illumina MiSeq TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (48 genes, 212 amplicons,  500x coverage) in our CLIA-certified laboratory.  PTEN negative tumor is defined by IHC with H score \u003c1. Demographic and clinical data are collected. Data was analyzed by chi-square test.  Results:  From March 2012 to August 2013, 132 pts were enrolled. One or more mutations were found in 50% (58/117) and 93%(14/15) of pts using Sequenom and MiSeq platforms respectively. Mutation rate was 40% for KRAS, 9% for PIK3CA, 2% for BRAF, 4% for NRAS, and 1% for each of CTNNB1, ERBB2, FGFR3, and EGFR. Mutations outside of codons 12/13 were found in 8% (4/53) of tumors with KRAS mutations. MiSeq showed additional mutations including ERBB4 (1/15), SMAD4 (1/15), FRXW7 (1/5), APC (5/15), and TP53 (12/15) in CRC. Co-mutation with KRAS was found in 58% (7/12) of pts with PIK3CA mutation and 80% (4/5) of pts with APC mutation. PTEN negative tumor was present in 20% (11/55) of pts. Presence of any mutation was significantly more common for pts with right-sided CRC (73%) compared to those with left-sided CRC (47%) and rectal CRC (38%) (p \u003c 0.01). There was a trend toward increased proportion of KRAS mutation in right-sided CRC (p\u003d0.06). There was no difference in age, ethnicity, gender, smoking status, stage at presentation, pathology grade, and response to first-line chemotherapy between right and left-sided CRC.  Conclusions:  Somatic alterations are common in advanced CRC. Targeted next-generation DNA sequencing identifies additional clinically relevant alterations than multiplex genotyping. Differences in the mutation profile of right and left-sided CRC tumors should be further investigated. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.","title":"Molecular profiling of patients (pts) with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC): Princess Margaret Cancer Centre experience.","pubmedId":"ASCO_122861-143"}
