We assessed the use of plasma NGS as a multi-purpose biomarker in advanced cancer pts referred for Phase I trial participation.  Methods:  Between 12/2012 and 12/2013, the plasma of pts with known mutations in tumor biopsies completing at least 2 courses of investigational targeted drug therapy was collected monthly until disease progression. cfDNA was extracted and NGS performed on the PGM platform with the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 starting from 10ng of DNA. This panel amplifies 207 amplicons covering 2,800 COSMIC mutations from 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressors.  Results:    The mean sequencing coverage across the experiments was 1,685x. Overall, 37 pts (colon (n\u003d11), ovary (10), breast (7), bladder (2), kidney (2), glioblastoma (2), endometrium/melanoma/penile/lung (n\u003d1) receiving inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (n\u003d23), MEK (n\u003d7), PARP (n\u003d3)) or others targets (n\u003d4) were included. TP53, KRAS and PIK3CA were the most commonly mutated genes in tumor biopsies. At Phase I trial initiation (C1D1), 20 of 37 pts (54%) had at least one mutation identified in cfDNA. Pts with only nodal or peritoneal disease were less likely to have a mutation detected: 1/6 (17%) having a cfDNA mutation. Thirty-six different mutations were identified at C1D1 in 20 pts: TP53 (n\u003d15) with an allele frequency (AF) ranging from 2% to 57%; KRAS (n\u003d6; AF 4-51%); PIK3CA (n\u003d6; AF 5-58%); APC (n\u003d4; AF\u003d15-33%); SMAD4, HRAS, FBXW7, CDKN2A, ATM (n\u003d1). Three mutations identified in cfDNA were not identified in tumor: TP53 (Y220C; AF 4.5%), ATM (R337C; AF 18%), TP53(R342fs*2; AF 23%). In 15 pts, subsequent AF mutation monitoring showed that 75% (3/4) of pts with a \u003e30% decrease in AF at C2D1 compared to baseline had stable disease or a partial response by RECIST after 2 cycles. Conversely 87.5% (7/8) of pts with an increasing AF \u003e20% at C2D1 had progressive disease by RECIST after 2 cycles, while a stable AF at C2D1 (-20%\u003c AF \u003c+30%)   was associated with SD in 2/3 pts.  Conclusions:  NGS of plasma is feasible even with low DNA input and may be of utility as a predictive and response biomarker.","title":"Targeted deep sequencing from circulating plasma DNA as a multipurpose biomarker in pts (pts) referred for phase I trials.","pubmedId":"ASCO_129717-144"}
