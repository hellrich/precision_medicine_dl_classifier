Accounting for less than 5% of all skin cancers, melanoma is associated with approximately 75% of skin cancer-related mortality. Early detection of melanoma with surgical resection remains one of the critical factors determining favorable clinical outcomes for melanoma. Up to now, many imaging methods, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography/CT, have been used in the diagnosis of melanoma and metastases. This article reviews the application of imaging methods in metastatic melanoma.","title":"Role of imaging methods in metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"23007153"}
