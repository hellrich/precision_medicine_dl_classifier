The results of an FLT3 mutation test, which can be influenced by several variables, need to be interpreted according to the clinical setting and there is a need for internationally standardized FLT3 mutation assays. Because of the lack of prospective studies, the role of allogeneic transplantation as consolidation therapy is still somewhat controversial, but the preponderance of evidence suggests that transplantation in first remission, if possible, is probably the best option. Clinically useful FLT3 inhibitors are hopefully on the near horizon and are being studied in the context of current treatment paradigms.
