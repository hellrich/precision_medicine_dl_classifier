ALDH enzymes metabolize toxic aldehydes, and are highly expressed in somatic and cancer stem cells (CSCs), although their function in stem cells is not fully understood. In a small molecule screen coupled with target ID, we recently discovered that clinically active 5-nitrofurans (5-NFNs) are substrates of ALDH2 (Zhou et al., 2012). 5-NFNs are a class of pro-drug widely used to treat bacterial and parasitic infections where their relative specificity is driven by nitroreductases, but little is known about the enzymes that bio-activate 5-NFNs in humans. Recent clinical cancer research has found that the 5-NFN nifurtimox has anti-cancer properties and it is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00601003), however the mechanism underlying this anti-cancer activity is unknown.In melanoma and other cancers, ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 are highly expressed in CSCs. We find that cancer cell lines are highly sensitive to 5-NFNs in cell viability assays, where we use a logarithmic drug dose range and assess cell viability by PrestoBlue (e.g. A375 melanoma cells EC50 \u003d 86nM). To test if ALDH1 isoforms are substrates of 5-NFNs, we preformed in vitro activity assays by monitoring NADH production ( \u003d 340nm). We find that the clinically active 5-NFNs nifuroxazide and nifurtimox, in addition to our own newly synthesised 5-NFNs, are competitive substrates for human ALDH1A3 activity in vitro (p\u003c0.05). Notably, nifuroxazide was not a substrate for ALDH2, suggesting that nifuroxazide may show selectivity toward ALDH1. Consistent with our enzymatic activity assays, we find that 5-NFNs are competitive substrates for ALDH activity in melanoma cells by Aldefluor in vivo, with 5-NFNs displaying a prolonged competitive inhibition compared with the known inhibitor, DEAB. Importantly, no-nitro control compounds show no activity toward ALDH enzymes in vitro or in vivo. Computational docking studies reveal that 5-NFNs have the potential to fit within the interior of the ALDH enzymatic cavity and interact with the catalytic cysteine, thereby offering a potential mechanism for 5-NFN bio-activation. Kinetic living-cell imaging (IncuCyte ZOOM) reveals that ALDH1A3 siRNA transfected A375 cells are protected from 5-NFN toxicity (p\u003e0.05) and apoptosis (DRAQ7: p\u003c0.0001), demonstrating a functional role for ALDH1A3 in mediating 5-NFN activity in cancer cells.Our work demonstrates a novel and biologically relevant 5-NFN-ALDH1 interaction in cancer cells. We propose 5-NFNs have the potential to target ALDHhigh CSCs within a tumour and advance the repurposing of clinical 5-NFN pro-drug antibiotics as anti-cancer therapeutics.","title":"Targeting cancer stem cells using ALDH-dependent 5-nitrofuran prodrugs","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3796"}
