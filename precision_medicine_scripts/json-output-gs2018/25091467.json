Targeting ErbBs by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may therefore limit esophageal cancer cell migration. Here, we studied the impact of TKIs on ErbB dimerization, cell signaling pathways, and cell migration in three esophageal cell lines: OE21 (ESCC), OE33 (EAC), and Het-1A (non-neoplastic esophageal epithelium). In OE21 cells, the TKIs erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib slightly affected epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR/EGFR, but not EGFR/HER2 dimerization as detected by in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA). Still, TKIs inhibited ERK1/2, Akt, STAT3, and RhoA activity in OE21 cells, as assessed by Western blot, antibody arrays, and Rho GTPase effector pull-down assays. This was accompanied by reduced OE21 cell migration, induction of focal adhesions, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, as shown by Oris™ migration assay and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/phalloidin staining. In contrast, in OE33 cells, only lapatinib decreased STAT5, Src family kinase (SFK), and FAK activity as well as β-catenin expression. This impeded cell migration and induced morphological changes in OE33 cells. No alterations were seen for the non-neoplastic Het-1A cells. Thus, we identified the ErbB signaling network as regulator of esophageal cancer cell\u0027s actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, and cell migration. ErbB targeted TKIs therefore also limit ESCC and EAC cell motility and migration.\nClinical tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) reduce esophageal cancer cell migration. Loss of cell migration is linked to reduced Akt, ERK1/2, STAT (3 or 5), FAK, SFKs, and RhoA activity. Clinical TKIs act via distinct signaling in the two main histotypes of esophageal cancer.","title":"ErbB targeting inhibitors repress cell migration of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma cells by distinct signaling pathways.","pubmedId":"25091467"}
