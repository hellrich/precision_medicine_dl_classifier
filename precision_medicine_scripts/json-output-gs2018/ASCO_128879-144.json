The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and increasing availability of new targeted therapeutics raise the question of how broader use of testing will impact care in the community setting.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients (pts) seen at a network of community oncology practices whose tumors were tested with NGS for actionable mutations in AKT1, ALK, BRAF, DDR2, EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR1/3, GNA11, GNAQ, MAP2K1, HRAS, KDR, KIT, KRAS, MET, NF1, NRAS, NTRK1/2/3, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN, RET, STK11, TSC1, and TSC2. Under IRB approval, data were collected on diagnosis, date of testing, treatments, mutational results, treatment outcomes, and survival.  Results:   632 pts had NGS, of whom 360 harbored actionable mutations (57%). Of these, 301 were included for review: 59 were excluded based on disease stage or insufficient clinical data. There were 26 different cancer types; lung, colorectal and breast cancers represented over half.  As of December 2013, 45% of pts had started new therapies after NGS results were available. Mutational testing guided treatment in 34% of these pts, with over half enrolling on clinical trials targeting specific mutations.  A minority (6.6%) was treated off label with FDA approved medications targeting the mutations. Conclusions:   When performed in a timely manner, NGS had a clinically meaningful impact on treatment planning in one third of pts. The availability of molecularly targeted clinical trials played a significant role in the importance of the testing. Our data provide an initial view of how NGS can impact treatment decision making in the community setting.Total number pts632Patients with actionable mutations57% (n\u003d360)Eligible for analysis based on advanced stage and availability of clinical information48% (n\u003d301)Were test results available before the latest treatment was started?Yes (45%, n\u003d136)No (55%, n\u003d165)Did results guide subsequent therapy?Treatment status?Yes (34%, n\u003d34)No (66%, n\u003d102)Still on  last treatmentNot on treatmentHospice/diedOtherClinical trialStandard of careOff-label  usePatient alive?52%22%26%Yes 76%No 24%30%28%37%5%","title":"Impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on treatment decisions in the community oncology setting.","pubmedId":"ASCO_128879-144"}
