An antigen driven stimulation of T-lymphocytes is expected to induce not only cell membrane activation molecules but also a unique pattern of cytokine gene transcripts. These cytokines are relevant modulators and potent effectors of immune responses, and therefore play a crucial role in tumor-immune system interaction. The gene transcription of interleukin(IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-10 and interferon(IFN)-gamma of lymphocyte infiltrated, freshly excised tumor specimens from 10 renal cell carcinomas and 6 melanomas were investigated by reverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Autologous, peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) and healthy tissue of the affected organs served as controls. In all samples the transcription of the beta-actin gene as a methodological control turned out to be positive. In contrast, no cytokine gene transcription was detected in healthy tissue specimens and PBMC. IL-2 transcripts were detectable in no melanomas but in half of the renal tumor samples. IL-10 never transcribed in melanomas but was positive in 7 out of 10 renal cell carcinomas. In only 2 respectively 1 of the resected tissue probes was transcription of IL-4 and IFN-gamma detected. IL-7 was positive in 1 melanoma and in 6 urological neoplasias. The most impressive fact is the frequent transcription of the inhibiting factor IL-10 in renal cell carcinomas (7/10). This pattern of cytokine gene transcription may explain functional deficits of TIL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"[Tumor-immune system interaction in renal cell carcinoma and melanomas.
