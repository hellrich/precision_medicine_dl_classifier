We confirm in 2562 patients with acute myeloid leukemia our previous observation that NPM1 mutations and cytoplasmic nucleophosmin are mutually exclusive of recurrent genetic abnormalities. Taken together, these findings make NPMc+ acute myeloid leukemia a good candidate for inclusion in the upcoming World Health Organization classification.","title":"NPM1 mutations and cytoplasmic nucleophosmin are mutually exclusive of recurrent genetic abnormalities: a comparative analysis of 2562 patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"18268276"}
