Tissues from 120 patients with a head and neck SCC were studied for the expression of p16 and p53, and the Brandwein-Gensler (BG) histological risk assessment model. p16 positivity and p53 normal expression were significantly correlated with non-smoking, an earlier T stage and a non-keratinising morphology. The BG risk score was not associated with p16 or p53 expression; p16 expression was associated with a lymphocytic T-cytotoxic response. BG risk score was significantly correlated with overall survival and progression-free survival, while neither p16 nor p53 expression were associated with prognosis. p16 and p53 expression are associated with the histological subtype and the T stage even in non-oropharyngeal-restricted tumours. The BG risk score is not correlated with p16 or p53 and retains its power in non-site-specific SCCs.
