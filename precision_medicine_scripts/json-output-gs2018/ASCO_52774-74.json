As a consequence, MAPK signaling is frequently activated. To correlate clinical benefit of a MEK inhibitor with the mut status, we performed a genomic study using tumors of patients (pts) enrolled in a clinical study of AZD6244 (a selective MEK inhibitor)-containing combination regimens. Methods: Pts  18 years of age with advanced solid tumors and a WHO performance status 0-1 were enrolled in a phase I trial of AZD6244 in combination with one of 3 drugs in 3-week (q3w) treatment cycles: dacarbazine (DTIC) 1000 mg/m2 iv q3w or docetaxel (Doc) 75 mg/m2 iv q3w or temsirolimus (Tems) 25 mg iv weekly. Oral AZD6244 was given at 50-75 mg twice daily continuously. Responses were assessed every 2 cycles per RECIST. In pts with available archived tumor samples, BRAF and NRAS were genotyped by pyrosequencing. Results: Among 25 pts with metastatic melanoma who received one of the combination regimens, tumor samples from 18 pts (14 in DTIC, 3 in Doc, 1 in Tems arms) were analyzed. NRAS sequencing on one sample was unsuccessful. Median age was 58 and, among these pts, 5 (28%) and 9 (50%) pts had a response and stable disease, respectively. Overall, 9 (50%) pts harbored BRAF mut (8 V600E; 1 nonclassical R600 nonsense mut), and 4 (22%) harbored NRAS mut (2 Q61R; 1 Q61K; 1 G12S). These muts were mutually exclusive in each case. Of interest, all 5 responders had BRAF mut, and none of the pts with BRAF mut had early disease progression. Presence of BRAF mut was significantly associated with both clinical responses and increased time to progression (TTP). While the number of patients analyzed is small, the trend toward clinical benefit in pts with BRAF mut is inferred. Conclusions: Our analyses showed a trend toward response and clinical benefit in patients who harbor a BRAF gene mut.
