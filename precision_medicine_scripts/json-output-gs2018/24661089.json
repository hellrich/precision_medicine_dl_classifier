The clinical outcomes of paediatric patients with t(6;9) with and without FLT3-ITD treated on six consecutive cooperative trails were evaluated. In contrast to patients without t(6;9), those with t(6;9) had a significantly lower complete remission rate, higher relapse rate (RR), and poor overall survival (OS). Within t(6;9) patients, those with and without FLT3-ITD had an OS of 40% and 27% respectively (P \u003e 0·9), demonstrating that t(6;9) is a high-risk cytogenetic feature in paediatric AML and its clinical impact is independent of the presence of FLT3-ITD.
