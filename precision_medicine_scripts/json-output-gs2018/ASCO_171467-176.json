Analysis of malignant transformation of melanocytes and melanoma progression frequently utilizes immortalized melanoma cell lines that propagated in the laboratory. We studied the diversity of genetic mutations in the MAPK pathway in established melanoma cell lines and compared it to that of human melanoma tissue samples. Methods: We screened 30 well-established human melanoma cell lines, the majority of which were derived from melanoma metastases at dermal or nodal locations, for 85 mutations found within the AKT1, BRAF, KIT, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and PTEN genes by RT-PCR. We then interrogated 263 melanoma genomes available in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) skin cutaneous melanoma dataset for the presence and frequency of these mutations. Mutational frequencies were determined by sorting the data in MS Excel. Results: BRAF was mutated in 39% of TCGA melanoma genomes and 53% of cell line genomes. NRAS genes were mutated in 26% of TCGA samples and 13% of cell lines. Cell lines were 34 times more likely to bear a KIT mutation than TCGA samples. Mutations in each of the 8 tested genes except PTEN were found in TCGA genome samples, while cell lines contained mutations in BRAF, KIT, NRAS, PTEN, and lacked any of the tested mutations in AKT1, KRAS, HRAS, PIK3CA. Cell lines exhibited a higher frequency of unique mutational combinations. Both BRAF and KIT were mutated in 13% of cell lines, and each of NRAS and KIT; NRAS and PTEN; and NRAS, BRAF and PTEN in 3.3% of cell lines; all these combinations were absent in TCGA melanoma genomes. Mutations in PIK3CA combined with either BRAF or NRAS were found in 1% of TCGA samples but absent from cell lines. Conclusions: These data indicate that mutational status and frequency of individual mutations and mutation combinations found in melanoma cell lines can diverge from that observed in clinical tissue specimens. Additional changes observed in cell lines may provide insight into evolutionary mutations in progressive melanoma. Understanding of genetic profiles of cell lines may provide additional information in their sensitivity to pathway inhibitors.","title":"Genomic diversity in established melanoma cell lines and human melanoma tumors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_171467-176"}
