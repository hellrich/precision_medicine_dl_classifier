The significant elevation of S-100 and GFAP was revealed in glioblastoma (G IV) patients compare to the patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (G III), benign meningioma (GI), celebral metastasis and healthy controls. The concentration of S-100 in blood serum of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, benign meningioma, and celebral metastasis did not significantly differ among themselves, and in relation to the control group there was a significantly increase only in patients with cerebral metastasis. GFAP was characterized by high frequency of its detection in patients with glioblastoma (83%) compare to other groups of patients and healthy donors, in which it was practically undetectable. These data suggest the possibility of using GFAP as a marker of glioblastoma and S-100- as an additional biochemical criteria of cerebral lesions in oncology patients.","title":"Biochemical markers of brain tumours.","pubmedId":"24640102"}
