We describe clinical and histological features of malignant melanoma in five transplant patients. All transplant patients with melanoma arising post-transplantation had a previous history of skin cancer. Two had a history of internal organ malignancy. Three patients had thick malignant melanomas (Clark level III or higher, or \u003e0.76 mm Breslow thickness). Lymph-node metastases occurred in one patient with cutaneous melanoma. Local cutaneous metastases occurred in one patient. Mean duration from transplantation to melanoma was 15.6 years. Two cases of aggressive metastatic melanoma responded well to cessation of immunosuppression. Three patients with nonmetastatic disease responded well to conventional complete excision and continuation of immunosuppression.","title":"Malignant melanoma in transplant patients: review of five cases.","pubmedId":"16780495"}
