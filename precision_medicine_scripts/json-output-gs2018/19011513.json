However, only a small subgroup of melanoma pedigrees harbour CDKN2A or CDK4 germline mutations. It is possible that other types of CDKN2A rearrangements, not detectable by routine PCR-based approaches, are involved in a fraction of melanoma cases negative for point sequence changes. In order to gain insights on the possible role of CDKN2A large deletions or duplications in melanoma susceptibility in the Italian population, we screened a series of 124 cutaneous malignant melanoma families referred to five national medical/cancer genetics centres. All probands were negative for point mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4. All samples were tested by MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification), and the results were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR in a subset of 53 cases. No genomic rearrangements were detected in this series, one of the largest so far investigated. These data suggest that large deletions/duplications in the CDKN2A locus are infrequently involved in the development of familial melanoma in the Italian population. Based on these results, routine search for these rearrangements in CDKN2A- and CDK4-mutation negative melanoma families is not warranted, although it would be reasonable to pursue it in selected cases with very strong family history and/or showing linkage to 9p21.","title":"Genomic rearrangements of the CDKN2A locus are infrequent in Italian malignant melanoma families without evidence of CDKN2A/CDK4 point mutations.","pubmedId":"19011513"}
