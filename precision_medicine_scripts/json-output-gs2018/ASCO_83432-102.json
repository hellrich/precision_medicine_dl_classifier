We sought to determine the association between p16 status and response/survival in a prospective phase II clinical trial in patients with HNSCC.  Methods:     Sixty-three eligible patients with operable stage III/IV HNSCC participated in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) phase II trial of induction chemotherapy with weekly cetuximab, paclitaxel and carboplatin x 6 followed by  chemoradiotherapy with weekly cetuximab. paclitaxel, carboplatin.  P16 protein expression status was assessed using automated quantitative protein analysis (AQUA). The objectives of this analysis were to determine whether p16 status was correlated with response to treatment, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Fishers exact tests were used to compare response rates whereas survival distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method using  log rank test to compare survival curves between p16 categories.  Results:     The median p16 tumor mask AQUA score was 42.9 (Range\u003d6-491). Of the 63 tumors included in this study, 38 (60.3%) had sufficient tissue for analysis of p16.  Using a cut-off score of 80, 16 out of 38 eligible cases (i.e., 42%) were classified as p16+. Almost 58% of the responders had low p16 tumor mask AQUA scores. However, there was no significant association between p16 status and objective response (p-value\u003d1.00). Moreover, 2-year PFS for p16 high and low categories were, respectively, 0.74 [95% CI (0.53, 0.96)] and 0.58 [95% CI (0.37, 0.79)]. The 2-year overall survival rates for p16 high and low categories were, respectively, 0.81 [95% CI (0.61, 1.00)] and 0.77 [95% CI (0.60, 0.95)].  Conclusions:    There was no significant association between p16 AQUA status and response/ survival in this small subset of patients treated in the prospective E2303 study.  Large prospective studies will determine the association between p16 status and response to cetuximab in HNSCC.","title":"p16 protein status and response to treatment in a prospective clinical trial (ECOG 2303) of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_83432-102"}
