In the rabbit thrombosis model using activated human serum as the thrombogenic challenge, the effect of LAH on 10\u0027 and 20\u0027 stasis was studied. At 10\u0027 stasis, 150 micrograms/kg of LAH reduced thrombus formation by 67% and total prevention was achieved at 500 micrograms/kg. At 20\u0027 stasis, 150 micrograms/kg was totally ineffective, 500 micrograms/kg was partially effective and 1000 micrograms/kg was required to achieve complete prevention of thrombosis. Mean peak circulatory level following infusion of 500 micrograms/kg of LAH was found to be 1.6 micrograms/ml by heparin cofactor II based assay and 0.13 iu/ml by anti-factor Xa assay. Thrombin generation tests of the same post injection samples showed an 80% reduction in thrombin production when compared with pre-injection samples. At 2.5 mg/kg, the mean bleeding time ratio (challenge:control) measured in the rabbit ear template model was 1.25 (cf saline control 0.88). Compared with results from previous studies on unfractionated heparin and dermatan sulphate, LAH is approximately 6 times less effective than UFH but 5 times more potent than dermatan sulphate. Since the mean bleeding time for UFH at 2.5 mg/kg was previously found to increase nearly two fold over the control value, LAH may present a lesser haemorrhagic risk than UFH. These data suggest that LAH is more effective in directly preventing venous thrombosis than dermatan sulphate. Although LAH is not as effective as UFH on a weight basis in the impairment of thrombogenesis, it may carry significantly lower bleeding risk.","title":"Low affinity heparin is an antithrombotic agent.","pubmedId":"8191399"}
