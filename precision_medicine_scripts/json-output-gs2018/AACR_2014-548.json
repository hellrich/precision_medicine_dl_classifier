{"genes":["CEP 3","CEP 3"],"publicationTypes":["2014 AACR Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"To investigate the clinical application value of centromere of chromosome 3 and 17 (CEP 3, CEP 17) DNA probes in Kazakh esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients molecular pathological diagnosis and prognosis.Forty patients with ESCC who received radical surgical treatment and 10 cases of normal specimen in control group were enrolled in this study. Touch preparations of fresh cancer and normal tissue were made and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique were used to count the copy numbers of CEP 3 and CEP 17, abnormalities were analyzed comparing with routine pathological diagnosis.FISH analysis revealed that abnormal copy numbers of CEP 3, CEP 17 (aneuplody) were observed in 40 cases. CEP 3 and CEP 17 polyploidy rates were 42%, 40.5% in well-differentiated, 62.9%, 46.8% in moderately differentiated, and 76.95%, 63.5% in poorly differentiated ESCC respectively. These were significantly different between poorly differentiated, moderately differentiated and well-differentiated groups (p\u003c0.05, p\u003c0.05), and the polyploidy rates were also significantly higher in the group with lymph node metastasis comparing to the group without lymph node metas-tasis (CEP 3, p\u003d0.0001; CEP 17, p\u003d0.012).The CEP 3, 17 variations were shown to be correlated with the level of differentiation and lymph node metastasis in ESCC. Therefore, there DNA probes may be the predictive biological marker in the prognosis of patients with ESCC. In addition, being an objective and qualitative method, the technology of FISH can detect CEP 3, 17 variations in the genetic diagnosis of Kazakh ESCC.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.","title":"CEP 3/CEP 17 in the genetic diagnosis and its prognostic relevance of Kazakh esophageal cancer patients","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-548"}
