Recurrent somatic mutations in the genes encoding for the metabolic enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 have recently been identified in patients with acute myeloid leukemias, chrondrosarcomas, cholangiocarcinomas and glioblastomas. Point mutations in IDH lead to production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). 2HG acts as a potent inhibitor of enzymes involved in the removal of chromatin marks associated with transcriptional repression (DNA and Histone H3K9 methylation). Excess 2HG leads to impaired differentiation but very little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here we use a well established model of cellular differentiation, the differentiation of 10T1/2 fibroblasts into myofibers by the lineage-specifying transcription factor MyoD to study the mechanisms by which IDH mutations impair differentiation. We show that 5-azacytidine induced differentiation of 10T1/2 cells is impaired when mutant IDH2 is expressed and that IDH2 mutations impair the ability of MyoD expression to reprogram 10T1/2 cells into myofibers. We propose that the metabolic landscape of undifferentiated cells determines the ability of the lineage determining factor MyoD to trigger differentiation and that the undifferentiated state of cancer cells is dependent on their unique metabolic profile. Further work aims to a) define the effects of mutant IDH1/2 on the ability of MyoD to program muscle differentiation, b) determine the nature of the tumorigenic effects of IDH1/2 mutations in 10T1/2 cells and c) identify molecular pathways that can overcome differentiation blocks upon activation. Insight from these experiments will outline the mechanism(s) by which metabolic alterations, in the form of 2HG, impair differentiation and drive tumorigenesis. They will also serve as a platform for the identification of metabolic alterations that trigger differentiation. These mechanisms could prove to be novel and readily targetable processes in an array of poorly differentiated and aggressive cancer subtypes where other pharmacological approaches have failed.","title":"Effects of metabolic stressors on cellular differentiation","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2877"}
