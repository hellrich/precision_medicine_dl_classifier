Prognosis worsens dramatically once disease metastasizes distantly.  Targeting molecular changes involved in metastasis may be an effective strategy to slow disease progression.  In this study, we investigated changes in theranostic biomarkers that may be important for MM, which may provide insight into new therapeutic strategies.   Methods:  1,369 cutaneous melanoma cases referred to Caris Life Sciences between 2009 and 2013 were evaluated.  Biomarker profiling included a combination of sequencing (Sanger, NGS), protein expression (IHC), and gene amplification (CISH or FISH).   Results:  We examined profiling data from 1,369 cutaneous melanomas (355 primary skin and 1014 skin metastases).  Differential expression between primary and MM using IHC included loss of expression of cKIT, ERCC1, PTEN, SPARC, TOPO1, and TUBB3 (p-values range \u003c0.001 to 0.02) in MM, compared to primary skin specimens.  Conversely, MET, MRP1, and TOP2A were overexpressed (p-values: 0.006, 0.01 and \u003c0.001) in MM.  MET overexpression was observed in 15% of BRAF-mutated MM in our series. EGFR is amplified by ISH in 35% of the MM set vs. 6% in primary specimens (p\u003c0.001).  NGS revealed increased BRAF, PTEN, and PIK3CA mutation rates in MM (p-values: 0.02, 0.02, 0.09), implicating PTEN/PIK3CA in disease progression.  Of interest, PTEN mutations co-occurred with BRAF mutations in 13% of patients.     Conclusions:  Molecular changes observed in MM, as detected by IHC, ISH, and sequencing may provide actionable targets that are important for disease progression.  Using a multiplatform approach, we identified subgroups of BRAF-mutated patients that exhibit MET overexpression, EGFR amplification, and PTEN mutations.  Since MET and EGFR have been implicated in resistance to BRAFi, our data support using a dual-targeted treatment strategy.  Since prognosis varies based on dissemination site, further investigation to determine site-specific metastases would be of high interest.","title":"Biomarker patterns of metastatic melanoma with implications for therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_134703-144"}
