Our experience with these lesions indicates that these diseases can be differentiated immunohistologically by the standard peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique, using antibodies directed against keratin (KER), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and S-100 protein (S-100). Based on a study of 11 cases of Bowen\u0027s disease, eight cases of Paget\u0027s disease, and nine cases of malignant melanoma in situ, we conclude that the atypical clear cells of Bowen\u0027s disease stain only with antibodies to KER; those of Paget\u0027s disease, exclusively with antibodies to CEA; and those of malignant melanoma in situ, with antibodies to S-100. Additionally, we report a case in which clinical and histologic findings suggested Bowen\u0027s disease, but immunohistologic findings supported the diagnosis of Paget\u0027s disease.","title":"Bowen\u0027s disease, Paget\u0027s disease, and malignant melanoma in situ.","pubmedId":"2422766"}
