Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a negative regulator of T cell activation, which competes with CD28 for B7.1/B7.2 binding with a greater affinity. Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, has shown positive efficacy in a pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and was approved by FDA. However, the cost of monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics might limit the number of patients treated. To develop a novel therapeutics specifically targeting CTLA-4, we constructed a DNA vaccine by cloning the sequence of CTLA-4 fused with a transmembrane domain sequence of placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) into a mammalian expression plasmid, pVAC-1. Immunization with the resulting construct, pVAC-1-hCTLA-4, elicited antibody specific to human CTLA-4 with cross reactivity to murine CTLA-4, which was sufficient for inhibiting B16F10 tumor growth in c57BL/6 mice in the absence of measurable toxicity. Coupling liposome with pVAC-1-mCTLA-4 could break tolerance to self-antigen in BALB/c mice and induce potent immunity against murine CTLA-4, and suppress growth of subcutaneous renal cell carcinoma (Renca).","title":"A DNA vaccine against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) prevents tumor growth.","pubmedId":"24041689"}
