Two cases of this tumor involving Gasserian ganglion were reported. The first case was a 47 year old female who developed paresis of the right side fifth cranial nerve. The plain skull X-ray of the axial view demonstrated enlargement of the right sided foramen ovale. The tumor was removed exploring the middle fossa extradurally, however its extention through the foramen ovale remained behind. A small induration was found at the base of the oral cavity postoperatively, and the biopsy revealed characteristic findings of adenoid cystic carcinoma histologically. Radiation therapy was followed by considerable clinical improvement.","title":"[Adenoid cystic carcinoma extended to Gasserian ganglion-report of two cases (author\u0027s transl)].","pubmedId":"186724"}
