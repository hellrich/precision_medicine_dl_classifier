Histologically, the lesion was characterized by a heavy lymphocytic infiltrate with large CD30+ cells. The lesion was highly suggestive of cutaneous involvement by malignant lymphoma, but complete regression was observed after cessation of gemcitabine. Although rarely reported, gemcitabine therapy can induce skin lesions. Pathologists should be aware of this possibility in order to avoid a misdiagnosis.","title":"Gemcitabine-associated CD8+ CD30+ pseudolymphoma.","pubmedId":"11703296"}
