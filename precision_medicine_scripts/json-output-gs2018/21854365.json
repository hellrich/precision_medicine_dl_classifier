Population. A total of 95 premenopausal women having LAVH from January 2009 to December 2009.\nComparison of 47 premenopausal women who had single port LAVH using trans-umbilical GelPort access (SP-LAVH group) and 48 premenopausal women who had conventional multiport LAVH (conventional LAVH group).\nEvaluation of sexual function was done prior to and six months after surgery using a validated tool, the female sexual function index (FSFI).\nIn terms of women\u0027s demographic characteristics and operative results, there was no significant difference between the two study groups, or between pre- and postoperative individual domain scores or total female sexual function index in women who underwent either conventional or single port LAVH.\nNeither conventional nor single port LAVH affects sexual function in premenopausal women. Women can be counseled that this type of surgery is unlikely to alter sexual function.","title":"Does conventional or single port laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy affect female sexual function?","pubmedId":"21854365"}
