Extensive genomic profiling of tumor samples, particularly of defined subsets of patients (pts) who achieved extreme responses to targeted drugs (outlier pts) may help identifying sensitivity or resistance biomarkers. The aim of the INT-MSKCC collaborative study was to delineate the molecular landscape of outlier pts enrolled in a phase 2 trial of PZP (NCT01031875).  Methods:    We analyzed formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue from a patient (#1) achieving a 32-m lasting PR to PZP in the third-line metastatic setting. Moreover one 3-m lasting PR (#2, in 4th line) and one primary refractory case (pt #3) were analyzed.  Tumor and matching germline DNA was sequenced using the Integrated Molecular Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets. Briefly, exon capture of 341 cancer related genes was followed by deep coverage next-generation sequencing to identify somatic variants, small indels and copy number alterations.  Results:    In responding pts we found a significant EGFR copy number amplification (pt #1, fold change \u003d 17, CNA) and an ERBB2 S310F mutation (pt #2), a hotspot and frequent driver mutation in UC.  Pt #1 contained the most alterations (74 events). MTOR and ERBB2 mutations occurred at different sites in pt #1,2 and ERBB3 in #1. Patient #1 had alterations in chromatin-regulating genes reported at high frequency in TCGA bladder including KMT2D and EP300 frameshift, CREBBP truncation, and KMT2C point mutations, and pt #2 had ARID1A frameshift and KMT2 point mutations.  The resistant case (pt #3) showed deletions of CDKN2B and CDKN2A, and mutations in PIK3CA (1 H1047R), FGFR3 (S249C), KDM6A, and STAG2.  Conclusions:    Present genomic analyses revealed EGFR amplification, MTOR and ERBB2 mutations in a patient with outstanding response to PZP. This association deserves validation in a wider PZP treated cohort of pts.  Alterations on multiple potential therapeutic targets further characterized responding and resistant cases. These data might be useful for the design of combinatorial and/or sequential therapies directed against these targets.","title":"Molecular signature of patients with pre-treated urothelial carcinoma (UC) achieving extreme responses to pazopanib (PZP) salvage therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_151378-156"}
