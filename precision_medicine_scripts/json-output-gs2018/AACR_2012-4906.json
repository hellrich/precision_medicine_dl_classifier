Materials and Methods: BGC823 cell was dealt with 10-6M and 10-5M TAM for 24h and 48h. Cell growth was assessed by WST1 assay. The mRNA and protein expressions of ER36 were examined by RT-PCR and Western blot methods. Average optical densities were detected and processed using Student\u0027s t test analysis. Immunofluorescence assay was used to examine ER-36 location in BGC823 cell. Hoechest33258 assay was used to examine apoptosis. Results: TAM could promote apoptosis and inhibit growth of BGC823 cell, and this effect had concentration dependant (P\u003c0.05). TAM could promote ER36 mRNA expression, and the increase level of ER36 mRNA expression had concentration dependent of E2(P\u003c0.05). TAM could promote ER36 protein expression, and the increase level of ER36 protein expression had concentration dependent of E2(P\u003c0.05). The location of ER36 had no change, when BGC823 cell dealt with TAM.Conclusions: TAM could promote apoptosis and inhibit growth of BGC823 cell, and the effect had concentration dependant. TAM could promote ER36 expression in BGC823 cell, and the effect had concentration dependant.
