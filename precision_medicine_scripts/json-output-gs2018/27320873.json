When categorizing negative and weakly positive cases into negative group and the positive and strongly positive cases into positive group, the total negative and positive expression rates of p16INK4a were 16.67% (22/132) and 83.33% (110/132) in the carcinoma tissues. Statistical analysis showed the expression intensity of p16INK4a differed significantly between the age groups (P\u003c0.05) but was not significantly correlated with ER, PR, Her-2, molecular subtypes or metastasis of the tumors.\nThe compensatory high expression of p16INK4a is the main mechanism of cell cycle deregulation in invasive breast cancer and can be an important specific molecular marker for invasive breast cancer.","title":"[p16INK4a protein is a specific molecular biomarker of breast cancer].","pubmedId":"27320873"}
