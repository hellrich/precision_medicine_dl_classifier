Eight different monoclonal antibodies, that can recognize tumor-associated antigens of dermal melanomas, were tested in cryostat sections of uveal melanomas. The uveal melanomas showed antigenic differences (e.g., gangliosides) and common antigens (e.g. high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen) in comparison to dermal melanomas. The implications of these results for diagnosing and even treating uveal melanomas are discussed.","title":"[Tumor markers in malignant choroid melanoma].","pubmedId":"2696716"}
