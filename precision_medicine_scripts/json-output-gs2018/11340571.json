Very few data have so far been published on the cytogenetic abnormalities in HD. We have previously used the analysis of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), employing sorted H\u0026RS cells. The most commonly observed genetic aberrations were a loss on 16q11/21, a gain on 1p13 and a gain on 7q35/36. To confirm the loss of 16q, we analyzed the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using the regions D16S3075 (16p13), D16S3068 (16q11), D16S3136 (16q12), D16S503 (16q13), D16S515 (16q21), D16S3091 (16q23) and D16S520 (16q24). A total of 100 sorted H\u0026RS cells were compared with a similar number of sorted reactive T cells in 15 cases with HD, including 5 cases with nodular sclerosis (NS) type and 10 cases with mixed cellularity (MC) type. LOHs of 16q, especially 16q21-23, were frequently detected, but 16p deletions were infrequent. Analysis of 16q21 showed LOH in 12 of 15 cases with HD (80%), including 9 cases with MC type (90%) and 3 cases with NS type (60%). 16q23 showed LOH in 9 of 15 cases with HD (60%), including 5 cases with MC type (50%) and 4 cases with NS (80%). On the other hand, 16p13 showed LOH in 3 of 15 cases with HD (20%). Immunohistochemical staining showed that H\u0026RS cells rarely expressed E-cadherin, which is located on 16q. Our findings suggest that 16q deletion, especially 16q21-23, is probably involved in H\u0026RS giant cell formation and tumorigenesis.","title":"Chromosome 16q deletion and loss of E-cadherin expression in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells.","pubmedId":"11340571"}
