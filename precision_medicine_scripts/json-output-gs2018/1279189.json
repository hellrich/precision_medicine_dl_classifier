All three neurotrophin receptor mRNAs are expressed in both C6 cells and in type I astrocytic cultures. p75NGFR mRNA levels are increased by either cycloheximide or nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment of C6 cells as measured using RT-PCR. Type I astrocyte cultures also expressed p75NGFR mRNA and NGF treatment increased p75NGFR mRNA levels in these cultures. TrkB mRNA levels were increased by cycloheximide treatment of type I astrocyte cultures but not by NGF treatment. Using RT-PCR, trkA mRNA was detected in astrocytic cultures as well as in the rat C6 and PC-12 cell lines. We conclude that cultures of type I astrocytes express active NGF receptors and that glia can elicit a response to NGF as seen by an increase in p75NGFR mRNA levels following exposure to NGF.","title":"Expression of p75NGFR TrkA, and TrkB mRNA in rat C6 glioma and type I astrocyte cultures.","pubmedId":"1279189"}
