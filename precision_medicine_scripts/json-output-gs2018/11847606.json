Paraffin-embedded sections from 42 cases with lung carcinoma were stained immunohistochemically using the Avidin-Biotin Horseradish Peroxidase method to search for c-erbB-2 reaction. Results were evaluated semiquantitatively. The c-erbB-2 expression from each case was compared according to tumor type, grade, mitotic activity, clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. Results were statistically analyzed by using chi-square tests. We were unable to detect a significant relation between c-erbB-2 expression and histological grade, nodal metastasis, number of mitotic figures or tumor type, but we did observe a statistically significant correlation between clinical stage and increased c-erbB-2 expression (p \u003c 0.05). In our opinion, c-erbB-2 expression in human lung carcinomas may be useful for determining clinical outcome.","title":"Prognostic factors and c-erbB-2 expression in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (c-erbB-2 in non-small cell lung carcinoma).","pubmedId":"11847606"}
