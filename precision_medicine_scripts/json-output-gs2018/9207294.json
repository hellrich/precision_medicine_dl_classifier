Most mutations occur in the 5\u0027 half of the gene, and mutations toward the 3\u0027 end are rare. The aim of this study was to document the phenotypes in a family with a truncating mutation at codons 1982-1983, one of the most 3\u0027 mutations on record. Colonic polyps in this family were much less numerous, and their growth was delayed compared with the classical FAP picture, and malignant degeneration occurred considerably later. Two individuals had sparse colonic but profuse gastric fundic gland polyposis. Gardner\u0027s syndrome stigmata were variable, and a desmoid tumor was recorded in 1 person.","title":"The clinical correlates of a 3\u0027 truncating mutation (codons 1982-1983) in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene.","pubmedId":"9207294"}
