We developed a PD-L1 IHC assay to investigate whether it could predict response to pembro in NSCLC patients (pts) and be used as a companion diagnostic.  Methods:  The assay uses the 22C3 antiPD-L1 murine monoclonal antibody on the Dako platform. One pathologist scored each tumor sample by 4 methods: percentage of cells staining at any intensity (PS1), percentage of cells staining at moderate/strong intensity (PS2), percentage of cells staining at strong intensity (PS3), and H-score (HS \u003d PS1 + PS2 + PS3). Only cells with at least partial membrane staining were counted. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to compare scoring methods and determine a cutoff using data from 146 NSCLC pts treated with pembro in KEYNOTE-001 who had tumor evaluable for PD-L1 expression by IHC and data for response (immune-related response criteria, investigator review). Samples from the first 31 pts were also tested with a prototype assay by a different pathologist who scored the presence or absence of a regional, primarily inflammatory cell or interface pattern in addition to the above. PFS and OS were assessed in the 146 pts with measurable disease (RECIST 1.1, central review).  Results:  The various scoring methods are summarized in the table. Incorporating the interface pattern did not improve scoring. Using PS1, 19 (43%) of 44 pts with  50% tumor cell staining responded, versus only 8 (8%) of 102 pts with \u003c 50% tumor cell staining (odds ratio \u003d 8.93). Median PFS and OS were 4.0 mo and not yet reached, respectively, for pts with  50% staining and 2.1 and 6.1 mo, respectively, for pts with \u003c 50% cell staining.  Conclusions:  The PD-L1 IHC assay is potentially useful to enrich trial populations and as a companion diagnostic in NSCLC. While all 4 scoring methods assessed performed similarly, the percentage of cells staining at any intensity with a cutoff of 50% is the simplest and easiest method to implement in practice.
