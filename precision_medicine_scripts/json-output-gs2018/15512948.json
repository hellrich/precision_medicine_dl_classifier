Immunoanalysis was done by a semi quantitative method. The tumors were divided into 3 groups. Group A: Tumors with no extrascleral extension/no liver metastases, group B: tumors with only extrascleral extension and group C: tumors with liver metastases. For statistical analysis we analyzed the negative, weak (heterogeneous) and the positive expression of HLA and beta 2 microglobulin with known clinicopathological parameters.\nIn-group A (n \u003d 35) tumors with no extrascleral extension and no liver metastases HLA class I antigen and beta 2 microglobulin are negative (absent staining) in 30 choroidal melanomas. In-group B (n \u003d 4) they are weak (heterogeneous) in 3 tumors. In-group C (n \u003d 6) all the 6 tumors have a positive (bright staining) immunoexpression. No statistical significance was obtained when HLA and beta 2 microglobulin immunoreactivity was compared against largest tumor diameter (LTD), tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), mitosis and nuclear grade. The difference of HLA class I and beta 2-microglobulin imunoreactivity among the various cell types spindle, mixed and epithelioid was statistically significant (p \u003d 0.003), (p \u003d 0.004). The difference in immunoreactivity between tumors with no liver metastases and tumors with liver metastases was statistically significant (p \u003c 0.001).\nHLA class I antigen and beta 2 microglobulin are negative in melanomas with no extrascleral extension and liver metastases and weak in melanomas with extrascleral extension and are positive in melanomas with liver metastases. HLA expression is independent of the conventional markers in uveal melanoma.","title":"HLA expression in choroidal melanomas: correlation with clinicopathological features.","pubmedId":"15512948"}
