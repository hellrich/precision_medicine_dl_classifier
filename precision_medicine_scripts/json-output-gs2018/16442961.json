Hormone receptor status and Her-2/neu expression of primary and metastatic tumors were correlated with overall survival.\nAt a mean follow-up of 39 months after hepatic resection, median survival was 32 months. Patients undergoing anatomic resection with or without ablation lived significantly longer than those undergoing more limited resections (46 vs. 25 months, P \u003d .016). Survival was significantly greater in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive primary (P \u003d .02) and metastatic (P \u003c .004) tumors, Her-2/neu-positive metastases (P \u003d .02), \u003c/\u003d2 hepatic metastases (P \u003c .002), and age \u003e50 years at metastasectomy (P \u003d .02).\nThe ER status of the primary tumor and ER and Her-2/neu status of hepatic metastases, in addition to other clinical factors, may help select patients who would benefit from hepatic metastasectomy.","title":"The utility of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her-2/neu status to predict survival in patients undergoing hepatic resection for breast cancer metastases.","pubmedId":"16442961"}
