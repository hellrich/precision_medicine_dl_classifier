TMK-1 gastric cancer cells were injected into the gastric wall of nude mice to generate tumours. After 4 days, mice were randomly assigned to the following groups: control, DC101 ([vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-receptor (R)-2 antibody], C225 (EGF-R antibody), or a combination of DC101 and C225. The combination therapy significantly inhibited gastric tumour growth compared with the control group, whereas the decrease in tumour growth in mice treated with DC101 or C225 alone did not reach statistical significance. All mice administered DC101 demonstrated decreased tumour vascularity and increased endothelial cell apoptosis. C225 alone did not affect angiogenesis, but inhibited tumour cell proliferation. The combination therapy led to a further decrease in tumour cell proliferation. The combination of anti-VEGF-R and anti-EGF-R therapies was effective in inhibiting gastric cancer growth. These findings support the hypothesis that inhibiting multiple biological pathways that mediate tumour growth may be an effective therapeutic strategy.","title":"Effects of combination anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapies on the growth of gastric cancer in a nude mouse model.","pubmedId":"12008203"}
