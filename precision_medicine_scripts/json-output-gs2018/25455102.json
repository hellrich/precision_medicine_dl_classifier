Primary GBM patients carrying IDH1 mutations were significantly younger, mean age of 41±5.06years, than patients with wild-type IDH1, mean age of 57±2,29years, p\u003d0.011. The mean survival time of all GBM patients with and without IDH1 mutations was 19months (5 cases) and 16months (35 cases), respectively (p\u003e0,05). MGMT methylation was detected in 13 of the 40 patients (32,5%). MGMT-promoter methylation did not correlate with overall survival (OS; p\u003e0,05).\nIn summary, our study is the first study to investigate the IDH1 mutation status and MGMT methylation in primary GBMs in Turkish population and confirmed IDH1 mutation as a genetic marker for also primary GBMs. Our data are still insufficient for definite ascertainment; and our preliminary results suggest: IDH1 status shows an association with younger age and there is a lack of association between IDH1 mutation and survival time. Furthermore MGMT promoter methylation had no prognostic value and lower frequency in primary glioblastomas.","title":"IDH1 mutations is prognostic marker for primary glioblastoma multiforme but MGMT hypermethylation is not prognostic for primary glioblastoma multiforme.","pubmedId":"25455102"}
