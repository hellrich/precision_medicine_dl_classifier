Stimulated CT is generally better than basal, but in the lower ranges false negatives and false positives still occur. In families with hereditary MTC, RET gene mutation analysis has superseded measurement of plasma CT in the detection of asymptomatic disease gene carriers. All individuals with apparently sporadic MTC, but in whom there is some suspicion of familial disease, should also have RET genetic analysis. A negative DNA result practically excludes the possibility of hereditary MTC in families where an index case has been investigated and obviates the need for further biochemical evaluation. Disease gene carriers may be divided into three distinct risk groups depending on the specific RET gene mutation in the family. The age at which presymptomatic surgery has to be performed depends on the risk group to which the patient belongs. Compared with the results of DNA analysis, the results of CT stimulation tests have become less important in the assessment of timing of surgery. During follow-up of patients who underwent surgery, measurement of plasma basal CT is still useful. The high sensitivity of measuring stimulated CT levels does not outweigh the burden of life-long periodic stimulation tests and the limited clinical consequences of slightly elevated levels. Stimulation tests are inevitable for persons at risk who prefer not to have genetic testing.","title":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma: role of genetic testing and calcitonin measurement.","pubmedId":"11392493"}
