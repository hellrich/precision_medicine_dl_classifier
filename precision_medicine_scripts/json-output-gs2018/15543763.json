The methylation specific PCR (MSP) test was used to analyze promoter methylation status for genes CDKN2A (p16), hMLH1, APC, CDH1 (Cadherin E) and FHIT.\nWe found methylation in at least one of the genes studied in 88% of cases and in 3 or more genes in 40.5% of cases. The frequencies of promoter hypermethylation of CDKN2A, hMLH1, APC, CDH1 and FHT were 41.4%, 11.4%, 52.9%, 70% and 42.9%, respectively. We found a relationship between CDKN2A methylatlon and better survival (p\u003d0.002). CDH1 methylation and poor histological differentiation (p\u003d0.007), hMLH1 methylation and non-Mapuche ethnicity (p\u003d-0.03), APC methylation and larger tumor size (p\u003c0.05), FHIT methylatton and lack of estrogen rectptor IHC expression (p\u003c0.05).\nThe high frequency of promoter methylation in patients with breast cancer confirms its role in breast carcinogenesis. The finding of alterations in the methylation pattern of genes studied and its association with prognostic factors is a helpful tool in the search of new criteria for clinical and therapeutic decision making.","title":"[Promoter methylation profile in breast cancer].","pubmedId":"15543763"}
