The effects of gossypol on three melanoma cell lines were further examined by immunoblotting analysis, cell cycle analysis, flow cytometric apoptotic assay and autophagy assay. The functional role of autophagy in gossypol-induced growth inhibition was investigated using siRNA-mediated knockdown of Beclin-1.\nGossypol retained its efficacy in BRAF-V600E melanoma clones with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors through a mechanism independent of MEK-ERK inhibition. Gossypol caused G2/M arrest in both BRAF mutant A375P and A375P/Mdr cells with high expression of p21(Cip1), regardless of their drug resistance. Interestingly, we determined that the lack of gossypol-induced mitotic arrest in BRAF-WT-harboring SK-MEL-2 cells was associated with a low level of p21(Cip1) expression. In addition, gossypol preferentially induced autophagy and apoptosis in the gossypol-sensitive cells and not in the gossypol-resistant SK-MEL-2 cells. In particular, alleviation of autophagy by knockdown of Beclin-1 partially caused a resistance to gossypol-induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M in BRAF-V600E cells with a concomitant decreased induction of apoptosis.\nTaken together, these results suggest that gossypol may exhibit potential for the treatment of BRAF inhibitor-resistant tumors, but a functional p21(Cip1) is a prerequisite for a positive response to its clinical application.","title":"BH3-mimetic gossypol-induced autophagic cell death in mutant BRAF melanoma cells with high expression of p21Cip¹.).","pubmedId":"24625733"}
