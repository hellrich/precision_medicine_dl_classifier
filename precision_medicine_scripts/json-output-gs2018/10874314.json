The nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), which is caused by mutations of PTCH gene on chromosome 9q22, accounts for about 2% of all medulloblastomas. Previous studies of PTCH in sporadic medulloblastomas using single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) detected mutations in about 10% of the tumors. In this study, we directly sequenced the PTCH gene in 20 sporadic medulloblastoma DNA samples. A nonsense mutation (Q694X) and a splice site alteration (2875+1G\u003eA) were identified in two of the samples. The mutations are predicted to result in a truncated PTCH protein and aberrant splicing, respectively. In both cases, only the mutant alleles were identified, indicating that the mutations were associated with loss of the wild-type PTCH allele in the tumor cells. Several novel variants, including 1653T\u003eC, 1672C\u003eT, and 2292C\u003eT, were also found in these tumor samples. One of the two mutations detected in this study had been missed by SSCP, suggesting that the true rate of PTCH mutations in sporadic medulloblastomas may be underestimated by SSCP screening. Nevertheless, the frequency of mutations in this study did not differ from previous reports.","title":"Identification of PATCHED mutations in medulloblastomas by direct sequencing.","pubmedId":"10874314"}
