The blood serum concentration of corticosterone was elevated in these animals. Blood serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine showed an initial increase after lung instillation of hexavalent chromium followed by a decline. Metabolism of testosterone by the alveolar macrophages to 17 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstane-3-one and 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol was reduced 6 and 12 h after the K2Cr2O7 instillation, which was also associated with damage of lung cell function and decreased uptake by the alveolar macrophages of Candida albicans particles. As early as 12 h after s.c. administration of 400 micrograms dexamethasone/100 g body wt, increased levels of lung surfactant could be measured. At this time the lungs showed no signs of cellular damage, and metabolism of testosterone as well as uptake of Candida albicans particles by the alveolar macrophages were normal. Lower s.c. doses of dexamethasone did not result in raising the levels of lung surfactant in 12 h. Within 12 h after s.c. administration of large doses of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone no measurable effects on the levels of lung surfactant could be measured. Since animals treated with dexamethasone (200 micrograms/100 g body wt) or long-acting synthetic ACTH (100 micrograms i.m. Synacthen Depot/100 g body wt) for 5 days after lung instillation of K2Cr2O7 had extremely high levels of lung surfactant, it is concluded that the corticosteroids in adult rats may help to create augmented surfactant levels following lung intoxication. This could proceed via stimulation of surfactant production and reduction of surfactant removal. Different aspects of lung surfactant metabolism are discussed.","title":"Corticosteroids and lung surfactant levels in adult male rats.","pubmedId":"2826897"}
