We herein describe the case of a 15-year-old Japanese boy with inv(16) harboring a low-allelic burden internal tandem duplication of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) and KIT mutations. Conventional chemotherapy eradicated a clone with a low-allelic burden FLT3-ITD mutation, although another clone with a KIT mutation occurred 17 months later. Further investigation is necessary to identify AML with inv(16) conferring poor prognosis, to facilitate appropriate treatment with additional drugs, such as dasatinib or gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
