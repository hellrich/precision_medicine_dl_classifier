Ponatinib, as the third generation BCR-ABL TKIs, has the potential activity against CML with T315I mutant BCR-ABL whereas high frequency of serious adverse events limits its clinical use. Through a compound library screen, we identified a novel compound PBA2, a dual kinases inhibitor of GSK3 and BCR-ABL, as a promising agent for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML. Not only can PBA2 inhibit cell growth but also induce terminal cell differentiation in a series of kinase mutant CML cell lines as well as T315I mutation. Remarkably, the mechanism of action of this compound involved the simultaneous inhibition effect of BCR-ABL and GSK3, which could be a fruitful approach to suppress the -catenin/CBP signal pathway that promoted the interaction of -catenin/p300, leading to growth inhibition and subsequent terminal differentiation. More importantly, we found a novel molecular link between CBP and BCR-ABL. We showed that CBP could regulate BCR-ABL expression through activating CREB which binds to the BCR-ABL promoter in CML cells to start transcription, and the BCR-ABL in turns affect the expression level of CBP. This positive feedback pathway between CBP and BCR-ABL represents a novel way for the treatment of CML, and the novel compound PBA2 targeting at this loop deserves further investigation in clinical trial.","title":"PBA2, a dual BCR-ABL and GSK3kinases inhibitor, represses a wide array of Imatinib resistant cell lines in chronic myeloid leukemia","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3915"}
