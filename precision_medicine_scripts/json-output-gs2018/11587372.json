Thus the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase is an ideal target for pharmacologic inhibition. ST1571 (formerly CGP57148B), is an Abl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor that in preclinical studies selectively kills Bcr-Abl-containing cells in vitro and in vivo. The results of clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of molecularly targeted therapies, and ST1571 is emerging as a new therapeutic agent for CML.","title":"ST1571, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia: validating the promise of molecularly targeted therapy.","pubmedId":"11587372"}
