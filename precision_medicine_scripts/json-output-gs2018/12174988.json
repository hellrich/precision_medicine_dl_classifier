Gynecomastia remains a controversial factor, this term being used for both a histologic reality and a physical finding. Advanced disease is characterized by pain, bloody discharge and skin ulceration. There is no definitive diagnostic algorithm. Experience with male breast mammography is limited, and imaging is less informative for patients under 50 years of age. Fine-needle aspiration tends to overestimate the rate of malignancy. The commonest histologic finding is infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma. Treatment includes modified radical mastectomy, followed by cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouracil-Adriamycin-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy for disease of stage II or greater. Radiotherapy does not seem to add any benefit. The disease is highly receptor-positive; however, many patients discontinue tamoxifen due to side effects. The most important prognostic factors are tumour size, lymphatic invasion and axillary node status.\nBecause of the low incidence of male breast cancer, advances will be obtained mainly with the rapid transfer of newly gained knowledge in female mammary neoplasia. The increased use of adjuvant chemotherapy combined with tamoxifen postoperatively may have a positive impact on survival. Public education should be oriented toward men at higher risk to reduce the interval between appearance of symptoms and consultation. Rigorous data collection will allow for thorough reporting of risk factors and thus the possibility of characterizing the etiology of this disease.","title":"Male breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"12174988"}
