We reviewed retrospectively 208 cases of adult leukemia in which SL and/or UL were obtained. Elevated lysozyme levels were not found in any of the M0, M3, or M7 cases, but were increased (false positive) in three (14%) M1 cases, 18 (19%) M2 cases and one (20%) M6 case. Although a UL value in excess of 3x normal was found in most cases of AML M4 and M5, only five (11%) M4 cases and three (20%) M5 cases had SL elevations of this magnitude. Lysozyme levels need to be interpreted in conjunction with other parameters for FAB classification.","title":"Usefulness and limitations of serum and urine lysozyme levels in the classification of acute myeloid leukemia: an analysis of 208 cases.","pubmedId":"8709618"}
