A conservative operation was performed because the precise nature of the tumor was not clear with light microscopy. An ultrastructural study established the final diagnosis of malignant urethral melanoma and anterior exenteration was performed. An aggressive operation should be considered as the primary approach once malignant melanoma is diagnosed. Ultrastructural studies should be introduced early in the diagnostic process when light microscopy is insufficient to provide a definitive diagnosis of urethral malignancy.","title":"Melanoma of the female urethra.","pubmedId":"7288952"}
