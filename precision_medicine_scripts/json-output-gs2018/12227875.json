Nine tumors (five sBCCs and four nBCCs), all ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 1 cm, were treated. Treatment consisted for sBCCs of three weekly applications and for nBCCs of five weekly applications for 8 weeks. Histological examination was performed at the beginning and at the end of the study. For small tumors, similar-appearing lesions were removed for baseline histological confirmation. Follow-up was performed at 1-week intervals in order to carefully detect any change.\nThree sBCCs cleared clinically after 4 weeks of treatment and two nBCCs after 8 weeks. The remaining four lesions showed excellent clinical responses with evident (\u003e50%) size reduction at 6 weeks, but no further improvement. Histological examination with multiple-step sections confirmed complete clearing for those lesions showing clinical resolution, except for one nBCC that showed scant tumor remnants. Local adverse effects (itching, erythema and bleeding) were mild and did not prompt discontinuation of treatment. No systemic side effects were noted.\nImiquimod 5% cream is an effective therapeutic option for both sBCC and nBCC in patients with basal cell nevus syndrome. The treatment was very well received by all patients engaged in the study, who stated their appreciation for a topical treatment rather than multiple surgical excisions. A higher number of applications and longer treatment periods are required for nBCCs.","title":"Topical imiquimod treatment of superficial and nodular basal cell carcinomas in patients affected by basal cell nevus syndrome: a preliminary report.","pubmedId":"12227875"}
