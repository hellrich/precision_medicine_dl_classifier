In addition, an expression of integrin subunits for FN and VN was analyzed by flow cytometry. All glioma cells tested migrated to both FN and VN to a various degree. Glioma cells which strongly migrated to FN or VN showed an intense expression of alpha 5 or alpha v, respectively, while there was no correlation between cell adhesiveness to FN or VN and intensity of the integrin expression. Studies using primary tumor cells from surgical specimen revealed that only an intensity of cell adhesiveness to FN was negatively correlated well with the degree of clinical invasion of gliomas. That is, the more glioma cells adhered to FN, the less the original tumor tissues showed tumor invasion.","title":"[Migration and adhesiveness of malignant glioma cells to fibronectin or vitronectin and their expression of integrin subunits].","pubmedId":"7543163"}
