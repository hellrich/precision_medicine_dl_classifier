Researches have demonstrated that hepatic intra-arterial bio-chemotherapy can improve the treatment efficacy of metastatic melanoma. This study was to investigate hepatic intra-arterial bio-chemotherapy for the treatment and survival of patients with liver metastasis from melanoma.\nTwenty-one patients with liver metastasis from melanoma were treated with hepatic intra-arterial infusion of dacarbazine (250 mg/m(2)) from the first to the fifth day, and fotemustine (100 mg/m(2)) at the sixth and fourteenth day, followed by adoptive transfer of autologous cytokine-induced killer cells and administration of interleukin-2 and 150 ug granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor for 10-12 days. The treatment was repeated every 28 days. The overall survival, response and toxicity were analyzed.\nSeventeen of twenty-one patients were evaluable. One achieved complete remission (CR), one achieved partial remission (PR), six had stable disease (SD) and nine had progression disease (PD).The disease control rate was 47.06% (8/17), with a median progression free survival (PFS) of 3.76 months and a medium overall survival (OS) of 6 months. Treatment related complications were mainly myelosuppression (grade III-IV), occurring in 38.1% (8/21) patients.\nHepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy can improve the disease control rate of progressive melanoma. It tends to prolong the PFS and OS with tolerable toxicity in patients with liver metastasis from melanoma.","title":"[Hepatic intra-arterial bio-chemotherapy for the treatment of melanoma patients with liver metastasis: a phase II clinical study].","pubmedId":"18710619"}
