The second group included 51 (85%) tumors and was lacking p53 expression. p53 protein overexpression was significantly associated with extraocular extension and vascular invasion (p values, 0.01 and 0.04). No significant correlation was found between p53 protein expression and the clinicopathologic features of these lesions.\np53 protein overexpression occurs in the uveal melanoma and may be associated with some unfavorable histological features (invasion).","title":"The relationships between p53 protein expression and the clinicopathological features in the uveal melanomas.","pubmedId":"15662123"}
