Screening upper gastrointestinal endoscopy examination revealed a superficial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) at the middle thoracic esophagus and Barrett\u0027s epithelium and a superficial adenocarcinoma at the abdominal esophagus. We performed a subtotal esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction via the retrosternal route. Pathological examination revealed a Barrett\u0027s adenocarcinoma at the abdominal esophagus. Esophageal cancer is thought to be a multicentric disease, and we sometimes find multiple esophageal cancers. In Japan, most cases of multiple esophageal cancers are composed of SCCs, and the occurrence of multiple esophageal cancers composed of SCC and Barrett\u0027s adenocarcinoma is rare. In contrast, the number of the patients with Barrett\u0027s esophagus is increasing, and the number of the patients with Barrett\u0027s adenocarcinoma also seems to be on the rise. Therefore, it is important be aware of the possibility of multiple esophageal cancers composed of SCC and Barrett\u0027s adenocarcinoma while making diagnoses.","title":"[A Case of Synchronous Multiple Esophageal Cancers Composed of Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Barrett\u0027s Adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"26805207"}
