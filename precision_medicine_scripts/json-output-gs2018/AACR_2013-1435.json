Here we found that deletion of the gene encoding TGF receptor 2 (Tgfbr2) specifically in myeloid cells reduced the level of platelet factor-4 (PF4) in the myeloid cells of 4T1 tumor bearing mice. This is accompanied by decreased lung metastasis of 4T1 mammary carcinoma. Interestingly, deletion of Cxcr3, encoding the receptor for PF4, significantly decreased the lung metastasis of 4T1 mammary carcinoma. The decreased metastasis may attribute to augmented anti-immunity. First, myeloid cells with Cxcr3 deletion showed decreased expression of IL-10, IL-4, iNOs, and arginase. In addition, there was an increased number of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell in Cxcr3-/- mice compared to the wilt type controls. Our results suggest that TGF regulation of PF4 may modulate cancer metastasis through suppressing host anti-tumor immunity.","title":"Myeloid TGF- signaling regulates Platelet factor 4 expression that is important in host immune suppression and tumor metastasis.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-1435"}
