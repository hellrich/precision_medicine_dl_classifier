Recently, a variety of studies have shown that melatonin induces apoptosis in various cancer cell types such as colon cancer, Ewing sarcoma, hepatic cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer cells. Glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells (GCSLC) are the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. In the present study, we found that melatonin significantly decreased the sphere formation of GCSLC, and attenuated the expression of c-Myc genes. Furthermore, melatonin suppressed expression of H3K4me3 and H3K79me3 around c-Myc promoter region by Western blotting and Chip assay. Of note, melatonin suppressed the expression of several stemness markers including nestin in GCSLC. Overall, our findings suggest melatonin as a potent anticancer stem cell agent for GCSLC.","title":"Melatonin inhibits stemness of glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells via regulation of histone methylation","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-94"}
