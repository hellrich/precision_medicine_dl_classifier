Thirty-one UCAN from 15 UC patients who had undergone colorectal resection at our institution were investigated. There were 8 lesions of invasive carcinoma, 15 high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and 8 low-grade dysplasia (LGD). DNA was extracted from each neoplastic lesion and corresponding non-neoplastic tissue by a microdissection method. MSI status at 9 microsatellite loci, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the APC locus, and K-ras codon 12 point mutation were examined. As for MSI, 4/31 (13%) UCAN (carcinoma: 1/8 (13%), HGD: 2/15 (13%), LGD: 1/8 (13%)) were MSI-high (3 or more unstable loci) and 12/31 (39%) UCAN (carcinoma: 3/8 (38%), HGD: 6/15 (40%), LGD: 3/8 (38%)) were MSI-low (1 or 2 unstable loci). LOH at the APC locus was not found in 9 UCAN from 6 informative (heterozygous) cases. The K-ras mutation rate of UCAN was 3/31 (9.7%) (carcinoma: 2/8 (25%), HGD: 1/15 (7%) and LGD: 0/8). MSI is relatively common in UCAN and is present at the early stage of tumorigenesis of UCAN, while the involvement of genetic alterations of the APC gene and K-ras gene is small. MSI may be one of the mechanisms of the increased neoplastic risk in UC, and UCAN may develop through a different carcinogenic pathway from sporadic carcinomas.","title":"Genetic alterations in ulcerative colitis-associated neoplasia focusing on APC, K-ras gene and microsatellite instability.","pubmedId":"10595736"}
