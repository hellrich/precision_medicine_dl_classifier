Tissue sampling is the historical platform for genomic biomarker assessment, but non-invasive ctDNA assay provides an alternative when tissue is unavailable or cannot be safely obtained. Methods: Hybrid-capture based genomic profiling using a ctDNA assay (FoundationACT) was performed on blood samples from 82 consecutive pts with lower alimentary canal CA. Results: Median age was 62 (range 28-92) and 61% were male. Anatomic breakdown included CRC (n \u003d 51), esophageal (n \u003d 9), gastric (n \u003d 8), gastroesophageal (n \u003d 3) and small bowel adenoCA (SBA, n \u003d 2), anus squamous cell CA (n \u003d 5), and other GI CA (n \u003d 4). At least one GA was reported in 72% of cases. In 23 cases with no GA reported, the average maximum somatic allele frequency was 0.17% (95% CI: 0-0.6%) vs. 16.7% (95% CI: 0-54.4%) for the 59 cases with GAs (P \u003c 0.0001). For the 3 of 18 patients with both blood and tissue testing performed and samples collected within a 30-day interval, 8/9 (89%) GA detected in tissue were also detected in ctDNA. An average of 1.7 GA/sample were detected in ctDNA. The most commonly altered genes were TP53 (61%), KRAS (24%), BRAF (10%) and PIK3CA (10%). Comparative analysis using the tissue-based Foundation Core database showed a similar trend with overall slightly higher frequencies of GAs in individual genes. RAF and RAS short variants (SV) were exclusive to lower GI and anal CA. KRAS and RAF1 amplification (amp) occurred only in esophageal CA (4/11, 36%). FGFR SV or amp was identified in 3 cases across the cohort. Of CRC, 4 (8%) had  1 ERBB2 activating SV or amp, 2 (4%) had IDH1/2 hotspot SV, and 2 (4%) had BRCA2 inactivating alterations. ERBB2 activating SV and EGFR amp were found in a SBA and an esophagus CA, respectively. A kinase fusion was identified as the sole driver in 1 CRC (STRN-ALK) and 1 SBA (GOPC-ROS1). Outcomes to targeted therapies will be presented for the available subset of patients. Conclusions: Our results provide early clinical support and confirm that hybrid-capture based ctDNA testing can reliably detect all 4 classes of GA and provide a molecular profiling option for patients with GI CA.","title":"Genomic profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients (pts) with advanced cancers of the GI tract and anus.","pubmedId":"ASCO_177110-195"}
