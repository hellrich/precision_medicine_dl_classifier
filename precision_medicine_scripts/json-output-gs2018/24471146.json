Severe cases may result in complete glenohumeral ankylosis, with resultant upper extremity motion through the scapulothoracic joint, and significant functional consequences. We report the case of a 72-year-old male with spontaneous glenohumeral ankylosis who suffered a humeral shaft fracture with resultant painless nonunion. Motion through the nonunion site caused significant subjective functional improvements, increased range of motion, and the ability to complete his activities of daily living. Patients with limited shoulder range of motion may be at higher risk for humeral fractures and nonunion. These patients, however, may experience improved function due to increased upper extremity range of motion through the nonunion site.
