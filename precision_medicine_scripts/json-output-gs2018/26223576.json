Mutations in the PTEN gene at 10q23.3 are restricted to less than half of the 10q-deleted gliomas, suggesting additional glioma-associated tumor suppressors on 10q. We investigated 64 astrocytic gliomas of different malignancy grades for aberrant expression of 16 microRNAs (miRNAs) on 10q. Thereby, we identified four miRNAs (miR-107, miR-146b-5p, miR-346, miR-1287-5p) whose expression was frequently down-regulated in anaplastic astrocytomas and/or glioblastomas. DNA methylation analyses revealed 5\u0027-CpG site hypermethylation of miR-346 in more than two-thirds of primary glioblastomas, while aberrant 5\u0027-CpG site methylation of miR-146b-5p was frequent in IDH1-mutant astrocytomas and secondary glioblastomas. Overexpression of either of the four miRNAs in glioma cell lines reduced cell proliferation and/or increased caspase-3/7 activity. Expression analyses of miRNA overexpressing glioma cells and 3\u0027-untranslated region luciferase reporter gene assays revealed evidence that these miRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate expression of glioma-relevant genes, including CDK6 (miR-107), EGFR (miR-146b-5p, miR-1287-5p), TERT and SEMA6A (miR-346), all of which are overexpressed in malignant gliomas in situ. In summary, we show that the 10q-located miRNAs miR-107, miR-146b-5p, miR-346 and miR-1287-5p are frequently down-regulated in malignant gliomas and thereby may support overexpression of important glioma growth-promoting genes.
