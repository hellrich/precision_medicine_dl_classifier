OBJECTIVE/DESIGN OF THE STUDY: Because frequencies of RET SNPs have not yet been evaluated in patients with elevated serum concentrations of calcitonin (hCt), a biochemical marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), we studied RET SNPs in patients with FMTC (n \u003d 22), patients with sporadic MTC (n \u003d 45), and 71 subjects presenting with moderately elevated hCt concentrations (basal, \u003e10 pg/ml; pentagastrin stimulated, \u003e 50 \u003c 100 pg/ml) in comparison with an age- and gender-matched control group (n \u003d 79) with basal hCt concentrations in the normal range (\u003c5 pg/ml).\nAfter DNA extraction from citrated whole blood, RET exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 and exon/intron boundaries were analyzed by PCR-based cycle sequencing for RET germ line mutations, exonic (G691S, L769L, S836S, S904S) and intronic (IVS13+158; NCBI rs2472737 \u003d IVS14-24) SNPs.\nIn FMTC patients, the F791Y mutation was found to be associated (P \u003d 0.001) with the L769L SNP. The exonic SNPs (G691S, L769L, S836S, and S904S) were not different among the four groups. The intron 14 SNP (IVS14-24), however, was more frequent in individuals with elevated hCt serum concentrations (P \u003d 0.016) and patients with sporadic MTC (P \u003c 0.001) when compared with the control group.\nThese data suggest that the exon 13 (L769L) and the intron 14 (IVS14-24) SNPs could act as genetic modifiers in the development of some forms of hereditary and sporadic MTC, respectively.","title":"Polymorphisms in exon 13 and intron 14 of the RET protooncogene: genetic modifiers of medullary thyroid carcinoma?","pubmedId":"16118333"}
