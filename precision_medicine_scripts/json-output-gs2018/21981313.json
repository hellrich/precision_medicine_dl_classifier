The lesions were divided into three groups: benign naevi (BN), dysplastic naevi (DN) and MM. The NNT ratio was calculated as (BN + DN + MM)/MM.\nIn total, 4691 lesions were examined. The overall mean NNT was 6.3, with a range of 4.9-11.3 for each of nine consultant dermatologists. The mean NNT was 7.6 for female and 4.8 for male patients. There were more patients with BN (n \u003d 3534; 75%) than with DN (n \u003d 407; 9%) or MM (n \u003d 750; 16%). The gender representation was similar in the DN and MM groups, but had a disproportionately female bias in the BN group (67% female, 33% male patients). Overall, there were more female patients in all three groups [2962 female patients (63%) and 1729 male patients (37%)].\nThe NNT of 6.3 in this study compares favourably with NNT ratios from studies of dermatologists from other countries. This study may encourage other countries and individual doctors to assess their NNT ratios, as it may be an important indicator of the efficient use of resources and the avoidance of unnecessary surgery for patients.","title":"The number of benign moles excised for each malignant melanoma: the number needed to treat.","pubmedId":"21981313"}
