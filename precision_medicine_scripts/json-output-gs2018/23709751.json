The developments of immune checkpoint modulation via cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade, with ipilimumab, and targeting of BRAF(V600), with vemurafenib or dabrafenib, as well as MEK, with trametinib, have been paradigm changing both for melanoma clinical practice and for oncology therapeutic development. These advancements, however, reveal new clinical questions regarding combinations and optimal sequencing of these agents in patients with BRAF mutant disease. We review the development of these agents, putative biomarkers, and resistance mechanisms relevant to their use, and possibilities for sequencing and combining these agents.
