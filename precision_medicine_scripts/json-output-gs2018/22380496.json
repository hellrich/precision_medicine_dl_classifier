The observation of a poor clinical course of the case may contribute to explanation of the action of t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation, of which poor prognostic action is known on ALL\u0027s, in terms of ABL1 gene, independent of the BCR gene. On the other hand, the prognostic significance of this variant ABL1 translocation detection, which is very rarely observed, will cast a light on future cases (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref. 11).","title":"The variant translocation of ABL1 gene t(2;9)(q21;q34) in a childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","pubmedId":"22380496"}
