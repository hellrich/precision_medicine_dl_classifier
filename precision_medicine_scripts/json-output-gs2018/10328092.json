We report a case arising in the kidney of a 20-year-old man which was difficult to distinguish from Wilms\u0027 tumor. The tumor metastasized to the liver and lungs, and the patient died of disseminated disease 5 years after his initial presentation. Both the primary and metastatic tumors were composed predominantly of spindle cells with occasional more epithelioid areas that were inconsistently arranged in nests. In both primary and metastatic sites, the tumor surrounded and entrapped normal epithelial elements, mimicking the biphasic appearance of Wilms\u0027 tumor. The tumor cells, however, were positive for S-100 protein and HMB45 and negative for keratin and CD99, and cytogenetic analysis revealed a clonal abnormality, translocation t(12;22)(q13;q12), characteristic of CCSSP. This result was verified by fluorescence in situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded tissue, which demonstrated EWS gene-region rearrangement. CCSSP joins a growing list of tumors that typically arise in soft tissue (PNET, solitary fibrous tumor, and infantile/congenital fibrosarcoma), but can also present in the kidney and may be confused with primary renal tumors. Awareness of this possibility and the use of ancillary studies. including immunohistochemistry, cytogenetic analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, are important for accurate diagnosis.","title":"Clear cell sarcoma of soft parts: report of a case primary in the kidney with cytogenetic confirmation.","pubmedId":"10328092"}
