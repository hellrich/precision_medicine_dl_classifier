The medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is one of the most aggressive forms of thyroid malignancy,accounting for up to 10% of all types of this disease. The mode of inheritance of MTC is autosomal dominantly and gain of function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are well known to contribute to its development. MTC occurs as hereditary (25%) and sporadic (75%) forms. Hereditary MTC has syndromic (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, B; MEN2A, MEN2B) and non-syndromic (Familial MTC, FMTC) types. Over the last two decades, elucidation of the genetic basis of tumorigenesis has provided useful screening tools for affected families. Advances in genetic screening of the RET have enabled early detection of hereditary MTCs and prophylactic thyroidectomy for relatives who may not show any symptom sof the disease. In this review we emphasize the main RET mutations in syndromic and non syndromic forms of MTC, and focus on the importance of RET genetic screening for early diagnosis and management of MTC patients, based on American Thyroid Association guidelines and genotype-phenotype correlation.
