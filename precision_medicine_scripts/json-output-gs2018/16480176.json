We have employed a novel restriction digestion based multiplex PCR assay to analyse the methylation status of promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes (p16, hMLH1, MGMT and E-cadherin) in sporadic breast carcinomas of Indian women. The present results indicated the absence of hypermethylation in promoter region of p16 and MGMT genes. However, 6 of the 19 (31.6%) sporadic breast carcinomas showed hypermethylation in the promoters of two of the genes analysed; three in hMLH1 and another three in E-cad. Since our earlier studies have shown lack of genetic alterations such as missense mutations and deletions in the tumor associated genes-p16, ras and p14ARF in sporadic breast tumors, the epigenetic alterations of the two genes reported in the present study could be of interest and might be among the events in the genesis/progression of sporadic breast carcinomas.","title":"Methylation of E-cadherin and hMLH1 genes in Indian sporadic breast carcinomas.","pubmedId":"16480176"}
