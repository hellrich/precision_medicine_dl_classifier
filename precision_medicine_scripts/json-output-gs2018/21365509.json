The expression of Rb and CDK6 protein within these tissues was examined using immunohistochemistry.\nThe overall methylation rate of gastric cancer tissues was 73.3%, which was significantly higher than that in the adjacent tissues(10.0%, P\u003c0.05). The overall positive rates of Rb and CDK6 protein in gastric cancer tissues were 86.7% and 80.0%, respectively. DNA methylation of hsa-miR-124a was positively correlated with the expression of Rb and CDK6 proteins. Significant associations were found between hypermethylation of hsa-miR-124a and tumor size, differentiation, lymphatic metastasis, and invasion depth(P\u003c0.01).\nHypermethylation of hsa-miR-124a is present in gastric cancer, and is associated with increased expression of CDK6 and Rb protein. These may be related to the proliferation and development of malignancy in the stomach.","title":"[Role of miR-124a methylation in patients with gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"21365509"}
