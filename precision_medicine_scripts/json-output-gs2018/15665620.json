Patients treated in the earlier era were to have received a hybrid bolus and a 12-hour continuous infusion of interleukin (IL)-2 (total, 48 MIU), while in the latter era 4 days of interferon- alpha preceded the TIL and IL-2; which was given by a hybrid schedule that included bolus and 72- hour continuous IL-2 (total, 96 MIU). There were 55 patients, including 23 patients with melanoma, 9 patients with renal cell carcinoma, and 8 patients with colorectal cancer. There was only 1 objective tumor response, which was noted in a patient with renal cell carcinoma. The 55 patients who received these products were grouped in cohorts by treatment era, quantity of TIL received, amount of IL-2 intended, and different combinations of TIL and IL-2.\nThere was no difference in survival by production method (treatment era), or amount of IL-2 given with TIL, but 33 patients who received an intermediate or higher dose of TIL (mean \u003d 54.4 x 10(9)) had a median survival of 11.8 months, compared to 6.4 months for 22 patients who received 1 low-dose TIL (mean \u003d 6.48 x 10(9)) (p \u003d 0.059, log rank test). The objective response rate in this heterogeneous group of patients was not encouraging. The data suggest there may be a dose/benefit relationship between the total number of TIL infused and survival.","title":"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interleukin-2: dose and schedules of administration in the treatment of metastatic cancer.","pubmedId":"15665620"}
