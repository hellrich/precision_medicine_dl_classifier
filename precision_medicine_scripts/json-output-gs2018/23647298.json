Since 2004, when activating mutations of the EGFR were firstly identified, several genetic aberrations have been discovered, mainly in adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutations are a relatively frequent event in non-small-cell lung cancer, generally consisting of exon 19 deletion or exon 21 substitution. In adenocarcinoma, additional rare mutations are detectable in the EGFR gene, as well as in other genes, including ALK, ROS1, RET, HER2 and BRAF. Recent studies in squamous cell carcinoma identified TP53 as the most frequent mutation, followed by additional more rare mutations, including PI3KCA, PTEN, DDR2 and FGFR. The aim of the present review is to analyze the potential prognostic and predictive role of rare mutations.","title":"Rare mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23647298"}
