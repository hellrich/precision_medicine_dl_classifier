The relationship between EGFR mutation status and clinicopathological factors, tumor markers, prognostic was analyzed.\nThe mutation and the wild group had 169 and 214 patients respectively. EGFR mutation in female, non-smoking, adenocarcinoma and less than 60 years old accounted for 63.91%, 61.54%, 88.76% and 62.13% with statistical significance compared with male (χ(2) \u003d 53.490, P \u003d 0.000), smoking (χ(2) \u003d 48.568, P \u003d 0.000), non-adenocarcinoma (χ(2) \u003d 105.560, P \u003d 0.000) and more than 60 years old (χ(2) \u003d 6.057, P \u003d 0.017). Disease free survival (DFS) of the wild group was better than mutation group (χ(2) \u003d 11.329, P \u003d 0.001). In addition, there were some relations between mutation status and excision repair cross complementing (ERCC1) protein, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and Cyfra21-1. ERCC1(+) (χ(2) \u003d 6.739, P \u003d 0.012), SCC(χ(2) \u003d 16.839, P \u003d 0.000) and Cyfra21-1(χ(2) \u003d 6.638, P \u003d 0.013) more than normal value was common in wild group. Increased CEA was common in mutation group (χ(2) \u003d 5.436, P \u003d 0.023).\nEGFR mutation is commonly found in female, non-smoking, adenocarcinoma and less than 60 years old NSCLC patients. The wild group obtains better DFS than mutation group. Tumor markers may predict the mutation status, which need further research.","title":"[Epithelial growth factor receptor mutation status to the effective of survival in non-small cell lung cancer after surgery].","pubmedId":"23336484"}
