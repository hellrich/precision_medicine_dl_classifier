Eligible studies that investigated the association between survival in EAC and the expression status of EGFR were identified by an electronic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science. A meta-analysis was performed to clarify the impact of EGFR overexpression on clinicopathological parameters or overall survival (OS) in EAC. A total of seven studies including 1028 patients were subjected to the final analysis. The overall results suggested that overexpression of EGFR was significantly correlated with not only the depth of invasion, lymph node status, and tumors stage of EAC, with a pooled odds ratio of 2.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-8.35; Z \u003d 2.09; P \u003d 0.037), 3.05 (95% CI: 1.77-5.27; Z \u003d 4.00; P \u003c 0.001), and 5.37 (95% CI: 2.49-11.57; Z \u003d 4.29; P \u003c 0.001), respectively, but also the poorer OS with a pooled hazard ratio of 2.20 (95% CI: 1.47-3.31; Z \u003d 3.79; P \u003c 0.001). Overexpression of EGFR correlates with not only the clinicopathological features, but also the worse OS, and it might be useful as a predictive biomarker in clinical practice, yet the clinicopathological and prognostic role of EGFR in EAC still needs further confirmation by well-designed prospective studies.
