Basic information on comparative geographical, epidemiological, and clinical research was collected.\nIn early 1970s, cancer registry system in Cixian was established, collecting information on all the esophageal cancer cases in Cixian. Data was checked manually, then computerized, coded and analyzed using the software--SPSS 11.5.\nFrom 1974 to 2002, there were 18 471 esophageal cancer cases in Cixian, with 11 068 males and 7403 females, respectively. The age standardized incidence rate (ASR) for males was 208.77 per 100,000, while 120.47 per 100,000 for females. The trend of incidence rate of esophageal cancer had decreased during the 29 years from 1974 to 2002 (trend chi(2) \u003d 19.94, P \u003c 0.001). From 25 years of age onward, the incidence rates of the lower age groups declined with the increase of age. As for geographic distribution, the incidence rate in mountainous areas and hilly areas showed a significant declining trend in mountainous areas, chi(2) \u003d 195.00, P \u003c 0.001; hilly areas, chi(2) \u003d 46.08, P \u003c 0.001. The esophageal cancer incidence in plain areas remained steady, but had a slight increase in recent years. From 1969 to 2002, there were 18,736 cases died of esophageal cancer with 11 598 males and 7138 females. The ASR for male was 127.17 per 100,000 and 101.57 per 100,000 for female. Compared with the year 1969, the mortality rate of esophageal cancer in 2002 had a 37.96% decline. The proportion of esophageal cancer among malignant tumors in different decades decreased significantly.\nThe trend of the incidence rate of esophageal cancer had been decreasing for the last 29 years. The incidence rate in mountainous areas and hilly areas showed a declining trend while in the plain areas it remained steady but having slight increase in the recent years. The mortality rate of esophageal cancer had a significant decrease from 1969 to 2002.","title":"[Study on the esophageal cancer incidence and mortality rate from 1974-2002 in Cixian, China].","pubmedId":"16749993"}
