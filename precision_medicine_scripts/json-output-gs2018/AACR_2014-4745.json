Promising clinical responses have been observed in patients bearing tumors with ROS1 fusions treated with Xalkori, an ALK/MET kinase inhibitor that also inhibits Ros1. However, resistance has been observed and a ROS1 kinase domain mutation, G2032R, was identified in a ROS1 fusion positive NSCLC patient who developed resistance to Xalkori treatment. Clinical experience with other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors suggests that additional resistance mutations are likely to arise, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents that can overcome this type of resistance.We identified a novel chemical series of potent and selective Ros1 inhibitors with a unique DFG-out binding mode. The structure of human Ros1 in a complex with a ligand from this chemical class was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Here we describe the structure-activity relationships and synthesis route for this chemical series. A representative compound from this series inhibited isolated recombinant Ros1 kinase activity with an IC50 of approximately 30 nM. This compound inhibited less than 6% of kinases in a panel of 400 at 1 M concentration. Growth of Ba/F3 cells engineered to express Ros1 autophosphorylation in HCC78 NSCLC cells that harbor a SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion were inhibited at similar concentrations as the isolated protein. This activity translated into potent Ba/F3-Ros1 tumor growth inhibition in mice. This compound was also active on Ba/F3 cells containing Ros1 with a mutation in the gatekeeper residue, L2026M, in cell growth assays in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, this unique binding mode provides scope for activity on additional Ros1 mutations that confer resistance to Xalkori, such as the clinically relevant G2032R mutation. The results shown here describe a novel chemical series with a unique binding mode that has potential for activity in Ros1 driven tumors with mutations that confer resistance to Xalkori.","title":"Discovery of potent and selective Ros1 inhibitors with a unique DFG-out binding mode","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4745"}
