The lesion rapidly enlarged over 2 weeks into an inflammatory 5 cm fleshy nodule that was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and was found to overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A fatal outcome occurred 3 months after the initial diagnosis of cancer, in spite of chemotherapy and treatment with EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab). Cutaneous metastases occur in 10 percent of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Contiguous cutaneous metastases in the head and neck areas are by far the most common. Conversely, isolated infradiaphragmatic cutaneous metastases are exceedingly rare and are associated with an aggressive clinical course. In a patient with cancer, the possibility of distant skin metastasis should be considered whenever new cutaneous nodules appear.","title":"Skin metastasis of head and neck carcinoma predictive for dismal outcome.","pubmedId":"18713589"}
