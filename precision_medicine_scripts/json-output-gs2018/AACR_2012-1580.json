As tumor contains many dying cells releasing self DNA, we investigated whether intra-tumoral injection of LL-37 induces anti-tumor immunity through pDC activation. Mice bearing established subcutaneous B16-OVA melanoma were injected intratumorally with LL-37. LL-37 was found to induce IFN- expression in treated tumors. Furthermore, LL-37 induced an activation and expansion of OVA-antigen-specific CD8 T cells in draining lymph nodes as well as the tumor micro environment. This process was associated with delay in tumor growth. These findings suggest that LL-37 could induce anti-tumor immunity and provide a promising strategy for melanoma immunotherapy.","title":"LL-37-mediates tumor antigen-specific-T cell expansion and tumor regression","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1580"}
