The reaction offers means for identifying cellular immune response to melanoma antigens in uveal melanoma patients. It may be useful in the diagnosis of malignant melanoma of the eye.","title":"[Reaction of leukocyte migration inhibition in patients with uveal melanoblastoma].","pubmedId":"3705529"}
