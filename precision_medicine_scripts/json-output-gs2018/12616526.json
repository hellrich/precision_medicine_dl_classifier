We have previously reported that NT treatment of murine and human brain-metastatic melanoma cells affects their invasive capacities and increases the production of extracellular-matrix degradative enzymes. These cells express aberrant levels of functional p75(NTR) and TrkC, the putative high-affinity receptor for the neurotrophin NT-3. Here we demonstrate that, by using sensitive immune-complex kinase assays in human brain-metastatic (70W) melanoma cells, TrkC receptors associate with a kinase activity exhibiting a dose-dependent susceptibility to inhibition by the purine-analogs 6-thioguanine and 2-aminopurine. The activity of this purine-analog-sensitive kinase (PASK) was induced by NT-3 in a time-dependent fashion, phosphorylating exogenous myelin basic protein (MBP) but not denatured enolase. It is similar to the one reported to relate with p75(NTR) and TrkA receptors and stimulated by the prototypic NT, nerve growth factor. Thus, PASKs may represent unique signaling components common to NT receptors that could engage joint downstream signaling effectors in brain-metastatic melanoma.","title":"Human melanoma TrkC: its association with a purine-analog-sensitive kinase activity.","pubmedId":"12616526"}
