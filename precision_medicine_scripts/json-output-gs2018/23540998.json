We analyzed the prognostic impact of these mutations and their interactions in adults with CN-AML. NPM1 mutation (NPM1mut) and FLT3-ITD mutation (FLT3-ITD+) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and GeneScan assays of bone marrow samples obtained from newly diagnosed 104 CN-AML patients. FLT3-ITD+ and NPM1mut were detected in 36 (34.6%) and 30 (28.8%) out of 104 subjects, respectively, 16 cases (15.4%) had double NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+. The incidence of FLT3-ITD+ was significantly higher in the NPM1mut group than in the NPM1 wild (NPM1wt) group (P \u003d 0.018). Statistical analysis revealed that isolated NPM1mut group had a better clinical outcomes in terms of higher complete response (CR) rate (P \u003d 0.01) and a trend towards favorable overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P \u003d 0.28, 0.40, respectively). In contrast, the isolated FLT3-ITD+ group had an unfavorable outcome in terms of lower CR rate (P \u003d 0.12), shorter OS, and DFS (P \u003c 0.0001 for both). The NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD-group had the best OS and DFS, while the NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD+ group had the worst OS and DFS than other groups (NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+ or NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD-) (P \u003c 0.0001 for both). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age and FLT3/ITD+ were independent poor prognostic factors for OS (P \u003d 0.006, \u003c0.0001, respectively), while FLT3/ITD+ was independent predictor for DFS (P \u003d 0.04). However, NPM1mut did not have a significant impact on OS and DFS. In conclusion, adult patients with CN-AML carrying isolated NPM1mut and isolated FLT3-ITD+ exhibit different clinical outcomes than those with NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+ or NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD-. Patients with NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD- had the best prognosis in terms of higher CR, OS, and DFS, while those with NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+ had the worst CR rate, and NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD+ had the lowest OS and DFS.","title":"Prognostic implications of NPM1 mutations and FLT3 internal tandem duplications in Egyptian patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"23540998"}
