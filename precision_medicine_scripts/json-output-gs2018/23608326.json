The immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of EGFR in 78 cases of gastric cancer and 20 cases of adjacent normal tissue. The relationship between the high expression of EGFR and clinicopathological features was analyzed.\nEGFR positive expression rate in the 78 cases of gastric cancer tissue was 57.7 % (45/78), while EGFR was not expressed in 20 cases of adjacent normal tissue. The high EGFR expression was positively correlated with the position of gastric cancer, tumor size, cell differentiation, invasive depth, lymph node metastasis and TNM staging, yet having no obvious relation with gender or age.\nEGFR expression level in gastric cancer is closely related to the incidence and development of gastric cancer, which can provide a theoretical basis for the targeted therapy for gastric cancer with EGFR as the target.","title":"Relationship between expression of EGFR in gastric cancer tissue and clinicopathological features.","pubmedId":"23608326"}
