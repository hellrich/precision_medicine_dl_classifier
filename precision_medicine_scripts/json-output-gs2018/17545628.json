Thyroid cancer is an example of a tumor with nonoverlapping genetic mutations that up-regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Here, we show that FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1), which is expressed mainly in neoplastic thyroid cells, propagates MAPK activation and promotes tumor progression. In contrast, FGFR2 is down-regulated in neoplastic thyroid cells through DNA promoter methylation. Reexpression of FGFR2 competes with FGFR1 for the immediate substrate FGFR substrate 2 to impede signaling upstream of the BRAF/MAPK pathway. These data unmask an epigenetically controlled FGFR2 signal that imposes precisely on the intragenically modified BRAF/MAPK pathway to modulate thyroid cancer behavior.","title":"Epigenetically controlled fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signaling imposes on the RAS/BRAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to modulate thyroid cancer progression.","pubmedId":"17545628"}
