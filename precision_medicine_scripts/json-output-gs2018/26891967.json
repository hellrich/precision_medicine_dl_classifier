This intravenous drug is approved in the EU and USA as combination therapy with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-2 and isotretinoin for the postconsolidation treatment of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. In a multinational, phase III study in this patient population, event-free survival (EFS) benefits with the dinutuximab-containing regimen versus isotretinoin alone were observed at the time of the primary (p \u003d 0.0115) and confirmatory (p \u003d 0.0330) efficacy analyses, although the observed p-value for the between-group difference in EFS for the primary efficacy analysis did not cross the prespecified boundary for statistical significance (p \u003c 0.0108). Significant and sustained (5 years) overall survival benefits were seen with the dinutuximab-containing regimen versus isotretinoin alone. Despite pretreatment with analgesics, antihistamines and antipyretics, serious adverse reactions have been reported with the dinutuximab-containing regimen, with infusion reactions and neuropathy prompting the US FDA to issue boxed warnings. Dinutuximab administered in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2 and isotretinoin represents an important advance in the postconsolidation treatment of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, with its benefits outweighing its risks in a patient population with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options.
