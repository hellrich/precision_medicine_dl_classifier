Molecular techniques identified the presence of the rare e19a2 BCR-ABL1 transcript. The patient was treated by 1(st) generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) (imatinib). Disease monitoring was performed by cytogenetic analyses and quantification of the BCR-ABL1 transcript. After 3 months, the treatment was modified due to an absence of biological response and poor tolerance. After 21 months with 2nd generation TKIs (nilotinib), the patient was responding optimally to treatment, with a complete cytogenetic response and a major molecular response. This observation emphasizes the importance of determining the chromosomal breakpoints at diagnosis to enable adequate molecular monitoring of residual disease. Careful monitoring of minimal residual disease is important to thoroughly assess the response to treatment, detect resistance and adapt the therapeutic strategy. The kinetics and the depth of the response to TKI also represent major prognostic factors. Molecular monitoring is performed using real-time quantitative PCR, which has to be adapted to each type of transcript. For rare BCR-ABL1 transcripts, an international standardization, as it is developed for conventional transcripts, is lacking. Yet, such a harmonization would be useful to assess in an optimal and large scale way the response to TKI in these patients, and to determine what the best management is.
