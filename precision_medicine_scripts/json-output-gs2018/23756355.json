Thirty-nine patients were women. Fifty-five patients underwent operations for the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) at the mean age of 38 years (4-82 years). The mean follow-up duration was 89 months. TNM staging was as follows: T0NxMx in 19, TxNxMx in 1, T1NxMx in 22, T1N1Mx in 8, T2N1Mx in 1 and T3N1Mx in four patients. In the T1/x-Nx group, 96% were considered cured after surgery. In the N1 group (n\u003d13), six patients had multifocal disease and five patients were cured. Age and gender were not significant predictors of remission. Twenty-two patients did not undergo an operation (age 1.5-78 years); among them, 11 patients had a mean basal calcitonin (CT) level of 9.8 pg/ml (2-24) after 53 months of follow-up. One patient had been operated on for phaeochromocytoma (PHEO), and their CT level remained normal for 262 months.\nThis study confirms that RET 790 mutation is associated with a non-aggressive form of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, as 28% of the patients were followed up without thyroidectomy, 25% had been thyroidectomised with no tumour being detected and even patients with MTC had slow-evolving disease. Moreover, only one patient had PHEO, and no-one had primary hyperparathyroidism.","title":"The clinical spectrum of RET proto-oncogene mutations in codon 790.","pubmedId":"23756355"}
