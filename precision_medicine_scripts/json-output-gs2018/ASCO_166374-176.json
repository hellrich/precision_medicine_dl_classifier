Prevalence of mutations and survival by carrier status among PDAC patients has not been well described. Methods: Using a hereditary cancer panel, we sequenced 25 cancer susceptibility genes in lymphocyte DNA from 303 well-characterized PDAC patients (47% female, mean age (+SD) 64.9+10.3 years, 98% White, 3% Ashkenazi Jewish heritage) in the Mayo Clinic Familial Pancreatic Cancer Registry. Kindreds that contained at least two first degree relatives (FDR) with PDAC met criteria for Familial Pancreatic Cancer (FPC), while the remaining were familial, but not FPC. Results: Overall, 35 of 303 (12%) patients carried a deleterious mutation in one of 10 genes in the 25-gene panel. Of the 186 FPC patients, 24 (13%) were carriers, and 11/117 (9%) patients with family history not meeting FPC criteria were carriers. Prevalence of (n) in PDAC patients were BRCA2 (11), ATM (8), CDKN2A (4), CHEK2 (4), MUTYH/MYH (3 heterozygotes, not biallelic), BRCA1 (2), and 1 each in BARD1, NBN,PALB2, and PMS2. Novel mutations were found in ATM, BARD1, and PMS2. Among individuals with deleterious mutations in genes associated with breast cancer, 13/27 (48%) had a FDR with breast cancer vs non-carriers (76/276 (28%); p \u003d .02); among only women with these deleterious mutations, the proportions were 9/12 (75%) and 39/129 (30%), respectively; p \u003d .003). There was no significant difference in median survival overall or by stage among mutation carriers versus non-carriers: Overall sample: 14.2 months (mos) vs 12.7 mos, respectively; p \u003d 0.78; Resectable: 32.4 mos, n \u003d 10 vs 27.3 mos, n \u003d 78; Locally Advanced: 14.5 mos, n \u003d 6 vs 10.6 mos, n \u003d 72; Metastatic: 8.8 mos, n \u003d 15 vs 7.8 mos, n \u003d 98). Conclusions: With 12% prevalence of deleterious mutations, susceptibility gene testing in PDAC patients with a positive family history is warranted regardless of meeting FPC criteria. These findings will inform genetic risk counseling for family members. While survival did not differ, further analysis is warranted. The diversity of genetic susceptibility offers future opportunities for targeted therapies.","title":"Genetic heterogeneity and survival among pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with positive family history.","pubmedId":"ASCO_166374-176"}
