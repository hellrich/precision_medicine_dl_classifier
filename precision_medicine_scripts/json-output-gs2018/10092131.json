In this study we investigated 46 nonfunctional pituitary tumors and 21 somatotrophinomas for aberrant methylation of the CpG island contained within the CDKN2A gene as an alternative mechanism of gene silencing. We demonstrate methylation in 32/46 (70%) of nonfunctioning tumors, in contrast to 2/21 (9.5%) somatotrophinomas and 0/15 histologically normal postmortem pituitaries. Methylation in noninvasive and invasive nonfunctional tumors was approximately equal at 15/20 (75%) and 17/26 (65%), respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis showed an absence of CDKN2A protein in 25/32 (78%) methylated nonfunctioning tumors, demonstrating a highly significant overall correlation (P \u003d 0.00007) between hypermethylation of the gene and absence of the p 16 protein. The association between hypermethylation and absence of CDKN2A protein remained when the cohort of nonfunctional tumors was further subdivided into noninvasive 12/15 (80%; P \u003d 0.004) and invasive 13/17 (76%; P \u003d 0.01), suggesting this to be an early event in pituitary tumorigenesis. In contrast, a single invasive methylated somatotrophinoma failed to express the CDKN2A protein. These data show that hypermethylation of the CpG island within exon 1, but not exon 2, of the CDKN2A gene is frequently associated with loss of protein expression in nonfunctional pituitary tumors, but not somatotrophinomas, suggesting different tumorigenic pathways.","title":"Hypermethylation of the p16/CDKN2A/MTSI gene and loss of protein expression is associated with nonfunctional pituitary adenomas but not somatotrophinomas.","pubmedId":"10092131"}
