These cancers have a very poor prognosis, due to the delay in diagnosis. Vulvar location is about 1% of melanomas then the vaginal location, uterine and ovarian. There is no consensus to date regarding their care, due to the rarity of the lesions. Their treatment must however be based on the current data concerning gynaecological cancers as well as standard management of cutaneous melanoma. The treatment is often based on conservative surgery, because radical resection does not improve survival. For the vulva and vagina, reconstructive surgery is possible. Treatment is sometimes supplemented by chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which could improve local control. The interest in the use of targeted therapy in these locations is not well known because of their rarity, but the study of genes c-Kit and BRAF provides new prospects for treatment. The objective of this review is to describe and report the current state of knowledge about gynaecologic melanomas.
