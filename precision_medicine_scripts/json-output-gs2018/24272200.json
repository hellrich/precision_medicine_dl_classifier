However, its biological role and clinical significance in cholangiocarcinoma development and progression are unknown. In this study, immunohistochemistry was conducted to investigate the expression of decorin in cholangiocarcinomas. The results showed that decorin levels markedly decreased in 44 cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared to 40 adjacent normal tissues. The analysis between decorin expression and clinicopathological characteristics in cholangiocarcinoma patients showed that patients with low levels of decorin expression had a relatively poor prognosis. Moreover, recombinant human decorin treatment and overexpression of decorin in cholangiocarcinoma cells could inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and promote apoptosis. Furthermore, the E-cadherin expression significantly increased after decorin overexpression or use of recombinant human decorin in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Our findings indicated that downregulation of decorin may be identified as a poor prognostic biomarker in cholangiocarcinomas. Also, decorin-mediated inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cell growth, migration, and invasion and promotion of cell apoptosis might be through regulation of the expression of E-cadherin in vitro.
