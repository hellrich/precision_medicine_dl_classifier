We explored the roles of Src family tyrosine kinases in cell migration and the spread of K-1735 murine melanoma cell lines with low or high metastatic potential. Corresponding to elevated cell motility and spreading ability, Fyn was selectively activated among Src family kinases, and the cell motility was blocked by an inhibitor of Src family kinases. Significant tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, stable complex formation between activated Fyn and cortactin, and co-localization of cortactin with Fyn at cell membranes were all observed only in cells with high metastatic potential. Both integrin-mediated Fyn activation and hyperphosphorylation of cortactin were observed 2-5 h after stimulation in highly metastatic cells, and they required de novo protein synthesis. We demonstrate that cortactin is a specific substrate and cooperative effector of Fyn in integrin-mediated signaling processes regulating metastatic potential.","title":"Cooperative roles of Fyn and cortactin in cell migration of metastatic murine melanoma.","pubmedId":"13129922"}
