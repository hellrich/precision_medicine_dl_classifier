Its expression and function in brain tumors are, however, not yet known. In this study, we investigated expression of the bisecting GlcNAc structure in a series of pediatric brain tumors and its relationship to tumor response to vinblastine. A plant lectin (E-PHA) that recognizes the bisecting GlcNAc structure was used for detection of this molecule in a total of 90 pediatric brain tumors and normal brain tissue specimens. Our results showed that, whereas E-PHA staining was undetectable in the normal brain tissue, pediatric brain tumor specimens exhibited different levels of reactivity. Lectin staining was particularly prominent in high-grade astrocytomas (73%) and ependymomas (72%). In astrocytomas, there was a positive correlation with the tumor grade, which suggests that the bisecting GlcNAc may be of particular interest as a tumor marker for diagnosis and/or prognosis. By using a human glioma cell culture model, we have found that treatment of these cells with E-PHA lectin enhances their sensitivity to vinblastine. E-PHA interacted directly with the drug transporter P-glycoprotein and inhibited its drug efflux function. In a drug-resistant glioma cell line transfected with the mdr1 gene, drug resistance was reversed by E-PHA. Our findings indicate that: (a) expression of the bisecting GlcNAc in pediatric brain tumors may have a potential relevance as a tumor marker; and (b) glioma response to chemotherapy may be modulated through the bisecting GlcNAc.","title":"Expression of bisecting GlcNAc in pediatric brain tumors and its association with tumor cell response to vinblastine.","pubmedId":"10589784"}
