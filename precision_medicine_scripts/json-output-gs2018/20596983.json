Patients presented clinically with a mass of the outer half of the external auditory canal (n \u003d 14), hearing changes (n \u003d 5), drainage (n \u003d 4), or paralysis of the facial nerve (n \u003d 3). The polypoid masses ranged in size from 0.5 to 3 cm in greatest dimension (mean, 1.8 cm). Histologically, the tumors demonstrated a solid to cystic pattern, composed of an infiltrating glandular to cribriform arrangement of epithelial cells. Histologic features included a dual cell population (although not the dominant histology), increased cellularity, moderate to severe nuclear pleomorphism, irregular nucleoli, increased mitotic figures (mean, 3/10 HPF), including atypical forms, and tumor necrosis (n \u003d 2). Tumors were divided into three types of adenocarcinoma based on pattern of growth and cell type (ceruminous, NOS [n \u003d 12], adenoid cystic [n \u003d 4], mucoepidermoid [n \u003d 1]). CK7 and CD117 highlighted the luminal cells, while S1-00 protein showed a predilection for the basal cells of ceruminous and adenoid cystic carcinomas. Metastatic adenocarcinoma or direct extension from salivary gland neoplasms are the principle differential considerations. Surgical resection was used in all patients with radiation used in four patients. Eleven patients were alive or had died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease (mean, 11.2 years); six patients had died with disease (mean, 4.9 years), all of whom had developed local recurrence.\nCeruminous-type carcinomas, with the exception of ceruminous mucoepidermoid carcinoma, all demonstrated a dual cell population of basal myoepithelial-type cells and luminal apocrine cells. The specific histologic sub-type does not influence the long-term patient outcome.","title":"Ceruminous gland carcinomas: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic study of 17 cases.","pubmedId":"20596983"}
