Reported here is the case of a 68-year-old woman with a high-grade fever uncontrolled by antibiotics or antipyretic drugs, and elevation of the serum LDH and sIL-2R levels. After she was admitted, dyspnea, hypoxia, and severe body weight gain with leg edema gradually developed. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a characteristic migratory local high density area typical of atelectasis. A diagnosis of IVL was made with a transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) and immunohistochemical analysis. The patient was treated with combination chemotherapy (modified CHOP), and her symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, pyrexia and leg edema were quickly resolved. The level of LDH and sIL-2R returned to normal, and a complete response was obtained. Although diagnosis of IVL is difficult, an early and appropriate diagnostic procedure (biopsy of tissue with vessels, such as lung and skin, is required) will improve the prognosis of IVL.","title":"[Intravascular large B cell lymphoma with migratory local high density shadow by chest CT and diagnosed by transbronchial lung biopsy].","pubmedId":"12229127"}
