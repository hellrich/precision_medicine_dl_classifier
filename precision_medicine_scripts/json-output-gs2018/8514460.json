Immunoreactions could be detected in 12 out of 13 cell lines by using the indirect immunofluorescence technique. In 7 of these the majority of cells displayed cytoplasmic staining whereas positive nuclei were detected in only a few cells. Two cell lines had predominantly nuclear reactivity, while the remaining 3 cell lines showed signals in both locations. Despite identical nuclear staining patterns, the 3 MAbs produced qualitatively distinct cytoplasmic immunoreactions. PAb240 and DO-1, which showed similar staining frequencies, appeared more sensitive in the detection of p53 protein than did PAb1801. Immunoprecipitations of lysates from each of the cell lines, with MAbs DO-1 and 1801 (which bind to both wild-type and mutant p53 species) detected 53-kDa proteins, whereas PAb240 (which recognizes the mutant conformation of the protein in this type of assay) detected 53-kDa proteins in only 4 cell lines. Nucleotide sequencing of exons 5 to 9 of TP53 in these latter cell lines showed that each has homozygous point mutations in the locus, whereas in the others no TP53 alterations were found. Three of the 4 mutations were C-to-T transversions, alterations possibly caused by damage from UV-light. Our findings indicate that immunostaining with p53 antibodies, although common in malignant melanoma, results from the presence of mutant p53 protein in about 30% of the cases tested. Neither immunostaining with PAb240 nor the patterns of intracellular distributions of the signals are sufficient to detect TP53 mutations.","title":"Mutation and expression of the p53 gene in malignant melanoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"8514460"}
