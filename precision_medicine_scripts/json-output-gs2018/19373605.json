We previously reported that the activity of the tumor suppressor PTEN is modulated by thioredoxin (Trx) in a RedOx-dependent manner. In this study, we demonstrated that the activity of Trx reductase (TR) is increased by sevenfold in the human prostate cancer cell line, DU-145, after 5 days of sodium selenite (Se) treatment. The treatment of DU-145 cells with increasing concentrations of Se induced an increase in PTEN lipid phosphatase activity by twofold, which correlated with a decrease in phospho-ser(473)-Akt, and an increase in phospho-Ser(370)-PTEN levels. Se also increased casein kinase-2 (CK2) activity; and the use of apigenin, an inhibitor of CK2, revealed that the regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by Se may be achieved via both the Trx-TR system and the RedOx control of the kinase involved in the regulation of PTEN activity.","title":"Sodium selenite increases the activity of the tumor suppressor protein, PTEN, in DU-145 prostate cancer cells.","pubmedId":"19373605"}
