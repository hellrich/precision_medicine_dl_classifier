This lack of change is mostly attributable to a lack of major progress in the understanding and treatment of the disease. The treatment of MBC has been extrapolated from the knowledge of female breast cancer, despite the multiple differences in the pathogenesis, biology and genetics of these two disease entities, especially the differences with regard to the role of male hormones as well as estrogens in MBC compared with female disease. Although major advances in hormonal manipulation for the treatment of breast cancer are being developed, an improved understanding of the potential differences between male and female breast cancer is essential, as this would provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention and probable improved outcome for MBC. This review aims at highlighting the major differences between male and female breast cancer with an emphasis on hormonal therapy, and discusses some of the recent advances in MBC.","title":"Male breast cancer: a gender issue.","pubmedId":"16894388"}
