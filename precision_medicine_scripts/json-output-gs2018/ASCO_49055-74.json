We conducted a phase II study (NCT00881049) to test the KIT inhibitor imatinib in metastatic melanoma pts with KIT aberrations. Methods: Pts with metastatic or unresectable melanoma whose tumor had KIT aberrations (KIT mutation [mut] and/or KIT gene DNA amplification [amp]) and who had measurable disease were enrolled. Pts received imatinib 400 mg/d continually until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The dosage of Imatinib was escalated to 600 mg or 800 mg per day if progression was observed. Response was assessed monthly using RECIST criteria. The endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) and toxicity. Results: Of 390 cases screened, 67 (17.4%) had a KIT mut or amp: 26/137 (18.9%) acral, 21/110 (19.1%) mucosal, 9/26 (34.6%) CSD, 6/75 (8%) NCSD, 5/42 (11.9%) unknown primary. 41 (10.5%) had a mut only; 23 (5.9%) had an amp only; 3 (0.8%) had both. Thus far, 28 patients have been treated with 26 pts currently evaluable: 5 stage M1a/3 M1b/20 M1c; median prior therapies: 2. Six patients (21%) achieved PR (5 mut, 1 amp, 4~10+m); nine patients (35%) received SD ( 3 m, 3.5~9+m). Pts who failed on 400mg also failed on escalation to 600mg and could not tolerate 800mg due to toxicities. Samples of new or progressive lesions were obtained from 5 PR pts after they failed on imatinib 400mg, and were analyzed in KIT, BRAF and PDGFRA. In one pt (emerging metastasis in liver) new mutations were found in BRAF (V600E) and PDGFRA (W559stop) which were wild-type before treatment, and loss of the KIT mutation present at baseline. Common toxicities at 400 mg were rash, vomiting, edema and myelosuppresion. Conclusions: Imatinib (400mg/d) provides a beneficial therapeutic effect for a significant proportion of Chinese metastatic melanoma pts with KIT aberrations. Acquired genetic mutations after treatment may account for emergence of resistance in some pts.
