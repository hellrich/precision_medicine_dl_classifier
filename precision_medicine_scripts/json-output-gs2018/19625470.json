This case represents a very long period between initial diagnosis and distant metastasis with a pathological examination of both the primary and metastatic tumors. Metastatic tumor should be considered for the differential diagnosis of a pulmonary nodule in a patient who has a history of this type of oral tumor.","title":"Solitary pulmonary metastasis of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the palate 43 years after the initial treatment.","pubmedId":"19625470"}
