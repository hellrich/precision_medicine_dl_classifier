IDH1 and IDH2 normally function to convert isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate. However, when these enzymes are mutated at select residues the mutant enzymes now convert -KG into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). In normal cells, 2-HG levels are typically extremely low, but IDH1/2 mutant cells can accumulate up to 10 mM 2-HG. In an effort to counteract the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH enzymes, we identified and developed potent inhibitors of IDH1. The compounds inhibit IDH1 catalytic activity in biochemical assays and reduce 2-HG production in IDH1-mutant cell lines. Consistent with the fact that 2-HG inhibits -KG dependent enzymes including histone demethylases and Tet family hydroxylases, these IDH1 inhibitors induce a decrease in several histone methylation marks and also DNA methylation. These data demonstrate that small molecule inhibitors can reverse many of the epigenetic effects of mutant IDH1.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.","title":"A novel inhibitor of IDH1 abrogates 2-HG production and reverses aberrant epigenetic alterations in IDH1 mutant cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-3514"}
