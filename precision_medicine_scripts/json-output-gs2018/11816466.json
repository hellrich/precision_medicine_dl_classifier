In the surgery the pectoralis muscle was preserved. For adjuvant therapy, 20 mg/day of tamoxifen was orally administered for 5 years. Six years after surgery, relapse was detected in the right major pectoralis muscle. Irradiation at this site and oral administration of 120 mg/day of toremifene citrate were started. The patient had a medical history of diabetes, and the control of her blood sugar was poor. About 2 months after oral administration of toremifene citrate was started, flares with blebs and swelling were observed in the right lower leg, suggesting acute phlebothrombosis of the right lower limb. The symptoms were ameliorated by intravenous administration of heparin and an antibiotic. In administering a high dose of toremifene citrate to patients with complications, careful follow-up is needed.","title":"[A case of locally recurrent breast cancer in which phlebothrombosis of the right leg after hormonal therapy using a high dose of toremifene citrate].","pubmedId":"11816466"}
