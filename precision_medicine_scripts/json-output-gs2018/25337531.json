The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum estrogen and progesterone concentration and their relationship with suicidal attempt ranking in the attempted females.\nThe studied cases chose from patients who had referred to clinical toxicology emergency of Noor Hospital (Isfahan, Iran), during 2012, because of suicidal attempt. The estrogen and progesterone serum level of the 111 females were measured during 24 hours after suicidal attempt. The rank of their suicide, the demographic properties, and the menstrual cycle phase of them were also registered, as the patient\u0027s statement. The results were analyzed by ANCOVA and Kruscal-Wallis under SPSS16.\nMean serum concentration of the estrogen was 76.8 pg/mL, and the mean serum concentration of progesterone was 2.99 ng/mL. Of them, 62.2% were in the luteal phase, and 37.8% were in the follicular phase, as they said. The serum progesterone concentration of the patients with more than two times suicidal attempts was significantly higher than the others.\nThe suicidal attempt ranks significantly related to the serum progesterone concentration and the luteal phase.","title":"Recurrent suicide attempt and female hormones.","pubmedId":"25337531"}
