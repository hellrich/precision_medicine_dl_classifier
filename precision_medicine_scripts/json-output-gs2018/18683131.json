Then the methylation status of the APC gene was analyzed by methylation specific-PCR (MSP) and DNA sequencing. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to screen aberrations involving large fragments from all the 15 exons and promoter region of APC gene.\nNo methylation was present in normal tissues. Hypermethylation was found in tumor tissues of one proband and her son. Loss of heterozygosity was observed in another patient from the same FAP family.\nAberrant methylation of the APC promoter region provides an important mechanism for impairing APC function and may occur early during colon neoplasia progression. Loss of heterozygosity may play a role in patients with classical polyposis.","title":"[Promoter hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity of the APC gene in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis].","pubmedId":"18683131"}
