Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) which has been studied in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for a long time, and it has only recently been applied to SCLC. Therefore we sought to observe firstly the prognostic importance of the FDG uptake in limited disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC) patients and secondly the clinical outcomes and toxicity profiles of LD-SCLC patients treated with conformal radiation therapy (RT) using FDG-PET/CT simulation.\nBetween 2009 and 2011, 33 LD-SCLC patients with LD-SCLC underwent disease staging using FDG-PET/CT conformal RT. Thoracic radiation was administered at a daily fraction of 2 Gy. Total dose was prescribed according to the treatment protocol such as, concurrent or sequential chemotherapy and in some patients according to the response of CT. All patients underwent chemotherapy. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nThe median age of the patients was 58 years (range, 38-77 years). The median follow-up time was 20 months (range, 6.6-47.6 months). The 3-year overall survival (OS) and locoregional control rates were 23% and 48%, respectively.\nThere are few studies examining the impact of PET-CT and the prognostic significance of FDG-uptake on outcomes in patients with LD-SCLC. Higher RT doses in response to higher FDG uptake may be safely applied for the purpose of locoregional control.","title":"PET-CT guided curative conformal radiation therapy in limited stage small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25922706"}
