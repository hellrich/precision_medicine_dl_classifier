Using recently established melanoma severe combined immunodeficiency-human mouse xenotransplantation models, here we further investigate the biological significance of these mutations. We demonstrate that activated N-ras significantly contributes to the chemoresistance of human melanoma both in vitro and in vivo by blocking apoptosis. Overexpression of wild-type N-ras had no such effects. With antisense oligonucleotides and farnesyltransferase inhibitors, tools capable of blocking Ras function on the therapeutic horizon, our observation that activated N-ras is not a bystander but a factor worth targeting to improve therapeutic outcome in melanoma gains additional importance.","title":"Activated N-ras contributes to the chemoresistance of human melanoma in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice by blocking apoptosis.","pubmedId":"9012455"}
