Silencing of BRAF was detected by Western blot and PCR, and cell invasion was observed by the Transwell assay. The nanoparticles significantly downregulated BRAF expression in BGC823 cells (P \u003c 0.01) and inhibited their invasion (P \u003c 0.001). Chitosan nanoparticle-mediated BRAF siRNA interference evidently reduced the invasion capacity of gastric cancers.
