This study describes the preclinical characterization of S49076, a novel, potent inhibitor of MET, AXL/MER, and FGFR1/2/3. S49076 potently blocked cellular phosphorylation of MET, AXL, and FGFRs and inhibited downstream signaling in vitro and in vivo. In cell models, S49076 inhibited the proliferation of MET- and FGFR2-dependent gastric cancer cells, blocked MET-driven migration of lung carcinoma cells, and inhibited colony formation of hepatocarcinoma cells expressing FGFR1/2 and AXL. In tumor xenograft models, a good pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for MET and FGFR2 inhibition following oral administration of S49076 was established and correlated well with impact on tumor growth. MET, AXL, and the FGFRs have all been implicated in resistance to VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors such as bevacizumab. Accordingly, combination of S49076 with bevacizumab in colon carcinoma xenograft models led to near total inhibition of tumor growth. Moreover, S49076 alone caused tumor growth arrest in bevacizumab-resistant tumors. On the basis of these preclinical studies showing a favorable and novel pharmacologic profile of S49076, a phase I study is currently underway in patients with advanced solid tumors.
