It is indicated for the treatment of patients affected by advanced melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation. It has shown successful results in terms of efficacy together with a favorable toxicity profile. Other compounds such as the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the immunotherapeutic agent ipilimumab are also approved in the same group of patients. This article reviews the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical development of vemurafenib. Moreover, its efficacy and toxicity are compared with dabrafenib and ipilimumab. A number of trials with vemurafenib alone or in combination with other drugs are also analyzed. These trials will determine the role of vemurafenib in the treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma in forthcoming years.","title":"Vemurafenib for the treatment of BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"25686114"}
