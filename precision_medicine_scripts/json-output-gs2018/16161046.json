Recently, several clinical therapies targeting EGFR were developed, but the eligibility criteria for these therapies is not fully established. To develop such eligibility criteria for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we sought to clarify: (i) the exact frequency of EGFR overexpression, (ii) the relationship between protein overexpression and gene amplification, (iii) the relationship between gene amplification and specific gene mutations and (iv) the correlation between the status of EGFR and clinical or pathological features. Immunohistochemistry revealed that EGFR protein is overexpressed in 53 (50%) of the 106 ESCC examined. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated clear EGFR gene amplification in 15 of the 53 tumors, somewhat higher EGFR copy in 32 cases, and no increase in 6 cases. Gene amplification was significantly associated with high level overexpression. Direct sequencing of exons 19 and 21 of EGFR revealed no mutations in 15 tumors exhibiting gene amplification, and no mutations in 25 tumors not exhibiting gene amplification. Overexpression of EGFR was significantly correlated with depth of invasion of the tumor. In conclusion, anti-EGFR therapies may be appropriate for patients with ESCC. We assume that combined analyses by immunohistochemistry/FISH would clarify aberrations in protein and gene function, and could help to identify those patients who may benefit from anti-EGFR therapy.","title":"EGFR protein overexpression and gene amplification in squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus.","pubmedId":"16161046"}
