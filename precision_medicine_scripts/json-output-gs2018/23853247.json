To date, the anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) antibody, trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, is the only approved novel agent for these cancers, and its use is limited to the small population of patients whose tumors overexpress HER-2. Despite recent progress in the field, median overall survival remains only 8-12 months for patients with stage IV esophageal or GEJ cancer. In this article, we examine the molecular aberrations thought to drive the development and spread of esophageal cancer and identify promising targets for specific tumor inhibition. Data from clinical studies of targeted agents are reviewed, including epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, HER-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor-directed therapy. Current and future targets include MET, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and immune-based therapies. Evidence from trials to date suggests that molecularly unselected patient cohorts derive minimal benefit from most target-specific agents, suggesting that future collaborative investigation should focus on preselected molecular subgroups of patients with this challenging heterogeneous disease.
