CDKN2A variant were detected using RFLP-PCR and confirmed by genomic sequencing. Clinical and pathological features of CDKN2A-positive cases and CDKN2A-negative cases were compared.\nA148T variant was identified in 157 of 3,069 women with breast cancer (5.1%). Overall, the odds ratio for early-onset breast cancer, given a CDKN2A variant was 1.4 (95% CI 1.075-1.725; P \u003d 0.012). Breast tumors in women with the CDKN2A variant were more commonly intraductal cancers (DCIS) with micro-invasion (14.8% vs. 8.5%; P \u003d 0.035). Carriers and non-carriers were similar with respect to tumor size, laterality, multicentricity, nodal status, family history and estrogen-receptor status.\nThe CDKN2A A148T variant seems to contribute to early-onset breast cancer in Poland. Breast tumors which arise in carriers of A148T variant appear to be similar to those of breast cancers in the population at large.","title":"CDKN2A-positive breast cancers in young women from Poland.","pubmedId":"17061045"}
