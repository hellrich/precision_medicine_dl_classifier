Since cancer is the number one cause of death, it is critical to assess the current and projected cancer burden in this population. Methods: We obtained data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. We included patients who had a previous cancer before age 85, but excluded benign tumors, myeloproliferative, and myelodysplastic neoplasms. Incidence was reported per 100,000 person years and age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population. For current statistics, we included years 2001-2005. Trend analyses were based on 1973-2005 data. Results: The oldest old represents 7.2% of annual new cancers cases diagnosed and 10.5% of cancer deaths in the U.S. The 10 leading cancers by incidence (both sexes and decreasing order) are colorectal (388.9), lung (287.7), breast (250), prostate (211.5), urinary bladder (162.5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (110.9), leukemia (85.1), melanoma (65), renal (46.4), and uterine (40.2). The incidences of melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, renal, and lung cancers are increasing, while those of leukemia, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers are decreasing. The top 5 causes of cancer deaths are lung and bronchus (21%), colorectal (15%), pancreatic (7.1%), prostate (5.9%), and breast cancers (5.3%). Cancer specific survival (CSS) has been increasing continuously since 1973 for melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast, colorectal, prostate, and urinary bladder cancers but decreasing in recent years for colorectal, breast, prostate, and uterine cancers. CSS for leukemia, lung, renal, and uterine cancers showed no change over time. If the current incidence trends for each cancer continue in a linear fashion, it is projected, using 1973-2005 data, that in 2030, the oldest old will represent 8.8% of annual new cancers cases diagnosed and 13.6% of cancer deaths. Conclusions: Cancer incidence and mortality trends in the oldest old differ from the general population. Because the oldest old are likely to have multiple co-morbid conditions, there is a need to find better ways to diagnose and treat cancers in this unique segment of the population.","title":"Cancer in the oldest old population in the United States: Current statistics and projections.","pubmedId":"ASCO_34305-65"}
