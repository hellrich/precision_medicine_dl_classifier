Treatments available for AML largely depend on cytotoxic agents and often the only curative option is an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, an option limited to young persons and associated with high morbidity and mortality. There is an urgent need for the identification of new myeloid targets and an understanding of the key genetic mutations involved in disease progression and prognosis. One such mutation is the internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3) gene which confers an inferior outcome that is attributed to a higher relapse rate. In this review, we evaluate the FLT3-ITD mutation and discuss the recent data regarding emerging approaches using FLT3 inhibitors for the treatment of AML.
