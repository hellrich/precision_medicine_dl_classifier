Thus, ongoing clinical trials with ALK inhibitors are showing promising results. ALK chromosomal alterations in other solid tumors are controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze ALK translocations and gene copy number status in a series of colorectal cancer patients and correlate these findings with tumor pathological features including TNM staging, KRAS and BRAF mutations as well as clinical outcome. Methods: ALK status was retrospectively evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a break-apart ALK probe and centromeric probe of chromosome 2 in biopsies from colorectal cancer primary tumors, as were KRAS and BRAF by mutational analysis. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Immunohistochemistry to assess ALK expression is ongoing. Results: Ninety-eight colorectal cancer patients were evaluated. Normal colon mucosa from 10 patients was used as negative control. Thirty-seven per cent of the patients had an increase in ALK gene copy number (3-5 copies) with the percentage of cells with ALK copy gain within a tumor ranging between 6%-46% (mean 22%). There was no correlation between ALK gene amplification and KRAS mutational status. BRAF mutations were observed in five patients and interestingly all these patients had ALK normal copy number. ALK translocations were not observed. ALK amplification was correlated with nodal status. Forty-three per cent of patients with positive nodal status had an increase in ALK copy number, while only 15% of patients with negative lymph nodes had ALK amplification (p \u003d 0.05). ALK amplification was not correlated with overall survival. Conclusions: The identification of ALK gene amplification in colorectal cancer patients reveals a potential new therapeutic target for this tumor. Moreover, the correlation between ALK amplification and nodal status suggests that ALK amplified tumors have a more aggressive phenotype. Further evaluation of the biological meaning of ALK amplification in colorectal cancer is ongoing.","title":"ALK chromosomal alterations in colon cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_52270-74"}
