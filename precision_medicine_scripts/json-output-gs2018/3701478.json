A standardized questionnaire was administered to proxy informants for decreased lung cancer patients and decreased nonpulmonary cancer control patients. No associations between lung cancer and specific beauty shop tasks, beauty product use, or environmental exposures were observed in the crude analysis or after controlling for smoking status. Case subjects had held more jobs outside of cosmetology than control subjects, but these jobs did not appear to be associated with any known hazardous exposures. Despite the elevated risk of lung cancer among female cosmetologists, researchers were unable to relate this excess to any specific occupational tasks or exposures. The excess of lung cancer in cosmetologists is most likely accounted for by a higher frequency of smoking in this occupational group.","title":"Investigation of lung cancer among female cosmetologists.","pubmedId":"3701478"}
