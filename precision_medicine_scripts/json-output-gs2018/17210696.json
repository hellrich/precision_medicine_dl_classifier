However, there are three Akt isoforms with limited information about their specificity during oncogenesis. This study addresses the role of the three isoforms in polyoma middle T (PyMT) and ErbB2/Neu-driven mammary adenocarcinomas in mice. The effects of ablation of Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 on the induction and the biology of these tumors were dramatically different, with ablation of Akt1 inhibiting, ablation of Akt2 accelerating, and ablation of Akt3 having a small, not statistically significant, inhibitory effect on tumor induction by both transgenes. Whereas PyMT-induced tumors are all invasive, Akt1(-/-)Neu-induced tumors are more invasive than Akt2(-/-)Neu-induced tumors. Invasiveness, however, does not always correlate with metastasis. Ablation of individual Akt isoforms does not affect the development of the mammary gland during puberty or the expression of the transgenes. Akt ablation, therefore, influences tumor induction by modulating transgene-induced oncogenic signaling. Immunostaining for Ki-67 and cyclin D1 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays on tissue sections revealed that the delay of tumor induction in Akt1 knockout mice is due to the inhibitory effects of Akt1 ablation on cell proliferation and survival. Given that these animal models exhibit significant similarities to human breast cancer, the results of the present study may have significant translational implications because they may influence how Akt inhibitors will be used in the treatment of human cancer.","title":"Akt1 ablation inhibits, whereas Akt2 ablation accelerates, the development of mammary adenocarcinomas in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-ErbB2/neu and MMTV-polyoma middle T transgenic mice.","pubmedId":"17210696"}
