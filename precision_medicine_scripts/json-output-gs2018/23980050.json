These data were compared with those with primary intra-mucosa gastric cancer (type I and II 275 cases, type III 68 cases).\nIn 43 cases of chronic gastric ulcer with early canceration, 30 cases (69.8%) were male, 22 cases (51.2%) were younger than 60 years old. Lesions located in the body or antrum of the stomach in 39 cases (90.7%), were less than 2 cm in 26 cases (60.5%), were undifferentiated type in 23 cases (53.5%), and developed lymph node metastasis in 4 cases (9.3%). Lesions of 4 cases of chronic gastric ulcer with early canceration located in the upper third of the stomach, while those of type III primary intra-mucosal gastric cancer all located in the lower two thirds, and the difference was statistically significant (P\u003c0.01). Compared to type III and type I and II primary intra-mucosal gastric cancer, chronic gastric ulcer with early canceration did not differ in clinicopathological characteristics such as histological type, vascular or lymphatic invasion, and lymph nodes metastasis (all P\u003e0.05). The median follow-up time was 57 months (range 16 to 98 months). The 5-year overall survival was 95.3% in chronic gastric ulcer with early canceration group, similar to that of type I, II (97.4%) or type III (94.5%) primary intra-mucosal gastric cancer group (P\u003e0.05).\nThe clinicopathological features of chronic gastric ulcer with early canceration are similar to those of primary intra-mucosal gastric cancer. The prognosis is promising for those patients undergoing surgical treatment.","title":"[Clinicopathological features and prognosis of chronic gastric ulcer with early canceration].","pubmedId":"23980050"}
