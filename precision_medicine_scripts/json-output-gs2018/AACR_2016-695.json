Here, we report that a SHP-2-upregulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducer, ZEB1 is important for PDGFR-driven glioma EMT, invasion and glioma stem cell renewal in mice and humans. ZEB1 and activated PDGFR were co-expressed in invasive regions of mouse glioma xenografts and human clinical glioma specimens. Glioma patients with high levels of both p-PDGFR and ZEB1 had significantly shorter overall survival compared with those with low expression of p-PDGFR and ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 inhibited PDGF-A/PDGFR-stimulated glioma EMT, tumor growth, invasion and glioma stem cell renewal. PDGFR mutant deficient of SHP-2 binding (PDGFR-F720) or PI3K binding (PDGFR-F731/42), knockdown of SHP-2 or treatments of pharmacological inhibitor for PDGFR-signaling effectors attenuated PDGF-A/PDGFR-stimulated ZEB1 expression, cell migration and glioma stem cell proliferation. Importantly, SHP-2 acts together with PI3K/Akt to regulate a ZEB1-miR-200 feedback loop in PDGFR-driven gliomas. Together, our findings uncover a new pathway in which ZEB1 functions as a key regulator for PDGFR-driven glioma EMT, invasion and glioma stem cell renewal, suggesting that ZEB1 as a potential therapeutic target for human gliomas with high PDGFR activation.","title":"SHP-2-upregulated ZEB1 is important for PDGFR-driven glioma epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion in mice and humans","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-695"}
