Gemcitabine and platinum-combinations (GP) form the standard approach for treating advanced BTC with a modest improvement in survival. To identify potential biomarkers for response to GP in BTC, we used NGS to evaluate the genomic BTC landscape and identify whether mutations affecting DNA repair were associated with GP resistance. Methods: Pretreatment formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from 183 patients (pts) with BTC treated with GP were analyzed with a commercial targeted NGS platform. Genes with incidence \u003e 10% were included in our analysis. Cox regression models were used to determine the association between mutations, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Survival was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Results: Of the 183 pts analyzed, 181 (99%) had at least one actionable mutation. The most common mutations included CDKN2A (29%), TP53 (27.9%), KRAS (22.4%), and ARID1A (13.7%). Considering genes with an incidence \u003e 10%, no individual gene was independently predictive of GP response. In pts with unresectable BTC who received GP as first-line therapy, the joint status of CDKN2A, TP53 and ARID1A were associated with PFS (P \u003d 0.0004) and OS (P \u003d \u003c 0.0001). Pts with mutations in CDKN2A and TP53 with wild-type ARID1A were identified as a poor prognostic cohort with a median PFS of 2.63 months (mos) and OS 5.22 mos. Pts with mutant ARID1A regardless of the single mutational status of TP53 or CDKN2A had statistically similar PFS and OS. In a single pt who exhibited mutations in all three genes, the median PFS was 20.37 mos and median OS not reached. Conclusions: In the largest exploratory analysis of this nature to date in BTC, we found that the presence of three prevalent and mutually exclusive mutations (TP53, CKDN2A and ARID1A) represent distinct pt cohorts. These mutations are prognostic and may represent a predictive biomarker to GP response. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings, including the incorporation of novel agents that exploit the genomic instability observed with these mutations with GP in BTC.","title":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) survey of biliary tract cancer (BTC) to reveal the association between tumor somatic variants and chemotherapy resistance.","pubmedId":"ASCO_168133-176"}
