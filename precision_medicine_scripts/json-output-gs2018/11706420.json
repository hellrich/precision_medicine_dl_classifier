The results were correlated with a new malignancy grading of the invasive tumour areas and the clinical outcome of the patients to estimate the individual prognosis. In conclusion, the amount of antigen expression of both antigens increases with the increasing grade of malignancy of the oral squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, there is a statistically significant correlation between the amount of antigen expression and the patient\u0027s prognosis. An overexpression of EGFR and PCNA is associated with a short survival of the patient. Both antigens detect relevant tumour biological parameters and are worthy factors in estimating the individual prognosis in patients suffering from oral squamous cell carcinomas.","title":"EGFR and PCNA expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas--a valuable tool in estimating the patient\u0027s prognosis.","pubmedId":"11706420"}
