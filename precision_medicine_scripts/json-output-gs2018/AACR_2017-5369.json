Up to 50% of the patients develop metastasis, which are notoriously resistant to all forms of therapy and despite medical treatment leads to death within a mean time of 5-7 months, with a mortality rate of over 90%. We previously described that gene expression profiling can be used to classy UM tumors into two basic categories, class 1 (low metastatic risk) and class 2 (high metastatic risk). We further described that inactivating mutations in the ubiquitin hydrolase BAP1 are found in over 85% of class 2 tumors. BAP1 is involved in removing ubiquitin from specific proteins to regulate their function, like histone H2A, thereby regulating gene expression.Building on these findings, we have generated uveal melanoma and melanocyte cell lines that allow for the inducible knockdown of BAP1. First, we performed RNAseq on multiple cell lines before and after BAP1 knockdown and compare the results to gene expression of class 1 and class 2 tumors. We identified significant overlap in key genes linked to metastasis between the primary tumors, uveal melanoma and melanocyte cell lines. Using ChIP-seq to interrogate uveal melanoma cells depleted of BAP1, we identified changes in genome wide histone marks and RNA polymerase localization associated with BAP1. To gain further insight into non-histone deubiquitination targets of BAP1, we performed ubiquitination proteomic profiling using the UbiScanÂ® technology and identified a list of high probability BAP1 substrates.Taken together, these complementary genome-wide investigations provide a global picture of the cellular functions of BAP1 and they provide novel insights into the metastasis-promoting effect of BAP1 loss in UM.","title":"Epigenetic, transciptomic and ubiquitomic changes associated with BAP1 loss in uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-5369"}
