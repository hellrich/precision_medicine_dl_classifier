The eldest sister was clinically diagnosed with HLRCC. The patients\u0027 father also carries the same mutation in the FH gene. The patients and their father are now undergoing yearly screening for renal cancer.\nPatients with HLRCC are at risk for developing renal cancer as well as losing their fertility via early hysterectomy. Physicians must be aware of this condition and refer at-risk individuals for genetic testing.","title":"Novel fumarate hydratase mutation in a family with atypical uterine leiomyomas and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer.","pubmedId":"26493120"}
