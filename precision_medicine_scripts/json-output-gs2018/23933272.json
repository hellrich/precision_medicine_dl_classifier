Most of the recurrent karyotypic rearrangements in AML have been defined as distinct disease entities in the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. In this paper we report an AML case showing a novel t(4;16)(q25;q23.1) rearrangement causing the activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and elongation of long-chain fatty acids family member 6 (ELOVL6) genes, rather than the generation of a novel fusion gene.
