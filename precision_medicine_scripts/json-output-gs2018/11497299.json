The aim of this study was to test, in the p53 mutant STS cell line US8-93, the effect of a combined treatment with DNA transfection--either with mdm2 antisense oligodesoxynucleotides (mdm2-AS) or with a wild-type p53-plasmid (wtp53)--and the effects of irradiation on radiosensitivity. Mdm2-sense oligodesoxynucleotides (mdm2-SE) and a GFP-plasmid (GFP) were applied as controls. In order to evaluate the treatment radiation sensitization (clonogenic survival), apoptotic cell death and P53/MDM2-protein expression were determined. A moderately increased radiation sensitization was observed when comparing clonogenic survival after 2 Gy irradiation between cells transfected either with the control mdm2-SE (48%) or with mdm-2 AS (30%). At the same irradiation dose, clonogenic survival of wtp53-plasmid transfected cells (32%) was about 2-fold less than in the cells transfected with the control GFP-plasmid (61%). This enhancement factor of radiation sensitization was increased by about 3-fold at 4 Gy irradiation. Furthermore, an increase in apoptotic cells was already detectable by up to 7.7% (mdm2-AS) in comparison to 3.1% (mdm2-SE control) 72 hours after transfection. In parallel, the percentage of apoptotic cells could be further elevated after subsequent irradiation with 12 Gy by up to 15% (mdm2-AS) compared to 5.7% (mdm2-SE control). A striking result was obtained with the combined treatment of a wtp53 and 12 Gy irradiation which produced in 25% and 38.9% of apoptotic cells 48 hours and 72 hours after transfection, respectively. We can therefore conclude that the sensitivity of radiation therapy is enhanced by DNA transfection with wtp53 or mdm-2 AS ODNs for the correction of the p53-mdm2 balance in STS in vitro.","title":"Transfection with mdm2-antisense or wtp53 results in radiosensitization and an increased apoptosis of a soft tissue sarcoma cell line.","pubmedId":"11497299"}
