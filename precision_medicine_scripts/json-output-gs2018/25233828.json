Physical examination additionally revealed primary acquired melanosis (PAM) on the palpebral conjunctiva of the same eyelid. Full thickness eyelid excision and conjunctival map biopsy identified desmoplastic melanoma of the eyelid in addition to invasive conjunctival melanoma and conjunctival melanoma in situ. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative for metastasis. She was treated with surgical excision for the eyelid melanoma and topical mitomycin C for the conjunctival melanoma. We discuss the rare entity of desmoplastic melanoma of the eyelid and its possible association with NF1.
