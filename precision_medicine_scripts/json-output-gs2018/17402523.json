This oncological surgery is best performed at the same sitting as a one staged procedure.\nA clinical case of a 56-year-old female with advanced hypopharyngeal cancer who had a single stage total pharyngolaryngectomy and partial oesophagectomy with reconstruction of the upper aerodigestive tract using pectoralis major pedicled flap and post operative adjunct chemo-radiation therapy.\nFunctionally, our patient had good swallowing reflex, fed on normal diet free of feeding tube and no gastric reflux. There was clinical evidence of weight gain. No evidence of flap complications post surgery.\nThe rarity of this procedure and its advantages in the management of an advanced hypopharyngeal cancer in this environment are discussed.","title":"Surgical management of advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma: a case report and literature review.","pubmedId":"17402523"}
