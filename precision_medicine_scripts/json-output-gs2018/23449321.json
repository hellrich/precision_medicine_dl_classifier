The databases of 12 French institutions were searched for primary vaginal melanomas managed between 1990 and 2007. Among the 54 patients recorded, 46 were managed with a curative intent and included in the study. The clinical characteristics, treatments, and detection of c-KIT protein expression have been studied. The median age of the patients was 63.5 years (42-88). Twenty-eight patients were classified as International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, five as stage II, six as stage III, and one as stage IVA. c-KIT protein was overexpressed in 80% of the patients. Forty-two patients underwent surgical resection of the tumor, nine patients received local adjuvant treatment, and 10 received systemic adjuvant therapy. The median relapse-free survival was 10.9 months. c-KIT-negative status (P\u003d0.01) and stage I (P\u003d0.02) were associated with locoregional recurrence. The rate of metastasis was increased for advanced FIGO stages (P\u003c0.01). The median overall survival (OS) was 28.4 months. The finding of lymph node metastasis adversely affected OS (P\u003c0.01). Conservative surgery and radiotherapy were associated with a decrease in metastasis-free and OS (P\u003c0.01) compared with surgery alone, this group of patients presenting with advanced FIGO stages (P\u003d0.02). Despite the use of limited data, conservative surgery combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy could be proposed to patients with early FIGO stage in the absence of validated management. c-KIT negativity by immunochemistry appears to be a poor prognosis marker in terms of locoregional recurrences but not for metastatic spread nor survival. Further assessment of the role of c-KIT expression in this disease is thus mandatory to select patients for targeted therapy.","title":"A large retrospective multicenter study of vaginal melanomas: implications for new management.","pubmedId":"23449321"}
