Genetic analysis revealed a RET proto-oncogene codon 620 mutation. Genetic testing has revolutionised the management of medullary thyroid carcinoma. The genetic basis of hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma lies with the RET proto-oncogene. Several disease-causing mutations of this gene have been identified and their clinical prognosis described. The penetrance of these mutations is high; as such, carriers progress to develop medullary thyroid carcinoma at a young age. Mutations at the codon 620 position are classified as high-risk for early development of medullary thyroid carcinoma; thus, the current recommendation is for prophylactic thyroidectomy at five years of age.\nIn this case, the progress of hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma was unique, considering the late presentation of medullary thyroid carcinoma despite the presence of the high-risk RET proto-oncogene codon 620 mutation. The authors wish to highlight the importance of this case, as it may present a counter-argument to the current recommendations for early, prophylactic thyroidectomy in codon 620 mutation carriers in order to prevent early development of medullary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"New presentation of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma in 87-year-old patient with high-risk RET proto-oncogene codon 620 mutation.","pubmedId":"18771606"}
