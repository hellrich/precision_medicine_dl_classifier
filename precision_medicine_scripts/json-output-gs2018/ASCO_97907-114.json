IDH mutations have been associated with a globally hypermethylated genomic state, as the result of increased levels of 2-HG, a regulator of histone methylation. We sought to retrospectively determine responses of patients with IDH-mutated AML to treatment with hypomethylating agents.  Methods:  We reviewed clinical data for AML patients treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from June 2001 to December 2011 whose stored leukemia samples from bone marrow aspirateshad been tested retrospectively for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. We searched three databases that contained records for 407 AML patients. We selected patients who had been treated with the hypomethylating agents 5-azacitidine or decitabine, alone or in conjunction with other therapeutics. We retrospectively reviewed the patients medical records to obtain demographic, laboratory, treatment, and clinical data. We evaluated response measured by remission status, reduction in bone marrow blasts and peripheral blood blasts, and time to relapse.  Results:  We identified 104 patients (25.6%) who had either an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, and of these, 8 patients had also been treated with hypomethylating agents. A ninth AML patient, who is IDH2-mutant, is currently undergoing treatment with decitabine alone. Of these 9 patients, three had a durable complete remission without recovery of blood counts (CRp), three had a partial response (PR), with or without blood count recovery, and three had no response. All 9 patients did have an initial decrease in the percentage of bone marrow blasts, peripheral blood blasts, or both.  Conclusions:  This series of patients demonstrates the possibility that AML patients with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations benefit from the use of hypomethylating agents, and suggests it is worthwhile to prospectively investigate treatment of patients with IDH-mutated AML using hypomethylating agents.","title":"AML patients with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations treated with hypomethylating agents: A case series.","pubmedId":"ASCO_97907-114"}
