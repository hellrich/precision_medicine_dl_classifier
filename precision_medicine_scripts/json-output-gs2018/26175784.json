{"keywords":["Lung","Melanoma"],"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Malignant melanoma occurs most frequently on the skin. However, it can also arise in other organs and tissues of the body. Primary pulmonary malignant melanoma is a very rare non-epithelial neoplasm accounting for 0.01% of all primary pulmonary tumors. The treatment of choice is surgical resection of the tumor with an oncologically adequate margin as in lobectomy or pneumonectomy. The prognosis of this condition is rather poor. Based on previous data, its 5-year survival is at least 10%. Here, we report a case of an 82-year-old woman whose primary pulmonary melanoma was detected incidentally.
