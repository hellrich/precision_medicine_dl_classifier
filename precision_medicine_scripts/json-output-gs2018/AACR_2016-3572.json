Mcl1, an anti-apoptotic protein that has been linked to increased survival and chemotherapy resistance in various cancers, can be indirectly modulated through transient inhibition of Cdk9 due to it having a short-lived transcript and being a labile protein. Transient inhibition of Cdk9, therefore, represents a potential therapeutic opportunity in tumors dependent on Mcl1 for survival, including various hematological malignancies. AZ5576 is a potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of Cdk9 that inhibits Cdk9 enzyme activity with an IC50 \u003c5nM and decreases phosphorlyation of Ser2-RNAPII in cells with an IC50 of 96nM. In the MLL-fusion containing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) line, MV411, short-term treatment with AZ5576 led to a rapid dose-dependent decrease in pSer2-RNAPII with concomitant loss of Mcl1 mRNA and protein, resulting in the cleavage and activation of caspase 3 and loss of cell viability. However, protein expression of other Bcl2 family members (e.g. Bcl2, BclxL, Bim) remained unchanged. Further, AZ5576 induced rapid caspase activation and loss of viability in a diverse set of hematological cancer cell lines, including those from acute myeloid leukemia (16/20), multiple myeloma (10/19), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (8/13). In vivo efficacy with intermittent dosing of AZ5576 was also demonstrated in multiple xenograft models from each hematological tumor type. Finally, AZ5576 was still able to induce loss of viability in various multiple myeloma lines cultured in the presence of cytokines or bone marrow stromal cells that represent potential protective effects of the tumor microenvironment. Together, these results highlight the therapeutic potential for selective CDK9 inhibition in the treatment of hematological malignancies.","title":"AZ5576, a novel potent and selective CDK9 inhibitor, induces rapid cell death and achieves efficacy in multiple preclinical hematological models","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3572"}
