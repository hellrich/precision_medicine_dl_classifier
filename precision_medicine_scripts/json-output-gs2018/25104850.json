Here we identify neuroblastoma-suppressive functions of the p19-INK4d CDK inhibitor and uncover mechanisms of its repression in high-risk neuroblastomas. Reduced p19-INK4d expression was associated with poor event-free and overall survival and neuroblastoma risk factors including amplified MYCN in a set of 478 primary neuroblastomas. High MYCN expression repressed p19-INK4d mRNA and protein levels in different neuroblastoma cell models with conditional MYCN expression. MassARRAY and 450K methylation analyses of 105 primary neuroblastomas uncovered a differentially methylated region within p19-INK4d. Hypermethylation of this region was associated with reduced p19-INK4d expression. In accordance, p19-INK4d expression was activated upon treatment with the demethylating agent, 2\u0027-deoxy-5-azacytidine, in neuroblastoma cell lines. Ectopic p19-INK4d expression decreased viability, clonogenicity and the capacity for anchorage-independent growth of neuroblastoma cells, and shifted the cell cycle towards the G1/0 phase. p19-INK4d also induced neurite-like processes and markers of neuronal differentiation. Moreover, neuroblastoma cell differentiation, induced by all-trans retinoic acid or NGF-NTRK1-signaling, activated p19-INK4d expression. Our findings pinpoint p19-INK4d as a neuroblastoma suppressor and provide evidence for MYCN-mediated repression and for epigenetic silencing of p19-INK4d by DNA hypermethylation in high-risk neuroblastomas.
