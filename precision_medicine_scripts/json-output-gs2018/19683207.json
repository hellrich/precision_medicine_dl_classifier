CCs are generally unresectable locally invasive tumors that occlude the biliary tree leading to fatal cholangitis and liver failure. Biliary decompression via stenting offers symptomatic relief but does not control tumor growth. Founded on an initial case study followed by ever more sophisticated clinical research, including randomized trials, photodynamic therapy has garnered enough momentum to be considered as part of the standard of care for these patients. Further, preliminary clinical data show the potential for benefit of the use of PDT in a neoadjuvant and adjuvant fashion to the minority of patients currently considered resectable or of border line resectability. PDT also impacts interleukin-6 levels and may form the basis for a targeted therapy approach to this disease. We review the clinical rationale, current studies and potential future directions of PDT for patients with CC.","title":"Cholangiocarcinoma: an emerging indication for photodynamic therapy.","pubmedId":"19683207"}
