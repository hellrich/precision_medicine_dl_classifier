Recent evidence indicates that HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) recognize melanomas obtained from different HLA-A2+ patients, suggesting the presence of one or more common melanoma antigens. Furthermore, T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis by other groups of TILs from fresh melanoma biopsies suggests that there is limited TCR V gene usage in TILs. One serious limitation in analyzing the TCR repertoire in fresh tumors has been the inability to correlate TCR usage with immune function. Therefore, the TCR repertoire was determined in long-term TIL cultures that specifically lysed autologous melanoma in vitro and in many cases mediated in vivo regression of metastatic cancer in patients with advanced disease. The TCR repertoire in cultured melanoma-specific TILs was diverse, with each TIL containing an average of 9.5 +/- 5.7 of the 23 V alpha and 11.2 +/- 5.9 of the 23 V beta subfamilies. Despite the large diversity observed, several V alpha and V beta genes (V alpha 1, V alpha 2, V alpha 22, V beta 13, V beta 14, and V beta 18) are very commonly found in melanoma-specific TILs. No statistically significant associations were observed between the presence of a TCR V gene subfamily in TILs and clinical response, HLA haplotype, or age of the culture. Even though the results in this study suggest that certain TCR V gene segments may be involved in immune responses to human melanoma, we were unable to demonstrate functionally that a particular T-cell clonotype recognizes melanoma tumor-associated antigens. Only the analysis of melanoma-specific CTL clones can determine which clonotypes are important in lysis of human melanoma.","title":"T-cell receptor repertoire in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.
