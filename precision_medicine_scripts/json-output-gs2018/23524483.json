The thickness of the lesion at diagnosis is one of the most important prognostic indicators for survival, which is good for thin melanomas (â‰¤1 mm) and worsens as thickness increases. Nevertheless, it is not rare to observe disease progression of thin melanomas or, conversely, a good outcome for those melanomas considered to be at high risk, according to the classical prognostic criteria. In the present paper, we analysed for the first time the expression of the hERG1 protein, a potassium channel frequently overexpressed and misexpressed in cancers, in cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The analysis was carried out on archival samples relative to (a) typical melanocytic nevi, (b) atypical melanocytic nevi, (c) thin (\u003c1 mm) melanomas from patients who survived at least 10 years after surgery, (d) thick (\u003e4 mm) melanomas from patients who died for melanoma and (e) melanoma metastases. Samples were analysed by immunohistochemistry using an hERG1-specific antibody. We showed that primary cutaneous melanomas with a thickness greater than 4 mm as well as metastatic melanoma lesions are characterized by a high level of hERG1 expression. Conversely, thin melanomas and benign melanocytic lesions (e.g. typical and atypical melanocytic nevi) express hERG1 at significantly lower levels. Although still preliminary, the data presented here enable us to consider hERG1 as a novel candidate biomarker for aggressive melanoma.","title":"High hERG1 expression in advanced melanoma.","pubmedId":"23524483"}
