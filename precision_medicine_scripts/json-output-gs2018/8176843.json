Point mutation of the ras oncogene, amplification of the myc oncogene, and overexpression of the erbB2 oncogene are associated with poor prognosis of lung carcinomas. Mutation of p53 anti-oncogene is a common event of lung carcinoma and the differences in its mutation pattern can be used for the molecular diagnosis of multicentric lung carcinomas.","title":"[Molecular diagnosis of lung carcinoma].","pubmedId":"8176843"}
