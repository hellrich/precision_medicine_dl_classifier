In an effort to identify inhibitors of NTRK1 and ROS1, which are inappropriately activated in NSCLC, we created and screened a library of existing targeted drugs against BaF3 cells transformed with these oncogenes. This screen identified the FDA-approved drug cabozantinib as a potent inhibitor of CD74-ROS1 (IC50 \u003d 9 nM), including the crizotinib-resistant mutants G2032R (IC50 \u003d 26 nM) and L2026M (IC50 \u003d 11 nM), with no inhibition of the parental BaF3 cells (IC50 \u003e 10 M). AP26113, a dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor undergoing phase I/II clinical trials, also potently inhibited CD74-ROS1 (IC50 \u003d 4 nM), including the crizotinib-resistant mutants G2032R (IC50 \u003d 206 nM) and L2026M (IC50 \u003d 84 nM), with weak inhibition of the parental BaF3 cells (IC50 \u003e 1 M). Both cabozantinib and AP26113 inhibited ROS1 autophosphorylation and downstream ERK activation in CD74-ROS transformed BaF3 cells and in the ROS1-rearranged NSCLC cell line HCC78. The FGFR3 inhibitor dovitinib, which is in phase III clinical trials for renal cell carcinoma, potently inhibited NTRK1 compared to parental BaF3 cells (IC50 \u003d 69 nM vs \u003e 1 M), and blocked NTRK1 autophosphorylation and ERK activation. While acquired resistance to targeted therapies is a major clinical problem, this study highlights other existing agents that may overcome resistance, and identifies several promising candidates for clinical trials.","title":"Identification of existing targeted agents that inhibit NTRK and ROS1 in lung cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-3644"}
