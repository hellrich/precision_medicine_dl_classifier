After 8 years, he presented with pancytopenia. Marrow examination showed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with trilineage myelodysplasia (MDS). Cytogenetic analysis showed an unbalanced der(1;7)(p10;q10) that resulted effectively in deletion 7q; confirming the diagnosis of therapy-related AML (t-AML). No residual CLL was present. Together with previous reports of secondary cancers after fludarabine treatment and the association of monosomy 7/7q- with another purine analogue azathioprine, results suggest that t-AML might develop after fludarabine therapy.","title":"Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia after single-agent treatment with fludarabine for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","pubmedId":"16044456"}
