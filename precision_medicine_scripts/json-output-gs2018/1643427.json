She had received clomiphene treatment for nearly 2 years previously. She developed two more primary melanomas 15 and 21 months after giving birth. All melanomas were histologically associated with preexisting dysplastic naevi. The patient showed the characteristic phenotype of the dysplastic naevus syndrome; a cousin and an aunt were treated for malignant melanoma and the patient\u0027s brother had histologically confirmed dysplastic naevi. The course of her first two pregnancies was not complicated by the development of melanomas. We suggest that clomiphene may have played a role in the activation or progression of these \u0027precursor lesions\u0027 into malignant melanoma.","title":"Multiple primary melanomas in a patient with familial-type DNS during clomiphene-induced pregnancy.","pubmedId":"1643427"}
