We report the first case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) disseminated to the placenta. The diagnosis was made via excisional biopsy of cervical lymphadenopathy in a 20-year-old woman at 27 weeks\u0027 gestation. Involvement of the placenta was noted on gross examination after cesarean section delivery of a girl at 30 weeks\u0027 gestation. The ALCL was microscopically confined to intervillous spaces in a manner similar to previous reports of other NHLs. The immunophenotype was characteristic (CD30+, EMA+, BNH9+), and the now frequently associated t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation with this lymphoma was detected by the recently produced monoclonal antibody ALK1 against the nucleophosmin/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM/ALK) chimeric protein. Complete remission was induced in the mother after delivery. Both mother and child are healthy at 10 years\u0027 follow-up. The case is reported in light of the sparse literature on lymphomatous involvement of the placenta.","title":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma of maternal origin involving the placenta: case report and literature survey.","pubmedId":"9331298"}
