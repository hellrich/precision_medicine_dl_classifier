Survivals were compared with age- and stage-matched control cases of HNSCC.\nA total of 333 cases of HNSCC after lymphoma (53 Hodgkin\u0027s and 280 non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphomas) were identified as occurring on average 70.7 months after lymphoma. Post-lymphoma HNSCC cases exhibited poorer mean (median) Kaplan-Meier overall survival of 57.0 months (29.0 months) vs 84.2 months (42.0 months) for controls (P \u003d 0.008). However, after exclusion of lymphoma-related deaths, post-lymphoma HNSCC survival improved to 63.9 (86.3) months (P \u003d 0.191). HNSCC occurring after Hodgkin\u0027s disease exhibited better mean survival (92.5 months) than extranodal non-Hodgkin\u0027s (43.5 months) and nodal non-Hodgkin\u0027s (50.7 months) disease (P \u003d 0.049).\nPatients with HNSCC with prior lymphoma, especially non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma, exhibit poorer survival than first primary HNSCC cases.","title":"Survival outcomes for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma arising after lymphoma.","pubmedId":"18312890"}
