Here we report that CD151, a member of the tetraspanin family and a close partner of the laminin-binding (LB) integrins (31 and 64), contributes to the onset and malignancy of ErbB2-induced mammary tumors. By crossing gene-targeted mice onto a clinically-relevant MMTV-ErbB2 transgenic model, we demonstrated that deletion of CD151 significantly impaired the onset and metastasis of mammary tumors in mice. Our subsequent analyses of cell lines derived from mouse primary tumors showed that loss of CD151 decreased integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion and cell-cell contacts. Also, for ErbB2-overexpressing MCF-10A cells cultured in 2D or 3D, ablation of CD151 markedly reduced tumor cell motility, invasion and survival. However, only MAPK and FAK kinases among an array of signaling molecules downstream of integrins and ErbB receptors, exhibited a decreased activation in response to CD151 disruption. Importantly, there were corresponding changes in the activation and signaling of 64 integrin, as reflected by decreased phosphorylation of multiple serine residues at its cytoplasmic domain. Also, the cross-talk between integrins and ErbB receptors was strongly inhibited. Meanwhile, our analyses of clinical dataset revealed a strong correlation between CD151 gene expression and patients metastasis-free survival. Taken together, our results demonstrate that tetraspanin CD151 drives ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis by coordinating the function and signaling of LB integrins. This newly-identified crucial role of CD151 offers a strong therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer patients.","title":"Tetraspanin CD151 drives mammary tumor onset and metastasis by coordinating integrin-dependent cell adhesion, motility, survival and signaling","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2704"}
