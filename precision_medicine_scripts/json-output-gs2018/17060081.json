This locus harbours the CDKN2A/ARF tumour suppressor gene, which encodes two cell-cycle regulatory proteins: p16INK4a and p14ARF. We studied how homozygous deletions and multiple duplications at this locus affect prognosis and survival in patients with bladder cancer.\nReal-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), based on simultaneous amplification of ARF and a reference gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was used to measure homozygous deletions and multiple duplications in a population-based material consisting of 478 patients with urinary bladder cancer. Results from real-time QPCR were compared with clinico-pathological parameters and survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nReal-time QPCR analysis showed 71 (15%) homozygous deletions and 8 (2%) multiple duplications. We were unable to find any association between either stage or grade and urinary neoplasms with homozygous deletions. However, although there were only a limited number of patients with multiple duplications, 7/8 of them had highly malignant tumours (G2b-G4 or \u003e or \u003d T1; p \u003d 0.02).\nUrinary bladder cancers constitute a spectrum of neoplasms with varying clinical manifestations. We were unable to establish a prognostic relevance for patients with tumours harbouring homozygous deletions at the CDKN2A/ARF locus. However, our data did indicate that patients with multiple duplications at the CDKN2A/ARF locus had poor survival. This suggests that multiple duplications, in combination with other genetic changes, have cooperative effects which have a negative outcome on urinary bladder cancer prognosis.","title":"Prognostic significance of homozygous deletions and multiple duplications at the CDKN2A (p16INK4a)/ARF (p14ARF) locus in urinary bladder cancer.","pubmedId":"17060081"}
