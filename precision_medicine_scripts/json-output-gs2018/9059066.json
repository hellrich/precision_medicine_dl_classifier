In June 1994, her condition gradually worsened after acute pneumoniae in her right lung. Intravenous hyperalimentation with cimetidine administration was started to improve her undernourishment, because she had a history of gastric ulcer. However, after 10 days from the start of cimetidine therapy, anemia progressed rapidly. Biochemical examinations revealed that the serum indirect bilirubin and LDH levels were elevated and no serum haptoglobin was detected. These results indicated the development of hemolytic anemia, but at that time we could not clarify the reason. In October 1994, thrombocytopenia gradually progressed, and we halted the administration of cimetidine to ranitidine. Both hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia was dramatically improved after cessation of cimetidine administration. We then changed the drug from cimetidine, however the same phenomena have appeared again. The patient was in stable condition, after cessation of H2-blockers administration. The complication of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia associated with H2-blocker administration in Japan.","title":"[Hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia induced by cimetidine: recurrence with ranitidine administration].","pubmedId":"9059066"}
