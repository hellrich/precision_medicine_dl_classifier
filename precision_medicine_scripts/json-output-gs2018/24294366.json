The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of EGFR mutations in NSCLC detected in cytological and histological material and present literature review on European EGFR mutation incidence. 273 patients with confirmed NSCLC were entered into the study: 189 histological, paraffin-embedded materials, 12 fresh and 72 fixed cytological specimens. DNA was extracted from both types of material and the EGFR mutation in exons 18-21 was analyzed by direct sequencing. In addition the EGFR gene copy number in cases with sufficient histological material (110 patients) was evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. The percentage of EGFR somatic mutations was 10.62%. FISH positive results (amplification or high polysomy of EGFR gene) were identified in 33 patients (30.0%). The strongest clinicopathological correlation with the EGFR mutation was found for histological type (adenocarcinoma; p \u003c 0.01), gender (females; p \u003c 0.01) and FISH positive result (p \u003c 0.05). This is the first, single institution study that estimates the EGFR mutation incidence in the Polish population. Cytological material recovered from fixed preparations and stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed DNA quality comparable to fresh tumor cells and histological samples.
