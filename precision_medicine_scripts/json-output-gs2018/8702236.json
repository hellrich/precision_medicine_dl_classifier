Significantly more advanced ovarian carcinomas (p \u003d 0.034) expressed high levels of nm23 when compared to borderline tumours. HER-2/neu (c-erb-B2) expression, as could be expected, was also significantly more frequent in advanced ovarian carcinomas (p \u003d 0.006). We were not able to find the previously reported association between nm23 and HER-2/neu overexpression in our tumours. Our results on nm23 overexpression in ovarian cancer are coincident with those previously reported using nm23-mRNA measurements on fresh ovarian tissues. Thus, ovarian carcinoma seems to belong to the group of tumours, like colon carcinoma and neuroblastoma, in which nm23 overexpression is associated with a more malignant phenotype. Immunohistochemistry performed on archival samples from ovarian carcinomas seems adequate for the demonstration of nm23 overexpression in ovarian cancer. This opens the possibility for larger studies on series of patients with a closed follow-up, which could help to establish the role of this gene in this kind of tumour.","title":"nm23 expression in advanced and borderline ovarian carcinoma.","pubmedId":"8702236"}
