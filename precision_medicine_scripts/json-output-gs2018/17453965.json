However, obtaining lymphocytes and subsequent expansion is labor intensive, making it impractical for broad clinical application. Allogeneic transplantation may have anti-melanoma efficacy because of a graft vs. tumor effect. The disappointing tumor control observed post-transplant suggests that adoptive immunotherapy using melanoma-reactive cells will be essential for sustained responses.\nMelanoma cell lines were grown from two patients with advanced disease. High-level CD80 and CD86 expression was obtained in the tumor lines using a retroviral vector for gene transfer. Transduced melanoma and controls were cultured with mononuclear cells from HLA-identical sibling donors.\nExpression of CD80 and CD86, particularly the former, promoted marked expansion of lymphocytes from HLA-matched sibling donors. Proliferation of up to 300-fold after 4 weeks of culture was observed. Lymphocytes from cultures stimulated with CD80 demonstrated cytotoxicity against recipient-untransfected melanoma (45-75% specific lysis at an E:T ratio of 50:1). Although expanded lymphocytes were predominantly CD4(+), cytotoxicity was greatest in the numerically smaller CD8(+) subpopulation. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells secreted IFN-gamma (but not IL-4) on exposure to untransduced stimulator melanoma cells.\nOur strategy generates a large number of melanoma-reactive lymphocytes from HLA-identical siblings using a 4-week culture strategy. Lymphocytes expanded in this way offer an alternative to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for allogeneic cellular immunotherapy after stem cell transplantation in young patients.","title":"Rapid expansion of tumor-reactive cells from HLA-matched siblings for adoptive immunotherapy of melanoma.","pubmedId":"17453965"}
