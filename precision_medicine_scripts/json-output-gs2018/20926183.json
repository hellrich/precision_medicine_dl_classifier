Here we describe two novel Hsp90 inhibitors, PF-4470296 and PF-3823863, demonstrate a differential sensitivity in B-Raf mutant (V600E) versus wild-type protein degradation. These two inhibitors inhibit proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, and abolish in vivo xenograft tumor growth in melanoma cells regardless of B-Raf mutation status. Mutant B-Raf protein and other Hsp90 clients, such as cMet, ErbB2, C-Raf, and AKT, are degraded in cells and xenograft tumors. Our results indicate that Hsp90 inhibitors induce anti-tumor activity in melanoma cells and are likely to show therapeutic benefit in melanoma patients by collaboratively targeting multiple pathways.","title":"A novel class of specific Hsp90 small molecule inhibitors demonstrate in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in human melanoma cells.","pubmedId":"20926183"}
