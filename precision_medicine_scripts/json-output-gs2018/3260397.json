Increased serum osteocalcin was recently reported in hyperthyroid patients and its decrease after 4-8 months of treatment. Osteocalcin was measured by RIA in the sera of 211 women and 18 men with thyroid diseases. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to diagnosis: I. polynodular goitre and subacute thyroiditis (59 women, 5 men); II. Graves\u0027 disease (70 women, 3 men) and III. thyroid cancer, after treatment by surgery and 131I (82 women, 10 men). The osteocalcin levels in the sera of these patients were: 2.97 +/- 2.63 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) for the women and 3.56 +/- 2.10 ng/ml for the men in the 1st group; 16.31 +/- 11.34 ng/ml for the women and 12.75 +/- 6.09 ng/ml for the man in the IInd group and, 1.01 +/- 0.60 ng/ml for the women and 0.78 +/- 0.46 ng/ml for the men in the IIIrd group. No differences were found between the osteocalcin concentrations in the hyperthyroid female patients treated with antithyroid drugs (no \u003d 58) and the non-treated hyperthyroid women (no \u003d 12): 16.22 +/- 11.40 ng/ml vs 16.74 +/- +/- 11.53 ng/ml. These data suggest that bone resorption stimulated by endogenous thyroid-hormones is a rather resistant processus, persisting even after 6-8 mos of associated anti-thyroid therapy. Further are analyzed the possible causes of the subnormal osteocalcin levels observed in patients with thyroid cancer treated by surgery and radioisotope, whose suppression therapy was discontinued 2-3 weeks before blood sampling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"The serum osteocalcin levels in patients with thyroid diseases.","pubmedId":"3260397"}
