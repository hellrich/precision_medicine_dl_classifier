We investigated MDM2 SNP309 and CDKN1A (p21/Waf1/Cip1) codon 31 (rs1801270) polymorphisms in 86 cases of cutaneous Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma (KS) from African and Caucasian patients, and 210 healthy controls. A significant increase of the MDM2 SNP309 T/G genotype was observed among classic KS cases (odds ratio 2.38, 95% confidence interval 1.0-5.5). Frequencies of CDKN1A codon 31 genotypes were not significantly different between cases and controls. The results suggest that the MDM2 SNP309 G allele may act as a susceptibility gene for the development of classic KS in Caucasian patients.","title":"MDM2 and CDKN1A gene polymorphisms and risk of Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma in African and Caucasian patients.","pubmedId":"20979563"}
