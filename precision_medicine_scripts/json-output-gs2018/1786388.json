The diagnoses were verified histologically (I-II grade gliomas-4 cases, grade III gliomas-3 cases, grade IV gliomas-6 cases). It was established that grade IV gliomas were most sensitive to NK-lysis. Treatment of tumor cells with neuraminidase increased the sensitivity to NK-lysis of grade I-III glioma cells and did not influence the sensitivity of grade IV gliomas. It is suggested that glycoprotein oligosaccharides of glial tumour cell membranes may play the role of target structures for lymphocytes-killers.","title":"[Sensitivity of human glial tumor cells of different grade of anaplasia to lysis due to natural killers depending on some characteristics of the glycoprotein structure of tumor cell membranes].","pubmedId":"1786388"}
