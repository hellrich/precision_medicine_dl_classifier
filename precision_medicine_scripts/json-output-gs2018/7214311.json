While histologic features were comparable the patient\u0027s age at the time of diagnosis was lower and lymph node metastases were more frequent in familial than in nonfamilial cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma from the same region. We conclude that genetic factors can predispose the patient for development of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The high local incidence may be due to interaction between susceptibility gene(s) and environmental factors.","title":"Familial occurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"7214311"}
