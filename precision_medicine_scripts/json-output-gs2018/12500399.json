(2) There was strongly expression of ALK in hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant astrocytoma, and medulloblastoma. (3) There was weakly expression of ALK in placenta tissue and astrocyte.\n(1) The ALK protein is a very important molecular marker in ALCL, it is very helpful for diagnosing and distinquishing ALCL. (2) ALK gene may take part in the origin and development of hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant astrocytoma, and medulloblastoma and may be an important gene associated with neoplasms.","title":"[Significance of ALK gene expression in neoplasms and normal tissues].","pubmedId":"12500399"}
