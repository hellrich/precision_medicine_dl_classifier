Carriers of the delta 32 gene (D32) mutation who lack CCR5 are protected from HIV infection by the R5 variant of the virus. Heterozygotes have slower progression to AIDS. For HIV NHL patients, the effects of the presence of the gene mutation are unclear. Methods: 93samples obtained from the ASCR (AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource ) tissue bank of  patients with HIV NHL were assayed for the presence of the mutation. We then studied if there was an association with the  mutation and subtype of diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (germinal center GC vs non GC), EBV status, or cell activation markers. Date of NHL diagnosis was from 1989 to 2005. Samples predating 1996 were characterized as pre HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) and all others post HAART. Results: There were 87 DLBCL, 3 plasmablastic lymphoma, 2 plasmacytoma and 1 anaplastic large cell T-cell subtype.  Of the DLBCL, 48 were GC subtype and 39 were non GC subtype. GC subtype was 8.3 % (4/48) heterozygous for the D32. Non GCB subtype was 10.3 % (4/29) heterozygous. There was no difference in the percent heterozygosity for D32 pre or post HAART (14.8% vs 11.1%). The pre HAART specimens had greater EBV+ (44% vs 29% P\u003d0.16)   and more frequent BLIMP(B lymphocyte induced maturation protein) positivity ( 27% vs 17%. P\u003d0.39) ).   CCR5 heterozygous mutants were less often BLIMP positive (10% vs 21.4% P\u003d0.68) and more often overexpressed p53 by immunostain (40% vs 23.9% P\u003d0.47) compared to wild type CCR5.  There was no correlation between EBV status and the presence of the mutation (36.3% vs 33.3%). Conclusions: CCR5 gene mutation status did not influence the subtype of DLCL. but the differences seen in BLIMP expression may have implications. Additional larger studies are needed to bear out suggested but statistically non-significant trends.  BLIMP is a known repressor of p53.  The overexpression of p53 and decreased BLIMP seen in CCR5 heterozygotes suggests alternate oncogenic pathways may be operative compared to wild type CCR5 lymphoma patients. Our ongoing clinical trial of HIV NHL pts undergoing transplant is assessing CCR5 status to see if there is a correlation with disease free and overall survival.","title":"What is the significance of CCR5 status in HIV-associated non-Nodgkin lymphoma (NHL)-","pubmedId":"ASCO_93425-114"}
