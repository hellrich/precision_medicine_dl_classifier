We investigated the response rate and safety of weekly DHA-paclitaxel in metastatic melanoma patients. We enrolled chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic nonchoroidal melanoma using the two-stage Fleming design. At least one response was needed in the first stage to proceed to the second stage. DHA-paclitaxel (500 mg/m/week by 1-h intravenous infusion) was administered for 5 weeks every 6-week cycle until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or treatment refusal. Response and toxicity were assessed every 6 weeks and weekly, respectively. Thirty patients were enrolled. The patients\u0027 median age was 67 years (range: 29-86 years). The median number of treatment cycles was 2 (range: 1-6 cycles). Three patients (10%) had partial responses; one lasted 4 months, and two lasted 5.6 months. Fifteen patients (50%) had stable disease with a median duration of 2.8 months (range: 2.6-8.9 months). The median survival was 14.8 months. Neutropenia (10%) and musculoskeletal pain (10%) were the most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities, and fatigue (73%), skin rash (70%), and diarrhea (60%) were the most common side effects. As a single-agent therapy, DHA-paclitaxel was well tolerated in metastatic melanoma patients. Its efficacy as a first-line therapy for metastatic melanoma does not exceed that seen with other single-agent chemotherapies such as dacarbazine. Further evaluation of DHA-paclitaxel in combination with other chemotherapy or targeted agents could be considered.","title":"Phase 2 open-label study of weekly docosahexaenoic acid-paclitaxel in cutaneous and mucosal metastatic melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"19521262"}
