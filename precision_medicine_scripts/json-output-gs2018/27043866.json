The drugs, pembrolizumab and nivolumab are recently approved inhibitors of the programmed death (PD)-1 receptor that have overlapping AE profiles however, the incidence, relative risk (RR), and clinico-morphological pattern of the associated dermatologic AEs are not known.\nWe conducted a systematic review of the literature, and performed a meta-analysis of dermatologic AEs observed with the use of pembrolizumab and nivolumab in cancer patients. An electronic search was conducted using the PubMed, and Web of Science, and on the American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Society for Medical Oncology meeting abstracts\u0027 libraries for potentially relevant oncology trials, that employed the drugs at Food and Drug Administration-approved doses and reported dermatologic AEs. The incidence, RR and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using either random- or fixed-effects models based on the heterogeneity of included studies. The clinical presentation, histology of affected skin areas, and management strategies (based on institutional experience), are also presented.\nRash, pruritus and vitiligo were found to be the most frequently reported dermatologic AEs. The calculated incidence of all-grade rash with pembrolizumab and nivolumab was 16.7% (RR \u003d 2.6) and 14.3% (RR \u003d 2.5), respectively. Other significant all-grade AEs included pruritus (pembrolizumab: incidence, 20.2% [RR \u003d 49.9]; nivolumab: incidence, 13.2% [RR \u003d 34.5]) and vitiligo (pembrolizumab: incidence, 8.3% [RR \u003d 17.5]; nivolumab: 7.5% [RR \u003d 14.6]). Interestingly, all the vitiligo events were reported in trials investigating melanoma. The RR for developing dermatologic AEs in general, was 2.95 with pembrolizumab, and 2.3 with nivolumab.\nWe found that pembrolizumab and nivolumab are both associated with dermatologic AEs, primarily low-grade rash, pruritus, and vitiligo, which are reminiscent of those seen with ipilimumab. Knowledge of these findings is critical for optimal care, maintaining dose intensity, and health-related quality of life in cancer patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors.","title":"Characterisation and management of dermatologic adverse events to agents targeting the PD-1 receptor.","pubmedId":"27043866"}
