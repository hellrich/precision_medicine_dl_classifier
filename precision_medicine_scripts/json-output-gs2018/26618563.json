Although comparatively rare and relatively less studied, genetic abnormalities other than epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, and Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutations account for significant proportion of the driver mutations identified thus far. The targeted agents against B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF) V600E mutation, MNNG-HOS transforming gene (MET) pathway, ROS1 rearrangement, rearranged during transfection (RET) rearrangement, and HER2 pathways offer promising therapeutic options. Recruiting patients with these rarer mutations to well-designed, large multicenter trials to further validate the use of targeted agents remains a challenge. The clinical data and ongoing trials with these agents are reviewed in this article. ","title":"Emerging targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26618563"}
