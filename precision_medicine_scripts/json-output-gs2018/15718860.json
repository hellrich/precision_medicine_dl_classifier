The natural history of Barrett\u0027s esophagus is not well known, but the annual incidence of invasive adenocarcinoma is estimated to be 0.5% (reported range, 0.2%-2.0%). This represents an increased risk for esophageal cancer of 30 to 60 times higher than normal subjects. As for colorectal cancer, malignant degeneration is Barrett\u0027s esophagus is thought to occur through a continuum of histologic stages: metaplasia, dysplasia and neoplasia. Barrett\u0027s high-grade dysplasia (formerly referred to as carcinoma in situ) is the histologic stage of disease that immediately precedes the development of invasive carcinoma.\nPreviously, Barrett\u0027s high-grade dysplasia patients were routinely referred for esophageal resection surgery based upon the assumption of inevitable progression to cancer, the high rate of undiagnosed synchronous cancers, and few treatment alternatives. Important developments in Barrett\u0027s high-grade dysplasia include recent publications regarding the natural history of Barrett\u0027s high-grade dysplasia and the regulatory approval for endoscopic ablation therapy using porfimer sodium photodynamic therapy (Photofrin PDT).","title":"Present status of photodynamic therapy for high-grade dysplasia in Barrett\u0027s esophagus.","pubmedId":"15718860"}
