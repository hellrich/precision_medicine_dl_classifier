As indicated by reduction of plating efficiencies in the presence of these drugs, the intrinsic sensitivities of normal and transformed cells were similar and showed no consistent differences. Comparison of cell killing kinetics in cycling and noncycling cell populations revealed that both drugs were preferentially cytotoxic for cycling cells. This differential cytotoxicity for cycling versus noncycling cells could provide a basis for exploitation of anticalmodulin drugs in cancer chemotherapy.","title":"Selective cytotoxicity of calmidazolium and trifluoperazine for cycling versus noncycling C3H10T1/2 cells in vitro.","pubmedId":"3940184"}
