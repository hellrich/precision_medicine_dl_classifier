In addition, there was no consistent relationship between invasiveness and expression of N-cadherin and alpha-catenin in highly invasive vs minimally invasive tumours within the same histopathological grade. To assess further the relationship between cadherin expression and neural tumour invasion, we measured N-cadherin expression, calcium-dependent cell adhesion and motility of several glioblastoma cell lines. While all N-cadherin-expressing lines were adhesive, no correlation was seen between the level of N-cadherin expression and cell motility. Together, these findings imply that, in contrast to the role played by E-cadherin in carcinomas, N-cadherin does not restrict the invasion of glioblastomas.","title":"Expression of N-cadherin and alpha-catenin in astrocytomas and glioblastomas.","pubmedId":"7669572"}
