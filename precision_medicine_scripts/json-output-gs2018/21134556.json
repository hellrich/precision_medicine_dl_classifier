Current targeted therapies show promise but lack durable efficacy and tolerability. The purpose of this study was to build on previous in vitro work and evaluate withaferin A (WA), a novel RET inhibitor, in a metastatic murine model of MTC.\nA total of 5 million DRO-81-1 human MTC cells injected in the left posterior neck of nu/nu mice generated metastases uniformly to the liver, spleen, and/or lungs. Treatment with WA (8 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally, for 21 days) was started for neoplasms \u003e 100 mm(3). Endpoints were survival, neoplasm \u003e 15,00 mm(3), decreased body weight, or body score (all measured three times/wk).\nAll controls (saline; n \u003d 5) died or deteriorated from metastatic disease by 7 weeks postinjection. All treated animals were alive (WA; n \u003d 5), having tumor regression and growth delay without toxicity or weight loss at 6 weeks posttreatment (P \u003c .01). Tumor cells treated with WA demonstrated inhibition of total and phospho-RET levels by Western blot analysis in a dose-dependent manner (almost complete inhibition with treatment of 5 Î¼M WA) as well as potent inhibition of phospho-ERK and phospho-Akt levels.\nWA is a novel natural-product RET-inhibitor with efficacy in a metastatic murine model of MTC. Further long-term efficacy/toxicity studies are warranted to evaluate this compound for clinical translation.","title":"A novel RET inhibitor with potent efficacy against medullary thyroid cancer in vivo.","pubmedId":"21134556"}
