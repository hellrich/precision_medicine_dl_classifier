Because only around 20% of patients experience long-term benefit, reliable markers are needed to predict a clinical response. Therefore, we sought to determine if some myeloid cells and related inflammatory mediators could serve as predictive factors for the patients\u0027 response to ipilimumab.\nWe performed an analysis of myeloid cells in the peripheral blood of 59 stage IV melanoma patients before the treatment and at different time points upon the therapy using a clinical laboratory analysis and multicolor flow cytometry. In addition, the production of related inflammatory factors was evaluated by ELISA or Bio-Plex assays.\nAn early increase in eosinophil count during the treatment with ipilimumab was associated with an improved clinical response. In contrast, elevated amounts of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (moMDSC), neutrophils, and monocytes were found in nonresponders (n \u003d 36) as compared with basal levels and with responding patients (n \u003d 23). Moreover, in nonresponders, moMDSCs produced significantly more nitric oxide, and granulocytic MDSCs expressed higher levels of PD-L1 than these parameters at baseline and in responders, suggesting their enhanced immunosuppressive capacity. Upon the first ipilimumab infusion, nonresponders displayed elevated serum concentrations of S100A8/A9 and HMGB1 that attract and activate MDSCs.\nThese findings highlight additional mechanisms of ipilimumab effects and suggest levels of eosinophils, MDSCs, as well as related inflammatory factors S100A8/A9 and HMGB1 as novel complex predictive markers for patients who may benefit from the ipilimumab therapy.
