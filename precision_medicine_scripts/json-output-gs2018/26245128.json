The incidence of bile duct carcinoma increased for recent years. More than a century ago, some scholars have put forward the idea about the relations between C. sinensis infection and cholangiocarcinoma, and committed to research the mechanism. However, the intrinsic mechanisms involved in these processes remain obscure. It is therefore important to pay more attention to the further investigation of the relevance between C. sinensis infection and bile duct carcinoma. This review summarizes the possible mechanism of cholangiocarcinoma caused by C. sinensis, which is displayed on mechanical damage, stimulation of the worms and their excretory-secretory products (ESP), abnormity of immunoreaction and molecular genetic lesions.","title":"[Progress on the Relationship between Clonorchis sinensis Infection and Cholangiocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"26245128"}
