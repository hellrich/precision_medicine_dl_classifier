The expression of HER1, HER2, HER3 and HER4 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Association of the expression of HER family with the prognosis of patients was examined. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the survival.\nHigh expression rates of HER1, HER2, HER3 and HER4 were 46.0% (74/161), 10.6% (17/161),55.9% (90/161) and 68.3% (110/161) respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that high expression of HER3 was associated with tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, stage, neurovascular invasion, and overall 4-year survival. High expression of HER4 was associated with tumor distant metastasis and stage. High co-expression of HER2 and HER3 was associated with overall 4-year survival (P\u003d0.023). Multivariate analysis revealed that high expression of HER3 and stage were prognostic independent factors.\nUp-regulated expression of HER3 is associated with the poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients.","title":"[Clinical significance of human epidermal growth factor receptor family molecules expression in gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"23888453"}
