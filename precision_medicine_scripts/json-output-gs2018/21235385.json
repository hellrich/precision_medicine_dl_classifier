A maximally tolerated dose of 12 × 10(6) international units/m(2) after 2 weeks subcutaneously daily with dose escalation to 18 × 10(6) international units/m(2) was thus used in a phase II trial of IFN-β1a in cutaneous metastatic melanoma (n \u003d 17) and uveal melanoma (n \u003d 4). It resulted in expected but reversible drug-related severe (grade 3) adverse events in 13/21 patients; anorexia and fatigue were mostly of mild or moderate severity and infrequently needed dose reduction. Although a single patient had a sustained regression, overall IFN-β1a did not have clinical benefit (response rate \u003c10%; median progression-free survival 1.8 months). Effective and potent induction in peripheral blood cells and into serum of products of IFN-stimulated genes such as the pro-apoptotic cytokine, TRAIL, and the immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic chemokines, CXCL10 and CCL8, confirmed gene regulatory actions. To probe further anti-angiogenic mechanisms, both VEGF-A and CXCL-5 were assessed; compared to before treatment, both proteins decreased. Continued improvements in understanding of antitumor mechanisms will enhance usefulness of IFNs for nodal or distant metastases from melanoma.","title":"Gene regulatory and clinical effects of interferon β in patients with metastatic melanoma: a phase II trial.","pubmedId":"21235385"}
