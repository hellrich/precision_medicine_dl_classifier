For this purpose a sensitive ribonuclease protection assay using 33P-labelled riboprobes was established. 33P-labelled riboprobes show a high resolution and are relatively easy to handle. FGFR-1 mRNA was found to be present in the postnatal and adult adrenal gland. In the cortex high levels of FGFR-1 mRNA were detected at postnatal day (P) 1 and P8, during the third week the mRNA levels declined, and reached low levels during adulthood. PC12 cells also contained detectable amounts of FGFR-1 mRNA. With the exception of NGF, however, the different treatment procedures did not affect FGFR-1 mRNA levels. The expression pattern of the FGFR-1 transcript matches that of the expression of FGF-2 and of the mitotic activity in the developing and adult cortex. This supports the idea that FGF-2 might act as an autocrine mitogen for adrenocortical cells. In the medulla FGFR-1 mRNA levels were low at the first 3 postnatal weeks and increased towards the adult. In accordance with the developing expression pattern of FGF-2 in the medulla and in vitro effects of this protein on chromaffin and PC12 cells an autocrine/paracrine role as a maintenance and differentiation factor for chromaffin cells is conceivable.","title":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 in the adrenal gland and PC12 cells: developmental expression and regulation by extrinsic molecules.","pubmedId":"9011767"}
