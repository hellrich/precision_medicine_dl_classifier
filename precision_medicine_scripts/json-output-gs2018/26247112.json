Genetic analysis of family members showed the presence of the Val648Ile mutation in all except 1 daughter who carried the Val804Leu mutation. However, none of them showed any clinical, biochemical, or histologic signs of neoplastic disease either in the thyroid or adrenal gland. Furthermore, a daughter and the proband\u0027s sister who underwent a prophylactic thyroidectomy did not show pathologic evidence of C-cell disease.\nWe hypothesize that the combined effect of the 2 mutations may have induced the development of pheochromocytoma (PHEO) in our patient. Thus, in the presence of single RET-induced mild medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) phenotype, the search for additional genetic anomalies may lead to the discovery of rare but potentially more aggressive double mutation genotypes.","title":"A NOVEL DOUBLE MUTATION VAL648ILE AND VAL804LEU OF RET PROTO-ONCOGENE IN MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA TYPE 2.","pubmedId":"26247112"}
