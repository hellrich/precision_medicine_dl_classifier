In particular, the role of surgery at recurrence remains uncertain.\nFrom our Institutional data warehouse we analyzed 270 consecutive patients who received second surgery for recurrent glioblastoma, to assess survival after second surgery, and to evaluate prognostic factors.\nComplete resection was found in 128 (47.4%) and partial resection in 142 patients (52.6%). Median survival from second surgery was 11.4 months (95% CI: 10.0-12.7). Multivariate analysis showed that age (p \u003d 0.001), MGMT methylation (p \u003d 0.021) and extent of surgery (p \u003c 0.001) are associated with better survival.\nA complete resection should be the goal for second resection and younger age and MGMT methylation status might be considered in the selection of patients.","title":"Patient outcomes following second surgery for recurrent glioblastoma.","pubmedId":"26880307"}
