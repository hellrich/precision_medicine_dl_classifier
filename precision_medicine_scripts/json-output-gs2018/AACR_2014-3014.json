It is becoming increasingly important to identify novel therapeutic targets in GSC for anti-GBM therapies. Here, we demonstrate that hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) is hyper-expressed in GBM tumors and supports the self-renewal and tumorigenic potential of GSCs. HMMR silencing impairs GSC self-renewal and inhibits the expression of GSC markers and regulators. HMMR silencing suppresses GSC-derived tumor growth and extends the survival of mice bearing GSC xenografts. HMMR overexpression promotes GSC self-renewal and intracranial tumor propagation. In human GBM tumor specimens, HMMR expression is positively correlated with the expression of cell-stemness-associated markers and regulators. Our findings identify HMMR as a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting GSCs, suggesting therapeutic applications against GBM.","title":"Hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor maintains stemness and tumorigenic potential of glioblastoma stem cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3014"}
