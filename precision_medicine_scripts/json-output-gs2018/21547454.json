Total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, total proteins, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, autoantibodies against oxidized low-density lipoproteins-cholesterol, homocysteine (Hcy), folate, and vitamin B12 were measured in male and female controls and CKD-5D patients on hemodialysis for \u003e6 months. The CKD-5D patients had significantly lower cholesterol, LDL-c and ox-LDL levels and significantly higher ox-LDL-AB and Hcy levels versus their respective controls. The reduction in ox-LDL in CKD patients does not imply a lower risk of atherosclerosis. In fact, the risk may be higher due to a greater capture of ox-LDL by macrophage scavenger receptors, which are increased in these patients. Elevated Hcy levels may also be a risk factor for atherosclerosis in male and female CKD-5D patients.","title":"Lipid profiles and oxidative stress parameters in male and female hemodialysis patients.","pubmedId":"21547454"}
