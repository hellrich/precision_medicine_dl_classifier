Although this lymphoma is generally associated with a favorable clinical outcome, 25% of the patients die of the disease within 5 years. In this study, we developed three assays, all of which can be used with archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues: (1) a sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for various X-ALK fusion genes, (2) a 5\u0027 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) assay to identify unknown fusion partners, and (3) a real-time RT-PCR assay to quantify the amount of the NPM-ALK fusion transcript. In 26 cases of ALK(+) anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, the RT-PCR assay showed that the ALK was fused to NPM in 21 cases, to TPM3 in three, and to TFG in one. The 5\u0027 RACE assay detected ATIC-ALK fusion in the remaining case. The real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the NPM-ALK transcript was over expressed in four of 20 quantifiable cases. Patients with NPM-ALK overexpression showed a significantly unfavorable overall survival compared with those with a low expression of this transcript. The RT-PCR and 5\u0027 RACE assays developed here may be useful for identification of known and unknown gene partners fused to the ALK gene. Overexpression of the NPM-ALK fusion transcript may be associated with a poor prognosis of the patients with ALK(+) anaplastic large-cell lymphomas.","title":"Prognostic significance of NPM-ALK fusion transcript overexpression in ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"17464320"}
