Basal cell carcinoma, which probably arises from immature pluripotential cells, is the most common malignant tumor of the skin in Caucasian. It occurs mostly on sun-exposed areas such as neck and face. MATERIAL OR STUDY: We performed a retrospective study of 327 consecutive patients, diagnosed for metatypical basal cell carcinoma. Tumors were analyzed and measured from the surgeon, excision margins were marked on the basis of palpable or visual alteration of the burden. The minimum surgical margin was equal to the short axis of the ellipse. Therapy was made according to guidelines.\nA relevant difference came out between two genders. 213 Males (65%) were affected in comparison with only 114 females (35%). Concerning areas affected, first is cervico-facial area with a prevalence of 220 cases (67.3%), second trunk 33 cases (10.1%), third other areas 29 cases (8.86%), fourth limbs 32 cases (9.80%), fifth scalp with 13 cases (4%).\nDiagnosis is based on histological analysis. Histologically MTC is divided into two subtypes: intermediated and mixed. In the intermediate form transitional zones and tumor islets are found together, thus combining features of BCC and SCC In mixed subtype typical basal cells coexist with areas of conglomerated squamous cells, squamous pearls could be present.","title":"[Metatypical basal-cell carcinoma (MTC) or basosquamos carcinoma (BSC): surgical therapy].","pubmedId":"21988047"}
