We therefore elected to test this therapy in a phase III study.\nA prospective, randomized, multicenter trial to determine whether immunotherapy with a vaccine prepared from vaccinia melanoma cell lysates (VMCL) over a 2-year period after definitive surgery would improve relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IIB and III melanoma compared with a control group treated only with surgery.\nA total of 700 patients were randomized: 353 to VMCL and 347 to no immunotherapy. Seventy-seven percent had lymph node (LN) metastases and 66% had clinically detected LN metastases. Analysis on the basis of all eligible, randomized patients (n \u003d 675) found, after a median follow-up period of 8 years, a median OS of 88 months in the control versus 151 months in the treated group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 1.02; P \u003d.068 by stratified univariate Cox analysis). At 5 and 10 years, survival rates for control and treated patients were 54.8% v 60.6% and 41% v 53.4%, respectively. Median RFS was 43 months in the control group compared with 83 months in the treated group (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.07; P \u003d.17). RFS at 5 years was 50.9% for the treated group and 46.8% for the control group. There were no selective benefits from the vaccine for particular subsets of patients.\nImmunotherapy with VMCL was not associated with a statistically significant improvement in OS or RFS, with CIs not ruling out important gains from such treatment.","title":"Adjuvant immunotherapy of patients with high-risk melanoma using vaccinia viral lysates of melanoma: results of a randomized trial.","pubmedId":"12377961"}
