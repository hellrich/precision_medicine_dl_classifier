There were 12 males and 4 females with a male to female ratio of 3:1. The average age at the onset of the disease was 67 years old (range: 51 - 76). The resection rate of esophageal cancers was 100%. There was 1 case of non-radical resection. And the resection rate of lung cancer was 100%. There were radical resection (n \u003d 7) and wedge resection (n \u003d 9). The 1-year overall survival rate was 87.5%.\nLung lesions of esophageal cancer patients may be discovered by computed tomography screening of chest. More male patients than female patients are diagnosed with esophageal cancer associated with lung cancer. The operative risks and complication rates are generally acceptable.","title":"[Clinical observation of 16 patients with synchronous esophageal cancer and lung cancer treated with simultaneous esophagus and lung resection].","pubmedId":"21609645"}
