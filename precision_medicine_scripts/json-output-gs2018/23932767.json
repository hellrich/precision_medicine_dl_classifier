However, studies performed on prenatal human tissues have not been performed to evaluate the in situ characterization and topography of progenitor cells. We aimed to perform such a study using of antibodies for CD117/c-kit and multiplex antibody for Ki67+ caspase 3. Antibodies were applied on samples dissected from five human midterm fetuses. Positive CD117/c-kit labeling was found in mesenchymal derived tissues, such as the dental follicle and the dental papilla. The epithelial tissues, that is, dental lamina, enamel organ and oral epithelia, also displayed isolated progenitor cells which were CD117/c-kit positive. Interestingly, CD117/c-kit positive cells of mesenchymal derived tissues extended multiple prolongations building networks; the most consistent of such networks were those of the dental follicle and the perivascular networks of the dental papilla. However, the mantle of the dental papilla was also positive for CD117/c-kit positive stromal networks. The CD117/c-kit cell populations building networks appeared mostly with a Ki67 negative phenotype. The results suggest that CD117/c-kit progenitor cells of the prenatal tooth germ tissues might be involved in intercellular signaling.","title":"c-kit positive cells and networks in tooth germs of human midterm fetuses.","pubmedId":"23932767"}
