That is why central nervous system glioblastoma is quite a challenging neoplasm, requiring much further research to understand the molecular and cellular clinical basis. Existing in vivo glioblastoma models are based on the inoculation of glioma cells into rodent brains or the use of transgenic mice. For decades the avian model was the model of choice in developmental biology. However, the reports on chorioallantoic membrane glioblastoma model are quite rare. The objective of these experiments was to evaluate morphological issues of glioblastoma on CAM and the interaction between transplant and CAM. Chicken embryos obtained from a local poultry farm were put in an incubator. Fresh samples of glioblastoma obtained during the operation were grafted on CAM, which is formed on the 7-9 th day of embryo development. The growth and morphological issues of cells were observed with a stereo microscope and the histological preparations were done in particular intervals of time, starting from 24 hours after the transplantation. We observed peritumoral edema, necrotic zones and angiogenesis on the chorioallantoic membrane. This evidence, together with the immunohistological proof, shows that glioblastoma survives on CAM and has its typical morphological features.","title":"Evaluation of morphological issues of central nervous system glioblastoma on chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane.","pubmedId":"17937190"}
