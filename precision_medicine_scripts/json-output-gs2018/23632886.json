DNMT3A(mut) were found in 20.9% of AMLs and were associated with older age (P \u003c .0001), higher white blood cell counts (P \u003c .0001), cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML; P \u003c .0001), NPM1 mutations (P \u003c .0001), FLT3 internal tandem duplications (P \u003c .0001), and IDH1/2 mutations (P \u003c .0001). In univariable and multivariable analyses, DNMT3A(mut) did not impact event-free, relapse-free (RFS), or overall survival (OS) in either the entire cohort or in CN-AML; a negative prognostic effect was found only in the ELN unfavorable CN-AML subset (OS, P \u003d .011). In addition, R882 mutations vs non-R882 mutations showed opposite clinical effects-unfavorable for R882 on RFS (all: hazard ratio [HR], 1.29 [P \u003d .026]; CN-AML: HR, 1.38 [P \u003d .018]) and favorable for non-R882 on OS (all: HR, 0.77 [P \u003d .057]; CN-AML: HR, 0.73 [P \u003d .083]). In our statistically high-powered study with minimized selection bias, DNMT3A(mut) represent a frequent genetic lesion in younger adults with AML but have no significant impact on survival end points; only moderate effects on outcome were found, depending on molecular subgroup and DNMT3A(mut) type.","title":"Clinical impact of DNMT3A mutations in younger adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia: results of the AML Study Group (AMLSG).","pubmedId":"23632886"}
