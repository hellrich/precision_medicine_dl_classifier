Although no clinical response was seen when cells were administered alone, an objective clinical response to therapy was seen with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes administered together with a highly immunogenic fowlpox vaccine expressing a gp100: 209-217 (210M) epitope. Persistence of the transferred antigen-specific lymphocytes in the peripheral blood was observed only after adoptive cell therapy plus administration of vaccine. Cell proliferation in vitro was further stimulated by additional vaccine and interleukin-2. The patient has an ongoing partial response at 10 months after the last treatment.","title":"Impact of a recombinant fowlpox vaccine on the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a patient with metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"19752747"}
