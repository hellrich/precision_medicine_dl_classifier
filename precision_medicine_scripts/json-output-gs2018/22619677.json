Depending on the tumour type, genetic alterations resulting in the functional inactivation have frequently been reported in both genes. By contrast, much less is known regarding the overexpression of these proteins in the tumor cells. In this study, expressions of p16(INK4) RB1, and CDKN2A copy number variances (CNV) in the tumor cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively, in 73 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with known 5-year survivals. The histologic type (P \u003d 0.01), p16(INK4) (P \u003d 0.004), and RB1 (P \u003c 0.001) were predictive of survivals. The CDKN2A CNV (P \u003c 0.05) was also significant when compared to those cases without CNV. Therefore, among the molecular genetic prognostic factors, expressions of RB1 and p16(INK4) in the tumor cells were the most strongly predictive of adverse outcomes in stage I and II nonsquamous NSCLC.","title":"Altered p16(INK4) and RB1 Expressions Are Associated with Poor Prognosis in Patients with Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer.","pubmedId":"22619677"}
