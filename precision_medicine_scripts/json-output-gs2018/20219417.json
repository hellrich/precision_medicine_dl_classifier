Recently, the data showed that Slug, a transcription factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT), is a molecular target that contributes to the biological specificity of c-kit signaling pathway. In this study, the expression of c-kit and Slug was evaluated in two ACC cell lines and 121 patients with ACC. The results of real-time RT-PCR and Western blot showed that ACC-2 and ACC-M cell lines expressed c-kit and Slug mRNA and protein. The immunohistochemical assay in patients demonstrated that positive expression of c-kit and Slug was observed in 108/121 (89.26%) and 87/121 (71.90%) of cases, respectively, and that c-kit and Slug expression was significantly associated with tumor site, TNM stage, histological pattern, perineural invasion, local regional recurrence and distant metastasis of patients with ACC (P\u003c0.05). Furthermore, there was a significant association between the positive expression of c-kit and that of Slug (P\u003d0.046). These findings indicated that c-kit/Slug pathway might participate in the invasion and metastasis of salivary ACC.","title":"Expression of c-kit and Slug correlates with invasion and metastasis of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20219417"}
