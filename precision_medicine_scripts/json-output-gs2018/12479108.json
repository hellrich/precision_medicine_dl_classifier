This study was designed to investigate the distributive regularity of EGFR, IL-6R, PCNA, DI and the diploid in the gastric cancer patients with recurrence and metastasis, to provide reliable basis to judge whether it has metastasis before operation and recurrence post operation.\nImmunohistochemistry SP method and image analyzer (Fegulgen staining) were used to test the EGFR, IL-6R, PCNA, DI and the diploid in 199 patients with gastric cancer, 20 cases with normal gastric mucous membrane, and 20 cases of atypical hyperplasia.\nThe level of expression of EGFR was higher in the patients with metastasis and residual gastric cancer(61.11%, 66%, 66.67%) than in the patients with other cancers, normal gastric mucous membrane, atypical hyperplasia(47.83%, 0%, 35%) (P \u003c 0.01); In the distribution form of DNA diploid, the rate of non-diploid cells was remarkably higher in the patients with metastasis and residual gastric cancer(56.9 +/- 13.3% vs 12.8 +/- 6.3%, 0%, 12.2), and so is the DNA index (2.91 +/- 0.33 vs 2.17 +/- 0.29), but the rate of 2C cells is lower(43.8 +/- 12.9 vs 10.2 +/- 7.5, P \u003c 0.01).\nEGFR, DI, and the diploid are valuable targets for judging metastasis and recurrence of gastric cancer before and after operation.","title":"[Relationship between recurrence and metastasis of gastric cancer and expression of EGFR, IL-6R, PCNA, and DI].","pubmedId":"12479108"}
