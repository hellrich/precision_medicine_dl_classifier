Up to 2011 no systemic therapy had been able to achieve a prolongation of overall survival in controlled randomized trials. Cytotoxic chemotherapy resulted in objective remission in only a small subgroup of patients. The growing insight into the molecular pathology and the discovery of frequent mutations made it possible to define melanoma subgroups suitable for targeted therapies. In approximately 50% of melanomas activating mutations of the BRAF gene were identified and can be treated with specific inhibitors. Further mutations which can be approached by targeted therapies are found on the c-Kit and NRAS genes. Another promising approach is immunotherapy aimed to activate cytotoxic T cells. A monoclonal antibody directed against CTLA-4 was approved after convincing results in clinical trials and antibodies against PD-1 or PD-L1 are currently under clinical investigation. Through these achievements life prolonging therapies are available for melanoma patients for the first time.","title":"[Personalized therapy concepts for malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"23371260"}
