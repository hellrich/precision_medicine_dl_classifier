In the present study, we examined our institutional experience with patients having nonmetastatic HER2-positive (HER(+)) breast cancer and hypothesized that those patients who received VD supplementation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy would have improved long-term outcomes.\nWe performed a retrospective review of all patients (n \u003d 308) given trastuzumab-based chemotherapy between 2006 and 2012 at the University of Miami/Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (UM/SCCC). We identified 2 groups of patients for comparison-those who received VD supplementation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n \u003d 134) and those who did not (n \u003d 112). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were fitted to overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).\nMore than half of the patients received VD during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (54.5%), with 60% receiving a dose \u003c 10,000 units/wk and 33.3% having a VD deficiency at the start of therapy. In our final multivariate model, VD use was associated with improved DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.88; P \u003d .026], whereas larger tumor size was associated with worse DFS (HR, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.06-11.66; P \u003d .04). There were no differences in OS based on any of the categories, including VD use, tumor size, number of metastatic lymph nodes, age at diagnosis, or lymphovascular invasion (LVI).\nVD supplementation in patients with nonmetastatic HER2(+) breast cancer is associated with improved DFS.","title":"Improved clinical outcomes associated with vitamin D supplementation during adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HER2+ nonmetastatic breast cancer.","pubmedId":"25241299"}
