However, the prevalence of HER2 positivity in CRC patients and its correlation with clinicopathologic features are not clear. Methods: HER2 expression was tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 4,913 consecutive patients with CRC treated with surgical resection of primary tumor during 2011-2014 in our institution. The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of the primary tumors were used. Dual color silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (DISH) was performed in all IHC 3+/2+ cases and randomly selected IHC 1+/0 cases subsequently. The scoring criteria of HER2 status in gastric cancer was used. Results: HER2 positivity was found in 160 (3.3%) out of 4,913 cases of CRC. Among them, 68 cases were IHC 3+, while 92 cases were IHC 2+ and DISH+. 157 cases (3.2%) were HER2 amplified determined by DISH, including 66 (97.1%, 66/68) IHC 3+ and 92 (35.6%, 92/258) IHC 2+ cases. None of the 50 cases of IHC 1+/0 was HER2 amplified. HER2 positivity was correlated with perineural invasion, vascular invasion, lymph node metastases, and higher TNM stage. HER2 positivity was more common in younger patients ( \u003c 60 year old). Only one HER2 positive case had mismatch repair protein (MMR) deficiency. HER2 positivity was found not related to tumor location. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest study of HER2 status in Asian patients with CRC. HER2 overexpression or amplification of tumor cells occurred in a small number of patients with CRC. HER2 positivity was related to unfavorable prognostic factors, more common in younger patients and rare in MMR deficiency cases. The further study of molecular heterogeneity of HER2 expression or amplification in patients with CRC was ongoing.","title":"HER2 overexpression and amplification in patients with colorectal cancer: a large-scale retrospective study in Chinese population.","pubmedId":"ASCO_187522-199"}
