Phase I/IIa data has provided evidence of a favourable safety profile, and durable responses in both cutaneous and uveal melanoma have been observed. To complement the clinical studies we have developed a comprehensive biomarker strategy to aid our understanding of pharmacodynamics, patient response and potential mechanisms of resistance which includes analysis of markers in both the tumour and periphery. The data obtained to date provide evidence of the pharmacodynamic effects of the molecule including chemokine/cytokine release, in both the tumor and periphery, and lymphocyte infiltration into tumors. In addition, changes in the levels of certain chemokines following the first dose of IMCgp100 were associated with tumor shrinkage. The biomarker strategy we have developed forms the basis for the support of the on-going Ph II development of IMCgp100 in both cutaneous and uveal melanoma and for other ImmTAC molecules, as single agents and in combination, for the treatment of solid tumours.","title":"Biomarker strategy to guide the clinical development of ImmTACTM molecules, a novel class of bispecific T cell engaging biologic drugs.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-3655"}
