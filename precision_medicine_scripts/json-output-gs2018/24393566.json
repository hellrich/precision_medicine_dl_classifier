However, it appears that amelanotic melanomas frequently lack BRAF mutations.\nTo report the genetical analysis of one case amelanotic melanoma developing oral metastasis.\nThe BRAF mutational status of the primary lesion was assessed by both Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing.\nBoth methodologies showed changes in three nucleotides: C1796T; G1798A and T1799A. These mutations should result in a rare double aminoacid substitution in codons 599 and 600 of the BRAF protein (BRAF T599I/V600K).\nThis unusual mutation was associated with an uncommon clinical phenotype of the primary tumour and with an unusual site of metastatic spread. In the lack of comparable data, a potential association between the unusual mutation and clinical findings remains a matter of further studies.","title":"A novel BRAF mutation in association with primary amelanotic melanoma with oral metastases.","pubmedId":"24393566"}
