We evaluated the clinical relevance of TF expression in melanocytic tumors and TF serum level in patients with malignant melanoma. TF expression in benign and malignant melanocytic lesions was examined by immunoperoxidase staining in 20 nevi, 41 primary, and 24 metastatic melanoma lesions. TF was detected in 94, 95, and 100% of these lesions, respectively. The staining pattern was membranous and cytoplasmic both in nevi and melanoma cells. This finding was confirmed by western blot analysis using cultured human melanocytes, nevi cells, and melanoma cell lines. TF was also expressed on blood vessels in benign and malignant melanocytic lesions. Expression of TF in primary melanoma lesions was not associated with any clinicopathological variables. In addition, the serum level of TF was elevated in 14% of patients with melanoma; however, it was not correlated with disease progression. These results suggest that TF was ubiquitously expressed in melanocytic cells and its expression was not correlated with disease progression and/or metastatic potency of melanoma cells.","title":"Tissue factor expression and serum level in patients with melanoma does not correlate with disease progression.","pubmedId":"11434567"}
