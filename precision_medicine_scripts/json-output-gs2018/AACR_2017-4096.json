Unfortunately, even though the intrinsic EGFR-TKI resistant patients harboring the EGFR-sensitizing mutation, a part of those are still resistant to EGFR-TKI. And, it has been reported that both PTEN loss and NF-kB activation contribute to intrinsic EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer. Transglutaminse 2 (TG2) is post-translational modification enzyme and known to induce degradation of tumor suppressors including PTEN and IκB-α with peptide cross-linking activity. Because TG2 was known as a regulator of PTEN and IκB-α (NF-κB inhibitor) level in cytosol, we have explored if TG2 can be another key regulator to the intrinsic resistance of EGFR-TKI in the intrinsic EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC cell. In NSCLC with EGFR-sensitive mutations, we first found that higher TG2 expression level and lower PTEN and IκB-α expression levels in the intrinsic EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC compare with EGFR-TKI sensitive NSCLC. TG2 stably expressing EGFR-TKI sensitive NSCLC cells harboring EGFR mutations showed reduction of both PTEN and IκB-α and exhibited EGFR-TKI resistance. In reverse, TG2 stably downregulated H1650, intrinsic EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC cell harboring EGFR sensitive mutation, restored EGFR-TKI sensitivity via PTEN and IκB-α restoration by TG2 loss. Xenograft study using TG2 overexpressed and downregulated NSCLC cells also verified our in vitro results. Therefore, we have demonstrated that TG2 elicits the intrinsic EGFR-TKI resistance via PTEN loss and activation of NF-κB pathway. These results suggest that TG2 may be a useful target for overcoming the intrinsic EGFR-TKI resistance of NSCLC harboring EGFR sensitive mutations.","title":"Transglutaminase 2(TG2) induces the intrinsic EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-4096"}
