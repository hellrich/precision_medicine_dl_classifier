Most of the cases are of T-cell line with a loss of cell surface receptors but with a production of cytotoxic cytoplasmatic granules--immunohistochemically (IHC) positive perforin, granzyme B, and TIA-1. The diagnostics of ALCL is based on morphological findings and results of IHC, which further stratify ALCLs to basic immunophenotypes according to ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) protein expression--ALCL CD30+ ALK+ and ALCL CD30+ ALK+. The morphological investigations are supplemented by karyotyping and/or by a demonstration of breakpoint at 2p23 harboring ALK gene (FISH), and by molecular detection of chimeric genes characteristic of ALK+ lymphomas (NPM-ALK, ATIC-ALK, TPM3-ALK, TFG-ALK, and some even rarer rearrangements). Molecular diagnostics is important in monitoring minimal residual disease. As some of the characteristic molecular changes were demonstrated in healthy individuals and in Hodgkin\u0027s disease by quantitative PCR, the validation of these findings demands further studies. ALK protein positive ALCLs affect patients in age categories up to the third decade, whereas ALK protein negative cases occur in older patients with an average age of 60 years. Both subgroups of lymphomas are aggressive but ALK+ lymphomas react well to systemic treatment, and have a more favorable prognosis. Primary skin ALCLs belong to a group of T-cell lymphoproliferative diseases of the skin and have, in the majority of cases, a favorable course without generalization.","title":"[Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma: review].","pubmedId":"14631806"}
