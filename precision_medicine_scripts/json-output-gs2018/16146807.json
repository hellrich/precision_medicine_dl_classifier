We observed cytoplasmic and/or nuclear expression of p-Akt in 22 (54%) of 41 benign nevi, 112 (71.3%) of 157 primary tumors, and 50 (71%) of 70 metastases. Cytoplasmic PTEN staining was observed in 0 (0%), 152 (87.7%), and 64 (90%) of 41 nevi, 162 primary tumors, and 71 metastases, respectively. A significant positive correlation was seen between PTEN and p-Akt cytoplasmic expression (P \u003c .001) in primary melanomas. Cytoplasmic p-Akt expression showed a positive association with cyclin A in superficial spreading (P \u003d .038) but not in nodular (P \u003d .22) melanomas. Cytoplasmic p-Akt and PTEN expression did not have an impact on disease-free and overall survival, but complete lack of nuclear p-Akt expression was a predictor of shorter disease-free survival (P \u003d .025) for patients with superficial spreading melanoma.","title":"Expression of activated Akt and PTEN in malignant melanomas: relationship with clinical outcome.","pubmedId":"16146807"}
