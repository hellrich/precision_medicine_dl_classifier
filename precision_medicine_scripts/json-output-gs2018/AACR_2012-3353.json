Intriguingly, our lab has recently shown that Nodal, a TGF-beta family member, is in fact secreted by melanoma and breast cancer cells and that Nodal expression positively correlates with tumor grade in human patient samples. Our current studies demonstrate a positive role for Nodal in regulating breast cancer cell renewal and aggressiveness. Specifically, short hairpin (shRNA) knockdown of Nodal expression in human breast cancer cell lines diminishes proliferation, invasion and clonogenicity of these cell lines in vitro and dramatically curtails tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model. Additionally, our data suggest that these effects may be caused, in part, by alterations in the expression of adhesion receptors known to function in tumor engraftment and metastasis. Taken together, our data suggest that Nodal signaling may facilitate the acquisition of self-renewal and migratory capabilities in breast cancer cells and represent a novel therapeutic target for disrupting these processes in breast cancer cells.","title":"Nodal signaling mediates the aggressive, tumorigenic phenotype in breast cancer cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-3353"}
