Despite the advancement in treatment procedures the overall survival rate of patients has not considerably enhanced in the past few decades. Therefore, new strategies to achieve a favorable response for the improvement in the prognosis of HNSCC are urgently needed. In this study we examined the immune modulatory activity of bitter melon extract (BME) in HNSCC tumor microenvironment. For this, mouse head and neck cancer (SCCVII) cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of C3H mice. BME was fed orally, and tumor growth was evaluated. We observed that BME treatment significantly inhibits the tumor growth in BME fed mice as compared to control group. Flow cytometry data showed that BME treatment not only decreases the infiltrating T regulatory (Treg) cells in the tumor but also in splenocytes. Additionally, BME treatment reduces Th17 cell population in the tumor and augments in the spleen. However, BME treatment did not alter Th1 and Th2 populations. Further study suggested that BME inhibits cell proliferation as evident from low expression of PCNA and c-Myc in the tumors of BME fed mice as compared to that of control group. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing BME exerts immunomodulatory effect in regressing HNSCC tumor growth in preclinical model.","title":"Immunomodulatory activity of bitter melon extract in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-5125"}
