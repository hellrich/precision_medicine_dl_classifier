During the procedure, a small perforation of the thoracic part of the distal esophagus occurred. Since the rupture was small, well-confined, and detected immediately, the lesion was closed using endoscopically applied metallic clips. The patient did very well, and a contrast swallow three days later showed no leakage of the esophagus. This procedure has not yet been described for the esophagus in the literature, but it may be considered in selected cases of small and well-defined instrumental perforations.","title":"Endoscopic clipping of esophageal perforation after pneumatic dilation for achalasia.","pubmedId":"8608757"}
