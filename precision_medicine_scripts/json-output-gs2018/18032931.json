In vitro studies with cellular models of human thyroid carcinoma cells demonstrated that the adoptive expression of oncogenic RET/PTC1, Ha-RASV12 or BRAFV600E enhances Skp2 and reduces p27 protein expression in a MAP kinase-dependent manner; that RAS/BRAF/MAP kinase-dependent control of p27 expression in thyroid cancer cells occurs by regulating the stability of Skp2 and p27 protein; and that antisense oligonucleotides to p27 suppress growth arrest induced by MEK inhibitors. Finally, analysis of human thyroid carcinomas indicated that MAP kinase-positive thyroid tumors-as detected by immunostaining for p-ERK - presented high p27 degradative activity and low levels of p27 protein (n \u003d 30; p \u003c 0.05). In summary, our results indicate that constitutive signalling of the MAP kinase cascade contributes to the development of thyroid cancer promoted by activated RAS and BRAF oncogenes and that this occurs, at least in part, by compromising the inhibitory function of p27.","title":"Loss of p27 expression through RAS--\u003eBRAF--\u003eMAP kinase-dependent pathway in human thyroid carcinomas.","pubmedId":"18032931"}
