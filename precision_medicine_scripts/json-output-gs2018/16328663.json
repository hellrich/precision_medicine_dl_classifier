Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare diagnosis in childhood and reported multiple lesions are generally seen in the context of familial disease, occasionally with syndromic associations. Although there are no reports of genetic mutation in cases of pediatric GIST, very many cases of multiple GISTs investigated on a molecular level have shown germline KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha mutation; these were familial cases. Despite the negative family history in our patient, the multiplicity of lesions in such a young patient raised concern for a genetic predisposition and prompted extensive molecular workup. Repeat evaluation of distinct aliquots of tumor tissue by polymerase chain amplification followed by sequence analysis of selected coding sequences of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha previously shown to harbor mutations in GIST, yielded no evidence of even a somatic mutation. This clinically unique case is discussed in the context of a literature review.","title":"Multiple gastric stromal tumors in a child without syndromic association lacks common KIT or PDGFRalpha mutations.","pubmedId":"16328663"}
