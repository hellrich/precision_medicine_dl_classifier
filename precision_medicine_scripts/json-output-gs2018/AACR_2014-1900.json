Prognostic significance was estimated by event-free survival (EFS) with median of follow-up time 28 months (range 1-166 months).MLPA revealed MNA in 19 patients (17.6%), in 12 cases (11.1%) NAG, DDX1 or ALK genes were coamplified with MYCN. EFS in case of MNA was significantly low comparing with normal MYCN status (0.200.11 vs. 0.690.06, p\u003c0.001). 2p23-24 gain was observed in 15 patients (13.9%) and showed prognostic significance in patients under 1 year (EFS 0.530.25 vs. 0.960.04, p\u003d0.047). In 29 patients (26.9%) 1p deletion was revealed. It had prognostic impact in the whole group (EFS 0.330.10 vs. 0.670.06, p\u003d0.002) and in MYCN non-amplified patients (EFS 0.400.14 vs. 0.710.06, p\u003d0.029). 17q gain was detected in 54 patients (50.0%) and led to decreased EFS in all patients (0.420.08 vs. 0.710.07, p\u003c0.001) as well as in MYCN-negative subgroup (0.470.10 vs. 0.770.07, p\u003d0.002). 4p gain detected in 8 patients (8.0%) dramatically decreased EFS in patients under 1 year of age (0.00 vs. 0.880.06, p\u003d0.055). Gain of short and long arms of chromosome 7 detected in 6 patients (6.0%) led to reduced EFS in the whole group (0.330.19 vs. 0.560.06, p\u003d0.053) and in MYCN non-amplified patients: 0.400.22 vs. 0.640.06, p\u003d0.044.In 8 patients (8.0%) 9p deletion was found. Presence of this aberration resulted in vivid decreasing of EFS in both all evaluated patients (0.00 vs. 0.600.06, p\u003d0.035) and MYCN non-amplified group (0.00 vs. 0.680.06, p\u003d0.047). 3p deletion observed in 30 of 108 patients (27.8%) had adverse prognostic significance in the group of patients above 3 years of age (EFS 0.250.23 vs. 0.710.11, p\u003d0.034).Neither interstitial (n\u003d16, 14.8%) nor terminal (n\u003d9, 8.3%) 11q deletions had prognostic significance in our series: EFS 0.280.14 and 0.780.14 vs. 0.600.06, p\u003d0.164 and p\u003d0.477 respectively. No influence on EFS was found in case of presence 12q or MDM2 gene gain (n\u003d 20, 20.0%) and 14q aberrations (n\u003d14, 14.0%).Thus, MLPA is accurate technique for CNV detection in neuroblastoma. In our cohort of patients, treated according GPOH NB2004 protocol, MNA, 1p, 9p deletions and 17q gain demonstrated negative influence on EFS. Presence of 2p23-24 gain and 4p gain led to decrease EFS in the group of patients below 1 year old, while 1p and 9p deletions, 17q gain and gain of both arms of chromosome 7 retained prognostic significance in MYCN non-amplified patients. Coamplification of MYCN gene with DDX1, NAG and ALK genes had no prognostic significance comparing with amplification of MYCN gene alone.","title":"Prognostic significance of genetic aberrations in neuroblastoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1900"}
