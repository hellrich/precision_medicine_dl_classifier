While data suggest that the EML4-ALK/MET/ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib is highly effective in these patients, few data is available about the prognostic impact, the predictive value for different treatments, and the genetic heterogeneity of ROS1-positive patients.   Methods:    1137 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung were analyzed regarding their ROS1 status. In positive cases, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed. Clinical characteristics, treatments and outcome were assessed. Overall survival (OS) was compared with genetically defined subgroups of ROS1-negative patients.   Results: ROS1 status was analyzed in 1035 (91.0%) patients, whereof 19 (1.8%) had ROS1-rearrangement. The median OS of the patients has not been reached yet. Stage IV patients with ROS1-rearrangement had the best OS of all analyzed subgroups (36.7 months, p \u003c 0.001). 9 of 14 (64.2%) patients had at least one response under chemotherapy. Pemetrexed-containing regimens showed higher response rates than paclitaxel-containing ones (80% vs 17%). Estimated mean OS for patients receiving chemotherapy and crizotinib was 5.3 years (median not reached). Ten patients with ROS1-rearrangement (52.6%) harbored additional genetic aberrations in BRAF, MET, EGFR, MAP2K1, and TP53.   Conclusions: ROS1-rearangement is not only a strong predictive marker for response to crizotinib, but also seems to be the best prognostic molecular marker in NSCLC reported so far. In stage IV ROS1-positive patients, response to chemotherapy was remarkable high and overall survival regardless of systemic therapy significantly better compared to other genetically defined subgroups including EGFR-mutated and ALK-fusion-positive NSCLC.","title":"ROS1 rearrangement in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Prognostic and predicitve impact and genetic variability.","pubmedId":"ASCO_151873-156"}
