Previous studies have shown a downregulation in cAMP signaling in mutant NRAS melanoma. However, no relationship has been reported about cAMP signaling in mutant BRAF melanoma, which makes up about 60% of all cutaneous melanoma. Here, we studied the role of four main G-protein signaling pathways using reporters for Gs (cAMP Response Element, CRE), Gq (inositol triphosphate signaling, NFAT-RE), G12 (RhoA signaling, SRF-RE) and G (MAPK pathway, SRE), in melanoma. Our data show that cAMP signaling is substantially more constitutively active in BRAFV600E mutant melanoma than NRAS mutant melanoma. Moreover, hyperactivation of cAMP signaling decreases proliferation and migration in BRAFV600E. Interestingly, in a melanoma cell line with neither BRAF nor NRAS mutation, cAMP hyperactivation increased proliferation. Furthermore, BRAFV600E inhibition increases constitutive cAMP activity. These results show a possible crosstalk between cAMP signaling and BRAFV600E in melanoma.","title":"cAMP signaling in BRAFV600E melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4198"}
