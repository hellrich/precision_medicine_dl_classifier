Herein, we describe a single case of a 70 year-old male with sinonasal mucosal melanoma, exhibiting varying histologic phenotypes including small round blue cell morphology, epithelioid and focal rhabdoid morphology and strong, diffuse desmin immunoreactivity. These constellation of features initially prompted the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. The differential diagnosis in this anatomic area includes other malignant small round blue cell tumors of the sinonasal mucosa such as rhabdomyosarcoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, and lymphoma. We reviewed precedent literature and further discuss the potential pitfalls to which pathologists may be prone.","title":"Primary sinonasal mucosal melanoma with aberrant diffuse and strong desmin reactivity: a potential diagnostic pitfall!","pubmedId":"24974197"}
