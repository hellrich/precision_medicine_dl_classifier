Most tumor cells use glycolysis even under aerobic conditions (the Warburg effect). This altered metabolism is a possible therapeutic target. The novel lipoate derivative CPI-613 is a first-in-class agent that targets a key mitochondrial enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH).  Methods:  CPI-613 was tested against leukemia cell lines in vitro and  in vivo. It is also the subject of a phase I clinical trial for patients with hematologic malignancies.  Results:  CPI-613 was active against HL60, Jurkat, and K562 cells, with an average IC50 value of 14 M (range 12.2  16.4). CPI-613 was synergistic with doxorubicin, with Combinatorial Index (CI) values of 0.478 to 0.765. CPI-613 sensitivity increased with knockdown of p53 or MN1 expression, despite their increased resistance to standard therapy. CPI-613 was synergistic with nilotinib against BCR-ABL-expressing cells and with sorafenib against Flt3 ITD-expressing cells. CI values for nilotinib + CPI was 0.059 (+/-0.002) and for sorafenib + CPI was 0.581 (+/-0.052). In vivo, CPI-613 synergized with doxorubicin; median survival improved from 12 days with doxorubicin to 16 days with CPI-613 plus doxorubicin (p\u003d0.0001). In the phase I clinical trial, 7 of 13 evaluable patients had a response of stable disease or better, for an overall response rate of 54% (see table). CPI-613 was well tolerated, with no evidence of marrow suppression and no dose limiting toxicity identified.  Conclusions:  The novel agent CPI-613 has activity against a variety of hematological malignancies, including acute leukemias. The therapeutic index appears high, with only minor toxicities observed.Patient #DiagnosisDose CPI-613 mg/m2Best response# of cycles1NHL420NE02AML420PD13Myeloma840PD14AML840, 1386, 2100CR155Hodgkin\u0027s840PD16AML1386PD07Myeloma1386SD38Myeloma1386SD49AML1386PD110MDS2100SD711MDS2100SD612AML2100MLFS213AML2940NE014Burkitt\u0027s2940SD415AML2940PD1SD\u003d stable disease; CR\u003dcomplete remission; MLFS\u003dmorphologically leukemia-free state; PD\u003dprogressive disease; NE\u003dnot evaluable.","title":"Evaluation of the first-in-class antimitochondrial metabolism agent CPI-613 in hematologic malignancies.","pubmedId":"ASCO_94301-114"}
