Kaplan-Meier estimates (with 95% confidence intervals) of cumulative recurrence rates of all tumors at 2 and 5 years were 1.9% (1%-2.7%) and 5.0% (3.2%-6.7%), respectively; of BCC at 2 and 5 years were 2% (0.8%-3.3%) and 4.2% (1.9%-6.4%), respectively; and of all SCC at 2 and 5 years were 1.8% (0.8%-2.8%) and 5.8% (2.9%-8.7%), respectively. Tumors on male patients and those with a diameter greater than 2 cm were associated with a statistically significant increase in recurrence likelihood.\nThis study represents only patients treated in 1 dermatology office in North Florida and may not be representative of the general patient population.\nSuperficial x-ray therapy remains a viable nonsurgical option for the treatment of primary BCC and SCC in patients where surgical intervention is declined, unadvisable, or potentially associated with significant cosmetic or functional limitations.","title":"Superficial x-ray in the treatment of basal and squamous cell carcinomas: a viable option in select patients.","pubmedId":"22818756"}
