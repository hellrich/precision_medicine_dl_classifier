FISH+ status for each gene was significantly associated with smoking history, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) histology, and increased copy number of the other studied genes. Multivariate analysis of overall survival indicated increased SOX2 gene copy number (P \u003d 0.008), stage I-II (P\u003c0.001), and adenocarcinoma or SCC histology (P \u003d 0.016) as independent, favorable prognostic factors. A statistically significant interaction was observed between stage and SOX2 gene status (P \u003d 0.021), indicating that the prognostic impact of SOX2 gene gain differs across stages and is limited to patients with stage I-II disease (HR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.25-0.77; P \u003d 0.004, adjusted for histology).\nIncreased SOX2 gene copy number is an independent and favorable prognostic factor in surgically resected, early stage NSCLC, regardless of histology. SOX2, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and BRF2 gene gains are likely to occur concurrently, with potentially relevant implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies.","title":"Increased SOX2 gene copy number is associated with FGFR1 and PIK3CA gene gain in non-small cell lung cancer and predicts improved survival in early stage disease.","pubmedId":"24736592"}
