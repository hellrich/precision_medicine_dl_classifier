Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation (9;22) that generates the Bcr-Abl fusion gene. The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated by Bcr-Abl chimera protein and mediates the leukemogenesis in CML. However, the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl activates the PI3K/Akt pathway is not completely understood. In the present study, we found that pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatases 1 and 2 (PHLPP1 and PHLPP2) were depleted in CML cells. We investigated the interaction between PHLPPs and Bcr-Abl in CML cell lines and Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cells from CML patients. The Abl kinase inhibitors and depletion of Bcr-Abl induced the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, which dephosphorylated Ser-473 on Akt1, -2, and -3, resulting in inhibited proliferation of CML cells. The reduction of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 expression by short interfering RNA in CML cells weakened the Abl kinase inhibitor-mediated inhibition of proliferation. In colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte; colony-forming unit-granulocyte, macrophage; and burst-forming unit-erythroid, treatment with the Abl kinase inhibitors and depletion of Bcr-Abl induced PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 expression and inhibited colony formation of Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cells, whereas depletion of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 weakened the inhibition of colony formation activity by the Abl kinase inhibitors in Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cells. Thus, Bcr-Abl represses the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 and continuously activates Akt1, -2, and -3 via phosphorylation on Ser-473, resulting in the proliferation of CML cells.","title":"Depletion of Pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatases 1 and 2 by Bcr-Abl promotes chronic myelogenous leukemia cell proliferation through continuous phosphorylation of Akt isoforms.","pubmedId":"19261608"}
