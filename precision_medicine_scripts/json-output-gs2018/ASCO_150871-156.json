Germline mutations in APC  are responsible for the autosomal dominant familial adenomatous polyposis, while somatic mutations are are linked to the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Haploinsufficiency of APC impairs hematopoiesis in animal models suggesting that loss of APC function contributes to the development of myelodysplasia (Wang J,et al. Blood 2010); however, patients (Pts) with germline APC mutations are not predisposed to develop myeloid malignancies. It is not known whether somatic mutations in APC gene can drive leukemogenesis.  Methods:  We screened our genomic database for the presence of somatic mutations in APC genes in pts with myeloid malignancies. A panel of 62 gene mutations obtained by NG targeted deep sequencing was included. Variant allele frequencies adjusted by zygosity were used to define clonal architecture.  Results:  Among 886 pts with myeloid malignancies, 15 (2%) had somatic mutations in APC. Of these, 8 had MDS, 4 AML, and 3 MDS/MPN; with median age of 69 years (range 39-84); none had a documented family history or personal history of CRC. In metaphase cytogenetic (MC) analyses, 11 pts had normal karyotype, 2 del(7q), 1 (-7), 1 inv(1q), and none had chr 5 abnormalities by either MC or SNP. Mutations in APC included: 8 missense, 3 nonesense, and 4 non-frameshift in/dels. Majority of APC mutations showed heterozygous configuration, resulting in the same consequences with hemizygous deletion of the locus. We then compared these mutations to germline variants recorded in the GEO database. No variants matched our data. Clonal architecture analysis showed that APC mutations can be either founder or subclonal. In founder cases, APC mutations were always accompanied by subclonal mutations described in myeloid malignancies e.g. SF3B1, TET2, DNMT3A, and RUNX1, etc. suggesting that APC alone is not sufficient to drive leukemogenesis.  Conclusions:  Somatic mutations in APC gene are rare in myeloid malignancies. They can be either founder or subclonal. In founder cases, a second hit with recurrent myeloid mutations is required to drive leukemogenesis.","title":"APC mutations in myeloid malignancies: Incidence and impact on leukemogenesis.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150871-156"}
