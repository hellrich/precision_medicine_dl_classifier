The aim of the present study has been to investigate their immunohistochemical expression in melanocytic lesions. We examined 11 compound nevi, 12 dysplastic nevi, and 18 melanomas. Immunostaining for VEGF was observed only in melanomas; c-kit expression was detected in melanomas (higher in radial than in vertical growth phase) and in nevi (predominantly in the junctional component). Our data indicate that assessment of VEGF expression might aid in the differential diagnosis between dysplastic nevi and melanomas. Moreover, VEGF might be a candidate for targeted therapy. The loss of c-kit expression might contribute to melanoma progression.","title":"Immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and C-KIT in cutaneous melanocytic lesions.","pubmedId":"15173918"}
