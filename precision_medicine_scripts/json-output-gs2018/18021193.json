To investigate the association between CD98 and multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) in glioblastomas, we investigate the CD98 immunoreactivity of MNGCs and the proliferative potential in CD98 immunoreactive MNGCs in paraffin-embedded sections obtained from patients with glioblastomas. Double immunohistochemical staining for CD98 and Ki67 as a mitotic marker were performed in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from 16 patients with primary glioblastomas including MNGCs. Most CD98 immunoreactive (CD98+) tumor cells were negative for Ki67. CD98+ MNGCs were identified in 15 cases. CD98+ Ki67- MNGCs were identified in 14 cases and ranged in number from one to 48 (6.7 +/- 11.5). CD98- Ki67+ MNGCs were identified in 15 cases and ranged in number from one to 32 (11.1 +/- 9.6). Mitotic index (MI) of CD98+ MNGCs (4.8 +/- 2.7%) was significantly lower than that of CD98- MNGCs (91.1 +/- 24.6%) (P \u003c 0001). These results suggest that multinucleated giant cell formation may be developed by fusion among CD98- producing cells in glioblastomas.","title":"CD98 immunoreactivity in multinucleated giant cells of glioblastomas: an immunohistochemical double labeling study.","pubmedId":"18021193"}
