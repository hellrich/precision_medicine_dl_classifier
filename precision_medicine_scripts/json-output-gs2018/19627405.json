Whilst some melanomas grow slowly over many years, others can reach several millimetres in thickness in just a few weeks. Since melanoma is a visible superficial tumour, the information obtained from the clinical interview may be of use to calculate the speed of growth of the melanoma.\nThis study aims to assess the growth rate (GR) of melanomas and the association of this GR with various clinical and pathological factors and their usefulness as prognostic markers for localized invasive cutaneous melanomas.\nThe GR of melanomas was calculated as the ratio of tumour thickness to time of development, as obtained from the clinical history (in millimetres per month).\nApplying the GR calculation to patients with a localized melanoma showed a significant association between melanomas with a GR greater than 0.4 mm per month and an age of 65 years or over, male sex, nodular melanoma, tumour thickness, level of invasion, the presence of ulceration and a high mitotic index. As an independent prognostic factor for overall survival, the GR proved to be significant (P \u003d 0.024).\nThe GR of localized cutaneous melanomas may be a possible prognostic factor for survival. Additionally, rapid GR is associated with male patients more advanced in age at diagnosis, which suggests the need to assess new strategies for the early detection of these melanomas.","title":"Growth rate as a prognostic factor in localized invasive cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"19627405"}
