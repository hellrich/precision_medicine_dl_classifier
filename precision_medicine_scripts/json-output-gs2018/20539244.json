A total of 30% of the melanoma kindreds studied were carriers of CDKN2A variants, and three of these variants were known predominant alleles that have been identified earlier in Mediterranean populations (p.G101W, p.V59G and c.358delG). We observed a higher frequency of nonsynonymous MC1R variants in these Spanish melanoma kindreds (72%) with respect to the general population (60%). We observed a higher frequency of nonsynonymous MC1R variants in this Spanish melanoma kindred (72%) respect to general population (60%). A new classification of MC1R variants based on their functional effects over melanocortin-1 receptor, including the dominant-negative effect of some of them in heterozygotes, suggested an association of loss of function MC1R variants and multiple primary melanoma cases from melanoma kindred (odds ratio: 6.07, 95% confidence interval: 1.35-27.20). This study proposes the relevance of loss of function MC1R variants in the risk of melanoma in multiple primary melanoma cases with family history from areas with low melanoma incidence rate.","title":"Influence of loss of function MC1R variants in genetic susceptibility of familial melanoma in Spain.","pubmedId":"20539244"}
