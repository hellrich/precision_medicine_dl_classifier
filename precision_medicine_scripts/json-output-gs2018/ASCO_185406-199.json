Information on its prognostic value and its correlation with other relevant cancer related proteins is limited. Methods: We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses of p16, mutant p53 (mp53), and FGFR3 on 221 retrospectively collected OPSCC tissue samples. mp53, and FGFR3 were semi-quantified as weighted index [WI \u003d % positive x intensity (0. 1+, 2+, and 3+)]. Correlations of FGFR3 WI with p16 status, and mp53 WI were analyzed. Association of FGFR3 with disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) was assessed. Results: A total of 144/221 (65%) were p16 +, 93/172 (54%) had mp53, and 140/221 (63%) expressed FGFR3. FGFR3 was highly correlated with mp53 (p \u003c 0.001), which was true in both p16 + and  OPSCC (p \u003c 0.0001 and p \u003d 0.0006, respectively).mp53 level was significantly lower in p16 positive versus p16 negative group (p \u003c 0.0001). Univariate analysis revealed an association of p16 negative and high mp53 with worse OS (p \u003c 0.001 and p \u003c 0.001, respectively) and DFS (p \u003c 0.001 and p \u003d 0.004, respectively). FGFR3 was associated with worse OS and DFS (p \u003d 0.014 and p \u003d 0.047, respectively). On multivariable analysis FGFR3 was associated with worse DFS (p \u003d 0.005), but not OS. Kaplan-Meier plot using medians of both FGFR3 and mp53 as the cut-off values showed that higher FGFR3 and mp53 correlated to worst DFS (p \u003d 0.025) and OS (p \u003d 0.009). Conclusions: Our results suggest that FGFR3 is associated with mp53 and p16  OPSCC and correlates with worse clinical outcome. The biologic relation of FGFR3 and mp53 in OPSCC deserves further investigation.
