The RT-PCR used in the present study for detection of the major bcr-abl fusion gene, the hallmark and presumably the cause of CML, was optimized by: (a) increasing the amount of total RNA involved in the reverse transcription reaction to correspond to total RNA extracted from 10(8) cells; (b) using a specific abl primer in this reverse transcriptase reaction, and (c) reamplifying 10% of the RT-PCR product in a nested amplification. This optimized RT-PCR permitted to detect up to 1 copy of RNA bcr-abl synthesized in vitro, mixed with yeast RNA in a quantity equivalent to 10(8) white blood cells (WBC). Using the highly sensitive RT-PCR, a systematic study of the possible expression of bcr-abl RNA in WBC of healthy adults, children and umbilical cord blood (UCB) revealed the presence of bcr-abl transcripts in blood cells of 22/73 adults, 1/22 children but not in 22 samples of UCB. The comparison of these three groups indicated a significant tendency for the anomaly to increase in frequency with age.","title":"Very low level of major BCR-ABL expression in blood of some healthy individuals.","pubmedId":"8769701"}
