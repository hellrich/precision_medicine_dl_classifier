Here we report that some tumour-derived p53 mutants can bind to and inactivate p73. The binding of such mutants is influenced by whether TP53 (encoding p53) codon 72, by virtue of a common polymorphism in the human population, encodes Arg or Pro. The ability of mutant p53 to bind p73, neutralize p73-induced apoptosis and transform cells in cooperation with EJ-Ras was enhanced when codon 72 encoded Arg. We found that the Arg-containing allele was preferentially mutated and retained in squamous cell tumours arising in Arg/Pro germline heterozygotes. Thus, inactivation of p53 family members may contribute to the biological properties of a subset of p53 mutants, and a polymorphic residue within p53 affects mutant behaviour.","title":"A common polymorphism acts as an intragenic modifier of mutant p53 behaviour.","pubmedId":"10802655"}
