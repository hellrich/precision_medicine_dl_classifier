Its occurrence has been described in association with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, preexisting organoid nevus, and xeroderma pigmentosum. We present a case of solitary basal cell carcinoma in a 13-year-old boy with nonactive damaged skin or a genetically transmitted syndrome. The contribution of this case is to alert the physician to the possibility of basal cell carcinoma in children so that appropriate treatment may be initiated immediately and any delay avoided.","title":"Solitary basal cell carcinoma in a child.","pubmedId":"2538101"}
