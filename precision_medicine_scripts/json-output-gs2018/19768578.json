The affected individuals develop colorectal polyposis and show various extra-colonic manifestations. In this study, we aimed to investigate the genetic and clinical characteristics of FAP in Taiwanese families and analyze the genotype-phenotype correlations. Blood samples were obtained from 66 FAP patients registered in the hereditary colorectal cancer database. Then, germline mutations in the APC genes of these 66 polyposis patients from 47 unrelated FAP families were analyzed. The germline-mutation-negative cases were analyzed by performing multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the MUTYH gene. Among the analyzed families, 79% (37/47) of the families showed 28 APC mutations, including 19 frameshift mutations, 4 nonsense mutations, 3 genomic deletion mutations, 1 missense mutation, and 1 splice-site mutation. In addition, we identified 15 novel mutations in 32% (15/47) of the families. The cases in which APC mutations were not identified showed significantly lower incidence of profuse polyposis (P \u003d 0.034) and gastroduodenal polyps (P \u003d 0.027). Furthermore, FAP families in which some affected individuals had less than 100 polyps showed significant association with low incidence of APC germline mutations (P \u003d 0.002). We have added the APC germline-mutation data for Taiwanese FAP patients and indicated the presence of an FAP subgroup comprising affected individuals with nonadenomatous polyps or less than 100 adenomatous polyps; this form of FAP is less frequently caused by germline mutations of the APC gene.","title":"Mutation analysis of the APC gene in Taiwanese FAP families: low incidence of APC germline mutation in a distinct subgroup of FAP families.","pubmedId":"19768578"}
