First, we discuss and update knowledge regarding the molecular biology of BCR/ABL. We then review data regarding transforming activity of BCR/ABL. Third, we discuss the complex interactions between BCR/ABL and leukemia phenotype. We conclude with a brief discussion of possible therapeutic implications of these data.","title":"BCR/ABL and leukemia.","pubmedId":"8709625"}
