Immunohistochemical analyses of 9 biopsied pigmented lesions all showed normal expression of the tumor suppressors p16 and PTEN and no expression of mutated BRAF V600E protein.\nTo our knowledge, this is a previously unreported eruption comprising 2 distinct components: an eczematous reaction and a wave of melanocytic proliferations within the inflammatory regions. Possible explanations for this patient\u0027s condition, include immune stimulation leading to nevogenesis, benign \"nevic\" metastases, eruptive nevi, and epidermotropic metastatic melanoma.","title":"A Symmetric Eczematous Eruption Harboring Thousands of Melanocytic Lesions.","pubmedId":"27192392"}
