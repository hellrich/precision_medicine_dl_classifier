However, new technology and advances in the fields of molecular and cell biology have allowed investigators to explore the mechanisms of growth, invasion, and metastasis of lung cancer. In fact, it has been reported that angiogenesis is necessary for the growth and metastasis of lung cancer, thus indicating the therapeutic target. Moreover, VEGF has been shown to be essential not only for angiogenesis but also for the formation of pleural effusions produced by lung cancer via induction of vascular hyperpermeability. Here, we review recent findings on angiogenesis in lung cancer, and the possibility of the clinical use of antiangiogenic agents for lung cancer patients.","title":"[Role of angiogenesis in lung cancer and its metastases].","pubmedId":"10635295"}
