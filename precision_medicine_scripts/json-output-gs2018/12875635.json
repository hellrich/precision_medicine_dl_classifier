The overexpression of p53 was identified in four atypical carcinoid tumors, one mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and one adenoid cystic carcinoma, however, none of typical carcinoids showed p53 immunoreactivity. LOH in 3p14 was demonstrated in three of seven informative cases in all tumors. LOH in 9p was demonstrated in two of five informative cases in all tumors. Two of three cases with LOH at 3p14 had a poor prognosis, one of which also had LOH at 9p. No mutation of the K-ras gene was observed in any of these tumors. These data thus indicate that p53 overexpression might distinguish atypical carcinoid tumors from typical tumors and might therefore be useful as an adjunct modality in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary carcinoid tumors. The presence of LOH at 3p14 or 9p may thus help to identify lung cancer patients with a poor prognosis.","title":"Genetic alteration in carcinoid tumors of the lung.","pubmedId":"12875635"}
