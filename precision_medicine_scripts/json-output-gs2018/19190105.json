The BRAF mutation was identified by direct DNA sequencing.\nThe prevalence of BRAF mutation was significantly higher in any of the regions with high iodine content than any of the regions with normal iodine content. Overall, BRAF mutation was found in 387 of 559 PTC with high iodine content (69%) vs. 252 of 473 PTC with normal iodine content (53%), with an odds ratio of 1.97 (95% confidence interval 1.53-2.55) for the association of BRAF mutation with high iodine content (P \u003c 0.0001). In addition, clinicopathological correlation analysis, the largest one of its type ever, showed that BRAF mutation was significantly associated with extrathyroidal invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor stages of PTC.\nHigh iodine intake seems to be a significant risk factor for the occurrence of BRAF mutation in thyroid gland and may therefore be a risk factor for the development of PTC. This large study also confirmed the association of BRAF mutation with poorer clinicopathological outcomes of PTC.","title":"Association of high iodine intake with the T1799A BRAF mutation in papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"19190105"}
