In this study we used conditional onco-ALK (NPM-ALK and TPM3-ALK) mouse MEF cell lines (ALK+ fibroblasts) and transgenic models (ALK+ B-lymphoma) to investigate the involvement and regulation of angiogenesis in ALK tumor development. First, we observed that ALK expression leads to downregulation of miR-16 and increased Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels. Second, we found that modification of miR-16 levels in TPM3-ALK MEF cells greatly affected VEGF levels. Third, we demonstrated that miR-16 directly interacts with VEGF mRNA at the 3\u0027-untranslated region and that the regulation of VEGF by miR-16 occurs at the translational level. Fourth, we showed that expression of both the ALK oncogene and hypoxia-induced factor 1α (HIF1α) is a prerequisite for miR-16 downregulation. Fifth, in vivo, miR-16 gain resulted in reduced angiogenesis and tumor growth. Finally, we highlighted an inverse correlation between the levels of miR-16 and VEGF in human NPM-ALK+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas (ALCL). Altogether, our results demonstrate, for the first time, the involvement of angiogenesis in ALK+ ALCL and strongly suggest an important role for hypoxia-miR-16 in regulating VEGF translation.","title":"Hypoxia-microRNA-16 downregulation induces VEGF expression in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphomas.","pubmedId":"21778999"}
