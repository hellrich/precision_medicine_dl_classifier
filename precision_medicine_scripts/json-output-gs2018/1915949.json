After incision of Mullerian duct cysts, five pregnancies were produced. Five pregnancies occurred in the other groups using a variety of surgical techniques.\nRoutine vasography has shown that ejaculatory duct obstruction is not as rare as previously thought. The diagnosis should not be missed because the condition is simple to correct surgically in certain cases.","title":"Ejaculatory duct obstruction in subfertile males: analysis of 87 patients.","pubmedId":"1915949"}
