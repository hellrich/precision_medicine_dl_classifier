Fucosyltransferase IV (FUT4) is the key enzyme for synthesis of LewisY (LeY) carried by glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell membrane. Herein, we compare the expression of CagA, p-EGFR, FUT4 and LeY in gastritis (n \u003d 128, 176), gastric ulcer (n \u003d 174, 213), and gastric cancer (n \u003d 323, 261) tissue and serum samples, respectively by IHC and ELISA. Moreover, we investigated the potential correlation of CagA with FUT4 and LeY overexpression through EGFR activation. IHC and ELISA results showed higher positive cases of H. pylori CagA (83, 86 %), p-EGFR (81, 72 %), FUT4 (91, 97 %) and LeY (93, 92 %) in gastric cancer, compared to gastritis and gastric ulcer, H. pylori CagA (58, 67 \u0026 59, 73 %), p-EGFR (52, 63 \u0026 35, 47 %), FUT4 (68, 78 \u0026 67, 82 %) and LeY (62,76 \u0026 65, 85 %), respectively. We found a significant high expression (H-Value) of CagA (1.79, 1.66), p-EGFR (1.53, 1.58), FUT4 (2.14, 1.66) and LeY (1.69, 1.61) in gastric cancer tissues and serum, respectively as compared to chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, CagA (0.64,1.14), p-EGFR (0.856, 0.678), FUT4 (0.949,1.197) and LeY (0.68,1.008) (P \u003c 0.0001), respectively. Furthermore, H. pylori CagA showed significant correlation with p-EGFR (R-0.62, -0.74), FUT4 (R-0.81, -0.76) and LeY (R-0.82, -0.70) in gastric tissues and serum (P \u003c 0.0001). H. pylori CagA plays key role in the development of gastric cancer with overexpression of FUT4/LeY, serve as potentially correlative biomarkers of H. pylori CagA associated gastric cancer.","title":"Fucosyltransferase-4 and Oligosaccharide Lewis Y Antigen as potentially Correlative Biomarkers of Helicobacter pylori CagA Associated Gastric Cancer.","pubmedId":"27757838"}
