When HER2 immunoreactivity was equivocal (category 2+), specimens were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.\nER expression showed no correlation with menopausal status or lymph node metastasis (each p \u003e 0.05). However, expression of ER was associated with negative expression of HER2 (r \u003d -0.214, p \u003c 0.05) and positive expression of NM23-H1 (r \u003d 0.137, p \u003c 0.05) in the pre-menopausal group. Over-expression of HER2 was correlated with menopausal status (r \u003d -0.107, p \u003c 0.05) and lymph node metastasis in the ER-negative post-menopausal group (r \u003d 0.222, p \u003c 0.05). NM23-H1 was associated with less lymph node metastasis in the ER-positive pre-menopausal group (r \u003d -0.237, p \u003c 0.05).\nOur results indicated that expression patterns of ER, NM23-H1, and HER2 in primary breast cancer lesions warn that cells might have metastatic potential, which could assist clinicians to provide a more accurate prognosis and tailor therapeutic management for individual patients.","title":"Expression patterns of ER, HER2, and NM23-H1 in breast cancer patients with different menopausal status: correlations with metastasis.","pubmedId":"21913743"}
