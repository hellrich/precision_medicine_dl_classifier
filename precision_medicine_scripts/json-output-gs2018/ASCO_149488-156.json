Nevertheless, few is known about cMET amplification beside the EGFR-resistance setting. This study was performed in order to characterize patients with low-level, intermediate-level and high-level cMET amplification focusing on frequency, co-occuring driver mutations and clinical outcome.  Methods:    Within a regional molecular screening network cMET amplification status was analyzed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) in 588 patients with NSCLC regardless of histology. Next-generation parallel sequencing (NGS) using 102 amplicons and 14 genes was performed in all analyzed samples. Clinical parameters (age, sex, UICC tumor stage, smoking status and medical and therapeutical history) of all patients were assessed.  Results:    171 patients (29.1%) with cMET amplification were identified, whereof 17 (9.9%) had high-level amplification. cMET amplifications co-occured in 98 patients (57.3%) with a large spectrum of other driver mutations (EGFR, KRAS, HER2, STK11, NRAS, BRAF) or amplifications (FGFR1) in both adenocarcinoma (60.2%) and squamous cell carcinoma (21.1%). 9 patients of the high-level-amplified patients did not have an additional driver mutation, while the remaining 8 patients had mutations within EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF and STK11. cMET amplification was associated with a history of smoking and detected in all UICC tumor stages.  Conclusions:    Our data suggest a high prevalence of cMET amplification in NSCLC patients with many oncogenic driver mutations. Most patients with an additional mutations had KRAS mutations. These data show that screening for MET-amplified patients in order to identify patients for  MET-targeted treatment should not be performed on the basis of sequencing results.","title":"Genetic variability and clinical presentation of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring MET-amplifications.","pubmedId":"ASCO_149488-156"}
