Furthermore, while Pten null prostate cancers regress after androgen ablation, they are capable of proliferating in the absence of androgen. Global assessment of molecular changes caused by homozygous Pten deletion identified key genes known to be relevant to human prostate cancer, including those \"signature\" genes associated with human cancer metastasis. This murine prostate cancer model provides a unique tool for both exploring the molecular mechanism underlying prostate cancer and for development of new targeted therapies.","title":"Prostate-specific deletion of the murine Pten tumor suppressor gene leads to metastatic prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"14522255"}
