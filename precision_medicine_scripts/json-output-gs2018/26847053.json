We comprehensively studied MET alterations and the clinicopathologic correlations in a large cohort of treatment-naïve non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).\nSix hundred eighty-seven NSCLCs were tested for MET exon 14 splicing site mutation (METΔ14), DNA copy number alterations, and protein expression by Sanger sequencing, FISH, and IHC, respectively.\nMETΔ14 mutation was detected in 2.62% (18/687) of NSCLC. The mutation rates were 2.6% in adenocarcinoma, 4.8% in adenosquamous carcinoma, and 31.8% in sarcomatoid carcinoma. METΔ14 mutation was not detected in squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma but significantly enriched in sarcomatoid carcinoma (P \u003c 0.001). METΔ14 occurred mutually exclusively with known driver mutations but tended to coexist with MET amplification or copy number gain (P \u003c 0.001). Low-level MET amplification and polysomy might occur in the background of EGFR or KRAS mutation whereas high-level amplification (MET/CEP7 ratio ≥5) was mutually exclusive to the major driver genes except METΔ14. Oncogenic METΔ14 mutation and/or high-level amplification occurred in a total of 3.3% (23/687) of NSCLC and associated with higher MET protein expression. METΔ14 occurred more frequently in older patients whereas amplification was more common in ever-smokers. Both METΔ14 and high-level amplification were independent prognostic factors that predicted poorer survival by multivariable analysis.\nThe high incidence of METΔ14 mutation in sarcomatoid carcinoma suggested that MET inhibition might benefit this specific subgroup of patients.
