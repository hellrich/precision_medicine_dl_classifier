The studies have revealed that employment of colored filters in biomicroscopy and photography of the iris helps detect the pathologic shifts undetectable by routine examination. Examinations in polychromatic and changing in succession monochromatic light help carry out a sort of spectral analysis of the clinical features of iridal diseases.","title":"[Iridochromoscopy].","pubmedId":"1762359"}
