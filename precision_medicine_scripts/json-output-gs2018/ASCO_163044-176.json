The anti-MET therapeutic strategies are still unclear in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant patients and EGFR-naive patients. Aims of our study are to discuss role of MET amplification in Chinese NSCLC patients, and evaluate the antitumor activity of crizotinib (MET inhibitor) in Chinese NSCLC patients with MET gene amplification. Methods: From Jun 2015 to Jan 2016, we detected 11 metastatic NSCLC patients with MET amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). MET amplification was defined as gene focal amplification or high polysomy (at least 15% cells with  5 copy numbers). Patients with MET de novo amplification received crizotinib, patients with concomitant MET acquired amplification and EGFR mutation received combined therapy of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (gefitinib, erlotinib, icotinib)and crizotinib. All enrolled subjects received tumor measurement according to RECIST1.1 Results: The frequency of MET de novo amplification was 54.5%(6/11), and that of concomitant MET acquired amplification and EGFR mutation was 45.5%(5/11) respectively. 4 of 6 patients with MET de novo amplification received crizotinib, 2 patients had partial response (PR), 1 patient had stable disease (SD), 1 patient died due to heart disease. Response rate (RR) of crizotinib was 50%(2/4). Encouraging response was observed in one case ,a CT scan performed 31 days after starting crizotinib revealed 42.2% decrease , until now, a 7-month CT revealed 60.0% decrease in tumor measurement. 3 of 5 patients with concomitant MET acquired amplification and EGFR mutation received the combined therapy of EGFR-TKIs and crizotinib. 1 patient achieved PR, 2 patients had SD. RR of combined therapy was 33.3%(1/3). Dramatic response was observed in one case with combined therapy, a 2-month CT revealed 31.0% decrease in tumor measurement. Conclusions: According to our study, patients with MET amplification benefited from crizotinib, and RR was inspiring. Patients with concomitant MET acquired amplification and EGFR mutation need combined targeted therapy.","title":"A c-met inhibitor in the treatment of metastatic non small cell lung cancer with c-met amplification.","pubmedId":"ASCO_163044-176"}
