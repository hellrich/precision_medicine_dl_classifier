The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion typically results from a 2.0 Mb tandem duplication in chromosome band 7q34. In the present study, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based array analysis of three LGGs demonstrated deletions in 7q34 that resulted in a BRAF fusion. Case 1 was likely a pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with three deletions in 7q33q34 and an exon 15-9 KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. SNP array analysis of case 2, a possible dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT), revealed a 2.6 Mb deletion, which included the 5\u0027 end of BRAF and extended to the 3\u0027 end of FAM131B. In case 3, deletions involving BRAF and FAM131B were observed in both a primary and a recurrent PA. RNA-based sequence analysis of cases 2 and 3 confirmed a fusion between FAM131B exon 2 and BRAF exon 9. The presence of fusion transcripts in these three LGGs highlights the utility of SNP array analysis to identify deletions that are suggestive of fusion proteins. BRAF fusions can result from multiple non-overlapping deletions, suggesting various complex mechanisms of formation.
