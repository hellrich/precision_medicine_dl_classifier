Relationship between miR101 expression and clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis of colorectal cancer patients were analyzed. Fresh frozen tissues containing 5 specimens of normal mucosa, 5 adenoma and 47 colorectal cancer were examined by RT-PCR to verify the accuracy of LNA-ISH.\nExpression of miR101 increased gradually from normal mucosa, adenoma to stage I colorectal cancer (all P\u003c0.01), and decreased gradually from stage II(, stage III( to stage IIII( colorectal cancer (all P\u003c0.01). Overexpression of miR101 was related with lower incidence of lymph node metastasis, lower metastasis rate, higher differentiation and lower recurrence rate (all P\u003c0.01). Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that miR101 expression was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival (HR\u003d0.550, 95% CI: 0.351-0.863) and disease free survival(HR\u003d0.562, 95% CI: 0.397-0.794) in colorectal cancer patients. Overexpression of miR101 predicted a better prognosis in colorectal cancer patients.\nExpression of miR101 is associated with the genesis and development of colorectal cancer, and may serve as an independent prognostic factor for colorectal cancer patients.","title":"[Association of microRNA101 expression with clinicopathologic features and prognosis in colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"25940181"}
