Several genes have been identified in AML, such as FLT3, KIT, NPM1, and JAK2. This study investigated the frequency of novel mutations in IDH1 (amino acid R132) and IDH2 (R140 and R172) and analyzed their impact on disease biology and interaction with other mutations in Chinese patients with de novo AML.\nA total of 195 patients were screened for mutations in the IDH1, IDH2, JAK2 V617F, NPM1, FLT3, and KIT genes, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based and direct sequencing assays.\nIDH mutations occurred at a considerable frequency of 15.89% in Chinese AML cases; IDH2 R140Q was the most frequent genetic alteration and was associated with older age, normal karyotype, and French-American-British classification M2 at diagnosis. There was a strong association of IDH2 mutation with NPM1 mutations and a trend with FLT3-internal-tandem duplication.\nIDH mutations may be a novel genetic marker in cytogenetically normal AML and may cooperate in leukemogenesis.","title":"IDH2 mutations are frequent in Chinese patients with acute myeloid leukemia and associated with NPM1 mutations and FAB-M2 subtype.","pubmedId":"22494415"}
