Primary malignant melanoma of nasal cavity arise from melanocytes located in the mucous membrane. Only 0.5% of malignant melanoma arises in nasal cavity. We report a case of malignant melanoma of the nasal cavity in a 51-year-old male who presented with swelling of nose, nasal block and epistaxis. By brush cytology and CT scan imaging, the pre operative diagnosis of malignant melanoma was made which was later confirmed by histopathology examination along with immunohistochemistry by using S100 and HMB 45. Malignant melanoma of nose is rare tumour, with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Rarity of this lesion warrants its mention and emphasizes the importance of considering malignant melanoma among the differential diagnosis of tumours of nose and paranasal sinuses.
