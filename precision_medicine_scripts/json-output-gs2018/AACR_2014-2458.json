PTEN is one of the most commonly lost tumor suppressors in human cancer; in fact, up to 40% of men with prostate cancer are estimated to have lost a copy of the PTEN gene at the time of diagnosis. Slides stained with CymogenDx\u0027s PTEN del-TECT FOUR COLOR probe, developed for reliably detecting PTEN deletion, are scanned using 3DHISTECH\u0027s Panoramic 250 FLASH II digital slide scanner and the resulting whole slides are subsequently analyzed using 3DHISTECH\u0027s FISHQuant software. The ability to capture fluorescent signals from 9 independent channels and up to 29 different Z layers with perfect co-localization enables the creation of multiple labelled fluorescent slides. 3DHISTECH\u0027s Extended Focus feature creates a single in-focus image where all the in-focus parts of each captured layer is merged into one composite image. This enables the use of automated algorithms to evaluate different FISH probes in tissue and cytology whole slide samples. The FISHQuant software segments nuclei and spots automatically and scores the resulting data. For PTEN deletion, it measures the deletion clusters for the 3 colors involved. It also uses the control to check for numerical deviation of the 10th chromosome\u0027s signals. These two measurements are run automatically and displayed on a two-dimensional HistoPlot. This proof of concept study, using prostate core needle biopsies, demonstrates that the PTEN deletion FISH signals captured on a digital slide and overlaid in bright field and fluorescence modes can be subsequently analyzed using automated algorithms. The ability to identify tumor heterogeneity in a prostate core biopsy (and other sample preps) thus becomes possible. Extended focus and the patent pending PTEN del-TECT FOUR COLOR probe limits truncations artifact and makes a huge difference as sections get thinner due to other tests needing to be performed. Having access to the whole slide for analysis provides enough cells of interest.","title":"Automated analysis of four color PTEN deletion in prostate cancer using FISHQuant on a whole slide image","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2458"}
