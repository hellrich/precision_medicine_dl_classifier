Giant basal cell carcinomas are rare. They preferentially involve the trunk and are commonly associated with neglect. Giant basal cell carcinomas of 10 cm or greater are associated with a high rate of metastasis. We report a case of giant basal cell carcinoma of the leg which is not associated with neglect and no signs of metastasis, despite being more than 10 cm in diameter. The present paper includes a brief review of the literature.","title":"A giant polypoid basal cell carcinoma of the lower extremity.","pubmedId":"20187672"}
