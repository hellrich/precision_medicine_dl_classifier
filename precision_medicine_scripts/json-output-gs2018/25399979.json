The sample was divided into nine groups according to different day ages. Independent sample t served to test and compare the RET difference between two genders newborns, single-factor analysis of variance served to compare the RET difference of the different day ages newborns\u0027groups, Bonferroni adjustment method served to apply the pairwise comparisons. SPSS 18 was used for statistical analysis between males and females across nine age groups.\nThe normal RET reference values of male and female newborns separately were 2.408%-3.438%, 2.740%-3.912%. RET of male newborns was lower than that of female newborns, the difference was statistically significant (t \u003d -2.564, P \u003c 0.05). The RET difference of different day ages of male and female newborns was statistically significant (F \u003d 138.105, P \u003c 0.01). The comparison of the same day newborns proves that there is RET difference between the male, female newborns of fifth day groups, respectively (2.656 ± 0.067)%, (3.295 ± 0.149)%, there is statistically significant (t \u003d -2.219, P \u003c 0.05) . Newborns\u0027 RET vary with day ages, and there is obvious peak value.\nThere is RET difference between the male and female newborns, which vary with day ages. The study on the RET reference values of newborns of different genders or different day ages contributes to the clinical disease diagnosis and treatment as reference.","title":"[Study on the reference range of reticulocyte multi-parameter in newborn from Beijing].","pubmedId":"25399979"}
