To uncover other potential targetable mutations, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of a highly aggressive BRAF (V600) and KIT (W557, V559, L576, K642, and D816) wild-type melanoma. Surprisingly, we found a somatic BRAF(L597R) mutation in exon 15. Analysis of BRAF exon 15 in 49 tumors negative for BRAF(V600) mutations as well as driver mutations in KIT, NRAS, GNAQ, and GNA11, showed that two (4%) harbored L597 mutations and another two involved BRAF D594 and K601 mutations. In vitro signaling induced by L597R/S/Q mutants was suppressed by mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibition. A patient with BRAF(L597S) mutant metastatic melanoma responded significantly to treatment with the MEK inhibitor, TAK-733. Collectively, these data show clinical significance to BRAF(L597) mutations in melanoma.\nThis study shows that cells harboring BRAF(L597R) mutants are sensitive to MEK inhibitor treatment, providing a rationale for routine screening and therapy of BRAF(L597R)-mutant melanoma.","title":"BRAF(L597) mutations in melanoma are associated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.","pubmedId":"22798288"}
