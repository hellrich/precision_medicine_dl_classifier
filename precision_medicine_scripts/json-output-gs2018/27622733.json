The main diagnostic signs are visible on the skin and this opens several interesting aspects for dermatological point of view. The NF1 syndrome is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene which encodes the tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin. Neurofibromin functions as a Ras-GTPase activating protein (RasGAP), and NF1 mutations lead to over-activation of the Ras signaling pathway. The NF1 gene and neurofibromin have intriguing functions in keratinocytes and melanocytes. Neurofibromin regulates melanin synthesis and keratinocyte differentiation in a currently unknown manner. The NF1 gene has also an important but poorly understood role in tumorigenesis and cancer. Compared to the general population, NF1 patients have a fivefold risk for cancer and a more than 2000-fold risk for neurogenic malignancies. Mutations of the NF1 gene are common in numerous cancer types in patients without NF1, and this suggests a more general role for the NF1 gene in oncogenesis. In melanoma, NF1 mutations seem to drive tumorigenesis and contribute to drug resistance. In this article we review the literature on neurofibromin with special attention to keratinocytes, melanocytes, NF1 related tumors, and melanoma. This article is protected by copyright.
