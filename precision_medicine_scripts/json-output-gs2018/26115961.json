Appropriate treatment of these tumors relies on correct classification into tumor types and malignancy grades.\nWe examined 170 (0-18 years) pediatric and 131 (19-35 years) young adult brain tumors including pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs), pilomyxoid astrocytomas (PMAs), diffuse astrocytomas (DAs), gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs) for IDH1 and BRAF mutation/BRAF fusion gene status. The obtained data were compared to results in 464 (\u003c35 years) adult brain tumors. In 32 tumors with an oligodendroglial or mixed glioma differentiation, additionally the LOH1p/19q status was determined.\nBy combining immunohistochemistry and molecular methods, IDH1/2 mutations were observed in 6 pediatric, 35 young adult and 43 adult tumors of the astrocytic/oligodendroglial lineage. BRAF V600E mutations (20 pediatric, 7 young adults and 2 adults) were found mostly in gangliogliomas, PXAs, few astrocytomas and few DNTs. Except for one DA case, BRAF fusions (35 pediatric, 8 young adults and 2 adults) were restricted to PA and PMA and associated with age and infratentorial location. All mutations were mutually exclusive and always present in the primary tumor. Two-thirds of all pediatric samples harbored one of the three examined mutations.\nCombination of IDH1-R132, BRAF V600 and KIAA1549-BRAF fusion analysis is therefore a useful tool to increase diagnostic accuracy in pediatric gliomas.","title":"Analysis of IDH1-R132 mutation, BRAF V600 mutation and KIAA1549-BRAF fusion transcript status in central nervous system tumors supports pediatric tumor classification.","pubmedId":"26115961"}
