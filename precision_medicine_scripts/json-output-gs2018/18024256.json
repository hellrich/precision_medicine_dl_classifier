Patients in group A (n \u003d 7) were treated according to their individual chemosensitivity testing results, whereas patients in group B (n \u003d 7) received empirically chosen treatment regimens. Chemosensitivity testing was performed using a nonclonogenic ATP-TCA assay. For statistical analysis the Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival curves. The log-rank test was performed to compare the overall survival according to treatment group, LDH level in serum and AJCC-category. To compare the distribution of sex, LDH level in serum and AJCC-category between the treatment groups, the Fisher exact test was used.\nThe median overall survival of group A exceeded the median overall survival of group B by 8 versus 3 months, respectively with a median overall survival of 5 months for the whole study population. LDH level in serum at study entry showed a strong correlation with overall survival, with normal LDH levels leading to a statistically significant longer survival (p \u003d 0.006 for the log-rank test, respectively). Moreover, stage AJCC M1a/b yielded to a better prognosis compared with stage AJCC M1c (log-rank test p \u003d 0.066; not statistically significant).\nChemosensitivity-assay directed therapy might be a useful tool in determining the optimized chemotherapeutic drug or drug combination in the individual patient and might contribute to a better prognosis in patients with metastatic melanoma stage IV.","title":"Does chemosensitivity-assay-directed therapy have an influence on the prognosis of patients with malignant melanoma stage IV?
