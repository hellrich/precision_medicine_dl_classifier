The mechanism underlying this antitumor effect was investigated using the breast cancer cell line, SKRB-3. Cells treated with A10 were monitored for any changes in cell cycle, expression of protein kinase C (PKC), or intracellular signal transduction, particularly phos-phorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The A10 markedly inhibited SKBR-3 proliferation due to arrest in the G(1) phase. A10 down-regulated the expression of PKCalpha protein, resulting in inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK phosphorylation. This increased the expression of p16 and p21 protein, with resultant inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, leading to G(1) arrest. This study has defined a pathway in which A10 arrested SKBR-3 cells in the G(1) phase via PKCalpha and MAPK. Our findings indicate that the antineoplaston A10 antitumor effect could be utilized as an effective therapy for breast cancer patients.","title":"Antineoplaston induces G(1) arrest by PKCalpha and MAPK pathway in SKBR-3 breast cancer cells.","pubmedId":"16012735"}
