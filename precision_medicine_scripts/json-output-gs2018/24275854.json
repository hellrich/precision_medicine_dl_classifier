The treatments prolong patients\u0027 survival, but in general resistance is acquired and progression of disease occurs. Therefore, additional therapeutic targets are desperately needed.\nThe p53 tumor suppressor gene is rarely mutated in melanoma, but its functional attenuation is needed for tumor development. Recently, it was found that the essential p53 inhibitor Mdmx is very frequently overexpressed in melanoma. Mdmx displays both p53-dependent and p53-independent oncogenic effects needed for melanoma growth\nCurrent melanoma therapy based upon kinase inhibitors shows robust initial clinical effect, but the duration of effect is limited. Inactivation of Mdmx in melanoma inhibits tumor growth also of kinase-inhibitor-resistant tumors. An observed synergistic effect of kinase-inhibition and Mdmx targeting can lead to better and more durable treatment of melanoma patients.","title":"Reactivation of p53 as therapeutic intervention for malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"24275854"}
