{"genes":["T1b N2 M0"],"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma is a rare and benign tumor that usually presents in the inguinal region. We report the case of a 68-year-old woman with a right paratracheal mass and right upper lobe non-small cell lung carcinoma initially staged as T1b N2 M0. After mediastinal staging, the right paratracheal mass was found to be an intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma, which had caused erroneous upstaging of the lung carcinoma to N2 disease. This had the potential of leading to suboptimal treatment of the primary lung carcinoma if formal mediastinal staging had not been performed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in the English literature of an intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma occurring concurrently with lung cancer. This case highlights the importance of mediastinal staging in lung cancer. Mediastinoscopy remains the gold standard.
