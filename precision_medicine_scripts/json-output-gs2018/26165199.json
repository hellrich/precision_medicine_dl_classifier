The majority of breast cancers in men are estrogen receptor positive. There is a paucity of clinical trials to inform practice, and much has been extrapolated from breast cancer in women. Hormone therapy represents the mainstay of adjuvant and palliative therapy but may have contraindications or poor tolerability. We review the evidence for choice of hormone therapy in both the adjuvant and palliative setting in breast cancer in men. ","title":"Hormone Therapy for Breast Cancer in Men.","pubmedId":"26165199"}
