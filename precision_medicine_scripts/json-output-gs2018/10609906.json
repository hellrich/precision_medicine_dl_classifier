Major indications included pulmonary fibrosis (n \u003d 73), obstructive lung disease (n \u003d 55), cystic fibrosis (n \u003d 48), primary pulmonary hypertension (n \u003d 36), secondary pulmonary hypertension (majority Eisenmenger\u0027s syndrome) (n \u003d 30), and retransplantation (n \u003d 24).\nEarly postoperative mortality (\u003c90 days) was 13.9% (n \u003d 36). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in all recipients was 77, 70 and 63%, respectively. There was no significant difference in 1-year survival rates between the different procedures (HLTx: 78%, DLTx: 77%, SLTx: 77%). Significantly better 1-year survival was achieved in patients with cystic fibrosis (89%), pulmonary fibrosis (81%), obstructive lung disease (74%), and Eisenmenger\u0027s syndrome (83%) when compared to patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (55%). Survival rates remained unchanged during this period despite expanding indications during the last years. Causes of death in 90 recipients (HLTx: n \u003d 19, DLTx: n \u003d 37, SLTx: n \u003d 34) included sepsis (n \u003d 42), obliterative bronchiolitis (n \u003d 28), cardiac failure (n \u003d 5), and early allograft dysfunction (n \u003d 2). Freedom from bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) (\u003estage I ISHLT) was 80% at 1 year and 45% at 5 years.\nLung transplantation offers a true therapeutic option with good early and midterm results. Yet, chronic graft dysfunction represents a major obstacle for long-term benefit of this procedure.","title":"Lung transplantation--10-year experience.","pubmedId":"10609906"}
