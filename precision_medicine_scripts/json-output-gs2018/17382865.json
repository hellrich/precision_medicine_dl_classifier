These patients present with more advanced disease and suffer a higher incidence of loco-regional recurrence. Young women are also subject to more traumas to the lymphatics by virtue of their being more active. Treatment contributes to a higher incidence of lymphoedema in these patients. Thrombosis and infection may complicate intravenous chemotherapy, which damages lymphatic drainage. Modern radiotherapy delivers precise dosage and site targeting of treatment so that lymphoedema is less common. However, there is a tendency to return to aggressive treatment of the nodal areas. Early detection of breast cancer and sentinel lymph node biopsy will further decrease axillary dissection. Lymphoedema treatment consists mainly of compression therapy, manual lymphatic drainage and containment. Surgery is rarely required. Lymphoedema is a chronic condition that requires long-term care with patient compliance and active cooperation.","title":"Lymphoedema in young patients with breast cancer.","pubmedId":"17382865"}
