We evaluated PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 53 untreated pediatric patients with eight cancer types: neuroblastoma, extracranial malignant germ cell tumor, hepatoblastoma, germinoma, medulloblastoma, renal tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor. One rhabdomyosarcoma with the shortest survival exhibited membranous PD-L1 expression and germinoma contained abundant tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and PD-L1-positive macrophages. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway tended to be inactive in pediatric cancers. ","title":"Low Frequency of Programmed Death Ligand 1 Expression in Pediatric Cancers.","pubmedId":"27135656"}
