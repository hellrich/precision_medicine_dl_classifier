For preoperative chemoradiation, only 2 of 10 randomized trials showed advanced survival compared to surgery alone, and, therefore, more Phase III trials and, consequently, meta-analyses are needed. Until now, for palliative chemotherapy, no survival benefit has been shown. This is largely due to a lack of studies and difficulties in performing randomized trials. The application of targeted therapy is widespread and reported for several tumor types. For esophageal cancer, most studies have been performed with EGFR inhibitors, including cetuximab, gefitinib, erlotinib and trastuzumab. Limited experience is available with angiogenesis inhibitors, apoptosis inhibitors and COX-2 inhibitors. As yet, targeted therapies are proven to be safe often in combination with chemoradiation, but modestly effective for esophageal cancer. Phase III trials have not been published yet and, therefore, for targeted therapies also, possibly using new concepts, more studies are needed.","title":"Emerging drugs for esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"19453287"}
