In this article, the literature is reviewed to identify emerging therapies for advanced prostate cancer. Emphasis is placed on agents that have been approved in the United States of America (USA) and the European Union, or that have reached phase III clinical studies. Several new therapies have been approved in recent years across different stages of the natural history of the disease. Degarelix, a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist, has been approved for reducing testosterone to castrate levels in hormone-sensitive disease. No new agents have been approved for use in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy, the current standard of care for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. One immunotherapy, sipuleucel-T, has been approved (USA only) in the pre-docetaxel setting. Cabazitaxel, a next-generation taxane, and abiraterone acetate, an inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis, have both been approved as second-line agents following chemotherapy. Enzalutamide (MDV3100), an androgen receptor antagonist, has been shown to increase overall survival in the post-chemotherapy setting in metastatic disease. Denosumab, an antibody-based bone-targeted agent, has been approved for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases. Radium-223 chloride, an Î±-emitting radiopharmaceutical, is likely to gain approval soon following promising results in a phase III trial. Clinical studies involving other promising agents are ongoing. The emergence of these therapies adds to the growing armamentarium against prostate cancer.","title":"Progress in emerging therapies for advanced prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"23107383"}
