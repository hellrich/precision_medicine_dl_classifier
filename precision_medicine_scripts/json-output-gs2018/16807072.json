Tissue specimens of AdCCs and of PLGAs, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded were retrospectively studied using vimentin, alpha-SMA and c-kit. Positive staining for alpha-SMA was identified in all AdCCs and 25% of PLGAs. The immunoreactivity of c-kit in all positive cases of AdCCs (83%) and PLGAs (41%) was more than 50% and less than 50% of tumor cells respectively. The expression pattern for both alpha-SMA and c-kit, in tubular structures of AdCCs was different of that seen in the same structures in PLGAs. The results of this study support the potential application of alpha-SMA and c-kit as an adjunctive aid in the differential diagnosis of AdCCs from PLGAs.","title":"Application of alpha-smooth muscle actin and c-kit in the differential diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma from polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"16807072"}
