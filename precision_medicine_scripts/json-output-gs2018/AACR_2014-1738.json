Alterations in FGFR family members including focal amplification of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1), mutations in FGFR 2, 3 and 4, translocations involving FGFR 2 and FGFR3, as well as amplification or transcriptional upregulation of various ligand family members have been associated with tumor growth and survival, suggesting that FGFR inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in subsets of various disease settings. A number of agents targeting the FGF signaling axis including small-molecule FGFR targeted agents, with diverse kinase inhibitory and pharmacological profiles, are currently in clinical development.JNJ-42756493 (first disclosure of the structure) has a pharmacological profile that is differentiated from other agents in this class currently under investigation. JNJ-42756493 displays single digit nanomolar FGFR (1, 2, 3 4) tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. JNJ-42756493 inhibited recombinant FGFR kinase activity in vitro and suppressed FGFR signaling and growth in engineered cell lines and tumor cell lines dependent upon deregulated FGFR expression. JNJ-42756493 demonstrated highly specific tumor inhibitory effects in FGFR1-4 dependent cell lines, in vitro cell lines based xenografts and direct patient derived xenografts, with no discernible activity in models that were not dependent on FGFR signaling. JNJ-42756493 showed favorable drug like properties and displayed a high distribution to lung, liver and kidney tissue. JNJ-42756493 was well tolerated at efficacious doses and resulted in potent dose-dependent antitumor activity accompanied by pharmacodynamic modulation of tumor FGFR and downstream pathway components.Data presented here highlights JNJ-42756493 as a novel, highly potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor of all four known active FGFR kinase family members with potent antitumor activity against FGFR-dependent tumor models. These data, together with emerging observations from our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, position JNJ-42756493 as a differentiated FGFR 1, 2, 3 and 4 kinase inhibitor and support its continued clinical development in lung cancer and other malignancies associated with aberrant FGFR signaling.","title":"JNJ-42756493 is an inhibitor of FGFR-1, 2, 3 and 4 with nanomolar affinity for targeted therapy","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1738"}
