EGFR overexpression has been observed in several types of tumors and it is significantly associated with disease stage, survival, prognosis, and progression of cancer. The polymorphisms -216G\u003eT, -191C\u003eA, and (CA)n first intervening sequence (IVS1) have been related to EGFR overexpression and have been studied in several types of cancer, but not in gastric cancer (GC). The aim of this study was to determine the association of these 3 polymorphisms and GC. Genomic DNA from 68 GC patients and 102 healthy blood donors were analyzed. Polymorphisms were identified by DNA-sequencing (-216G\u003eT and -191C\u003eA) and GeneScan (CA)n IVS1. The results showed that the distribution of the -216G\u003eT and -191C\u003eA genotypes differed between groups (P \u003c 0.05). The odds ratio for the -216TT genotype was 4.59 (95% confidence interval \u003d 1.55-13.54, P \u003c 0.05) and 10.71 (95% confidence interval \u003d 2.31-49.59, P \u003c 0.05) for the -191AA genotype, both in a recessive model. The genotype and allele distributions of the (CA)n IVS1 repeat was similar in both groups. In conclusion, the -216TT and -191AA genotypes and GA haplotype of the EGFR gene were found to be associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer in a Mexican population.","title":"EGFR gene polymorphisms -216G\u003eT and -191C\u003eA are risk markers for gastric cancer in Mexican population.","pubmedId":"25867325"}
