Among sAML, 37 patients (29%) had a previous breast cancer. They consisted of 36 females and 1 male, median age 56 years, range 34-87. The median latency between the 2 malignancies was 54 months (range 5-379). Twenty-seven patients received chemo- and/or radiotherapy for breast cancer (7 only chemotherapy, 6 only radiotherapy, and 14 combined treatment). All patients were surgically treated but in 10 patients surgical debridement was the sole therapy for breast cancer. The drugs most frequently employed were alkylating agents (18 patients), topoisomerase II inhibitors (9 patients), antimetabolites (20 patients) (CMF, CEF and MMM combinations). At onset of sAML the median WBC count was 7.7 x 10(9)/l (0.8-153) and the median platelet count was 33.5 x 10(9)/l (3-305). Considering morphological features, FAB subtypes were 4 M0, 5 M1, 11 M2, 5 M3, 8 M4, 3 M5, and 1 M6. Cytogenetic study was performed on 28 patients and 12 of them presented abnormalities. It is noteworthy that chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities (typically observed in those patients treated with alkylating agents) were present only in three cases. Thirty-four patients received chemotherapy for sAML, and twenty-five of them achieved a CR (74%), with a median duration of twenty-eight weeks (5-280+). The overall survival was 8 months (1-80+).\nThe high number of sAML we observed in patients with a previous breast cancer, may be due to the fact that this malignancy is the most frequent neoplasm in women and by the high probability of cure with a consequent long disease-free survival. Our results suggest that the risk of sAML after recovery from breast cancer is increasing due to the rise in the number of patients cured from breast cancer, and in the future could be a relevant problem for haematologists.","title":"Acute myeloid leukemia in patients previously diagnosed with breast cancer: experience of the GIMEMA group.","pubmedId":"11300325"}
