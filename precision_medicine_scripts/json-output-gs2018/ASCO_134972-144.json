Search for molecular alterations could lead to identification of novel therapies for refractory sarcoma patients. Rarity poses an extreme challenge in drug development.  Methods:  We reviewed the charts of patients with advanced sarcoma patients who were referred to the phase 1 clinic at MD Anderson Cancer center and had molecular profiling done by commercially available CLIA certified labs. We analyzed the preliminary responses to matched therapy in these patients.  Results:  Among the 57 pts analyzed, median age \u003d48 years (M: F\u003d25:32), median ECOG PS\u003d1, median no. of prior therapies\u003d3. Most common subtypes were leiomyosarcoma (n\u003d13; 22%), rhabdomyosarcoma (n\u003d8; 14 %), liposarcoma (n\u003d7; 12 %), osteosarcoma (n\u003d7; 12 %), clear cell sarcoma (n\u003d3), and synovial sarcoma (n\u003d3). Forty-five/57 (78%) patients had \u003e 1 genomic aberration.  Each pts aberration profile was distinct. For instance, in osteosarcoma no 2 ps had the same profile. In other soft tissue sarcomas, aberrations involved CDKN2A/B loss or mutation (n\u003d10; 22 %), TP53 alterations (n\u003d15; 33%), CDK4 amplification (n\u003d8; 17%), MDM2 amplification (n\u003d7; 15%), and RB1 loss/mutation (n\u003d6; 13%). In addition, novel aberrations: KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein in a spindle cell sarcoma, CD30 + in osteosarcoma, and PTPRD mutation in Ewings sarcoma were identified. Molecularly matched therapy are ongoing (Table ).  Conclusions:  Based on the uniqueness and distinct biology of sarcoma, we conclude that the established model for drug development in sarcoma of one size fits all approach does not fit the reality of sarcoma biology. New creative models for precision medicine with regulatory approval, establishment of levels of evidence, modification of reimbursement policies by health care payers and innovative dynamic ways to collect N of 1 clinical data in real time with open access are warranted.DiagnosisAberrationMatched therapyResponseRMSPIK3CAPI3K inhibitorSD(18 weeks)Spindle cell sarcomaKIAA1549-BRAF PTEN lossRAF+mTORSD(26% decrease)(16 weeks)LMSPTEN lossVEGF +mTORSD(16 weeks)LMSPIK3R1mTOR+HDACSD(15 weeks)","title":"Diversity and heterogeneity in molecular analysis of advanced sarcomas: The clinical, regulatory, and financial challenge for drug development and precision medicine.","pubmedId":"ASCO_134972-144"}
