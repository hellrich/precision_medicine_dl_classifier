Preoperative scintigraphies were performed for all subjects. The rabbits underwent total thyroidectomy. The first group underwent immediate thyroid autotransplantation. Thyroid tissues of the second group were cryopreserved and autoimplanted at the eighth postoperative week. The free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroxine (fT4) levels were monitored for 8 weeks. Postoperative scintigraphies were performed at the eigth week after autoimplantation.\nThe subjects in the first group reached euthyroid levels at the eighth week while none of the second group reached that level, but all showed continuous increase. Although implanted thyroid tissues of 5 of the 6 rabbits in the first group were demonstrated during the first scintigraphy, the number was only 1 in the second group.\nThyroid autografts were found to be functional and thought to have a potential preventing postoperative hypothyroidism.","title":"Experimental autotransplantation and cryopreservation of the thyroid gland.","pubmedId":"24634027"}
