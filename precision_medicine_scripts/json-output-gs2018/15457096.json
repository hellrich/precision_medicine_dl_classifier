Archival tissues from 29 patients with mucosal melanomas and from 27 with cutaneous melanomas in facial skin were subjected to immunohistochemical procedures using the monoclonal antibody DO-1. p53p expression did not differ significantly between the two groups of melanomas. A comparison with previously obtained data on TP53 mutations from the same tumours showed closer concordance amongst mucosal than amongst skin tumours. Primary mucosal melanomas and their satellites showed identical patterns, focal or diffuse, of p53p expression. Thus, expression of altered p53p could well participate in the clonal expansion of these mucosal melanomas and in tumour progression. The p53p characteristics recognized in our investigations are amongst the first hallmarks in the emerging molecular pathological profiling of mucosal melanomas, and may therefore be useful in exploring the aetiology of UV-independent melanomas.","title":"p53 protein expression and TP53 mutations in malignant melanomas of sun-sheltered mucosal membranes versus chronically sun-exposed skin.","pubmedId":"15457096"}
