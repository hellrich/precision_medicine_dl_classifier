Here, we identify FOXOs as transcriptional activators of IDH1. FOXOs promote IDH1 expression and thereby maintain the cytosolic levels of Î±-ketoglutarate and NADPH. In cancer cells carrying mutant IDH1, FOXOs likewise stimulate mutant IDH1 expression and maintain the levels of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, which stimulates cancer cell proliferation and inhibits TET enzymes and histone demethylases. Combined, our data provide a new paradigm for the paradoxical role of FOXOs in both tumor suppression and promotion.","title":"FOXOs support the metabolic requirements of normal and tumor cells by promoting IDH1 expression.","pubmedId":"25648147"}
