Non-smoking-related lung cancer occurs more often in women than men, and the predominant histological type is adenocarcinoma (ADC) rather than squamous cell carcinoma. Most of the driver gene alterations that have been identified in ADC in never-smokers include epidermal growth factor receptor mutations, KRAS mutations, echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4/anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion, and ROS1 fusion, among others. Meanwhile, significant progress has been made in the treatment of ADC. However, in comparison with ADC, no such available molecular targets exist for smoking-associated lung cancer, for which treatment strategies are limited. Next-generation sequencing has been widely applied to the discovery of more genetic profiles of lung cancers. This review summarizes the differences between smoking-related and non-smoking-related lung cancer as follows: different somatic mutation burdens, C:Gâ†’A:T transversions, common and novel driver genes, and treatment strategies. Overall, smoking-related lung cancer is more complicated than non-smoking-related lung cancer. Furthermore, we review the prevalence of driver genes in smoking-associated and non-smoking-associated lung cancers in the Chinese population.","title":"Differences in driver genes between smoking-related and non-smoking-related lung cancer in the Chinese population.","pubmedId":"26331813"}
