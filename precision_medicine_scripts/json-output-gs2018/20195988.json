The risk of a second primary SCC of the head and neck is very high in patients with esophageal SCC. This prospective study evaluated the detection rate of superficial SCC within the head and neck region (superficial SCCHN) with NBI-ME in patients with esophageal SCC.\nBetween March 2006 and February 2008, 112 patients with a current or previous diagnosis of esophageal SCC were enrolled. All patients underwent endoscopic screening of the head and neck by NBI-ME. The primary end point was the detection rate for superficial SCCHN. Secondary end points were to compare demographic characteristics between patients with and without superficial SCCHN and to assess the clinical course of patients with superficial SCCHN.\nThe detection rate for superficial SCCHN was 13 % (15/112). The prevalence of multiple Lugol-voiding lesions, observed endoscopically throughout the esophageal mucosa after application of Lugol dye solution, was significantly higher in patients with superficial SCCHN than in those without (100 % vs. 24 %, P \u003c 0.0001). Minimally invasive curative treatment with organ preservation was feasible without severe complications in patients with superficial SCCHN after curative treatment of esophageal SCC.\nIn patients with esophageal SCC, NBI-ME is useful for detecting superficial SCCHN, thereby facilitating minimally invasive treatment.","title":"Narrow band imaging for detecting superficial squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20195988"}
