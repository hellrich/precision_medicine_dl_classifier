Several cytotoxic agents have demonstrated activity and combination regimens improve progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life. Nevertheless, now there is no standard therapy for advanced gastric cancer patients.\nTo evaluate the role of new investigational agents.\nWe analysed Phase I, II and III studies that evaluated tailored drugs directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the c-erbB2, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).\nData from Phase II trials indicate the potential of improved efficacy of chemotherapy when administered in combination with bevacizumab and cetuximab. Trastuzumab results are ongoing, while marimastat has not obtained clinical developments even if it has demonstrated to be an active drug in this setting of patients.","title":"Novel investigational drugs for gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"19466878"}
