Abrogation of pERK reduces 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on PET with recovery in glycolytic metabolism being a hallmark of resistance. FDG-PET also allows accurate quantification of melanoma burden. In a Ph1b trial (BRIM7), combining vemurafenib (vem) with a MEK inhibitor, cobimetinib (cobi), BRAFi-nave patients (pts) with advanced BRAFV600-mutated melanoma attained 87% confirmed response rate, by RECIST and median progression-free survival of 13.7 months.  We evaluated FDG-PET response as predictor of clinical outcome in BRAFi/MEKi nave patients (pts) treated with this combination. Methods:  FDG-PET scanning was performed in cycle 1 (C1) (day 10-15) and in C2 (day 35-49) of BRIM7. The percentage of the injected dose (%ID) of FDG and metabolic tumor volume (MTV), as measures of tumor burden, and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in up to 5 target lesions, as an indicator of metabolism, were assessed at baseline, C1 and C2.  PFS and OS were analysed by the log rank method. Results:  35 evaluable BRAFi-nave pts (mean %ID 1.62.9% and mean `MTV 166251 ml) demonstrated a mean reduction in %ID, MTV and SUVmax of 8614%, 7223% and 7618% at C1, respectively, and 9510%, 9212% and 8914% at C2, respectively.  All pts achieved a partial metabolic response (PMR) (\u003e 30% decrease in SUVmax) by C1 with 5 complete metabolic responses (CMR) (14%) in C1 and 17 CMR (51%) in C2. Pts achieving a CMR in C1 had longer PFS when compared to Pts achieving PMR.  Although tumor burden at baseline was not correlated with metabolic response, both %ID and MTV were predictors of OS. Pts with a baseline %ID \u003cmedian (0.36%) or MTV \u003cmedian (47.5 ml) had better OS (HR 0.19, p\u003c0.02 and 0.14, p\u003d0.03) compared to pts with \u003emedian values. Conclusion: Independent of tumor burden, BRAFi/MEKi nave pts treated with vem/cobi achieved a marked, early and progressive metabolic response on FDG-PET consistent with successful inhibition of ERK-signaling. Tumor burden was a predictor of clinical outcome in this small patient cohort with low baseline %ID or MTV associated with longer overall survival; further validation is warranted.
