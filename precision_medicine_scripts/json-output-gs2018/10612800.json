We have collected 51 pedigrees of familial breast cancer, 16 pedigrees of familial breast and ovarian cancer, and 30 cases of early-onset breast cancer (\u003c35 years of age) without any family history of breast cancer. The index cases of the 97 selected families were further subdivided into three groups based on histopathological parameters: group A (n \u003d 19) was characterized by tumor grade III, negative estrogen and progesterone receptors, and high proliferative rate; group B (n \u003d 20) was characterized by grade I-II tumors, positive hormonal receptors, and low proliferative rate; and group C (n \u003d 58) was not homogeneous for the histopathological criteria. The aim of our study was to evaluate, in patients with a family history of breast cancer or with early diagnosis of breast cancer, the incidence of BRCA1 mutation on the basis of tumor phenotype. We found the highest rate of BRCA1 mutations in group A (53%), and low frequencies in groups B (5%) and C (0%). Our data strongly indicate that an aggressive tumor phenotype in patients with a positive family history or early diagnosis identifies a population with high probability of carrying BRCA1 mutations.
