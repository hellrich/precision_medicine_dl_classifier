Although effective in cancer control, ADT is associated with multiple adverse effects of which physicians and patients should be aware herein we review these side-effects and their potential management.\nADT reduces serum levels of testosterone and estrogen, resulting in changes in body composition, increased fracture risk, development of insulin resistance, and an unfavorable lipid profile. A number of studies have investigated the association of ADT with cardiovascular mortality; however, it is unclear whether such an association exists. Recently, two separate clinical trials have found that denosumab, a monoclonal antibody, and toremifene citrate, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, could be used to reduce the incidence of fracture in men on ADT.\nBy providing clinicians with a greater awareness of the literature on ADT, we may minimize the physical and psychological impact of its side-effects. Physicians should be aware of a recent statement by a multilateral advisory panel, stating that there is no indication for a cardiovascular evaluation before starting ADT. Finally, physicians should be informed of recent developments in the prevention of vertebral fractures in men on ADT.","title":"Androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: anticipated side-effects and their management.","pubmedId":"20592607"}
