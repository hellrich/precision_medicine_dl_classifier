The patient was a 67-year-old man with synchronous double primary early-stage mucosal esophageal and advanced gastric cancer. We planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 and CDDP for the advanced gastric cancer and endoscopic mucosal resection for the early-stage esophageal cancer. After the first course of chemotherapy, the endoscopy revealed that the esophageal cancer had become a normal mucosal lesion, and the biopsy was negative for cancer. We diagnosed a complete response to S-1 and CDDP in early-stage esophageal cancer. After two courses of chemotherapy, distal gastrectomy was performed. The patient is still alive with no sign of recurrence at 16 months after the disappearance of the original tumor. These results suggest that chemotherapy with S-1 plus CDDP may be effective in early-stage esophageal cancer.","title":"A case of complete response to S-1 plus CDDP in early-stage mucosal esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"21498731"}
