However, some leukemic skin infiltrates are clinically similar to reactive non-leukemic infiltrates in patients with leukemia; thus it is of great importance to distinguish them. Fifty-four cases which were thought clinically to be leukemia cutis underwent immunophenotyping with a panel of nine T, B, monocytic, and macrophage markers using paraffin sections. Immunohistochemistry helped identify 44 cases with leukemia cutis and 10 with reactive infiltrates. In all cases of leukemia cutis, the staining patterns of skin infiltrates were concordant with cell type in the bone marrow. Furthermore, the panel of markers was usually helpful in distinguishing reactive from leukemia infiltrates, especially in cases with chronic lymphatic leukemia. Immunohistochemistry is a valuable adjunct in histopathologic differentiation of skin infiltrates in most cases of leukemia. With formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies, we recommend that CD45 (LCA), CD45RO (UCHL-1), CD3, CD20 (L-26), CD43 (Leu-22), CD68 (KP-1), lysozyme, and chloroacetate esterase be considered in cases of systemic leukemia with cutaneous papules and nodules that prove difficult to interpret with routine section.","title":"Value of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of leukemia cutis: study of 54 cases using paraffin-section markers.","pubmedId":"1383298"}
