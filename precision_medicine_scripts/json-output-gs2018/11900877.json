It accounts for 5-10% of all thyroid cancers. Hereditary MTC represents 20-30% of all MTCs. It can be transmitted with an autosomal dominant pattern, either as a single entity, familial MTC, or it can arise as part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome type 2A or 2B. The identification of hereditary MTC has been facilitated in recent years by the direct analysis of the ret proto-oncogene.","title":"Inheritable forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11900877"}
