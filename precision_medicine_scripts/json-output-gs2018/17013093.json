Numerous studies demonstrated increased levels of CDK-2 (and also of its regulatory cyclins E and/or A) in different types of human tumours. Correlations found between the expression of those cell cycle regulators and progression and/or invasiveness of some tumours indicated the importance of CDK-2 as a potential prognostic marker. At the same time, in vitro studies of melanoma cell lines revealed melanocyte-specific regulation of CDK-2. The present study was aimed at examining levels of CDK-2 in human melanomas and benign pigmented lesions to evaluate whether it might be considered a potential molecular marker of melanoma progression. Expression of CDK-2 was determined immunohistochemically in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens comprising 76 lesions including 41 primary cutaneous melanomas, 15 lymph node melanoma metastases (in eight cases correlated with primary tumours), three melanoma recurrences (two cases correlated with both primary and metastatic melanomas) and 17 nevi. Our results demonstrate that development and progression of melanoma are associated with changes in CDK-2 expression level. Statistical significance of the observed correlations indicates that CDK-2 may be a suitable prognostic marker for melanoma and perhaps also a target for chemotherapeutic drugs.","title":"Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 expression in human melanomas and benign melanocytic skin lesions.","pubmedId":"17013093"}
