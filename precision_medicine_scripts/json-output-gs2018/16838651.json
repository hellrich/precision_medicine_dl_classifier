High dose IFNalpha therapy(HDI) has been reported to be effective in disease-free survival (DFS). However, the usefulness of HDI therapy is still controversial due to its grave toxicity. Low dose IFNalpha therapy (LDI) has no consistent effects on DFS. Most trials showed little activity in patients with metastatic melanoma. In Japan, IFNbeta, in combination with chemotherapy, has been used as post-surgical adjuvant therapy, and has been considered to improve the prognosis of stage III melanoma patients. In addition, we have recently performed a phase I/IIa trial of IFNbeta gene therapy for advanced melanoma patients.","title":"[Malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"16838651"}
