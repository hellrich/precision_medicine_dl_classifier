Forty-five patients showed the b3a2 transcript (48%), 37 (40%) displayed the b2a2 and in 11 cases (12%) both transcripts were detected. Statistical analyses showed that these figures are in accordance with two of three similar studies realized in Mexican population. Moreover, significant differences were found among Mexican people and patients from other countries, namely Ecuador, England, Italy, Poland, Japan, and Thailand. Ecuadorian patients showed differences with all the populations analyzed. These variations could be due to a different genetic background.","title":"Prevalence of the BCR/ABL1 transcripts in Mexican patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.","pubmedId":"18268888"}
