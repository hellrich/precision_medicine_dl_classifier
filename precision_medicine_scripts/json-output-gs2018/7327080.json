Review of the literature reveals 19 cases of primary malignant melanoma of the cervix and 30 cases of blue nevus. The reported case offers support that benign lentigines may play a role as premalignant lesions of malignant melanoma not only in the skin, but aldo in mucous membranes.","title":"The pigmented portio: benign lentigo of the uterine cervix.","pubmedId":"7327080"}
