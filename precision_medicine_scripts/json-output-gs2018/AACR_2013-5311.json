We used whole transcriptome sequencing to search for fusion genes in glioma and discovered FGFR3-TACC3 fusions in 4 / 48 glioblastoma but not in any of 43 low- grade glioma samples. The fusion, caused by tandem duplication on 4p16.3, was found in patients of both Caucasian and Asian origin, and was mutually exclusive with EGFR/PDGFR/MET amplification. The 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) of FGFR3 is lost in the fusion, and we show that this leads to elevated fusion gene expression through loss of miR-99a regulation. The fusion protein promoted cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in vivo, while WT FGFR3 was not tumorigenic even under forced overexpression.","title":"The tumorigenic fusion FGFR3-TACC3 escapes miR-99a regulation in glioblastoma .","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-5311"}
