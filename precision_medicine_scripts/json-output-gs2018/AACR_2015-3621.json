In contrast, Wnt/-catenin signaling appears to play a paradoxical role in melanoma where its activation is anti-oncogenic and a marker of good prognosis. Previous studies have shown that activation of the NRAS/BRAF/MEK pathway suppresses Wnt/-catenin signaling and reduces apoptotic sensitivity to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in melanoma. MEK pathway activation stabilized AXIN1, a Wnt/-catenin inhibitor, in some melanoma cell lines through a proteasome-dependent process and co-treatment with Wnt3A and BRAF/MEK kinase inhibitors resulted in a reduction of AXIN1 and full activation of apoptosis. Further, AXIN1 knockdown sensitized BRAF/MEK inhibitor insensitive cells to kinase inhibition, providing a prominent role for AXIN1 in determining melanoma cell apoptotic responsiveness and exposing a potential mechanism for improving kinase inhibitor clinical activity. While AXIN1 protein levels appear to be regulated by ubiquitination, the enzymes involved in control of its ubiquitination or deubiquitination are not fully defined. Here we show that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked (USP9X), a deubiquitinating enzyme whose expression is elevated in melanoma, binds and deubiquitinates AXIN1. USP9X knockdown resulted in increased ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated depletion of AXIN1 (but not AXIN2), resulting in a reduction in AXIN1 cellular half-life. USP9X knockdown elevated -catenin response genes (\u003e2-fold) in melanoma cells treated with Wnt3A. USP9X depletion also increased apoptotic responsiveness to Wnt3A or BRAF/MEK inhibitor and overcame BRAF inhibitor resistance in A375R cells. In contrast, USP34 which was previously shown to regulate AXIN1 (and AXIN2) deubiquitination, did not alter AXIN1 levels or apoptotic responsiveness in melanoma. A previously identified small molecule USP9X inhibitor (EOAI3402143 or G9) replicated the effects of USP9X knockdown on AXIN1 depletion in vitro and in vivo, suppressed melanoma tumor growth in animals and fully blocked in vivo tumor growth when combined with BRAF kinase inhibitor. Thus, we identify USP9X as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma and established G9 as a lead compound for the development of AXIN1 depleting agents that may add to the targeted therapies already used in the treatment of melanoma.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.","title":"Deubiquitination of AXIN1 by USP9X promotes apoptosis in melanoma in response to BRAF or MEK inhibition","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-3621"}
