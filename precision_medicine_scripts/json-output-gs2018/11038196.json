There were 753 women and 247 men with a mean age of 42.8 +/- 6.7 years (range 17-86 years). Patients were divided into three groups. All patients had undergone thyroxine treatment and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression, and most had had iodine-131 treatment postoperatively. Group A consisted of 336 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who were treated with bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy in our institution or elsewhere. Group B consisted of 158 patients with DTC who were treated initially with unilateral total lobectomy and contralateral subtotal lobectomy in our institution or elsewhere and underwent reoperation in our department. Group C consisted of 506 patients with DTC who were treated initially with total or near-total thyroidectomy in our department. Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis was used. Recurrence was seen in 23% and death in 8% of the patients. The 20-year survival rates were 76%, 85%, and 92% for groups A, B, and C, respectively. The survival difference among the patients of group A and groups B and C was found to be statistically different (p \u003c 0.001). Long-term survival of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer living in endemic areas for goiter can be influenced by the initial surgical treatment. Patients treated initially with total or near-total thyroidectomy appear to have a better prognosis.","title":"Impact of initial surgical treatment on survival of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer: experience of an endocrine surgery center in an iodine-deficient region.","pubmedId":"11038196"}
