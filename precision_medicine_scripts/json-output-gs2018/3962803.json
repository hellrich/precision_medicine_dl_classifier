A 70-year-old male was admitted with the complaint of urinary retention. Suprapubic prostatectomy was performed on July 17, 1984 under the diagnosis of benign prostatic hypertrophy. The bilobes of prostate were 4 X 3 X 3 cm in size and 60 gm in weight. They were very soft and yellow-red. The histopathological examination revealed papillary adenocarcinoma of prostate. Glands were lined by a single or two layers of cuboidal cells with dark cytoplasm and a clear nucleolus. It seemed to arise from the prostatic duct, since serum level of prostatic acid phosphatase was elevated. But it was thought that prostatic carcinoma of acini grew in the papillary pattern, too. Therefore, it was difficult to identify the origin. Only hormone therapy (Honvan) was performed as postoperative anticancer therapy. During the follow up at the clinic, there have been no abnormal findings.","title":"[Primary papillary adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a case report].","pubmedId":"3962803"}
