Amplification of cKIT was found in 18% of cases; cKIT expression was detectable in 18% non-overlapping cases. No correlation between CD117 and cKIT alterations was observed. One (6%) cKIT and two (12%) BRAF mutations were detected in an additional series of 17 acral/mucosal melanomas from the same geographic areas.\nMutations of cKIT are infrequent in sinonasal melanoma in Southern Italy.","title":"Unexpected distribution of cKIT and BRAF mutations among southern Italian patients with sinonasal melanoma.","pubmedId":"23817129"}
