Despite significant anatomic and embryologic parallels between men and women, the multifaceted nature of female sexual dysfunction clearly is distinct from that of the man. The clinician cannot approach female patients or their sexual function problems in the same fashion as in male patients. The context in which a woman experiences her sexuality is equally if not more important than the physiologic outcome she experiences, and these issues should be determined before beginning medical therapy or determining treatment efficacies.","title":"Female sexual dysfunction.","pubmedId":"11402591"}
