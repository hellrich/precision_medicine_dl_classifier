However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tumor progression still remain obscure. As we know, tumor microenvironment that can directly influence tumor development and prognosis has attracted much attention of large number of immunologists. Accumulated evidence has suggested that tumor microenvironment is in a hypoxic condition, under which immune cells may exhibit distinct functions compared to those under normal oxygen tension. The article we propose here will offer a novel point of view for understanding tumor microenvironment in order to instruct clinical immunotherapy. Just like the pH buffer system in human body, interactions of immune cells in tumor microenvironment may also constitute a buffer system, the balance of which is of great importance during immunotherapy for tumors. However, many protocols for tumor immunotherapy in clinic at present have not taken it into account, so the therapeutic outcome is often disappointing. In the present study, we have demonstrated the effect of Corynebacterium parvum, a well known immune stimulator, on malignant melanoma. Cell ingredients in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and their anti-tumor effect have been altered when dosage of Corynebacterium parvum is changed. So, to obtain better therapeutic purposes, what we should do first is to detect an index to evaluate immune buffer capacity for the patient during tumor immunotherapy, then to choose appropriate drug doses to augment buffer capacity for their immune buffer system. Taken together, the hypothesis proposed here may help understand the pathogenesis of tumor progression and design more effective strategy for clinical immunotherapy for tumors.","title":"Tumor microenvironment: hypoxia and buffer capacity for immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"17360127"}
