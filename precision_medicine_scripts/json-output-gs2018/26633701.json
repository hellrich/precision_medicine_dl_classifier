The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of BRAFp.V600E, p.V600K, and p.V600R detection by immunohistochemistry in melanoma.\nImmunohistochemistry with VE1 antibody was performed on 18 tissue samples of metastatic melanomas with known BRAF mutational status.\nThe concordance rate of immunohistochemistry was 100% for p.V600E mutation. In contrast, the 7 p.V600K-mutated melanomas were scored as negative. p.V600K-mutated melanomas were significantly associated with older age, male sex, and worst clinical outcome.\nImmunohistochemistry could efficaciously be adopted as a first step for the detection of BRAFp.V600E mutation in the initial selection of patients with advanced melanomas as candidates for BRAF inhibitors. It should be followed by molecular techniques in p.V600E-negative melanomas, for the specific search of p.V600K and other non-p.V600E BRAF mutations.","title":"BRAFp.V600E, p.V600K, and p.V600R Mutations in Malignant Melanoma: Do They Also Differ in Immunohistochemical Assessment and Clinical Features?","pubmedId":"26633701"}
