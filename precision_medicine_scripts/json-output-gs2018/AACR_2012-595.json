After 9 weeks of running, mice (n \u003d 30 per group) received an intravenous injection of B16BL/6 cells or a subcutaneous injection of LLC cells, and then they continued with their running activities. Experiments were terminated 2 weeks after the intravenous injection of B16BL/6 cells or 2 weeks after surgical removal of the primary tumor from mice subcutaneously injected with LLC cells. Mice in the running group ran an average of 4-6 km/day for the duration of the experiment. Voluntary running reduced body weight compared with sedentary controls, but there were no differences in the number and size of lung metastases between groups with either model. Voluntary running significantly reduced plasma insulin and leptin levels and increased adiponectin level in mice with and without LLC compared with their respective sedentary controls. Having LLC significantly increased plasma concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), PDGF-AB and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in mice. Voluntary running significantly increased plasma PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB, but not VEGF and MCP-1, in mice with LLC compared with their sedentary counterparts. In summary, non-motorized voluntary running was favorable to body weight and the expression of related adipokines, but at 4-6 km/day it did not affect either experimental or spontaneous metastasis in mice.","title":"Non-motorized voluntary running does not affect experimental and spontaneous metastasis in mice","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-595"}
