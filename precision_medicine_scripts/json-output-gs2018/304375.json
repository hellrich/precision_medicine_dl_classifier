Schedules with very delayed \"low-dose\" leucovorin rescue following lethal doses of methotrexate were highly effective in preventing toxicity and achieved a pronounced antitumor effect in both ascites tumor models. Best results were obtained on a schedule of methotrexate (400 mg/kg s.c.) followed 16 to 20 hr later by calcium leucovorin (12 mg/kg s.c.) given once every 2 hr for a total of 5 doses. Progressive increases in the calcium leucovorin dosage on any schedule reduced both toxicity and the antitumor effect of methotrexate in each model. Following a single course of therapy, essentially no toxicity was observed, and the antitumor effects were 2-fold (L1210 leukemia) and 4-fold (Sarcoma 180) greater than a single, maximally tolerated dose (24/kg s.c.) methotrexate alone. An increase in the methotrexate dosage to 800 mg/kg s.c. with or without an increase in calcium leucovorin dosages on the same schedule did not appreciably increase the antitumor effect observed. Two courses of high-dose methotrexate (400 mg/kg s.c.) with leucovorin rescue (24 mg/kg s.c. 16, 20, and 24 hr after drug) given with an 8-day interval between courses doubled the total antitumor effect in each model with no substantial increase in toxicity and gave long-term survivors with Sarcoma 180. The results, overall, are in close agreement with prior prediction for schedule and dose dependence made on the basis of related pharmacokinetic and biochemical studies in murine tumor models reported from this laboratory.","title":"Optimization of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue therapy in the L1210 leukemia and sarcoma 180 murine tumor models.","pubmedId":"304375"}
