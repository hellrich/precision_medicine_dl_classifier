It is thought that enhanced expression of lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 in tumour cells may promote invasion by influencing both adhesion to extracellular matrix and perhaps also binding to endothelial cells. The present study was aimed at examining levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 in human melanomas and benign pigmented lesions to evaluate whether this protein might be considered a potential molecular marker of melanoma progression. The expression of lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 was for the first time determined immunohistochemically in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens comprising 42 primary cutaneous melanomas, 15 lymph node melanoma metastases (11 correlated with primary tumours), three melanoma recurrences (correlated with both primary and metastatic melanomas), 27 nevi and four epithelial tumours (two seborrhoeic keratoses and two basal cell carcinomas). Our results demonstrate that development and progression of melanoma are associated with changes of the lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 level. The expression was strongest in melanoma recurrences and lymph node metastases, weaker in primary cutaneous melanomas and not detectable in melanocytes of pigmented nevi. Nodular melanomas expressed lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 at higher level than superficially spreading melanomas.","title":"Different expression of lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 in human melanomas and benign melanocytic lesions.","pubmedId":"16718270"}
