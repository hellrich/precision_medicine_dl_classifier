We monitored the serum levels of KIT, KIT ligand (stem cell factor, SCF), and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with advanced GISTs treated with imatinib in a prospective randomized trial. Patients with GISTs (n \u003d 66) had elevated pretreatment serum KIT and VEGF levels as compared with controls (median, 292 AU/mL [409 ng/mL] vs 238 AU/mL [333 ng/mL], P \u003d.037; and median, 303 pg/mL vs 190 pg/mL, P \u003d.013, respectively), but lower levels of SCF (median, 645 pg/mL vs 950 pg/mL; P \u003c or \u003d.0001). After 1 and 6 months of imatinib treatment the average serum KIT levels decreased 31% and 52% from pretreatment levels, whereas SCF levels increased 11% and 33%, respectively. Serum VEGF levels decreased during treatment in responding patients. The median serum SCF/KIT ratio increased with treatment duration, and was 7.7-fold higher after 12 months of treatment than at baseline (range, 3.1-259-fold). A high serum SCF/KIT ratio may increase SCF-induced cell signaling with prolonged imatinib treatment, at the time when imatinib treatment is withdrawn, and in patients whose GIST has wild-type receptors.","title":"Serum KIT and KIT ligand levels in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated with imatinib.","pubmedId":"15070666"}
