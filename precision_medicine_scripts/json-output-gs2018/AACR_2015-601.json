Previously, glycodelin has been shown to induce cell differentiation in endometrial and breast cancer cells. In breast cancer this was associated with reduced xenograft tumor growth. In ovarian and breast cancers glycodelin expression has been found to associate with a favorable prognosis as compared to glycodelin non-expressing tumors. Some preliminary studies suggest that glycodelin expression is increased also in lung cancer and melanoma. We studied the expression of glycodelin in these cancers using immunohistochemical staining of tissue arrays. Furthermore, the levels of mRNA were addressed utilizing in silico transcriptomics database (IST Online).Glycodelin transcripts were more abundant in lung adenocarcinoma and melanoma as compared to non-malignant lung or squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and skin tissues, respectively. While immunohistochemical staining also showed increased staining of glycodelin in lung adenocarcinoma as compared to squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, there was no clear difference in staining as compared to normal lung tissue. Weak staining of glycodelin was observed both in normal skin and melanoma tissues. However, some melanoma cases showed very strong staining.In conclusion, our data show that glycodelin is expressed both in melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma, and in some cases the expression is increased. However, the clinical relevance of these findings remains to be established.","title":"Glycodelin expression in lung cancer and melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-601"}
