However, little is known about how N-Myc induces cell migration, invasion and metastasis. The histone demethylase JMJD1A activates target gene transcription by demethylating lysine9 residues of histone H3 (H3K9). Here we demonstrated that N-Myc up-regulated the expression of JMJD1A in N-Myc oncogene-amplified human neuroblastoma cells by directly binding to JMJD1A gene promoter. Affymetrix gene array studies revealed that the gene most significantly up-regulated by JMJD1A was the long intergenic noncoding RNA Metastasis-associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1 (MALAT1).Consistent with this finding, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that JMJD1A bound to MALAT1 gene promoter. Importantly, JMJD1A siRNAs, MALAT1 siRNAs and small molecule JMJD1A inhibitors impeded neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion. Taken together, our data identify a novel pathway through which N-Myc causes neuroblastoma cell migration, invasion and potentially metastasis.","title":"The histone demethylase JMJD1A induces neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-2985"}
