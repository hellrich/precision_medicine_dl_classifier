Recent data supports the hypothesis that the efficacy of vandetanib and cabozantinib, clinically approved multi-kinase inhibitors, is limited by toxicities associated with potent activity against KDR. Therefore, a RET-selective inhibitor would represent a best-in-class agent for the treatment of these cancers.Methods: We have established a robust screening cascade to develop a potent, selective RET inhibitor and developed several in vivo models to evaluate compound PKPD and antitumor efficacy. Tumor growth inhibition and PKPD studies were carried out in BaF3 mouse allograft models overexpressing KIF5B-RET or RETV804M and other disease relevant models, including an MTC xenograft (MZ-CRC-1), a KIF5B-RET lung cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) model (CTG-0838, Champions Oncology) and a lung cancer control xenograft (Calu-6).Results: Two orally bioavailable compounds displaying nanomolar RET potency and \u003e10 fold selectivity over KDR in cellular assays were selected from the lead series and further evaluated in our in vivo PD and efficacy models. Both compounds demonstrated efficacy in the BaF3 KIF5B-RET driven model (71% and 103% tumor growth inhibition (TGI), respectively), accompanied by reduced levels of pRET in the tumor tissue. Following further lead optimisation; a compound displaying an improved DMPK profile and additional nanomolar potency versus the gatekeeper mutation (RETV804M) was identified and accelerated through our DMPK/in vivo cascade. We consider this additional activity versus RETV804M beneficial since mutations at the gatekeeper residue in other tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGFR) have been shown to mediate acquired drug resistance in the clinic. This compound demonstrated significant TGI of 58% and 82% respectively in the BaF3 KIF5B-RET and BaF3 RETV804M allograft models. Moreover, tumor growth in the lung cancer PDX model was strongly inhibited (95% TGI) and tumor regression induced in the MTC xenograft model (109% TGI). As expected, this potent and selective RET inhibitor was not active in the Calu-6 model, which is sensitive to KDR inhibition, whereas vandetanib, a potent KDR inhibitor, significantly inhibited tumor growth (84% TGI). Additional in vitro and in vivo DMPK analyses further support the nomination of this compound as a preclinical candidate.Conclusions: The identification of selective RET inhibitors with significant in vivo activity and minimal toxicity may overcome the limitations of the currently available clinical compounds. We have made considerable progress towards this goal and show here the compelling data supporting our nomination of a preclinical development compound.","title":"A potent and selective RET inhibitor with efficacy in RET-driven mouse models of medullary thyroid carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-2092"}
