Currently, some 46 non-synonymous VUS entries exist in curated archives. In the absence of a gold standard method for predicting phenotype outcomes, this follow up study applies feature selected amino acid physical and chemical properties feeding a Bayes classifier to predict disease association of uncertain gene variants into categories of benign and pathogenic. Algorithm performance and VUS predictions were compared to established phylogenetic based mutation prediction algorithms. Curated outcomes and unpublished RET gene variants with known disease association were used to benchmark predictor performance. Reliable classification of RET uncertain gene variants will augment current clinical information of RET mutations and assist in improving prediction algorithms as knowledge increases.","title":"Predicting phenotypic severity of uncertain gene variants in the RET proto-oncogene.","pubmedId":"21479187"}
