Histopathological examination showed carcinoma in the wall of the cyst. Ipsilateral tonsillectomy was done and pathology revealed primary focus in the palatine tonsil. Diagnosis of the branchiogenic cancer should be made only when all the criteria defined by Martin in 1950 are met. Patients with carcinoma cells found in branchial cyst should be diagnosed and treated as metastasis from Waldeyer\u0027s ring to the lymph nodes of the neck. Ipsilateral tonsillectomy is indicated as blind biopsy. When histopathological examination of the tonsil is negative the patients should be treated as metastasis to the neck from unknown primary focus.","title":"[Cancer in branchiogenic cyst--primary focus or metastasis?].","pubmedId":"15311594"}
