Mutations in human mastocytosis patients primarily occur in c-KIT exon 17, which encodes a portion of its kinase domain. In contrast, deletions and internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations are found in the juxtamembrane domain of c-KIT in approximately 15% of canine MCTs. In addition, ITD c-KIT mutations are significantly associated with aberrant KIT protein localization in canine MCTs. However, some canine MCTs have aberrant KIT localization but lack ITD c-KIT mutations, suggesting that other mutations or other factors may be responsible for aberrant KIT localization in these tumors.\nIn order to characterize the prevalence of mutations in the phospho-transferase portion of c-KIT\u0027s kinase domain in canine MCTs exons 16-20 of 33 canine MCTs from 33 dogs were amplified and sequenced. Additionally, in order to determine if mutations in c-KIT exon 17 are responsible for aberrant KIT localization in MCTs that lack juxtamembrane domain c-KIT mutations, c-KIT exon 17 was amplified and sequenced from 18 canine MCTs that showed an aberrant KIT localization pattern but did not have ITD c-KIT mutations.\nNo mutations or polymorphisms were identified in exons 16-20 of any of the MCTs examined.\nIn conclusion, mutations in the phospho-transferase portion of c-KIT\u0027s kinase domain do not play an important role in the progression of canine cutaneous MCTs, or in the aberrant localization of KIT in canine MCTs.","title":"Evaluation of the kinase domain of c-KIT in canine cutaneous mast cell tumors.","pubmedId":"16579858"}
