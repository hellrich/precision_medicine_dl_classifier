In order to determine their possible role in the acquisition of metastatic potential throughout melanocytic tumour progression, VEGF and VEGFR-2 immunohistochemical expression were evaluated in 36 human melanocytic tumours of the skin (24 malignant melanomas and 12 common naevi). Different VEGFR-2 immunostaining patterns were detected in the vast majority of melanomas (21/24; 88%). A nuclear membrane-like pattern was mainly associated with in situ and microinvasive melanomas, whereas a combined cytoplasmic membrane and nuclear membrane-like pattern was seen in invasive melanomas. A nuclear membrane-like pattern was also observed in 83% (10/12) of common naevi. Cytoplasmic immunostaining for VEGF was observed in 72% (8/11) of in situ/microinvasive melanomas, 84% (11/13) of invasive melanomas and 91% (11/12) of naevi. CD31 was also investigated as an immunohistochemical marker for microvessel density (MVD) evaluation. No associations were found between MVD and VEGF/VEGFR-2 expression. Taken together, these data indicate that VEGF production is a common event in benign melanocytic tumours, whereas VEGFR-2 expression, co-localized in the cytoplasmic and nuclear membrane, is associated with progression towards invasive melanoma. The role exerted by VEGF/VEGFR-2, however, seems to be independent of the development of a tumour-related capillary network.","title":"VEGF and VEGFR-2 immunohistochemistry in human melanocytic naevi and cutaneous melanomas.","pubmedId":"15714119"}
