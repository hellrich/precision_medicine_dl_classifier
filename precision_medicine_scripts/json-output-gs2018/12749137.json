Its value in the diagnosis of male genital tract infection has attracted increasing attention in recent years. NE has special diagnostic value in screening the typical genital tract infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Trichomonas, as well as other kinds of genital infection, such as leukocytospermia and periorchitis. NE has been considered as a specific marker of the male genital tract infection.","title":"[Significance of neutrophil elastase in diagnosis of male genital tract infection].","pubmedId":"12749137"}
