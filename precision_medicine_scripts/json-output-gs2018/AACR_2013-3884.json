Many cancers secrete ATX, and it contributes to their invasive properties. LPA produced by ATX activates LPA1-8 G protein-coupled receptors on the cell surface. Many cancers over-express multiple subtypes of LPAR and the overexpression of LPAR leads to malignant transformation, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Therefore, ATX-LPA signaling axis is an emerging target for cancer therapy. We have previously shown that knockdown of ATX expression in B16F10 melanoma cells decreased tumor invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. In this study, we sought to understand the roles of the LPA GPCRs both in the tumor cells and tissues targeted by metastatic cancer cells. Using the in vivo B16 melanoma metastasis model syngeneic to the C57BL/6 mouse strain, we found that the incidence of lung metastasis was greatly reduced in the LPA5KO mice compared to WT, LPA1KO, and LPA2KO mice, respectively. In addition, we found that the selective inhibitor of LPA1\u00263, Ki16425 also reduced lung metastasis, suggesting that inhibition of LPA5 and LPA1 receptors in the target tissues may prevent cancer metastasis. B16 melanoma cells predominantly express LPA5 receptor. These cells do not invade across a matrigel layer in response to LPA. We found that siRNA knockdown of LPA5 receptors in B16 melanoma cells relieves this inhibition and resulted in an increase in invasion. These results suggest that the LPAR, in particular LPA5 receptors in tumor and stromal cells may play different roles in invasion and metastasis.","title":"Targeting ATX and LPA receptors melanoma invasion and metastasis.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-3884"}
