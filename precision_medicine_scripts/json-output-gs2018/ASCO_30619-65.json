However, the characteristics of Asianbreast cancer are not always well understood due to the limitedavailability of local data and their inadequate inclusion in globalliterature databases. Effective breast cancer treatment in this regionrequires a better understanding of Asian breast cancer biology,including ErbB2 status. Methods: We performed aliterature search in seven Asian countries on breast cancer studies inwhich tumour ErbB2 overexpression was assessed. The keywords erbB2OR HER2 OR ErbB-2 OR HER-2AND breast cancer AND (country)were used to search PubMed, international and local conferenceabstracts and local-language journals from the year 2000 onwards. Whereavailable, we selected up to five representative studies from eachcountry on the basis of population size, multi-institution patientpopulations, institution reputation and journal impact factor. Weexcluded studies containing only mRNA, serum, or cell line data orthose conducted on biased populations or in western countries on Asianpopulations. Results: ErbB2 data from 26 Asianbreast cancer studies are summarized in the table. The mean or medianage of the study populations ranged from 46-56 years, with oneexception. In most studies that evaluated tumour ErbB2 and hormonestatus, ErbB2 over-expression correlated negatively with ER positivity.Conclusions: The larger studies in particularconfirm that the proportion of ErbB2-positive breast cancer in Asia isgenerally similar to the 20-30% reported for western women. Definitionsof ErbB2 positivity using IHC vary between institutions and FISH is notroutinely performed in several Asian countries. This may contribute tothe fact that reliable, representative data on breast tumour ErbB2status is scarce in Malaysia, the Philippines, India and Thailand. Theincreased availability of accurate ErbB2 testing and data would aidimproved treatment of ErbB2-positive breast cancer in these countries.ErbB2 status in recent Asianbreast cancer studiesCountry (numberof studiesreviewed)Total population(study populationrange)Percentage range ofErbB2-positivesamplesDefinition of ErbB2 positivityIndia(4)892 (204-271)25.19-42.0Positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC)Korea(5)14,926 (188-9,668)24.5-36.9IHC 2+ plus 3+; or fluorescentin situ hybridisation (FISH)Malaysia(2)699 (306; 393)34.5; 44.4IHC 3+; not statedPhilippines(1)2,33320.0IHC 3+Taiwan(5)1,485 (63-1,028)19.0-38.5IHC 2+ and/or 3+; FISHThailand(4)5,812 (318-4,546)17.87-32.0Positive by IHCSingapore(5)802 (97-321)16.55-34.3IHC 2+ and/or 3+; FISH","title":"Breast cancer ErbB2 status in Asian women: A review of local literature.","pubmedId":"ASCO_30619-65"}
