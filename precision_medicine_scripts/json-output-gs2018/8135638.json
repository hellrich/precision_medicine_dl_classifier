To my knowledge, only four other cases have been reported in the English literature. This article reports a malignant female adnexal tumor of probable wolffian origin of the right broad ligament with extensive metastases to the omentum in an 81-year-old woman. The patient died 3 months after the diagnosis. The site and characteristic histologic features of the tumor and the absence of carcinoma of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus indicate that this tumor is of wolffian origin.","title":"Malignant female adnexal tumor of probable wolffian origin with review of the literature.","pubmedId":"8135638"}
