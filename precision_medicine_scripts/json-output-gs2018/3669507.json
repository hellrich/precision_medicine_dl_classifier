A choroidal lesion with brownish pigmentation and retinal detachment around it was found, located nasally of the optic disk. The lesion was clinically diagnosed as a malignant melanoma and the eye was therefore enucleated. Histologic examination revealed a strictly focal iron foreign body granuloma located intra- and subretinally, which had led to a localized siderosis as a result of connective-tissue encapsulation. It follows from this that an intramural iron foreign body must also be included in the differential diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The encapsulation of an iron foreign body located in the retina and choroid, with focally circumscribed ocular siderosis and glial overgrowth of the retinal defect can, in exceptional cases, justify a cautious approach toward splinters embedded in the posterior pole.","title":"[Strictly focal siderosis bulbi posterior].","pubmedId":"3669507"}
