If palpability was a reliable predictor of dermal invasion, it could be used to define the surgical margin.\nWe sought to determine whether clinical elevation of melanoma could be used to predict the presence or absence and the degree of dermal invasion in patients with stage 1 cutaneous melanoma.\nMelanomas in 165 patients were categorized by one observer as flat, just palpable, palpable, or nodular. This was compared with histologic measurements of tumor thickness.\nOverall there was significant correlation between the degree of palpability of melanoma and the presence or absence of dermal invasion (p\u003c0.001), Breslow thickness (p\u003c0.0001), and Clark level (p\u003c0.001). However, the relation between palpability and Breslow thickness for invasive melanomas less than 1 mm thick was weaker (n\u003d62, p\u003d0.053), and the correlation between elevation and Clark level was not significant for invasive melanomas less than 4 mm thick (n\u003d111, p\u003e0.999).\nWe conclude that palpability of melanoma is an inadequate guide to the presence or absence and degree of dermal invasion in melanomas less than 1 mm thick and cannot be used to determine the surgical margin.","title":"Does palpability of primary cutaneous melanoma predict dermal invasion?","pubmedId":"8601653"}
