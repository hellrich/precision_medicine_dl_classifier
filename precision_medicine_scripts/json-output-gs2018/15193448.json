The chromosomal t(1;9)(q23.3 approximately q25;q34) was found in a patient with biphenotypic leukemia. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the break on chromosome 9 occurred in the ABL1 gene. The breakpoint on chromosome 1 occurred distal to the PBX1 gene at 1q23.3, as shown by FISH using BAC RP11-503N16 and RP11-403P14, which flank the PBX1 locus; hence, the ABL1 gene can be fused with another gene distal to PBX1 gene.","title":"A t(1;9)(q23.3 approximately q25;q34) affecting the ABL1 gene in a biphenotypic leukemia.","pubmedId":"15193448"}
