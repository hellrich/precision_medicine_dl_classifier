These new agents are changing the Tx pattern and the clinical outcome of this disease. Methods: This retrospective chart review included all relapsed/refractory MM Pts who initiated drug Tx between Jul-06 and Jun-07 inclusive at Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, ON. Results: A total of 151 Pts were treated for relapsed/refractory MM between Jul-06 \u0026 Jun-07. 57 Pts (40 receiving IMiD, 14 Bz, 3 other) were on clinical trials and thus not included in the analysis due to proprietary restrictions. Mean age, % male and BSA was 64.8 (SD9.5) yrs, 68.1%, 1.9 (SD0.2), respectively. Time from diagnosis to current therapy was 46.3 (SD24.7) months. Nearly half the Pts were receiving treatment for 1st disease relapse (48.9%), 24.5% for 2nd relapse, 14.9% for 3rd relapse, and the remainder for  4th relapse. 74.5% of Pts had received at least 1 stem SCT prior to current study Tx. Current Txs included cyclophosphamide  steroid (36.2%), Bz-based (26.6%), IMiD-based [17.0% (thalidomide only)], steroid monotherapy (13.8%), melphalan + prednisone (1.1%) and other (5.3%). Overall best RR was 43.6%, and 41.5% of Pts experienced PD up to the follow-up period. Mean TTP was 9.6 (SE0.5) months. 30.9% of Pts received ESAs, 12.8% of Pts required RBC or platelet transfusion, 6.4% of Pts received G-CSF, and 47.9% of Pts received supportive pain medication. 27.7% of Pts required unscheduled hospitalization (56.4% due to MM and 7.7% due to Tx). Incidence of any grade drug-related varicella zoster, increased neuropathic pain, and thromboembolic events were 6.4%, 16.0%, 2.1%, respectively. Four Pts died while on current Tx and 14 died during the follow-up period of up to Dec-07. Conclusions: Bz was rarely used prior to public funding in Jul-06. Since then Bz (either as monotherapy or in combination) is the most commonly used novel Tx outside a clinical study and is replacing the use of the older agents. As the first analysis of current real world MM Txs in Canada from a large tertiary academic centre, this data is reflective of emerging treatment trends.","title":"Current treatment (Tx) patterns in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM): A retrospective chart review study.","pubmedId":"ASCO_34371-65"}
