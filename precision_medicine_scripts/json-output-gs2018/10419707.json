The 19 liver resections included right trisegmentectomy in six patients, right lobectomy in five, wedge resection in four, left lobectomy in two, left trisegmentectomy in one and a lateral segmentectomy in one. Resection of the biliary confluence with reconstruction by a Roux en Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed in three patients.\nMild abdominal pain, weight loss and gastrointestinal disturbances were the most frequent clinical signs. Jaundice was present in only four patients. Pre-operative radiological investigations (abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, arteriography) correlated with pathological findings in only 60% of cases. Pre-operative histological findings (fine-needle cytology, liver biopsy), available for 19 patients, did not always provide an accurate diagnosis. The mortality and morbidity rates were 5 and 47%, respectively. The median survival of resected patients was 18 months. Overall patient and tumour-free survival rates were 83 and 31% at 1 year, 33 and 16.5% at 2 years and 16.5 and 16.5% at 3 years in the resected group. Lymph-node spread, vascular invasion, positive margins and bilobar distribution were associated with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis.\nDespite the advanced stage of these tumours at presentation, patient survival can be improved by aggressive surgical resection. As intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma usually develops in a non-cirrhotic liver, major hepatic resections to obtain disease-free margins can be performed with low mortality.","title":"Peripheral cholangiocarcinoma: presentation, diagnosis, pathology and management.","pubmedId":"10419707"}
