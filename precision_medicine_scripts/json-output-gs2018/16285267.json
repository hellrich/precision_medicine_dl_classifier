The concentrations were compared between the various groups and subgroups; the cutoff value was calculated with a receiver operating characteristic curve. Furthermore, the serum concentrations of Cyfra 21-1 before treatment in the group of 300 patients were compared with the stage of the disease and with the evolution of the overall survival rate and the disease-free survival rate. Finally, to determine whether Cyfra 21-1 is an independent prognostic factor, we compared the concentrations, by a Cox model, with the classic prognostic factors of HNSCC.\nAt the cutoff value of 1 ng/mL, the specificity was 94% and the sensitivity was 72%. The serum concentrations of Cyfra 21-1 were statistically correlated with the stage of the disease. The overall survival rate and the disease-free survival rate were lower in patients with high serum concentrations, and these differences were statistically significant (p \u003c .001). The Cox model allows us to conclude that Cyfra 21-1 is a prognostic marker that is independent of other classic prognostic factors.\nCyfra 21-1 is an interesting tumor marker that could be proposed for the early detection of HNSCC with a cutoff value of 1 ng/mL. Furthermore, Cyfra 21-1 can be considered an independent prognostic marker.","title":"Study of cyfra 21-1, a tumor marker, in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16285267"}
