The patient was a 68-year-old male who visited our department with the main complaint of ulceration in the left mandibular gingiva. Biopsy revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which extended to the mandible, mandibular gingiva, buccal mucosa, half tongue and oral floor on the left side of the face. As a neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), 254-S at a dose of 100 mg/m2 was intravenously administered on day 1, while 5-FU at a dose of 700 mg/m2/day was intravenously administered from day 1 to 5 in succession. Hydration (2,000 ml/day) was performed from day 1 to 3. Adverse reactions observed included thrombocytopenia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis and SIADH, but no sign of renal dysfunction was observed. The clinical outcome was evaluated as CR. Surgery was performed later. Pathological examination of the extracted tissues showed tumor cells in the tongue only, indicating an excellent effect of this combination therapy of 254-S and 5-FU.","title":"[A case of mandibular gingival cancer T4N0M0 which markedly responded to a combined therapy of nedaplatin with 5-fluorouracil].","pubmedId":"11579639"}
