POMC is expressed not only in the pituitary gland but also in a variety of nonpituitary organs and tumors, including melanomas. We previously showed that normal human melanocytes produce and secrete alpha-MSH and ACTH, and furthermore, that advanced melanoma cells generally produce higher amounts of POMC peptides that correlate with tumor progression. To elucidate the mechanism of this upregulation, the expression of genes encoding corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its receptor, CRH-R, as well as POMC and the MSH receptor (MC1-R), was evaluated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using cultured human melanoma cells, nevus cells, and normal melanocytes. Our results show that all melanocytic cells express CRH, CRH-R, POMC, and MC1-R, with highest intensities in melanoma cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry shows that CRH as well as POMC is strongly expressed in advanced melanomas, such as vertically growing lesions of acral lentiginous, nodular and metastatic melanomas, in contrast to negative expression in nevus cells. These results indicate that tumor progression accentuates CRH, CRH-R, and POMC expression by melanoma cells.","title":"Expression of proopiomelanocortin, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and CRH receptor in melanoma cells, nevus cells, and normal human melanocytes.","pubmedId":"10536983"}
