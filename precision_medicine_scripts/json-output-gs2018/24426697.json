We present an unusual case of a 70-year-old male with prostate cancer who developed erythematous papulo-nodular lesion on lower abdominal wall, both groins and external genitalia. Biopsy from the cutaneous lesion showed metastatic adenocarcinoma cells in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Immunohistochemistry was positive for prostate specific antigen confirming cutaneous metastasis from prostate cancer. Recognition of such entity is important as it may be mistaken for other skin diseases.
