His treatment course to date has included surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and interferon, metastasectomies, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4032), clinical trial with combination BRAF plus MEK inhibition with vemurafenib plus GDC-0973, and combination targeted and immune therapy with vemurafenib plus the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab. This case report illustrates the long-term management of a patient with metastatic melanoma using targeted and immune therapy, evolution in treatment guidelines, next directions in research, and the critical role of clinical trials in advancement of patient care.
