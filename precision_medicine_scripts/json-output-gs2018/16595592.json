The results were compared with those similarly obtained in 34 papillary carcinomas, eight thyroid oncocytic tumors, and 21 normal thyroids.\nNormal samples showed no RET rearrangement. Sixty-eight percent (15 of 22) of HT were positive by FISH; in all thyroiditis, signals were localized to rare nonneoplastic follicular cells; low-level RET/PTC was identified in 17% (five of 29) of thyroiditis cases by real-time RT-PCR and in an additional six of 11 real-time negative cases after increasing sensitivity with laser capture microdissection. Low RET/PTC1 levels were detected in 26% (nine of 34) of papillary carcinomas with an expression pattern and proportion of FISH-positive cells similar to those of the thyroiditis. Forty-seven percent (16 of 34) of papillary carcinomas and one oncocytic carcinoma expressed high RET/PTC1 mRNA levels.\nLow-level RET/PTC recombination occurs in nonneoplastic follicular cells in HT and in a subset of papillary thyroid carcinomas. RET/PTC expression variability should be taken into account for the molecular diagnosis of thyroid lesions. Overlapping molecular mechanisms may govern early stages of tumor development and inflammation in the thyroid.","title":"RET/papillary thyroid cancer rearrangement in nonneoplastic thyrocytes: follicular cells of Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis share low-level recombination events with a subset of papillary carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16595592"}
