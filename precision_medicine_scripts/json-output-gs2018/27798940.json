Of these, p.F285S in exon 4, c.854_855CA in exon 4, and p.D707E in exon 11 are reported for the first time in our study. (2) Both linkage disequilibrium analysis and logistic regression analysis showed a significant correlation between the p.D707E variant and HMTC (LOD \u003d 3.69, OR \u003d 4.413, p \u003d 0.000167), indicating that this variant is a risk factor for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). (3) The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) G691S in exon 11 (rs1799939), S904S in exon 15 (rs1800863), and rs2075912 and rs2565200 in the 3\u0027-untranslated region of the RET proto-oncogene are in complete linkage disequilibrium (D\u0027 \u003d 1, r2 \u003d 1); no correlation of these SNP and MTC was observed in this pedigree. (4) No hot-spot mutation of the RET proto-oncogene was detected in this pedigree. We drew the conclusion that the heterozygous nonsynonymous variant p.D707E in the RET proto-oncogene is rare, but it is a risk factor for hereditary MTC.","title":"Rare RET Variant p.D707E in a Chinese Pedigree with Hereditary Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.","pubmedId":"27798940"}
