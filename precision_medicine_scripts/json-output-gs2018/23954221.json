This study aims to analyze the prognostic value of EGFR in patients with gastric cancer.\nA meta-analysis is performed by searching Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and Science Direct databases from Jan 1970 to May 2013. Data are extracted from studies evaluating the survival of gastric cancer patients with either positive or negative EGFR expression. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are calculated.\nTotally 1600 cases of gastric cancer patients from five studies are subjected to final analysis. The HR of post-operational survival of patients with positive EGFR expression is 1.16 (95% CI: 0.94-1.43) as compared with those with negative expression, indicating that positive EGFR expression does not significantly predict the poor survival of gastric cancer.\nEGFR expression is not an independent predictor for the survival of gastric cancer patients.","title":"Prognostic value of epidermal growth factor receptor in patients with gastric cancer: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"23954221"}
