The group included all the hospitals that could diagnose leukemia.\n①We registered 1 551 new adult AL cases totally during 2011 and 2012. The average annual incidence was 2.479/10⁵. 777 new adult AL cases were diagnosed among the whole adult population in Fujian Province in 2011.The crude incidence rate (CIR) was 2.498/105, and age- standardized incidence rate (ASR) was 2.504/10⁵. 774 new adult AL cases were diagnosed in 2012 with 2.460/10⁵ of CIR and 2.455/10⁵ of ASR. No significant changes of the adult AL incidence were found over time during 2011 and 2012. ② During 2011 and 2012, 938 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML, non-M) were diagnosed,with 1.499/10⁵ of CIR. 393 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (ALL) with 0.628/10⁵ of CIR, 199 cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with 0.318/10⁵ of CIR, 21 cases of the special type with 0.034/10⁵ of CIR. The incidence of AML (non-M) was highest (accounting for 60.48%）, followed by ALL (25.34%）, APL (12.83%）. The special type (1.35%) was the lowest. ③ The survey revealed differences in gender, age, region and season of incidence in Fujian province. The male gender bias of AML and ALL were also observed. The incidence of adult AL increased with age, and reached to the peak in group aged 75-79 (7.081/10⁵）.\nThe incidence of adult AL in Fujian province is in average level in China from 2011 to 2012, according to the leukemia incidence data of International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Compared with the previous national leukemia incidence during 1986 and 1988, the incidence in Fujian is slightly higher. We find no significant changes of the incidence from 2011 to 2012. The constituent ratios of various types of adult AL in Fujian are similar to the previous studies of national incidence rate during 1986-1988.","title":"[Incidence of newly diagnosed adult acute leukemia in Fujian province from 2011 to 2012].","pubmedId":"26462771"}
