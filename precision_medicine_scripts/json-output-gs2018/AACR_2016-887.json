This transition is emerging as an important mechanism of treatment resistance. This cell plasticity is characterized by loss of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA), and significant over-expression and gene amplification of MYCN (encoding N-Myc). While N-Myc is a bona fide driver oncogene in several rare tumor types, the molecular mechanisms that underlie N-Myc driven NEPC have yet to be characterized.Integrating a novel genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of prostate specific N-Myc overexpression, human prostate cancer cell line modeling, and human prostate cancer transcriptome data, we found that N-Myc over-expression leads to the development of poorly differentiated, invasive prostate cancer that is molecularly similar to human NEPC tumors. To determine if N-Myc plays a causal role in driving the NEPC phenotype, we generated GEM lines that carry a CAG-driven lox-stop-lox human MYCN gene integrated into the ROSA26 (LSL-MYCN) locus and either a Tmprss2 driven tamoxifen-activated Cre recombinase (T2-Cre) or probasin (Pb)-Cre. Since PTEN deletion is a frequent alteration in CRPC and PI3K/AKT signaling can enhance N-Myc protein stability we also engineered the mice with a floxed Pten locus. N-Myc over-expression in the context of Ptenf/+ at 3 months post-induction leads to focal mouse high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mHGPIN). T2-Cre; Ptenf/f; LSL-MYCN+/+ mice develop highly proliferative, diffuse mHGPIN which consists of proliferations of cells with nuclear atypia that expand the glands, imparting irregular borders and inducing a mild stromal response, mitotic figures, and incipient necrosis. RNAseq data from N-Myc these mHGPIN lesions show they are molecularly similar to NEPC based on RNAseq data from 203 human CRPC and NEPC samples. At 6 months, Pb-Cre; Ptenf/f; LSL-MYCN+/+ mice develop poorly differentiated, highly proliferative, invasive prostate cancer.Based on the RNAseq data from the N-Myc GEM line, GEM-derived mouse prostate cancer organoid cultures and isogenic cell lines, we found that N-Myc regulates a specific NEPC-associated molecular program that includes a repression of AR signaling, enhanced AKT signaling and repression of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 target genes. We further showed that N-Myc interacts with AR and this interaction depends on Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2). Finally, N-Myc expressing cell lines and organoids displayed an enhanced sensitivity to inhibitors targeting the AKT pathway, EZH2 and Aurora-A.Altogether, our data shows that N-Myc drives the neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate cancer and provides rationale for the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating this aggressive subtype of prostate cancer.","title":"N-Myc drives neuroendocrine prostate cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-887"}
