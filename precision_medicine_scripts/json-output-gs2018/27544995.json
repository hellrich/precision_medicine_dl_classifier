Methods Totally 135 PTC patients were enrolled and divided into two groups according to BRAF(V600E) gene status:BRAF(V600E) mutation group(n\u003d105) and BRAF(V600E) wild group(n\u003d30). The median follow-up time was 2.16 years(1.03-4.06 years),and clinical outcome after initial (131)I ablation therapy was divided into excellent response(ER),acceptable response(AR),and incomplete response(IR) according to the serological and imageological follow-up results. The cinical outcomes were then compared between these two groups. Results There was no significant difference in clinicopathological features and initial radioactive iodine dose between BRAF(V600E) mutation and wild groups (P\u003e0.05). ER,AR,and IR after (131)I ablation therapy accounted for 74.3%,20.0%,and 5.7% in BRAF(V600E) mutation group and 73.3%,20.0%,and 6.7% in BRAF(V600E) wild group,and no statistical difference was found (P\u003d0.891). Conclusion For low-intermediate risk recurrent PTC,BRAF(V600E) gene status may have no impact on the response to (131)I ablation therapy,and thus this molecular feature should not be used as an independent weighting factor for risk assessment in this population.
