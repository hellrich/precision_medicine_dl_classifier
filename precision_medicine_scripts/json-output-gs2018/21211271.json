The expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), AR and c-erbB2 protein were assessed in breast cancer tissue before chemotherapy by using immunohistochemistry methods. The correlations between AR expression and lymph node status, c-erbB2 expression in patients who were classified as two subsets according to the lymph node status and c-erbB2 over-expression and the prognostic significance of AR expression were analyzed.\nAll the 184 patients were followed up for more than 5 years. The lymph node involvement, 5-year metastasis and 5-year survival rate were 45.1%, 16.9% and 86.4%, respectively. The 184 patients were classified as two subsets of node-negative and node-positive group. The Chi-square test showed an lowly inverse correlation between AR and lymph node status (P\u003c0.05, rs\u003d-0.236), AR expression rate was lower in patients with positive nodes. The Kaplan-Meier test showed that AR expression had no influence on prognosis in lymph node-negative patients. In patients with positive nodes, the ones with AR-positive tumors had significantly better survival rate (P\u003c0.05), and the 5-year survival rate and the median survival time of patients with AR-positive tumors were significantly better than those of patients with AR-negative tumors (89.3% vs. 67.3% and 56 months vs. 37 months). When the patients were classified as two subsets: c-erbB2-negative and c-erbB2-positive, it indicated that AR expression had on impact on prognosis in c-erbB2-negative patients; and in c-erbB2-positive patients, the survival status was significantly better in patients with AR-positive breast cancer, the 5-year survival rate and the median survival time of patients with AR-positive tumors were significantly better than those of patients with AR-negative tumors (80.0% vs. 57.1% and 57 months vs. 37 months).\nThe patients with positive lymph nodes and positive c-erbB2 expression have a poorer prognosis in the female breast cancer patients, and the expression of AR has a prognostic significance in those patients. The patients with AR-positive tumors have a better prognosis than these with AR-negative tumors.","title":"[Evaluation of the prognostic significance of androgen receptor expression in patients with breast cancer].","pubmedId":"21211271"}
