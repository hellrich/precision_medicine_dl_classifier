In the normal esophagus, the parabasal and intermediate cell layers showed a weak expression of hEGF, however, hEGF-positive tumor cells were detected in 62 (92.5 per cent) of the 67 primary esophageal carcinomas and in 18 (94.7 per cent) of the 19 metastatic lymph nodes. In this study, the immunoreactivity of hEGF was classified into 4 grades according to the number of stained tumor cells. A significant correlation was observed between the histologic type and the grade of hEGF immunoreactivity (Chi-square test, p less than 0.01). hEGF immunoreactivity in well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas was significantly higher than in other squamous cell carcinomas, although there were no correlations between other pathological findings and hEGF immunoreactivity. Patients with hEGF immunoreactivities of grades II or III had much worse prognoses than those with grades 0 or I (p less than 0.05). In 22 esophageal carcinomas and 10 normal esophageal mucosae, EGF receptor (EGFR) contents were measured by the competitive binding assay. The average EGFR content (101.3 +/- 35.7 fmol/mg protein, mean +/- SE) of the esophageal carcinomas was significantly higher than that (5.3 +/- 1.2) of the normal esophageal mucosae (p less than 0.05). Moreover, in hEGF negative tumors, EGFR contents were lower than in hEGF positive tumors. These results suggest that hEGF and EGFR show increased production in squamous cell carcinomas and could to be useful prognostic factors in patients with esophageal cancer.","title":"Expression of human epidermal growth factor and its receptor in esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"2193179"}
