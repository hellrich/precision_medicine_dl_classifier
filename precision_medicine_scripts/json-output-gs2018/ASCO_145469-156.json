In a large, prospectively accrued, well-characterized patient (pt) cohort, we examined if quantitative TIL detection contributes to improved outcome predictions and tested if germline variants are associated with TIL grade.  Methods:    We studied 1,241 pts with primary cutaneous melanoma presenting to NYU from 2002-13 (median f/u 3.9 years). TILs were graded as absent, non-brisk or brisk on H\u0026E as previously defined. Association between TIL grade and primary tumor characteristics was analyzed using the Chi square test. Quantitative CD3 and CD45 immunohistochemistry for TILs was performed on a subset of 200 tumors representing the cohort. We examined 365 single nucleotide variants in genes related to melanoma risk and immunomodulation for association with TIL grade in a subset of 607 pts. Hazard ratios (HR) for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) by TIL grade were estimated by Cox models. Logistic regression analyses were used to test the association between germline variants and TIL grade.   Results:    TILs were classified as absent (n \u003d 388, 31%), non-brisk (n \u003d 330, 27%) and brisk (n \u003d 523, 42%) on H\u0026E. Pts with brisk TILs had significantly longer RFS and OS (p \u003d 0.007, HR 0.56; p \u003d 0.0017, HR 0.54, respectively) compared to non-brisk TILs on univariate and multivariate analysis controlling for thickness (p \u003d 0.036). Interestingly, pts with non-brisk TILs had the worst RFS (p \u003d 0.017) and OS (p \u003d 0.008) among all TIL grades. TIL quantitation for CD3, CD45 and the combination did not improve outcome predictions. Two independent germline variants of the BCL10 gene, involved in apoptotic and NF-kappaB pathways, associated with TIL grade, most significantly rs962409 (OR \u003d 2.98, p \u003d 0.0007).   Conclusions:   Presence of TILs is a heterogeneous group and caution in prognostic interpretation is warranted. Studies are underway to characterize T-cell effector and suppressor interactions among TIL subtypes. Identification of germline variants associated with TIL grade suggests that inherited genetic factors may contribute at least in part to TIL grade.","title":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) classifications and association with survival in primary melanomas.","pubmedId":"ASCO_145469-156"}
