The normal range for 500 interphase nuclei was \u003c/\u003d4 (\u003c/\u003d0.8%) nuclei based on 10 bone marrow and 10 blood specimens from normal individuals. The percentage of neoplastic nuclei was usually lower in blood than bone marrow. However, changes in the percentage of neoplastic nuclei in blood and bone marrow tracked closely over the course of therapy and with the results of quantitative cytogenetic studies on bone marrow. This result indicates that D-FISH is useful to test blood from patients with CML to monitor therapy. Moreover, by analysis of 6,000 nuclei with D-FISH, residual disease was identified in bone marrow and blood for patients in complete cytogenetic remission. Consequently, D-FISH analyses of interphase nuclei from blood could substitute for Q-cytogenetic studies on bone marrow. Thus, it may not be necessary to collect bone marrow samples so frequently to monitor therapy in CML.","title":"A special fluorescent in situ hybridization technique to study peripheral blood and assess the effectiveness of interferon therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"9746769"}
