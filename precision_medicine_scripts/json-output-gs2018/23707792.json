Of the cyclin genes, CCNI was the most expressed. Data obtained from microarray and qRT-PCR showed higher expression of CCND1 in diabetic islets. Among the CDKs, CDK4, CDK8 and CDK9 were highly expressed, while CDK1 was expressed at low level. High expression of CDK18 was observed in diabetic islets. Of the CDKIs, CDKN1A expression was higher in diabetic islets in both microarray and qRT-PCR. Expression of CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CCNI2, CDK3 and CDK16 was correlated with age. Finally, eight SNPs in these genes were associated with T2D in the DIAGRAM database. Our data provide a comprehensive expression pattern of cell cycle genes in human islets. More human studies are required to confirm and reproduce animal studies.
