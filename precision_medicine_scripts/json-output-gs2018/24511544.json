Recent whole-genome studies revealed novel GBM prognostic biomarkers such as mutations in metabolic enzyme IDH-isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH1 and IDH2). The distinctive mutation IDH1 R132H was uncovered to be a strong prognostic biomarker for glioma patients. We investigated the prognostic role of IDH1 R132H mutation in GBM patients in West Bohemia.\nThe IDH1 R132H mutation was assessed by the RT-PCR in the tumor samples from 45 GBM patients treated in the Faculty Hospital in Pilsen and was correlated with the progression free and overall survival.\nThe IDH1 R132H mutation was identified in 20 from 44 GBM tumor samples (45.4%). The majority of mutated tumors were secondary GBMs (16 in 18, 89.9%). Low frequency of IDH1 mutations was observed in primary GBMs (4 in 26, 15.3%). Patients with IDH R132H mutation had longer PFS, 136 versus 51 days (P \u003c 0.021, Wilcoxon), and OS, 270 versus 130 days (P \u003c 0.024, Wilcoxon test).\nThe prognostic value of IDH1 R132H mutation in GBM patients was verified. Patients with mutation had significantly longer PFS and OS than patients with wild-type IDH1 and suffered more likely from secondary GBMs.","title":"Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutations as prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma multiforme patients in West Bohemia.","pubmedId":"24511544"}
