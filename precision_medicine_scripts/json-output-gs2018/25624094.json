This impairment of the immune system is believed, at least in part, to underlie the poor outcomes in this patient population. Modulating the immune system to improve cancer outcomes is an attractive concept in this difficult to treat population.\nNew studies have started to unravel the mechanisms of immunosuppression and new therapies are being developed to exploit this new information.","title":"Immunotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25624094"}
