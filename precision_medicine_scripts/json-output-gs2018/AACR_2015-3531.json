KRAS/BRAF-wild type colorectal cancers are sensitive to both cetuximab and panitumumab that are epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting agents. However, KRAS/BRAF-mutant colorectal cancers are resistant to EGFR-targeting agents because of constitutive activation of the EGFR-downstream RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategy is required to improve the clinical outcome in patients with KRAS/BRAF-mutant colorectal cancers. We developed two types of telomerase-specific replication-competent oncolytic adenoviruses, OBP-301 and OBP-702 armed with the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor gene. In this study, we established the companion diagnostics-based selection algorithm for our oncolytic viruses. We compared the antitumor effects of OBP-301 and OBP-702 in human colorectal cancer cells with wild type KRAS/BRAF (SW48, Colo320DM), mutated KRAS (DLD-1, SW620) and mutated BRAF (RKO, HT29). We evaluated the antitumor effect of OBP-301 and OBP-702 in human colorectal cancer cells using XTT assay. Oncolytic adenovirus-mediated induction of apoptosis- and autophagy-related cell death was analyzed by Western blot analysis. KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer cells were sensitive to both OBP-301 and OBP-702 as well as KRAS/BRAF-wild type cells. In contrast, BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer cells were sensitive to OBP-702 rather than OBP-301. Western blot analysis showed that OBP-301 induced autophagy, whereas OBP-702 induced both autophagy and apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that oncolytic viruses should be used according to the genetic background of the RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway, especially in patients with colorectal cancer.","title":"Companion diagnostics-based telomerase-specific oncolytic virotherapy: preclinical evaluation in human colorectal cancer cell lines differentially affected in the RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-3531"}
