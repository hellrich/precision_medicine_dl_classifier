Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of MUC1 and beta-catenin in these tissues. The correlation of the expression of MUC1/beta-catenin with different clinico-pathological parameters of the papillary thyroid carcinoma patients was analyzed.\nThe MUC1 expression level of the tissues of the papillary thyroid carcinoma tissue was (134 +/- 10, gray scale), significantly higher than those of nodular goiter group (101 +/- 7, gray scale) and the control group (99 +/- 6, gray scale) (both P \u003c 0.01). The positive expression rate of MUC1 in the tissues of papillary thyroid carcinoma was 56.6%, significantly higher than those in the nodular goiter and control groups (15.0% and 5.0% respectively, both P \u003c 0.01). The positive beta-catenin expression rate of the papillary thyroid carcinoma group was 71.7%, significantly higher than those of the nodular goiter and control groups (40.0% and 20.0% respectively, both P \u003c 0.05). The positive MUC1 expression rate of the papillary thyroid carcinoma patients with lymph node metastasis was 68.4% (26/38), significantly higher than that of the patients without lymph node metastasis (26.7%, 4/15, P \u003c 0.05), however, there were no significant differences in the MUC1 expression rate among the papillary thyroid carcinoma patients different in sex, age, and tumor size (all P \u003e 0.05). The beta-catenin expression rates of the papillary thyroid carcinoma patients different in sex, age, tumor size, and lymph node metastasis status were not significantly different (all P \u003e 0.05). Binary Logistic regression analysis showed that abnormal expression of MUC1 and beta-catenin were positively correlated with the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (all P \u003c 0.05), and lymph node metastasis status and abnormal expression of beta-catenin were positively correlated with MUC1 expression (P \u003c 0.05).\nPlaying an important role in the carcinogenesis and development of papillary thyroid carcinoma, MUC1 can be used as a biomarker in this carcinoma. There was a significant positive correlation between MUC1 expression and beta-catenin expression.","title":"[Expression of mucin-l and beta-catenin in papillary thyroid carcinoma and the clinical significance thereof].","pubmedId":"19567117"}
