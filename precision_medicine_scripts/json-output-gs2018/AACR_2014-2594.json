Using a 4T1 murine model of breast cancer, a cationic nanoliposomal formulation containing monophosphoryl lipid A and the cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane induced anti-tumor activity following intratumoral administration. Addition of recombinant interleukin-12 (IL-12) further suppressed tumor growth and augmented T helper-1 cell (Th-1) polarization, with enhanced tumor infiltration by cytotoxic T cells, dendritic cells, and M1 macrophages, and amplification of interferon gamma secretion. Mice bearing dual tumors displayed arrest of tumor growth in treated tumors as well as distal, untreated tumors following combination therapy with adjuvant nanoliposomes and IL-12. In summary, adjuvant MPL-liposomes combined with localized IL-12 therapy block tumor growth, stimulate a Th-1 bias of the tumor microenvironment, and induce cancer-specific immune responses.","title":"Adjuvant cationic nanoliposomes induce anti-cancer immunity in a murine model of breast cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2594"}
