These channels can be distinguished by their sensitivity to blockers of the receptor-operated Ca2+ channel, 1-[b-(3-[4-methoxyphenyl]propoxy)-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SK\u0026F 96365) and (R,S)-(3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxy-isoquinoline-1-yl)-2-phenyl-N,N-di-[2-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-acetamide (LOE 908). NSCC-1 is sensitive to LOE 908 and resistant to SK\u0026F 96365, whereas NSCC-2 is sensitive to both LOE 908 and SK\u0026F 96365. Moreover, extracellular Ca2+ influx through these channels plays an essential role in endothelin-1-induced mitogenesis in C6 glioma cells. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of extracellular Ca2+ influx on intracellular pathways of endothelin-1-induced mitogenic responses in C6 glioma cells. We focused on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in this context. An inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase, 2-[2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl]-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (PD 98059), abolished the endothelin-1-induced increase in ERK1/2 activity, but only partially suppressed the mitogenic response. ERK1/2 activation by endothelin-1 was partially suppressed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. On the basis of the sensitivity to LOE 908 and SK\u0026F 96365, Ca2+ influx through NSCC-1 and NSCC-2 plays an essential role in the extracellular Ca2+-dependent component of ERK1/2 activity. In contrast, Ca2+ influx through NSCC-2 is involved in the ERK1/2-independent component of endothelin-1-induced mitogenesis. These results indicate that (1) the endothelin-1-induced mitogenic response involves both ERK1/2-dependent and -independent mechanisms, (2) ERK1/2 activation by endothelin-1 involves an extracellular Ca2+ influx-dependent cascade as well as an extracellular Ca2+ influx-independent cascade, (3) because endothelin-1-induced mitogenesis is completely dependent on extracellular Ca2+ influx, extracellular Ca2+ influx also plays an important role in mitogenic pathways downstream of ERK1/2, (4) extracellular Ca2+ influx through NSCC-1 and NSCC-2 has an important role in the extracellular Ca2+ influx-dependent component of ERK1/2-dependent mitogenesis, (5) extracellular Ca2+ influx through NSCC-2 has an important role in ERK1/2-independent mitogenesis, and (6) Ca2+ influx through each Ca2+ channel may play a distinct role in intracellular mitogenic cascades.","title":"Effects of extracellular Ca2+ influx on endothelin-1-induced intracellular mitogenic cascades in C6 glioma cells.","pubmedId":"11821017"}
