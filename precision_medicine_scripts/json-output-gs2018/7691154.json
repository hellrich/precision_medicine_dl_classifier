Some regions were amplified in almost all specimens, the conserved regions (CRs), and others were differentially amplified in some subsets, the non-conserved regions (NCRs). CRs constituted only 20% of the 330 kb region, with the remainder being NCRs. The regions that inevitably co-segregate with the MYCN gene make up the core, whereas flanking regions are retained at random. If a histogram of the frequency with which the amplified NCR sequences from one specimen match those of the cell line MC-NB-I shows a random distribution, the NCRs would co-segregate with MYCN as a result of random events. However, both the tumors and cell lines/xenografts showed a distribution with two distinct peaks; one from a group containing a small number of sequences with a fairly high degree of homology to the NCRs of MC-NB-I, and the other from a group containing a large number of sequences with little homology. These results indicate that the flanking segments are preferentially co-segregated with MYCN by a non-random mechanism.","title":"Structural organization of MYCN amplicons of neuroblastoma tumors, xenografts, and cell lines characterized by the sequences encompassing the MYCN amplicons in a human neuroblastoma cell line.","pubmedId":"7691154"}
