Several new therapeutic strategies that focus on immuno- and/or targeted therapy have been developed, which have entered clinical trials or already been approved. This review provides an update on prognostic and predictive biomarkers in melanoma that may be used to improve the clinical management of patients. Prognostic markers include conventional histopathological characteristics, chromosomal aberrations, gene expression patterns and miRNA profiles. There is a trend towards multi-marker assays and whole-genome molecular screening methods to determine the prognosis of individual patients. Predictive biomarkers, including targeted components of signal transduction, developmental or transcriptional pathways, can be used to determine patient response towards a particular treatment or combination thereof. The rapid evolution of sequencing technologies and multi-marker screening will change the spectrum of patients who become candidates for therapeutic agents, and in addition create new ethical and regulatory challenges.
