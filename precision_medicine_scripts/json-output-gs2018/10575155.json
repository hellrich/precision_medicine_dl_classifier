Much of the recent work focuses on oncongenes and tumour suppressor genes and the role of apoptosis in melanoma. Loss of tumour suppressor proteins such as p16 has been documented in melanoma and correlates with tumour progression. Mutations in the tumour suppressor p53 have also been documented in melanoma. The proto-oncongene Bcl-2 encodes a protein that inhibits apoptosis. Bcl-2 is found in normal melanocytes and benign nevi. However, lower levels are seen in melanoma. To investigate the relationship between melanoma and nevi, in our Basic and Clinical Science section, Dr. Radhi examines the expression of p53, p16, and Bcl in malignant melanoma arriving in benign nevi. P53 immunoreactivity was found only in the malignant component, with no expression being seen in the benign components of the lesion. This suggests that this tumour suppressor gene is involved in the pathogenesis of melanoma.","title":"The etiology of malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"10575155"}
