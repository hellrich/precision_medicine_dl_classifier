To determine the role of the CDKN2A gene in the development of ovarian adenocarcinomas, we examined a large series of benign, low malignant potential (LMP) and invasive ovarian neoplasms for evidence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), homozygous deletions, point mutations and hypermethylation of the CDKN2A locus. We have previously reported LOH on 9p in 45% of malignant ovarian neoplasms and a smaller percentage of benign and LMP tumours. In the current study, 6 malignant tumours were identified with partial deletions of 9p21. In 5 of these, the CDKN2A gene lays within the minimal deleted region. Homozygous deletions of CDKN2A were observed in only 2/88 invasive ovarian tumours and in 5/11 ovarian cancer cell lines. Of 15 primary ovarian tumours analyzed, one nonsense mutation was identified in a mucinous LMP tumour. No evidence of hypermethylation of the CDKN2A gene was found in 50 primary ovarian adenocarcinomas nor in 3 ovarian cancer cell lines. In conclusion, homozygous deletions, mutations and the de novo methylation of 5\u0027 CpG island are not frequent modes of inactivation of the CDKN2A gene in ovarian cancer. The target of 9p LOH in ovarian adenocarcinomas is therefore unknown.","title":"Rare mutations and no hypermethylation at the CDKN2A locus in epithelial ovarian tumours.","pubmedId":"9052747"}
