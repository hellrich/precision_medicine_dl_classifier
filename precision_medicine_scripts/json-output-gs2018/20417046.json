The antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli was determined using an automatized method (Vitek 2 Biomerieux).\nThe global susceptibility of E. coli was: ampicillin: 57%; amoxicillin+clavulanic acid: 73%; cefixim: 96%; ceftriaxone: 98%; gentamycin: 96%; nalidixic acid: 82%; ciprofloxacin: 89%; fosfomycin: 98%; nitrofurantoin: 96% and cotrimoxazole: 81%. The susceptibility of E. coli to ciprofloxacin was higher in 15- to 65-year-old female patients (94%) than for older female (85%) or male patients (80%).\nIn the Elbeuf area, third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin were the most effective on E. coli isolated from community-acquired urinary tract infections. Fluoroquinolones were more active in 15- to 65-year-old female patients than in male patients and in female patients over 65 years of age. The rates of acquired resistance were related to the level of antibiotic prescription in the various populations.","title":"[Susceptibility to antibiotics of Escherichia coli isolated from community-acquired urinary tract infections].","pubmedId":"20417046"}
