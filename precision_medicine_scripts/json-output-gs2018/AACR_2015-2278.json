We established a highly metastatic subline (HOC313-LM) derived from an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line (HOC313) for uncovering the metastatic mechanisms. We identified deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) as a metastasis-related gene through the specific amplification at 19p13.2-p13.13 in the HOC313-LM. Overexpression of DHPS promoted cell motility, invasion and metastasis through activation of the RhoA signaling pathway, and increased the tumor formation in vivo. We also demonstrated that eukaryotic translation factor 5A (eIF5A) bound to RhoA mRNA and regulated its translation. Moreover, GC7, a DHPS inhibitor, showed significant decrease in the tumor formation in vivo. In patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), overexpression of DHPS in ESCC tumors was significantly associated with worse recurrence-free survival, and correlated with distant metastasis. Our elucidation of these molecular mechanisms within the hypusine cascade suggests opportunities for novel therapeutic targets in SCC.","title":"The hypusine cascade promotes cancer progression and metastasis through the regulation of RhoA in squamous cell carcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2278"}
