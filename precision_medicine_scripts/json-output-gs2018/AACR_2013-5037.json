The most common and potent ALK mutation, ALKF1174L, leads to the constitutive activation of the ALK protein and is associated preferentially with MYCN amplification, a markedly poorer prognosis, and confers resistance to the promising ALK inhibitor crizotinib. The development of more efficacious ALK inhibitors will benefit from non-invasive imaging strategies for the rapid identification of children with high-risk ALK-expressing or mutated neuroblastoma.Intrinsic susceptibility magnetic resonance imaging (IS-MRI) data was acquired from tumors arising in TH-ALKF1174L/TH-MYCN and TH-MYCN mice, two genetically engineered mouse model of high-risk neuroblastoma. The native MRI transverse relaxation rate R2*, an imaging biomarker sensitive to the concentration of paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin, and changes in R2* induced with 100% oxygen inhalation, were quantified. Tumors in the TH-ALKF1174L/TH-MYCN mice demonstrated significantly (p\u003c0.0001) slower native R2* rates (61  3s1, n\u003d23) than tumors in the TH-MYCN mice (101  6s1, n\u003d21). With hyperoxic challenge, the TH-ALKF1174L/TH-MYCN mice demonstrated a significantly (p\u003c0.0001) lower and negligible R2*oxygen-air (-3  1s1, n\u003d10) compared with tumors in TH-MYCN mice (-26  3s1, n\u003d12). A sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 81% for native R2*, and a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 94% for hyperoxia-induced R2* was determined.Histological correlates revealed a significantly (p\u003c0.05) higher uptake of the perfusion marker Hoechst 33342, and the presence of large hemorrhagic blood lakes filled with stagnant deoxygenated erythrocytes, in tumors within the TH-MYCN mice, but not the TH-ALKF1174L/TH-MYCN model. Together these corroborate the IS-MRI findings (relatively fast native R2* and significant R2*, indicative of vascular instability, in tumors in the TH-MYCN mice).IS-MRI provides a robust method to discriminate and identify TH-MYCN transgenic mice harboring the ALKF1174L mutation based on a stark differential vascular phenotype, which may impact on impaired drug delivery. IS-MRI is suitable for the scanning of young children, and quantitation of native R2* easily incorporated into existing pediatric clinical imaging protocols. This approach could provide a robust and rapid indicator of ALK genotypic status of the tumor, enabling the early identification of children with ultra high-risk neuroblastoma at the time of diagnosis.","title":"Intrinsic susceptibility magnetic resonance imaging identifies tumors with ALKF1174L mutation in transgenic murine models of high-risk neuroblastoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-5037"}
