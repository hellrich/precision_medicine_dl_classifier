Cyclin D1 overexpression (for instance as a consequence of CCND1 amplification) might result in loss of control over genetic damage at this point and in an accumulation of chromosomal aberrations. In this work we analyze whether CCND1 amplification is associated with a higher incidence of alterations in cellular DNA content. 31 squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck were studied. CCND1 amplification was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Cellular DNA content was determined by flow cytometry. CCND1 amplification was found in 6 (19%) cases. Thirteen (42%) cases were diploid and 18 (58%) were aneuploid. Two (33%) of the 6 cases with CCND1 amplification were aneuploid compared with 16 (64%) of the cases without CCND1 amplification (P \u003d 0.36). We conclude that CCND1 amplification is not associated to a higher incidence of chromosomal aberrations in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.","title":"[CCND1 oncogene amplification and cellular DNA content in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck].","pubmedId":"11692945"}
