CMV was searched for in the gastroscopic biopsy material because the gastric ulcer had occurred in a setting of CMV mononucleosis. CMV cells were found in gastroscopic biopsy sections and CMV was also cultured from biopsy material. This study illustrates the feasibility of antemortem diagnosis of CMV-associated disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract.","title":"Cytomegalovirus-associated gastric ulcer.","pubmedId":"188711"}
