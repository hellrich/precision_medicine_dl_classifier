Amplification of gene HER-2/neu and overexpression of its gene product have been shown to have both prognostic and treatment implications in breast cancer. The reports concerning the expression of c-erbB2/HER-2/neu in salivary gland tumours are few and controversial. Thus, eleven cases of SDC were evaluated for HER-2/neu status using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular genetic analysis of SDCs using FISH. HER-2/neu overexpression, identified as strong membrane staining, was observed in all but one case of SDC in majority of neoplastic cells while only four tumours, of nine cases analysed, revealed HER-2/neu gene amplification by means of FISH analysis. SDCs were associated with poor clinical outcome, 6 patients (55%) died of disseminated carcinoma within 4 to 44 months after therapy. There was no difference in outcome of patients with IHC positive-nonamplified and IHC positive-amplified tumours.","title":"[Amplification and overexpression of HER-2/neu in parotid gland salivary duct carcinoma.
