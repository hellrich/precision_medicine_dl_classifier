{"genes":["albumin"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Biliary tract cancer is a heterogenous group. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin has been the standard chemotherapy for advanced biliary tract cancer, but there is lack of evidence on treatment in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC). We analyzed 29 patients with only IHC who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin between June 2010 and February 2013. The median age was 63 years (range, 40-78 years), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of all patients was \u003c2. The median progression-free survival and median overall survival (OS) were 4.3 and 7.3 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that platelet count (≤180 × 10 per liter), metastatic site of more than 2, and albumin level (≤3.5 g/dL) were independent prognostic factors for decreased OS. OS was estimated based on the number of adverse prognostic factors: zero or 1 (good prognostic group), 2 (intermediate group), or 3 (poor prognostic group). The median OS for good (n \u003d 15), intermediate (n \u003d 10), and poor (n \u003d 4) prognostic group was 10.5, 6.1, and 1.6 months, respectively (P \u003c 0.005). Relatively better prognosis of the good prognosis group comparing to other prognosis groups can be expected from the prognostic model established in this study by analyzing patients with IHC treated with gemcitabine.","title":"A Prognostic Index to Identify Patients With Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Who Could Benefit From Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin.","pubmedId":"25285672"}
