However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that other pathways must also contribute to this disease. Activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway has been implicated in melanoma by mutations of NRAS and PTEN. Little direct information is known about the activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in melanoma, particularly in metastases. Methods: Proteins isolated from 99 frozen melanoma tumors were measured by reverse phase protein arrays (RRPA). A total of 53 proteins were assessed using validated antibodies. Activating mutations were assessed by mass spectroscopy-based genotyping. Activation of AKT (phospho-AKT) was compared to mutations and anatomic sites. Results: Samples from 75 regional metastases (LN or in-transit) and 24 distant metastases were analyzed. Technical replicates (same lysate) and biological replicates (same tumor, different lysates) demonstrated average Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of \u003e 0.90, supporting the high technical quality of the analysis. A positive correlation was observed between levels of p-AKT and known AKT substrates p-GSK3 and p-TSC2 (p \u003c 0.001 for both), and a negative correlation with PTEN (p \u003c 0.01), supporting the maintenance of phosphorylation events during sample processing. Relative differences in p-AKT by RPPA were also confirmed by immunohistochemistry of representative tumors. Tumors with BRAF mutations had higher levels of p-AKT than tumors with NRAS mutations (p \u003d 0.03). Indeed, tumors with NRAS mutations had p-AKT levels similar to tumors wild-type for BRAF and NRAS (p \u003d0.73). Detailed analysis demonstrated that all tumors with elevated p-AKT had low PTEN expression. Similar results were seen in human melanoma cell lines. Analysis of distant metastases demonstrated that brain metastases had higher levels of p-AKT, p-GSK3, and p-TSC2, and lower levels of PTEN, compared to metastases to the lung or liver. Conclusions: AKT activation in melanoma correlates with PTEN expression, and does not correlate with NRAS mutation. Activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway may contribute to the aggressiveness of brain metastases. These findings have clinical implications for targeting this pathway, and demonstrate the feasibility and potential of RPPA analysis of signaling pathways in melanoma.","title":"Quantitative assessment of AKT activation in melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_34274-65"}
