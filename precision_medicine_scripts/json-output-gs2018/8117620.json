In human sarcomas, amplification of several genes located to the q13-14 region of chromosome 12 has been reported. Because the mdm2 protein seems to inactivate the tumor suppressor protein p53, a selective growth advantage of 12q13-14 amplification has previously been assigned to increased copy number and expression of the MDM2 gene. We have analyzed a panel of 98 human sarcomas of different subtypes to characterize the 12q13-14 amplica and determine which of the genes GLI, A2MR, SAS, MDM2, and GADD153 (CHOP) in this region was most consistently amplified. MDM2 was amplified in 9 of the tumors, SAS in 10, GADD153 in 4, GLI in 2, and A2MR in 2. Amplification was, in most cases, associated with increased expression of the corresponding gene. SAS and MDM2 were coamplified in 8 of the tumors, whereas GADD153, GLI, and A2MR were only amplified together with SAS. One liposarcoma showed amplification of MDM2 alone, whereas two osteosarcomas and a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line showed amplification of SAS and GADD153 (CHOP) but not MDM2. It is suggested that the selective target for these amplica may be an as yet unidentified gene localized between SAS and MDM2.","title":"Mapping of amplification units in the q13-14 region of chromosome 12 in human sarcomas: some amplica do not include MDM2.","pubmedId":"8117620"}
