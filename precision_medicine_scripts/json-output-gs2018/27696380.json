The primary objective was to estimate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate according to the Choi criteria with a target of ≥50%. Cross-sectional imaging was performed before the start of treatment, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 3 months during treatment. The 2- and 5-year survival rates were determined.\nOne hundred sixteen patients were enrolled within 45 months, and 109 began treatment with dasatinib. The 6-month PFS rate and the median PFS were 48% and 5.8 months, respectively. The PFS rate at 6 months was highest with ASPS (62%) and lowest with SFT (30%). More than 10% of the patients with ASPS, CS, or chordoma had stable disease for more than 1 year. Collectively, for all 5 subtypes, the 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 44% and 13%, respectively. An objective response was observed in 18% of the patients with CS or chordoma.\nDasatinib failed to achieve control of sarcoma growth for at least 6 months in more than 50% of the patients in this trial according to the Choi tumor response criteria. An objective tumor response and prolonged stable disease was observed in \u003e10% of patients with CS or chordoma.
