Studies showed that inside exosomes, cellular gene products including proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) are packaged and these molecules can be transferred to recipient cells to deliver their molecular signaling.Objective: To explore the miRNA expression profile and distribution characteristics of exosomes derived from human esophageal cancer cells by Solexa high-throughput sequencing.Methods: Exosomes were extracted from cell culture supernatants by ultracentrifugation. Exosomes were identified by transmission electronic microscopy and western blot assay with anti-CD63 antibody. The types and abundance of known and novel miRNAs in cells and exosomes were identified by Solexa high-throughput sequencing.Results:There were 56421(2.94%) unique sequences in cells and 7727(0.63%) in exosomes matched the known miRNAs(Table 1). 64 in cells and 32 in exosomes novel miRNAs were predicted. Further analysis revealed extensive sequence variations (isomiRs) of cell and exosome miRNAs. The known miRNAs showed an increased expression in cells compared with exosomes. The expression level of hsa-miR-chr15_4885 and hsa-miR-chr18_7463 in exosomes were significantly higher than cells, with an average fold-change of 10 while hsa-miR-chr7_20613 and hsa-miR-chr19_8205 in cells were significantly higher than exosomes, with an average fold-change of thousands.Conclusion: The miRNA expression profile in exosomes is different from that in cells. It suggested that the significantly enriched miRNAs in exosomes may be the result of an active uptaken by exosomes. These specific miRNAs expressed in exosomes may play an important role in intercellular communication.Distribution of sequence counts for the different classes of small RNAs in cells and exosomesCitation Format: Juan Liao, Ran Liu, Lihong Yin.
