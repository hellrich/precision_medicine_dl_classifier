Flow cytometry was carried out using antibodies against CD3; CD3e; CD4; CD5; CD8; CD11a, b, c, and d; CD14; CD21; CD34; CD45 and 45RA; CD79a; CD90 (THY-1); major histocompatibility complex II; myeloperoxidase; MAC387; and neutrophil-specific antibody. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and analyzed for mutations in N, H, and K-RAS, FLT3, and C-KIT genes by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing.\nFifty-seven (77.0%) of 74 samples submitted from dogs with suspected leukemia had cytologically and immunophenotypically confirmed leukemia. There were 36 (63.2%) acute leukemias, 16 (28.1%) chronic, 3 (5.3%) prolymphocytic, 1 natural killer cell, and 1 chronic leukemia undergoing blast transformation. N-RAS mis-sense mutations were identified in 14 (25%) dogs with acute myeloid (AML) or lymphoid (ALL) leukemia, and also in one dog in the leukemic phase of lymphoma. Mutations in K-RAS were found in two dogs with AML. There were no H-RAS mutations. FLT3 internal tandem duplications were identified in three dogs with ALL, and a mis-sense mutation was found in one dog with ALL. C-KIT mutations were identified in three dogs with AML. Sixty-one percent of dogs with acute leukemia harbored mutations in N/K-RAS, FLT3, or C-KIT.\nRAS, FLT3, and C-KIT mutations, analogous to those found in human leukemia, occur commonly in acute canine leukemia.","title":"RAS, FLT3, and C-KIT mutations in immunophenotyped canine leukemias.","pubmedId":"18977066"}
