Glioma-derived IDH1 mutations have been shown to dominantly inhibit IDH1 catalytic activity, resulting in increased conversion of 2-hydroglutarate (2-HG) from -ketoglutarate and higher HIF-1 levels. We have previously shown that increased HIF-1 expression in NK-AML samples predicted for poor clinical outcome (Deeb et al Leukemia Research Dec 2010 Epub). Here we examined the IDH1 and IDH2 mutational status of 81 adult NK-AML marrow samples previously characterized for expression of HIF-1 and its downstream target VEGF-A.  Methods:  Genomic DNA was extracted from marrow mononuclear cells from diagnostic AML samples. High-throughput DNA sequence analysis (PyroMark Q24 Pyrosequencer, Qiagen) performed with custom-designed primers for IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R140 and R172 mutations was used. HIF-1 and VEGF-A expression in AML cells was determined by immunohistochemistry (see Deeb et al, Leukemia Research online 2010) and RQ-PCR analysis.  Results:  Among these 81 NK-AML samples, 6 (7.4%) contained IDH1-mutations, most in R132H (n\u003d4). Eleven samples (13.6%) contained IDH2-mutations, all in R140Q. IDH1-mutated AML samples expressed higher mean  SEM levels of HIF-1 (3018% vs. 102.7%) and VEGF-A (6214 vs. 283.5%) protein expression and higher HIF-1 gene (6.93.5 vs. 4.00.5 fold) expression than IDH1 wildtype samples. In contrast, IDH2-mutated AML samples expressed no detectable HIF-1 protein and lower VEGF-A protein and HIF-1 gene levels than IDH2 wildtype samples. No differences in age, survival, presenting white blood cell count, or marrow blasts was noted based on IDH1/2 status.  Conclusions:  Our data suggest a potential association between IDH1 mutations and higher HIF-1 and VEGF-A protein expression in AML cells as compared with IDH1 wild-type cells. These results imply that HIF-1 mediated effects may play a role in the leukemogenic effects of IDH1 (but not IDH2) mutations. How HIF-1 expression impacts on metabolic or oxidative stress responses in IDH1-mutated AML warrants further exploration.","title":"Association of IDH1 mutations in normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia samples with higher HIF-1 and VEGF-A expression.","pubmedId":"ASCO_82861-102"}
