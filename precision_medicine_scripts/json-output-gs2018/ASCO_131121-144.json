We sought to evaluate the association between MET gene copy number (GCN) and protein expression in NSCLC samples. Moreover, we wanted to analyze the heterogeneity within the same tumor specimen and its implications in Met evaluation.  Methods:  First, surgical cases from patients with nsNSCLC were included in a tissue microarray (TMA) representing 2 distinct morphologic areas of the tumor (2 consecutive sections). Second, biopsies from newly diagnosed patients were analyzed. Met expression was assessed by IHC (Ventana) using H-scores and MetMAb criteria and MET GCN by FISH (MET and CEP7 probes from Vysis). Association between GCN and protein expression and their correlation with clinico-pathologic and molecular information (KRAS, EGFR) was investigated. Additionally, heterogeneity of METGCN and protein expression within different tumor cores and within consecutive sections was assessed.  Results:  One hundred and twenty-seven samples (120 patients) were analyzed. Ninety percent were adenocarcinomas, 35% grade 3, 19% KRAS and 11% EGFR mutant.  Median age was 66 years, 70% males, and 53% current smokers. Median Met H-score was 140 and according to MetMAb criteria, 48% were Met high. High Met expression was associated with advanced stage (p\u003d0.001). No association was observed with KRAS/EGFR mutations. MET amplification was observed in 8 cases (6.3%). No association was observed between MET GCN and protein expression. Met IHC score was high (H-score 400) in amplified cases with MET/CEP7 ratio \u003e2, but not in those with MET GCN\u003e5.  For Met IHC, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.8 between consecutive tumor sections and 0.4 between different tumor cores. For METFISH, ICC was 0.5 and 0.7, respectively. For amplified cases, 4 out of 12 cores were negative by FISH.  Conclusions:  The definition of Met positivity in the clinical setting is challenging, due to tumor heterogeneity. Met IHC does not accurately identify Met driven tumors. More precise criteria are needed for defining Met dependence.","title":"Met heterogeneity evaluation by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsNSCLC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_131121-144"}
