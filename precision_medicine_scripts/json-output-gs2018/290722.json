Total cholesterol, phospholipid, and fatty acid composition was determined on each cell type. The leukemic cells showed decreased total cholesterol and cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio, increase phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol, decreased phosphatidylethanolamine, and an increased percentage of unsaturated fatty acids when compared to normal mature neutrophils. A nearly identical pattern was seen in the normal immature myeloid precursors from normal bone marrow. We conclude that the altered lipid composition of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells is related to unexplained factors related to cell age and not to malignancy per se.","title":"Cholesterol, phospholipids, and fatty acids of normal immature neutrophils: comparison with acute myeloblastic leukemia cells and normal neutrophils.","pubmedId":"290722"}
