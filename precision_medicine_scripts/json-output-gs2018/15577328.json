Forty-four patients with cutaneous melanoma were investigated. Serum samples were obtained on first admission before adjuvant and metastatic treatment were given and at follow-up. Serum bcl-2 and survivin levels were determined using enzyme immunometric assay (EIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The baseline serum bcl-2 levels were significantly higher in patients with melanoma than in the control group (P\u003d0.01). For the serum survivin levels, no difference was found (P\u003d0.6). No significant correlations were found between the prognostic parameters analysed and the serum survivin concentrations. The same was true of the serum bcl-2 values, except for the age of the patient (P\u003d0.025) and nodal involvement (P\u003d0.003). No significant relationship was found between the serum levels of bcl-2 and survivin (r\u003d-0.13, P\u003d0.4). In node-positive patients (n\u003d8) both of these anti-apoptotic substances were unchanged after interferon-alpha-2b therapy. However, serum survivin concentrations were significantly increased in 10 patients with metastatic melanoma who underwent dacarbazine (DTIC)-based cytotoxic chemotherapy (P\u003d0.047). A similar finding was not determined for the serum bcl-2 levels. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that decreased apoptosis is associated partly with an increase in serum bcl-2. However, much research continues in this field, and exciting new knowledge will ultimately emerge.","title":"Serum bcl-2 and survivin levels in melanoma.","pubmedId":"15577328"}
