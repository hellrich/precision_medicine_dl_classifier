At 3 months BCR-ABL1/ABL1 IS \u003e1% and \u003c10% was associated with a lower likelihood of subsequent MR4.5 compared to patients with lower levels (p \u003d 0.018). No significant difference was observed between methodologies in identifying MMR. Nilotinib induces high molecular response rates in ECPCML and the Xpert BCR-ABL Monitor™ system merits further investigation in this setting.","title":"Nilotinib 300 mg BID as frontline treatment of CML: prospective analysis of the Xpert BCR-ABL monitor system and significance of 3-month molecular response.","pubmedId":"24333114"}
