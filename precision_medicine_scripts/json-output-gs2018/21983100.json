However, an association between the methylation status of TFPI-2 gene and prognosis has not yet been investigated.\nMethylation of TFPI-2 gene was examined in a consecutive series of 133 non-metastatic NSCLC patients using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate the association between clinical variables and overall survival time.\nMethylation of TFPI-2 gene was detected in 36 of 133 patients (27.1%). Of these 36 patients, seventeen individuals (47.2%) carried stage III tumors. The 5-year disease free survival rate among patients carrying methylated TFPI-2 tumors was significantly lower as compared to those with unmethylated TFPI-2 tumors (35.5% versus 6.1%, P\u003c0.0001). Moreover, methylation of TFPI-2 gene was found to be an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival based on multivariate analysis models (P\u003d0.013), as was age \u003e62 years old (P\u003c0.0001) and TNM stage of disease (P\u003c0.0001).\nThe results of the present study suggest that methylation of TFPI-2 gene is an independent factor for an unfavorable prognosis in patients with NSCLC.","title":"TFPI-2 methylation predicts poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21983100"}
