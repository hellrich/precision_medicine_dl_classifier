Here, we investigated the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation by real-time quantitative PCR and KIT mutations (exons 11 and 17) by sequencing analysis in 33 AMs. AMs included \u0027truly\u0027 amelanotic lesions (n \u003d 19), with no melanin pigmentation upon dermoscopic inspection and hypomelanotic lesions (n \u003d 14), by definition partially pigmented lesions showing a melanin pigmentation area of less than 25% of the total surface area. The frequency of the BRAF(V600E) mutation was 70.3% in the 33 cases, a percentage that increased to 89% when only the subgroup of thin melanomas (â‰¤ 1 mm in thickness, n \u003d 9) was considered. KIT mutations were found in 12.1% of AMs, all of which developed in nonacral sites. The identification of a relatively high frequency of BRAF(V600E) and KIT mutations in AMs may have important consequences for implementation of the novel targeted therapies now available to treat this life-threatening disease.","title":"BRAF and KIT somatic mutations are present in amelanotic melanoma.","pubmedId":"23938765"}
