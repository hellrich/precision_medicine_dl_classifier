Expression of the cytoskeleton protein VASP is upregulated in various cancer entities. We analyzed the role of VASP for melanoma growth in murine allograft models. Growth of VASP expressing melanomas was retarded in VASP(-/-) versus wild-type animals. Over time tumor size was \u003c50% in VASP(-/-) versus wild-type animals and independent of expression levels of Ena/VASP protein family members. Histological analyses showed smaller cells with impaired nutrition status and less vascularization in melanomas derived from VASP(-/-) versus counterparts from wild-type mice. Cumulatively, the data reveal a critical role of VASP in non-tumor cells in the tumor environment for melanoma growth in vivo.","title":"Impaired melanoma growth in VASP deficient mice.","pubmedId":"21762694"}
