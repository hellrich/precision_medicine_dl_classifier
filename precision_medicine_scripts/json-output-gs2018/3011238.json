The tumors were composed of four major cell types; intercalated duct, myoepithelial, secretory, and pluripotential reserve/stem cells. The cellular composition of adenoid cystic carcinoma is similar to that in the \"terminal tubule\" complex stage of a developing salivary gland except that in the tumor the pluripotential reserve/stem cells differentiate predominantly along the intercalated duct cell line rather than secretory cells as in the acinic cell carcinoma. Furthermore, adenoid cystic carcinoma appears to contain a far greater number of myoepithelial cells than acinic cell carcinomas.","title":"Histogenesis of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary glands.
