The mechanism for this variation is unknown. In this study, we evaluated whether PTCH variants mediate this phenomenon. We used negative binomial regression analysis to identify associations between BCC numbers/year and host characteristics, parameters of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), and PTCH exon 12(1686) C/T, intron 15(2560+9) G/C, and exon 23(3944) C/T genotypes and haplotypes in 279 BCC cases who presented with an initial tumor on the head/neck. PTCH genotypes were not significantly associated with BCCs/year, although cases with two copies of the C1686-C3944 haplotype developed significantly fewer BCCs/year than those without this haplotype (rate ratio \u003d 0.44; 95% CI \u003d 0.27-0.71). Cases with one copy of T1686-T3944 developed more BCCs/year (rate ratio \u003d 2.46; 95% CI \u003d 1.27-3.97) than those without the haplotype. We found no significant associations between BCCs/year and the other PTCH haplotypes studied. We reexamined the association of C1686-C3944 with BCCs/year in a model that included UVR exposure parameters (sunburning in childhood, sunbathing score, intermittency of exposure between 40 and 60 years of age, exposure in hours/year) and skin type, gender, and age at first presentation. The association between C1686-C3944 and BCCs/year remained significant (rate ratio \u003d 0.44; 95% CI \u003d 0.26-0.73 for two copies of the haplotype). The data show that allelic variation in PTCH contributes to the rate of development of BCC.","title":"PTCH polymorphism is associated with the rate of increase in basal cell carcinoma numbers during follow-up: preliminary data on the influence of an exon 12-exon 23 haplotype.","pubmedId":"15534865"}
