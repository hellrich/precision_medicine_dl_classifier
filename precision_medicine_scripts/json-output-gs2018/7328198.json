The Hemoccult screening protocol has serious weaknesses. It is at best 83% sensitive for cancer and much less sensitive for polyps. An asymptomatic person with one or more positive Hemoccult slides only has a 12% chance of having cancer. In addition, patient acceptance of mass Hemoccult screening is questionable. There is currently little information on potential survival benefits, and Hemoccult screening is expensive with one quarter of all costs incurred in the diagnostic evaluation of false positives. There is insufficient evidence to recommend Hemoccult colorectal cancer screening in asymptomatic persons as a cost-effective practice.","title":"Colorectal cancer screening.","pubmedId":"7328198"}
