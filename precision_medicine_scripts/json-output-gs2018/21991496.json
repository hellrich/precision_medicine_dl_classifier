{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Pleomorphic carcinoma is a rare aggressive type of lung cancer that uncommonly metastasizes to the bowel, leading to bleeding, perforation, obstruction, and rarely intussusception. Serving as a lead point, metastatic lesions in the bowel may precipitate intussusception and require immediate surgical intervention. We present a rare case of colonic metastases from a primary lung malignancy, causing ileocecal intussusception in a 57-year old male.","title":"Colonic metastases from pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung presenting as an ileocecal intussusception.","pubmedId":"21991496"}
