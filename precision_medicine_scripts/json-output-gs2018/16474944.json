This malignant tumor often mimics granuloma or nodular fasciitis, which causes a delay in establishing the diagnosis. This type of cancer has a high recurrence rate. Surgical treatment requires wide radical resection. The objective of this case report is to highlight the unique location of a rare neoplasm and to illustrate the relentless course of epithelioid sarcoma despite initial radical resection. A 14-year-old boy was admitted to our facility with a soft tissue mass on the right lower thoracic spine. The large tumor mass had deeply penetrated into the muscles, infiltrated the neuroforamen of T9-T10 level, and compressed the dural sac. Immunohistological study of the biopsy was highly consistent with an epithelioid sarcoma. Wide excision of the mass, laminectomy and spine fusion with instrumentation was performed. The patient received chemotherapy and irradiation. The first recurrence of the neoplasm was seen as a contralateral metastasis 21 months after the resection. On the last follow-up, 3 years postoperatively, the patient was in a good general condition. However, further progression of the sarcoma had to be recognized. Our case encompasses multiple features that represent negative prognostic factors. Initial wide excision of the neoplasm and adjuvant therapy including chemotherapy and irradiation seem to slow down the relentless course of epithelioid sarcoma in the trunk.","title":"Epithelioid sarcoma in the thoracic spine.","pubmedId":"16474944"}
