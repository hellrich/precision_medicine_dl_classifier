The signal intensity of the IMCCs on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) MRI was qualitatively analyzed by two radiologists, and categorized into intermediate or hypointense groups. Analysis of clinicopathological prognostic factors and correlations of imaging and histology were also performed. Survival time and time to recurrence (TTR) were analyzed.\nOf the 41 IMCCs, 23 were in the intermediate group and 18 were in the hypointense group on HBP MRI. IMCCs in the intermediate group were associated with shorter survival time (P \u003d 0.048) and TTR (P \u003d 0.002) than the IMCCs of the hypointense group. Only the intermediate group on HBP MRI had a significantly shorter TTR on multivariate analysis (P \u003d 0.012). The IMCCs of the intermediate group showed a tendency for more abundant tumour fibrous stroma than those of the hypointense group (P \u003d 0.027).\nThe enhancement of IMCCs on HBP gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI appears to correlate with tumour aggressiveness and outcomes due to the tumour fibrous stromal component. Thus, HBP images could be a useful prognostic factor for IMCCs after surgery.\n• The enhancement of IMCCs on HBP correlates with the tumour fibrous stroma. • The enhancement of IMCCs on HBP MRI appears to correlate with prognosis. • Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI is helpful for predicting prognosis of IMCCs after surgery.","title":"Intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma: prognostic value of preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.","pubmedId":"26002136"}
