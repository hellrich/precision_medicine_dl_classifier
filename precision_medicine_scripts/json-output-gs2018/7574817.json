Treatment consisted of initial administration of 5\u0027-DFUR (po), followed by frequent administration of low-dose epirubicin (20 mg/body once every 2 weeks iv). This resulted in disappearance of the pulmonary metastases and a striking decrease in the AFP level. Case 2 was a 68-year-old male with multiple pulmonary metastases after surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment with 5-FU (iv; once a week) and epirubicin (20 mg/body once every 2 weeks iv) resulted in disappearance of the pulmonary metastases and a marked decrease in the AFP level. It was concluded that administration of epirubicin in frequent, low doses is a useful method for the treatment of pulmonary metastasis after surgery for liver cancer, and it can be safely performed even on an outpatient basis.","title":"[Efficacy of treatment with frequent and low-dose epirubicin in two cases of pulmonary metastases after surgery of liver cancer].","pubmedId":"7574817"}
