Methods: A 49 yo woman with ULMS developed rapidly progressive metastatic disease 4 months after R1-resection of the primary tumor and was enrolled on a phase 1b study of pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 wks) (KEYNOTE-028). Tumor regression at multiple metastatic sites occurred within 2 months. A single pre-existing metastasis increased in size and was resected at 9 months. IHC, whole exome/transcriptome sequencing, and neoantigen analysis was performed on primary pretreatment (preRx) and treatment-resistant tumors (postRx). Results: Responsive tumor sites revealed complete pathologic response at time of surgery. Progressive tumor demonstrated viable ULMS. IHC showed tumor cells negative for PD-L1 and positive for PD-L2 both preRx and postRx. Degree of PD-1+ lymphocyte infiltration decreased significantly postRx compared to preRx. PreRx harbored exomic focal MYC amplification, TP53 nonsense mutation, and heterozygous PTEN deletion. PostRx maintained these genomic alterations and acquired a loss-of-function mutation in PTEN that resulted in biallelic PTEN inactivation. PreRx tumor expressed tumor-specific neoantigens (TSNs) that were immunogenic to patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells; expression of TSNs decreased postRx. Conclusions: This patient exhibited complete pathologic response to pembrolizumab at all but one metastatic ULMS site. Genomic analysis of the resistant tumor revealed acquired bialllelic PTEN loss - recently implicated in resistance to PD-1 inhibition in melanoma and glioblastoma  reduced infiltration of PD-1+ lymphocytes, and diminished expression of neoantigens. To our knowledge, this is the first report of exceptional response to PD-1 inhibition in ULMS, and highlights biallelic PTEN loss and neoantigen downregulation as potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade across cancer types.","title":"Response and oligoclonal resistance to pembrolizumab in uterine leiomyosarcoma: Genomic, neoantigen, and immunohistochemical evaluation.","pubmedId":"ASCO_166429-176"}
