We describe herein our device for advanced esophageal cancer associated with early gastric cancer in the antrum. A 57-year-old man presenting with dysphagia and upper abdominal pain was admitted to our hospital. Preoperative examinations revealed locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the middle thoracic esophagus (T3N0M0 Stage IIA) and mucosal signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gastric antrum (T1N0M0 Stageâ€…IA). Although the gastric tumor appeared to be an intramucosal carcinoma, its margin was obscure, so endoscopic en-bloc resection was considered inadequate. We chose surgical resection of the gastric tumor as well as the esophageal SCC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin for advanced esophageal cancer. Following transthoracic esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection, the gastric carcinoma was removed by gastric antrectomy, which preserved the right gastroepiploic vessels, and a pedunculated short gastric tube was used as the esophageal substitute. Twenty-eight months after the surgery, the patient is well with no evidence of cancer recurrence. Because it minimizes surgical stress and organ sacrifice, gastric tube interposition is a potentially useful technique for esophageal cancer associated with localized early gastric cancer.","title":"Pedunculated gastric tube interposition in an esophageal cancer patient with prepyloric adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"21603033"}
