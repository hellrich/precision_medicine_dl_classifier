Early studies have shown promising results of PD-1 axis blockers and diverse trials using PD-1 monotherapy or combinations are ongoing. However, the expression of PD-L1, additional potentially actionable immune targets and immune infiltration remain poorly understood. Methods: Using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF), we measured the levels of PD-L1, B7-H3, B7-H4 and different tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subsets in 90 SCLC samples represented in tissue microarray format from 2 retrospective collections (YTMA57 and YTMA259). Tumor PD-L1 (clone E1L3N), B7-H3 (D9M2L) and B7-H4 (D1M8I) were detected in serial sections. The major TIL subsets were determined using multiplex staining of the markers DAPI, cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), CD3 (E272), CD8 (C8/144B) and CD20 (L26). Associations between the marker levels, major clinico-pathological variables and survival were established. Results: PD-L1 protein was detected in 7.3%, B7-H3 in 64.9% and B7-H4 in 2.6% of SCLC cases. PD-L1 and B7-H3 showed limited co-expression and a mutually exclusive expression pattern. In preliminary analysis using the median score as cutpoint, expression of the markers was not significantly associated with age, stage, TILs or 5-year overall survival. In SCLC, the levels of CD3, CD8 and CD20 were significantly lower than in lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. The ratio of CD8/CD3 signal was also prominently lower in SCLC. Conclusions: PD-L1 and B7-H4 are infrequently expressed in SCLC. B7-H3 is present in nearly 65% of cases and shows limited co-expression with PD-L1. Despite having a high mutational rate, the level of TILs in SCLC is low, suggesting prominent immune regulation/suppression in this malignancy. Our findings support the blockade of B7-H3 and immune regulatory pathways as candidate immunotherapeutic alternatives in SCLC. Validation of the findings in an independent SCLC population is ongoing.","title":"Objective measurement and significance of PD-L1, B7-H3, B7-H4 and TILs in Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_170891-176"}
