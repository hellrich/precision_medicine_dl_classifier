The following clinicopathologic variables were evaluated: age, gender, histologic type, tumor site, Breslow thickness, Clark\u0027s level, ulceration, and survival period. Statistical analyses were performed for assessment of associations and melanoma-specific survival.\nThe expression of c-Kit, p-ERK, and cyclin D1 was significantly higher in primary melanomas than in nevi. c-Kit immunoreactivity was highest in thin (Tis-pT2) melanomas, and showed a significant reduction with tumor progression and metastasis. The expression of p-ERK was high in all stages of melanoma. Cyclin D1 positivity increased significantly according to tumor progression, but decreased in metastases. A significant correlation between p-ERK and cyclin D1 expression was observed. Survival analysis failed to detect any trends towards shorter or longer survival among patients expressing either c-Kit, p-ERK or cyclin D1.\nThe expression of c-Kit, p-ERK, and cyclin D1 might help to differentiate thin melanoma from melanocytic nevus, but it appears to lack prognostic potential.","title":"Expression of c-Kit, p-ERK and cyclin D1 in malignant melanoma: an immunohistochemical study and analysis of prognostic value.","pubmedId":"21454057"}
