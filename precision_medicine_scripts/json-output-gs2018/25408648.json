Their use results in various cutaneous side effects, such as the development of keratoacanthomas and squamous cell carcinomas. We report a patient with metastatic melanoma treated with vemurafenib who developed dozens of histologically confirmed epidermal cysts within 2 months after initiation of vemurafenib administration. The cystic lesions were observed only in the localized area where a large exophytic melanoma tumor mass had been previously irradiated. Localized epidermal cysts may constitute an unusual radiation recall reaction in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors.
