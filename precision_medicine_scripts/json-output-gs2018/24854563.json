Next to adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung is the most frequent histologic subtype in non-small cell lung cancer. Several molecular alterations have been defined as \"driver oncogenes\" responsible for both the initiation and maintenance of the malignancy. The squamous cell carcinoma of the lung has recently shown peculiar molecular characteristics which relate with both carcinogenesis and response to targeted drugs. So far, about 40% of lung squamous cell carcinoma has been found harbouring driver oncogenes, in which fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays important roles. In this review, we will report the mainly advances on some latest driver mutations of squamous cell lung cancer.\n肺癌在癌症相关死亡中是居于首位的恶性肿瘤。鳞癌是仅次于腺癌的非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）最常见的组织学类型。一些负责恶性肿瘤的发生和维持相关分子改变被称为驱动基因。近来研究证实肺鳞癌也具有与致癌作用及靶向药物疗效有关的独特分子特征。目前发现约40%肺鳞癌已经找到驱动基因，其中纤维母细胞生长因子受体1（fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, FGFR1）起重要作用。本文将对肺鳞癌驱动基因进行综述。","title":"[Advances on driver oncogenes of squamous cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"24854563"}
