To date, an association between Ki-1-positive lymphoma and disseminated intravascular coagulation has not been described, but cases of malignant histiocytosis with disseminated intravascular coagulation have been reported. We report a case of anaplastic, Ki-1-positive, large-cell lymphoma complicated by clinical and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation with histologic evidence of vascular invasion and fibrin thrombi.","title":"Large-cell anaplastic (Ki-1-positive) lymphoma complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation.","pubmedId":"1847037"}
