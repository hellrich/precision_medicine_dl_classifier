The aims of this study are to assess the clinical characteristics of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer in young patients and evaluate the long-term therapeutic outcomes and prognostic factors for cancer mortality and recurrence.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of 116 patients aged ≤20 years who underwent thyroidectomy and a mean follow-up of 11.1 ± 0.6 years.\nThere were 28 (24.1%) patients classified into the residual cancer or relapse groups. The progression-free survival rate for the young patients was lower than that of the patients between 20 and 45 years of age; however, the difference between the thyroid cancer survival rates was not statistically different. Two of the 28 patients died of thyroid cancer. Thirteen patients who showed relapsed underwent (131)I whole-body scan; 6 of the 13 patients were diagnosed with distant metastases to the lung and 1 was diagnosed with distant metastases to the bones. Among the young patients, the 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates were 79.1 and 73.4%, respectively, and the corresponding cancer survival rates were 99.1, and 96.5%, respectively.\nThe progression-free survival in young patients with papillary and follicular thyroid cancer was lower than the patients of age 20-45 years; otherwise, cancer survival was higher than age group over or equal to 45 years.","title":"Therapeutic outcome and prognosis in young patients with papillary and follicular thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"22274547"}
