We investigate the frequency of MET overexpression coexisting with oncogenic drivers and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).   Methods: We screened 806 consecutive NSCLC patients for the presence of MET overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), in which  50% tumor cells with moderate to high intensity staining were defined as MET positive. MET amplification and ALK rearrangements were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and FISH positive was defined as gene focal amplification or high polysomy (at least 15% cells with  5 copy numbers). Meanwhile, KRAS and EGFRmutations were tested by DNA sequencing or Scorpion amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS).  Results: The frequency of MET overexpression was 31.9% (257/806) in NSCLC. Among c-MET positive patients, the frequency of EGFR mutation was 38.1% (98/257) and that of ALK rearrangement was 8.7% (22/257). Response rate (RR) of EGFR-TKIs was 22.2% (8/36) in advanced NSCLC patients with concomitant EGFR mutation and c-MET overexpression, and 56.8% (21/37) in those with only EGFR mutation, P\u003d 0.033. However, there was no significant difference in RR between the patients with concomitant ALK rearrangement and c-MET overexpression and those with only ALK rearrangement, 61.5% (8/13) vs. 75.0% (6/8), P\u003d 0.656. Among 2 cases with concomitant MET amplification and EGFR mutations, one responded to gefitinib, but the other had stable disease. Dramatic response was observed in one with concomitant MET amplification and KRAS mutations.  Conclusions: Advanced NSCLC patients with concomitant EGFR mutation and MET overexpression have significantly low RR with EGFR-TKIs, indicating that MET overexpression  potentially causes intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Similar response was observed in ALK positive patients with or without c-MET overexpression treated with crizotinib.","title":"Response to tyrosine kinase inhibtors in non-small-cell lung cancer with concomitant c-MET overexpression and driver genes.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150866-156"}
