All patients had follow-up for at least 2 years. No patients were lost to follow-up.\nThe overall survival rate was 45% and the disease-specific survival rate was 67% at 5 years after initial diagnosis of carcinoma of the head and neck mucosal sites. Seventy-seven patients (7%) presented with synchronous carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites and 103 patients (9%) developed metachronous carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites at 0.6 to 21.7 years (median, 3.6 years). The overall survival rate was 31%, and the disease-specific survival rate was 50% at 5 years after metachronous carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites. Seven patients (1%) developed metachronous carcinomas of the thoracic esophagus at 1 to 11.1 years (median, 2.8 years), 15 patients (1%) presented with synchronous carcinomas of the lung, and 83 patients (7%) developed metachronous carcinomas of the lung at 0.6 to 17.6 years (median, 3.5 years).\nDevelopment of synchronous and metachronous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites are in part responsible for failure to improve overall survival rates for patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites, justifying rigorous follow-up and studies on chemoprevention.","title":"Synchronous and metachronous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites.","pubmedId":"11230479"}
