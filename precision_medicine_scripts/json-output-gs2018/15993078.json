These compounds were prepared by S(N)Ar reaction of 5-chloro-4-hydroxy-8-nitroquinazoline with alkyl or aryl amines, or alkyl alcohol as nucleophiles. Although the enzyme assay showed a weak inhibition effect against both EGFR and ErbB-2 tyrosine kinases, the cell-based antitumor activity turned out promising. Compounds having 5-anilino substituent exhibit high potency with 5-(4-methoxy)anilino-4-hydroxy-8-nitroquinazoline (1h) being the best dual EGFR/ErbB-2 inhibitors, which effectively inhibited the growth of both EGFR (MDA-MB-468, IC(50)\u003c0.01microM) and ErbB-2 (SK-BR-3, IC(50)\u003d13microM) overexpressing human tumor cell lines in vitro. More interestingly, the variation of the substituent(s) at the 3- and/or 4-position of the 5-anilino portion was found to modulate the selectivity and potency dramatically. However, compounds having an alkylamino or alkyloxy group at the 5-position of 4-hydroxy-8-nitroquinazolines are essentially inactive. These results are consistent with molecular modeling observations. This study was the first attempt to identify new structural types of dual EGFR/ErbB-2-related signaling inhibitors by incorporation of the anilino group at the 5-position of 4-hydroxy-8-nitroquinazolines\u0027 core structure, providing promising new templates for further development of potent inhibitors targeting both EGFR and ErbB-2 tyrosine kinases.","title":"Synthesis and antitumor evaluation of novel 5-substituted-4-hydroxy-8-nitroquinazolines as EGFR signaling-targeted inhibitors.","pubmedId":"15993078"}
