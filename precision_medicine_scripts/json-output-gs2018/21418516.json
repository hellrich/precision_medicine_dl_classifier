Therefore, the development of an alternative approach replacing the traditional therapy is urgently needed. To assess the killing efficiency of the functionally identified apoptosis-related protein (APR)-1 in melanoma cells, we established a system for the regulated expression of APR-1. The induction of APR-1 expression caused apoptosis of melanoma cells via the interaction with the juxtamembrane region of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), and possible also via the competition with tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) and the catalytic receptor of neurotrophin (Trk) for the same p75NTR interacting site. The accumulation of APR-1 in melanoma cells may block the physical association of p75NRT with TRAF6 and/or Trk, leading to the disruption of both NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Also, accumulation of APR-1 protein enhanced the activity of both c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways. However, the analysis of APR-1-modulated pathways demonstrated the involvement of apoptosis-regulating kinase 1-JNK/p38 pathway in the induction of Bax expression leading to both mitochondrial dysregulation [as demonstrated by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of both cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor into cytoplasm, and cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)] and endoplasmic reticulum stress as demonstrated by the increase of intracellular Ca(2+)  release. Thus, besides the analysis of its pro-apoptotic function, our data provide insight into the molecular mechanism of APR-1-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells.","title":"Apoptosis related protein-1 triggers melanoma cell death via interaction with the juxtamembrane region of p75 neurotrophin receptor.","pubmedId":"21418516"}
