Herein, we describe a case of infant AML with EMI in multiple sites. She had dyspnea and hypofibrinogenemia at diagnosis, and systemic computed tomography revealed EMI in the orbit, gingiva, bronchial pathway, and urinary tract. Bone marrow examination confirmed the diagnosis of AML with t(1;10)(p34;p15). No case of AML with t(1;10)(p34;p15) has been reported in the literature. At the present time, she remains free of disease 12 months after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in the second complete remission.","title":"Translocation (1;10)(p34;p15) in infant acute myeloid leukemia with extramedullary infiltration in multiple sites.","pubmedId":"19596261"}
