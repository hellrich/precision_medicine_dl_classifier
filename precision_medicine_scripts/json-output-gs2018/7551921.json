In the same period of time there has been an explosion in the knowledge on the processes of cellular transformation, tumour progression, invasion and metastasis. The major categories of biological events implicated in non-small cell lung cancer include growth factor receptors expression (epidermal growth receptor, p185c-neu), autocrine growth factor production (transforming growth factor alpha), dominant oncogenes activation (ras genes) and deletion of tumour suppressor genes (p53 gene, retinoblastoma gene) and these are some of the abnormalities associated with specific histological types and with poor prognosis. Additional prognostic information can be obtained from the evaluation of the ploidy and proliferative activity of the tumours, carbohydrate antigens expression, presence of neuroendocrine differentiation and the evaluation of markers of the sequential steps involved in the process of tumour dissemination.","title":"Biological prognostic factors in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"7551921"}
