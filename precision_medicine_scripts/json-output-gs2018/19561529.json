Logistic regression models including age, sex, family history of gastric cancer, residency during childhood, smoking, monthly income, spicy food diet and H. pylori status were evaluated to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of developing gastric cancer.\nAdjusted OR for gastric cancer increased 3-fold for subjects reporting first-degree relatives with gastric cancer [OR 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.83-4.46]. The association was strong in the 40 to 59 years age group (OR 4.00, 95% CI: 2.06-7.76), and became weaker in subjects older than 60 years of age (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 0.95-3.46). Compared with the uninfected subjects without a family history, subjects with both a family history and H. pylori infection had a 5-fold increased risk (OR 5.32, 95% CI: 2.76-10.25).\nAfter adjusting for environmental factors and H. pylori infection, a family history of gastric cancer remained independently associated with gastric cancer. The interaction between H. pylori infection and family history of gastric cancer might be a rationale for H. pylori eradication in the gastric cancer relatives as a strategy to prevent gastric cancer.","title":"Stomach cancer risk in gastric cancer relatives: interaction between Helicobacter pylori infection and family history of gastric cancer for the risk of stomach cancer.","pubmedId":"19561529"}
