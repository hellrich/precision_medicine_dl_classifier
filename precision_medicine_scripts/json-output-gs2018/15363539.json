The recent development of high-throughput technologies aimed at global molecular profiling of cancer is switching on the spotlight at previously unknown candidate genes involved in melanoma, such as WNT5A and BRAF. In fact, several tumor suppressors and oncogenes have been shown to be involved in melanoma pathogenesis, including CDKN2A, PTEN, TP53, RAS and MYC, though they have not been related to melanoma subtypes or validated as prognostic markers. Here, we have reviewed the published data relative to the major genes involved in melanoma pathogenesis, which may represent important markers for the identification of genetic profiles of melanoma subtypes.","title":"Genetic progression of metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"15363539"}
