Systematic and statistically significant comparative clinico-histopathologic studies have not yet been reported.\n113 necrotizing choroidal melanomas (NCM) recruited from 701 enucleated globes 1967-1988 were resectioned, stained and compared to 100 choroidal melanomas without necrosis (CM), and data of 74 patients with a follow-up of more than 10 years were evaluated.\nStatistically significant characteristics of NCM were: patient age \u003c 60 yrs. for NCM 27.4%, CM 46%; patient age in men for NCM was 64 yrs on average (CM: 58 yrs.), in women for NCM 67 yrs. (CM: 59 yrs.). Time elapsed between first symptoms and enucleation was \u003c 12 months in 15.9% of NCM (89% for CM), and \u003e 12 months in 23.9% of NCM (11% in CM). Mixed or epitheloid cell tumors was seen in 54.9% of NCM and 49% of CM, spindle cell tumors in 36.3% of NCM and 51% in CM. Advanced tumor stages T3 and T4 were present in 45.1% resp. 36.3% of NCM compared to 37% resp. 16% in CM. Scleral invasion was documented in 67.3% of NCM and 37% of CM, extrascleral dissemination in 43% of NCM and 16% of CM. Secondary glaucomas were seen in 62.2% of NCM and 6% CM, a penetration through Bruch\u0027s membrane in 61.0% of NCM and 46% of CM. Intratumoral hemorrhage was noted in 68.14% of NCM and 24% of CM, extratumoral bleeding in 23.9% of NCM and 0% CM. Inflammatory reactions in tumors were observed in 96.7% of NCM harboring \u003e 30% necrosis compared to 5% in CM, and extratumoral in 94.5% of NCM and 0% of CM. Intraocular extratumoral necrosis was seen in 23.9% of NCM and 0% of CM. There were no significant differences in the degree of pigmentation of the 90.3% pigmented NCM or of the 94% pigmented CM, neither in the tumor localization, being constantly behind the equator in 87% of cases. Survival of patients with NCM patients was 5 years and 9 months on average (5-year mortality rate 41.9%), and 74.3% were deceased from metastatic spread.\nSignificant clinical and histopathological differences between necrotizing and non-necrotizing malignant melanomas of the choroid can be identified. The inflammatory reaction of NCM must be further elucidated, particularly with respect to the nature of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.","title":"[Clinical and histopathological aspects of 113 necrotizing malignant melanomas of the choroid. 1.
