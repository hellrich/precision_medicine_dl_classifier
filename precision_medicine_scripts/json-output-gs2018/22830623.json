It was moderate/marked in 6 of 14 (43%) in situ or invasive melanomas. Upward migration of melanocytes in the epidermis was noted in 7 (33%) non-dysplastic and 10 (34%) dysplastic nevi but was generally limited to the lower half of the epidermis. Moderate/severe cytologic atypia was found in 14 (48%) dysplastic nevi and all melanomas but not in non-dysplastic nevi.\nProminent spongiotic reaction with eosinophils in the inflammatory infiltrate can affect all types of melanocytic lesions. Upward migration involving the uppermost layers of the epidermis, especially when extensive and present in areas with a less pronounced spongiotic reaction, and moderate/severe cytologic atypia indicate a melanoma.","title":"Melanocytic lesions with eczematous reaction (Meyerson\u0027s phenomenon) - a histopathologic analysis of 64 cases.","pubmedId":"22830623"}
