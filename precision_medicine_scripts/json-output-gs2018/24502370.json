The management of patients with advanced melanoma poses a significant challenge considering that the disease is refractory to most conventional therapies.\nThis review highlights some of the genes and signaling molecules that are mutated in melanoma patients. The authors also discuss protein kinase inhibitors targeting non-BRAF mutations that are now being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials.\nIn light of several preclinical and clinical studies, it is clear that targeting single-gene mutations may not provide a desired therapeutic gain in the context of melanoma. Consequently, research will need to focus on rational combinations of novel therapeutic agents targeting multiple genetic aberrations or deregulated pathways to achieve a desired maximum clinical benefit. There is certainly a need for a better understanding of the complex and redundant molecular signatures associated with melanoma development; this would open up new avenues for creating the next generation of targeted and effective therapeutics.","title":"Non-BRAF targeted therapies for melanoma: protein kinase inhibitors in Phase II clinical trials.","pubmedId":"24502370"}
