Direct DNA sequencing did not detect germline mutations in any APC exon. However, using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method, we detected germline deletions of all APC exons. Using dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified germline deletion of locus 5q22.1-22.2 that includes APC. Analysis of colorectal tumors identified somatic APC mutations in the cluster region in all polyps, but no loss of heterozygosity was detected in any polyp.
