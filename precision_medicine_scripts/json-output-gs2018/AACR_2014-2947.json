Past studies have shown the percentage of melanoma expressing the ligand for PD1, PD-L1 varies from 38 to 53% depending on the cutoff used to determine positivity and the antibodies used. In the majority of melanoma, expression of PD-L1 was associated with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and was believed to be induced by IFN gamma from T cells. Relatively few melanomas had (constitutive) PD-L1 expression in the absence of TILs.Study and Results: In the present study we examined the signal pathways involved in inducible and constitutive expression of PD-L1 expression on cultured melanoma cells, including those derived from patients pre and post vemurafenib treatment. Our results suggest that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) has a role in IFN-gamma inducible expression as shown by inhibition of PD-L1 expression with the inhibitor, BMS 345541 which blocks phosphorylation of the inhibitory IkB kinase, resulting in cytoplasmic retention of NF-kB p65 and p50 subunits. Luciferase based promoter reporter assays confirmed an association between NF-kB activity and PD-L1 expression levels. Targeting NF-kB was more effective in reducing inducible PD-L1 levels than targeting either the MAPK pathway or the P13Kinase/AKT pathway. Transfections with the super repressor, Inhibitor of kappa B alpha, mutated at S32 and S36, to correlate with PD-L1 levels are being carried out. In addition, si RNA mediated knockdown of the p50 and p65 subunits to confirm the involvement of NF-kB in PD-L1 expression will be studied. We are also currently dissecting the signaling pathways involved in constitutive expression of PD-L1.NF-kB is an important protein complex involved in adaptive and innate immune response and regulates cytokine and chemokine production in melanoma. It also contributes to induction of proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival, playing a role in resistance to targeted therapy. The present results highlight another important function of this crucial transcription factor which our recent studies show may be targetable by inhibitors of the bromo domain and terminal repeat (BET) reader proteins.","title":"Regulation of PD-L1 expression in human melanoma by NF-kB","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2947"}
