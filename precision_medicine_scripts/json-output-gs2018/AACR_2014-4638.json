Stabilization of p53 by antagonizing its negative regulator mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2) leads to selective induction of the p53 pathway, thus offering a promising therapeutic opportunity.NVP-CGM097 binds in the p53 pocket on the surface of Mdm2 and effectively disrupts the interaction between p53 and Mdm2. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and efficacy profile of this novel p53-Mdm2 inhibitor in mouse models of human cancer. During the medicinal chemistry discovery efforts, the compound series was optimized for oral administration. The selected compound, NVP-CGM097, was well absorbed in mice where the maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was observed about 3 hours post dose followed by a prolonged absorption phase. PD effects were determined by measuring the expression levels of p53 target genes including p21, PUMA and Mdm2 in tumors. The expression levels of p53 target genes correlated with the concentrations of NVP-CGM097 demonstrating a good PK/PD relationship.Optimal treatment schedules were investigated in the Mdm2-amplified, p53 wild-type osteosarcoma xenograft model SJSA-1. Interestingly, various schedules were highly efficacious at well-tolerated dose levels. Tumor regression was observed when NVP-CGM097 was administered in schedules ranging from daily to twice per week with no adverse effects. Following dose optimization studies, potent anti-tumor efficacy was observed in a range of p53 wild-type expressing xenograft models including Mdm2 non-amplified orthotopic AML as well as well-differentiated (WDLPS) and dedifferentiated (DDLPS) liposarcomas.Overall, we demonstrate that the novel p53-Mdm2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097 has a good PK profile and affects PD markers in human tumors leading to tumor regression at well-tolerated dose levels. These data strongly support clinical development of NVP-CGM097.","title":"NVP-CGM097: a novel p53-Mdm2 inhibitor exhibiting potent antitumor activity in mouse models of human cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4638"}
