The genomic DNA was extracted from mononuclear cells (MNC) of bone marrow or peripheral blood in 205 adult AML patients, the exon 4 of IDH1 gene was amplified by PCR, then the sequencing and comparison were performed. The results showed that IDH1 mutation was detected in 9 (4.39%) of 205 AML patients. There were 6 cases of R132H mutation, 1 of R132L mutation, 1 of R132G mutation and 1 of R132S mutation. Significantly more IDH1 aberrations were detected in AML-M2 (P \u003d 0.002) than other types. And the 9 patients with IDH1 mutation were characterized by low platelet count which was lower than patients with wild type IDH1 (P \u003d 0.003). IDH1 mutation combined with FLT3/ITD mutation was found in 5 cases, c-kit mutation in 1, NPM1 mutation in 2, and IDH1 mutation with CEBPA or WT1 mutation was not found, which revealed a significant interaction between IDH1 mutation and the FLT3/ITD positive genotype or the CEBPA wild-type. IDH1 mutation were detected in 4 of 71 (5.63%) CN-AML. There was no significant difference of IDH1 mutation incidence between the normal and abnormal karyotypes. It is concluded that the rate of IDH1 mutation was 4.39% in Chinese AML patients. IDH1 mutation is significantly associated with AML-M2, lower platelet counts in peripheral blood, FLT3/ITD mutation and CEBPA wild-type, but not with age, white blood cell count in peripheral blood, karyotype, NPM1, c-kit or WT1 mutation.","title":"[Detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene mutation in 205 AML patients and its clinical significance].","pubmedId":"23257422"}
