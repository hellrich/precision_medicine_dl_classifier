There is relatively little evidence to guide the clinician and patient. Here, we review the safety profile of the commonly used biological therapies for psoriasis in individuals of reproductive potential. Safety data were derived from large-scale registries, adverse event reporting databases, clinical trials and case reports. We assessed the effect of each therapy on adverse pregnancy outcomes including congenital malformations, and lactation with maternal administration, and male fertility and potential mutagenicity with paternal administration. We provide applicable guidance to inform clinician and patient before and after conception.
