Some optimism was recently provided in metastatic melanoma by the improved clinical outcomes observed in patients receiving PD-L1 blocking antibodies. A better understanding of the environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors limiting the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy will provide appropriate partner(s) for combination with Ipilimumab or PD1/PDL1 antibodies. Among the epigenetic factors, we have found that one member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, plays a critical role not only in the regulation of survival/apoptosis of melanoma cells but also in limiting their immunogenicity and recognition by immune effector cells. Particularly, we found a major role of HDAC6 as a modulator of the immunosuppresive STAT3/IL-10 pathway and down-regulation of tolerogenic PD-L1 molecules in melanoma cells. By analyzing HDAC6 knock-down melanoma cell lines (HDAC6KD) we demonstrated the inactivation of the STAT3 pathway and the subsequent down-regulation of its target genes, including the expression of PD-L1. We also observed that the PD-L1 expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 was decreased in melanoma isolated from xenograph tumor growth models after in vivo treatment with specific HDAC6 inhibitorsFortunately, there are multiple HDAC6-selective inhibitors available to mechanistically study the role of HDAC6 on these processes and provide a viable therapeutic avenue, which may minimize undesirable side effects that are characteristic of pan-HDACi such as SAHA. By building on our understanding of HDAC6 and applying these findings to novel experimental design, we hope to identify innovative therapeutic options to benefit cancer patients.","title":"Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) as a regulator of PD-L1 expression through STAT3 modulation in melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4089"}
