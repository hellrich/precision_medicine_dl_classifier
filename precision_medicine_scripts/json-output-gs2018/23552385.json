GC-GBMs and epithelioid GBMs (E-GBMs) can be histologically challenging to distinguish from PXA-A. We undertook this study specifically to address whether these 2 tumor types also showed the mutation. We tested our originally reported cohort of 8 E-GBMs and 2 rhabdoid GBMs (R-GBM) as well as 5 new E-GBMs (1 pediatric, 4 adult) and 9 GC-GBMs (2 pediatric, 7 adult) (n\u003d24) for BRAF V600E mutational status. Twenty-one of 24 had sufficient material for IDH-1 immunostaining, which is usually absent in PXAs, PXA-As, and primary GBMs but present in secondary GBMs. Patients ranged in age from 4 to 67 years. BRAF V600E mutation was identified in 7/13 of E-GBMs, including 3 of our original cases; patients with mutation were aged 10 to 50 years. None of the 9 GC-GBMs or 2 R-GBMs manifested this mutation, including pediatric patients. The sole secondary E-GBM was the single case manifesting positive IDH-1 immunoreactivity. A high percentage of E-GBMs manifest BRAF V600E mutation, paralleling PXAs. All R-GBMs and GC-GBMs were negative, although larger multi-institutional cohorts will have to be tested to extend this result. BRAF V600E mutational analyses should be performed on E-GBMs, particularly in all pediatric and young-aged adults, given the potential for BRAF inhibitor therapy in this subset of GBM patients.","title":"Epithelioid GBMs show a high percentage of BRAF V600E mutation.","pubmedId":"23552385"}
