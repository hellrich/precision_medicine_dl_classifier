We conducted a phase II trial in newly diagnosed glioblastoma utilizing a novel hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) schedule combined with temozolomide and bevacizumab.\nPatients with tumor volume ≤60 cc were treated with HFSRT (6 × 6 Gy to contrast enhancement and 6 × 4 Gy to FLAIR hyperintensity with dose painting) combined with concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide and bevacizumab at standard doses. Primary endpoint was 1-year overall survival (OS): promising \u003d 70%; nonpromising \u003d 50%; α \u003d 0.1; β \u003d 0.1.\nForty patients were enrolled (median age: 55 years; methylated MGMT promoter: 23%; unmethylated: 70%). The 1-year OS was 93% [95% confidence interval (CI), 84-100] and median OS was 19 months. The median PFS was 10 months, with no pseudo-progression observed. The objective response rate (ORR) was 57%. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas glioblastoma transcriptional subclasses (Nanostring assay) suggested patients with a proneural phenotype (26%) fared worse (ORR \u003d 14%, vs. 77% for other subclasses; P \u003d 0.009). Dynamic susceptibility-contrast perfusion MRI showed marked decreases in relative cerebral blood volume over time (P \u003c 0.0001) but had no prognostic value, whereas higher baseline apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratios and persistent hypermetabolism at the 6-month FDG-PET predicted poor OS (P \u003d 0.05 and 0.0001, respectively). Quality-of-life (FACT-BR-4) and neuropsychological test scores were stable over time, although some domains displayed transient decreases following HFSRT.\nThis aggressive radiotherapy schedule was safe and more convenient for patients, achieving an OS that is comparable with historical controls. Analysis of advanced neuroimaging parameters suggests ADC and FDG-PET as potentially useful biomarkers, whereas tissue correlatives uncovered the poor prognosis associated with the proneural signature in non-IDH-1-mutated glioblastoma.","title":"Phase II study of bevacizumab, temozolomide, and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.","pubmedId":"25107913"}
