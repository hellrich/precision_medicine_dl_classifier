The potential cause of a gender-based disparity in melanoma has been suspected for many years. A recent analysis suggests that female patients have a 30% survival advantage in cutaneous melanoma. Telomerase has been shown to add protective telomere repeats to chromosome endings and cause cancer cells to become immortal. We have recently discovered that the AR is expressed in melanoma cell lines. In current report, we tested the telomerase activity in lysates of both melanoma and prostate cancer cell lines. Telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) was carried out to test the activity of telomerase in melanoma A375, androgen-sensitive prostatic cancer LNCap and androgen-insensitive prostatic cancer PC-3 cell lines under treatments of steroid hormones, SARM and SERM compounds. The effects of sex hormones, selective androgen-receptor modulators (SARMs), and estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs) on telomerase activity in both melanoma and prostate cells were investigated.","title":"Effects of selective androgen-receptor and estrogen-receptor modulators on telomerase activity in melanoma and prostate cancer cells.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-1320"}
