Here we have analyzed the mechanisms that determine the therapeutic effect. Tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficient mice received once per week an i.v. injection of HLA-matched peripheral blood leukocytes and twice per week i.v. or intratumoral injections of FUPS: Leukocyte recovery and their activation state were monitored. The number of draining lymph node cells (LNCs) and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes increased continuously, and the yield of draining LNCs was improved significantly when the FuPs were applied locally. In IL-2-FuP-treated mice, the majority of draining LNCs and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes expressed T-cell activation markers and IL-2, thus being classified as T helper type 1 cells. These cells displayed strong proliferative activity and initiated activation of lymphokine-activated killer cells and CTLS: TNF-FuP supported activation of CTLs and of monocytes as revealed by TNF expression and cytostatic activity. Neither the antibody, nor IL-2, nor TNF, nor the mixture of antibody and cytokines exhibited the full-fledged activational potency of the FUPS: Notably, activation of immune effector mechanisms was much stronger when the FuPs were applied intratumorally. This is the first report to show that FuPs are efficient immunostimulants in vivo for native leukocytes. Although IL-2-FuP induced a T helper type 1 response with recruitment of LAK and CTL, TNF-FuP efficiently recruited and activated monocytes and, in a less pronounced manner, CTLS:","title":"Interleukin 2-antibody and tumor necrosis factor-antibody fusion proteins induce different antitumor immune responses in vivo.","pubmedId":"11350910"}
