The age of disease manifestation was significantly lower in mutated (MT) BRAF patients, and the median age difference between the wild-type (WT) and MT BRAF groups (P\u003d 0.002) was 10 years. A tumour thickness more than 1 mm was also more frequently observed in the MT BRAF group (P\u003d 0.059). Patients from the MT BRAF group were more likely to have ulceration compared to the WT group (P\u003d 0.088). No statistically significant differences were found between the relapse-free, progression-free or overall survival of CM patients in the MT BRAF and WT BRAF groups.\nThe data obtained show that the V600E BRAF mutation occurred in about half of melanoma patients; it was associated with earlier manifestation of melanoma and likely with more aggressive clinical features.","title":"The \\textit{BRAF} V600E mutation in single- institution study of Russian melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"26600396"}
