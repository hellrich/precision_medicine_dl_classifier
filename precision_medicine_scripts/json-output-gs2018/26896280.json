To investigate this possibility, we evaluated a specific role for FGFR1 in glioblastoma radioresistance as modeled by U87 and LN18 glioblastomas in mouse xenograft models. Silencing FGFR1 decreased radioresistance in a manner associated with radiation-induced centrosome overduplication and mitotic cell death. Inhibiting PLCγ (PLCG1), a downstream effector signaling molecule for FGFR1, was sufficient to produce similar effects, arguing that PLCγ is an essential mediator of FGFR1-induced radioresistance. FGFR1 silencing also reduced expression of HIF1α, which in addition to its roles in hypoxic responses exerts an independent effect on radioresistance. Finally, FGFR1 silencing delayed the growth of irradiated tumor xenografts, in a manner that was associated with reduced HIF1α levels but not blood vessel alterations. Taken together, our results offer a preclinical proof of concept that FGFR1 targeting can degrade radioresistance in glioblastoma, a widespread problem in this tumor, prompting clinical investigations of the use of FGFR1 inhibitors for radiosensitization.
