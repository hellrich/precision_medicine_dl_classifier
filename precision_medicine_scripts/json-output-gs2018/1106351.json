Possible reasons for this observation are discussed. The much higher incidence of nearly all malignant neoplasms in high age in the USA raises suspicion that cancer registration in the GDR for these age groups is incomplete. Wide differences in younger and middle age cannot be solely explained by underregistration in one country. Incidence of stomach cancer is much higher in the GDR than in the USA and incidence of malignant neoplasms of colon, breast (female), prostate, and urinary bladder is significantly higher in North America. Remarkable but not as big differences are observed for most cancer sites. Only part of these observations can be explained by different diagnostic criteria (e. g. acute leukosis). It is concluded that there is a real difference in cancer risk between the GDR and the USA. It is hoped that these results stimulate special studies in order to elucidate the causes of different cancer incidence and there by to gain more insight in factors which enhance the risk of cancer.","title":"[Comparative considerations on incidence of malignant neoplasms in the United States (White) 1969-1971 and in the German Democratic Republic 1971 (author\u0027s transl)].","pubmedId":"1106351"}
