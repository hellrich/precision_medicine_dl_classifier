Here we present evidence to show the role of miR-198 in lung cancer development. Our results showed that ectopic expression of miR-198 inhibits the viability and induces the apoptosis of human non-small cell lung cancer cells A549 and NCI-H460, while miR-198 inhibition resulted in opposite changes. In nude mice miR-198 inhibits A549 growth of tumor graft. We further demonstrated that miR-198 directly targets fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in lung cancer cells. Restoring FGFR1 expression blocked the inhibitory function of miR-198, while FGFR1 inhibition achieved the similar phenotypes of miR-198 overexpression. Hence, our data delineates the molecular pathway by which miR-198 inhibits lung cancer cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis, and may have important implication for the treatment of lung carcinogenesis.","title":"MicroRNA-198 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of lung cancer cells via targeting FGFR1.","pubmedId":"24357456"}
