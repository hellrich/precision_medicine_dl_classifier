The APC compound presented here, S-1-O-phosphocholine-2- N-acetyl-octadecane (S-NC-2) induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. To define the molecular requirements for S-NC-2-induced apoptosis, activation of caspase-8 and -3 and the cleavage of death substrates, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), were investigated in Jurkat, BJAB, SKW6.4 and K562 cells. The signalling pathway seems to be initiated at the death receptor level. Cells that are defective in Fas-receptor signalling (e.g., FADDdn BJAB), as well as cells lacking the Fas receptor (K562), were resistant to S-NC-2 treatment. Furthermore, the treatment of Jurkat cells with S-NC-2 resulted in the clustering of death receptor molecules and co-localisation of the Fas receptor with caveolin, a marker for lipid rafts. In addition, the involvement of mitochondria was detected, since S-NC-2 induces the breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 prevented the loss of delta psi(m) in type II (Jurkat) but not in type I cells (SKW6.4). Moreover, cleavage of Bid was found, which points to a possible linkage between the receptor-dependent and the mitochondrial pathways.","title":"On the mechanism of alkylphosphocholine (APC)-induced apoptosis in tumour cells.","pubmedId":"15843169"}
