Adding irinotecan (iri) to cet in refractory pts who had progressed on iri increased response and delayed progression in the BOND trial, which was conducted prior to recognition that RAS mutations are predictive of EGFR-inhibitor (EGFR-I) resistance. Subsequent trials in chemorefractory pts used single agent EGFR-I as standard. In the era of biomarker selection, the benefit of continuing iri versus single agent EGFR-I had not been resolved. Methods: ICECREAM is a randomised phase II trial evaluating cet v cet + iri in chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, stratified for KRAS G13D mutation (previously reported) or no mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PI3KCA (Quad WT). EGFR-I nave, ECOG PS 0-1 pts, progressing within 6 months of iri and refractory (or intolerant) to fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin were randomised to cet 400mg/m2 IV loading then 250mg/m2 weekly +/- iri 180mg/m2q2 wks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months (6m PFS); secondary endpoints were response rate (RR), overall survival (OS), toxicity and quality of life (QOL). Results: From Nov 2012 to June 2016, 48 Quad WT pts were recruited: 2 ineligible (not iri-refractory, BRAF mutation) wre not included for analyses and a further 2 not evaluable for response. Characteristics were balanced between cet (n \u003d 21) v cet-iri (n \u003d 25), except for sex (male 62 v 72%) and primary site (left 95 v 68%). 6m PFS rate was 14% v 41%; HR 0.39 (95% CI: 0.200.78, p \u003d 0.008). RR was 10% (2 PR) v 36% (1 CR, 8 PR); p \u003d 0.04. Toxicities were higher with cet-iri; at least one grade 3/4 adverse event in 50 v 23%. No differences in global or specific QOL were seen. Conclusions: The AGITG ICECREAM trial confirms a significant synergy for the addition of iri to cet and improved PFS in Quad WT chemorefractory mCRC, echoing data in molecularly unselected pts.
