Areas covered: We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on the role of nivolumab in melanoma Expert commentary: Nivolumab is approved by FDA and EMA for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. Nivolumab is superior to chemotherapy and to ipilimumab in previously untreated patients and to chemotherapy in ipilimumab pre-treated patients. The addition ipilimumab to nivolumab is associated with a higher response rate and a better PFS, particularly in patients with PD-L1 negative tumors, albeit at the cost of an increase in grade 3-4 adverse event rate. Definitive survival data on this combination are pending and the selection of patients most likely to benefit from this combination and its pharmacoeconomics are to be elucidated. Prospectively validated predictive markers are lacking. Of particular interest are immune-related adverse events which should be managed according to published guidelines.","title":"Nivolumab in melanoma.","pubmedId":"27776441"}
