In the present study, we analyzed by immunohistochemistry, a panel of benign nevi, superficial spreading and nodular primary melanomas and metastases for expression of activated p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (p-JNK) and correlated the findings with known prognostic variables. Twenty-five and 35% of the primaries and 9 and 25% of the metastases expressed variable levels of p-p38 and p-JNK, respectively. In benign nevi, 73.5% expressed p-JNK and 7% expressed p-p38. For patients with superficial spreading melanomas, high level of cytoplasmic p-JNK was associated with thicker tumors (P\u003d0.017) and shorter disease-free survival (P\u003d0.003) as well as with markers of cell proliferation (cyclin A (P\u003d0.017) and p21 (P\u003d0.021)). In nodular melanomas, nuclear p-p38 was associated with Ki-67 (P\u003d0.012), but neither cytoplasmic nor nuclear localized p-p38 was associated with disease outcome. Of note, in superficial spreading melanomas, a positive correlation between cytoplasmic p-JNK and cytoplasmic p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK(1/2) (P\u003d0.005) and p-p38 (P\u003d0.003) was observed. Likewise, p-p38 in cytoplasm was positively associated with cytoplasmic p-ERK1/2 (P\u003c0.0005) and p-Akt (P\u003d0.047). In contrast, except for a positive correlation between nuclear p-p38 and membranous p-TrkA (P\u003d0.02), no correlation between the activation status of the different signaling pathways was observed in nodular melanomas. In conclusion, our results suggest that in benign nevi activated JNK may have a role in restricting uncontrolled cell proliferation or survival. However, during tumor progression, activation of JNK is associated with cell proliferation and shorter relapse-free period for patients with superficial spreading melanomas, suggesting that the JNK activation status could be a marker for clinical outcome in at least a subgroup of malignant melanoma. In contrast, activation of p38 seems to play a less important role in development and progression of malignant melanomas.","title":"Activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase is associated with cell proliferation and shorter relapse-free period in superficial spreading malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"16951673"}
