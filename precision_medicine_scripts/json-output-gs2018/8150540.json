It was reported that these patients have raised serum IgA levels. We investigated whether IgA-anti-Fab autoantibodies, which occur in association with immune dysfunction, are present in patients with head-and-neck cancer. Sera of 101 patients with squamous-cell carcinoma (SCCHN) and 8 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACCHN) of the head and neck were tested in ELISA for IgA-anti-Fab autoantibody activity. IgA-anti-Fab serum activity was significantly higher in both SCCHN and ACCHN patients than in healthy controls. In patients with SCCHN, an association between disease stage and IgA-anti-Fab activity was established. Stage-IV patients had significantly higher IgA-anti-Fab than stage-I patients or healthy controls. Stage-II and stage-III patients had intermediate levels. Extremely high IgA-anti-Fab activity was observed in 7 patients who died within 6 months following testing, suggesting a relationship of autoimmunity with terminal disintegration of physiological body functions. IgA-anti-Fab autoantibodies may explain the occurrence of immune defects in patients with head-and-neck cancer.","title":"Association of IgA-anti-Fab autoantibodies with disease stage in head-and-neck cancer.","pubmedId":"8150540"}
