Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a molecular target for antibody-based therapy in various cancer types, and it may play important roles in the development of esophageal cancer.\nThis review evaluates the expression, function, and mechanism of EGFR in esophageal cancer and analyzes its value for the prognosis and therapy of esophageal cancer. Future developments toward the clinical applications of EGFR to cancer treatment are also envisaged.\nEGFR may function as an ideal therapeutic target for esophageal cancer. Further investigation of epidermal growth-factor-receptor-mediated pathways will push insight into the novel strategies of target therapy for esophageal cancer. More clinical trials should be performed to promote the success of therapeutic-clinical use of EGFR and its targets in esophageal cancer.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor: an important target in esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"23855932"}
