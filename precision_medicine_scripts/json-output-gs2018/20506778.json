There is growing evidence that the sex is an important prognostic factor for the patients with lung cancer.\nWe present 440 radically operated patients with non-small cell lung cancer between 1997 and 2004, age range: 23-82 years (378 male- 85.91% and 62 female14.09%).\nThe 5-years survival rate was 26,19% for the men (99 patients) and 51.61% for the female patients (32 patients).\nSex is a significant prognostic factor for the patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Female sex is a good prognostic factor for survival.","title":"[Sex as a prognostic factor for the patients with non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"20506778"}
