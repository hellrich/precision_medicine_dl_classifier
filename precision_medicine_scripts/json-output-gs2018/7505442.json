Previous structural studies of rat and human CD2 indicate that this adhesion domain is immunoglobulin-like. Here we report that the CD58 binding site is a well-circumscribed, charged surface area covering approximately 770 A2 on the AGFCC\u0027C\" face of the CD2 beta barrel. This site contains beta-strand residues in the carboxyl-terminal half of the F strand (including Lys-82 and Tyr-86), the top of the C strand (Asp-32 and Lys-34), and the C\u0027 strand (Gln-46), which are all solvent exposed. In addition, several exposed residues on the FG loop (Gly-90, Lys-91, Asn-92, and Val-93), the CC\u0027 loop (Lys-41 and Lys-43), and the C\u0027C\" loop (Arg-48 and Lys-51) form this site. In contrast, neither residues on the more peripheral G and C\" strands of the same CD2 surface nor residues on B, E, and D strands of the opposite face are involved in CD58 binding. This CD58 binding site is predicted to lie most distal to the T-lymphocyte surface membrane, with ready access to CD58 on the surface of the opposing antigen-presenting cell.","title":"The CD58 (LFA-3) binding site is a localized and highly charged surface area on the AGFCC\u0027C\" face of the human CD2 adhesion domain.","pubmedId":"7505442"}
