Here we report the antitumor activities of icotinib, a selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), as second-line treatment for advanced esophageal cancer with EGFR over-expression or amplification. Methods:    In this phase II, single-arm study, eligible patients were adults with advanced esophageal cancer confirmed by histology, who had received at least first-line chemotherapy, with EGFR over-expression [immunohistochemistry (IHC), 3+] or amplification [positive fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH)]. Participants were treated with oral icotinib (250 mg, three times daily).The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR).  Results:    Between December, 2013 and January, 2015, 38 patients were enrolled (37 with squamous cell carcinoma, 1 with adenocarcinoma) with a median age of 60, in which 36 were IHC 3+ (94.7%) and 2 were IHC 2+ with positive FISH. And as of the December 31, 2014 cutoff, 33 patients were evaluable for response. The ORR was 15.2% (5/33), consisting of 1 CR and 4 PRs, and the disease control rate was 54.5% (18/33). The median duration of treatment in 18 patients (CR + PR + SD) is 12.3 weeks with the longest being 28+ weeks. Twenty-three out of 33 patients (69.7%) experienced at least one adverse event (AE) with rash (42.4%), diarrhea (24.2%), pain (21.2%), fatigue (15.2%) and vomiting (12.1%) as the most common ones. Most AEs were mild and reversible and no grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported.  Conclusions:    Second-line icotinib treatment in advanced esophageal cancer with EGFR over-expression or amplification demonstrated favorable outcome along with a high safety profile. However, the role of EGFR over-expression or amplification as predictive biomarker still needs further exploration. Clinical trial information: NCT01855854.
