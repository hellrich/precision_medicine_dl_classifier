In 10 of 10 patients for whom samples were available, the mutation was not detected before the initiation of imatinib therapy. Three mutations (T315I, Y253H, and F317L present in 3, 1, and 1 patients, respectively) have a predicted role in abrogating imatinib binding to BCR/ABL, whereas 3 other mutations (E255K, G250E, and M351T, present in 4, 2, and 2 patients, respectively) do not. Thus we confirm a high frequency of mutations clustered within the ATP-binding region of BCR/ABL in resistant patients. Screening may allow intervention before relapse by identifying emerging mutations with defined impacts on imatinib binding. Certain mutations may respond to higher doses of imatinib, whereas other mutations may mandate switching to another therapeutic strategy.","title":"High frequency of point mutations clustered within the adenosine triphosphate-binding region of BCR/ABL in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who develop imatinib (STI571) resistance.","pubmedId":"11964322"}
