However,             the correlation between the KIF5B/RET fusion gene status and the clinicopathological             features of surgically-treated lung cancer has not been well characterized. In             this study, we have independently investigated the KIF5B/RET fusion gene status             in 371 surgically-treated NSCLCs (270 were adenocarcinomas and 101 were squamous             cell carcinomas), 60 breast cancers, 11 metastatic lung cancers from colon cancers             and thyroid papillary adenocarcinoma cases at the Nagoya City University Hospital.             The fusion gene status was analyzed by an RT-PCR-based assay and by using direct             sequencing. We detected 3 of 270 cases of KIF5B/RET fusion genes in adenocarcinomas             (1.1%) consisting of female and never smokers with mixed subtype adenocarcinomas.             The fusion genes were detected exclusively with other mutations, such as EGFR,             Kras, Braf, erbB2 mutations, and EML4/ALK fusion. KIF5B/RET fusion was not detected             in the cases with squamous cell carcinoma or other types of cancers. From the             3 cases, 2 were KIF5B (exon 15); RET (exon 12) fusions with papillary dominant             and 1 case was KIF5B (exon 22); RET (exon 12) fusion with solid dominant adenocarcinoma.             The matched normal lung tissues did not display translocation. We reported KIF5B/RET             fusion genes as a driver somatic mutation of lung adenocarcinomas. The cinicopathological             backgrounds of the KIF5B/RET fusion-positive patients were similar with those             of the EML4/ALK fusion-positive patients. The chimeric oncogene may be a promising             molecular target for the personalized diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC.","title":"KIF5B/RET fusion gene in surgically-treated adenocarcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"22797671"}
