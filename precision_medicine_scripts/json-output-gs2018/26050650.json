We performed a comprehensive analysis of the impact of IKZF1(del) in a large cohort of children (n\u003d1223) with BCR-ABL1-negative BCP-ALL treated in the EORTC-CLG trial 58951. Patients with IKZF1(del) had a lower 8-year event-free survival (EFS, 67.7% versus 86.5%; hazard ratio (HR)\u003d2.41; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u003d1.75-3.32; P\u003c0.001). Importantly, despite association with high-risk features such as high minimal residual disease, IKZF1(del) remained significantly predictive in multivariate analyses. Analysis by genetic subtype showed that IKZF1(del) increased risk only in the high hyperdiploid ALLs (HR\u003d2.57; 95% CI\u003d1.19-5.55; P\u003d0.013) and in \u0027B-other\u0027 ALLs, that is, lacking classifying genetic lesions (HR\u003d2.22; 95% CI\u003d1.45-3.39; P\u003c0.001), the latter having then a dramatically low 8-year EFS (56.4; 95% CI\u003d44.6-66.7). Among IKZF1(del)-positive patients randomized for vincristine-steroid pulses during maintenance, those receiving pulses had a significantly higher 8-year EFS (93.3; 95% CI\u003d61.3-99.0 versus 42.1; 95% CI\u003d20.4-62.5). Thus, IKZF1(del) retains independent prognostic significance in the context of current risk-adapted protocols, and is associated with a dismal outcome in \u0027B-other\u0027 ALL. Addition of vincristine-steroid pulses during maintenance may specifically benefit to IKZF1(del) patients in preventing relapses.
