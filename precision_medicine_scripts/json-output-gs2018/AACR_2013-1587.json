The ability of LZAP to regulate p53 in the absence of ARF has been largely unexplored. Here, we show that LZAP depletion diminished expression of mutant and wild-type p53 protein. LZAP activity toward p53 was independent of ARF and the known p53 regulators, Wip1 and HDM2. Loss of LZAP decreased p53 translation and destabilized p53 protein due, at least partially, to increased nucleolin expression. Knockdown of LZAP abrogated p53 stabilization induced by ionizing radiation, and LZAP depletion protected wild-type p53 cells from radiation or chemotherapeutic agents, while rendering cells expressing mutant or no p53 more sensitive. In human HNSCC, LZAP levels correlated with p53 levels, and remarkably, tumors with low LZ were less likely to have p53 mutations. These data suggest that loss of LZAP represents a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation in human cancer. Given these findings, inhibition of LZAP activity toward p53 for patients with tumors harboring p53 mutations may represent a therapeutic strategy to simultaneously sensitize tumors while protecting normal tissues from radiation or chemotherapy.","title":"Loss of LZAP inactivates p53 in head and neck cancer and regulates sensitivity of cells to DNA damage in the p53-dependent manner.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-1587"}
