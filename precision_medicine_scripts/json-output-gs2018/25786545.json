We report the largest series of nine cases diagnosed in a single institute over the last 13 years and review published literature. Mean age at presentation was 12.8 years (range: 22 months to 27years). Seven out of nine cases were supratentorial (frontal/frontoparietal - three, parieto-occipital - three, parafalcine - one), one was intraventricular and another was optochaismatic/suprasellar. Five cases were high grade (anaplastic) astroblastomas with Ki-67 labeling index of 8-10%. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evidence suggesting origin from cells intermediate between ependymocytes and astrocytes is presented. The histogenetic origin of these tumors remains speculative. But the lack of Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation as detected by immunohistochemistry in this study, which is similar to ependymomas supports putative origin from ependymoglial cells. Out of the nine cases, recurrence was noted in one case, 12 months after gross total resection with progression to high grade in the recurrent tumor. There is no recommended treatment protocol due to the rarity of this entity and prognostic factors are yet to be established.","title":"Lack of IDH1 mutation in astroblastomas suggests putative origin from ependymoglial cells?","pubmedId":"25786545"}
