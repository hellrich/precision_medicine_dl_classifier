Clinically, basal cell carcinomas include numerous nodular and flat types. The lesions of basal cell carcinoma are usually asymptomatic until enlargement, bleeding or invasion of underlying tissue occurs. Metastasis is rare. A biopsy should be obtained before destructive treatment is carried out. Surgical excision, curettage and electrodesiccation or cryosurgery are acceptable procedures for removal of most lesions. Periodic follow-up is necessary to screen for new or recurrent skin cancer.","title":"Basal cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"8237741"}
