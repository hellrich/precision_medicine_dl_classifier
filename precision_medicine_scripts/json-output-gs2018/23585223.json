The expiration date for follow-up was December 31, 2011. The predictive factors of postoperative survival for NSCLC patients with unexpected mediastinal lymph node metastasis were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression.\nA total of 263 patients were enrolled. The follow-up rate was 91.63%. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 94.6, 55.2, and 26.3%, respectively. Video-assisted thoracotomy surgery (VATS; odds ratio [OR] 0.659; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.469 to 0.927; p \u003d 0.017), multiple stations of metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes (OR 1.605; 95% CI 1.180 to 2.183; p \u003d 0.003), and no adjuvant chemotherapy (OR 1.576; 95% CI 1.105 to 2.246; p \u003d 0.012) were independent predictive factors for unexpected N2 patients. The median survival after VATS was superior to that after thoracotomy for patients with a single station of metastatic mediastinal lymph node (48.45 m vs 37.34 m, p \u003d 0.018). The median survival without any adjuvant chemotherapy was inferior to that after adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with multiple stations of metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes (20.32 m vs 31.55 m, p \u003d 0.001).\nThe postoperative survival for NSCLC patients with cN0-pN2 was related to operational method, adjuvant chemotherapy, and the number of metastatic mediastinal lymph node stations. Patients with a single station of metastatic mediastinal lymph node are likely to benefit from VATS, whereas patients with multiple stations of metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes are likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.","title":"Analysis of predictive factors for postoperative survival for non small cell lung carcinoma patients with unexpected mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis.","pubmedId":"23585223"}
