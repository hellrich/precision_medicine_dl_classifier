A mutation was subsequently characterized in the aborted fetus, as well as in the mother, sister and grand-mother as an 18bp deletion in exon 15 of the patched homologue 1 (PTCH1) gene. MC1R gene sequencing identified in two NBCCS patients affected by multiple basal cell carcinomas a functional MC1R variant, D294H, previously shown to be associated with skin cancer risk. This variant was absent in the NBCCS patient that did not develop basal cell carcinomas, suggesting that this variant could have favored the development of skin cancers, in patients carrying the PTCH1 mutation.","title":"Prenatal manifestation in a family affected by nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.","pubmedId":"18539553"}
