We therefore examined NSE levels in 240 patients of whom 169 had no clinical evidence of disease (NED) and 71 had metastatic disease. There was no statistically significant difference in NSE levels in patients with NED compared with metastatic disease as well as those with high tumor burden compared with low or intermediate tumor burden. In addition, the mean absolute values of NSE, despite a slight elevation with tumor burden, were within the normal range (\u003c 20 ng/ml). Our data suggest that NSE levels measured by the method used in our study are of no benefit in melanoma.","title":"Neuron-specific enolase as a tumor marker in metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"8092117"}
