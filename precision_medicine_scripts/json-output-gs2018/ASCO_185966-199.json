In ovarian cancer, PARP inhibitors have shown improved response rate and progression-free survival in clinical studies. We investigated the frequency of HR mutations/alterations in melanoma. Methods: Comprehensive genomic profiling, (next-generation sequencing [NGS]) that included the entire coding sequence of 315 cancer-related genes was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. The patient and tumor characteristics were obtained from electronic health records. Results: At our institution (CPMC), 59 patients underwent NGS analysis of melanoma specimens. Eighteen (30.5%) harbored a mutation in at least 1 of the HR genes in their tumor. The patient characteristics are: median age 69, male (83%), primary head and neck melanoma (61%), absence of ulceration at the primary site (86%) and mitotic rate \u003e1 mm/m2 (86%). Tumor mutation burden was high in 12 (67%) patients and low in 1 (6%) patient. The most commonly altered gene was ARID2 (11.9%), followed by ARID1A, FANCA, ATM, BRCA1 (3.4% each). Three patients had multiple HR alterations: one with mutations in ARID1A, BRCA1 and MRE11A, one with mutations in ARID2 and ATM, and one with mutations in ARID2 and CHEK2. Among the 18 patients with HR mutation(s), concurrent NF1, NRAS, BRAF (V600), and KIT mutations were found in 7 (39%), 6 (33%), 5 (28%) and 1 (6%) patients, respectively. A larger dataset analyzed by Foundation Medicine (FM) (n\u003d1,986) showed a similar pattern: The most common mutations/alterations were ARID2, followed by ARID1A, ATM, ATRX, BRCA2, ATR, BRCA1, BRIP1 and FANCA (Table). Conclusions: HR mutations / alterations are frequently observed in metastatic melanoma. Melanomas with these alterations may represent a unique subset of patients who could potentially benefit from PARP inhibitors.
