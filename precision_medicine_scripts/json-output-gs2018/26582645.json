D2HG has been shown to promote leukemogenesis even in the absence of mutated IDH, but the prognostic significance of pretreatment serum D2HG levels in patients with IDH-mutated AML is unclear. We measured D2HG serum levels in 84 patients with IDH-mutated AML treated in the prospective, randomized multicenter AML2003 trial of the German Study Alliance Leukemia. Multivariate Cox regression showed D2HG levels to negatively impact on event-free survival (EFS) as a continuous variable in the entire IDH(mut) cohort (P\u003d0.04), with no effect on overall survival (OS). In a subgroup analysis, the negative impact of D2HG on EFS was found to be restricted to patients with mutations in IDH1 (P\u003d0.003), adjusted for age, leukocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase and European LeukemiaNet risk score. We thus conclude that pretreatment D2HG serum levels may yield prognostic information in patients with IDH1-mutated, but not in IDH2-mutated AML, possibly due to different subcellular localizations of IDH1 and IDH2.
