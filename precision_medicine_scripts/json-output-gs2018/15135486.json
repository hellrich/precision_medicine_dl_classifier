Autopsy-based diagnoses were excluded. As control group the entire Swedish population was used and the risk of death in patients after diagnosis of aPC was compared with the normal risk taking age, sex and calendar year into account. The risk for a second tumour disease after diagnosis of aPC was also calculated.\nPatients with aPC had an increased tumour-related mortality after diagnosis of aPC. For both men and women this mortality was four times higher than for controls. Liver/biliary tract and CNS tumours in men; and malignant melanoma and uterine cervical cancer in women were significantly over-represented in the cohort of patients with aPC.\nPatients with aPC run an increased risk of developing additional cancers. Surveillance strategies may thus be necessary for these patients.","title":"Mortality associated with pheochromocytoma in a large Swedish cohort.","pubmedId":"15135486"}
