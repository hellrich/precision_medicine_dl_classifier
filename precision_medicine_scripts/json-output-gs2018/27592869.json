After several years of failure of treatment of metastatic melanoma, the development of BRAF- and later MEK inhibitors was considered revolutionary. Treatment with BRAF inhibitors alone and especially in combination with a MEK inhibitor improves outcome for patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma. However, even when treated with the combination of the inhibitors, many patients develop acquired resistance within a year.
