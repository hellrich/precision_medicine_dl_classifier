The most common hormonal treatments today use injections of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 5 LHRH agonist formulations for treatment of prostate cancer in the United States. Of these approved products, 3 involve different delivery systems for the LHRH superagonist leuprolide acetate. Sustained-release formulations of 2 distinct LHRH agonists, goserelin acetate and triptorelin pamoate, are also commercially available. This review focuses on new data on a novel formulation of leuprolide acetate (Eligard; Atrix Laboratories Inc., Fort Collins, CO) that incorporates a unique mixture of selected polymers and solvents to achieve sustained drug delivery after subcutaneous injection. The FDA has approved 1-month and 3-month formulations of Eligard, and 4-month and 6-month products are in development. In clinical trials, Eligard achieves reliable and sustained suppression of serum testosterone to castration levels (\u003c or \u003d50 ng/dL). Of the patients treated with the 1-month and 3-month formulations, 98% (115 of 117) and 94% (104 of 111), respectively, reached testosterone levels of \u003c or \u003d20 ng/dL. Breakthroughs, defined as testosterone levels \u003e50 ng/dL after achievement of castration levels, occurred rarely at 0% (0 of 117) for the 1-month and at 0.9% (1 of 111) for the 3-month formulations in patients receiving Eligard. The degree of disease control and the adverse-events profile are commensurate with the effectiveness of the testosterone suppression; the incidence of severe hot flashes is actually lower than anticipated. Additional studies with these novel formulations are warranted.","title":"Eligard: leuprolide acetate in a novel sustained-release delivery system.","pubmedId":"12667884"}
