In the present study we found that highly metastatic rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines also responded differentially to Tf in proliferation assays, and cell monolayers bound Tf in relation to their metastatic potential (MTPaB10 \u003e MTPaB5 \u003e MTLn3 \u003e MTLn2 \u003e MTC \u003e MTF7 \u003e MTPa). The brain-colonizing lines PaB10 and PaB5 were the most responsive to Tf and had the highest numbers of Tf receptors. Different human breast cancer cell lines also responded differentially to Tf in proliferation assays and bound different amounts of Tf to their cell surface Tf receptors. Transferrin binding, but not growth response, correlated with metastatic and invasive properties of lines selected from the human MCF-7 series (MCF7/LCC2 \u003e MCF7/LCC1 \u003e MCF7). In examining the transferrin binding and growth response of lines from the human MDA series, the Tf binding and growth response was MDA231 \u003e MDA435 \u003e MDA468. The lines MDA435 and MDA231 were metastatic in nude mouse assays, whereas the line MDA468 was not. Scatchard analysis indicated the presence of a single class of receptor for Tf on the rat and human mammary cell lines. The results suggest that neoplastic cells displaying various metastatic properties may express differing numbers of Tf receptors and respond differently to growth factors such as Tf.","title":"Differences in transferrin response and numbers of transferrin receptors in rat and human mammary carcinoma lines of different metastatic potentials.","pubmedId":"8314858"}
