Some studies suggest ATAD2 is highly expressed in cancer cells. In our previous studies, we found that ATAD2 is highly expressed in HCC tissues, compared with adjacent normal tissues, and patients with high expression of ATAD2 had a poorer prognosis. Moreover, we found mir-372 can regulate the expression of ATAD2 in HCC cell lines. We also detected a relationship between the mRNA expression of ATAD2 and Ptch1 by gene microarray. Here, we completed the function studies of ATAD2 in vivo and in vitro, and tested whether ATAD2 could regulate the Hh pathway. ATAD2 and Hh pathway protein expressions in 80 HCC specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The mRNA expression of ATAD2 and Hh pathway members in paired-HCC tissues and cell lines were, respectively, analyzed using quantitative PCR. ATAD2‑RNAi was transduced into HCCLM3 and Huh7 cells, using a lentiviral vector. The effect of ATAD2 in HCC cell lines on cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. Tumorigenicity experiments in nude mice were performed to test the function of ATAD2 in vivo. Pharmacological regulation of Hh signaling was performed to test the relation between the ATAD2 and Hh pathways and C-myc. We found that ATAD2 and Ptch1 were both highly expressed in HCC tissues, compared with paired normal hepatic tissues. In addition, we found that ATAD2 could affect the expression of the Hh pathway by PCR and western blot anaysis in HCC cell lines, by observing the outcome before and after transfection. We speculate that ATAD2 cooperates with the MYC gene to regulate the expression of SMO and Gli, activating the Hh pathway and inducing an active feedback of the Hh pathway.","title":"Epigenetic high regulation of ATAD2 regulates the Hh pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24805933"}
