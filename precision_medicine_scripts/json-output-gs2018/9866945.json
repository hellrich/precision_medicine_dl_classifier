In fact, in patients operated on for follicular carcinoma bone metastases, also many years after primary surgery, are reported. A case of skull metastases in a young women occurred 3 years after a near total lobectomy for follicular thyroid carcinoma is described. After six years the patient underwent total thyroidectomy, resection of skull metastases, radiometabolic therapy with I131 180 m Ci; now she is disease free at three years of follow-up. The biology of metastases in thyroid follicular carcinoma, risk factors and diagnostic and therapeutic controversies are analyzed. Good prognostic factors are considered age \u003c 45 years, good degree of differentiation of primary tumor, small size of bone metastases and early appearance after primary diagnosis. The conclusions is drawn that bone metastases are the worst prognostic factors. In case of single lesion, surgical treatment allows good results.","title":"[Cranial metastases from a follicular carcinoma of the thyroid.
