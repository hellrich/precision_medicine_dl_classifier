Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) cultured from metastatic lesions in five patients yielded cytolytic CD8+ T cells with specific activity against autologous and MHC class I-compatible allogeneic melanoma targets. In four of the five cases studied, CD4+ T cells purified from bulk TIL cultures also reacted specifically with autologous melanoma cells, as manifested by the secretion of various cytokines (GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma) after a 24 h cocultivation. Cytokine secretion by CD4+ T cells was MHC class II restricted, and proved to be a more reliable indicator of the immunologic reactivity of CD4+ T cells than cytolysis. Three of the four reactive CD4+ TIL failed to recognize allogeneic melanomas, suggesting recognition of Ag with limited expression in the patient population. Cloning such Ags may provide clues to optimizing current antitumor immunization strategies.","title":"Analysis of cytokine secretion by melanoma-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes.","pubmedId":"8528947"}
