In 4-hr 51Cr release assays, each TIL culture lysed only the autologous cryopreserved fresh or established melanoma line, but failed to lyse other melanoma tumors or K562 cells. Repeated stimulation of TIL with the autologous melanoma lines resulted in significant increases in anti-tumor CTL activity with no apparent loss in specificity. Stimulated cells have retained cytotoxic activity for up to 5 months in culture. Tumor cell CTL activity for both long-term TIL lines is inhibited by several mAbs, including those against CD3, CD8, and class I MHC molecules, indicating that the effector cells are class I-restricted CD8+, CTL. Furthermore, recognition of Ag on one of the established melanoma lines by TIL is restricted by HLA A-2. The availability of autologous tumor lines may prove clinically useful for the selective stimulation and expansion of cells with anti-tumor activity within a heterogeneous TIL population.","title":"Increased tumor-specific CTL activity in human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes stimulated with autologous tumor lines.","pubmedId":"2036681"}
