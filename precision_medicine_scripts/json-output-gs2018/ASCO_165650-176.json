According to the World Health Organization classification, HCTC is considered an oxyphilic variant of follicular thyroid carcinoma, but genomic dissection of HCTC revealed a unique class of thyroid malignancy distinct from papillary and follicular carcinoma. In the present study, we investigated if expression of miRNAs of interest is associated with occurrence of metastases in patients with HCTC. Methods: In 39 patients with HCTC ( 22 with non-metastatic and 17 with metastatic disease), the expression levels of six miRNAs (miR-138, miR-183, miR-221, miR-222, miR-768-3p, miR-885-5p) and U6 snRNA as endogenous control were determined in FFPE samples of primary tumor and normal thyroid tissue using TaqMan miRNA assays. Results: In patients with HCTC, miR-138 and miR-768-3p were downregulated in tumor samples compared to normal tissue (p \u003d 0.013 and p \u003d 0.010, respectively). These two miRNAs were also significantly downregulated in tumor samples of patients with metastatic disease (p \u003d 0.030 and p \u003d 0.048, respectively), but not in patients with non-metastatic disease (p \u003d 0.249 and p \u003d 0.101, respectively). In patients with non-metastatic disease miR-221and miR-885-5p were slightly, albeit significantly upregulated in tumor compared to normal tissue (p \u003d 0.042 and p \u003d 0.027, respectively). When fold change of miRNA expression in tumor versus normal samples was compared between patients with and without metastatic disease, significant downregulation of miR-183, miR-221 and miR-885-5p was observed in patients with metastatic disease (p \u003d 0.027, p \u003d 0.019 and p \u003d 0.024, respectively). Conclusions: Expression of miRNA (miR-183, miR-221, miR-885-5p) in tumor tissue is associated with occurrence of distant metastases in patients with HCTC.","title":"Expression of miRNA and occurrence of distant metastases in patients with Hrthle cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_165650-176"}
