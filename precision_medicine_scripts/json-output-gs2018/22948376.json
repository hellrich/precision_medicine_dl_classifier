Molecular genetic studies have revealed that deletions in CDKN2A occur frequently in cancer. Although p16 (INK4a) may be involved in tumor progression, the clinical impact and prognostic implications in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the immunohistochemical expression of p16 (INK4a) in 40 oropharynx and 35 larynx from HNSCC patients treated in a single institution and followed-up at least for 10 years in order to explore potential associations with clinicopathological outcomes and prognostic implications. Forty cases (53.3%) were positive for p16 (INK4a) and this expression was more intense in non-smoking patients (P \u003d 0.050), whose tumors showed negative vascular embolization (P \u003d 0.018), negative lymphatic permeation (P \u003d 0.002), and clear surgical margins (P \u003d 0.050). Importantly, on the basis of negative p16 (INK4a) expression, it was possible to predict a probability of lower survival (P \u003d 0.055) as well as tumors presenting lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.050) and capsular rupture (P \u003d 0.0010). Furthermore, increased risk of recurrence was observed in tumors presenting capsular rupture (P \u003d 0.0083). Taken together, the alteration in p16 (INK4a) appears to be a common event in patients with oropharynx and larynx squamous cell carcinoma and the negative expression of this protein correlated with poor prognosis.","title":"p16 (INK4a) has clinicopathological and prognostic impact on oropharynx and larynx squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"22948376"}
