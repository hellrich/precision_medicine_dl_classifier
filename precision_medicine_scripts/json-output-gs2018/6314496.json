Nevertheless, the incidence of lung cancer is increasing. No significant improvement in the curative treatment of non small cell lung cancer has been achieved in the last 20 years, and there has been no substantial improvement with surgical adjuvant therapies. Possible ways of improving current results are discussed. In contrast to non small cell lung cancer, treatment of small cell carcinoma has been improved substantially during the last 15 years and there is now a consistent percentage of longterm disease-free survivors.","title":"[Lung cancers--marking time?].","pubmedId":"6314496"}
