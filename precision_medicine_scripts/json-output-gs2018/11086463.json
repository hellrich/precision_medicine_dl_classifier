The authors report herein three long surviving patients in this series. [Case 1] A 49-year-old male. Distal gastrectomy was performed in November 1984. Metastasis to the liver occurred in June 1986. The right lobe of the liver was resected in November 1987 after transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). Although hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy was conducted, the cancer metastasized to the whole body, and the patient died in December 1991. [Case 2] A 65-year-old female. Distal gastrectomy was performed in July 1994. The left hepatic lobe and segment 5 in the right lobe were resected in June 1995. Although TAE was performed six times starting in December 1996, the patient died of hepatic failure in July 1999. [Case 3] A 73-year-old male. This patient simultaneously received distal gastrectomy and extended resection of the posterior hepatic segments in September 1997. Cancer recurred in the remaining liver in July 1998. Although microwave coagulation therapy (MCT) and TAE were performed, the patient died of hepatic failure in January 2000. In these patients who survived for a long period, the primary focus was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma under sufficient local control with metastasis limited to the nearest regional lymph nodes (group 1 lymph nodes). The patients could undergo interdisciplinary therapy, including hepatectomy, MCT, TAE, and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy.","title":"[Three long surviving patients with gastric cancer metastasizing to the liver under interdisciplinary therapy].","pubmedId":"11086463"}
