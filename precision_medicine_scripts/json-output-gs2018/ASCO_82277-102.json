Recent advances have identified oncogenic driver mutations in lung cancer that predict response to targeted therapies. However, knowledge resources are limited regarding the clinical relevance of such mutations.   Methods:  We performed a literature review regarding the prevalence and clinical significance of various treatments for ~40 mutations in 10 genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, MEK1, AKT1, HER2, PTEN, and ALK) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data from prospective and retrospective trials as well as preclinical studies was collected.   Results:  ~100 articles/abstracts were synthesized into the publicly available My Cancer Genome website (mycancergenome.org) which launched in Jan 2011. Content includes information about the oncogene pathway (e.g. What is EGFR-), the clinical significance of the gene for a specific type of cancer (e.g. EGFR in NSCLC), and a summary of clinically relevant data related to a particular gene mutation (e.g. EGFR Exon 19 deletion in NSCLC).  Information regarding mutation directed clinical trials open for accrual both at Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center and worldwide is provided using a direct query of clinicaltrials.gov. This decision support tool is integrated into Vanderbilts electronic medical record to provide actionable decision support for mutation directed treatment prioritization and clinical trial availability. Clinicians, patients, and researchers with access to the internet can also access the website freely and directly.   Conclusions:  My Cancer Genome is an international resource to assist clinicians in prioritizing genome directed cancer therapies.  The first implementation includes content for NSCLC.  We are now expanding the content to include melanoma, breast cancer, colon cancer and other malignancies. New data will be incorporated on an ongoing basis.  We welcome public/private partnerships to expand content and make this a truly global resource.","title":"My Cancer Genome: Web-based clinical decision support for genome-directed lung cancer treatment.","pubmedId":"ASCO_82277-102"}
