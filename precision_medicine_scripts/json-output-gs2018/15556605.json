Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a ligand of GPCR, is known as a tumor-promoting lipid, but its signaling pathways are not fully understood. We here demonstrated that S1P induces rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Met in gastric cancer cells, both of which have been proposed as prognostic markers of gastric cancers. The pathway of S1P-induced c-Met transactivation is Gi-independent and matrix metalloproteinase-independent, which differs from that of EGFR transactivation. Our results indicate that S1P acts upstream of various RTKs and thus may act as a potent stimulator of gastric cancer.","title":"Sphingosine 1-phosphate transactivates c-Met as well as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human gastric cancer cells.","pubmedId":"15556605"}
