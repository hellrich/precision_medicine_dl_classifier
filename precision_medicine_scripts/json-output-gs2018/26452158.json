It is now known that NGF is also associated with Alzheimer\u0027s disease and intractable pain, and hence, it, along with its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) A, is considered to be 1 of the new targets for therapies being developed to treat these diseases. Anti-NGF antibody and TrkA inhibitors are known drugs that suppress NGF/TrkA signaling, and many drugs of these classes have been developed thus far. Interestingly, local anesthetics also possess TrkA inhibitory effects. This manuscript describes the development of an analgesic that suppresses NGF/TrkA signaling, which is anticipated to be 1 of the new methods to treat intractable pain.
