Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was also found up-regulated in 80% of HNSCC. The interplay between miR-31 expression and EGFR signaling in HNSCC attract our attention and is worthy elucidating. In this study, we identified the up-regulation of miR-31, miR-181b and miR-222 in OSCC cells following EGF treatment and subsequent analysis showed that EGF treatment up-regulated miR-31 via the AKT signaling pathway and this phenomenon could be counteracted by curcumin, a natural compound with anti-neoplastic activity. EGF treatment and associated AKT activation up-regulated C/EBP expression, which was also attenuated by curcumin. Expression of miR-31 could be up-regulated by exogenous C/EBP and this was correlated with decreased FIH expression. Moreover, the up-regulation of miR-31 induced by EGF was abrogated by knockdown of C/EBP expression. In human HNSCC tissues the significant correlation between expressions of EGFR, C/EBP and miR-31 was also detected. This study demonstrated a novel scenario that the up-regulation of miR-31 in HNSCC could be a consequence of EGFR activation, which are mediated by both AKT and C/EBP signaling.","title":"MicroRNA-31 is upregulated by EGF through C/EBP signaling cascade in HNSCC","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-519"}
