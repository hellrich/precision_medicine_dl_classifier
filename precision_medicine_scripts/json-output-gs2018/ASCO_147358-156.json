Previous reports in gliomas, colon, breast and prostate cancer suggests that PTEN/PI3K pathway may be important for the induction of PD-L1 expression. This study explored the expression of PTEN/PI3K pathway and PD-L1 in MPM and its relationship with the patients prognosis Methods:    27 consecutive MPM patients were collected between 2000 and 2010. Paraffin-embedded biopsies were used for immunohistochemical profile quantified through the H-score method for PTEN/PI3K pathway. Staining with anti-PD-L1 (clone E1L3N) was considered positive in cases showing more than 1% expression of PD-L1. No systemic treatment prior to obtain the tumor sample. Staining results of each antibody were compared with clinical features Results:    Demographics: male/female (20/7); median age 68.4 (range 53.5-84.8 years); histology epithelial/no epithelial (19/8); PS 0/1/2 (3/21/3); stage III/IV (17/8). 20 patients were treated with chemotherapy. Median overall survival (OS) was 13 months. Expression of PTEN, mTOR, pAKT, p4EBP1, peif4E, pS6 and FOXO3a in MPM was found in 88.5%, 92.3%, 78.3%, 38.5%, 100%, 52.2% and 100% of tumors respectively. No correlations between proteins and age, performance status, stage, histology and response to chemotherapy. We found a significant correlation between peif4E, pAKT and FOXO3a expression and longer overall survival (p \u003c 0.05).PD-L1 was positive in 23.1% p. We found differences in expression PD-L1 according to histology: PD-L1 expression was more frequent in no-epithelial tumor (57% vs 10%,p \u003d 0.028) PD-L1 is a significant prognostic factor for OS, median survival for PD-L1 positive/negative patients was 5 vs 20 months (p \u003d 0.009). We did not identify significant association between the level of PD-L1 expression and alterations in PI3K pathway although a trend was observed for PTEN and pmTOR (p \u003e 0.05)    Conclusions:  This study shows PTEN/PI3K pathway and PD-L1 in MPM are frequently activated. PD-L1 is a negative prognostic factor for OS. With a limited number of patients, we did not observed association between PD-L1 and the involvement of the PI3K pathway in MPM.","title":"Analysis of expression of PTEN/PI3K pathway and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).","pubmedId":"ASCO_147358-156"}
