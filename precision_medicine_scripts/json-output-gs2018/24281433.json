According to the muscularis mucosae condition, CRCs were classified into three groups: type A, clearly identified; type B, incompletely disrupted with deformity; or type C, completely disrupted. We examined the relationship between the muscularis mucosae condition, clinicopathological findings, and lymph node (LN) metastasis.\nThe overall incidence of LN metastasis was 11.8 % (38/322): 0 % (0/46) for the type A group, 7.2 % (7/97) for the type B group, and 17.3 % (31/179) for the type C group. In univariate analysis of type B and C groups, unfavorable histologic grade, submucosal invasion of ≥1,000 μm, positive lymphatic invasion, high-grade tumor budding, and the type C group were associated with a significantly higher incidence of LN metastasis. In multivariate analysis, high-grade tumor budding (P \u003c 0.001, odds ratio [OR] \u003d 4.86), unfavorable histologic grade (P \u003d 0.026, OR \u003d 4.83), positive lymphatic invasion (P \u003c 0.001, OR \u003d 4.17), and the type C group (P \u003d 0.012, OR \u003d 3.38) were significantly associated with LN metastasis. The type C group showed a high incidence of moderate/severe lymphatic invasion.\nThe condition of the muscularis mucosae was an indicator of LN metastasis in T1 CRC.","title":"Condition of muscularis mucosae is a risk factor for lymph node metastasis in T1 colorectal carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24281433"}
