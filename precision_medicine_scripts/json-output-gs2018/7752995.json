THL present as a localized mass derived from the fixed tissue histiocyte which may or may not disseminate. MH originates from the circulating monocyte or tissue macrophage and is characterized by a syndrome of systemic symptoms, pancytopenia, adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting. The distinction between MH and THL is at times arbitrary and overlap exists between these syndromes. The clinicopathologic studies that defined these entities were performed prior to the development of immunophenotyping and other molecular techniques currently used to ensure proper classification of hematopoietic malignancies. Nine patients from the University of Minnesota originally diagnosed with MH were retrospectively analyzed using a panel of antibodies reactive against T cell, B cell, and myelomonocytic antigens. Only one patient was reclassified as a possible histiocytic malignancy after reevaluation. Similar immunophenotyping studies have also shown cases previously diagnosed as MH or THL express lymphoid antigens, and would now be classified as Ki-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) or some other hematopoietic neoplasm. These results indicate true histiocytic neoplasms are extremely rare, and previous concepts concerning clinical presentation and therapeutic outcome of the entities are inaccurate. In this paper we summarize the results of multiple retrospective analyses of cases previously diagnosed as MH or THL, including our experience at University of Minnesota, to illustrate the overall rarity of these entities. The current literature on malignant histiocytic disorders is reviewed, and the clinical presentation of patients determined to have histiocytic malignancies using contemporary analytical techniques is discussed.","title":"Malignant histiocytosis: a reassessment of cases formerly classified as histiocytic neoplasms and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"7752995"}
