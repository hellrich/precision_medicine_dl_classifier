Toremifene citrate, an anti-estrogenic compound, was incorporated into silica xerogel matrixes during polycondensation of organic silicate, tetraethyl ortho silicate (TEOS). The effects of drug amount, drying temperature and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the release rate of toremifene citrate and degradation of the silica xerogel matrixes were investigated. Addition of PEG (M(w) 4600/10000) decreased the specific surface area of the matrix and lowered the release rate of the drug. Reducing the amount of drug in the matrix also decreased the release rate of toremifene citrate. However, drying temperature did not affect the release rate of silica or toremifene citrate. The release profiles of toremifene citrate were according to zero order kinetics, suggesting that drug release was controlled by erosion of the silica xerogel matrix. These results suggest that the toremifene citrate release rate can be controlled to some extent by adding (PEG) or by varying the amount of drug in the silica xerogel matrix.","title":"Silica xerogel carrier material for controlled release of toremifene citrate.","pubmedId":"10675699"}
