Characterisation of a new gene, denoted APITD1, in the neuroblastoma tumour suppressor candidate region in chromosome 1p36.22 reveals that APITD1 contains a predicted TFIID-31 domain, representing the TATA box-binding protein-associated factor, TAF(II)31, which is required for p53-mediated transcription activation. Two different transcripts of this gene were shown to be ubiquitously expressed, one of them with an elevated expression in foetal tissues. Primary neuroblastoma tumours of all different stages showed either very weak or no measurable APITD1 expression, contrary to the level of expression observed in neuroblastoma cell lines. A reduced pattern of expression was also observed in a set of various tumour types. APITD1 was functionally tested by adding APITD1 mRNA to neuroblastoma cells, leading to the cell growth to be reduced up to 90% compared to control cells, suggesting APITD1 to have a role in a cell death pathway. Furthermore, we determined the genomic organisation of APITD1. Automated genomic DNA sequencing of the coding region of the gene as well as the promoter sequence in 44 neuroblastoma tumours did not reveal any loss-of-function mutations, indicating that mutations in APITD1 is not a common abnormality of neuroblastoma tumours. We suggest that low expression of this gene might interfere with the ability for apoptosis through the p53 pathway.","title":"A novel 1p36.2 located gene, APITD1, with tumour-suppressive properties and a putative p53-binding domain, shows low expression in neuroblastoma tumours.","pubmedId":"15328517"}
