This could potentially occur through a variety of mechanisms including the well-characterized ability of APC to negatively regulate Wnt signaling and decrease expression of target genes. However, recent findings suggest that the products of COX-2 elicit effects that occur upstream of the beta-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway. This review will focus on the regulation of COX-2 by APC and the interplay between COX-2 and the Wnt signaling pathway.","title":"The role of cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandins in colon cancer.","pubmedId":"17164142"}
