There are 4 different fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) in the cell: FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. The activation of FGFR pathway plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth, survival, as well as migration. Mutation or amplification/overexpresion of FGFR has been found in several types of tumors, including breast cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, multiple myeloma, and non-small cell lung carcinoma. Therefore, targeting FGFRs represents an attractive strategy for development of new cancer therapeutics. However, the lack of suitable models hinders the progress of research on FGFR inhibitors. Here we successfully validated subcutaneous models in several cancer types, in which FGFR is mutant or amplified/overexpressed, such as breast cancer MDA-MB-134 (FGFR1 amplification), gastric cancer SNU-16 (FGFR2 amplification), endometrial cancer AN3CA (FGFR2 N549K/K310R mutation), bladder cancer RT-4 (FGFR3 overexpression) and RT-112 (FGFR3 overexpression), lung cancer NCI-H1581 (FGFR1 amplification), as well as human derived gastric cancer GA114 (FGFR2 amplification). In conclusion, the validated cell line derived (CDX) and patient derived xenograft models (PDX) in several cancer types provide valuable platforms for the development of new compounds targeting FGFRs.","title":"Xenograft models for development of new drugs targeting fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3124"}
