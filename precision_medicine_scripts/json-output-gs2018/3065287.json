The familial type of malignant melanoma, however, is heterogeneous and not clearly defined. Three groups of familial malignant melanoma may be distinguished: malignant melanoma without additional skin disorders, melanoma associated with disturbances in the pigmentation system (including albinism, congenital nevi, and the dysplastic nevus syndrome), and malignant melanoma in other forms of genodermatosis. The most frequent variant of familial malignant melanoma is dysplastic nevus syndrome (a skin disease whose biologic and clinic importance has been fully recognized in the past decade).","title":"[Which malignant melanomas are genetically determined?].","pubmedId":"3065287"}
