Eligible patients included 151 patients with stage-I disease and 10 with stage-II regional lymphatic extension. A proportional hazards model was used to examine nine factors, of which five were not significant predictors of recurrence: age, sex, primary site, tumor diameter, and stage. Significant predictors included: measured depth p \u003d 7 X 10(-7); anatomic depth (Clark level), p \u003d 7 X 10(-6); NANA, p \u003d 0.003; and growth pattern (superficial spreading vs nodular), p \u003d 0.01. However, on multivariate analysis only two predictors were independent; measured depth and NANA. The latter could not be explained by non-specific factors. The data were examined to define optimal test values for assignment of risk. According to this model, patients with lesions greater than 1.75 mm and NANA less than 2 mumol/ml have a more than 12-fold greater risk of recurrence by 2 years than those with lesions less than or equal to 1.75 mm and NANA less than or equal to 2 mumol/ml.","title":"Prediction of malignant melanoma recurrence by serum N-acetylneuraminic acid.","pubmedId":"6832847"}
