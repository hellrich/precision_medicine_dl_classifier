To address this issue, we profiled 209 cholangiocarcinomas (CCAs) from Asia and Europe, including 108 cases caused by infection with the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini and 101 cases caused by non-O. viverrini-related etiologies. Whole-exome sequencing (n \u003d 15) and prevalence screening (n \u003d 194) identified recurrent somatic mutations in BAP1 and ARID1A, neither of which, to our knowledge, has previously been reported to be mutated in CCA. Comparisons between intrahepatic O. viverrini-related and non-O. viverrini-related CCAs demonstrated statistically significant differences in mutation patterns: BAP1, IDH1 and IDH2 were more frequently mutated in non-O. viverrini CCAs, whereas TP53 mutations showed the reciprocal pattern. Functional studies demonstrated tumor suppressive functions for BAP1 and ARID1A, establishing the role of chromatin modulators in CCA pathogenesis. These findings indicate that different causative etiologies may induce distinct somatic alterations, even within the same tumor type.
