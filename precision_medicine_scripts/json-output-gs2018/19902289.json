Knowledge of these features is the basis of the surgical concept of one or two-stage thyroidectomy, the exceptions and the concept of locoregional lymph node dissection. Lymph node surgery plays an important role in those cancers exhibiting mainly lymph node metastases (PTC, MTC) not only due to frequent recurrences but also due to its potential curative intent. Differentiated carcinomas may have an acceptable prognosis despite local invasion of the cervical aerodigestive system, thus resections are justified when technical prerequisites are given.","title":"[Surgery of thyroid carcinoma].","pubmedId":"19902289"}
