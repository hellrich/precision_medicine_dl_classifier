A potential use in therapeutic interventions is the periodic monitoring of cftDNA for the identification of molecular changes associated with resistance to target-specific treatments or when the mutational status in tumor tissue is not available. Methods:  Samples (6 ml) of peripheral blood were drawn from patients with colorectal (CRC, n\u003d 19) and thyroid (n\u003d 1) cancers and melanoma (n\u003d 8). CRC tumors were KRAS wild-type (n\u003d 3) or carried the BRAF V600E (n\u003d 6), KRAS G12D (n\u003d 9) and G12V (n\u003d 4) mutations. All melanomas and the thyroid cancer carried the BRAF V600E mutation. DNA was extracted from plasma with QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit to recover DNA fragments of 1000 bp. PCR amplification was carried out with a QX100 ddPCR System (Bio-Rad) on 20 L-samples containing cftDNA and TaqMan probes for BRAF V600E (1799T\u003eA), KRAS G12D (35G\u003eA) and G12V (35G\u003eT) labeled with FAM/VIC. Samples were then loaded into a droplet reader, which discriminates the difference in fluorescence amplitudes on the basis of target gene amplification. Results:  The concordance between mutations in tumors (T) and plasma (P) for BRAF V600E was: melanomas 8 T vs. 6 P; thyroid cancer 1 T vs. 0 P; CRC 6 T vs 3 P. Concerning KRAS in CRC the results were: G12D 9 T vs. 7 P, G12V 4 T vs. 0 P. Overall, the percentage of concordant samples were: V600E 60%, G12D 77,8%, G12V 0%. Interestingly, in 2 patients with wild-type KRAS tumor, the G12D and G12V mutations were found in plasma.  Conclusions:  ddPCR is a third-generation PCR technique for highly sensitive detection of DNA fragments. Detection of mutations in cftDNA by advanced technological platforms has important applications in the monitoring of patients for the occurrence of secondary mutations, amplifications and expansion of cell clones that render their tumors resistant to target-specific anticancer agents, unraveling the resistant phenotype before the clinical progression of the disease.
