We evaluated the percentage of positive nuclei and the intensity of the staining in immunohistochemically detected p53 and p21 genes expression.\nResults suitable for evaluation we obtained in 28 samples of malignant melanomas, one sample was not suitable for evaluation due to extremely high presence of melanin pigment. In 3 patients, weak nuclear p53 gene expression was detected in 5-15% of cells, in 1 patient, the very weak intensity of staining in 5-15% of cells was found. In three patients, in 5-15% of cells, weak expression of p21 gene, and in one patient, very weak expression of p21 gene in 5-15% of cells (in all 4 cases, the p53 expression was established) were found. In one of those 4 patients with p53 gene expression it was the malignant melanoma of the iris, in one of them it was malignant melanoma of the ciliary body, and in 2 of them it was malignant melanoma of the choroid.\nThe expression of the p53 gene and the expression of the gene p21 were established in 4 out of 28 patients (14.3%). From the above-mentioned results we can assume that stabilizing mutations of p53 gene are rare in the melanoma of the uvea. The proved expression p53 in 4 patients is probably result of the expression of the standard (wild-type) p53 gene, especially according to the ability to induce the expression of p21 gene. In our group, there were not proved marked nuclear accumulation of p53, which would suggest the presence of p53 gene mutation.","title":"[Immunohistochemical detection of the gene p53 and p21 expression in cells of the malignant melanoma of the uvea].","pubmedId":"18780655"}
