In schwannoma cell lines from patients with neurofibromatosis, loss of neurofibromin was previously shown to be associated with impaired regulation of GTP-Ras. Our analysis of other neural crest-derived tumor cell lines has shown that some melanoma and neuroblastoma cell lines established from tumors occurring in patients without neurofibromatosis contain reduced or undetectable levels of neurofibromin, with concomitant genetic abnormalities of the NF1 locus. In contrast to the schwannoma cell lines, GTP-Ras was appropriately regulated in the melanoma and neuroblastoma lines that were deficient in neurofibromin, even when c-H-ras was overexpressed in the lines. These results demonstrate that some neural crest tumors not associated with neurofibromatosis have acquired somatically inactivated NF1 genes and suggest a tumor-suppressor function for neurofibromin that is independent of Ras GTPase activation.","title":"Inactivation of the NF1 gene in human melanoma and neuroblastoma cell lines without impaired regulation of GTP.Ras.","pubmedId":"8516298"}
