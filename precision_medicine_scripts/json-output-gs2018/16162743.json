Overexpression of c-met has been demonstrated in lung cancer tissues and cell lines, but the expression of c-met in peripheral blood (circulating c-met) has not been addressed. The molecular monitoring of circulating c-met could be helpful for selecting patients for adjuvant therapy.\nTo investigate the expression of circulating c-met in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and to assess its prognostic implications.\nWe quantified the levels of c-met messenger RNA (mRNA) in paired tumor and normal lung tissues and their peripheral bloods in 45 patients with NSCLC by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The expression status of c-met protein in tumor tissues was further evaluated by immunohistochemistry.\nc-Met mRNA was significantly higher by 1.5 to 11 times in 34 of 45 tumor tissues (75.5%) than it was in their normal counterparts by real-time PCR. A comparison of this assay to immunohistochemistry suggested that real-time PCR was more sensitive than immunohistochemistry (27 of 45 tumor tissues, 60.0%) for the detection of c-met (p \u003d 0.016). Of these patients with overexpression of c-met in tumors, 67.6% (23 of 34 patients) expressed higher amounts of circulating c-met by 1.4 to 8 times that of the normal control subjects. In addition, overexpression of circulating c-met was significantly correlated with nodal (N) stage (p \u003d 0.011), but weakly correlated with tumor (T) stage (p \u003d 0.056) and overall stages (p \u003d 0.054) in patients with NSCLC. However, no correlations were found among circulating c-met and other factors such as age, gender, and pathologic types. Moreover, by univariate analysis, circulating c-met overexpression and pathologic stages (including T and N stages) were the most important factors correlated with early recurrence (p \u003c 0.05). Only the circulating c-met remained as an independent predictor of early recurrence (hazard ratio, 3.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 13.33; p \u003d 0.027) after Cox regression multivariate analysis.\nOverexpression of circulating c-met is significantly correlated with the N stage and early recurrence. Moreover, early recurrence is frequently noted in patients with overexpression of circulating c-met, indicating that circulating c-met is an independent negative prognostic indicator in NSCLC.","title":"Overexpression of circulating c-met messenger RNA is significantly correlated with nodal stage and early recurrence in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"16162743"}
