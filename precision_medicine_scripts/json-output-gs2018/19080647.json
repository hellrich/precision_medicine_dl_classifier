Group I (n \u003d 40) underwent irradiation at the dose of 40 - 45 Gy 5 times a week on the primary tumor and the lymph nodes with the size \u003e or \u003d 10 mm in short axis, and receiving intravenous drip of OXA 85 mg/m2 for 2 h, intravenous injection of LV 200 mg/m2, and then intravenous injection of 5-fu 300 mg/m2, followed by continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fu 500 mg/m2, for 22 h, with 2 weeks as a cycle. Three cycles of chemotherapy were given during the radiotherapy. Then operative evaluation was conducted. Those resectable underwent operation and then 3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Those un-resectable underwent continuous 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Group II (n \u003d 43) received only chemotherapy. The treatment was repeated until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity.\n38 patients were evaluated in Group I, the result showed complete remission (CR) in 4 patients (10.5%), partial remission (PR) in 23(60.5%), no-change (NC) in 7(18.4%), progressive disease (PD) in 5(13.2%), with the remission rate (RR) of 71% (27/40). 42 patients were evaluated in Group II, the result showed CR in 3 patients (7.14%), PR in 16(14.3%), NC in 13(30.9%), and PD in 9(26.2%)with the RR of 45% (19/43). The resection rates of Groups I and II were 32.5% and 27.9% respectively (P \u003d 0.649). The R0 resection rates of Groups I and II were 77.8% and 57.1% respectively (P \u003d 0.161). The mean survival times of the resectable patients in Groups I and II were 45 months and 28 months respectively, and the 2-year overall survival (OS) of the resectable patients in Groups I and II were 65.8% and 56.3% respectively (P \u003d 0.371). The mean survival times of the un-resectable patients in Groups I and II were 14 months and 9 months respectively, and the 2-year OS rates of the un-resectable patients in Groups I and II were 28.3% and 20.7% respectively (P \u003d 0.017). The toxic and adverse effects included gastrointestinal and hematological toxicity. There was no treatment-related death.\nRadiotherapy combined with concurrent chemotherapy may be an effective and well-tolerated regimen in patients with advanced and metastatic gastric cancer.","title":"[Efficacy of oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin calcium combined with concurrent radiotherapy for local advanced gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"19080647"}
