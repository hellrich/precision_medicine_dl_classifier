Despite the improvement of therapeutic approaches, reducing high mortality is still the major challenge of OSCC. However, the molecular pathogenesis of OSCC remains largely unclear, which hinders the development of effective preventive and therapeutic methods. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA has been implicated to be involved in tumorigenesis. Splicing factors play key roles in the regulation of alternative splicing. HnRNP A1 is an important multi-function splicing factor and closely related to tumorigenesis. It has been reported to be overexpressed in multiple types of tumors. However, the function of A1 in cell cycle and proliferation remains unclear. We found that hnRNP A1 was overexpressed in OSCC tissues and cells by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Down-regulation of hnRNP A1 with siRNA significantly retarded the growth of OSCC cells and induced G2/M arrest. DNA chip assay showed that the expression of a number of target genes associated with G2/M phase are regulated by hnRNP A1. These findings suggest that hnRNP A1 plays key roles in the regulation of cell cycle progression and pathogenesis of OSCC.","title":"HnRNP A1 regulates cell cycle and proliferation in oral squamous cancer cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-3776"}
