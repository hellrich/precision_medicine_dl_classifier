The clinicopathologic parameters analyzed were patients\u0027 age, histological types, and tumor grade. The Her-2/neu Dako scoring system was used.\nDuring the 5-year period, 83 histologically confirmed cases of invasive breast carcinoma were assessed for Her-2/neu status. These included 67 (80.7%) cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, nine cases of invasive lobular carcinoma (10.8%), three cases of medullary carcinoma (3.6%), two cases of papillary carcinoma (2.4%), and a case each of mucinous and clear cell carcinoma (1.2%). Mean age of patients was 48.9 Â± 13.6 years with an age range of 25 to 83 years. Only nine (10.8%) cases showed immunopositivity for Her-2/neu. Seven of these were cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, while two were invasive lobular carcinoma. Tumors were predominantly high grade with grade III, II, and I accounting for 42, 28, and 13 cases, respectively. There was no significant correlation between patient age, the various histological types, tumor grade, and Her-2/neu positivity.\nThis study indicates that Her-2/neu may not be useful in defining the prognosis of breast cancer in this environment. Nevertheless, it highlights the need for routine immunostaining for Her-2/neu before institution of trastuzumab (Herceptin) therapy.","title":"Immunohistochemical detection of Her-2/neu overexpression in breast carcinoma in Nigerians: a 5-year retrospective study.","pubmedId":"22037080"}
