This report describes for the first time the case of a patient with past occupational exposure to asbestos and no family history of cancer who developed 2 rare primary malignancies: a cardiac sarcoma and a gliosarcoma 11 months later. Molecular-cytogenetic studies did not identify common lesions to these 2 rare metachronous sarcomas. The gliosarcoma was associated with monosomy 10 and underlying PTEN monoallelic loss, which has been recurrently observed. In the cardiac sarcoma, MDM2 amplification and CDKN2AB/9p21 biallelic deletion suggested intimal sarcoma. No causal relationship was found between cardiac sarcoma and asbestos exposure, although MDM2 abnormalities were linked to malignant mesothelioma.
