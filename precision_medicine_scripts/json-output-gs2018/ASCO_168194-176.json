We developed a multi-modality colorectal cancer profile useful for clinical management. Methods: 133 Colorectal cancer samples were profiled with our platform, which includes 1) 21 gene mutation analysis using deep sequencing (ca. 15K reads), 2) MSI status, 3) MLH1 Promoter Methylation, 4) MET amplification and PTEN deletion by FISH, and 5) PD-L1 expression (30% of samples) by IHC. Results: 99% of tumors contained at least 1 mutation found by NGS. The most commonly observed mutations were TP53(85%), KRAS (49%), PIK3CA(26%), BRAF(19%), EGFR(16.5%), NRAS(8%), FGFR3(6%), HRAS(5%), KIT (5%), SMO(5%), JAK3(5%), and ERBB2(5%). 39 patients had a TP53 mutation allele frequency consistent with germline mutations, raising the possibility of a LiFraumeni syndrome. Most tumors (51%) also had at least 1 abnormal non-sequencing result. The most common findings were PTEN deletion (25%), MLH1(17%) methylation, MSI(11%), PDL1 (17.5%) overexpression. PTEN/MET/PDL1 was anticorrelated to MSH/MLH status. (p \u003c 0.05). Our integrated profile (NGS, FISH, MSI, MLH) robustly recapitulated hypermutation profiles that were associated with BRAF+/MLH+/MSH+ profiles using comprehensive WGS in a recent TCGA study. In addition, 25%(10) were KRAS-/MLH-/MSH-/BRAF- of unknown prognosis without PTEN deletion status. The integrated profile also identified ~2 percent (3/131) of patients as candidates for Lynch Syndrome testing (MSH+/MLH-/BRAF- and \u003c 50 years). Conclusions: Multimodality Colorectal Cancer profiling identified patients with potential new targeted therapy. Specifically, we identified a significant number of cases that were PTEN, PI3KCA, HRAS, FGFR3, MET, KIT, ERBB2, and PDL1 positive that change treatment options. In addition, to identifying patients with prognostic status (e.g.BRAF+, MSI+/MLH+), we identified important candidates for Lynch syndrome testing or possibly Li-Fraumeni Syndrome who would benefit from alternative treatments and different management.","title":"Clinical support with integrated multimodality molecular profiling for colorectal tumors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_168194-176"}
