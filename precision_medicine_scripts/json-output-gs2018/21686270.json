Pathogenetic roles of these melanoma-prone mutations and their genetic interactions have been established in genetically engineered mouse models. Here, we catalog frequent genetic alterations observed in human melanomas and describe mouse models of melanoma initiation and progression, including our recent study that investigated the genetic interactions of RAS activation and PTEN loss in a CDKN2A (INK4a/ARF) null melanoma prone genetic background. We showed that loss of PTEN cooperates with HRAS activation, leading to increased development of melanoma and emergence of metastasis. Moreover, we observed that RNA i-mediated PTEN inactivation in RAS-driven melanomas enhanced migration and invasion with concomitant downregulation of E-cadherin, the major regulator of epithelial and mesenchymal transition, and enhanced AKT2 phosphorylation, which has been previously linked to invasion and metastasis of several cancer types, including breast and ovary. These data show that activated RAS cooperates with PTEN loss in melanoma genesis and progression.","title":"Cooperative interactions of PTEN deficiency and RAS activation in melanoma metastasis.","pubmedId":"21686270"}
