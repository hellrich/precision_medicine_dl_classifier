This report presents a 67-year-old man with both esophageal and bronchial perforations that occurred after descending thoracic aortic aneurysm replacement. Surgical repair was performed, but the lesions perforated again. Two covered metallic stent prostheses introduced into both the esophagus and left main bronchus led to the improvement of mediastinitis by sealing the perforations. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing successful treatment for esophageal and bronchial perforations using covered metallic stents. Placement of covered metallic stents can be an option for the treatment of patients with esophagorespiratory tract perforations, especially those who are in critical condition.","title":"Esophageal and bronchial perforations after thoracic aortic aneurysm replacement: successful repair with covered metallic stents.","pubmedId":"14753315"}
