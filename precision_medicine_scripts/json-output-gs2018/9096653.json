In this study we examined the efficacy of tumor vaccines comprised of unfractionated tumor material presented by professional antigen-presenting cells (APC): dendritic cells (DC) or macrophages (M phi). To enhance the relevance of these studies for human patients we used 2 poorly immunogenic murine tumor models and evaluated the effectiveness of the vaccination protocols in tumor-bearing animals. APC (in particular DC) pulsed with unfractionated extracts from these \"poorly immunogenic\" tumors were highly effective in eliciting tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. A measurable CTL response could be detected after even a single immunization with tumor extract-pulsed DC. DC or M phi pulsed with tumor extract were also effective vaccines in tumor-bearing animals. In the murine bladder tumor (MBT-2) model a modest extension of survival and 40% cure rate was seen in the animal groups immunized with DC or M phi pulsed with MBT-2 tumor extract. DC or M phi pulsed with B16/F10.9 tumor extract were also remarkably effective in the B16 melanoma lung metastasis model, as shown by the observation that treatment with APC caused a significant reduction in lung metastases. Cumulatively, the CTL and immunotherapy data from the two murine tumor systems suggest that APC (in particular DC) pulsed with unfractionated cell extracts as a source of tumor antigen may be equally or more effective than genetically modified tumor vaccines.","title":"Regression of tumors in mice vaccinated with professional antigen-presenting cells pulsed with tumor extracts.","pubmedId":"9096653"}
