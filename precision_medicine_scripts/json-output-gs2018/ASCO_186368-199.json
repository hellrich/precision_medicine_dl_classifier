Neratinib is a HER2/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor being evaluated for use in ERBB2 mutated breast cancer. Neratinib has been found to have clinical activity on heavily pre-treated ERBB2 mutant breast cancer patients. We are evaluating the response and genomic profiles of 3 postmenopausal patients with metastatic ERBB2 mutant/non-amplified breast cancer receiving neratinib and fulvestrant NCT01953926, NCT01670877. Methods: Samples were collected at different points during treatment and CTCs were identified. Other representative cells were tracked but not classified as CTCs. CD45-CK+ cells with cytoplasmic and/or nuclear apoptosis were defined as CTC-Apoptotic. CD45- cells expressing little to no CK but otherwise meeting morphological criteria for CTCs are CTC-LowCK. CD45-CK+ cells with small nuclear size are CTC-SmallCK. Single CTCs will be analyzed using whole genome copy number variation to determine chromosomal alterations. Results: The patients had an average of 4.7 lines of therapy for metastatic disease before neratinib. Two had stable disease and one had progression. The patient who progressed had a rise in the number of CTCs from 37 to 52 cells/ml and drop in apoptotic cells from 5 to 0 cells/ml. Conclusions: The high CTC count of the patient who progressed may suggest more aggressive disease. The drop in the apoptotic cell count may correlate with a failure to respond to therapy. Samples have been sent for copy number variation profiling. The goal is to identify any genomic amplifications or deletions associated with clinical response and progression after targeted therapy. We hope to demonstrate the timeframe of tumor evolution in response to therapy and provide a framework for the use of fluid biopsies to monitor disease progression.
