P127 and p. I130) and IDH2 mutations (p. R140) was 14.6% (14/ 96) and 2.17% (2/96) respectively. The IDH1 mutations of p. P127 and p. I130 were not reported so far in literature. Of 14 IDH1 mutation patients, 10 were with normal karyotype and the differences had statistical significance (P\u003d0.021). Two patients with IDH2 mutation were also with normal karyotype. IDH2 mutations were in older patients at diagnosis. Patients with IDH mutation had higher white blood cell counts, lower platelet counts, expression of HLA-DR, CD34, CD33 and CD13, lower remission rate and higher relapse rate.\nIDH mutation is recurring genetic change in AML and indicates poor prognosis.","title":"[Clinical significance of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia].","pubmedId":"22338155"}
