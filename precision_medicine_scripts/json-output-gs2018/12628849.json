A common polymorphism at codon 72 of exon 4 encoding either arginine (Arg) or proline (Pro) has been shown to affect HPV-mediated degradation of p53 in vitro, and may represent a risk factor for HPV-induced carcinogenesis. The presence of HPV DNA as well as the TP53 polymorphism at codon 72 of exon 4 were investigated in a series of 45 penile SCC. HPV detection and typing were carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with generic primers (MY09-MY11 and FAP59-FAP64), and type-specific DNA probes. TP53 polymorphism was further investigated using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). HPV DNA was detected in 67% of penile SCC and 32% of benign lesions (BL) (P\u003c0.05). Among the TP53 amplified samples, the rate of Arg homozygosity in penile SCC was 61% compared with 68% in BL (non-significant (NS)). Our results demonstrate a strong association between penile SCC and the presence of HPV DNA. The TP53 Arg/Arg genotype does not appear to represent a risk factor for the development of genital SCC in men, and no correlation was found between the TP53 polymorphism at codon 72 and the presence of HPV DNA.","title":"Detection of the human papillomavirus and analysis of the TP53 polymorphism of exon 4 at codon 72 in penile squamous cell carcinomas.","pubmedId":"12628849"}
