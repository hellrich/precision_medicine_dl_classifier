It is the third most common skin cancer and is one of the most biologically unpredictable neoplasms. Sunlight is an important etiological factor in cutaneous melanoma. Oral melanoma is relatively uncommon, exhibiting a definite predilection for palate and maxillary gingiva, and is twice as common in males as in females. We herewith report three cases of oral melanoma out of which two occurred on the palate and one in the maxillary gingiva. Their clinical presentations, histopathology and management are discussed.","title":"Malignant melanoma of the oral cavity--case reports and review of literature.","pubmedId":"15751785"}
