The mean size of adenomas was 13.5 +/- 14.2 mm (95% CI 10.5-16.5) in APC-positive, and 13.8 +/- 15.5 mm (95% CI 7.8-19.8) in APC-negative adenomas (P \u003d 0.364). Statistical analysis revealed no difference between APC-positive and negative adenomas as to the histological type (P \u003d 0.327) and grade of dysplasia (P \u003d 0.494). We found that even advanced adenomas did not differ in their APC status from the non-advanced tumors (P \u003d 0.414). Finally, no difference was found when the location (P \u003d 0.157), macroscopic appearance (P \u003d 0.571) and age of patients (P \u003d 0.438) were analysed and compared between both APC positive and negative adenomas.\nMost adenomas expressed full-length APC protein, suggesting that protein expression is not a reliable marker for assessment of APC gene mutation. Complete loss of APC protein did not influence morphology, location, or appearance of adenomas, nor was it affected by the patient\u0027s age.","title":"Deficiency of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli protein in sporadic colorectal adenomas and its associations with clinical phenotype and histology.","pubmedId":"16804979"}
