Levels were studied in 53 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma receiving chemoimmunotherapy and in 19 control patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving a similar immunotherapy regimen. The serum S100B level was elevated in 81% of the patients before treatment. Marker levels were significantly higher in patients who did not respond (n \u003d 22). Patients with S100B levels \u003eor\u003d 1.0 microg/l were less likely to obtain remission or stable disease than the group with normal or moderately elevated serum concentrations (P \u003c 0.01). After treatment, 17 of the 31 (55%) patients with stable or responsive disease had a S100B serum level below the cut-off point versus only one of the 22 (5%) patients in the group with progressive disease. For LDH the proportions of patients were 17 out of 31 (55%) and nine out of 22 (41%), respectively. In 15 melanoma patients there was a transient rise in the level of serum S100B at the beginning of systemic therapy. All 19 patients in the control group had an initial serum S100B level \u003cor\u003d 0.16 microg/l, but nine showed a transient rise during immunotherapy. In conclusion, S100B levels are of value for predicting the response to and for monitoring patients during chemoimmunotherapy.","title":"Serum S100B is suitable for prediction and monitoring of response to chemoimmunotherapy in metastatic malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"12569284"}
