Inhibition of Ras primary occurs through Spreds ability to bind and localize NF1, a RasGAP and major tumor suppressor, to the plasma membrane. Loss-of-function Spred1 and NF1 mutations occur across multiple cancer types including melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, stomach carcinoma, and uterine carcinosarcoma. Here we demonstrate that oncogenic EGFR signaling disrupts Spred1-NF1 binding. Mass spectrometry was performed on cells overexpressing EGFRL858R to identify potential phosphorylation sites on Spred1 and NF1 that could disrupt Spred1-NF1 binding by steric hindrance. A serine phosphorylation site on Spred1 was identified in which a phosphomimetic and phosphodeficient mutant decreased or increased Spred1-NF1 binding, respectively. Therefore, phosphorylation of Spred1 at this site by a serine kinase downstream of oncogenic EGFR may disrupt Spred1-NF1 binding. Our findings provide one potential mechanism by which oncogenic EGFR signaling disrupts negative feedback to allow for constitutive Ras signaling. Furthermore, this work may elucidate a novel kinase therapeutic target for restoring NF1 mediated inhibition of Ras.","title":"Oncogenic EGFR signaling inhibits the Spred1-NF1 interaction to sustain constitutive Ras signaling","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1874"}
