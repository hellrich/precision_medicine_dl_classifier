To date, no case of the salvage robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) following heavy ion radiotherapy (HIRT) has been published. We report on a 70-year-old man with a history of HIRT for prostate cancer in 2011. For 3 years after. HIRT, his serum PSA levels were permissible range. However, his PSA levels were increased. We had diagnosis localized prostate cancer after HIRT. We had carried out salvage RARP. Until 10 months after salvage RARP, his PSA level was not detectable.
