The spectrum of malignant melanomas comprises the four main types, superficial spreading malignant melanoma, nodular malignant melanoma, lentigo-maligna melanoma and acrolentiginous malignant melanoma. In addition the rare spitzoid malignant melanoma, desmoplastic malignant melanoma as well as some unusual variants of malignant melanoma can be distinguished. The latter include nevoid malignant melanoma, a form of malignant melanoma resembling benign melanocytic nevi, animal type malignant melanoma, an atypical melanocytic neoplasm with numerous melanophages and prominent melanosis resembling an atypical epithelioid blue naevus as well as regressive malignant melanoma, and representing a questionably distinct entity, balloon cell and signet-ring malignant melanomas, melanoma types with degenerative clear cell changes, as well as myxoid and osteogenic malignant melanomas that are characterized by unusual stromal changes.","title":"[Uncommon variants of malignant melanocytic neoplasms].","pubmedId":"17846776"}
