Laboratory analyses were performed by HPLC (L-DOPA, L-tyrosine), immunoassays (S100B, MIA) and colourimetry (LDH).\nAll markers, except LDH, were elevated in stage IV versus other stages. S100B and MIA highly correlated, especially in stage IV (r(s): 0.849, p\u003c0.001). The combination of L-DOPA/tyrosine ratio with S100B displayed the highest sensitivity/specificity (73/70%) to confirm stage III-IV or stage IV alone (69/75%) (ROC optimised cut-off). Only the L-DOPA/tyrosine ratio significantly increased (+36% over 5 months, p\u003d0.001) during progression from stage I-III to higher stages. S100B, MIA and LDH, but not the L-DOPA/tyrosine ratio, responded to progression towards death in stage IV. All markers exhibited a prognostic value in deceased patients (n\u003d44); S100B and MIA were the best predictors of survival time by Cox proportional-hazards regression.\nThe combination of plasma L-DOPA/tyrosine ratio and S100B appears an attractive approach for the biological follow-up of melanoma patients.","title":"Clinical value of combined determination of plasma L-DOPA/tyrosine ratio, S100B, MIA and LDH in melanoma.","pubmedId":"17276671"}
