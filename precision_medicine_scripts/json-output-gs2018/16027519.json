Imatinib was evaluated both alone and in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) primary cultures and established cell lines representing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Over 90% of ACC tumors are c-kit-positive, and these primary cultures proved to be of short-term usefulness in assessing chemosensitivity. Interaction was determined over a wide range of drug combinations using a statistical three-dimensional analysis model. Both ACC short-term cultures and HNSCC cell lines were demonstrated to have a response ranging from additive to synergistic when imatinib and cisplatin were combined. The interaction of imatinib on cisplatin-induced DNA cross-linking was further investigated using the comet-X assay. In contrast, significant antagonism was observed when imatinib and gemcitabine were combined. Since gemcitabine is activated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the effect of imatinib on this enzyme was investigated. A dose-dependent inhibition of dCK was observed, highlighting this kinase as a possible additional secondary molecular target for imatinib. This work demonstrates a synergistic interaction between cisplatin and imatinib, which may prove to be clinically relevant in the future management of both ACC and HNSCC.","title":"Synergistic effects of imatinib (STI 571) in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs in head and neck cancer.","pubmedId":"16027519"}
