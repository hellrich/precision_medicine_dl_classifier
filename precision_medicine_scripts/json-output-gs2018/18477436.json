NBCCS is a genetic disorder transmitted by an autosomal dominant gene with variable expressivity, which is important to recognize when a patient has multiple OKCs. The cysts of the jaws are among the most common findings. Another feature is a certain appearance of the face, such as: large calvaria, high-arched eyebrows, broad nasal root, and mild hypertelorism. Before-therapy diagnosis is, therefore, as important as after-therapy diagnosis. Genetic counseling and examination may also be indicated. The purpose of this paper was to present a family case report of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome with multiple odontogenic keratocysts. The features identified by these combined clinical, imaging, and histologic findings are described, along with a brief mention of the family history and a review of the literature.","title":"Familial multiple odontogenic keratocysts.","pubmedId":"18477436"}
