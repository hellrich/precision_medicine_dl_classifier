All patients underwent surgical intervention (gross total resection, n \u003d 35; subtotal resection, n \u003d 38; stereotactic biopsy, n \u003d 30). Subsequently all patients were offered radiotherapy and chemotherapy with CCNU. Results were as follows: 101 patients started radiotherapy, 93 patients completed it (96% of the patients aged \u003c 65 years and 85% of the patients \u003e or \u003d65 years). All patients received at least 1 cycle of chemotherapy (median 3 cycles). Chemotherapy-associated toxicity was generally mild, more pronounced in females and did not increase with age. Median time to progression was 10.5+/-3.2 months for the patients \u003c 65 years and 5.1+/-1 months for patients \u003e or \u003d65 years. median overall survival was 17.5+/-3.8 months in patients \u003c 65 years and 8.6+/-1 months in patients \u003e or \u003d65 years (p \u003c 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, age and female sex remained independent prognostic factors. Our data indicate that a treatment concept including concomitant radio- and chemotherapy is feasible even in elderly patients with GBM.","title":"Feasibility and toxicity of CCNU therapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma multiforme.","pubmedId":"12569300"}
