Western blotting was performed in samples of 10 gastric cancers and corresponding cancer-adjacent tissues. Hp infection was detected in 47 patients by fast urea enzyme test and (13)C breath test.\nThe results of immunohistochemistry showed that the positive expressions of COX-2, EGFR and VEGF in gastric carcinoma were 59.02%, 36.07% and 60.66%, respectively, significantly higher than that in the normal mucosa (25.00%, 0 and 30.00%, respectively). There was a positive correlation between the expression of COX-2, EGFR and VEGF and gastric carcinoma. The expression of COX-2 and EGFR was 75.76% and 45.45% in the gastric carcinomas with Hp infection, significantly higher than that in those without (28.57% and 14.29%). The protein expression of COX-2, EGFR and VEGF detected by Western blot in gastric carcinomas was also significantly higher than that in normal mucosa.\nCOX-2, EGFR and VEGF are overexpressed in gastric carcinoma, and there is a positive correlation among them. Hp infection may upregulate the expression of COX-2 and EGFR in gastric cancer tissues.","title":"[Correlation of Helicobacter pylori infection with the expression of COX-2 and EGFR and VEGF in human gastric carcinoma].","pubmedId":"19173907"}
