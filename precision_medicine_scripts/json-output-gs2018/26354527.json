Efficacy of afatinib in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naïve (TKI-naïve) patients with uncommon EGFR mutations (other than exon 19 deletions or exon 21 point mutations) has been reported; however, efficacy in TKI-pretreated patients with uncommon EGFR mutations is unknown.\nIn the afatinib compassionate use program (CUP), patients with advanced or metastatic, histologically confirmed NSCLC progressing after at least one line of chemotherapy and one line of EGFR-TKI treatment were enrolled. Demographic data, mutation type, response rates, time to treatment failure (TTF), and safety in patients harboring uncommon EGFR mutations were reported.\nIn 60 patients (63% female, median age 63 years [range: 30-84 years]), a total of 66 uncommon EGFR mutations including 30 T790M mutations were reported (18.4% and 11%, respectively, of known EGFR mutations within the CUP). Most patients (67%) received afatinib as third- or fourth-line treatment. Median TTF was 3.8 months (range: 0.2 to \u003e24.6 months; p \u003d .244) in patients with uncommon mutations compared with 5.1 months (range: 0.1 to \u003e21.1 months) in patients with common mutations (n \u003d 165). Pronounced activity was observed with E709X mutations (TTF \u003e12 months). No new safety signals were detected.\nAfatinib is clinically active and well tolerated in many TKI-pretreated NSCLC patients harboring uncommon EGFR mutations. Compared with results reported in TKI-naïve patients, activity was also indicated in patients with T790M and exon 20 insertion mutations.","title":"Afatinib in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring Uncommon EGFR Mutations Pretreated With Reversible EGFR Inhibitors.","pubmedId":"26354527"}
