This benefit can also be predicted using gene expression-based molecular subtypes of gliomas while the predictive value of the IDH mutation in this context requires further study. In elderly patients with glioblastoma, the analysis of MGMT methylation status in two phase III trials suggests that this alteration may guide treatment decisions; however, this finding still needs confirmation in prospective studies. Omics and next-generation sequencing studies have identified additional potential predictive markers. In particular, IDH mutations, BRAF V600E mutations and FGFR gene fusions might predict efficacy of therapies targeted against these alterations.\nCurrently, the 1p/19q codeletion is the only well established predictive marker with clinical utility. However, it is likely that other molecular markers such as MGMT methylation, IDH mutation and those identified using omics and next-generation sequencing studies will further guide treatment decisions in adult gliomas.","title":"Predictive biomarkers in adult gliomas: the present and the future.","pubmedId":"24076583"}
