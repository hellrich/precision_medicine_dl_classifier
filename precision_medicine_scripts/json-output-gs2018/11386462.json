Recent genetic studies have identified the presence of germline missense mutations in the RET proto-oncogene in almost 100% of MEN-2 patients. We report here three generations of one MEN-2 family with rare missense mutation at codon 618 (Cys--\u003eArg) of the RET proto-oncogene. The first patient was surgically treated at the age of 63 years but died of bone metastasis. His two children (29-year-old daughter and 25-year-old son) were treated surgically for MTC and neck lymph node metastasis. Germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene of these three MTC patients and two children of the 29-year-old daughter (9-year-old female and 7-year-old male) were examined. Three MTC patients and the 9-year-old female possessed the mutation. The phenotype of the family with this rare point mutation of the RET proto-oncogene is reported.","title":"A family of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A with the RET proto-oncogene mutation in codon 618 (Cys--\u003eArg).","pubmedId":"11386462"}
