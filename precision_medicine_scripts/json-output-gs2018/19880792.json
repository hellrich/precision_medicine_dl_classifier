Normal thyrocytes (PC Cl 3) were used as control.\nBoth compounds inhibited the proliferation of BRAF mutant cell lines, but not normal thyrocytes, with a half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) ranging from 78-113 nm for PLX4720 and from 29-97 nm for PLX4032. Doses equal to or higher than 500 nm were required to achieve a similar effect in BRAF wild-type cancer cells. Phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and MAPK kinase (MEK) 1/2 decreased upon PLX4032 and PLX4720 treatment in BRAF mutant thyroid carcinoma cells but not in normal thyroid cells or in cell lines harboring mutations of RAS or RET/PTC1 rearrangements. PLX4032 and PLX4720 treatment induced a G(1) block and altered expression of genes involved in the control of G(1)-S cell-cycle transition. 8505C cell tumor xenografts were smaller in nude mice treated with PLX4032 than in control mice. This inhibition was associated with reduction of phospho-ERK and phospho-MEK levels.\nThis study provides additional evidence of the promising nature of mutant BRAF as a molecular target for thyroid carcinoma cells.","title":"Cytostatic activity of adenosine triphosphate-competitive kinase inhibitors in BRAF mutant thyroid carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"19880792"}
