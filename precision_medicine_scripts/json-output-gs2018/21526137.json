Here, we report the case of a 73-year-old Japanese man with a well-differentiated (WD) liposarcoma of the mesentery. Due to rapid growth of the abdominal mass and abdominal insufficiency, a tumorectomy was performed. The excised tumor was 12.4 Ã— 9.6 cm in size and weighed 548 g. Cut sections showed a lobulated yellow and/or grayish-colored appearance. The histological features were predominantly those of the sclerotic and lipoma-like variants of WD liposarcoma. The cytoplasm of most spindle cells was diffusely immunoreactive for CD34, while fat cells were positive for S-100 protein. Some spindle cell nuclei were positive for CDK4, and a few were positive for MDM2. The average Ki-67 proliferation index in tumor cells was 10%, and androgen receptor expression was detected in tumor cell nuclei. The present case and 11 cases identified from a literature search were reviewed. The WD mesenteric liposarcomas developed in patients in the fourth to seventh decades of life (mean age 57.9 years). The patients consisted of 7 men and 5 women. All tumors were larger than 10 cm in diameter at the time of surgery. Complete resection might be the only curative therapy for WD liposarcomas of the mesentery, but long-term follow-up is needed because of the possibility of a local recurrence of the tumor.","title":"Well-differentiated liposarcoma, an atypical lipomatous tumor, of the mesentery: a case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"21526137"}
