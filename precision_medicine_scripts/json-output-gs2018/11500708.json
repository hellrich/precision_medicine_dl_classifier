The purpose of this study is to analyze the clinical profile of the Yemeni patients of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and to evaluate the possible relationship to kath chewing.\nWith the help of a special protocol, all the patients of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma seen between October 1997 and December 1998 at the Ear, Nose and Throat and Dermatology Clinics of Saudi Hospital, Hajjah, Yemen Republic were subjected to detailed analysis. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic studies in all the cases.\nAll the 36 patients (23 male and 13 female) were Yemani nationals, aged 18 to 80 years (median age 50 years). Thirty patients were Kath addicts. The tumor was localized to the oral cavity in 17 (47%) patients, oropharynx in 1 (3%) patient, nasopharynx in 15 (42%) patients and larynx in 3 (8%) patients.\nThe incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma seems to be relatively high, especially the oral squamous cell carcinoma, all of whom had a habit of kath chewing, which may be considered as an important contributing factor.","title":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in Hajjah, Yemen.","pubmedId":"11500708"}
