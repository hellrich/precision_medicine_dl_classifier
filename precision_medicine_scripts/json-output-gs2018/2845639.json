ER-immunoreactivity (ER-IR) was positive in 30 (27.8%) of the 108 gastric carcinomas examined. ER-IR was located in the nucleus of cancer cells. The incidence of ER-IR positive gastric carcinoma was not significantly different between male and female cases. However, the positive tumour cells were observed in 28 (39.4%) out of the 71 poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, the incidence being significantly higher than that in well differentiated adenocarcinoma (p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference in the incidence of ER-IR between scirrhous carcinoma and non-scirrhous poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Synchronous expression of ER and epidermal growth factor receptor was found in 8 of the 26 scirrhous carcinomas (30.8%). Patients with ER-IR positive scirrhous gastric carcinomas showed a much worse prognosis than those with ER-IR negative scirrhous carcinomas.","title":"Estrogen receptors in gastric adenocarcinoma: a retrospective immunohistochemical analysis.","pubmedId":"2845639"}
