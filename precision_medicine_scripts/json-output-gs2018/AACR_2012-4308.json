In particular, tumor recurrence after surgical resection, aggressive chemotherapy, and targeted radiation remains an insurmountable obstacle. Recurrence has been attributed to residual cancer cells that re-initiate tumor growth after primary clinical intervention. Here, we provide new evidence that a subpopulation of invasive and chemoresistant cancer cells is maintained by the transcription factor ZEB1 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1). ZEB1 is preferentially expressed in invasive glioblastoma cells, and its knockdown results in a dramatic reduction of tumor invasion as well as increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent Temozolomide (Temodar, TMZ) in vitro and in vivo. We find that ZEB1 indirectly controls expression of the chemoresistance-mediating enzyme MGMT (O-6-Methylguanine DNA Methyltransferase), as well as cell-cell adhesion pathways, thus linking chemoresistance and brain tumor invasion. Moreover, ZEB1 expression in glioblastoma patients correlates with tumor grade and survival. These results indicate that invasive glioblastoma cells are particularly sheltered from current therapeutic approaches, rendering them likely candidates for tumor recurrence. This offers a potential novel model for GBM recurrence, and a potential new therapeutic target.","title":"ZEB1 mediates invasion and chemoresistance of glioblastoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-4308"}
