Methods: Hybrid capture based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed on 8874 (9.6%) mCRC including both colonic adenocarcinomas (7587 cases; 85%) and rectal adenocarcinomas (1287 cases, 15%) Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was calculated from a minimum of 1.2 Mb of sequenced DNA. Results:ERBB2 amplifications or a short variant (SV) alterations or both were found in 433 (4.9%) of the total mCRC. 195 (45%) of the ERBB2 positive mCRC were female and 238 (55%) were male. Median age was 54 years (range 22 to 88 years). The most frequently co-altered genes were SV GA in TP53 (82%), APC (70%), KRAS (26%), SMAD4 (15%) and PIK3CA (13%). Clinically relevant GA significantly under-represented in ERBB2-altered CRC included significantly reduced GA in KRAS at 26% (p \u003d 0.001) and BRAF at 4% (p \u003d 0.003) as well as other kinases at 1% including EGFR, KIT, MET and RET. The frequency of TMB at \u003e 10 mut/Mb (p \u003c 0.0001), but at \u003e 20 mut/Mb mCRC cases demonstrated virtually the same results regardless to ERBB2 status at a frequency of x%. The overall ERBB2 GA frequency at 5.3% in rectal mCRC is slightly higher than that seen in colonic mCRC at 4.9%, (p \u003d 0.36). The frequency of TMB \u003e 10 mut/Mb in ERBB2 WT mCRC is greater in the colonic mCRC than the rectal mCRC (p \u003c 0.0001 for both comparisons). When \u003e 20 mut/Mb is used as the cut-off, the greater frequency of TMB in colonic mCRC versus rectal mCRC remains significant (p \u003c 0.0001). When the ERBB2altered mCRC cases are evaluated, the greater frequency of TMB \u003e 10 mu/Mb in colonic mCRC versus rectal mCRC remains significant (p \u003d 0.009), but the greater frequency in colonic verses rectal mCRC at the \u003e 20 mut/Mb is not significant (p \u003d 0.37). Conclusions: Although lower than observed in breast and upper gastrointestinal carcinomas where anti-HER2 therapies are approved indications, the frequency of ERBB2 GA in CRC at 4.9% is significant. Importantly, nearly half of CRC ERBB2 alterations are SVs, not detectable by routine IHC and FISH testing. However, the success of anti-HER2 therapies shown here and progress in on-going clinical trials indicates that targeting ERBB2 has potential to become an approved advance in precision therapy for mCRC patients.","title":"Targeted therapy for HER2 driven colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_182035-199"}
