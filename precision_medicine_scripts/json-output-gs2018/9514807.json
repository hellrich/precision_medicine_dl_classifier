A case of malignant melanoma metastatic to one ovary, skin of both axillae, and brain occurring 7 years after wide local excision of the primary cutaneous lesion on the patient\u0027s back is described. The patient had total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy, and selective pelvic retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy, followed by whole brain irradiation and chemoimmunotherapy. This case illustrates the clinical variability and unpredictable biologic behavior of malignant melanoma and it is concluded that malignant melanoma metastatic to the ovary should be suspected in any patient who presents with an adnexal mass and has a history of malignant melanoma.","title":"Malignant melanoma metastatic to the ovary.","pubmedId":"9514807"}
