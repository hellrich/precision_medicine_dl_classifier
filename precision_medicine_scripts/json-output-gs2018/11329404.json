More than half of the victims met the criterion for clinically significant pathology on the General Health QUESTIONNAIRE: Stalking often yielded substantial posttraumatic stress symptoms, commensurate with levels found in other studies of traumatized subjects.\nSupport-seeking female stalking victims experience pervasive and persistent threat and intrusion; these experiences lead to high levels of psychological morbidity.","title":"Traumatic distress among support-seeking female victims of stalking.","pubmedId":"11329404"}
