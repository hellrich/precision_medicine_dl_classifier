Among its members, FGFR1 has been related to squamous cell lung carcinoma, where FGFR1 amplification is present in 20% of patients. However, its role in lung cancer has not yet been thoroughly described.Several lung cancer cell lines with different genetic backgrounds were transfected with plasmids to either overexpress or silence FGFR1. Then several tumorigenic abilities were tested in vitro and in vivo. mRNA from Paraffin-embedded tissue of a cohort of lung cancer patients was extracted and FGFR1 expression levels were measured and related to clinical characteristics.FGFR1 increases oncogenic properties in SCC cell lines, but exerts anti-oncogenic effects in several lung ADC cell lines, suggesting a tumor suppressor role under certain circumstances. This is a consequence of differentially expressed genes among these two histologies. According to this, analysis of FGFR1 mRNA expression of a cohort of lung cancer patients revealed that high FGFR1 mRNA expression was associated to a shorter overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in lung SCC patients. However, a trend for longer OS was observed for the ADC patients with higher FGFR1 mRNA expression.FGFR1 has the potential to be either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene and the molecular context is a determining factor to define its final role in tumorigenesis.","title":"FGFR1 can act as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the molecular context","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1122"}
