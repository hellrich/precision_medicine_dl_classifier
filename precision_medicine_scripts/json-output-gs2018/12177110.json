Cancers of the lung (observed [Obs] \u003d 377; O/E \u003d 2.9), digestive tract (Obs \u003d 376; O/E \u003d 1.7), and female breast (Obs \u003d 234; O/E \u003d 2.0) accounted for the largest number of subsequent malignancies. Twenty-five years after HD diagnosis, the actuarial risk of developing a solid tumor was 21.9%. The relative risk of solid neoplasms decreased with increasing age at HD diagnosis, however, patients aged 51 to 60 years at HD diagnosis sustained the highest cancer burden (AER \u003d 79.2/10,000 patients/year). After a progressive rise in relative risk and AER of all solid tumors over time, there was an apparent downturn in risk at 25 years. Temporal trends and treatment group distribution for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, rectum, female breast, bladder, thyroid, and bone/connective tissue were suggestive of a radiogenic effect.\nSignificantly increased risks of second cancers were observed in all HD age groups. Although significantly elevated risks of stomach, female breast, and uterine cervix cancers persisted for 25 years, an apparent decrease in relative risk and AER of solid tumors at other sites is suggested.","title":"Second malignant neoplasms among long-term survivors of Hodgkin\u0027s disease: a population-based evaluation over 25 years.","pubmedId":"12177110"}
