Clinical outcome was compared among different mutation subgroups.\nOf 152 KRAS wt mCRC patients, 148 were evaluable for RAS and BRAF mutation status. Eleven RAS mutations were detected in 10 patients\u0027 tumors (7%). BRAF mutations were detected in 14 patients\u0027 tumors (9%). RAS and BRAF tumor mutations were mutually exclusive. Compared with patients with RAS wt/BRAF wt tumors (n \u003d 124; median overall survival, 28.5 months), those with RAS mutations (n \u003d 10; median, 16.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.89; P \u003d .020) or BRAF mutations (n \u003d 14; median, 11.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.41; P \u003c .0001) had worse overall survival, which remained significant (P \u003c .04) when adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics among the mutation subgroups.\nThese findings support those from recent studies that RAS and BRAF mutations are associated with poor outcome in patients receiving an epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted monoclonal antibody in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Furthermore, mutation testing should not only include RAS codons 12 and 13 but should also be extended to the entire coding regions.","title":"FOLFOX4 Plus Cetuximab for Patients With Previously Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer According to Tumor RAS and BRAF Mutation Status: Updated Analysis of the CECOG/CORE 1.2.002 Study.","pubmedId":"25666295"}
