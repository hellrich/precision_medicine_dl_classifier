Both incidences and deaths associated with melanoma are increasing in Caucasian populations. While exposure to ultraviolet radiation through sun-exposure is the major risk factor; the host factors including skin type and number of moles are critical in predisposition. The CDKN2A is a high penetrance melanoma susceptibility gene as carriers of the mutations are predisposed to the disease within familial settings. The gene is also somatically altered to varying degrees in sporadic melanoma. The CDK4 gene due to occurrence of activation mutations in a few families worldwide represents another melanoma susceptibility locus. The variants within the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) gene, which encodes a melanocyte specific surface receptor with a key role in pigmentation, are associated with high risk phenotypes and increased risk of melanoma. Melanoma tumors are characterized by activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway through either autocrine growth factor stimulation or oncogenic mutations in the B-RAF or N-RAS genes. Somatic mutations in the B-RAF gene are complemented by those in the N-RAS gene and represent the major genetic alterations. The mutations in the B-RAF gene in melanoma due to occurrence in melanocytic nevi represent early events that additionally require loss of cell cycle inhibitors like CDKN2A for melanoma progression and development. The sequence of events points to the cooperative collaboration between different genetic pathways in tumor development that can be and are being used as targets for developing specific therapeutic agents.","title":"Malignant melanoma--a genetic overview.","pubmedId":"20096196"}
