Mutations in the kinase domain of the EGFR gene provide sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) drugs. TKI show initial response rates over 75% in mutant EGFR-NSCLC patients, although most of these patients acquire resistance to EGFR inhibitors after therapy. EGFR-TKI resistance mechanisms include amplification in MET and its ligand, and also MET mutations. MET signaling dysregulation has been involved in tumor cell growth, survival, migration and invasion, angiogenesis and activation of several pathways, therefore representing an attractive target for anticancer drug development. In this review, we will discuss MET-related mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC, as well as the main drugs targeted to inhibit MET pathway.
