Incision biopsy revealed a nodular malignant melanoma and the toe was amputated. There is no sign of recurrence at 18 month follow-up. As prognosis is related to local disease extent, any persistent nail bed lesion should be biopsied to exclude the possibility of malignant melanoma.","title":"Subungual amelanotic melanoma: a diagnostic pitfall.","pubmedId":"2362886"}
