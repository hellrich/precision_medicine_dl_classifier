Surface expression of flt3 receptor and flt3 ligand were detected by flow cytometry using biotinylated human flt3 ligand or biotinylated soluble human flt3 receptor Fc fusion protein (flt3R-Fc), respectively. Flt3 receptor and ligand expression were also examined by Northern blot analysis. Flt3 receptor was expressed on the surface of only two of nine murine cell lines and nine of 15 human cell lines, with positive cells representing the B cell, early myeloid, and monocytic lineages. Staining for surface expression of the flt3 ligand revealed that seven of nine murine cell lines and nine of 15 human cell lines screened were positive by flow cytometry. All murine and human cell lines assayed were positive for flt3 ligand RNA expression by Northern blot analysis, but not all cell lines expressing flt3 ligand mRNA had detectable surface expression. Cells expressing the flt3 ligand were of the myeloid, B cell and T cell lineages at various stages of differentiation. Only the OCI-AML-5, NALM-6, and AML-193 cell lines coexpressed both surface flt3 receptor and ligand. The myeloid leukemic M1 cell terminally differentiate into macrophage-like cells under the influence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). We found that LIF-stimulated M1 cells down-regulated surface expression and mRNA levels of the flt3 receptor, but up-regulated expression of the flt3 ligand. Although we could demonstrate that the flt3 receptor was functional in the M1 cell line, flt3 ligand could not induce the M1 cells to differentiate.","title":"Expression of the flt3 receptor and its ligand on hematopoietic cells.","pubmedId":"7630197"}
