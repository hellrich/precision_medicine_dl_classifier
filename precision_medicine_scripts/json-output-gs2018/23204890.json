A case of recurrent malignant melanoma with in-transit metastasis treated with short-course, high-fraction palliative radiation is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of radiotherapy.\nAn 80-year-old woman initially treated surgically for a primary malignant melanoma of the left lower leg presented with multiple in-transit metastases. Palliative radiation was offered to treat two fungating in-transit masses that were resistant to treatments of isolated limb infusion and intralesional interleukin-2.\nTreatment consisted of short-course, high-fraction radiation with 800 cGy fractions given over three weeks on days 0, 7 and 21, for a total dose of 2400 cGy. She experienced a complete response that was maintained for six months.\nRadiation is an effective treatment option for palliation of recurrent malignant melanoma. Complete response is possible even with short-course, high-fraction radiation.","title":"Is radiotherapy an effective treatment option for recurrent metastatic malignant melanoma?
