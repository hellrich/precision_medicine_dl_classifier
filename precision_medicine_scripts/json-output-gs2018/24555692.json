He underwent a total thyroidectomy. His thyroid function was normal. Ultrasonography showed a heterogeneous thyroid nodule measuring 3.7cm to the right from midline and 3.3cm to the left from midline that was associated with two nodules in the left submandibular area measuring 1.43cm and 1.52cm.Fine needle aspiration confirmed the benign nature of the gland and thyroid tissue etiology of the two submandibular nodules, located in level II of the neck. Since the ectopic thyroid tissue in his lateral neck was suggestive of metastasis of occult primary thyroid carcinoma, the patient underwent a total thyroidectomy plus a left modified radical neck dissection with preservation of level I. The diagnosis of multinodular goiter associated with two parasitic thyroid nodules was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.\nWe conclude that the parasitic thyroid nodule should be included in the differential diagnosis of lateral neck masses. The diagnosis and differentiation of these nodules from metastatic adenopathies of differentiated thyroid carcinoma has important therapeutic and prognostic implications, and can lead to avoidance of unnecessary surgeries.","title":"Parasitic thyroid nodules in patient with nontoxic multinodular goiter: a case report.","pubmedId":"24555692"}
