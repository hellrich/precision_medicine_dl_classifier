The first case was a 70-year-old male who had bladder cancer, occult cancer of prostate (adenocarcinoma) and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of pancreas. He died of cachexy. The second case was a 69-year-old male. This case was also triple primary neoplasm including bladder cancer, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of penis and SCC of larynx. The third case was a 78-year-old male who had bladder cancer, adenocarcinoma of prostate similar to that of the first case, adenocarcinoma of stomach, and SCC of lung. He died of obstructive jaundice and renal failure owing to massive metastases of gastric cancer. The fourth case was a 78-year-old male who had four primary neoplasms such as bladder cancer, branchiogenic epithelial carcinoma, SCC of buccal mucosa and adenocarcinoma of rectum.","title":"[Two cases of triple primary neoplasm and two cases of quadruple primary neoplasm including bladder cancer].","pubmedId":"4091130"}
