Monoclonal antibodies detecting six antigenic systems on melanoma cell surfaces were tested for blocking activity on the effector function of subcultured cytolytic T lymphocytes for autologous melanoma cells. The monoclonal antibodies R24 (gamma 3), specific for the GD3 disialoganglioside on melanoma cell surfaces and I24 (gamma M), detecting a similar antigenic determinant, blocked autologous T lymphocytotoxicity for malignant melanoma cells on the target level. The effector function of alloantigen activated cytolytic T lymphocytes generated by coculture of allogeneic PBL with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed AV B lymphocytes, was blocked by monoclonal antibody R24 when tested against AV melanoma targets, but not when tested against AV B lymphocyte targets. It is concluded that blocking by mAb R24 occurs in this system as a nonspecific effect, unrelated to the specific target antigen recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Steric hindrance or antibody induced membrane changes may account for the blocking effect of monoclonal antibody R24.","title":"Target level blocking of T-cell cytotoxicity for human malignant melanoma by monoclonal antibodies.","pubmedId":"6198103"}
