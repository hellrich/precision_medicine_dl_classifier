Although extrathyroidal extension to the soft tissues of the neck may occur, distant metastases are rare in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Skeletal muscle metastasis from a differentiated thyroid carcinoma seems to be extremely rare, even for the follicular type of this cancer, well known for its hematogenous spread to various sites.","title":"Distant solitary skeletal muscle metastasis from papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"18050833"}
