ICP delivers unbiased, high-level enrichment of gene regions enabling determination of point mutations and insertions/deletions using Sanger sequencing, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).This is especially important when sample DNA, e.g. from circulating free DNA, exosomes and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), is insufficient for multiplexed analysis.A critical limitation of mutational analysis of such samples is the need for increasing amounts of DNA for detecting very low-level mutations. A range of 100 to330 ng of substrate DNA is usually needed for reliable detection of alterations present at 0.01% in the sample DNA; this is not feasible with the limited quantities of blood/plasma/serum from clinical trials. ICP\u0027s ability to enrich alterations can provide a 100-fold increase in Sanger, NGS and ddPCR sensitivity.Materials and Methods: To increase throughput, address the limiting amounts of DNA present in these samples and provide enriched amplification from many different gene regions in a single DNA sample, a multiplex ICP approach has been developed (MX-ICP). This MX-ICP method provides enrichment of any alteration present in all targeted genes from a single sample of DNA. When MX-ICP products are analyzed by Sanger, NGS or ddPCR, lower quantities of sample DNA can be used for detection of mutations at 0.01%.We compared detection of low-level of mutations in limiting amounts of DNA, with or without the use of MX-ICP prior to NGS and ddPCR, using digitally verified chromosomal DNA mixtures from Horizon Diagnostics. The alterations analyzed were from (1) CTC and NSCLC patients plasma, (2) longitudinal sampling of melanoma patients and (3) CTCs isolated from NSCLC patients. In all cases, use of MX-ICP, prior to analysis using NGS or ddPCR, enabled very sensitive detection with low amounts of input DNA.Conclusion: MX-ICP is a key component of procedures for sensitive detection and monitoring of genetic alterations in multiple targets using a single DNA sample. Coupling MX-ICP with platforms such as NGS and ddPCR enables the use of these powerful technologies for high sensitivity detection and monitoring of liquid biopsies from cancer patients. The combination of MX-ICP with NGS and ddPCR platforms means that they can be used efficiently for detection of alterations at0.01% in samples with \u003c100 ng DNA. This enables monitoring and detection of alterations in the low volumes of liquid biopsies obtained from patients and clinical trials.","title":"Multiplexed ICE COLD-PCR coupled to NGS and ddPCR enables enhanced detection of low-level DNA mutations in tissues and liquid biopsies","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-5438"}
