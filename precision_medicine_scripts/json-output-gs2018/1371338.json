In this report we asked whether the c-kit gene product is also involved in promoting the growth of transformed melanocytes. We found that, while c-Kit protein was readily observed in normal human neonatal and adult melanocytes, the majority of cell lines established from human melanoma samples did not express detectable levels of c-kit mRNA or protein. A similar pattern of differential expression was also observed in normal and transformed murine melanocytes. Our findings raise the possibility that a marked reduction in c-kit gene expression either promotes or is a consequence of transformation in melanocytes.","title":"Loss of c-kit expression in cultured melanoma cells.","pubmedId":"1371338"}
