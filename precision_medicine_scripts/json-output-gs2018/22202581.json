CTCs were assessed to determine prognostic utility in follow-up of disease-free stage IV patients pre- and during treatment.\nAfter complete metastasectomy, patients were prospectively enrolled in a randomized trial of adjuvant therapy with a whole-cell melanoma vaccine, Canvaxin, plus Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) versus placebo plus BCG. Blood specimens obtained pretreatment (n \u003d 244) and during treatment (n \u003d 214) were evaluated by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for expression of MART-1, MAGE-A3, and PAX3 mRNA biomarkers. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses examined CTC biomarker expression with respect to clinicopathological variables.\nCTC biomarker(s) (â‰¥ 1) was detected in 54% of patients pretreatment and in 86% of patients over the first 3 months. With a median follow-up of 21.9 months, 71% of patients recurred and 48% expired. CTC levels were not associated with known prognostic factors or treatment arm. In multivariate analysis, pretreatment CTC (\u003e 0 vs. 0 biomarker) status was significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS; HR 1.64, P \u003d 0.002) and overall survival (OS; HR 1.53, P \u003d 0.028). Serial CTC (\u003e0 vs. 0 biomarker) status was also significantly associated with DFS (HR 1.91, P \u003d 0.02) and OS (HR 2.57, P \u003d 0.012).\nCTC assessment can provide prognostic discrimination before and during adjuvant treatment for resected stage IV melanoma patients.","title":"Assessment of prognostic circulating tumor cells in a phase III trial of adjuvant immunotherapy after complete resection of stage IV melanoma.","pubmedId":"22202581"}
