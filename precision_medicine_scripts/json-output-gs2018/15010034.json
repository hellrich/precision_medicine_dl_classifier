There was a statistically significant decrease in BMD between DMPA users and controls at 6 months (-3.02% change, P\u003d0.014) 12 months (-3.38% change, P\u003d0.001) 18 months (-4.81% change, P\u003c0.001) and 24 months (-6.81% change, P\u003d0.010). There was no statistical difference between pill users and controls.\nThere is a relationship between DMPA use and a decrease in BMD compared to normal menstruating controls that seems to persist up to 24 months.","title":"Bone mineral density in adolescent females using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate.","pubmedId":"15010034"}
