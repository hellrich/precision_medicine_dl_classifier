The regulation of the RU/RR dichotomy remains to be elusive. Our bioinformatics analysis of the SRR2 sequence suggests that cMyc may be an important factor. In support of this concept, we found a substantially higher expression of cMyc and more cMyc and Sox2-SRR2 probe bindings in RR cells than in RU cells. Inhibition of cMyc in RR cells significantly decreased SRR2 luciferase activity, and overexpression of cMyc in RU cells significantly increased SRR2 luciferase activity. Correlating with this, cMyc inhibition in RR cells significantly attenuated the clonogenicity and sensitized cells to doxorubicin; while overexpression of cMyc in RU cells conferred to the potentiated clonogenicity and chemoresistance. Importantly, we found cMyc not only maintains Sox2 protein expression, but also promotes Sox2 SRR2 probe binding and its transcriptional activity. Moreover, we found the highly active Wnt canonical pathway (WCP) contributes to the high expression of cMyc in RR cells. Intriguingly, we observed a positive regulatory loop in RR cells, in which Sox2 up-regulates Wnt2B, which can activate the WCP and cMyc. Furthermore, the significance of cMyc in this context was further highlighted by the fact that RU cells with stably transfected c-MYC are phenotypically similar with RR cells in terms of the elevated activation of WCP and increased tumorigenicity in vivo. Lastly, we found cMyc is heterogeneously expressed in ALK+ALCL tumor cells (n \u003d 5) by immunohistochemcial staining, and it co-localizes with active -catenin, a marker of active WCP, in tumor cells by immunofluorescence assay. In conclusion, cMyc is a key regulatory factor in the determination of RU/RR dichotomy, which is linked to tumorigenic potential and chemo-resistance in ALK+ALCL.","title":"The high cMyc expression characterizes a small cell subpopulation in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma that carry cancer stem-like properties","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3335"}
