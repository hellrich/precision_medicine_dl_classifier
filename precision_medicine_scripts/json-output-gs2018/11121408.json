Leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) protein is a widely expressed receptor-type protein-tyrosine-phosphatase that is implicated in the regulation of intracellular signaling triggered by both cell adhesion and peptide growth factors. The gene for LAR is localized to human chromosome 1p32, a region frequently deleted in tumors of neuroectodermal origin, including neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and medullary thyroid carcinoma. On the other hand, the RET gene codes for a transmembrane tyrosine kinase and is responsible for the development of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and 2B. To explore the potential role of LAR in RET tyrosine kinase activity and RET-induced signal transduction, we cotransfected LAR and RET with a MEN2A or MEN2B mutation (designated RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B) into the NIH 3T3 cell line. Here we show that LAR reduces the constitutive tyrosine autophosphorylation and kinase activity of RET-MEN2A but not RET-MEN2B, accompanying a significant decrease of phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma, AKT, and ERK1/2. Interestingly, LAR expression significantly decreased the levels of disulfide-linked RET-MEN2A dimerization. Moreover, reduced oncogenic activity of RET-MEN2A by overexpression of LAR was observed both by an in vitro colony formation assay and by in vivo tumorigenicity in scid mice. These results thus suggest that LAR may contribute to deactivation of the RET-MEN2A mutant protein and reduction of its oncogenic activity in vivo.","title":"Differential effects of leukocyte common antigen-related protein on biochemical and biological activities of RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B mutant proteins.","pubmedId":"11121408"}
