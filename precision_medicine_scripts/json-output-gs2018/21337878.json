This analysis of data from a prospective, randomized trial included patients with cutaneous melanoma \u003e or \u003d 1.0 mm Breslow thickness who underwent wide local excision and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors associated with TIL response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). A total of 515 patients were included; TIL response was classified as \"brisk\" (n \u003d 100; 19.4%) or \"non-brisk\" (n \u003d 415; 80.6%). Patients in the nonbrisk TIL group were more likely to have tumor-positive SLN (17.6% vs 7%; P \u003d 0.0087). On multivariate analysis, nonbrisk TIL response, increased tumor thickness, and ulceration were significant independent predictors of tumor-positive SLN. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, 5-year DFS rate was 91 per cent for those with a brisk TIL response compared with 86 per cent in the nonbrisk group (P \u003d 0.41). The 5-year OS rates were 95 per cent versus 84 per cent in the brisk versus nonbrisk TIL groups, respectively (P \u003d 0.0083). However, on multivariate analysis, TIL response was not a significant independent factor predicting DFS or OS. TIL response is a significant predictor of SLN metastasis but is not a major predictor of DFS or OS.","title":"Prognostic significance of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma.","pubmedId":"21337878"}
