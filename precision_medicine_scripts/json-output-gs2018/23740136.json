The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the prognostic impact of the expression of c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition (c-Met) a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in expression growth, survival, motility/migration, and invasion in GMB patients managed according to the established diagnostic and therapeutic protocols.\nBetween May 2003 and March 2011, a total of 69 patients (33 males and 36 females; mean age: 52.2 ± 12.9 years, age range: 23-81 years) referred to our Department for the surgical removal of GBM were evaluated immunohistochemically for c-Met expression. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) served as the main outcome measures.\nCompared with c-Met- subjects (n \u003d 38), c-Met+ subjects (n \u003d 31) had both a significantly lower OS (15.3 ± 2.3 vs. 22.6 ± 2.5 months, respectively, p \u003c 0.01) and PFS (12.3 ± 2.1 vs. 19.1 ± 2.6 months, respectively, p \u003c 0.05). After allowance for potential confounders, multivariate Cox regression analysis identified c-Met+ as an independent predictor of both OS (hazard ratio \u003d 1.7; 95 % confidence interval \u003d 1.2-1.9, p \u003c 0.01) and PFS (hazard ratio \u003d 1.6; 95 % confidence interval \u003d 1.1-2.3, p \u003c 0.05).\nOur findings suggest that c-Met immunohistochemical expression is an independent predictor of outcomes in patients with GBM treated by standard of care.","title":"The immunohistochemical expression of c-Met is an independent predictor of survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.","pubmedId":"23740136"}
