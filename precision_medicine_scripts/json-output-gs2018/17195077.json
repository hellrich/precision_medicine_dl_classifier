Expression of PD-L1 on tumors strongly correlates with the survival of cancer patients. PD-L1 on tumors interacts with the co-inhibitory molecule Programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1, CD279) on T cells mediating decreased TCR-mediated proliferation and cytokine production. In animal tumor models, blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 interactions resulted in an improved tumor control. In addition, exhausted T cells during chronic viral infections could be revived by PD-L1 blockade. Thus, targeting PD-L1/PD-1 interactions might improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapies (ACT) of chronic infections as well as cancers. Obstacles for a general blockade of PD-L1 might be its role in mediating peripheral tolerance. This review discusses the currently available data concerning the role of PD-L1 in tumor immune evasion and envisions possibilities for implementation into ACT for cancer patients.","title":"Contribution of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway to T-cell exhaustion: an update on implications for chronic infections and tumor evasion.","pubmedId":"17195077"}
