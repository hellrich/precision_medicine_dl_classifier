CD34(+) /CD38(-) cells expressed a greater amount of p-janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) than CD34(+) /CD38(+) counterparts in all patients except for one case. In addition, we found that CD34(+) /CD38(-) cells were relatively resistant to cytarabine- and the inhibitor of the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-mediated growth inhibition, as measured by the clonogenic assay. Interestingly, blockade of JAK2/STAT5 signaling by the specific JAK2 inhibitor AZ960 stimulated cell cycling in CD34(+) /CD38(-) cells in conjunction with downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(waf1) and sensitized these cells to the growth inhibition mediated by cytarabine and the FLT3 kinase inhibitor. Moreover, exposure of CD34(+) /CD38(-) cells to AZ960 potently induced apoptosis in parallel with downregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, as measured by Western blot analysis. Taken together, JAK2/STAT5 signaling may be a promising molecular target to eradicate CD34(+) /CD38(-) leukemia cells in individuals with AML.","title":"Inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 by the inhibitor of janus kinases stimulates dormant human leukemia CD34+ /CD38- cells and sensitizes them to antileukemia agents.","pubmedId":"21128225"}
