It was discovered by Agensys using suppressive subtractive hybridization on biopsies from bladder cancer patients. Expression in bladder cancer was confirmed by RNA and immunohistochemical analysis. These studies showed SLITRK6 to be highly expressed in bladder carcinoma in situ as well as in invasive and metastatic bladder cancer. In addition, SLITRK6 was shown to be expressed in a subset of lung cancer, breast cancer and glioblastoma specimens.Agensys has generated a novel antibody drug conjugate (ADC), targeting SLITRK6, which is being developed for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer. This Monomethyl Auristatin E based ADC binds to cell surface SLITRK6 with high affinity and cross reacts with the cynomolgus monkey orthologue. Selection and development of this ADC will be discussed including antibody choice, drug platform choice, conjugation development and other aspects of pre-clinical evaluation.","title":"Development of AGS15E, a novel antibody drug conjugate targeting SLITRK6 for the treatment of bladder cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-4332"}
