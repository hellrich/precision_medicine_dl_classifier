In a multivariate logistic regression analysis,factors associated with VTM were the nodular and acrolentiginous types; the head and neck and lower limb locations; older age; male sex; and being single, separated,divorced, or widowed. When only factors related to patients were taken into account, older age, male sex,and living alone were independent risk factors for VTM.The most significant risk was observed for patients living alone.\nIntrinsic factors related to the tumor and socio demographic characteristics of patients contribute to the occurrence of VTM. These factors should be better targeted in future secondary prevention programs.","title":"Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics associated with thick melanomas.
