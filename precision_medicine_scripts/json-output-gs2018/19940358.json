In addition, the expression of the netrin receptor UNC5B was induced and that of UNC5C was reduced in the tumor cells. In order to determine the functional relevance of Netrin-1 expression in malignant melanoma, Netrin expression in melanoma cells was reduced by siRNA attempts and primary human melanocytes were treated with recombinant Netrin-1. The cells showed no changes in proliferation or apoptosis, however, a strong reduction of migratory properties was observed in the melanoma cells after reduction of Netrin expression whereas melanocyte migration was strongly induced by treatment with Netrin.\nOur study suggests that Netrin-1 promotes melanoma cell invasion and migration and therefore has an important role in the progression of malignant melanoma.","title":"Functional implication of Netrin expression in malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"19940358"}
