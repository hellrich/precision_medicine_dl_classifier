Understanding the molecular mechanisms affecting cancer cell sensitivity or resistance to EGFR inhibitors may be of help in deciding on treatment and in new translational studies. This review will focus on the most relevant mechanisms contributing to the acquisition of sensitivity/resistance to EGFR inhibitors.","title":"Resistance mechanisms of tumour cells to EGFR inhibitors.","pubmedId":"19451059"}
