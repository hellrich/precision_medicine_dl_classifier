The identification of new molecular markers may serve for the estimation of prognosis and thus augment treatment decisions and affect therapy outcome. The aim of this study was to describe the morphological characteristics and the DNA methylation status of the CDKN2A,CDH1, ATM, FHIT and RAR- genes in the central and peripheral part of the tumor and the surgical margin and evaluate their prognostic significance. 53 patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer were enrolled to the prospective study, and had been primarily treated surgically. Correlations between morphological data, hypermethylation status and clinicopathological data, as well as prognosis, were assessed. Nuclei polymorphism highly correlated with T stage (p \u003c 0.0001), N stage (p \u003c 0.046), and metastases to the lymph nodes pN (p \u003c 0.004 ). Also, the number of cells in irregular mitosis correlated with T stage (p \u003c 0.004), and highly with pN (p \u003c 0.009). The significance of CDKN2A hypermethylation as a good prognostic factor was also established in the Kaplan-Meir test. The ultrastructural analysis showed that none of the examined tumors had homogenous texture and that resection margin specimens clean in HE stained tissue samples frequently contained single tumor cells or few cells in groups surrounded by connective tissue. This indicates the superiority of electron microscopy over standard histopathological analysis. Thus, a combination of such morphological examination with epigenetic parameters described herein could result in the discovery of promising new prognostic markers of the disease.","title":"Prognostic factors in oral and oropharyngeal cancer based on ultrastructural analysis and DNA methylation of the tumor and surgical margin.","pubmedId":"24782031"}
