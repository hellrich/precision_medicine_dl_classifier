The present study was aimed to investigate the expression status of miR-124-1 and its clinical relevance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nReal-time quantitative PCR was performed to detect the expression level of miR-124-1 in AML patients. The clinical significance of miR-124-1 expression in AML was investigated.\nmiR-124-1 underexpression was identified in 30 (36%) of 83 AML patients. No significant difference could be observed in sex, age and blood parameters between the patients with and without miR-124-1 underexpression. The frequency of miR-124-1 underexpression was higher in the patients with t(15;17) than in others (62% versus 30%, P \u003d 0.040). The status of miR-124-1 expression was not correlated with the mutations of nine genes (FLT3-ITD, NPM1, C-KIT, IDH1/IDH2, DNMT3A, N/K-RAS and C/EBPA). The patients with miR-124-1 underexpression had borderline longer overall survival and relapse-free survival than those without miR-124-1 underexpression (P \u003d 0.052 and 0.045, respectively).\nThese findings suggest that miR-124-1 underexpression is a common event and might have a favorable impact on prognosis in AML.","title":"Dysregulation of miR-124-1 predicts favorable prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"24135052"}
