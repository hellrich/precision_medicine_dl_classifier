In three cases these cells represent an unexpectedly high proportion of the lymphocytic infiltrate, ranging from 15 to 25%. This elevated percentage is maintained when tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are propagated in vitro for 2 or 3 weeks in the presence of recombinant interleukin 2 and autologous tumor cells. Functional studies reveal that gamma delta lines or clones developed from lymphocytes infiltrating primary melanoma display, in addition to their natural killer-like activity, a potent autologous tumor cell cytotoxic activity that does not seem to be restricted by major histocompatibility complex gene products.","title":"TCR gamma delta bearing T lymphocytes infiltrating human primary cutaneous melanomas.","pubmedId":"1532004"}
