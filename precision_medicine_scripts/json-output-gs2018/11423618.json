Through biochemical and molecular analysis of clinical material, we find that drug resistance is associated with the reactivation of BCR-ABL signal transduction in all cases examined. In six of nine patients, resistance was associated with a single amino acid substitution in a threonine residue of the Abl kinase domain known to form a critical hydrogen bond with the drug. This substitution of threonine with isoleucine was sufficient to confer STI-571 resistance in a reconstitution experiment. In three patients, resistance was associated with progressive BCR-ABL gene amplification. These studies provide evidence that genetically complex cancers retain dependence on an initial oncogenic event and suggest a strategy for identifying inhibitors of STI-571 resistance.","title":"Clinical resistance to STI-571 cancer therapy caused by BCR-ABL gene mutation or amplification.","pubmedId":"11423618"}
