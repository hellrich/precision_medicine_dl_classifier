It may present with symptoms of dysphagia, upper airway obstruction, or even hemorrhage anytime from infancy through adulthood. Treatment of this disorder includes the use of exogenous thyroid hormone to correct the hypothyroidism and to induce shrinkage of the gland. When symptoms of obstruction or bleeding appear, ablative therapy by means of surgery or radioiodine is warranted. We report our experience with lingual thyroid gland and discuss elements of the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation, with emphasis on the clinical findings, laboratory tests, and radiographic imaging studies.","title":"Lingual thyroid.","pubmedId":"19517389"}
