During the period from 2000 to 2006, 16760 cases of skin melanoma have been diagnosed, and in 873 patients from them PMMT has been registered. So, the part of the patients with multiple tumors among all patients with skin melanoma was 5.2%. Most often PMMT appears in the case of skin melanoma of head and neck (6.6 +/- 0.4%). Most commonly skin melanoma is accompanied by other skin malignant neoplasms (40.9 +/- 1.6% of all PMMT cases). Upon malignant skin melanoma, PMMT occurs more often in males (5.7 +/- 0.7%) than in females (4.9 +/- 0.7%). Most often the diagnosis of skin melanoma at PMMT is detected synchronously (48.3 +/- 1.6%), and simultaneous detection of PMMT predominates in all polyneoplasms and in all age groups. The most favourable course of skin melanoma is characteristic for metachronous cancer of II type when melanoma is diagnosed after manifestation of other malignant tumor.","title":"[Primary multiple malignant neoplasms in patients with skin melanoma].","pubmedId":"19145823"}
