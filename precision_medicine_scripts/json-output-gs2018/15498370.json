The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of plasma DNA quantification in discriminating lung cancer from the healthy and benign lung disease.\nPlasma DNA was extracted with a QIAamp DNA Blood Midi kit and quantified by a PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation kit in 44 healthy individuals, 36 benign lung disease patients and 67 lung cancer patients. Discrimination power was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve.\nPlasma DNA values were significantly increased in lung cancer patients, especially in those with metastases, and in benign lung disease patients compared with that in the healthy individuals (P \u003c 0.001, respectively). The values in lung cancer patients were significantly increased compared with that in the benign lung disease patients (P \u003c 0.001). The area under the curve was 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 - 0.99] for the healthy versus lung cancer, 0.73 (95% CI 0.64 - 0.83) for lung cancer versus benign lung disease, and 0.86 (95% CI 0.80 - 0.91) for lung cancer versus the healthy and benign lung disease.\nPlasma DNA quantification has a strong power to discriminate lung cancer from the healthy and from the healthy and benign lung disease, less power to discriminate lung cancer from benign lung disease. Plasma DNA quantification may be useful as a screening tool for lung cancer.","title":"Quantification of plasma DNA as a screening tool for lung cancer.","pubmedId":"15498370"}
