Tumor initiating cells (TICs) are capable of self-renewal and comprise a subset of the tumor mass. These cells are proposed to drive the growth and metastasis of tumors, and are considered to be resistant to traditional cytotoxic and targeted therapies. Several studies have shown that NF-κB signaling is increased in recurrent prostate cancer and enriched in prostate TICs. We sought to determine the potential of an IKK/NF-κB-driven mechanism for inherent or acquired resistance by IKK-mediated control of a subset of prostate tumor initiating cells. These studies were performed by using established prostate cancer cell lines, murine prostate organoids, and a murine prostate cancer animal model. We have found that inhibition of IKKα and IKKβ, upstream regulators of noncanonical and canonical NF-κB signaling, block self-renewal of several PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we have also found that IKK is important for tumorigenicity and stemness seen in prostate cancer cells as measured by colony formation and extreme limiting dilution assays. Loss of canonical NF-κB (p65/RelA) decreased stemness while loss of noncanonical did not alter tumorsphere formation. Interestingly, Pten-/- tumors with loss of Ikkα or Ikkβ displayed decreased levels of self-renewing cells as measured by CD49fhigh expression, a known prostate basal cell marker. Isolated murine Pten-/- cells were 2x more efficient than Pten-/-Ikkα-/- or Pten-/-Ikkβ-/- cells in forming prostate organoids suggesting that loss of Ikk decreased the number of self-renewing cells needed for formation. Taken together, we conclude that IKK-mediated signaling is important for maintenance of prostate tumor initiating cells and further studies will address whether IKK-mediated signaling provides a mechanism for evading current therapies.","title":"IKK-mediated signaling controls prostate tumor initiating cells.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-2877"}
