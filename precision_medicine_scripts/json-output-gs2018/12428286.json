Epithalon markedly inhibited neoplasm development: the maximum size of breast adenocarcinomas was 33% lower than in the control (p \u003c 0.05). The intensity of HER-2/neu mRNA expression in breast tumors of Epithalon-treated mice was 3.7 times lower than in control animals. These results indicate that Epithalon inhibits breast tumor development in transgenic mice, which is probably related to suppression of HER-2/neu expression.","title":"Epithalon inhibits tumor growth and expression of HER-2/neu oncogene in breast tumors in transgenic mice characterized by accelerated aging.","pubmedId":"12428286"}
