Multivariate analysis performed did not show a significant difference in survival between c-Kit-positive and c-Kit-negative groups (P \u003d 0.36) and VEGF-positive and VEGF-negative groups (P \u003d 0.25). Interestingly, c-Kit was more likely to be overexpressed in the superficial spreading type and VEGF was overexpressed preferentially in the amelanotic melanoma type.\nHER-2/neu has no role in melanogenesis. Both c-Kit (expressed in superficial spreading disease) and VEGF (expressed in amelanotic melanoma) may have significant therapeutic implications as molecular targets, which warrants further investigation.","title":"Immunohistochemical determination of HER-2/neu, c-Kit (CD117), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) overexpression in malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"14634801"}
