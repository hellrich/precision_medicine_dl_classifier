MMP-23 may also alter T cell activity and phenotype through cleavage of proteins affecting cytokine and chemokine signaling. We therefore tested the hypothesis that MMP-23 can negatively regulate the anti-tumor T cell response in human melanoma.\nWe characterized MMP-23 expression in primary melanoma patients who received adjuvant immunotherapy. We examined the association of MMP-23 with the anti-tumor immune response - as assessed by the prevalence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Further, we examined the association between MMP-23 expression and response to immunotherapy. Considering also an in trans mechanism, we examined the association of melanoma MMP-23 and melanoma Kv1.3 expression.\nOur data revealed an inverse association between primary melanoma MMP-23 expression and the anti-tumor T cell response, as demonstrated by decreased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (P \u003d 0.05), in particular brisk TILs (P \u003d 0.04), and a trend towards an increased proportion of immunosuppressive Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (P \u003d 0.07). High melanoma MMP-23 expression is also associated with recurrence in patients treated with immune biologics (P \u003d 0.037) but not in those treated with vaccines (P \u003d 0.64). Further, high melanoma MMP-23 expression is associated with shorter periods of progression-free survival for patients receiving immune biologics (P \u003d 0.025). On the other hand, there is no relationship between melanoma MMP-23 and melanoma Kv1.3 expression (P \u003d 0.27).\nOur data support a role for MMP-23 as a potential immunosuppressive target in melanoma, as well as a possible biomarker for informing melanoma immunotherapies.","title":"Melanoma expression of matrix metalloproteinase-23 is associated with blunted tumor immunity and poor responses to immunotherapy.","pubmedId":"25491880"}
