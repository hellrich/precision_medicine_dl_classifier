Using temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) in a mutation analysis of exon 31 of the NF1 gene we detected the previously reported nonsense mutation R1947X. This C-to-T transition at codon 1947 in exon 31 is considered to represent a mutation \"hot spot\" of the NF1 gene due to 5mCpG deamination. All living family members together with their genomic DNA were included in this investigation. However, the mutation R1947X was absent from two undoubtedly affected siblings of the propositus. Another NF1 mutation (889-2A--\u003eG) was identified in the two sibs by the protein truncation test (PTT). The novel splice site mutation 889-2A--\u003eG results in a skip of NF1 exon 7 during splicing and protein truncation due to frameshift. The two NF1 alterations are linked to different paternal haplotypes. In our study of a three-generation kindred, R1947X represents a de novo mutation whereas 889-2A--\u003eG is an inherited splice mutation. Implications for phenotype variation are discussed.","title":"Two independent mutations in a family with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).","pubmedId":"10076878"}
