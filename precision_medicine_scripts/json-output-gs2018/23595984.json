Distant metastases are more common among this variant and affect survival. Little is known about the molecular pattern of this histotype.\nThis is a report of 2 cases of unusual metastases from TCV, BRAF V600E-positive.\nA 38-year-old woman developed subcutaneous metastases during short-term follow-up; at medium-term follow-up, the patient showed detectable stimulated serum thyroglobulin without disease evidence at imaging. A 33-year-old man presented incidental thymic metastases at time of surgical treatment; this is the first case of not ectopic thymic metastases from PTC.\nTCV may present with unusual metastases already during early follow-up. The more aggressive behavior could be linked to the higher prevalence of BRAF point mutations, but only a long-term follow-up might clarify if this association could worsen the prognosis. Moreover, skin metastases have been predictive factors of worse outcome in our patients, but not thymic metastases.","title":"Unusual metastases from tall cell variant of papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"23595984"}
