The intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm component had the features typical of this entity, with stratified layers of oncocytic cuboidal tumor cells growing in papillary and pseudopapillary arrangements within dilated pancreatic ducts. The invasive carcinoma formed a discrete fleshy tumor with well-circumscribed borders. The invasive carcinoma grew in solid lobules, subdivided by fine fibrovascular septae into predominantly organoid and trabecular growth patterns. Molecular analysis showed no loss of heterozygosity for microsatellite markers at the tumor suppressor loci of TP53, CDKN2A (p16/INK4A), and MADH4 (Smad4/DPC4) in the invasive carcinoma, although loss of heterozygosity was detected at one CDKN2A marker in the intraductal component. DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplification products of exons 1 and 2 of the CDKN2A gene showed no mutation in either tumor component. TP53 immunohistochemistry showed no increased levels of staining, consistent with the presence of wild-type gene product. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing showed no mutation of codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS proto-oncogene. These results suggest that intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm is a neoplasm with genetic changes that are distinct from typical pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The lack of mutation in these genes may be an explanation for the typically indolent clinical behavior of intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasms.","title":"Genetic analysis of invasive carcinoma arising in intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"12170096"}
