The expression of RAS, BRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 was associated with the tumor size, the lymph node metastasis, and the clinical stage of papillary thyroid cancer(P\u003c0.05 or P\u003c0.01).\nThe expression of RAS, BRAF, pMEK1/2, and pERK1/2 is associated with the pathogenesis, the lymph node metastasis, and the clinical stage of papillary thyroid cancer. The MEK/ERK signaling pathway may be activated by BRAF in papillary thyroid cancer.","title":"[Expression of BRAF and its extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signal pathway in papillary thyroid cancer].","pubmedId":"23000762"}
