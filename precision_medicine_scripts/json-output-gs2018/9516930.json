Expression of these glycolipid antigens on melanoma tissues can be assessed by immunohistochemistry or biochemical analysis. These methodologies, however, are not logistically practical or sensitive for testing metastatic melanoma cells in blood or in tissue biopsies. In the present study, we hypothesized that the enzyme involved in GM2 and GD2 synthesis, beta 1--\u003e4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (beta 1--\u003e4GalNac-T), can be a useful marker for detection of occult metastatic melanoma. A reverse transcription PCR and Southern blot assay to detect beta 1--\u003e4GalNac-T mRNA expression was developed. Beta 1--\u003e4GalNac-T mRNA was detected in all 13 melanoma cell lines tested. Metastatic melanoma of lymph nodes and different organ sites expressed beta 1--\u003e4GalNac-T mRNA at various levels. Detection sensitivity of the reverse transcription PCR assay was 1 ng of total RNA extracted from tumor specimens and approximately 5 melanoma cells in 20 million normal donor peripheral blood lymphocytes. In assessment of blood from 126 melanoma patients, beta 1--\u003e4GalNac-T mRNA was more frequently found in advanced-stage melanomas and in patients showing more aggressive tumor progression. Normal donor blood samples (n \u003d 37) were all negative for beta 1--\u003e4GalNac-T mRNA expression. These results suggest that beta 1--\u003e4GalNac-T mRNA is a promising molecular marker for detecting melanoma cells, characterizing antigen expression, and monitoring tumor progression.","title":"Assessment of messenger RNA of beta 1--\u003e4-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase as a molecular marker for metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"9516930"}
