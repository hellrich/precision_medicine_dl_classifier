The thyroid is a useful model since, in addition to multiple tumour stages, it presents two distinct \u0027pathways\u0027 of tumorigenesis: \u0027follicular\u0027 tumours, in which ras oncogene mutations occur at high frequency and \u0027papillary\u0027 tumours, associated with ret (or trk) activation. We have used these observations to reconstruct early thyroid tumorigenesis, using amphotropic retroviral vectors. When introduced into normal thyroid epithelial cells, mutant ras induces self-limiting growth of well-demarcated, differentiated colonies--a phenotype consistent with follicular adenoma. Activated ret on the other hand induces smaller, poorly-demarcated colonies with a morphology consistent with early papillary tumours. Mutant p53--which occurs only in the latest stages of thyroid cancer--was without effect. Our results provide the first direct experimental evidence in a human epithelium for alternative initiating oncogenes and their determination of the subsequent \u0027direction\u0027 of tumour development.","title":"In vitro reconstruction of tumour initiation in a human epithelium.","pubmedId":"8302590"}
