This investigation developed and validated QrtPCR assays for each transcript to provide rapid assessment of breast cancer phenotype for canine cancers, based on ER1, PR and c-erbB-2/HER2 expression, similar to human disease. Roles for relatively underexplored c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4 receptor expression in each of these breast cancer phenotypes were also evaluated. Each quantitative assay was validated by assessment of amplicon size and DNA sequencing following amplification. Differential expression of ER1, PR and c-erbB-2 in CMT cell lines clearly defined distinct human-like breast cancer phenotypes for a selection of canine mammary tumor-derived cell lines. Expression profiles for EGFr family genes c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4 in CMT models also provided an enriched classification of canine breast cancer identifying new extended phenotypes beyond the conventional luminal-basal characterization used in human breast cancer.","title":"Estrogen receptor-α, progesterone receptor and c-erbB/HER-family receptor mRNA detection and phenotype analysis in spontaneous canine models of breast cancer.","pubmedId":"27515268"}
