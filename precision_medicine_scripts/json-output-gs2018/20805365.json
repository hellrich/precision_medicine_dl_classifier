These mutations result in an accumulation of Î±-ketoglutarate to R (2)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). To further clarify the role of this mutation in AML, we have analyzed IDH1R132 in 1414 AML patients. We detected IDH1R132 mutations in 93 of 1414 patients (6.6%) with a clear prevalence in intermediate risk karyotype group (10.4%, P \u003c .001). Although IDH1R132 mutations can incidentally occur together with all other molecular markers, there were strong associations with NPM1 mutations (14.2% vs 5.4% in NPM1wt, P \u003c .001) and MLL-PTD (18.2% vs 7.0% in MLLwt, P \u003d .020). IDH1-mutated cases more often had AML without maturation/French-American-British M1 (P \u003c .001), an immature immunophenotype, and female sex (8.7% vs 4.7% in male, P \u003d .003) compared with IDH1wt cases. Prognosis was adversely affected by IDH1 mutations with trend for shorter overall survival (P \u003d .110), a shorter event-free survival (P \u003c .003) and a higher cumulative risk for relapse (P \u003d .001). IDH1 mutations were of independent prognostic relevance for event-free survival (P \u003d .039) especially in the age group \u003c 60 years (P \u003d .028). In conclusion, these data show that IDH1R132 may significantly add information regarding characterization and prognostication in AML.","title":"IDH1 mutations are detected in 6.6% of 1414 AML patients and are associated with intermediate risk karyotype and unfavorable prognosis in adults younger than 60 years and unmutated NPM1 status.","pubmedId":"20805365"}
