We present a case of metastatic RCC in a 75-year-old woman, initially presenting with haematuria and vaginal pain. Workup further revealed a renal tumor and a vaginal mass. A nephrectomy and local vaginal excision were performed, leading to the diagnosis of metastatic RCC. This case illustrate the variability in RCC presentation. Also, because vaginal clear cell carcinoma is rare, all such lesions should be considered potentially renal in origin.","title":"[Vaginal metastasis from renal cell carcinoma].","pubmedId":"18655352"}
