Neuroblastoma is a childhood tumor of the primitive sympathetic nervous system. It is at once one of the most common and one of the most deadly tumors of childhood. The prognosis for children with this tumor has not changed in the past two decades. Clearly, a fresh approach to neuroblastoma is needed. The neuroscientist has much to add to our understanding and treatment of neuroblastoma and its sequelae. Conversely, neuroblastoma has much to teach us regarding the normal development of the neural crest and the aberrant loss of neurons in this lineage. A neuroscientist\u0027s approach to neuroblastoma, its biology and clinical features, is presented herein.","title":"Neuroblastoma as a neurobiological disease.","pubmedId":"10222436"}
