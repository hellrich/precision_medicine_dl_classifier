We previously demonstrated that trogocytosis also occurs between tumor target and cognate melanoma Ag-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL). In this study, we show that, following trogocytosis, immune effector cells acquire molecular components of the tumor, including surface Ags, which are detectable by specific mAbs. We demonstrate that CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells from melanoma patients\u0027 PBMC and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) capture melanoma Ags, enabling identification of trogocytosing lymphocytes by staining with Ag-specific Abs. This finding circumvents the necessity of tumor prelabeling, which in the past was mandatory to detect membrane-capturing T cells. Through the detection of melanoma Ags on TIL, we sorted trogocytosing T cells and verified their preferential reactivity and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, tumor Ag-imprinted T cells were detected at low frequency in fresh TIL cultures shortly after extraction from the tumor. Thus, T cell imprinting by tumor Ags may allow the enrichment of melanoma Ag-specific T cells for research and potentially even for the adoptive immunotherapy of patients with cancer.","title":"Imprinting of lymphocytes with melanoma antigens acquired by trogocytosis facilitates identification of tumor-reactive T cells.","pubmedId":"23626012"}
