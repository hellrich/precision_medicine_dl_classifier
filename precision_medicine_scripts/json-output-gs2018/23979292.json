Among 41 patients with de novo mutations, MEN 2B was diagnosed in 12 patients after recognition of nonendocrine manifestations [intestinal ganglioneuromatosis (6 patients), oral symptoms (5 patients), ocular (\"tearless crying\") (4 patients), and skeletal stigmata (1 patient) alone or concomitantly]. In the remaining 29 patients with de novo mutations, the diagnosis of MEN 2B was triggered by symptomatic MTC (28 patients) or pheochromocytoma (1 patient). The former patients, being significantly (P \u003c 0.001) younger (means of 5.3 vs 17.6 years) and having lower calcitonin levels (means of 115 vs 25,519 pg/mL), smaller tumors (67% vs 0% were â‰¤10 mm) and less often extrathyroidal extension (0% vs 81%), lymph node (42% vs 100%), and distant metastases (8% vs 79%), were biochemically cured more often (58% vs 0%).\nMTC is curable in patients with de novo mutations when nonendocrine MEN 2B components are quickly appreciated and surgical intervention is performed before patients turn 4 years old.","title":"Surgical curability of medullary thyroid cancer in multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B: a changing perspective.","pubmedId":"23979292"}
