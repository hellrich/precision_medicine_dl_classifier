To define their sites of action, we examined the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) during burn wound healing in rat skin by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. In cryostat sections of intact skin, little or no staining was observed. After a burn, however, staining for FGFR-1 was found in newly forming epidermis. The suprabasal layer of such epidermis, composed mostly of regenerating keratinocytes, was stained intensely, whereas keratinocytes in newly forming hair follicles were devoid of staining. Staining gradually decreased week by week after wound closure and was hardly visible 10 weeks after the burn, when the thickness of the epidermis had returned to the normal level. Staining was also found in small blood vessels and capillaries of granulation tissues of the dermis. Western blot analysis using the same antiserum was performed in the newly forming epidermis 10 d after the burn. A single band was detected with an apparent molecular weight of 120 kDa, corresponding to the short membrane-bound form of rat FGFR-1. Our study indicates that FGFR-1 is expressed during wound healing, mainly in regenerating epidermis and to some extent in blood vessels of the dermis. Fibroblast growth factors may affect the proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes as well as angiogenesis in the dermis via the FGFR-1 expressed during wound healing.","title":"Protein expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 in keratinocytes during wound healing in rat skin.","pubmedId":"9204964"}
