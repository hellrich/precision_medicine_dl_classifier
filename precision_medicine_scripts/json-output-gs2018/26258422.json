RESULTS from phase I clinical studies using the ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib indicate response rates of 70 - 80% and a median progression-free survival of about 19 months. The therapy was generally well tolerated.\nNSCLC harbouring ROS1-translocations can be treated with targeted therapy leading to promising response and survival in patients. Hence, these alterations should be included into current molecular testing panels in stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinomas.","title":"[ROS1-Translocations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer].","pubmedId":"26258422"}
