This study was aimed to determine whether combining recombinant p14(ARF) with antisense complementary DNA of EGFR could improve the therapeutic effectiveness in LSCC.\nAfter human larynx cancer cells (Hep-2) were infected with recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-p14(ARF) and Ad-antisense EGFR) together or alone in vitro, the proliferation and cell cycle distribution of Hep-2 cells were detected by MTT assay and flow cytometer analysis, respectively. Furthermore, the antitumor effects of recombinant adenoviruses together or alone on Hep-2 xenografts were examined in vivo. The levels of p14(ARF) and EGFR expressed in Hep-2 cells and xenografts were determined by western blot assay.\nAd-p14(ARF) combining with Ad-antisense EGFR markedly inhibited the Hep-2 proliferation compared with alone (P\u003d0.001, P\u003d0.002 respectively). Combination of Ad-p14(ARF) and Ad-antisense EGFR led to the proportion of Hep-2 cells in G0/G1 phases increased by up to 86.9%. The down-expression of EGFR protein and overexpression of p14(ARF) protein were observed in vitro and in vivo, and this effect was preserved when Ad-p14(ARF) was combined with Ad-antisense EGFR. Besides, Ad-p14(ARF) plus Ad-antisense EGFR significantly (P\u003c0.05) increased the antitumor activity against Hep-2 tumor xenografts comparing with Ad-p14(ARF) or Ad-antisense EGFR alone.\nCombination Ad-p14(ARF) with Ad-antisense EGFR significantly increased the antitumor responses in LSCC. An effectively potential gene therapy to prevent proliferation of LSCC was provided.","title":"Improved therapeutic effectiveness by combining recombinant p14(ARF) with antisense complementary DNA of EGFR in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26545468"}
