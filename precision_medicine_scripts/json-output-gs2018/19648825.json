Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of nuclear YB-1 and EGFR family proteins in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n \u003d 104).\nIn the five NSCLC cell lines, expressions of EGFR, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), HER3, and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) in PC-9 cells; of HER2 and c-Met in EBC-1 cells; and of HER3 in QG56 cells were down-regulated by YB-1 knockdown. By immunohistochemical analysis, we observed that HER3 expression was significantly negatively correlated with nuclear YB-1 expression in squamous cell carcinoma (p \u003d 0.038). HER2 expression was positively correlated with nuclear YB-1 expression in adenocarcinoma (p \u003d 0.052). Nuclear expression of YB-1 correlated with overall survival of all patients (p \u003d 0.028) and of patients with adenocarcinoma (p \u003d 0.007). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in therapeutic efficacies of gefitinib between patients with nuclear YB-1 expression and those with non-nuclear YB-1 expression in patients with NSCLC (p \u003d 0.004, n \u003d 26) but not between those with high and those with low expression of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and c-Met.\nNuclear YB-1 expression might be essential for the malignant phenotype in lung cancer patients and might be an important biomarker for the development of therapeutic strategy against NSCLC.","title":"Nuclear Y-box binding protein-1, a predictive marker of prognosis, is correlated with expression of HER2/ErbB2 and HER3/ErbB3 in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"19648825"}
