It results in more deaths (over 10,000 annually) than rectal cancer. Furthermore, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing at a rate faster than that of nearly any other cancer and the reasons for the increase are not well understood. A variety of tumor-suppressor genes (including p53, APC, DCC and Rb) and proto-oncogenes (including prad1, EGFR, c-erb-2 and TGF alpha) may be involved in the development and progression of esophageal cancer. Clinical prognostic factors include stage, Karnofsky performance status, sex, age, anatomic location of the tumor, and degree of weight loss. A new staging system based on depth of wall penetration and lymph node involvement correlates well with prognosis for patients undergoing esophagectomy. Newer staging procedures including endoscopic ultrasound as well as the use of minimally invasive surgery, such as thoracoscopy and laparoscopy, may allow accurate staging without esophagectomy. Surgical resection provides excellent palliation; however, the chance for cure with esophagectomy alone is only 10% to 20%. Adjuvant treatment with pre- or postesophagectomy radiation may improve local-regional control but does not improve survival. Nor has preoperative chemotherapy been shown to improve survival; however, it remains an active area of investigation. Multimodality therapy, namely, chemotherapy and radiation (chemoradiation), given concurrently prior to surgical resection shows promise, with one study indicating a 5-year survival of 34%. A complete pathologic response to chemoradiation correlates with improved survival. Chemoradiation has been shown to be superior to radiation as primary management of esophageal cancer. There has been no successfully completed randomized trial of surgery versus definitive radiation or chemoradiation. However, chemoradiation represents a reasonable alternative to esophagectomy in the primary management of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and chemoradiation also appears to be effective in the treatment of patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, offering significant palliation and a chance for long-term survival as well. Randomized studies of preoperative chemoradiation versus surgery or versus chemoradiation alone are needed. The treatment of advanced esophageal cancer must be directed toward palliation of symptoms. Newer endoscopic techniques, including the use of expansile metal stents, laser ablation, intraluminal high-dose rate brachytherapy, BICAP tumor probe, or photodynamic therapy, offer selected patients short-term palliation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","title":"Esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"7533069"}
