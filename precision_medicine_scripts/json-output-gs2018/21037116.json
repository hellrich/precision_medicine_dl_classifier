Women were followed up for an average of 13.3 years to document any breast cancer incidence. Lobular involution was categorized as none, partial, or complete; parenchymal pattern was classified using the Wolfe classification as N1 (nondense), P1, P2 (ductal prominence occupying \u003c25%, or \u003e25% of the breast, respectively), or DY (extremely dense). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess associations of lobular involution and MBD with breast cancer risk were estimated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.\nAfter adjustment for MBD, having no or partial lobular involution was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer than having complete involution (none: HR of breast cancer incidence \u003d 2.62, 95% CI \u003d 1.39 to 4.94; partial: HR of breast cancer incidence \u003d 1.61, 95% CI \u003d 1.03 to 2.53; P(trend) \u003d .002). Similarly, after adjustment for involution, having dense breasts was associated with higher risk of breast cancer than having nondense breasts (for DY: HR of breast cancer incidence \u003d 1.67, 95% CI \u003d 1.03 to 2.73; for P2: HR of breast cancer incidence \u003d 1.96, 95% CI \u003d 1.20 to 3.21; for P1: HR of breast cancer incidence \u003d 1.23, 95% CI \u003d 0.67 to 2.26; P(trend) \u003d .02). Having a combination of no involution and dense breasts was associated with higher risk of breast cancer than having complete involution and nondense breasts (HR of breast cancer incidence \u003d 4.08, 95% CI \u003d 1.72 to 9.68; P \u003d .006).\nLobular involution and MBD are independently associated with breast cancer incidence; combined, they are associated with an even greater risk for breast cancer.","title":"Independent association of lobular involution and mammographic breast density with breast cancer risk.","pubmedId":"21037116"}
