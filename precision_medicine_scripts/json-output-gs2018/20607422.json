In 321 patients we obtained data on SLN microanatomic location/tumor burden (only 7 cases had metastases \u003c0.1 mm); in 137 we additionally analyzed 24-hour collected LY after CLND (multimarker reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [MM-RT-PCR] with primers for tyrosinase, MART1 (MelanA), and uMAGE mRNA (27.7% positive samples)]. Median follow-up time was 41 months.\nAccording to univariate analysis, the following factors had a negative impact on overall survival (OS): higher Breslow thickness (P \u003d .0001), ulceration (P \u003c .0001), higher Clark level (P \u003d .008), male gender (P \u003d .0001), metastatic lymph nodes \u003e1 (P \u003c .0001), nodal metastases extracapsular extension (P \u003c .0001), metastases to additional non-SNs (P \u003d .0004), micrometastases size ≥ 0.1 mm (P \u003d .0006), and positive LY MM-RT-PCR (P \u003d .0007). SN tumor burden showed linear correlation with increasing Breslow thickness (P \u003d .01). The 5-year OS rates for SLN tumor burden \u003c0.1 mm, 1-1.0 mm, and \u003e1.0 mm were 84%/66%/44%, respectively, and for positive and negative LY MM-RT-PCR 47%/0%, respectively. The independent factors for shorter OS (multivariate analysis): male gender, primary tumor ulceration, number of involved nodes ≥ 4, micrometastases size \u003e1.0 mm, and, in additional model including molecular analysis-positive MM-RT-PCR results (hazard ratio [HR] 3.2), micrometastases size \u003e1.0 mm (HR 1.13), and primary tumor ulceration (HR 2.17). Similar results were demonstrated for disease-free survival (DFS) data.\nSN tumor burden categories according to Rotterdam criteria and the positive result of LY MM-RT-PCR assay demonstrated additional, independent prognostic value in SN-positive melanoma patients, showing significant correlation with shorter DFS and OS.","title":"Multimarker reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay in lymphatic drainage and sentinel node tumor burden.","pubmedId":"20607422"}
