Although India has a large HIV infected population, Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma is rare and only 12 cases of AIDS related Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma from India have been reported in the published literature to our knowledge. The 50% of total cases in India has been reported from Mumbai. The incidence of AIDS related Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma is increasing as more than 50% of the cases are reported in 2008 to 2010.\nWe report a case of 26-year-old, HIV seropositive, Indian male with multiple, non-blanching, purplish blue nodular swellings in the palate and right upper eye lid. Similar lesions were also present on the face and the extremities. On the basis of clinical and histopathological examination, a diagnosis of AIDS related Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma was made.","title":"AIDS related Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma presenting with palatal and eyelid nodule.","pubmedId":"23405543"}
