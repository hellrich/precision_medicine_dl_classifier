Serum levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP9 were analyzed in patients with oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal carcinomas in an effort to elucidate the pathobiology and in order to find useful biomarkers of site-specific HNSCC.\nThe study group comprised of 46 patients with HNSCC (21 with oropharyngeal, 21 with laryngeal and 4 with hypopharyngeal cancer). Serum levels of MMP1, -2, and -9 were determined by the MAGPIX multiplex method. P16 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were correlated with clinicopathological features of carcinomas and were compared with respect to tumor site.\nSignificant correlations were confirmed between p16 positivity and oropharyngeal cancer, MMP1 and p16 positivity, and recurrence and smoking. Statistically significant differences in serum levels of MMPs between cancer of different locations were not found.\nMMP1 expression is significantly affected by smoking habit and by p16 and might mediate etiopathogenetical process in cancerogenesis of HNSCC. Our pilot study did not establish any utility of MMP1, -2, or -9 in clinical practice as diagnostic/prognostic markers.","title":"Analysis of preoperative serum levels of MMP1, -2, and -9 in patients with site-specific head and neck squamous cell cancer.","pubmedId":"25503184"}
