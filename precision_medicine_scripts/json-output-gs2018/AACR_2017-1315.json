Previous analyses have examined the impact of estrogen exposure as a risk factor for these tumors, but have found results of varying significance and low effect size. There may be differences in effect of previously discovered risk alleles that contribute to sex differences.METHODS: Using data collected for three previous glioma GWAS in European-ancestry populations (MD Anderson Cancer Center, the San Francisco Adult Glioma Study, and the Glioma International Case Control Study) we assessed sex-specific effects for 14 previously identified and 13 newly identified glioma risk SNPs (27 total) overall and for glioblastoma (GBM) and non-GBM tumors separately. There were 3,892 male cases (59% GBM), 4,522 male controls, 2,500 female cases (52% GBM) and 4,940 female controls. Sex-specific odds ratios (ORM and ORF), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and p values (pM and pF) were generated using stratified logistic regression models. Data from each study were analyzed separately and combined using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis. Results were considered statistically significant at p\u003c6.2x10-4.RESULTS: In GBM, rs11979158 (7p11.2, pM\u003d1.01x10-10, ORM\u003d1.43 [95% CI: 1.28-1.59]; pF\u003d3.43x10-3, ORF\u003d1.22 [95% CI: 1.07-1.39]) and rs2562152 (16p13.3, pM\u003d5.59x10-4, ORM\u003d1.23 [95% CI: 1.09-1.39]; pF\u003d1.22x10-1, ORF\u003d1.12 [95% CI: 0.97-1.29]) had significant effect in males only. In non-GBM gliomas, rs12076373 (1q44, pM\u003d3.56x10-7, ORM\u003d1.41, 95% CI: 1.23-1.61; pF\u003d1.76x10-2, ORF\u003d1.20, 95% CI: 1.03-1.38), rs11979158 (7p11.2, pM\u003d1.77x10-5, ORM\u003d1.32 [95% CI: 1.16-1.49]; pF\u003d2.73x10-1, ORF\u003d1.08 [95% CI: 0.94-1.24]), and rs3751667 (16p13.3, pM\u003d9.44x10-7, ORM\u003d1.30 [95% CI: 1.17-1.44]; pF\u003d5.18x10-2, ORF\u003d1.13 [95% CI: 1.00-1.28]) had significant effect in males only. Effect size for rs55705857 (8q24.21) varied significantly by sex, with ORM\u003d2.63 (95% CI: 2.24-3.09, pM\u003d4.42x10-32), as compared to ORF\u003d3.95 (95% CI: 3.28-4.76, pF\u003d1.82x10-47). A sensitivity analysis was performed due to allele frequency heterogeneity by study and results did not change.CONCLUSIONS: Sex differences and other demographic differences in cancer susceptibility can provide important clues to etiology, and these differences can be leveraged for discovery in genetic association studies. Significant differences in effect size may suggest variation in genetic effect of risk alleles or in unidentified risk factors that vary in prevalence or effect by sex. There may also be differences in the distribution of molecular subtypes within each histology by sex. Further investigation using an agnostic approach may further elucidate the relationship between effect of risk alleles and sex.","title":"Estimating sex-specific effects of genetic loci associated with glioma risk.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-1315"}
