There are still controversies about patient prognosis. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear.\n276 patients (66 ≤45, 210 \u003e45 years) with SCCT were included. Clinical parameters and survival data were assessed. Oncogenes and tumor suppressors were analyzed via immunohistochemistry (p53, CXCR4, p16, EGFR) and qPCR (CDK4, CDKN2A, TP53, MDM2, AKT1, PIK3CA, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, HGF, MET, EGF, ATM, BRCA1, E2F1, FHIT, RUNX3, STK11, BCL2, CTNNB1).\nThe median overall survival was 142 (≤45 years) and 34 months (\u003e45 years) (p \u003c 0.0001; HR [95%CI]: 0.37 [0.30-0.58]). Disease specific survival in patients ≤45 years was with 181 months significantly higher than in patients \u003e45 years (p \u003c 0.0001; HR [95%CI]: 0.33 [0.26-0.57]). Immunhistochemistry visualized a comparable expression of analyzed proteins. QPCR demonstrated in patients ≤45 years a higher expression of genes that are associated with carcinogenesis (CTNNB1, STK11, CDKN2A, HGF, MET) as well as tumor suppressors that constitute an enhanced radio-sensitivity (ATM, BRCA1E2F1, FHIT).\nDerogation of the WNT-CTNNB1-STK11 and CDKN2A-HGF-MET pathway can constitute the carcinogenesis, while the higher expression of radio-sensitizers ATM, BRCA1E2F1 and FHIT can explain the better OS/DSS in young patients.","title":"Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in young patients.","pubmedId":"25633809"}
