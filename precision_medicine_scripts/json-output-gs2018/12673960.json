These diseases are the result of the autosomic dominant inheritance of a mutation in the RET protooncogene, in one out of 12 different known codons. We analyzed 7 families (2 MEN 2A and 5 FMTC). Six mutations were detected in the most frequent codon, 634 (2 MEN 2A y 4 FMTC) and one family with FMTC presented a novel mutation: a transition T \u003e C at codon 630, resulting a C630A change. Among 57 individuals studied, 25 (43.85%) presented the mutation. Seven (28%) were asymptomatic carriers, including 5 children aged 11 +/- 3.2 years. The children underwent total thyroidectomy. The histopathologic examination showed C cells hyperplasia and microcarcinoma focus in both lobes, even in the presence of normal, basal or pentagastrine stimulated, calcitonine levels. In conclusion, we describe a germine novel mutation in the RET protooncogene: C630A; and the corresponding findings of C-cell disease in gene mutated carriers that emphasize the importance of prophylactic thyroidectomy as soon as the molecular diagnosis is confirmed.","title":"[Study of RET protooncogene in multiple endocrine neoplasm 2A and in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma.
