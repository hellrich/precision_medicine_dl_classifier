These mutations are known to cause the proliferation of leukemic cells and inhibit the apoptosis of leukemic cells due to ligand-independent activation of their receptors. Therefore, the current study attempted to investigate the frequency of FLT3 gene mutations and their prognostic implications for AML in terms of treatment response, survival, and relapse.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect D835 and ITD mutations in 84 newly diagnosed AML patients from February 2001 to October 2004. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and direct sequencing were performed to analyze the D835 mutations. The results were examined based on a comparison with previously known prognostic factors, and the treatment outcomes analyzed according to the existence of the mutations in relation to the event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and complete remission (CR) rates.\nD835 and IDT mutations were detected in 4.7% (4/84) and 19.0% (16/84), respectively, of the AML patients. The FLT3 gene mutations were not found to be associated with previously known prognostic factors, such as the WBC count, age, and cytogenetic risk group, but were associated with the lactate dehydrogenase levels. The EFS and OS rates were also significantly lower in the FLT3 gene mutation group, especially in AML with normal karyotypes.\nFLT3 gene mutations were observed in 23.8% of AML patients and appeared to have a prognostic implication on patient survival. Accordingly, the presence of FLT3 gene mutations, which could be tested easily by using PCR/RFLP methods, should be investigated routinely at the time of diagnosis.","title":"[FLT3 Gene Mutations as a Prognostic Factor for Acute Myeloid Leukemia.].","pubmedId":"18156731"}
