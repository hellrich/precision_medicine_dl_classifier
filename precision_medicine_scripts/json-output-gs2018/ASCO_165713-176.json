In preclinical models the combination of savolitinib \u0026 gefitnib was more effective than either compound alone (DCruz et al, 2014; Zhou et al, 2013). EGFR TKI failure is frequently attributable to MET amplification. Methods: The intent of the study is to test that NSCLC pts who progressed on previous EGFR-TKI treatment, can receive treatment with gefitinib \u0026 savolitinib \u0026 potentially demonstrate an improved clinical response. This study (NCT02374645) has 2 phases: safety run-in phase (n~12) \u0026 expansion phase (n~20). Eligibility requires advanced EGFRm+ NSCLC, measurable disease, adequate PS (0-1) \u0026 organ function, progression on any prior EGFR-TKI. MET status is not required for the safety run-in but MET amplification by tumor biopsy confirmation is mandatory in the expansion phase. Data from the safety run-in phase presented here are unvalidated \u0026 preliminary. Results: As of 17 January 2016, 13pts have completed the DLT assessment with fixed dose of gefintinib 250 mg QD in combination with savolitinib at 600 mg QD (n \u003d 6) \u0026 800 mg QD (n \u003d 7). No DLT in the 600mg QD cohort \u0026 a potential DLT of G3 febrile neutropenia in the 800 mg QD cohort. 11pts are evaluable for response \u0026 12pts are evaluable for safety analysis at the data cut off. Drug-related (either gefitinib or savolitinib) adverse events most common across both dose levels were nausea (40% - G1), blood bilirubin increased (30% - G1/2), vomiting (30% - G1). Two confirmed partial responses (pts METamp neg) were reported at 12wks so far with this combination, at 18wks 1pt had PD \u0026 1pt is ongoing. Exposure \u0026 PK parameters for gefitinib \u0026 savolitinib lie within range\u0026 align well with historical data. Conclusions: The toxicity \u0026 PK profile of savolitinib makes rational combination with gefitinib feasible in EGFRm+ NSCLC pts who failed EGFR TKI. The expansion phase in pts with MET amplification will evaluate anti-tumour activity. Reference: DCruz, C et al Cancer Res 2014;74(19 Suppl):Abstract nr 3114.
