Clinical outcome data were obtained from a prospective cohort of 249 patients. Mutations involving NRAS and BRAF(V600E) were detected by PCR and were sequence verified. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to relate NRAS and BRAF mutations to clinical outcome. Seventy-five percentage of NRAS mutations occurred in tumors \u003e1 mm thick (BRAF(V600E) 40%, WT 34%); 75% of NRAS mutations had \u003e1 mitosis/mm(2) (BRAF(V600E) 40%, WT 55%). When compared to WT, multivariate analysis of melanoma-specific survival (MSS) identified NRAS mutations as an adverse prognostic factor [hazard ratio (HR) 2.96; P \u003d 0.04] but not BRAF(V600E) mutations (HR 1.73; P \u003d 0.23). NRAS mutations were associated with thicker tumors and higher rates of mitosis when compared to BRAF(V600E) and WT melanoma and independently of this, with shorter MSS.","title":"Clinical outcome and pathological features associated with NRAS mutation in cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"21615881"}
