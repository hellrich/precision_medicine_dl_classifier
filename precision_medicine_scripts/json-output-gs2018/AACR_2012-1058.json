Mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH1 and IDH2, have been reported in 70% of gliomas, 20% of myeloid leukemias, 56% of chondrosarcomas, and 10% of melanomas. We discovered IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in 29 of 305 (9%) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Tumors with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 had lower 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and higher 5-methylcytosine levels, as well as increased dimethylation of histone H3K79. Mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 were independently associated with longer time to recurrence of cholangiocarcinoma in multivariate analysis (p \u003d 0.046). We identified 2,267 genes that were significantly hypermethylated in tumors with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2. Hypermethylated CpG sites were significantly enriched in CpG shores and in the 1500 bp upstream of annotated transcription start sites, suggesting a global regulation of transcriptional potential. Gene expression profiling of 7 IDH1/2-mutant and 20 IDH1/2-wildtype tumors revealed increased expression of citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, as well as decreased expression of cytoskeleton organization genes. Integrated analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression identified interleukin-6 and several of its downstream targets as candidates for silencing by DNA methylation. Conclusions: Cholangiocarcinomas with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 represent a molecular subclass with distinct signaling pathway alterations.","title":"Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 are associated with DNA hypermethylation in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1058"}
