The encapsulation of floxuridine was achieved through passive entrapment while irinotecan was actively loaded using a novel copper gluconate/triethanolamine based procedure. Coordinating the release rates of both drugs was achieved by altering the cholesterol content of distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC)/distearoylphosphatidylglycerol (DSPG) based formulations. The liposomal retention of floxuridine in plasma after intravenous injection was dramatically improved by decreasing the cholesterol content of the formulation below 20 mol%. In the case of irinotecan, the opposite trend was observed where increasing cholesterol content enhanced drug retention. Liposomes composed of DSPC/DSPG/Chol (7:2:1, mole ratio) containing co-encapsulated irinotecan and floxuridine at a 1:1 molar ratio exhibited matched leakage rates for the two agents so that the 1:1 ratio was maintained after intravenous administration to mice. The encapsulation of irinotecan was optimal when copper gluconate/triethanolamine (pH 7.4) was used as the intraliposomal buffer. The efficiency of irinotecan loading was approximately 80% with a starting drug to lipid molar ratio of 0.1/1. Leakage of floxuridine from the liposomes during irinotecan loading at 50 degrees C complicated the ability to readily achieve the target 1:1 irinotecan/floxuridine ratio inside the formulation. As a result, a procedure for the simultaneous encapsulation of irinotecan and floxuridine was developed. This co-encapsulation method has the advantage over sequential loading in that extrusion can be performed in the absence of chemotherapeutic agents and the drug/drug ratios in the final formulation can be more precisely controlled.","title":"Coencapsulation of irinotecan and floxuridine into low cholesterol-containing liposomes that coordinate drug release in vivo.","pubmedId":"17208196"}
