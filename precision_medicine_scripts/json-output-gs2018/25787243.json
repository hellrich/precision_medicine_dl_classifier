In this case series, we report BRAF V600E-positive histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms in association with lymphomas and lymphoid proliferations. This is a review of cases with immunohistochemistry for BRAF V600E, with additional immunohistochemistry to categorize tumors. We report the first case of BRAF V600E-positive indeterminate cell tumor in association with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. We also report a case of BRAF V600E-positive interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma in a patient with positive B-cell polymerase chain reaction. It is unclear if these neoplasms developed as transdifferentiation of lymphoid neoplasms or if they developed independently. These cases illustrate the expanding spectrum of BRAF V600E-positive histiocytic and dendritic cell tumors and suggest that attention should be paid to lymphomas for possible coincident presentation of these disorders.
