Although hnRNP A18 has recently been associated with several cancers, the exact role of it during the multifactorial process of cancer growth and progression is still unknown. Accordingly, we examined the dependability of various malignant cancer cell lines on hnRNP A18. Down-regulation of hnRNP A18 impaired the proliferative, invasive and migratory properties of melanoma and triple negative breast cancer cell lines in vitro, while overexpression of hnRNP 18 caused an increase in invasiveness. Consistent with these observations, we detected remarkable reduction of tumor growth in two mouse xenograft models, melanoma and breast cancer. Moreover, down-regulation of hnRNP A18 increased the sensitivity of melanoma cells and breast cancer cells to paclitaxel and 5-fluoro uracil, respectively. In conclusion, hnRNP A18 plays a key role in tumor growth and progression. It may serve as a novel target for the treatment of cancer.","title":"hnRNP A18: an emerging novel target for cancer therapy","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-5081"}
