The lack of cell lines with endogenous mutations has been one of the major challenges in studying IDH1/2-mutant glioma and developing novel therapeutics for these tumors. Here, we describe the isolation of a glioma brain tumor stem cell line (BT142) with an endogenous R132H mutation in IDH1, aggressive tumor-initiating capacity, and 2-HG production. The neurosphere culture method was used to establish a brain tumor stem cell line from an IDH1-mutant anaplastic oligoastrocytoma sample, and an orthotopic xenograft system was developed to allow its rapid expansion. Production of 2-HG by glioma cells with endogenous IDH1 mutations was confirmed by mass spectrometry. BT142 retained an endogenous R132H IDH1 mutation in culture and possessed aggressive tumor-initiating capacity, allowing it to be readily propagated in orthotopic xenografts of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune deficiency (NOD SCID) mice. Endogenous 2-HG production by BT142 was detectable in both cell culture medium and xenograft animal serum. BT142 is the first brain tumor cell line with an endogenous IDH1 mutation and detectable 2-HG production both in vitro and in vivo, which thus provides a unique model for studying the biology of IDH1-mutant glioma and in vivo validation of compounds targeting IDH1-mutant cells.","title":"An in vivo patient-derived model of endogenous IDH1-mutant glioma.","pubmedId":"22166263"}
