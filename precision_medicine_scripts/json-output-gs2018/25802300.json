Progression-free survival and adverse effects such as changes in ejection fraction and episodes of neutropenic fever were assessed.\nThe median progression-free survival of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, taxane therapy for previously treated metastatic breast cancer was 4.1 months. The mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction change experienced by patients was -1%. Neutropenic fever events were not encountered.\nPertuzumab, trastuzumab, and taxane therapy seems to confer progression-free survival benefit for previously treated metastatic breast cancer. The use of the dual anti-HER2 antibodies, pertuzumab and trastuzumab, in addition to cytotoxic chemotherapy agents for previously treated metastatic breast cancer should be further evaluated.","title":"Combination pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and taxane for metastatic breast cancer after first progression: a single institution\u0027s experience.","pubmedId":"25802300"}
