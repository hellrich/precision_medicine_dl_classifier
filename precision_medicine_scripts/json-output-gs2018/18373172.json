D2 lymphadenectomy achieves better local control and a lower local recurrence rate than D1 lymphadenectomy.\nThe results achieved with surgical treatment of recurrent gastric cancer in a series of 126 consecutive patients who had been treated with gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy are reported. In-hospital mortality was 1.6%.\nFollow-up of the remaining 124 patients for a median period of 73.6 months detected recurrence in 46 patients (37%). There were 14 local, 12 peritoneal, and 15 distant recurrences. Recurrent gastric cancer was detected within 2 years in 76% of the patients. Of the 46 patients with recurrence, 5 patients (11%) were selected for surgery (4 local and 1 peritoneal recurrence). The median disease-free time after surgery for recurrence was 26 months (range, 14-58 months). There was no in-hospital mortality. The median survival time after surgery for recurrence was 26 months (range, 9-87 months). One patient died during follow-up, while none of the other patients have any evidence of new recurrence.\nSurgery for recurrent gastric cancer is a valid alternative in selected patients, provided it is performed by specialized work teams.","title":"Surgical treatment of recurrent gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"18373172"}
