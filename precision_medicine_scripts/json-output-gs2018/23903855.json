The objective of this study was to identify whether REG1A is expressed in cutaneous melanoma and if REG1A expression status can predict prognosis in cutaneous melanoma patients with metastasis. We also determined whether epigenetic regulation of the promoter region regulates REG1A expression. AJCC stage III cutaneous melanoma specimens with clinically well annotated stage III lymph node melanoma metastasis tissue microarray were assessed by IHC. MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry and HM450K array were used to identify REG1A promoter region CpG site methylation. Chemotherapeutic agent response by melanoma cells as related to REG1A protein expression was assessed. Post-surgery melanoma patients followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with high REG1A expression had a significantly better prognosis (disease-specific survival) compared with patients with low REG1A expression (log rank test; p \u003d 0.0013). The demethylating reagent 5-Aza-2\u0027-deoxycytidine activated REG1A promoter region resulting in enhanced REG1A mRNA and protein expression in melanoma cell lines. Promoter region CpG methylation was shown to regulate REG1A expression in melanoma cells. Moreover, melanoma lines with high REG1A mRNA expression were more susceptible to Dacarbazine and Cisplatin, as compared with those with low REG1A mRNA expression. In conclusion, REG1A expression status may be useful as a biomarker in melanoma patients for sensitivity to these chemotherapeutic agents. The epigenetic regulation of the REG1A promoter region may offer a potential therapeutic approach to improve chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma patients.
