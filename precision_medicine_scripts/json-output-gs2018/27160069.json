Yet, decades ofÂ research aimed to interfere with oncogenic RAS signaling have been largely disappointing and have not resulted in meaningful clinical outputs. Recent advances in disease modeling, structural biology, and an improved understanding of RAS cycling as well as RAS signaling networks have renewed hope for developing strategies to selectively block hyperactive RAS function. This review discusses direct and indirect blocking of activated RAS with a focus on current and potential future therapeutic approaches for NRAS mutant melanoma.
