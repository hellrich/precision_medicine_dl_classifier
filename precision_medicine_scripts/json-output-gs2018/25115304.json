Recent evidence has suggested that other RAS mutations (in exons 3 and 4 of KRAS and exons 2, 3 and 4 of a related gene, NRAS) may also be predictive of resistance.\nSystematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating anti-EGFR mAbs that have assessed tumors for new RAS mutations. Tumors with the new RAS mutations were compared with both tumors without any RAS mutations and tumors with KRAS exon 2 mutations with respect to anti-EGFR treatment progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) benefit.\nNine RCTs comprising a total of 5948 participants evaluated for both KRAS exon 2 and new RAS mutations met the inclusion criteria. Approximately 20% of KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumors harbored one of the new RAS mutations. Tumors without any RAS mutations (either KRAS exon 2 or new RAS mutations) were found to have significantly superior anti-EGFR mAb PFS (P \u003c 0.001) and OS (P \u003d 0.008) treatment effect compared with tumors with any of the new RAS mutations. No difference in PFS or OS benefit was evident between tumors with KRAS exon 2 mutations and tumors with the new RAS mutations. Results were consistent between different anti-EGFR agents, lines of therapy and chemotherapy partners. Anti-EGFR mAb therapy significantly improved both PFS {hazard ratio 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.76]} and OS [hazard ratio 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.99)] for tumors without any RAS mutations. No PFS or OS benefit was evident with use of anti-EGFR mAbs for tumors harboring any RAS mutation (P \u003e 0.05).\nTumors harboring one of the new RAS mutations are unlikely to significantly benefit from anti-EGFR mAb therapy in mCRC.","title":"Extended RAS mutations and anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody survival benefit in metastatic colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials.","pubmedId":"25115304"}
