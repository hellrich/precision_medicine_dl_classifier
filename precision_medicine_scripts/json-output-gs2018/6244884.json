Although this tumour grows slowly, local recurrence and metastatic spread, particularly to lung, are common. The recommended treatment is surgical excision followed by radiotherapy. Postoperative irradiation reduces the frequency of local recurrence caused by residual microscopic disease. The 5- to 10-year actuarial survival rates were 77% and 57%, respectively. Local and regional recurrence can be eradicated by aggressive treatment, either by radical operation or a combination of operation and irradiation.","title":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary glands.","pubmedId":"6244884"}
