Thirty patients achieved complete response (CR, 65%) and the overall response rate was 76% (35/46). Although the CR rate of ENKTL was only 30% (3/10), three subtypes of PTCLs (PTCL-NOS, AITL and ALCL) showed 87% of overall response rate (ORR) (26/30) and 73% of CR rate (22/30). However, the 3-year overall survival and progression-free survival were 47% and 35%, respectively due to frequent relapse after remission. Grade 3/4 leucopenia was the most frequent toxicity whereas neurotoxicity was tolerable: grade 1 or 2 of peripheral neuropathy.\nThe combined treatment of bortezomib and CHOP is an effective and feasible regimen for advanced-stage PTCLs other than ENKTL, with acceptable toxicity. However, future studies exploring new drug combinations are warranted to overcome relapse after remission.","title":"Bortezomib in combination with CHOP as first-line treatment for patients with stage III/IV peripheral T-cell lymphomas: a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial.","pubmedId":"22770877"}
