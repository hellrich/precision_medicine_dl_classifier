This tumour showed RMI features that were totally different from those reported for secondary melanomas, and therefore its nature could not be suspected before surgery. Intracranial primary melanomas are so rare that no other published case is available for comparison, and our tentative explanations for the atypical RMI signals cannot be supported by evidence from the literature.","title":"Apparently primary malignant melanoma of the cerebellopontine angle.
