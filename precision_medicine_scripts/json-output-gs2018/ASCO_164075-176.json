The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology provides a high-throughput and systematic method to identify the genetic alterations in the cancer genome. In this study, we used a broad, hybrid capture-based NGS to discover targetable genetic alterations from advanced gastric cancer (AGC) tissue so that approved molecular target drugs or available agents on clinical trials could be selected. Methods: 31 AGC patients were enrolled and cancer tissue samples were collected after informed consent provided by all patients. 7708 exons of 508 tumor related genes and 78 introns of 19 frequently rearranged genes were assessed for base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. The average median sequencing depth was 470. Results: Somatic mutations were detected in 100% of patients. 9.7% (3/31) could select NCCN guideline approved targeted drugs according to the identified actionable genetic alterations (HER2 gene amplification/ mutation). Remarkably, other targetable genetic alterations were detected in 13 of 31 (41.9%) AGC patients, which applied to mTOR inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, FGFR inhibitors, etc. Conclusions: 51.6% (16/31) of AGC patients harbored at least one actionable genetic alteration identified by NGS testing. NGS based targetable alterations detection might help identify available targeted drugs to personalize target therapy for AGC patients.
