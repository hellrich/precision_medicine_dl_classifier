We speculated that gemcitabine in combination with DNA-damaging agents might be more active against high- than low-p185neu expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells because the high-p185neu expressors were proposed to posses a more effective DNA repair ability. We therefore compared the combination effects of gemcitabine plus cisplatin, gemcitabine plus etoposide, and cisplatin plus etoposide in a panel of 12 NSCLC cell lines. We also investigated the correlations between the level of p185neu and the cytotoxicities of each single agent and the three combinations. We found that as single agents the cytotoxicities of cisplatin and etoposide but not gemcitabine were significantly correlated with the level of p185neu. In contrast to the tight cross-resistance between cisplatin and etoposide, gemcitabine demonstrated little cross-resistance to either etoposide or cisplatin. Both gemcitabine-containing combinations demonstrated equivalent or more active cytotoxicities compared to cisplatin plus etoposide, with gemcitabine plus cisplatin showing a greater synergistic activity which was effect (dose) dependent. The effect of cisplatin plus etoposide was not p185neu related, whereas gemcitabine-containing regimens, especially gemcitabine plus cisplatin, had a greater cytotoxicity against the high- than the low-p185neu expressors. Our findings indicate that gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin is active against NSCLC cells in vitro. The gemcitabine-cisplatin interaction is more active than the etoposide-cisplatin interaction in cells with high-p185neu expression.","title":"Cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine-containing regimens against human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines which express different levels of p185neu.","pubmedId":"8631016"}
