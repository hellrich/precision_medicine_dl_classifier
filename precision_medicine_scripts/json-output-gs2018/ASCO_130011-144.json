PD-L1 expression is common in HNC (Lyford-Pike 2013). In melanoma a T cell-infiltrated phenotype is common and correlates with immune inhibitory pathways. We interrogated the immune microenvironment in a large cohort of HNC in order to identify molecular correlates of an inflamed tumor microenvironment that may predict benefit from checkpoint blockade.  Methods:  We evaluated the presence of a T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment in a cohort of 134 (Chicago HNC Genomics (CHGC)) and 424 TCGA HNC samples using a melanoma expression signature (Harlin/Gajewksi 2009). We evaluated multiple immune-related markers by IHC in a subset of CHGC tumors including CD8 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)(N\u003d73) and PD-L1 (N\u003d55). Results were correlated with genetic and clinical information.  Results:  47% of CHGC and 33% of TCGA tumors showed a T cell-inflamed phenotype (TCIP) similar to melanoma based on a gene expression signature (Harlin 2009).  75% of HPV(+) tumors showed a TCIP compared to 23% of HPV(-) tumors in both cohorts. Mesenchymal subtype (Keck 2014) strongly correlated with TCIP (p\u003c2.2x1016), and 90% of mesenchymal tumors showed TCIP including roughly equal numbers of HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors in both cohorts. Basal and HPV-negative classical HNC tumors were TCIP negative. Based on IHC, 38% of CHCG tumors showed PD-L1 expression and 64% showed CD8+ TILs, both correlating with TCIP. Additional checkpoint molecules were universally co-expressed in the same TCIP tumors including CTLA4, LAG3, PDL-2, and IDO. Molecular processes enriched in non-TCIP tumors included EGFR/erbB signaling (p\u003d0.09) characteristic of basal HNC, while multiple T-cell related signatures and the JAK/STAT pathway (p\u003c0.05) characteristic of mesenchymal HNC were enriched in the TCIP tumors.  Conclusions:  33-47% of HNC show a T cell-inflamed phenotype similar to melanoma. PD-L1 expression and TIL presence is common and strongly correlated with mesenchymal HNC in both HPV(+) and HPV(-) HNC and may benefit from immunotherapy.","title":"Correlation of T-cell inflamed phenotype with mesenchymal subtype, expression of PD-L1, and other immune checkpoints in head and neck cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_130011-144"}
