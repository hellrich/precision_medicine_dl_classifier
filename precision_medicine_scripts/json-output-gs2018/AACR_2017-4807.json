Although T -\u003e A mutations in the transmembrane domain of the neu (c-ErbB-2) gene are the driver mutations in ENU-induced malignant schwannomas, the molecular basis of ENU-induced gliomas was unknown. The objectives of this study were to identify driver mutations in ENU-induced rat gliomas.MethodsWe performed whole-genome sequencing of gliomas that developed in three BDIV and two BDIX rats exposed to a single dose of 80 mg ENU/kg body weight on postnatal day one.ResultsT:A-\u003eA:T and T:A-\u003eC:G mutations, which are typical for ENU-induced mutagenesis, were predominant (41-55% of all somatic single nucleotide mutations). T-\u003eA mutations were detected in all 5 rat gliomas at Braf codon 545 (V545E), which corresponds to the human BRAF V600E. Additional screening revealed that 33 gliomas in BDIV rats and 12 gliomas in BDIX rats all carried a Braf V545E mutation, while peritumoral brain tissue of either strain (n\u003d16) had the wild-type sequence. The gliomas were immunoreactive to BRAF V600E antibody.ConclusionsBraf mutation is a frequent early event in the development of rat gliomas caused by a single dose of ENU.","title":"Braf mutations initiate the development of rat gliomas induced by postnatal exposure to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU).","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-4807"}
