We employed adenovirus-mediated RNA interference technique to knock down c-Met expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and observed its effects on hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Among the five hepatocellular carcinoma and one normal human liver cell lines we analyzed, c-Met was highly expressed and constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in only MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Knockdown of c-Met could inhibit MHCC97-L cells proliferation by arresting cells at G0-G1 phase. Soft agar colony formation assay indicated that the colony forming ability of MHCC97-L cells decreased by approximately 70% after adenovirus AdH1-small interfering RNA (siRNA)/met infection. In vivo experiments showed that adenovirus AdH1-siRNA/met inhibited the tumorigenicity of MHCC97-L cells and significantly suppressed tumor growth when injected directly into tumors. These results suggest that knockdown of c-Met by adenovirus-delivered siRNA may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in which c-Met is overexpressed.","title":"Knockdown of c-Met by adenovirus-delivered small interfering RNA inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma growth in vitro and in vivo.","pubmedId":"16227408"}
