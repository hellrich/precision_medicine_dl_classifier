Recently there has been tremendous progress in the ability to detect driver mutations in lung cancer and large studies presented the frequencies of driver mutations in unselected patient populations. We conducted an association study of known genetic driver events and clinical characteristics with the occurence of SPLC.  Methods:  Within the Network Genomic Medicine Lung Cancer, a local molecular screening network encompassing hospitals and office-based oncologists in the catchment area of the Center for Integrated Oncology Kln Bonn, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 375 molecularly annotated NSCLC patients for their SPLC status and clinical characteristics (age at diagnosis, histology, sex, smoking status). Molecular analysis for lung adenocarcinoma included the EGFR, ALK, BRAF, KRAS and PIK3CA status and for squamous cell lung cancer the FGFR1 and PIK3CA status.  Results:  84 of 375 (22,4%) patients were SPLCs. The median age of SPLC diagnosis was 70 yrs. (Range 53 - 85 yrs.) and differed significantly from the rest of the population with a median age of 65 yrs. (Range 28 - 86 yrs.). The frequency of SPLCs was not significantly different between males and females (p \u003d 0,259). In univariate logistic regression analysis active and former smoking, positive PIK3CA mutation and FGFR1 amplification status as well as age were significantly associated with the occurrence of SPLC. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis including the variables mentioned above only PIK3CA mutations (OR 9,48 95% CI 1,83 - 49,1) (p \u003d 0,007) and age (OR 1,06 95% CI 1,03 - 1,1) (p \u003d 0,015) could be confirmed to be independent prognosticators for the occurrence of SPLCs.  Conclusions:  The occurrence of SPLC was associated with age and PIK3CA mutations in our study population. Further comprehensive investigations on this topic are needed to confirm our findings and to further understand the association between mutation status and SPLCs.","title":"Association of PIK3CA mutations and age with the occurence of second primary lung cancer (SPLC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_114545-132"}
