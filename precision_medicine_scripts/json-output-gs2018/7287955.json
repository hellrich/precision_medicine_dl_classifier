In all of the cases the surface changes and their growth were clinically suggestive of acral lentiginous melanoma, but biopsies revealed their benign nature. This exceptional presentation of congenital acral melanocytic nevi merits recognition by physicians and underscores the need for histologic diagnosis prior to definitive surgery in any cases suspected of being malignant melanoma.","title":"Congenital acral melanocytic nevi clinically stimulating acral lentiginous melanoma.","pubmedId":"7287955"}
