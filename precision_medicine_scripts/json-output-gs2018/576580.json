The preoperative diagnosis, based on mammography and xeroradiography, was fibroadenoma. Grossly, the demarcated lesion resembled a fibroadenoma with islands of cartilage projecting from its cut surface. Histologically, it was composed of benign mature fibrous stroma, fat, breast ducts, and islands of mature cartilage. Most cartilage-containing tumors of the human breast are associated with primary mammary malignant neoplasms. A few of the benign cartilage-containing tumors reported in the literature are discussed. The last case was published in 1909.","title":"Benign chondrolipomatous tumor of the human female breast.","pubmedId":"576580"}
