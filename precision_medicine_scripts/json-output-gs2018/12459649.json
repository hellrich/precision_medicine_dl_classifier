In the laboratory setting, immunohistochemical staining with MIA antibody was performed in paraffin-embedded tissues from six amelanotic uveal melanomas and eight metastatic lesions of uveal melanomas. In the clinical setting, serum samples of 139 patients with uveal melanoma were examined; eight of these patients had overt metastatic disease. Sixty-one initially metastatic disease-free patients were followed over time (median follow-up 240 days, 95% confidence interval 60-883 days) and MIA levels were assessed repeatedly. A one-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify the MIA serum levels. In the laboratory setting, five of the six primary uveal melanomas and seven of the eight metastatic lesions stained immunohistologically positive for MIA. In the clinical setting, the 131 patients without overt metastatic disease demonstrated a median serum concentration of MIA of 6.6 ng/ml. In the eight patients with overt metastatic disease, the median serum concentration of MIA was 26.28 ng/ml. This difference was highly statistically significant (P \u003c 0.001, analysis of variance). During follow-up, three initially metastatic disease-free patients developed overt metastatic disease, and the MIA level increased from a median of 6.6 ng/ml before to 29.2 ng/ml after clinical detection of metastatic disease. In the 58 other patients, the serum level remained stable during the entire follow-up period. In conclusion, MIA is expressed in primary and metastatic lesions of uveal melanomas, and a statistically significant elevation in MIA serum levels in patients who develop metastatic disease due to uveal melanoma indicates its promising role as a serum marker for monitoring uveal melanoma patients for metastasis.","title":"Melanoma inhibitory activity: a novel serum marker for uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"12459649"}
