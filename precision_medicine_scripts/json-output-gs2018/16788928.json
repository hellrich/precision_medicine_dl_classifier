PDT for esophageal and lung carcinomas is approved at a porfimer sodium (Photofrin) dose of 2 mg/kg, but lower doses increase selectivity and decrease both cutaneous phototoxicity and cost. We evaluated low doses of porfimer sodium PDT for treatment of multiple BCC.\nSeventy-seven patients with 2,041 BCC were injected with 0.75, 0.875, or 1.0 mg/kg porfimer sodium and treated 2 days later with 630-nm light. Clinical responses were determined at 6 months, then periodically to 5 years.\nIncreasing porfimer sodium dose increased complete responses (CR), with initial CR rates of 72.7% (66-78%, 95% CI), 79.9% (73-86%, 95% CI), and 92.2% (91-93%, 95% CI), albeit with some lower selectivity at the highest dose. At 1 mg/kg, 5-year recurrence rates were 28% (21-35%, 95% CI) and 15% (11-18%, 95% CI) for sporadic and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) lesions, respectively.\nThis is the largest dose-ranging study of porfimer sodium, and the largest number of lesions treated in a single study. We found that with 1 mg/kg porfimer sodium, PDT can be a selective and durable treatment for sporadic and NBCCS-associated BCC.","title":"A dose ranging study of photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium (Photofrin) for treatment of basal cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16788928"}
