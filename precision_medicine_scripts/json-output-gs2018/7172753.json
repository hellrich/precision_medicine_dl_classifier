Chromosomes were arranged in pairs both by the cytologist and by a previously developed computer programme. The two populations had significant differences in the relative lengths of chromosomes 9 and 10, and in the arm ratio values of 6 and 11. Though the morphometric parameters of the other elements of the complement appeared to be similar, the Rosate population showed significantly higher chromosomal asymmetry. In the Rosate population, there was greater intra-population and intra-individual variability than in the Bagnaia population. The karyotype variations observed suggest that chromosomal rearrangement may have occurred.","title":"Chromosome variation in two populations of the crested newt, Triturus cristatus carnifex, with different melanoma incidence.","pubmedId":"7172753"}
