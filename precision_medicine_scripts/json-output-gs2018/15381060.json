In the single patient with early phase CML who later developed an Imatinib Mesylate-resistance and a Y253H mutation, no mutation was detectable in purified cell fractions analyzed at diagnosis nor in their LTC-IC-derived progeny. In contrast, in three patients in advanced phase CML, ABL-kinase mutations demonstrated in peripheral blood cells by sequencing (Q252E and M351T) were detectable in the FACS-sorted cells and became amplified in the LTC-IC-derived progeny of the primitive cells. These findings demonstrate that in late CP or advanced CML, ABL-kinase mutations occur as an intraclonal event in the primitive Ph1+ stem cell compartments with progression of this clone towards IM-resistant blast phase.","title":"Evidence of ABL-kinase domain mutations in highly purified primitive stem cell populations of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.","pubmedId":"15381060"}
