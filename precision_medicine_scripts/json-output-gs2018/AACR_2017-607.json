Five micrometer sections were stained with rabbitmonoclonal antibody against PDL1.The sections were evaluated for the percentage and intensity of membranestaining in both tumor and immune cells. Cut off was \u003e 1%. Bivariateanalysis was done via Ï‡2 analysis and survivability data was calculated via thegeneration of Kaplan-Meier curves (SPSS v19). Statistical significance wasassumed if p \u003c 0.05.Results: PDL1 expression inonly tumor cells, only immune cells and in combination was associated with ER negative(p\u003c0.0001), PR negative (p\u003c0.0001), Triple negative subtype (p\u003c0.0001)and high grade (p\u003c0.0001) breast ductal cancers.Conclusion: Our study finding of selective expression of PDL1 in triple negative breast ductal cancers (TNBC) in AA women suggests that inhibition of adaptive immune response is involved in the progression of these cancers. PDL1/PD1 is the inhibitory check point of immune response resulting in decreased T cell activation and cytokine production. Some studies have shown that PDL1 expression is associated with loss of PTEN and phosphatide inositol 3 kinase pathway (PI3K) activation. Our previous study showed loss of PTEN in TNBC. Combining PDL1 inhibitors with PI3K inhibitors may be useful therapy for aggressive TNBC.","title":"PDL1 expression associated with triple negative breast ductal carcinomas in African American women.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-607"}
