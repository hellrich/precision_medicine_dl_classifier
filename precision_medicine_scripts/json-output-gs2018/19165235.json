P53 and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) have been reported to control the functionality of PI3K/AKT signaling. In this study we evaluated whether reintroducing P53 using non-viral gene transfer enhances PTEN-mediated inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling by cetuximab in PC3 prostate adenocarcinoma cell line bearing p53 and pten mutations. Signaling phosphoproteins expression was analyzed using Bio-Plex phosphoprotein array and western blot. Apoptosis induction was evaluated from BAX expression, caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation analyses. The results presented show that p53 and pten gene transfer additionally mediated cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by restoral of signaling functionality, which enabled the control of PI3K/AKT and MAPKinase signaling pathways by cetuximab in PC3 cells. These results highlight the interest of the analysis of signaling phosphoproteins expression as molecular predictive markers for response to cetuximab and show that p53 and pten mutations could be key determinants of cell response to cetuximab through the functional impact of these mutations on cell signaling.","title":"P53 and PTEN expression contribute to the inhibition of EGFR downstream signaling pathway by cetuximab.","pubmedId":"19165235"}
