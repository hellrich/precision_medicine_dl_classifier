A propensity score analysis was executed for a balanced comparison of treatment outcomes.\nA total of 127 patients received standard RT-TMZ, whereas 116 patients underwent short-course RT-TMZ. Median overall survival and progression-free survival times were similar: 12 months and 5.6 months for the standard RT-TMZ group and 12.5 months and 6.7 months for the short-course RT-TMZ group, respectively. Radiation schedule was associated with similar survival outcomes in either unadjusted or adjusted analysis. O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation was the most favorable prognostic factor (P\u003d.0001). Standard RT-TMZ therapy was associated with a significant rise in grade 2 and 3 neurologic toxicity (P\u003d.01), lowering of KPS scores during the study (P\u003d.01), and higher posttreatment dosing of corticosteroid (P\u003d.02).\nIn older adults with GBM, survival outcomes of standard and short-course RT-TMZ were similar. An abbreviated course of RT plus TMZ may represent a reasonable therapeutic approach for these patients, without loss of survival benefit and acceptable toxicity.","title":"Standard (60 Gy) or short-course (40 Gy) irradiation plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for elderly patients with glioblastoma: a propensity-matched analysis.","pubmedId":"25442339"}
