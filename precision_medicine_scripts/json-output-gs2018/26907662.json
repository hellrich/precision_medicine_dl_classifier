In English literature, there are 2 adult patients with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma who developed PRES under sorafenib treatment. Our patient is the first pediatric case with the diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia who developed PRES that might be attributed to sorafenib use.\nThus, PRES might be a rare, potentially serious, but manageable, side effect of sorafenib that should be kept in mind by pediatric hematologists and oncologists.","title":"Sorafenib-induced Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome in a Child With FLT3-ITD-positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia.","pubmedId":"26907662"}
