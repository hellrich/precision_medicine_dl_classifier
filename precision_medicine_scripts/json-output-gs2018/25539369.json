It presents more commonly in an elderly population and has no significant gender predominance. Given its rarity, most evidence of the causes, behavior, and treatment approaches for MMHN originates from isolated case reports and retrospective series. Between 1945 and 2011, at least 1951 cases of MMHN have been reported in the literature. Despite numerous technological developments in surgery and radiation therapy, as well as advances in systemic modalities, MMHN is an aggressive malignancy with a very poor prognosis. Complete surgical excision with clear margins remains the primary treatment modality. Adjuvant postoperative radiation therapy may improve locoregional control but does not appear to affect survival. Definitive particle radiation therapy promises to provide high rates of local control for nonoperable patients. Recent molecular evidence suggests that proto-oncogene KIT aberrations in a subset of mucosal melanomas may represent a potential diagnostic value and serve as a therapeutic target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors in an adjuvant setting for patients with advanced MMHN.
