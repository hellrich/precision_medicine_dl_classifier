These methodologies are: morphology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular diagnostics. Additionally, immunophenotypic classifications of ALL and criteria for establishing a diagnosis of ALL independent of morphology are described.","title":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","pubmedId":"10403080"}
