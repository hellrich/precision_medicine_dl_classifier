It included all specimens of mastectomy and lumpectomy with axillary tissue. Incisional, trucut and wedge biopsies as well as all non-epithelial tumours were excluded. All samples were processed as per standard guidelines and were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. SPSS 10 was used for statistical analysis.\nThe age of the 100 cases in the study ranged from 20 to 82 years with a mean of 51+/-17.6 years. Two (2%) of the patients were males. HER-2/neu over-expression increased with increasing tumour size, grade, lymph node metastasis and with oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negativity. No significant correlation of HER-2/neu was seen with the age of patient and with the tumour type.\nThe expression of HER-2/neu was associated with decrease in oestrogen receptor and progresterone receptor positivity, and increase in tumour size, high tumour grade and lymph node metastasis.","title":"Correlation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) receptor status with hormone receptors Oestrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor status and other prognostic markers in breast cancer: an experience at tertiary care hospital in Karachi.","pubmedId":"23901708"}
