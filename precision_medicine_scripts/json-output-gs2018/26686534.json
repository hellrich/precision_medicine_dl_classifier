Results were correlated to clinical data.\nEGFR overexpression was found in 30/60% of ependymomas depending on the antibody used and was more pronounced in WHO grade III. High EGFR gene copy number gains were found in 6 (11%) ependymomas with half of them being amplifications. EGFR amplified ependymomas displayed an EGFR overexpression with both antibodies in two of three cases. A missense mutation in exon 20 of EGFR (S768I) was detected in one amplified case.\nEGFR is frequently overexpressed in ependymomas. Other mechanisms than amplification of the EGFR gene appear to contribute to EGFR overexpression in most cases. EGFR mutations may be present in a small subset of ependymomas.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression is common and not correlated to gene copy number in ependymoma.","pubmedId":"26686534"}
