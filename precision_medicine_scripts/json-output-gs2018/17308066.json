The CD30 signaling pathways that lead to the induction of apoptosis are poorly defined. Here, we show that the induction of apoptosis by CD30 requires concurrent inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which itself is activated by engagement of CD30 with CD30 ligand. Treatment of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells with CD30 ligand and pharmacologic inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, but not with CD30 ligand or inhibitors alone, triggered the activation of caspase-8 and the induction of apoptosis. Caspase-8 activation occurred within a few hours (2.5-4 h) after receptor triggering, was unaffected by the neutralization of ligands for the death domain-containing receptors TNFR1, Fas, DR3, DR4, or DR5, but was abolished by the expression of a dominant-negative form of the adaptor protein FADD. Importantly, we show that expression of the caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP(S) is strongly induced by the CD30 ligand, and that this is dependent on the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Thus, we provide evidence that the induction of apoptosis by CD30 in anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells is normally circumvented by the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These findings have implications for CD30-targeted immunotherapy of anaplastic large cell lymphoma.","title":"Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase unmasks a CD30-triggered apoptotic pathway in anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells.","pubmedId":"17308066"}
