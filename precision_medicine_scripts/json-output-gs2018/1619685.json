Observed numbers of breast cancers in relatives were compared with the expected number derived from the Connecticut Tumor Registry. Multiple logistic regression analysis was also performed.\nRelatives of male patients exhibited a significant twofold increased risk when compared with expected rates and no difference in risk when compared with that of relatives of female patients. Prostate cancer in the family of a male patient resulted in a significant fourfold increased breast cancer risk compared with a risk of 1.4 in families with no history of prostate cancer. A family history of lung cancer, colon cancer, or melanoma had no effect on increasing risks of breast cancer.\nThe familial effect of male breast cancer is the same as that of female breast cancer.\nAny estimates of breast cancer risk provided to individuals should also consider the occurrence of prostate cancer in the family, since prostate cancer appears capable of at least doubling the underlying twofold risk.","title":"Breast cancer risks in relatives of male breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"1619685"}
