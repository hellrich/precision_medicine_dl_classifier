We reported previously that both EGFR- and Her2-overexpressing tumors are sensitive to the new EGFR-selective TK inhibitor gefitinib (ZD1839, \"Iressa\"), and sensitivity to this agent correlated with its ability to down-regulate Akt. However, EGFR-overexpressing MDA-468 cells, which lack PTEN function, are resistant to ZD1839, and ZD1839 is unable to down-regulate Akt activity in these cells.\nTo study the role of PTEN function, we generated MDA468 cells with tet-inducible PTEN expression.\nWe show here that the resistance of MDA-468 cells to ZD1839 is attributable to EGFR-independent constitutive Akt activation caused by loss of PTEN function in these cells. Reconstitution of PTEN function through tet-inducible expression restores ZD1839 sensitivity to these cells and reestablishes EGFR-stimulated Akt signaling. Although restoration of PTEN function to tumors is difficult to implement clinically, much of the effects of PTEN loss are attributable to overactive PI3K/Akt pathway signaling, and this overactivity can be modulated by pharmacologic approaches. We show here that pharmacologic down-regulation of constitutive PI3K/Akt pathway signaling using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 similarly restores EGFR-stimulated Akt signaling and sensitizes MDA-468 cells to ZD1839.\nSensitivity to ZD1839 requires intact growth factor receptor-stimulated Akt signaling activity. PTEN loss leads to uncoupling of this signaling pathway and results in ZD1839 resistance, which can be reversed with reintroduction of PTEN or pharmacologic down-regulation of constitutive PI3K/Akt pathway activity. These data have important predictive and therapeutic clinical implications.","title":"Resistance to gefitinib in PTEN-null HER-overexpressing tumor cells can be overcome through restoration of PTEN function or pharmacologic modulation of constitutive phosphatidylinositol 3\u0027-kinase/Akt pathway signaling.","pubmedId":"14555504"}
