NRAS mutations are mutually exclusive with KRAS and BRAF mutations and contribute to the activation of Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. Previous experiences evaluated the prognostic/predictive role of NRAS mutations suggesting a poorer prognosis and resistance to anti-EGFRs for NRASmutant (mut) mCRC pts. The aim of the present study was to confirm such preliminary findings in a large cohort of mCRC pts.  Methods:  Data on KRAS (codons 12, 13 and 61) and BRAF-V600E mutational status of mCRC pts referred to our pathology from \u002709 to \u002712 were collected. NRAS mutational status (codons 12, 13 and 61) was evaluated in KRAS and BRAF wt pts. OS was calculated from date of diagnosis of metastatic disease. Data on response and PFS according to RECIST were collected for NRASmut irinotecan-refractory pts treated with anti-EGFRs +/- irinotecan.  Results:    774 mCRC pts were included. KRAS/BRAF mutations were found in 384 (50%)/69 (9%) cases. NRAS was mut in 47 (15%) out of 318 KRAS and BRAF wt pts. NRAS mut pts had significantly shorter OS in comparison to KRAS-BRAF-NRAS wt pts (HR\u003d0.60 [0.29-0.99] p\u003d0.045). BRAF mut pts had significantly worse OS in comparison to NRAS mut pts (HR\u003d1.75 [1.073-2.87] p\u003d0.03). No difference was observed between NRAS mut and KRAS mut pts (HR\u003d0.86 [0.51-1.43] p\u003d0.61).  18 pts out of 47 NRAS mut pts received anti-EGFRs in advanced lines. 8 pts (7 cetuximab-based, 1 panitumumab monotherapy) were evaluable according to RECIST criteria and therefore eligible for the present analysis. None of them responded and only 1 SD was observed. Pooling our results with available data on anti-EGFRs activity in NRASmut pts in advanced lines of treatment (De Roock, 2010; Peeters, 2013; Andr, 2012), only 1 response is described out of 35 treated pts (2,9%).  Conclusions:  Our data demonstrate that NRAS mutations have a relevant incidence in KRAS and BRAF wt mCRC pts. Present results are consistent with previous experiences and confirm that NRAS mutations affect prognosis of mCRC patients and predict lack of response to anti-EGFRs. Further insights into NRAS mut mCRC biology and prospective validation are warranted.","title":"Analysis of NRAS mutation as poor prognostic indicator and predictor of resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (anti-EGFRs) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients (pts).","pubmedId":"ASCO_115168-132"}
