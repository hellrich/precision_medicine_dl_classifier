Among 10 patients 7 patients were males and 3 patients were females, the ratio of male to female was 7:3, median age was 45 (17-61) years.\nAfter treatment by using decitabine combined with modified CAG regimen, 7 patients achived complete remission, 1 patient achived partial remission, 2 patient did not achieve remission, the overall remission rate was 80% (8/10), the median time of white blood cell count recovery was 18.5 (5-28) days, median time of platelet level recovery was 19 (12-29) days. The main side effects of treatment were myelosuppression. There was no new lung infection in all cases, one case died of exacerbation of primary lung infection after therapy.\nThe treatment of decitabine combined with modified CAG regimen for relapsed and refractory AML shows high response rate, low side effects, so it worthy to further clinical study.","title":"[Clinical resarch of decitabine combined with modified CAG regimen for treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia].","pubmedId":"25687052"}
