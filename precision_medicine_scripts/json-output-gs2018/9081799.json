Germ-line mutation had already been suspected on clinical grounds in 76% of the carriers, 24% being discovered in a presymptomatic stage. Six children among the latter were treated prophylactically by thyroidectomy, histological evidence of C-cell hyperplasia being found in all of them, microcarcinomas in three of the older children. There were four patients among the non-carriers on whom thyroidectomy had been performed previously because of a false-positive pentagastrin-test; but germ-line mutation was now excluded. In one family, with familial MTC in two brothers, no mutation in ret-proto-oncogene has been demonstrated. The members of this family must now, as used to be routine, undergo a pentagastrin-test. Three of the 81 patients with \"sporadic\" MTC had a germ-line mutation, presumably a new one.\nMolecular-genetic tests have further improved the management of families with hereditary MTC and they thus take first place among essential diagnostic procedures. The diagnosis of sporadic MTC can be confirmed by excluding germ-line mutation in the ret-proto-oncogene.","title":"[Mutations of ret-proto-oncogene in thyroid medullary carcinoma].","pubmedId":"9081799"}
