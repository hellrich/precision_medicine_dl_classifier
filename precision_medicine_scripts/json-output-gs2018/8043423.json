The amplified product was then analysed both by dot-blotting and by direct sequencing for point mutations. By the dot-blotting technique, mutations were seen in 18 of 100 lesions. These were in one of five distant metastases (20%), in one of three nodal metastases (33%), in four of 31 (13%) primary melanomas, in none of 18 dysplastic naevi, and in 12 of 43 (28%) congenital naevi, all at codon 61. On direct sequencing, nine of 18 mutations were confirmed, in two of 31 (6%) primary tumours, one distant metastasis, and six of 43 (14%) congenital naevi. Of the 23 superficial spreading melanomas examined, eight were on sun-exposed skin. A superficial spreading melanoma, in which the N-ras mutation at codon 61 was confirmed, was on non-exposed skin, and an unconfirmed mutation was from an exposed site. One of three nodular melanomas with a confirmed mutation was on a light-exposed site, and the other two nodular melanomas were from non-exposed areas. All four lentigo maligna melanomas were from exposed sites, and one of these had an unconfirmed mutation. The only acral lentiginous melanoma, which had no mutation, was from a sun-exposed area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Point mutations in the N-ras oncogene in malignant melanoma and congenital naevi.","pubmedId":"8043423"}
