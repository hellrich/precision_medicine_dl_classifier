We compared constitutional and tumoural genotypes at different restriction fragment length polymorphism loci (RFLP) on chromosomes 10 and 17 in 15 unrelated individuals. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) pointing to chromosomal loss or deletions was detected for at least one chromosome 17 marker in 11 gliomas (astrocytomas grades I-III and glioblastoma multiforme), whereas LOH for chromosome 10 loci was only detected in 3 out of 9 cases of glioblastoma multiforme and was not detected in low grade gliomas. Since LOH for chromosome 10 loci seems to be restricted only to glioblastoma multiforme, it is possible that recessive mutations on chromosome 10 are engaged in tumour progression from astrocytomas to glioblastoma multiforme. As LOH of chromosome 17 markers occurs in astrocytomas as in glioblastoma multiforme, chromosome 17 loci probably are involved in early tumour development.","title":"Loss of constitutional heterozygosity in human astrocytomas.","pubmedId":"1357919"}
