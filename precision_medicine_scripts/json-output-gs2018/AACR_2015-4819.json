Liposarcomas (LPS) and Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) are two of the most common histotypes, accounting for approximately 25% and 30% of all soft tissue sarcomas, respectively. The most frequent form of LPS is represented by a spectrum of disease including well-differentiated LPS (WDLPS), a non-metastasizing but locally recurrent disease with adipocytic differentiation, and de-differentiated LPS (DDLPS), an aggressive, frequently metastasizing high grade sarcoma which can arise in conjunction with elements of WDLPS. Besides the known oncogenic KIT or PDGFRA driver mutations in GIST, somatic alterations in RB1, deletions in PTEN, MDM2 amplifications in LPS, and TP53 mutations in LMS are the most commonly reported genomic aberrancies identified in sarcomas. Both WDLPS and DDLPS share amplification of 12q13-15, a genomic region containing the MDM2 and CDK4 loci, yet little is understood about the other genetic processes that yield such different phenotypes. In LMS, recurrent mutations in TP53 have been identified, but a detailed analysis of primary and metastatic tumors has not previously been described.To evaluate genetic events in these transitions, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on trios comprising normal tissue, WDLPS, and DDLPS obtained from individual patients (n \u003d 19), as well as on trios of normal tissue, primary and metastatic LMS tumors obtained from separate individual patients (n \u003d 8). Consistent with prior reports of the molecular characterization of LPS, we observed arm-level amplifications in Chr 12 in all LPS samples, and Chr 17 amplification in many LMS cases. There were no shared somatic alterations across paired WDLPS and DLPS pairs from individual patients aside from the common Chr 12 amplification (MDM2 \u0026 CDK4). A higher mutation rate was observed in LMS, and there were many clonal somatic alterations shared between the primary and metastatic lesions of individuals.This study demonstrates the heterogeneity of evolution between different subtypes of sarcomas using whole exome sequencing of clinical specimens. This finding has implications for better understanding of the molecular drivers of these tumors and opportunities to identify subtype-specific therapeutic targets.","title":"Differential evolution of tumor heterogeneity in leiomyosarcomas and liposarcomas suggested by genomic profiling","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4819"}
