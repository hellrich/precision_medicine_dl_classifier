Telomerase activity was detected by using Telomerase ELISA Kit (BÃ¶hringer Manheim, Germany). The median and interquartile ranges of telomerase activity in normal lung, NSCLC and SCLC were 65 and 51-75, 106 and 58-349 and 285 and 117-2214, respectively. Normal lung, NSCLC and SCLC had significantly different telomerase activity (p \u003c or \u003d 0.0001). Between NSCLC and SCLC, SCLC exhibited higher telomerase activity than did NSCLC (p\u003d0.0029). A cut-off level of absorbance [A450nm-A690nm] of 86 derived from 90% specificity in normal lung was used; sensitivity for overall lung cancer, NSCLC and SCLC was 62.8%, 54.1% and 84.0%, respectively. There was no significant difference in telomerase activity between each stage in NSCLC (p\u003d0.9243). In SCLC, however, the median and interquartile range of telomerase activity in extensive disease (2128 and 292-2681) was significantly higher than those in limited disease (207 and 97-252) (p\u003d0.0285).","title":"Telomerase activity in endoscopically visible lung cancer.","pubmedId":"11848543"}
