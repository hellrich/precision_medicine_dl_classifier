Standard chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide failed to slow the disease progression. Subsequent administration of vemurafenib (960 mg twice a day) resulted in complete tumor response after 8 weeks of treatment. Literature data on the use of vemurafenib and dabrafenib in non-melanoma BRAF-mutated tumors are reviewed.","title":"BRAF-mutated clear cell sarcoma is sensitive to vemurafenib treatment.","pubmedId":"26286452"}
