This alteration is associated with poor prognosis, and may affect response to hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab can significantly improve the treatment efficacy and survival of Her-2/neu overexpressing breast cancer patients. Docetaxel is an effective drug used for metastatic breast cancer recently. This study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of trastuzumab combined with docetaxel in the treatment for metastatic breast cancer patients with overexpressed Her-2/neu.\nTwenty-two metastatic breast cancer patients with overexpressed HER2/neu were entered into the study. Trastuzumab and docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) were administrated on day 1 and repeated every 21 days. The initial dose of trastuzumab was 8 mg/kg and subsequent doses were 6 mg/kg.\nOverall 96 cycles were administrated to the 22 patients (medium three cycles per patient, range 2-6 cycles). All cases were evaluable. The overall response rate was 63.6% (14/22). Two patients achieved complete response (CR), 12 patients achieved partial response (PR), four patients achieved stable disease (SD), and four patients had progressive disease (PD). The median time to progression was 5.4 months. One year overall survival was 59.0%. The major toxicity was myelosuppression. A few patients had fever at first infusion of trastuzumab and minor heart failure.\nTrastuzumab combined with docetaxel is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for Her-2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.","title":"[Efficacy and toxicity of trastuzumab combined with docetaxel for Her-2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer].","pubmedId":"18799033"}
