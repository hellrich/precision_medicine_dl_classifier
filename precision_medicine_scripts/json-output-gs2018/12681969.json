Flt3 is activated by binding of its natural Flt3-ligand (Flt3-L), but Flt3 genes with internal tandem duplications (Flt3-ITD) or Asp(D)-835 point mutations encode molecules with constitutive activation. The aim of this study was to compare functional effects of exogenous Flt3-L on AML blast populations with and without genetic Flt3 abnormalities.\nNative AML blasts were derived from 64 consecutive patients with high blast counts in peripheral blood, and in vitro models were used to characterize the Flt3-L effects.\nThe Flt3 protein levels showed a similar wide variation between AML blast populations with and without genetic Flt3 abnormalities. Flt3-L was an autocrine growth factor only for 2 patients. Flt3-ITD+ AML cells had lower responsiveness to exogenous cytokines than cell populations without Flt3 abnormalities, but exogenous Flt3-L increased blast proliferation both for patients without Flt3 abnormalities and patients with Flt3-ITD as well as D835 mutations. This enhancement was observed even in the presence of other exogenous cytokines and included clonogenic AML progenitors. Flt3-L inhibited proliferation only for 1 patient, but had divergent effects on AML blast cytokine release. Flt3-L affected AML blast differentiation (inhibition of erythroid colonies, increased neutrophil granulation) only in a minority of patients, whereas it had an anti-apoptotic effect for a larger subset of patients.\nIntracellular signaling initiated by Flt3 ligation modulates the functional phenotype for native human AML blasts both with and without genetic Flt3 abnormalities.","title":"Flt3-mediated signaling in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts: a functional characterization of Flt3-ligand effects in AML cell populations with and without genetic Flt3 abnormalities.","pubmedId":"12681969"}
