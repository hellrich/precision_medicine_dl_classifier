No dominant CDK4 Arg24Cys mutation was seen in our samples. Comparatively high frequency of CDKN2A alterations (except homozygous deletion) was found in dysplastic head and neck lesions and remained almost constant or increased during progression of the tumour, whereas the homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and the alterations in CCND1 and RB1 genes were seen mainly in the later stages of the tumour.\nOur study suggested that mutation/hypermethylation/allelic alterations (LOH/MA) of CDKN2A were associated with the development of dysplastic head and neck lesions. All the other alterations might provide some cumulative effect during progression of later stages of the tumour to have selective growth advantages.","title":"Differential alterations of the genes in the CDKN2A-CCND1-CDK4-RB1 pathway are associated with the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in Indian patients.","pubmedId":"14586645"}
