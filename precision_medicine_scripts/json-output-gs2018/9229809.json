This subtype of lymphoma is designated anaplastic large-cell Hodgkin\u0027s related lymphoma (ALCL related to HD) and is considered by some authors as a secondary anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.","title":"[KI-1-positive, anaplastic, large-cell lymphoma related to Hodgkin\u0027s disease].","pubmedId":"9229809"}
