Recently, genetic variations have been considered as important factors to cancer susceptibility and prognosis. More specifically, genetic polymorphisms have been associated with the development and prognosis of HNSCC. The purpose of the current study was to investigate an association among p16 (CDKN2A) gene polymorphism at rs11515, age, and HNSCC aggressiveness. PCR-RFLP analysis was used to investigate the p16 (CDKN2A) gene in 96 patients with HNSCC and in 100 individuals without HNSCC. A case group was categorized by age in younger (\u003c60 years) and older (â‰¥ 60 years) patients. Differences between the case and control groups were determined using Fisher and chi-squared tests. Time of survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up visit or to the date of death using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and comparing this to the log-rank test. Statistical significance was set at p\u003c0.05. In the present study, no association was established between HNSCC and rs11515 polymorphism, as indicated in a previous study. We found that HNSCC individuals with large-sized tumors and with metastatic disease presented worse overall survival, consistent with fundamental concepts that establish the effects of tumor size and lymph node metastasis to HNSCC outcomes. This study identified that there is no difference in the distribution of rs11515 between the control and HNSCC groups. In addition, no differences between rs11515 genotypes and clinicopathological parameters were observed.","title":"p16 (CDKN2A) SNP rs11515 was not associated with head and neck carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24633888"}
