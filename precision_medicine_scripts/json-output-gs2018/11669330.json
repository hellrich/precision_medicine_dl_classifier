The treatment protocol could not be completed in eight patients. The acute hematologic toxicities of grade III or IV occurred in 48.4%, (15/31) after the first chemotherapy cycle, and in 39.1% (9/23) after the second cycle. The most common non-hematologic toxicity was radiation esophagitis. Surgery was attempted in 23 patients and successful in 22 patients (resection rate \u003d 71.0%. Pathologic complete response and down-staging were achieved in 13.6% (3/22) and 68.2% (15/22). The median survival period, 2-year overall survival, local control and disease-free survival rates of all 31 patients and of 22 patients who underwent surgery were 19 months, 37.2%, 49.1%, 35.5%, and 19 months, 43.2%, 51.8%, 25.6%, respectively. On the basis of our observations, preoperative CCRT followed by surgery for stage IIIA NSCLC has resulted in outcomes comparable with those in previous reports.","title":"Preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"11669330"}
