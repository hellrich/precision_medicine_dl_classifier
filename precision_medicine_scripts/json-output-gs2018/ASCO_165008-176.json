{"publicationTypes":["2016 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: Immunotherapies have advanced the treatment of metastatic melanoma (MM); however they are associated with frequent immune-related toxicities. As a result, patients with pre-existing autoimmune conditions were commonly excluded from clinical trials studying immunotherapies in metastatic melanoma. Since limited information is available on pre-existing autoimmune comorbidities in real-world patients with MM, we sought to estimate prevalence of autoimmune comorbidities and the change over time in this population. Methods: Definitions of autoimmune disorders included in this study were obtained from the American Autoimmune-Related Diseases Association. Prevalence of autoimmune disorders and time trend over a period of 10 years from 2004 to 2014 were estimated in patients with newly diagnosed mm as well as in patients with newly diagnosed non-MM, and in the general population. Prevalence rates and trends were compared among these 3 populations to delineate the potential role of disease vis--vis time on prevalence trends. Data were obtained from MarketScan, a large US claims database. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between risk factors and pre-existing autoimmune disorders in MM. Results: A list of 147 autoimmune disorders was examined in this study. Among 12,028 patients with newly-diagnosed MM, the prevalence rate for autoimmune disorders increased 1.7-fold from 17.1% in 2004 to 28.3% in 2014 (P \u003c 0.001). The prevalence rates were lower in patients with non-MM (11.7% in 2004 to 19.8% in 2014) and in the general population (7.9% in 2004 to 9.2% in 2014), but the rates increased 1.7- and 1.2-fold over time, respectively. Additionally, female, bone or gastrointestinal metastasis, and high comorbid disease burden were found to be associated with higher risk of autoimmune disorders. Conclusions: Prevalence of autoimmune comorbidities is high and increases over time in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic melanoma. Comorbid autoimmune disorders should be taken into consideration when treatment decisions are made.","title":"Prevalence of autoimmune comorbidities in patients with metastatic melanoma in the US.","pubmedId":"ASCO_165008-176"}
