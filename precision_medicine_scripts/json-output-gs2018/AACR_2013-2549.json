{"genes":["Prostate stem cell antigen","PSCA","SNP rs2294008"],"publicationTypes":["2013 AACR Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Through a genome-wide association analysis using a total of 7,035 duodenal ulcer cases and 25,323 controls of Japanese populations, we identified two susceptibility loci at the Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) on 8q24 and at the ABO blood group (ABO) on 9q34. A C-allele of rs2294008 at PSCA increased the risk of duodenal ulcer (odds ratio (OR) of 1.84 with P value of 3.92 x 10-33) in a recessive model, while it decreased the risk of gastric cancer (OR of 0.79 with P value of 6.79 x 10-12) as reported previously. A T-allele of SNP rs2294008 created the upstream translational initiation codon and affects the protein localization from cytoplasm to cell surface. SNP rs505922 on ABO also associated with duodenal ulcer in a recessive model (OR of 1.32 with P value of 1.15 x 10-10). Our finding implies the crucial roles of genetic variations on the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer.","title":"A genome-wide association study identifies PSCA as a susceptibility locus for gastric cancer and duodenal ulcer in the Japanese population.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-2549"}
