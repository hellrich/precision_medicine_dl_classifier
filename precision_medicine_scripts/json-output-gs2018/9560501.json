We report incidence, clinical behaviour and outcome of rare variants of papillary thyroid cancers at Asir Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia. These variants differ from each other not only on a morphometric basis, but also in clinical behaviour. Accordingly, we report our experience of different variants in a series of 35 papillary carcinomas. These cases were received in the surgical pathology laboratory of Asir Central Hospital from January 1987 to December 1994. We have reviewed clinical charts, microscopic slides and pathological reports of these carcinomas. The following results have been obtained: 20 cases were classical (usual) papillary thyroid carcinomas: seven were follicular variants; three were tall cell/ columnar variants; two were oxyphilic variants; and one was a diffuse sclerosing variant. There were two de-differentiated papillary carcinomas (anaplastic carcinomas with foci of well-differentiated papillary carcinomas). These variants were also correlated with clinical parameters such as age, sex and nationality of the patients, aggressiveness of the tumours, types of surgery required, and follow-up when available.","title":"Variants of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid: experience at Asir Central Hospital.","pubmedId":"9560501"}
