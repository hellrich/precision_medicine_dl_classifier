In both acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identification of these chromosome abnormalities is increasingly becoming important clinically for diagnosis and prognosis, and as a result selection of therapy. This paper first briefly reviews the recurring chromosome changes now recognized in ANLL and ALL. The prognostic utility of classification of acute leukemia according to karyotype is then discussed.","title":"The clinical significance of chromosomal changes in acute leukemia.","pubmedId":"3892539"}
