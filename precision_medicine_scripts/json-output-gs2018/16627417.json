Data were collected from pacemaker diagnostics, and the first 43 patients underwent 24-h Holter recordings before being discharged from the hospital with AAIsafeR2 activated. No adverse event related to AAIsafeR2 was observed. All ventricular pauses detected on Holter tapes triggered immediate back-up ventricular pacing. Appropriate switches to DDD occurred in 97 of 123 patients. In 69 of 123 devices (56%) switches to DDD were non-sustained, and the average % ventricular pacing in this group was 0.2+/-0.5%.\nAAIsafeR2 mode seems to be safe and reliable in patients with infrequent slowing or pauses in ventricular activity, while maintaining ventricular pacing below 1%.","title":"Use of a new cardiac pacing mode designed to eliminate unnecessary ventricular pacing.","pubmedId":"16627417"}
