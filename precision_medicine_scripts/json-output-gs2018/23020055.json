The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of MetS among 40- and 50-year-old (y.o.) inhabitants of Wroclaw, Poland.\nThe study group included Wroclaw inhabitants who were recruited between 2001-2004 into the Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Programme. The study group consisted of 18,583 participants (females: 40 y.o.--5,248 and 50 y.o.--5,329; males: 40 y.o.--4,229 and 50 y.o.--3,777). The MetS was defined by IDF/NHLBI/AHA (2009) criteria.\nMetS was found in 12.7% of 40 y.o. and in 33.1% of 50 y.o. females, while in males, respectively, in 30.4% and 42.1%. Overall, MetS occurred in 28.5% of the study group. MetS occurred significantly more frequent among the older than the younger groups, both in females and males. MetS was found significantly more frequent among males than females from Wroclaw, in both 40- and in 50 y.o. participants. Among those females with MetS, the most frequently (more than 90% in both age groups) occurred excessive waist circumference (WC), followed by elevated blood pressure-BP (72.1% of 40 y.o., 86.8% of 50 y.o.). Excessive WC, elevated BP and triglycerides-TG was found in more than 80% of males aged 40 and with diagnosed MetS. Among the older group of males with MetS, the most frequently occurred elevated BP (90.4%), followed by excessive WC (87%) and elevated TG (78.5%).\nMetS was diagnosed more frequent in males than females of Wroclaw. Prevalence of MetS increased with age. The most significant impact on reducing the prevalence of MetS in the study group would be the lowering of BP and WC to recommended values.","title":"Prevalence of metabolic syndrome among 40- and 50-year-old inhabitants of Wroclaw, Poland.","pubmedId":"23020055"}
