Recent studies revealed high ratios of loss of the IKZF1 gene             which encodes IKAROS in BCR-ABL1+ ALL and lymphoblastic crisis (LBC) of CML. However,             little is known about the cooperativity between the aberrant IKAROS and BCR-ABL1             in primary human hematopoietic cells. We investigated the effects of expression             of BCR-ABL1 and/or IK6, a natural dominant negative isoform of IKAROS, on proliferation             and differentiation of human CD34+ cord blood cells with or without human bone             marrow-derived stromal cells which support early B cell differentiation. Cell             proliferation was remarkably enhanced by co-expression of BCR-ABL1 and IK6, with             reduced expression of glycophorin A and increased expression of CD41, especially             on stromal cells, compared with expression of BCR-ABL1 alone that resulted in             expansion of erythroid progenitors. Interestingly, p190BCR-ABL1 showed higher             dependency on stromal cells to stimulate cell growth with IK6, than p210BCR-ABL1.             Furthermore, the cooperation was found to depend on direct cell adhesive interaction             of hematopoietic progenitors with stromal cells. These findings suggest that IK6             and BCR-ABL1 synergistically contribute to leukemogenesis in human bone marrow             stromal microenvironment, and may provide a clue to elucidate the mechanisms of             leukemogenesis of Ph+ ALL and CML-LBC.","title":"IKAROS isoform 6 enhances BCR-ABL1-mediated proliferation of human CD34+             hematopoietic cells on stromal cells.","pubmedId":"21901249"}
