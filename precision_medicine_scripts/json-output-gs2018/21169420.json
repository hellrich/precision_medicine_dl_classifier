In this study, we show that MDM2 significantly enhanced estrogen receptor α (ERα) and ERα/specificity protein-mediated transactivation in MCF-7 and ZR-75 breast cancer cells. This was demonstrated by both MDM2 overexpression and knockdown experiments by RNA interference. ERα interacted with wild-type MDM2 and deletion mutants of MDM2 containing amino acids 1-342 (C-terminal deletion) and 134-490 (N-terminal deletion), but not 134-342. In contrast, only wild-type but not mutant MDM2 enhanced ERα-mediated transactivation. Protein-protein interactions in vitro were 17β-estradiol (E(2)) independent, whereas fluorescent resonance energy transfer experiments in living cells showed that E(2) enhanced ERα-MDM2 interactions. Subsequent RNA interference and mammalian two-hybrid experiments suggested that MDM2 did not directly interact with endogenous coactivators such as the steroid receptor coactivators but played a role in enhancing ERα-mediating gene expression and estrogen responsiveness through interactions with ERα.","title":"MDM2 regulates estrogen receptor α and estrogen responsiveness in breast cancer cells.","pubmedId":"21169420"}
