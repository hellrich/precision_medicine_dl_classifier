Then, 337 both male and female subjects were enrolled and divided on the basis of sex, cigarette smoking habit and kind of task. Exposure to airborne Pb, dosage of total blood Pb and peripheral blood count were carried out. A significant positive correlation was detected between the values of total blood Pb and values of plasma reticulocytes (%RET) both in the total sample and for all the classes of the subdivision except for police drivers. Some statistically significant correlations were present but discontinuous for other variables of peripheral blood counts. Results suggest that occupational exposure to low doses of airborne Pb is able to influence lines of the hematopoietic system in exposed workers, with special reference to %RET.
