The aims of this study were to examine to what extent the presence of ER in melanoma tumours might relate to disease progression and whether disease progression relates to patients\u0027 sex steroid status. Additionally, levels of two soluble adhesion molecules [circulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and circulating vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1)] were examined as independent, possibly prognostic indicators of disease progression. ER immunocytochemical assay identified only two lesions (out of 69 investigated) which had any evidence of the receptors, and staining in these lesions was very modest. No significant changes in oestrone or androstenedione levels were noted for male or female patients with disease progression. As expected, oestradiol levels reflected the menopausal status of the female patients but, for all post-menopausal female patients and male patients, there was no significant relationship to tumour stage. However, a significant decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin occurred with disease progression in male but not female patients, and sex differences in the levels of soluble adhesion molecules were also seen in advanced metastatic disease.","title":"Investigation of oestrogen receptors, sex steroids and soluble adhesion molecules in the progression of malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"9195558"}
