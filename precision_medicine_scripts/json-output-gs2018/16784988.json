Previous studies have reported differences in apoptotic rate and expression levels of apoptosis regulatory proteins between ALK+ and ALK- ALCL. In this study, we assessed for expression of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway proteins cytochrome c, apoptosis protease-activating factor 1, and procaspase 9 in 2 ALK+ ALCL cell lines and 42 ALCL tumors (17 ALK+, 25 ALK-). We used the Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cell lines, and the inhibitors Z-LEHD-FMK (specific for caspase 9) and Boc-D-FMK (general caspase inhibitor) to investigate the role of caspase 9 activation in chemotherapy-induced apoptotic cell death. Caspase 9 activity was significantly increased in Karpas-299 and SU-DHL-1 cells after chemotherapy treatment, but remained as low as control levels with addition of either caspase inhibitor. Both caspase inhibitors rescued a substantial fraction of Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cells from drug-induced cell death. In ALCL tumors, expression of cytochrome c, apoptosis protease-activating factor 1, and procaspase 9 was also assessed and correlated with apoptotic rate and activated caspase 3 levels. Cytochrome c was expressed in all 13 (100%) ALK+ and 18 (95%) of 19 ALK- ALCL tumors. Apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 was detected in 14 (88%) of 16 ALK+ and 19 (79%) of 24 ALK- ALCL tumors. Procaspase 9 was expressed in 5 (30%) of 17 ALK+ and 2 (8%) of 25 ALK- ALCL tumors (P \u003d .09). In the entire study group (ALK+ and ALK- ALCL), procaspase 9 expression levels significantly correlated with apoptotic rate (P \u003d .02) and activated caspase 3 levels (P \u003d .05). This correlation could not be shown in the ALK+ or ALK- ALCL subgroups, presumably because of the small sample size. In conclusion, chemotherapy-induced cell death in ALK+ ALCL cells involves the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and apoptosome function may be an important determinant of apoptosis in ALCL tumors.","title":"Intrinsic apoptotic pathway in anaplastic large cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"16784988"}
