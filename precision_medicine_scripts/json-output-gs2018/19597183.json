In contrast, little is known about the microenvironment\u0027s role in T cell-derived NHL. B7-H1 (PD-L1, CD274), a member of the B7 family of costimulatory/co-inhibitory ligands expressed by both malignant cells and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment, has emerged as an important immune modulator capable of suppressing host immunity. Therefore, B7-H1 expression and function were analyzed in cutaneous and peripheral T-cell NHL. B7-H1 was expressed by tumor cells, monocytes, and monocyte-derived cells within the tumor microenvironment in T-cell NHL and was found to inhibit T-cell proliferation and promote the induction of FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells. Collectively, the data presented provide the first evidence implicating B7-H1 in the suppression of host immunity in T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and suggest that the targeting of B7-H1 may represent a novel therapeutic approach.","title":"B7-H1 (PD-L1, CD274) suppresses host immunity in T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.","pubmedId":"19597183"}
