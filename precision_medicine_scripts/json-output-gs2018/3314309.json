We used antibodies against the HNK-1 epitope, which is shared between natural killer cells and the nervous system, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, neurofilaments, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and myelin basic protein (MBP). HNK-1 immunoreactivity was detectable in nearly all neuroectodermal tumors. Especially in those derived from the neuroepithelium, which include the various types of gliomas, we observed a strong staining with this antibody. The only exceptions were the choroid plexus papillomas and individual ependymomas. In tumors derived from the neural crest HNK-1 reactivity was more variable and less intense. In other tumors of the nervous system HNK-1 was not detectable, except for two out of four malignant lymphomas. In addition to its reactivity with human lymphocytes HNK-1, therefore, seems to be a useful \u0027marker\u0027 for neurogenic tumors in general. GFAP expression was prominent in all astrocytomas and the astrocytic cells within mixed gliomas and gangliogliomas. Immunoreactivity was more variable in glioblastomas and ependymomas, while only isolated GFAP-positive cells were present in oligodendrogliomas, medulloblastomas, one plexus papilloma, and some neurinomas. Vimentin immunoreactivity was found in tumor cells of nearly all tumors of the central nervous system with the exception of oligodendrogliomas, most plexus papillomas, neuronal tumors and most medulloblastomas.","title":"Differential expression of glial- and neuronal-associated antigens in human tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system.","pubmedId":"3314309"}
