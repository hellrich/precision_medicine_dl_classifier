To date, rare cases are on record. Here, 4 new cases of the tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma of the breast are described in women aged from 45 to 80 years old. All patients presented with palpable breast nodules and were treated with quadrantectomy. One patient presented with a long clinical history and a metastatic intramammary lymph node. The patient is alive and well 3 months after surgery. The remaining 3 patients are disease free at mean 7.5 months (range, 5 to 10 months) after surgery. These data suggest that papillary thyroid-like carcinomas of the breast show malignant potential.","title":"Breast tumor resembling the tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: report of 4 cases with evidence of malignant potential.","pubmedId":"17172492"}
