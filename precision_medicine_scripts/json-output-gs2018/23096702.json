To further define the pathways to melanoma, we explored the relationship between germline and somatic mutations in a series of melanomas collected from 134 Spanish and 241 Austrian patients. Tumor samples were analyzed for melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) variants and mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes. Detailed clinical data were systematically collected from patients. We found that NRAS-mutant melanomas were significantly more likely from older patients and BRAF-mutant melanomas were more frequent in melanomas from the trunk. We observed a nonsignificant association between germline MC1R status and somatic BRAF mutations in melanomas from trunk sites (odds ratio (OR) 1.8 (0.8-4.1), P\u003d0.1), whereas we observed a significant inverse association between MC1R and BRAF for melanomas of the head and neck (OR 0.3 (0.1-0.8), P\u003d0.02). This trend was observed in both the Spanish and Austrian populations.","title":"NRAS and BRAF mutations in cutaneous melanoma and the association with MC1R genotype: findings from Spanish and Austrian populations.","pubmedId":"23096702"}
