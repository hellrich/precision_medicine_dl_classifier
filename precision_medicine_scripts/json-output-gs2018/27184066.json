In many cancers, hyaluronan synthesis is altered, which implicates disease progression and metastatic potential. We have previously shown that synthesis of hyaluronan and expression of its synthases 1-2 (HAS1-2) decrease in cutaneous melanoma, compared to benign melanocytic lesions.\nIn the present study, we compared immunohistological staining results of HAS1 and HAS2 with clinical and histopathological parameters to investigate whether HAS1 or HAS2 has prognostic value in cutaneous melanoma. The specimens consisted of 129 tissue samples including superficial (Breslow ≤ 1 mm) and deep (Breslow \u003e 4 mm) melanomas and lymph node metastases. The differences in immunostainings were analysed with non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Associations between immunohistological staining results and clinical parameters were determined with the χ(2) test. Survival between patient groups was compared by the Kaplan-Meier method using log rank test and Cox\u0027s regression model was used for multivariate analyses.\nThe expression of HAS1 and HAS2 was decreased in deep melanomas and metastases compared to superficial melanomas. Decreased immunostaining of HAS2 in melanoma cells was significantly associated with several known unfavourable histopathologic prognostic markers like increased mitotic count, absence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and the nodular subtype. Furthermore, reduced HAS1 and HAS2 immunostaining in the melanoma cells was associated with increased recurrence of melanoma (p \u003d 0.041 and p \u003d 0.006, respectively) and shortened disease- specific survival (p \u003d 0.013 and p \u003d 0.001, respectively).\nThis study indicates that reduced expression of HAS1 and HAS2 is associated with melanoma progression and suggests that HAS1 and HAS2 have a prognostic significance in cutaneous melanoma.","title":"Decreased expression of hyaluronan synthase 1 and 2 associates with poor prognosis in cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"27184066"}
