Preclinical studies demonstrated that tivantinib has a broad-spectrum anti-tumor activity, especially in cells expressing high levels of MET. A randomized Phase II study in second-line hepatocellular carcinoma showed statistically significant improvement in time to progression with tivantinib compared to a placebo. Noteworthy, a significant pronounced benefit in time to progression and overall survival was observed in MET-high patients. In addition, MET expression was defined as a negative prognostic factor. The most frequent adverse events were hematologic events. A Phase III study in the MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma is actively recruiting patients. Phase II and III studies in non-small-cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer are ongoing.","title":"Tivantinib: a new promising mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"23414466"}
