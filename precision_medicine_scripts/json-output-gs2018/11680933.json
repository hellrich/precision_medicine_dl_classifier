EGF, EGFR and c-erbB-2 positive cases were preferentially found in penetrating type rather than in superspreading type (p \u003c 0.05, p \u003c 0.01, and p \u003c 0.05, respectively). The positive rates of EGFR and c-erbB-2 were significantly higher in submucosal gastric carcinoma than in intramucosal gastric carcinoma (p \u003c 0.01, p \u003c 0.05, respectively). These results suggested that the autocrine mechanism of the growth factors and the expression of c-erbB-2 were correlated to the degree of gastric wall invasion.","title":"Evaluation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-erbB-2 in superspreading-type and penetrating-type gastric carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11680933"}
