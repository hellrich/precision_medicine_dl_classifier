Germline mutations in the CDKN2A locus, encoding the key tumor suppressor proteins p16/INK4A and p14/ARF, are frequently present in kindreds with hereditary cutaneous melanoma but have seldom been reported in families with genetic susceptibility to head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).\nWe report the pedigree of a patient with an unusually high incidence of HNSCC and melanomas. CDKN2A mutation analysis was performed with standard capillary sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.\nA previously unreported germline CDKN2A mutation affecting only the p16/INK4A open reading frame, c.106delG (p.Ala36ArgfsX17), was detected in the proband. This mutation causes a premature termination codon.\nOur report emphasizes the need to consider germinal CDKN2A mutations in the differential diagnosis of familial HNSCC and the importance of awareness of these tumors in carriers of CDKN2A mutations.","title":"Novel germline CDKN2A mutation associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas.","pubmedId":"22083977"}
