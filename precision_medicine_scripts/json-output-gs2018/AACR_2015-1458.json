Thus, resected patient tumor tissue directly implanted into immune compromised mice followed by therapy and tumor growth analysis is thought to be the closest preclinical model to predict patient therapeutic responses. To date, few models are available for the different histotypes of thyroid cancer derived from follicular thyrocytes; these include papillary, follicular, Hurthle cell, squamous and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. We have developed eight PDX models in athymic nude mice representing all of these subtypes. The models have been extensively characterized for mutational status (i.e. BRAF, telomerase, RAS, PTEN, TP53, RB, etc) as well as validation by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis to match that of the originating patient tumor tissue. Squamous and anaplastic thyroid cancers are rare tumor types with no FDA approved therapies. Each model demonstrated their own unique responses to radiation, cytotoxic or molecular targeted therapies such as doxorubicin, sorafenib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), cisplatin, paclitaxel, sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor), trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor). We expect that these models may provide useful in vivo models for thyroid cancer research as well as models for therapeutic guidance based upon histotype, mutational status and response to therapies.","title":"Characterization of novel thyroid PDX models and their response to combination therapies","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-1458"}
