Previous studies based on cell culture and xenograft animal models suggest that Smad3 has tumor suppressor function for breast cancer during early stages of tumorigenesis. Here we show that DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene), a chemical carcinogen, induces mammary tumor formation at a significantly higher frequency in the Smad3 heterozygous mice than in the Smad3 wild type mice. This is the first genetic evidence showing that Smad3 inhibits mammary tumorigenesis in a mouse model. Our findings provide strong support that Smad3 has important tumor suppressor function for breast cancer.","title":"Carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced mammary tumorigenesis is accelerated in Smad3 heterozygous mice compared to Smad3 wild type mice","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4070"}
