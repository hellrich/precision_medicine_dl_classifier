Essential defining features comprise of a proliferation of large lymphoid cells with strong expression of the cytokine receptor CD30 and a characteristic growth pattern. Using molecular and clinical criteria three entities of ALC-lymphoma have been identified: primary systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ALC-lymphoma, primary systemic ALK-negative ALC-lymphoma and primary cutaneous ALC-lymphoma. The ALK expression in the primary systemic ALC-lymphoma entity is caused by chromosomal translocations, most commonly t(2;5), and can nowadays be reliably detected by immuno-histology. ALK-positive ALC-lymphoma predominantly affects young male patients and if treated with chemotherapy has a favourable prognosis. They show a broad morphological spectrum, with the \"common type\", the small cell variant and the lymphohistiocytic variant being most commonly observed. The knowledge of the existence of these variants is essential in establishing the correct diagnosis. ALK-negative ALC-lymphomas occur in older patients, equally affecting both genders and have an unfavorable prognosis. The morphology and the immuno-phenotype of primary cutaneous ALC-lymphoma shows an overlap with that of lymphomatoid papulosis. Both diseases have an excellent prognosis and secondary systemic dissemination is only rarely observed. The ALC-lymphomas described above derive from T cells and are generally accepted as biological entities. In contrast, large B-cell-lymphomas with anaplastic morphology are now believed not to represent an own entity but a morphologic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Malignant lymphomas with morphological features of both Hodgkin- and ALC-lymphoma have formerly been classified as ALCL Hodgkin-like. Recent immuno-histological analysis of these cases however suggests that ALCL Hodgkin-like does not represent an own lymphoma entity. Most of these cases are likely to be examples of tumor cell rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma, while a minority of these cases appear to fall either into the category of ALK-positive or ALK-negative ALC-lymphoma.","title":"[The many faces of anaplastic large cell lymphoma].","pubmedId":"10840818"}
