In primary melanomas, the polyclonal anti-p53 antibody CM-1 detected immunoreactivity in 70% of the lesions, predominantly in the cytoplasm. Signals were observed in this cellular compartment in 57% of the melanomas, whereas in 32% nuclear p53 over-expression was detected. Immunohistochemistry, using the monoclonal antibody DO-1, revealed lower staining frequencies. However, both antibodies showed congruent results in approximately 80% of the cases. Overall, immunoreactivity was observed in 73% of superficial spreading melanomas, but only in 52% of lentigo maligna melanomas. This difference (P \u003c 0.001) was mainly due to a lower frequency of cytoplasmic immunoreactivity (P \u003c 0.002). There was no difference with respect to cytoplasmic and nuclear immunoreactivity between thin (\u003c 1 mm thickness) and thicker primary melanomas. Staining frequencies detected in metastatic lesions seemed to be lower than in primary tumours. In 103 primary melanomas, follow-up data for at least 5 years were available. In 71% (54 of 76) of the primary melanomas which did not recur, and in 78% (21 of 27) of tumours with subsequent metastases, p53 over-expression was detected by CM-1. However, this difference was not statistically significant. The results of the present study indicate that immunoreactivity to anti-p53 antibodies is a common observation in malignant melanomas, with staining signals predominantly found in the cytoplasm of cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Expression of p53 protein in malignant melanoma: clinicopathological and prognostic implications.","pubmedId":"7669636"}
