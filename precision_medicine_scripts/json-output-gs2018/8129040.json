To study tissue-specific and/or tumor-specific expression of the NF1 gene product, now called neurofibromin, immunostaining and immunoblotting were applied to the N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (ENU)-induced Syrian hamster neurofibromatosis model using polyclonal antibodies against the NF1 fusion protein and a synthetic peptide. Strong expression was observed specific to the Schwann cells of the normal peripheral nerves by immunostaining. Neoplastic Schwann cells showed specific binding of anti-NF1; however, the frequency of positive cells was diminished. Immunoblotting also revealed positive expression of the 250-kd NF1 gene product in the brain, the normal peripheral nerves, and 7 of 14 ENU-induced neurofibromas. Although ENU-induced melanoma and Wilms\u0027 tumor were negative for neurofibromin, foci of Schwannian differentiation in both primary and transplanted melanomas were positive. These results suggest that neurofibromin plays some role in differentiation and growth regulation of the Schwann cell.","title":"Specific expression of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene (NF1) in the hamster Schwann cell.","pubmedId":"8129040"}
