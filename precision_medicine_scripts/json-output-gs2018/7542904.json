Loss of NF1 gene expression has been reported in Schwann cell tumors (neurofibrosarcomas) from patients with NF1 as well as in malignant melanomas and neuroblastomas from patients without NF1. Previously, we demonstrated the lack of neurofibromin expression in six pheochromocytomas from patients with NF1, supporting the idea that neurofibromin might be an essential regulator of cell growth in these cells. To determine whether NF1 gene expression is similarly altered in pheochromocytomas from patients without NF1, we examined 20 pheochromocytomas for the presence of NF1 RNA and neurofibromin by reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Reduced or absent NF1 gene expression was documented in 7 of these 20 tumors (35%) including 1 of 4 sporadic tumors, 3 of 10 tumors from patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, 2 of 4 tumors from patients with MEN2B, and 1 of 2 tumors from patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. In addition, most of these tumors expressed predominantly the type 1 NF1 isoform (75% type 1 NF1 isoform expression) as opposed to other neural crest-derived tissues such as adrenal gland and Schwann cells, which express predominantly type 2 NF1. This type 1 isoform predominance was also observed in the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line, suggesting that this change in isoform expression may be associated with the genesis of these tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Loss of neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) gene expression in pheochromocytomas from patients without NF1.","pubmedId":"7542904"}
