Several studies have suggested that genes other than NPM may be fused to the ALK gene. Here we have identified TRK-fused gene (TFG) as a new ALK partner in 2 ALCL, 1 of which exhibited a t(2;3)(p23;q21). In these cases, TFG was involved in 2 different fusion genes, TFG-ALK(S) and TFG-ALK(L), coding respectively 85-kD and 97-kD chimeric proteins. The ALK breakpoint in these translocations was the same as in the classic t(2;5) translocation. These 2 proteins were both active in an in vitro tyrosine kinase assay showing that the new cloned cDNA sequences are translated into chimeric proteins with functional activity. These findings indicate that TFG can provide an alternative to NPM as a fusion partner responsible for activation of the ALK and the pathogenesis of ALCL.","title":"TRK-fused gene (TFG) is a new partner of ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma producing two structurally different TFG-ALK translocations.","pubmedId":"10556217"}
