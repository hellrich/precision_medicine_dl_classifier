In thyroid carcinomas, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression was found increased in differentiated, poorly differentiated, medullary and anaplastic variants. Hypoxia represents the principal stimulus responsible for hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha induction. Other nonhypoxic stimuli increase hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha synthesis through the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in a cell-type-specific manner. We have previously shown the role of BRAF(V600E) mutation in papillary thyroid cancer cells as a factor that facilitates tumor cell growth and progression. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that BRAF(V600E) mutation influences hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells. We analyzed 27 papillary thyroid carcinomas, 13 of which presented BRAF(V600E) mutation. In tumor tissues, immunoreactivity for hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha was detected in the majority of analyzed BRAF(V600E) mutated cases. Transcriptional analyses revealed elevated hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha levels with significant differences between wild-type and mutated group. A BRAF wild-type papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line and a BRAF(V600E) mutated papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line were selected to study the effects of BRAF mutation on hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression in vitro. Knockdown of mutant BRAF(V600E) or both the wild type and the BRAF(V600E) by RNA interference induced a significant reduction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression at mRNA and protein levels. Pharmacological inhibition of BRAF significantly reduces hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression levels in papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line harboring BRAF(V600E) mutation. Our results suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha is expressed in papillary thyroid carcinomas and is regulated not only by hypoxia but also by BRAF(V600E)-mediated signaling pathway.","title":"BRAF(V600E) mutation influences hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression levels in papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"20473281"}
