The breakpoint sites on chromosome 22 are clustered in a limited region known as the major breakpoint cluster region (Mbcr). This region is approximately 5.8 Kb long and can be arbitrarily subdivided into five zones (1 through 5 from the 5\u0027 towards the 3\u0027 end) as defined by the particular sites of three restriction endonucleases. Using Southern blot analysis with two DNA probes, one spanning both the 5\u0027 and 3\u0027 regions of the Mbcr while the other only the 3\u0027 region, we mapped the precise location of the chromosomal breakpoints within the Mbcr in 62 patients with CGL and examined possible clinical correlations. There were 39 patients with 5\u0027 breakpoints (zones 1-3) and 23 patients with 3\u0027 breakpoints (zones 4 and 5). We found no correlation between the clinical phase of the disease at last followup and breakpoint distributions. The distributions of chronic phase duration (CPD) and survival were similar between patients with 5\u0027 breakpoints (median CPD \u003d 4.0 years) and those with 3\u0027 breakpoints (median CPD \u003d 5.2 years). Presenting clinical features and the rates of lymphoblastic transformation were also similar among the subgroups. Our data suggest that the precise location of the breakpoint within the Mbcr in CGL may not have clinical relevance.","title":"The location of the Philadelphia chromosomal breakpoint site and prognosis in chronic granulocytic leukemia.","pubmedId":"2173804"}
