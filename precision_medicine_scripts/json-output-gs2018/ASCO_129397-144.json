Compared to those in the general population, even after accounting for smoking, HIV(+)s have a 2.55-fold higher risk of LCa, and are diagnosed younger. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated survival improvements with low dose CT (LD-CT) screening in persons at high lung cancer risk (age 55-74 with 30 pack-years [pys] of smoking). We examined the age and smoking histories of HIV+ LCa patients to determine who would have met NLST screening eligibility.  Methods:  The Cancer Registry (42,967 cancer cases) and the HIV Integrated Clinical Database (14,927 HIV+s) at Montefiore Medical Center  Einstein (Bronx, NY) were linked to identify HIV+ cancer cases between 2000-2012. Chart review was performed for those with LCa.  Results:  Of the 935 invasive cancers in HIV+s, 90 (9.6%) were LCa (62% men, 38% women). Histology was 11% small cell, 20% squamous and 37% adenocarcinoma, 2% large cell, and remaining 30% were classified as non-small cell carcinomas. Median age at LCa diagnosis was 54 years ([y]; range: 2472), with 2% \u003c35y, 52% 35-54y, 46% 55y. 4% were never smokers, and 3% had \u003c15pys, 24% 15-29pys, 68% 30pys. Overall, 66 cases (73%) did not meet NLST age or smoking criteria. Most cases (85%) had been followed for HIV care. The median CD4+ was 238 cells/L, and median HIV viral load was 81 copies/mL. LCa was stage I in 8%, stage II in 11%, stage III in 23%, and stage IV in 58%. All stage I/II cases underwent surgical resection.  Conclusions:  Most HIV+ LCa cases failed to meet NLST criteria for LD-CT screening due to age \u003c55y or pys \u003c30. If LD-CT is to be utilized in this high-risk population, age and smoking thresholds may need to be lowered. Notably, 19% of tumors were diagnosed at stage I/II without routine screening, reinforcing the potential to identify LCa at a treatable stage in HIV(+) persons.","title":"Characteristics of HIV+ lung cancer cases in a large clinical population: Implications for lung cancer screening.","pubmedId":"ASCO_129397-144"}
