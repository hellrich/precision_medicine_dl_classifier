It is unique among the NHL of intermediate grade because there is no evidence of a curable subset of patients. To investigate whether any laboratory data might predict outcome, we studied 33 cases collected during a 12-year period and correlated morphology, immunohistochemistry, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with clinical data and outcome.\nWe found that proliferative rate (Ki-67), cell lineage (T v B cell), and serum LDH were associated with significant differences in survival. A Ki-67 value greater than or equal to 20% was associated with a median survival of 20 months compared with 80 months for lower values (P \u003d .0002); patients with tumors of T-cell lineage had a median survival of 20 months compared with 40 months for those with B-cell neoplasms (P \u003d .0143); and a serum LDH greater than 225 IU/L was associated with a median survival of 8 months compared with 40 months for lower LDH levels (P \u003d .0004). Blastoid morphology was also linked to a trend toward poor outcome (P \u003d .08). Neither a history of low-grade lymphoma nor the presence of residual immunologically detectable follicles influenced outcome (P \u003d .93 and .97, respectively).\nWe conclude that high Ki-67, high LDH, and T-cell lineage each identify DSCL patients with poor outcome.","title":"Diffuse small cleaved-cell lymphoma: a heterogeneous disease with distinct immunobiologic subsets.","pubmedId":"1634915"}
