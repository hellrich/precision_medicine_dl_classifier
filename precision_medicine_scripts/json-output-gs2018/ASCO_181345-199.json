As Malignant Melanoma (MM) is associated with high mutation rates, and we postulated that mm is likely to have abnormal DNA repair pathway aberrations that could have prognostic and/or therapeutic significance. Methods: We conducted an unbiased assessment of genes involved in the DNA damage response through a comprehensive survey of established public data repositories and published literature and abstracts in all cancers. This survey was used to generate a 6-gene DNA Damage Signature (DDS). The DDS was then applied to 287 mm samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Results: The DDS was altered in 25% (72/287) of patients with mutations being present in all 6 genes including ATM (6%), TP53BP1 (7%), MDC1 (7%), BRCA1 (5%), PRKDC (8%) and RAD50 (1.4%). The DDS was more commonly altered in mm harboring alterations in BRAF (78%, 112/143), NRAS (89%, 73/82) or NF1 (75%, 5/20) than in triple wild type tumors (60%,19/32). The correlation between alteration in BRAF/NRAS/NF1 and DDS (p \u003d 0.02) reached significance, as did the tendency for DDS and NF1 altered subtype to co-occur (p \u003c 0.05). Importantly, alteration in the DDS was associated with significantly longer disease free (88 vs. 44 months, p \u003d 0.02) and overall survival (152 vs. 66 months, P \u003d 0.02). The mutations in ATM and BRCA1, shown to be targets in other cancers for PARP inhibition were seen in these patients as well as other oncogenic or hot-spot mutations. Conclusions: The improved survival associated with alteration of the DDS implicate DNA damage response signaling as favorably modulating the immune system, and propose a possible role for PARP inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in melanoma.","title":"Mutation of the DNA damage gene signature to predict for better outcome in malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_181345-199"}
