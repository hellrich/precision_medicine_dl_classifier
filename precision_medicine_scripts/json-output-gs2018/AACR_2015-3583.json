ALK-positive tumors are currently treated with crizotinib (XalkoriTM, Pfizer) or ceritinib (ZykadiaTM, Novartis), two oral ALK inhibitors (ALKi). Additional inhibitors are in clinical trial. Despite high response rates, drug-resistant disease often develops in patients. In order to study the mechanisms that underlie resistance, we generated several ALKi-resistant cell lines in vitro. Here we present the selection of novel NPM/ALK-positive ALCL cells resistant to ASP3026 (Astellas) that grow in the presence of up to 2 M ASP3026 and show 10 to 60 fold shift in IC50. The established ASP3026-resistant cell lines carry several point mutations in the ALK kinase domain (G1128S, C1156F, I1171N/T, F1174I, N1178H, E1210K, and C1156F/D1203N) that confer resistance to ASP3026 when reintroduced in a Ba/F3 cell model. Furthermore, the activity profile of ASP3026, crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, AP26113 and PF-06463922 against a panel of 20 NPM/ALK drug-resistant mutants will be presented. We report for each ALKi the IC50 value against the mutants, the IC50 fold increase over wild-type NPM/ALK (relative resistance, RR) and the IC50 ratio between parental Ba/F3 cells and mutants (therapeutic index, TI). From our screen, the G1202R and C1156F/D1203N mutations appear to be highly resistant to all tested inhibitors, therefore they are predicted to be the most challenging mutants for ALKi therapy.","title":"Drug-resistant NPM/ALK mutants show different sensitivity to second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-3583"}
