Imaging, though not diagnostic in many cases, helps in selecting the appropriate treatment strategy by determining the anatomic extent of the tumor and locoregional and distant spread. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the imaging features of these uncommon esophageal malignancies. ","title":"Imaging of uncommon esophageal malignancies.","pubmedId":"24635682"}
