Diagnosing these sarcomas can be difficult owing to their resemblance to Ewing sarcoma and other \u0027small round blue cell tumors\u0027; molecular techniques are generally required. Recent gene expression studies of CIC-rearranged sarcomas identified the upregulation of ETV4. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of ETV4 and WT1 immunohistochemistry for CIC-rearranged sarcoma. We evaluated whole-tissue sections from 40 CIC-rearranged sarcomas, 40 Ewing sarcomas, 4 BCOR-CCNB3 sarcomas, 6 unclassified round cell sarcomas, and 150 histologic mimics. Moderate-to-strong nuclear immunoreactivity for ETV4 in at least 50% of cells was observed in 36 (90%) CIC-rearranged sarcomas and 10 (5%) other tumors, including 5 unclassified round cell sarcomas, 2 Wilms tumors, and 1 each desmoplastic small round cell tumor, melanoma, and small cell carcinoma. Thirty-eight (95%) CIC-rearranged sarcomas showed nuclear staining for WT1, and 34 (85%) were positive for both ETV4 and WT1. Of 182 other tumors evaluated, 34 (19%) showed nuclear WT1 positivity, including all Wilms tumors and desmoplastic small round cell tumors, 5 unclassified round cell sarcomas, and a subset of lymphoblastic lymphomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, mesenchymal chondrosarcomas, carcinomas, and melanomas. In summary, diffuse moderate-to-strong ETV4 expression is present in most CIC-rearranged sarcomas and unclassified round cell sarcomas. More limited expression is seen in small subsets of various other round cell neoplasms. Nuclear WT1 expression is also present in most CIC-rearranged sarcomas and unclassified round cell sarcomas, along with Wilms tumors and desmoplastic small round cell tumors, and subsets of various histologic mimics. The sensitivity and specificity of diffuse ETV4 expression for CIC-rearranged sarcomas are 90% and 95%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of WT1 are 95% and 81%, respectively. Diffuse ETV4 along with at least focal WT1 expression is helpful to distinguish CIC-rearranged sarcoma from Ewing sarcoma and other histologic mimics.","title":"Evaluation of ETV4 and WT1 expression in CIC-rearranged sarcomas and histologic mimics.","pubmedId":"27443513"}
