Immunopositivity of C-KIT was common in adenoid cystic carcinoma (92%). Lack of C-KIT expression occurred in salivary duct carcinoma (P \u003c 0.001) and was associated with high-grade tumours (P \u003d 0.002), positive lymph nodes (P \u003d 0.002) and high expression of Ki67 (P \u003d 0.001). HER2 was typically expressed in salivary duct carcinomas (83%), but was not associated with any other parameter. EGFR overexpression occurred independently of histological type and clinical parameters. On univariate survival analysis, overexpression of EGFR (P \u003d 0.011) and lack of C-KIT (P \u003d 0.014) were associated with worse prognosis, whereas HER2 was of no prognostic significance. On multivariate analysis, the strongest negative predictor of survival was high proliferative activity measured by Ki67 (P \u003d 0.002), followed by presence of residual tumour (P \u003d 0.006), overexpression of EGFR (P \u003d 0.026) and advanced tumour stage (P \u003d 0.041).\nThe expression of receptor tyrosine kinases confers additional prognostic impact on disease-specific survival. EGFR overexpression is an independent negative prognostic factor.","title":"Overexpression of EGFR and absence of C-KIT expression correlate with poor prognosis in salivary gland carcinomas.","pubmedId":"18983466"}
