The reciprocal interaction between Trk and p75NTR signaling pathways can dictate cellular responses to neurotrophins. p75NTR can regulate Trk-dependent responses, but the role of Trk in regulating p75NTR-dependent signaling is not well documented.\nUsing real-time polymerase chain reaction, this study analyzed changes in the mRNA abundance of the mentioned genes at 6, 24, and 72 hours and 7 and 10 days after SCI in adult male rats. SCI was induced at T9 level by transsection.\nResults show a complicated temporal and spatial pattern of alteration with different degrees and direction (up- or down-regulation) in p75NTR, Trk A, and caspase-9 mRNA expression levels after SCI. The greatest variation was seen in center regions following SCI. This study shows that alteration in p75NTR, Trk A, and caspase-9 expression starts as early as 6 hours after SCI. Alterations in p75NTR, Trk A, and caspase-9 expression within the spinal cord may play a key role in the apoptotic cell death.\nResults suggest that the role of p75NTR is to eliminate damaged cells by activating the apoptotic machinery, especially at the center of damage and during first week after injury.","title":"Messenger RNA expression patterns of p75 neurotrophin receptor and tropomyosin-receptor-kinase A following spinal cord injury.","pubmedId":"23809594"}
