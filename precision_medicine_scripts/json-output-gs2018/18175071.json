The complex biological program triggered by Met has been dissected and its biological relevance in both physiology and pathology has been proven. Met supports a morphogenetic program, known as invasive growth, taking place both during embryogenesis and adulthood. In tumors Met is often aberrantly activated, giving rise to the pathological counterpart of the invasive growth program: cancer progression towards metastasis. Several approaches have been recently developed to interfere with the tumorigenic and metastatic processes triggered by Met.","title":"The Met tyrosine kinase receptor in development and cancer.","pubmedId":"18175071"}
