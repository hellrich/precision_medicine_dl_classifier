Deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) can be produced by the de novo pathway (DNP) via ribonucleotide reductase, and/or by the nucleoside salvage pathway (NSP) via deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). The NSP\u0027s role in supporting tumor DNA replication is unknown. Here we show that survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells upon inhibition of DNP-dependent dCTP production requires a functional NSP. Thus, DNP inhibition triggers a compensatory switch to NSP-mediated dCTP production. This metabolic switch can be imaged by positron emission tomography, thereby providing a non-invasive method for monitoring pharmacological targeting of the DNP. Blocking both DNP dCTP production using thymidine and the switch to NSP using a new dCK inhibitor induces replication stress overload and synthetic lethality in leukemia cells, without significant host toxicity. This co-targeting therapy may be broadly applicable against other malignancies characterized by high levels of replication stress.","title":"Co-targeting of convergent, switchable nucleotide biosynthetic pathways induces synthetic lethality in leukemia","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-5097"}
