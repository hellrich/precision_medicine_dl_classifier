The management of recurrent ovarian cancer has been individualized: surgical resection of intraabdominal and/or pelvic disease has been performed when technically feasible and usually followed with chemotherapy.\nThis case describes aggressive surgical management of recurrent ovarian cancer metastatic to the lower ribs, sternum, and diaphragm. A clear cell, Stage IIIA ovarian cancer was successfully resected in a 73-year-old female. The patient had total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy followed by six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, consisting of cyclophospamide and carboplatinum. A period of 8 years elapsed before recurrent disease was detected; there were two separate metastatic sites. A secondary cytoreductive surgery without further chemotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment. A combination of exploratory laparotomy and en bloc resection revealed the metastatic deposits, a 5-cm mass involving the diaphragm, the lower aspect of the manubrium sternum, and four right lower ribs. The second deposit was identified in the left paracolic gutter invading the sigmoid colon.\nAt 47 months of follow-up, the patient is alive and without any evidence of measurable disease by exam and confirmed by CT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis. To our knowledge, this is one of the few reported cases managed successfully by surgical approach and is recommended in selected patients with metastatic ovarian cancer.","title":"A case report of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer metastatic to the sternum, diaphragm, costae, and bowel managed by aggressive secondary cytoreductive surgery without postoperative chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"12079306"}
