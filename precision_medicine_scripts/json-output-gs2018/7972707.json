Because a multimodal treatment approach is currently used, proper tumor staging is essential to determine whether therapy should be directed toward cure or palliation. Important prognostic features of squamous cell carcinoma include the depth of tumor infiltration into or through the esophageal wall and the presence of distant metastases. Imaging strategies should not be limited to visualization of the tumor but also should be directed toward accurate pretreatment staging. In this article, the authors review the use of barium swallow, CT scans, and endoscopic ultrasonography both alone and in combination to visualize and stage esophageal carcinoma. The strengths and limitations of each modality are also discussed.","title":"Esophageal squamous carcinoma.","pubmedId":"7972707"}
