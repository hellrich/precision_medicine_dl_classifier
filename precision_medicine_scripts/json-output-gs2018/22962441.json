FDA analyzed the results of two single-arm trials, enrolling 102 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and 58 patients with sALCL. Both trials had primary endpoints of objective response rate (ORR) and key secondary endpoints of response duration and complete response (CR) rate. For patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, ORR was 73% (95% CI, 65-83%); median response duration was 6.7 months, and CR was 32% (95% CI, 23-42%). For patients with sALCL, ORR was 86% (95% CI, 77-95%), median response duration was 12.6 months, and CR was 57% (95% CI, 44-70%). The most common adverse reactions were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, anemia, upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, pyrexia, rash, thrombocytopenia, cough, and vomiting. FDA granted accelerated approval of brentuximab vedotin for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or after failure of at least two prior multiagent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not ASCT candidates, and for the treatment of patients with sALCL after failure of at least one prior multiagent chemotherapy regimen.","title":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval summary: brentuximab vedotin for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"22962441"}
