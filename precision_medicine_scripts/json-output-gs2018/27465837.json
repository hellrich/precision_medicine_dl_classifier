The meta-analysis examined the correlation between c-MET IHC expression and clinicopathological parameters. We investigated concordance rate between c-MET IHC and genetic alteration and performed subgroup analysis based on c-MET IHC cut-off value.\nThe estimated positive rate of c-MET IHC was 0.440 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.355-0.529). The positive rate of c-MET IHC was significantly high in non-squamous cell carcinomas and tumors with stage III-IV. However, there was no significant difference between c-MET IHC positivity and sex, smoking, and lymph node metastasis. The c-MET IHC positivity was significantly correlated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio 1.551, 95% CI 1.101-2.184). In c-MET IHC-positive and negative groups, the concordance rate was 0.941 (95% CI 0.885-0.971) and 0.300 (95% CI 0.196-0.429), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the high cut-off subgroup for c-MET IHC was 1.00 (95% CI 0.92-1.00) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.75-0.81), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio and the area under curve on summary receiver operating characteristic curve were 76.56 (95% CI 8.23-712.41) and 0.9949, respectively.\nThe c-MET IHC could be useful for screening of c-MET genetic alteration in NSCLC patients. Detailed criteria for c-MET IHC evaluation are necessary to determine how to best apply this approach in daily practice.","title":"Clinicopathological significance and concordance analysis of c-MET immunohistochemistry in non-small cell lung cancers: A meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"27465837"}
