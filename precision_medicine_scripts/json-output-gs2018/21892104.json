Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) frequently show aberrant WWOX expression. Herein, we characterized WWOX at a functional level in preclinical NSCLC models and in primary NSCLC biopsies.\nThe human wild-type (wt) WWOX complementary DNA and a mutant WWOX with structurally disrupted short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase domain were conditionally expressed at physiological levels in several human NSCLC models. Resulting transgenic cell populations were analyzed with respect to clonogenic survival and apoptosis sensitivity in vitro and tumor growth in immune-deficient mice. Tissue microarrays prepared from surgically resected primary human NSCLC tumors were studied to correlate intratumoral WWOX expression with patient outcomes.\nConditional expression of wt WWOX, but not mutant WWOX, suppressed clonogenic survival of NSCLC cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. In addition, preserved intratumoral WWOX expression was associated with improved outcome in a cohort of 85 patients with surgically resected NSCLC. Unexpectedly, wt WWOX failed to sensitize NSCLC cells to various apoptotic stimuli but robustly protected against apoptosis induced by inhibitors of growth factor signal transduction.\nWWOX acts as a tumor suppressor in human NSCLC models in a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase domain-dependent manner. This activity is independent of sensitization to apoptotic cell death. WWOX expression as detected by immunohistochemistry may be a prognostic biomarker in surgically resected, early-stage NSCLC.","title":"Functional and clinical characterization of the putative tumor suppressor WWOX in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21892104"}
