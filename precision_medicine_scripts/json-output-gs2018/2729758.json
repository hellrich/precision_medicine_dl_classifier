Extensive clinical and postmortem examinations are necessary to exclude the possibility that the lung tumor does not represent a metastasis from an occult cutaneous or extracutaneous melanoma. We present a case of a 62-yr-old man who appears to have had a primary melanoma of the left upper lobe of the lung. The literature on primary pulmonary melanoma is also reviewed.","title":"Primary malignant melanoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"2729758"}
