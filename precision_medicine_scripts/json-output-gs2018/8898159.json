Depth and lateral extent of stromal invasion were verified using an ocular micrometer. Cell type and lymph vascular space invasion (LVSI) were recorded in each case. Patients were treated primarily by radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy, and those with lymph node metastases were offered postoperative radiation. Following treatment, patients were seen at 3-month intervals for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter. The mean duration of follow-up was 6.9 years (range 0.4-23.5 years). Seven of 94 patients (7.4%) had lymph node metastases. Five patients had 1 positive node, 1 patient had 2 positive nodes, and 1 patient had 3 positive nodes. Five patients developed recurrent cancer and 4 died of disease. LVSI was present in 31 cases (33%). Tumor recurrence was significantly increased in patients with positive LVSI (9.7% vs 3.2%). The 5-year survival rate of patients with LVSI was 89% vs 98% in patients without this finding (P \u003d 0.058). The 5-year survival rate of all Stage IA2 cervical cancer patients was 95%. Patients with Stage IA2 cervical cancer have a significant risk of lymph node metastases and should be treated by radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy. LVSI is an important prognostic variable in these patients and should be recorded in all cases.","title":"Lymph node metastases and prognosis in patients with stage IA2 cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"8898159"}
