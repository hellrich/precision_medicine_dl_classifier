The ongoing therapies in ALK+ ALCL, based on aggressive chemotherapy, are not optimal. One compound so far, the crizotinib, is used in clinics for the treatment of ALK-dependent lung cancers. However, the first mutations conferring resistance to crizotinib, have been reported and hampered its use for the treatment of ALK+ ALCL. Thus, despite the therapeutic success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer treatments, acquired drug resistances universally develop. In this context, cytoprotective autophagy has been proposed as the next target for elimination of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We recently demonstrated that cytoprotective autophagy is indeed activated shortly upon ALK inactivation in ALCL and that its inhibition enhances the anti-tumoral action of Crizotinib. A transcriptome analysis showed an increased expression of many genes from the autophagy machinery such as ULK1, MAP1LC3B, or ATG16L2 after crizotinib treatment in ALCL. Moreover, new preliminary results enabled us to identify a set of miRNAs differentially expressed in ALCL upon Crizotinib treatment. As miRNAs are known as fine regulators of gene expression, we anticipate that some of them could be efficient regulators of core autophagy genes expression. The aim of our study is to select a few miRNAs of interest and to confirm their regulatory role on the autophagic machinery. This could lead to the development of new therapeutical strategies which could ultimately help to overcome emerging resistances against crizotinib.","title":"Insight into microRNA regulation of autophagy genes expression in crizotinib-treated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-195"}
