The incidence of cutaneous melanoma is known to be linked to UV peak exposure, and the N-ras oncogene is clearly one of the genes involved in the UV carcinogenesis in melanoma. It is mutated in a significant proportion of melanomas and therefore may serve as a target for T cells. Here, we report that an human leukocyte antigen-A2 binding peptide CLLDILDTAGL, encompassing the frequently found 61-Leu mutation in N-ras, induces cytotoxic T lymphocytes from healthy donor blood that lyse 61-Leu N-ras transfected melanoma cells. Furthermore, we have found an association between the presence of N-ras mutations and clinical response to immunotherapy with interleukin-2 plus interferon in a group of stage IV melanoma patients. Although the overall survival of these patients was not affected by the N-ras status of their melanomas, these studies suggest that mutated N-ras may provide a target for cytotoxic T lymphocytes in melanoma patients.","title":"UV-induced N-ras mutations are T-cell targets in human melanoma.","pubmedId":"9578425"}
