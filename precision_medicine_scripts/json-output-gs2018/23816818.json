In this report, we describe an APL patient who had received standard induction/maintenance therapy resulting in durable remission for 4.5 years, when he presented with a unilateral testicular mass confirmed as myeloid sarcoma; this was followed by systemic relapse of APL. Retrospective analysis of the involved blood and bone marrow samples at the time of the initial diagnosis revealed a rare point mutation of FLT3-TKD and a novel mutation of WT1. These mutations were detected recurrently throughout the course of the disease. After reinduction therapy with arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid combined with daunorubicin, complete hematological remission was achieved for the ensuing salvage allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
