This report shows that transgenic mice with thyroid-targeted expression of the ret/PTC1 oncogene developed thyroid carcinomas with considerable similarities to human papillary thyroid carcinomas, particularly in the nuclear cytologic features and the presence of local invasion. Our findings indicate that ret/PTC2 is not only a biomarker associated with papillary thyroid carcinomas, but is also the only proven specific genetic event leading to the development of papillary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"Targeted expression of the ret/PTC1 oncogene induces papillary thyroid carcinomas.","pubmedId":"8536638"}
