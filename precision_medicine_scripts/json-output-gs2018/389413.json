The latter two patients developed the hematologic picture of AML less than eight months later. In all cases, AML was confirmed by cytochemical studies of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. Autopsy of two of the patients revealed only AML. The myeloid nature of the proliferative cells was demonstrated with the naphthol-ASD-chloroacetate stain (NCA) on postmortem tissue sections. This study further supports the hypothesis of a common origin of neoplastic lymphoid and myeloid cells from pluripotent bone marrow stem cells.","title":"Acute myeloblastic leukemia developing in patients with mediastinal lymphoblastic lymphoma.","pubmedId":"389413"}
