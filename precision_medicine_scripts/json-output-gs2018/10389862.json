Expression of the ret/PTC oncogene was examined immunohistochemically to address its role in the progression of thyroid carcinomas.\nParaffin-embedded samples from 34 clinically evident thyroid papillary carcinomas and 19 occult papillary carcinomas were analyzed using an antibody raised against the ret tyrosine kinase domain.\nExpression of ret/PTC was demonstrated in 6/19 (32%) occult carcinomas. The frequency of expression of ret/PTC in clinically evident carcinomas in 16/34 (47%) was significantly higher than in normal tissues (0%) and follicular adenomas (1/14, 7%, P \u003c 0.01).ret/PTC expression was observed more frequently in the peripheral areas of clinically evident carcinomas (P \u003c 0.01). Although there was no correlation of ret/PTC expression with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis, the incidence of ret/PTC expression in tumors with extrathyroidal invasion (13/19, 68%) was significantly higher than those without extrathyroidal invasion (3/15, 20%, P \u003c 0.01). Local invasion was found in none of the occult carcinomas. The frequency of expression in occult carcinomas was significantly lower than in clinically evident carcinomas with extrathyroidal invasion (P \u003c 0.05).\nThe ret/PTC oncogene may be involved in the local invasion of thyroid papillary carcinomas.","title":"ret/PTC expression may be associated with local invasion of thyroid papillary carcinoma.","pubmedId":"10389862"}
