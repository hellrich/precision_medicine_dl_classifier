Aberrant expression of cdk6 protein has been observed in many cancer types. However, little is known about the expression of cdk6 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and its clinical significance. This study evaluated the expression of cdk6 in HNSCC and analyzed the relationship between cdk6 expression and clinicopathological parameters of HNSCC.\nExpression of cdk6 was immunohistochemically investigated in 98 HNSCCs. Nuclear and cytoplasmic positive cells were counted separately. Data were presented as the percentage of positive cells. The correlation between the percentage of positive cells and clinicopathological factors was determined.\nNuclear and cytoplasmic staining for cdk6 were detected in 91 cases and 97 cases, respectively. A significant correlation was found only between the percentage of nuclear positive cells and T classification (p value \u003d 0.0410). Tumors with high nuclear cdk6-positive cells showed a linear trend toward advanced tumor status (p value \u003d 0.0064).\nCdk6 was highly expressed in HNSCC. Tumors with high nuclear cdk6 expression tended to have advanced tumor status. These results suggest that cdk6 plays a vital role in HNSCC and is involved in tumor progression of this cancer.\nAn increased nuclear cdk6 expression is an unfavorable factor for HNSCC. Cdk6 may serve as a therapeutic target in this cancer.","title":"Expression of cdk6 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25929813"}
