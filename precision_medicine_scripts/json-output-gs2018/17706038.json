Sixty patients were treated by tumor resection and (or) chemotherapy and (or) radiation. Fourteen out of the 60 patients received another autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.\nOf the 63 patients with advanced neuroblastoma, the male/female ratio was 2.7:1 and the median age at diagnosis was 4 years old. Most of the initial symptoms included pyrexia, abdominal pain, abdominal mass, and leg or articular pain. Primary tumor sites were adrenal (38%), retroperitoneal (35%), mediastinal (17%), pelvic (6%) and cervical (2%). The sites of metastasis at diagnosis included local (41%) and (or) distant (37%) lymph nodes, bone marrow (60%), bone (46%) and liver (16%). The median survival time of the 63 patients was 32.7 months. The 2-year survival rate was 44.3%. Statistical analysis demonstrated that unfavorable survival prognostic factors were the following: age \u003e 1 year at diagnosis (P \u003c 0.05); serum neuro-specific enolase \u003e 100 mg/L (P \u003c 0.05); serum lactic dehydrogenase \u003e 1500 U/L (P \u003c 0.01); serum ferritin \u003e150 mg/L (P \u003c 0.05). The overall survival period of the patients was prolonged through total resection of the primary tumor (P \u003c 0.05). Intensive chemotherapy in combination with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation could also result in a prolonged overall survival period (P \u003c 0.01).\nNeuroblastoma with advanced stages often presents with various clinical manifestations and has a poor prognosis. It is beneficial to improve the prognosis of neuroblastoma through an early diagnosis and a comprehensive therapy including total resection of the primary tumor, autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and intensive chemotherapy.","title":"[Clinical features and prognosis of advanced neuroblastoma in children].","pubmedId":"17706038"}
