With the rapid advance of cancer research, redox regulation has drawn more and more attentions. The superoxide dismutases SOD1 and SOD2 are essential enzymes for eliminating ROS. To date, SOD1 or SOD2 have not been well characterized in non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC). Here we compared the expression of SOD proteins between normal and cancer tissues and investigated its prognostic significance in NSCLC patients.Method: we detected the expression of SOD1 and SOD2 in 178 NSCLC samples by immunohistochemistry and their clinical significances were analyzed. Western blotting is used to confirm the protein level of SOD1 and SOD2 in the normal and cancer tissues of NSCLC patients.Results: The expression of SOD1 and SOD2 is significantly higher in bothadenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (p\u003c0.0001), compared to matched adjacent normal tissues. Correlation analysis indicates that SOD1 expression is reversely associated with TNM stage, and SOD2 is negatively correlated with tumor size, tumor number and TNM stage remarkably (all p \u003c0.05). Moreover, higher expression of SOD1 and SOD2 is correlated with better prognosis of NSCLC patients. Finally, Univariate and multivariate Cox regression modes further indicate that SOD1 and SOD2 can be used as independent prognostic factors in NSCLC patients.Conclusion: Higher expressions of SOD1 and SOD2 in NSCLC tissues are observed compared to adjacent tissues and indicate better prognosis, suggesting that SOD proteins are potentially useful biomarkers for prognostic evaluation of patients with NSCLC.Key Words: Reactive oxygen species; Non-small cell lung cancer; Superoxide dismutase 1/2; Prognosis.","title":"Identification of sod and sod2 as potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-5541"}
