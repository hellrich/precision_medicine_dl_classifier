The aim of the current study was to evaluate the expression of c-erbB-2, EGF and EGFR in advanced gastric carcinoma and to analyze its relationship with chosen anatomo-clinical parameters and prognosis. Standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase was used for c-erbB-2, EGF and EGFR immuno-histochemical staining (Novostain Super ABC Kit Universal); anti-human c-erbB-2 protein monoclonal antibody NCL-cerbB-2-316, anti-Epidermal Growth Factor monoclonal antibody (clone EGF-10) and EGFR goat polyclonal IgG (p-EGFR). A statistically significant correlation was found between c-erbB-2, EGF, EGRF expressions in the main mass of tumor and lymph node metastasis (p\u003d0.000; p\u003d0.000; p\u003d0.00001, respectively). Also an association was observed between c-erbB-2 expression and Bormann\u0027s and Lauren\u0027s classifications (p\u003d0.05; p\u003d0.006, respectively). Similarly, the expression of EGFR in main mass of tumor was correlated with the depth of invasion (p\u003d0.007) and histological differentiation (p\u003d0.04). Moreover, the expression of c-erbB-2 in the main mass of tumor and lymph node metastasis was associated with the age of the patients (p\u003d0.03; p\u003d0.0002 respectively). Strong association was found between the expression of EGRF in lymph node metastasis and histological differentiation (p\u003d0.04). Positive expression of c-erbB-2 in lymph node metastasis was correlated with lymph node involvement (p\u003d0.04). Positive expression of c-erbB-2 in the main mass of tumor and in lymph node metastasis was strongly correlated with postoperative survival (p\u003d0.00001; p\u003d0.003 respectively). We also found a relationship between EGF expression in gastric tumor and survival time (p\u003d0.003). No association was noted between the expression of EGFR in the main mass of tumor and in lymph node metastasis and between the expression of EGF in lymph node metastasis and survival time. Our results suggest that the expression of c-erbB-2 and EGF protein can help predict the postoperative survival time.","title":"Correlation of c-erbB-2, EGF and EGFR expression with postoperative survival of patients with advanced carcinoma of the stomach.","pubmedId":"20430735"}
