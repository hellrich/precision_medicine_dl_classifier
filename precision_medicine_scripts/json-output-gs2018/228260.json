No statistically significant difference was noted in the AVP, neurophysins and osmolality values between 10 patients with asymptomatic oat cell carcinoma and control population (10 normal volunteers, 12 patients with non neoplasic lung pathology and 10 patients with different lung carcinoma). We concluded that AVP and neurophysins cannot be considered as a good tumoral marker in the detection of oat cell carcinoma of the lung.","title":"[Systematic evaluation of 8 arginine vasopressin and neurophysins plasma levels in 10 patients with oat cells carcinoma of the lung (author\u0027s transl)].","pubmedId":"228260"}
