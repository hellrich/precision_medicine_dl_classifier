Although specific karyotypic abnormalities have been found to link to MDS for decades, more recent findings have demonstrated the importance of mutations within individual genes. The recent molecular abnormalities found in MDS include following gene mutation such as TET2, TP53, RUNX1, ASXL1, IDH1/IDH2, EZH2 and RAS. In this review, the recent advances of prognostic molecular markers of MDS and their biological and clinical significance are summarized.","title":"[Recent advances of molecular mechanisms influencing prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome - review].","pubmedId":"22931676"}
