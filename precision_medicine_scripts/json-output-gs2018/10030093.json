Forty nine percent of tumors had positive staining for RE, 41% for RPG, 45% for p53 and 57% for c-erb-B2. Correlation was found between histological grade and expression of RE, p53 and c-erb-B2 between RE and PGR, RE and c-erb-B2 and between c-erb-B2 and p5. RE expression correlated with age.\nA reliable and rapid evaluation of these markers can be achieved using immunohistochemical staining. The present results are similar to other biochemical and immunohistochemical studies.","title":"[Immunohistochemical tumor markers in infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma].","pubmedId":"10030093"}
