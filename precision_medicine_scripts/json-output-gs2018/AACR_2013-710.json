The cells are mostly in G0/G1 phase, as imaged by fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). However, most cytotoxic agents target only proliferating cancer cells. The telomerase-specific adenovirus, OBP-301 was injected into the peritoneal cavity 7 days after inoculation of FUCCI-expressing MKN45. Control mice had approximately 5 ml bloody ascites with big tumor masses in the peritoneal cavity after 60 days. Cisplatin-treated mice also had approximately 5 ml bloody ascites with a big tumor masses in the peritoneal cavity. Paclitaxel-treated mice also had big tumor masses. There were many tumor spheres in the bloody ascites, and the tumors in the peritoneal cavity consisted of cancer cells mostly in G0/G1 phase. In contrast, OBP-301 treated mice had no ascites and only small tumor nodules consisting of cancer cells in S/G2 phases in the peritoneal cavity. These data suggest that OBP-301 is effective against peritonially disseminated cancer cells which are mostly in G0/G1.","title":"Telomerase-specific oncolytic adenovirus OBP-301 kills quiescent peritonially disseminated cancer cells.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-710"}
