We present the case of an indeterminate BRAF-positive FNA that showed no evidence of cancer on final surgical pathology.\nCase report and literature review.\nAn 87-year-old female with an indeterminate 1.7-cm nodule but BRAF-positive cytology underwent thyroid lobectomy. Final pathology revealed a benign adenomatoid nodule. An area rich in tumor cells from the nodule was identified, labeled, and microdissected for molecular testing, which demonstrated only wild-type BRAF, at the analytical limit of the assay.\nIncreasingly sensitive BRAF assays using dual-priming oligonucleotide-based multiplex polymerase chain reaction analysis can detect the BRAF V600E mutation when present in only 2% of a population of wild-type cells. This increases the risk of false-positive results, particularly in cases of indeterminate FNA. Clinicians must caution patients in these circumstances that BRAF molecular testing may not have a 100% positive predictive value.","title":"False-positive FNA due to highly sensitive BRAF assay.","pubmedId":"24014015"}
