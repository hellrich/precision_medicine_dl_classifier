Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available, highly potent and selective ATP-competitive pan-Trk, ROS1 and ALK inhibitor. In preclinical studies, entrectinib effectively inhibits target kinase activity and cancer cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth across various fusion partners and cancer types. More importantly, entrectinib\u0027s activity has been validated clinically in patients across multiple fusion partners and tissue histologies.Trk inhibitors, including entrectinib, have shown promising clinical activity in molecularly selected patients. Predictably, potential resistance mechanisms have also begun to emerge. For example, mutations in the Trk kinase domain were identified as one of the in vitro induced resistance mechanisms to the Trk inhibitor, Loxo-101. The three reported resistance mutations in the Ba/F3-MPRIP-NTRK1 cell line model treated with Loxo-101 were F589, G667 and V573. The F589 location on TrkA is equivalent to the gatekeeper mutations, L1196 location on ALK and L2026 location on ROS1. These gatekeeper mutations often arise as resistance mechanisms in patients treated with ALK and ROS1 inhibitors. To test the activity of entrectinib against these three reported NTRK1 mutations, we introduced mutated Trk proteins into Ba/F3 and cancer cell lines and performed dose-dependent proliferation studies. Entrectinib was able to inhibit proliferation of cells harboring each of these three mutations that confer resistance to other Trk inhibitors. Particularly, the IC50 values of entrectinib against kinase domain wildtype and gatekeeper mutated (F589) are essentially unchanged (low single-digit nM), which is consistent with the observation that entrectinib is also able to inhibit the gatekeeper mutation in ALK (L1196) in both cell based assays and in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies.In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that entrectinib is an effective treatment for patients with NTRK-rearranged tumors, including cancers that harbor certain resistance mutations to other Trk inhibitors.","title":"Entrectinib is effective against the gatekeeper and other emerging resistance mutations in NTRK-, ROS1- and ALK- rearranged cancers","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2136"}
