Only a very small activity is present in the junction nevus. In the superficial spreading melanoma the tyrosinase activity is clear, but limited. The lentigo maligna melanoma shows an increased pigmentation. The topmost activity after incubation however is present in the nodular melanoma.","title":"Tyrosinase activity in three types of the malignant melanoma: superficial spreading melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma and nodular melanoma.","pubmedId":"50762"}
