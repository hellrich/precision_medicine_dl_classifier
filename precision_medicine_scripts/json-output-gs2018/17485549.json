Somatic mutations in RUNX1 are preferentially detected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M0, myeloid malignancies with acquired trisomy 21, and certain myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases. By correlating the presence of RUNX1 mutations with cytogenetic and molecular aberration in a large cohort of AML M0 (N \u003d 90) at diagnosis, we detected RUNX1 mutations in 46% of cases, with all trisomy 13 cases (n \u003d 18) being affected. No mutations of NRAS or KIT were detected in the RUNX1-mutated group and FLT3 mutations were equally distributed between RUNX1-mutated and unmutated samples. Likewise, a high incidence of RUNX1 mutations (80%) was detected in cases with trisomy 13 from other French-American-British (FAB) subgroups (n \u003d 20). As FLT3 is localized on chromosome 13, we hypothesized that RUNX1 mutations might cooperate with trisomy 13 in leukemogenesis by increasing FLT3 transcript levels. Quantitation of FLT3 transcript levels revealed a highly significant (P \u003c .001) about 5-fold increase in AML with RUNX1 mutations and trisomy 13 compared with samples without trisomy 13. The results of the present study indicate that in the absence of FLT3 mutations, FLT3 overexpression might be a mechanism for FLT3 activation, which cooperates with RUNX1 mutations in leukemogenesis.","title":"Trisomy 13 is strongly associated with AML1/RUNX1 mutations and increased FLT3 expression in acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"17485549"}
