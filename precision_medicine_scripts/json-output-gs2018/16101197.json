They have a propensity for local relapse and tend to metastasize, frequently with a protracted clinical course. A substantial fraction of the tumors expresses c-Kit or the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta), both targets for imatinib mesylate. No standard systemic therapy is known for these neoplasms.\nc-kit and PDGFRbeta-expression were determined by immunohistochemistry. Four patients with distant metastases and with at least one positive result were treated with 400 mg imatinib mesylate once daily and their response assessed.\nc-Kit and PDGFRbeta expressions were variable among the tumor samples. Toxicity was mild. No remissions were observed.\nThese data support that c-Kit or PDGFRbeta expression per se are not prognostic for the therapeutic response of metastasized ACCs to imatinib mesylate.","title":"Effects of imatinib mesylate on adenoid cystic carcinomas.","pubmedId":"16101197"}
