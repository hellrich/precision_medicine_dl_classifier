However, their roles in angiogenesis and metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) are currently unknown. Objective: To determine Ang-1 and -2 expression profiles and their correlation with disease outcomes in SCCHN. Methods: Tumors from 65 patients with previously untreated SCCHN were stained using antibodies against Ang-1 and Ang-2. Matched peritumoral mucosa was available for 20 patients. Mucosa from 12 patients without SCCHN served as the control group. Intensity of staining was scored semiquantitatively and correlated with clinico-pathological parameters and outcomes. Results: Ang-1 was significantly overexpressed in SCCHN and matched peritumoral mucosa as compared with normal mucosa (both p\u003c0.001). Although overexpression of Ang-1 did not correlate with tumor variables, it did independently predict improved disease-free survival (p\u003d0.044 by Cox proportional hazards model). Ang-2 expression was low in most specimen and did not correlate with any parameter examined in this study. Conclusions: Expression of Ang-1 in SCCHN is associated with improved disease-free survival. The likely mechanism is Ang-1 induced stabilization of blood vasculature and possible suppression of metastasis. Ang-1 may serve as an important prognostic tool and needs to be confirmed by further studies.","title":"Use of angiopoietin-1 expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck to predict disease-free survival.","pubmedId":"ASCO_50252-74"}
