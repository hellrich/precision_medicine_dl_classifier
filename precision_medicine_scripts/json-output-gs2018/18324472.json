This study examines association of the ER/PR/HER2 subtypes with race and breast cancer survival.\nBreast tumors from a population-based cohort of 116 AA and 360 white Atlanta women aged 20-54, diagnosed from 1990 to 1992 were centrally reviewed and tested by immunohistochemistry. Multivariate survival analyses within subtypes (TNT, ER-PR-HER2+, ER+/PR+HER2+, ER+/PR+HER2-) were conducted using weighted Cox regression and included socio-demographic, prognostic, and treatment factors.\nTNTs were more prevalent among young women and particularly among AA women (Odds Ratio [OR] \u003d 1.9, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.2-2.9), adjusting for age, stage, grade, and poverty index. Overall mortality was higher for AA women (Hazard Ratio [HR] \u003d 1.9, 95% CI, 1.5-2.5) and differed by subtypes (P \u003c 0.001). Within the TNT subtype, racial differences in survival persisted, after additional adjustment for treatment and comorbidities (HR \u003d 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.7). TNTs were uniquely associated with high expression of p16, p53, and Cyclin E; and low Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 expression.\nThe high prevalence of TNTs among younger women and particularly younger AA women, along with unique protein expression patterns and poorer survival, suggests varying gene-environment etiologies with respect to age and race/ethnicity and a need for effective therapies.","title":"Race and triple negative threats to breast cancer survival: a population-based study in Atlanta, GA.","pubmedId":"18324472"}
