Twenty-five clinicopathologic variables were selected for univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate their influence on prognosis of ICC.\nCompared with patients with HCC, ICC patients were more common in females and more elderly, had a lower proportion of asymptomatic tumors, lower serum alpha-fetoprotein, higher serum carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and alkaline phosphatase levels; lower incidence of hepatitis history, associated cirrhosis and serum hepatitis B surface antigen; lower proportion of small tumors, well-encapsulated tumors and tumor emboli in the portal vein; higher proportion of single tumor, perihila lymph node involvement and poor differentiation; and less frequency of limited resection (all, P \u003c 0.0001). Distant metastasis was less frequent in patients with ICC (P \u003d 0.027). A total of 5-years overall and disease-free survival (in brackets) after resection was 26.4% (13.1%) and 44.5% (33.1%) (P \u003c 0.0001, P \u003c 0.0001) for patients with ICC and HCC, respectively. Factors influencing survival after resection of ICC can be divided mainly into two categories: early detection of asymptomatic ICC (P \u003c 0.0001) and curative resection (P \u003d 0.002).\nICC Patients have distinct clinicopathologic features as compared with HCC patients. Surgery remains the only effective treatment for ICC. Early detection of asymptomatic ICC and curative resection were the key to achieve optimal survival.","title":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: report of 272 patients compared with 5,829 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"19294418"}
