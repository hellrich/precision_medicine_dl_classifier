When targeting SHRs for BC therapy, the major challenge is how to increase the selectivity of drugs against SHRs in specific cell/tissue. While estrogen- and progesterone- receptors are well studied in BC, glucocorticoid (GC) as a ubiquitous stress activated steroid hormone is less investigated. However, the elevated GC circadian dynamics is associated with poor prognosis, and GC receptor (GR) is highly expressed in metastatic BC. GCs are used successfully as an adjuvant therapy to induce apoptosis of leukemia and lymphoma. However, when applied to BC, the results are controversial with most GCs showing either pro-survival or no effects. To analyze the underlying mechanisms, gene expression profiling was performed in this study using qRT-PCR array that covers the genes as the drivers of BC. Our results showed that compared to MCF7 (luminal subtype) cells, MDA-MB-231(basal B subtype) cells are more responsive to Dexamethasone (Dex; a synthetic GC) treatment with the higher number of genes that were either up- or down-regulated. Shared by both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, the Dex-regulated genes are highly related to cell adhesion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), followed by the genes involved in signal transduction, cell division and apoptosis, including SERPIN-E1, CDKN2A, c-Myc, THBS1, Snai2 and E-cadherin. However, the up- and down-regulation patterns are different between MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells. Using a real-time label-free cell assay, we identified that Dex promotes MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion and migration but only the spreading for MCF7 cells, suggesting that there are cell-specific effects of GC/GR in different subtypes of breast cancer.","title":"Glucocorticoid differentially regulates gene expression in luminal and basal subtypes of breast cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3305"}
