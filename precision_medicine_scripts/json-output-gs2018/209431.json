Lymphocytes infiltrating regressing tumors exhibited a polar accumulation of organelles at the point of contact between lymphocyte and target cell. On the other hand, progressing tumors contained low to moderate numbers of lymphocytes, infrequent lymphocyte-tumor cell interaction and less evidence of tumor cell degeneration. Lymphocytes from progressing tumors lacked the polar organization of organelles. This experimental system is offered as a means of studying the role of lymphocytes in tumor regression.","title":"Differentiation of progressive versus regressive Rous virus-induced avian sarcomas according to tumor and infiltrating lymphocyte fine structure.","pubmedId":"209431"}
