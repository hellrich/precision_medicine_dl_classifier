Epidemiologic studies have evaluated the association between RET L769L and S836S polymorphisms and predisposition to MTC. However, the results were inconclusive. A literature search was performed using the PubMed database for relevant studies published through October 31, 2013. A total of 13 eligible studies were selected for this meta-analysis, including 1,117 cases and 1,916 controls for L769L and 1,230 cases and 2,246 controls for S836S. The carrier frequency of the variant alleles was 26.3 % in patients with MTC and 24.6 % in controls for L769L polymorphism, and 6.6 % in patients with MTC and 5.0 % in controls for S836S polymorphism. In our pooled analysis of all these studies, the results of our meta-analysis suggested that the RET L769L variant was not significantly associated with an elevated MTC risk (odds ratio (OR) 1.06, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.19). And there was no evidence for the association between the S836S variant and MTC risk (OR 1.20, 95 % CI 0.97-1.49). Moreover, no significant differences were found when considering patients or controls heterozygous or homozygous for RET L769L and S836S polymorphisms. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that RET L769L and S836S polymorphisms may not be associated with MTC development.","title":"Quantitative assessment of the association between L769L and S836S polymorphisms at RET gene and medullary thyroid carcinoma risk.","pubmedId":"24699996"}
