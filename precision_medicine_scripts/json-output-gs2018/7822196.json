Mutational inactivation of p53 is the most frequent genetic alteration found in human cancer. Point mutations of the p53 gene have been detected in about 50% of squamous cell carcinomas, basaliomas and cases of Bowen\u0027s disease. A significant portion of these mutations were CC--\u003eTT or C--\u003eT transitions suggestive of UV involvement in mutagenesis. Increased concentrations of p53 protein were immunohistochemically detected in cutaneous malignant melanomas, but p53 mutations are rare in this tumour.","title":"[The tumor suppressor gene p53 and its significance for dermatology].","pubmedId":"7822196"}
