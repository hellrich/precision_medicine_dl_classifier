Immunophenotyping of 216 cases of acute leukemia [acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) \u003d 147 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) \u003d 69] and 18 cases of chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis (CGLBC) with this antibody showed that GM 58/8 reacted with 92% of AML cases (M1-M5) and 100% of myeloblastic crisis in CGL cases. All cases of ALL, lymphoblastic crisis in CGL, erythroleukemia, and erythroblastic crisis in CGL were unreactive with GM 58/8. The antibody revealed the myeloid phenotype in an additional 15 cases of otherwise unclassifiable acute leukemia and six cases of CGLBC. Eleven cases of acute \"mixed lineage\" leukemia were also diagnosed with the help of GM 58/8. The high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (92%) of MoAb GM 58/8 for myeloblastic leukemia is unmatched by almost all previously described myeloid MoAb and proves its usefulness as a single diagnostic reagent for AML and myeloblastic crisis in CGL.","title":"Myeloid lineage specificity and high sensitivity of monoclonal antibody GM 58/8 proves its usefulness as a diagnostic reagent in acute leukemia.","pubmedId":"3300282"}
