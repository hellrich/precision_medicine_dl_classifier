Both have demonstrated significant activity and durable response with a manageable toxicity profile. Despite initial success, ongoing challenges include patient selection and predictors of response, innate resistance and optimizing combination strategies. In this overview, we take a closer look at the history and development of therapeutic targets to the PD-1/PD-ligand (L)1 pathway, clinical evidence, availability of biomarkers and their limitations in clinical practice and future strategies to improve treatment outcomes.
