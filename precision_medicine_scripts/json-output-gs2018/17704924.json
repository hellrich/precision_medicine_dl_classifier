We investigated the presence of adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC), Kirsten-ras (K-ras), p53, microsatellite instability (MSI), and melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) alterations in CRC and correlated the results obtained with clinical data.\nWe collected 78 cancer tissues from CRC patients. Genetic analyses were performed on APC, K-ras, p53, and MSI (BAT 25 and BAT 26), and in addition, MAGE expression was tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Correlations between genetic markers and clinical factors were analyzed after reviewing medical records.\nThe positive rates for alterations of APC, K-ras, p53, MSI, and MAGE in 78 tissue samples were 33.3, 29.5, 34.6, 9.0, and 68.4%, respectively. Mutations were frequently detected in codons 1291 and 1450 of APC, in codon 12 of K-ras and in codons 248, 282, and 176 of p53. APC mutations were frequently noted in early-stage cancer, whereas MSI was observed in right-sided and multiple cancers. No associations were found between the presence of alterations in APC, K-ras, p53, MSI, and MAGE.\nIn Koreans, positive rates of alterations in APC and p53 were slightly lower than those of APC and p53 in Caucasians, and the genetic alterations including MAGE expression are involved in 92.1% of CRCs. The lack of multiple mutations and of a relation between mutation rates and clinical stage suggest that genetic alterations might have independent influences on CRC development in Koreans.","title":"Genetic alterations of APC, K-ras, p53, MSI, and MAGE in Korean colorectal cancer patients.","pubmedId":"17704924"}
