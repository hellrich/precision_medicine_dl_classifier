The number of nucleolar organiser regions correlates with cellular proliferation and has a diagnostic and prognostic value in neoplastic diseases. The aim of this study was to study the morphologic subtypes of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix in biopsy and hysterectomy specimens and to determine the AgNOR counts in these morphologic subtypes. One hundred and seventy-nine cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix were classified into three morphological subtypes namely large cell non keratinising squamous cell carcinoma (113), keratinising squamous cell carcinoma (64) and small cell carcinoma (2). A correlation of histologic typing on biopsy and hysterectomy specimens was done in 142 cases with a complete correlation in 90.5%. Fifty-eight of these tumours were stained with silver nitrate to demonstrate Nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORS). The mean AgNOR count was higher (3.66) in keratinising squamous cell carcinoma, which is known to have a worse prognosis as compared to 3.04 in large cell non keratinising carcinoma and (3.45) in the two cases of small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.","title":"Nucleolar organiser regions and morphologic subtypes of squamous cell carcinoma of cervix.","pubmedId":"9805852"}
