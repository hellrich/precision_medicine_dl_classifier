Preclinical data show anti-tumor synergy between Tan and bortezomib (Bz) and suggest Tan may be neuroprotective, including reversibility of Bz-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN). A phase I study of single agent Tan in advanced MM showed favorable tolerability and modest activity. Methods: 72 patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory MM received 0.7 - 1.3 mg/m2 Bz as IVB followed by 1-hr infusion of 100 -340 mg/m2 Tan on days 1, 4, 8,11 q 21d, with 42 pts receiving the highest dose of both drugs as part of a phase II expansion. Toxicities were assessed by CTCAE v3 and response by modified EBMT criteria. Results: Of 72 pts, 72% had IgG subtype with a median age of 60 yo. Median time since MM diagnosis was 50 mos with median of 5 (1-15) prior regimens. Prior treatments included stem cell transplant (69%), thalidomide (74%), Bz (69%), lenalidomide (28%) and Hsp90 inhibitors (13%). 58 pts with measurable disease were treated at 1 or 1.3 mg/m2 Bz. Response rates ( MR) were 41%, 20% and 14% in the Bz-naive, -pretreated and -refractory pts respectively. In the subgroup with 1-3 prior therapies and who were Bz-naive, the response rate was 56%. Median duration of response (DOR) for all pts with response (n\u003d14) was 10.7 mos, including 3 Bz-refractory pts who had durable PR through mos 12, 22 and 28. 3 other pts remain in response through 24 mos. Of the 72 pts, the most frequent AEs were diarrhea (60%), nausea (49%), fatigue (49%), thrombocytopenia (40%) and AST elevation (28%), which proved manageable with dose reduction and supportive care. Most frequent G3-4 AEs included thrombocytopenia (25%), diarrhea, anemia and fatigue (7% each), as well as back pain and AST elevation (4% each). Only 21% of pts had G1-2 PN; no G3-4 PN was seen. Conclusions: Tan + Bz is active and well tolerated in relapsed/refractory MM, with durable responses in Bz-naive, -pretreated and -refractory pts. Median DOR for the combination compares favorably to Bz monotherapy. Final PFS data will be presented. No severe PN has been observed, consistent with Tan\u0027s neuroprotective effect in pre-clinical models. A phase III study of Tan + Bz vs Bz is ongoing.","title":"Tanespimycin plus bortezomib in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma: Final results of a phase I/II study.","pubmedId":"ASCO_34868-65"}
