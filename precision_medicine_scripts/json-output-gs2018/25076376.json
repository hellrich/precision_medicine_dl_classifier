Impression cytology aided in the initial diagnosis. The patient underwent surgical treatment. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed an invasive amelanotic melanoma limited to the cornea and exhibiting S-100, Melan A, and HMB-45 positivity. The absence of pigmentation delayed early clinical detection and treatment. Awareness of this nonpigmented melanoma is important for early recognition and appropriate management.
