They were derived from a fusion of the NS-1 plasmacytoma cell line with splenocytes from a mouse immunized with human acute myelomonocytic leukemia cells. MY3 and MY4 are expressed by normal monocytes and by greater than 90% of patients with acute monocytic leukemia or acute myelomonocytic leukemia, but are detected much less often on other types of myeloid leukemia. MY7 is expressed by granulocytes, monocytes, and 5% of normal bone marrow cells. 79% of all acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) patients tested (72 patients) express MY7 without preferential expression by any AML subtype. MY8 is expressed by normal monocytes, granulocytes, all peroxidase-positive bone marrow cells, and 50% of AML patients. MY3, MY4, and MY8 define myeloid differentiation antigens in that they are not detected on myeloid precursor cells and appear at discrete stages of differentiation. These antigens are not expressed by lymphocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, or lymphoid malignancies. The monoclonal antisera defining these antigens have been used to study differentiation of normal myeloid cells and malignant cell lines.","title":"Expression of myeloid differentiation antigens on normal and malignant myeloid cells.","pubmedId":"6945311"}
