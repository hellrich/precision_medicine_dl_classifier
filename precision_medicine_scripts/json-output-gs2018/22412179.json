We examined a comprehensive array of risk factors influencing health and disease in an access-to-care, racially diverse, primary HNSCC cohort.\nCross-sectional study.\nPrimary care academic health care system.\nThe cohort of 673 patients comprised 391 CA and 282 AA (42%). Risk variables included demographic, histopathology, and clinical/epidemiologic factors. Tumor DNA was interrogated for loss and gain of 113 genes with known involvement in HNSCC/cancer. Logistic regression for univariate analysis was followed by multivariate modeling with determination of model predictability (c-index).\nOf the 39 univariate differences between AA and CA, multivariate modeling (c-index \u003d 0.81) retained 7 differences (P \u003c .05). AA were less likely to be married and more likely to have tumor lymphocytic response, undergo radiation treatment, and smoke. Insurance type was a significant predictor of race. AA were more likely to have Medicaid, Medicare, and other HMO types. AA tumors were more likely to have loss of CDKN2A and gain of SCYA3 versus CA.\nMultivariate modeling indicated significant differences between AA and CA HNSCC for histopathology, treatment, smoking, marital status, type of insurance, and tumor gene copy number alterations. Our data reiterate that for HNSCC, as in the case of other complex diseases, tumor genetics or biology is only one of many potential contributors to differences among racial groups.","title":"Disparate molecular, histopathology, and clinical factors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma racial groups.","pubmedId":"22412179"}
