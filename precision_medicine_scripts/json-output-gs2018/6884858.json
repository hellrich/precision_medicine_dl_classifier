Epithelioid sarcoma is a malignant lesion, first described by Enzinger in 1970. Although epithelioid sarcoma is the third commonest soft tissue sarcoma in the upper extremity (Bryan, 1974) it still causes confusion in differential diagnosis, both to the surgeon and to the pathologist. Because of its deceptively harmless appearance during the initial period and its clinical and microscopical similarity to an inflammatory process, it is often mistaken for a benign lesion. The purpose of our paper is to draw attention to this rare malignant tumour. This case illustrates a course similar to those described previously. (Enzinger, 1970: Santiago, 1972).","title":"Epithelioid sarcoma in the hand.","pubmedId":"6884858"}
