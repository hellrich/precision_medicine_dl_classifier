However, previous studies with FLT3 inhibitors as single agents in patients with AML showed few clinical responses. In the present study, combined effects of FLT3 selective inhibitor (SC-203048) and NF-κB selective inhibitor (Parthenolide, PTL) on AML xenograft tumor growth in vivo were examined, and the possible antitumor mechanisms by which SC-203048 and PTL affect AML xenograft tumor growth were also detected. Results showed that the tumor growth was strongly inhibited, and increased cell apoptosis was also observed after treatments, especially in the combination group; meanwhile, the expressions of FLT3, p65, cyclin D1, and Bc1-2 decreased significantly, and the expression of nuclear Silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) increased notably. All results indicate that synergism exists between FLT3 and NF-κB inhibitors, and inhibitors combination treatment may be a potential strategy for AML.","title":"Combined effects of FLT3 and NF-κB selective inhibitors on acute myeloid leukemia in vivo.","pubmedId":"21928377"}
