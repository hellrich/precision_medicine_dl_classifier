Eligibility criteria included presence of biopsy-proven stage IVa/b HNSCC without a prior history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess p16 protein expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens.\nOf the 64 patients, 38 showed high p16 expression, and 50 patients responded to chemoradiotherapy, 32 exhibiting a complete and 18 a partial response. Response was significantly associated with p16 expression (P \u003c 0.001) and multivariate analysis indicated that that p16 expression (HR: 2.62, 95%C.I.: 1.14-6.06; P\u003d0.024) was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival.\nHigh p16 expression predicts a better response to chemoradiation in patients with stage IVa/b HNSCC.","title":"High p16 expression predicts a positive response to chemoradiotherapy in stage IVa/b head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"21627359"}
