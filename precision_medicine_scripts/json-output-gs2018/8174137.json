Although a majority of tumor cells in small (\u003c or \u003d 20 mg) solid tumors can be labeled following systemic administration of antitumor cell MAbs, little quantitative information is available as to the distribution of these MAbs within the several compartments that comprise solid tumors. Our goal was to provide such data in a well-characterized melanoma xenograft system. In accord with earlier work, i.v.-injected, melanoma-specific MAbs 436 and IND1, directed, respectively, against the 125 kD and HMW-melanoma-associated antigens, accumulated in M21 and SK-MEL-2 tumor xenografts in amounts of approximately 20% of injected dose/g. However, only 20-24% of the MAbs present in tumor xenografts was bound to tumor cells; the great majority (76-80%) was in the tumor extracellular fluid (ECF) and collagenous residue fractions. These results could not be accounted for by MAb degradation or release of MAbs from tumor cells during xenograft dissociation. Rather, they reflected in large part interactions of MAbs with antigens which tumors had shed into the ECF. Thus, 48 h after i.v. injection of 20 micrograms of melanoma-specific, biotin-tagged MAb, 46-66% of that present in the tumor ECF was complexed with melanoma-associated antigens. Overall, 61-73% of the MAbs recovered from tumor xenografts were bound to tumor antigens (either to tumor cells themselves or to tumor-shed antigens). In contrast, only approximately 4% of a melanoma-nonspecific MAb (B72.3) accumulated per g tumor after i.v. injection and nearly all of this was free in the ECF. Consistent with these data, fluorescence microscopy revealed that i.v.-injected, fluorescein-tagged MAbs achieved highest concentrations in tumor stroma, particularly at the tumor-host interface. Flow cytometry of dissociated solid tumors revealed that both the fraction of MAb-labeled tumor cells and the amount of MAb/tumor cell could be increased by increasing the administered i.v. dose of melanoma-specific MAb. Nonetheless, even at the highest i.v. injected dose (300 micrograms), 15-37% of tumor cells lacked detectable MAb labeling. Taken together, the data indicate that delivery of tumor cell-specific MAbs to solid tumors cannot be equated with their delivery to tumor cells. This distinction is important for immunotherapeutic approaches that require MAb contact with tumor cells.","title":"Compartmental distribution of tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies in human melanoma xenografts.","pubmedId":"8174137"}
