Computed tomography showed multiple lung nodules. Surgery was performed and the pathological diagnosis was large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in the left upper lobe with ipsilobar metastases, and adenocarcinoma in the left lower lobe. The neurological symptoms resolved dramatically after complete resection of the tumors. Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome associated with non-small-cell lung carcinoma is extremely rare. Surgery should not be delayed if a complete resection is expected. ","title":"Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome associated with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26038602"}
