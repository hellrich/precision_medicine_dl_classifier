Histological features examined were lymphocytic infiltrate of the tumor base, lymphocyte infiltration at the tumor margin, and evidence of partial regression in the tumor. NK activity against melanoma cells and non-melanoma cells was studied in the same patients before and after surgical removal of melanoma. Patients with high NK activity against melanoma and Chang cells had less lymphocyte infiltrate at the base of the tumor irrespective of its thickness than did those with low NK activity. Patients with low NK activity and thin tumors had more lymphocyte infiltration at the base of the tumor than did those with high NK activity. Similar results were obtained in certain subsets of cases with respect to lymphocytic infiltration at the tumor margins and to the presence of partial regression. Although the nature of the association between these histological features and NK activity in blood is unknown, it is suggested that previously unexplained associations between histological features and prognosis may be accounted for by their association with NK activity. If this proves to be correct, measurement of NK activity may be an important additional prognostic factor in patients with melanoma.","title":"Relationship between natural killer cell activity and histological features of lymphocyte infiltration and partial regression of the primary tumor in melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"7053864"}
