We hypothesized that low levels of HLA expression lead to a lack of antigen presentation, which might prevent proper immunologic recognition of the tumor. This lack of recognition might subsequently lead to low levels of tumor-infiltrating cells.\nTo test this hypothesis, we determined the type and number of tumor-infiltrating cells in tumor sections from 24 uveal melanomas. We applied monoclonal antibodies directed against different types of immune cells and compared the results with the expression of HLA class I and class II antigens on the tumor cells.\nInfiltrating immune cells were observed in all uveal melanomas (although in small amounts), with a predominance of T lymphocytes. Significant positive correlations were observed between the number of CD3+ cells (T lymphocytes) and monomorphic HLA class I expression, allele-specific HLA-A2 and Bw4 expression, and HLA class II expression. Furthermore, the number of CD4+ cells (T helper cells, monocytes/ macrophages) and of CD11b+ cells (monocytes/macrophages) was significantly correlated with the level of monomorphic HLA class I expression.\nThese data support our hypothesis that low levels of HLA expression (and therefore a lack of presentation of tumor-specific antigens) may lead to a low level of tumor infiltrate.","title":"HLA expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"8750848"}
