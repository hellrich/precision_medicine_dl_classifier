Patients who had N2 lymph node metastases without N1 lymph node involvement were defined as skip N2 and otherwise as non-skip N2. We investigated the difference of clinicopathologic characteristics, recurrence-free survival, overall survival, and spectrum of well-identified molecular alterations in EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, ALK, ROS1, and RET genes in the 2 groups.\nSkip N2 metastasis was found in 45 patients, in whom a remarkably lower incidence of lymphovascular invasion was revealed (P \u003d .01). Skip N2 metastasis was also associated with acinar subtype, good differentiation, and right lung cancer. The recurrence-free survival and overall survival were significantly better in the skip N2 group (5-year recurrence-free survival 37.4% vs 5.7%; log-rank P \u003d .005; 5-year overall survival 60.7% vs 32.1%; log-rank P \u003d .024). The predictive value of skip N2 was more significant in patients with lesions in the right lung (5-year recurrence-free survival 36.6% vs 0.0%; log-rank P \u003d .002; 5-year overall survival 57.2% vs 27.9%; log-rank P \u003d .016) and in patients whose tumor diameter was no more than 3 cm (5-year recurrence-free survival 43.1% vs 6.7%; log-rank P \u003d .01; 5-year overall survival 74.6 vs 27.6%; log-rank P \u003d .04).\nThere are distinct differences in clinicopathologic features and prognosis in patients with or without skip N2 metastasis. Considering the results of our study, subclassifications of mediastinal lymph node metastases could have clinical significance for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Lung adenocarcinoma: Are skip N2 metastases different from non-skip?","pubmedId":"26282606"}
