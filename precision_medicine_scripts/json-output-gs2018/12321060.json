Tubes can be tied, blocked with mechanical devices such as clips or rings, or scarred closed with electric current.  In partial salpingectomy, the most common occlusion technique, the fallopian tubes are cut and tied with a suture material.  This approach is safe, effective, easy to learn, and does not require any special equipment.  Titanium or plastic clips block the fallopian tubes by clamping down and cutting off the blood supply to a portion of the tubes, causing sufficient scarring or fibrosis to prevent fertilization.  Silicone rings also are used to block the tubes mechanically.  A small loop of tube is pulled through the stretched ring and the resultant scarring blocks passage of the sperm or egg.  Finally, electrocoagulation uses electric current to coagulate a small portion of each fallopian tube.  This technique is rarely used, however, because of the risk of organ injury.","title":"Female sterilization occlusion techniques.","pubmedId":"12321060"}
