As more information is generated, it appears that the pathogenesis is related in large part to hormonal alterations but that the histologic features, biologic behavior, and prognosis are similar to tumors in female patients. As a result of larger studies based upon female patients, treatment algorithms have evolved to include multimodality therapy and less radical surgery. Continued research of this disease will continue to define improved methods of detection, prevention, and treatment, and, without the confounding variables of the menstrual cycle, menopause, and childbirth, may also provide a clearer understanding of breast cancer in women.","title":"Male breast cancer.","pubmedId":"8873325"}
