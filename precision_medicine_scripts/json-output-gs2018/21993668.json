We identified 24 somatic mutations in 23 patients with a significantly higher frequency in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (35.1%) as compared to therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (16.4%, P\u003d0.0486). DNMT3A mutations were associated with a normal karyotype and IDH1/2 mutations, but did not affect survival. In contrast to de novo acute myeloid leukemia, most mutations did not affect arginine on position 882, but were predominantly found in the methyltransferase domain. All DNMT3A mutations identified in secondary acute myeloid leukemia were already present in the antecedent disorders indicating an early event. Reduction to homozygosity by uniparental disomy was observed in 2 patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia during disease progression.","title":"Frequency, onset and clinical impact of somatic DNMT3A mutations in therapy-related and secondary acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"21993668"}
