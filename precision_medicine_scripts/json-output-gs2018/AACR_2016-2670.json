Previously, we showed that asparagine, a nonessential amino acid that can be synthesized de novo from glutamine, is both necessary and sufficient for glutamine-dependent cell survival. In addition, asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression positively correlates with the progression of the disease in human glioma patients, suggesting a critical role of asparagine during tumor progression. Interestingly, mammalian cells cannot catabolize asparagine for use as either a nitrogen source or a bioenergetic substrate, potentially due to the loss of asparaginase activity during evolution. Ectopic expression of yeast or zebrafish asparaginase restores the capacity of mammalian cells to utilize asparagine as both bioenergetic and biosynthetic substrates to support cell growth. Furthermore, asparagine restores translation of fast-turn-over proteins under glutamine starvation. Together, the data suggests that asparagine has been evolved to be a metabolic reserve to regulate cellular adaptation to nonessential amino acid limitation in mammalian cells and is therefore a potential target for cancer therapy.","title":"Non-metabolic function of asparagine in regulating global protein translation","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2670"}
