We have focused on the molecular/genetic alterations accompanying the pathogenesis of this malignancy, which may derange the cellular response to external and internal stimuli. A variety of factors influencing cell cycle progression, programmed cell death, drug resistance and immune evasion seem to obtain a predictive--though sometimes argued--role. Taking into account that a great number of these factors develope \"cross-talking\" protein-complex networks, their combined evaluation is likely to contribute towards a more accurate prediction of the clinical outcome in NSCLC patients.","title":"Prognostic factors in non-small cell lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"12017316"}
