Current techniques for assessing the HPV-16 status in HNSCC include the detection of HPV-16 DNA and p16(INK4a) expression in tumor tissues. When tumors originate from hidden anatomical sites, this method can be challenging. A non-invasive and cost-effective alternative to biopsy is therefore desirable for HPV-16 detection especially within a community setting to screen at-risk individuals.\nThe present study compared detection of HPV-16 DNA and RNA in salivary oral rinses with tumor p16(INK4a) status, in 82 HNSCC patients using end-point and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nOf 42 patients with p16(INK4a)-positive tumours, 39 (sensitivity \u003d 92.9 %, PPV \u003d 100 % and NPV \u003d 93 %) had oral rinse samples with detectable HPV-16 DNA, using end-point and quantitative PCR. No HPV-16 DNA was detected in oral rinse samples from 40 patients with p16(INK4a) negative tumours, yielding a test specificity of 100 %. For patients with p16(INK4a) positive tumours, HPV-16 mRNA was detected using end-point reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in 24/40 (sensitivity \u003d 60 %, PPV \u003d 100 % and NPV \u003d 71 %), and using quantitative RT-PCR in 22/40 (sensitivity \u003d 55 %, PPV \u003d 100 % and NPV \u003d 69 %). No HPV-16 mRNA was detected in oral rinse samples from the p16(INK4a)-negative patients, yielding a specificity of 100 %.\nWe demonstrate that the detection of HPV-16 DNA in salivary oral rinse is indicative of HPV status in HNSCC patients and can potentially be used as a diagnostic tool in addition to the current methods.","title":"A pilot study to compare the detection of HPV-16 biomarkers in salivary oral rinses with tumour p16(INK4a) expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.","pubmedId":"26940728"}
