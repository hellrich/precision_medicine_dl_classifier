However, there are few reported cases of successful imatinib therapy in patients with melanoma containing KIT gene mutation or c-kit protein expression.\nA 52-year-old man developed metastatic melanoma from a primary melanoma in the left side of the nasopharynx. The tumour was positive for c-kit protein, and there was a KIT mutation in exon 11. He was treated with imatinib. A follow-up scan one year later showed a complete response. Treatment targeting the biological characteristics of melanoma proved successful in this patient.","title":"Complete response in a melanoma patient treated with imatinib.","pubmedId":"22643209"}
