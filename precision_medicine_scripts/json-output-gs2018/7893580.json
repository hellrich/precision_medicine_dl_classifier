Single doses of didanosine 100 mg were alternated randomly with single doses of stavudine 40 mg on days 1 and 2. Beginning on day 3, subjects received the same doses of both drugs simultaneously every 12 h for nine doses. Serial blood and urine samples were obtained on single dose days 1 and 2, first simultaneous dose day 3, and last simultaneous dose day 7. The average maximum plasma concentrations of didanosine and stavudine before and after simultaneous administration were 422 +/- 184 (s.d.) ng ml-1 and 603 +/- 160 (s.d.) ng ml-1, and 419 +/- 153 (s.d.) ng ml-1 and 726 +/- 188 (s.d.) ng ml-1, respectively. Didanosine and stavudine AUC values before and after simultaneous administration were 615 +/- 170 (s.d.) ng ml-1 h and 1246 +/- 230 (s.d.) ng ml-1 h, 637 +/- 155 (s.d.) ng ml-1 h and 1326 +/- 267 (s.d.) ng ml-1 h, respectively. No significant changes in maximum plasma concentration, AUC elimination half-life, or renal clearance of didanosine and stavudine were observed when the drugs were administered simultaneously. Co-administration of didanosine 100 mg and stavudine 40 mg is well tolerated and the drugs do not interact pharmacokinetically.","title":"Pharmacokinetics of co-administered didanosine and stavudine in HIV-seropositive male patients.","pubmedId":"7893580"}
