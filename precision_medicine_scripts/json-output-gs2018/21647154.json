Somatic IDH1/IDH2 mutations were rare in ALL (N\u003d1), but were more common in AML, occurring in 3.5% (IDH1 N\u003d3 and IDH2 N\u003d5), with the frequency higher in AMLs with a normal karyotype (9.8%). The identified IDH1 mutations occurred in codon 132 resulting in replacement of arginine with either cysteine (N\u003d3) or histidine (N\u003d1). By contrast, mutations in IDH2 did not affect the homologous residue but instead altered codon 140, resulting in replacement of arginine with either glutamine (N\u003d4) or tryptophan (N\u003d1). Structural modeling of IDH2 suggested that codon 140 mutations disrupt the enzyme\u0027s ability to bind its substrate isocitrate. Accordingly, recombinant IDH2 R140Q/W were unable to carry out the decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), but instead gained the neomorphic activity to reduce α-KG to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarete (2-HG). Analysis of primary leukemic blasts confirmed high levels of 2-HG in AMLs with IDH1/IDH2 mutations. Interestingly, 3/5 AMLs with IDH2 mutations had FLT3-activating mutations, raising the possibility that these mutations cooperate in leukemogenesis.","title":"IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in pediatric acute leukemia.","pubmedId":"21647154"}
