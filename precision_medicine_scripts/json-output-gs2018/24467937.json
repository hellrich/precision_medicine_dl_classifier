Many patients are treated with weekly cisplatin; it is not known whether weekly and high-dose cisplatin are equivalent. This study compares the outcomes of patients with locally-advanced HPV-negative HNSCC and HPV/p16-positive oropharynx HNSCC treated with adjuvant chemoradiation therapy with either high-dose or weekly cisplatin.\nRetrospective review of patients with Stage III/IV HNSCC who had surgery followed by adjuvant chemoradiation therapy at Mayo Clinic, Rochester. HPV and/or p16 status was available for all oropharynx patients.\n104 Patients (51 high-dose, 53 weekly) were analyzed. The 3-year overall survival was 84% and 75% for patients who received high dose and weekly cisplatin, respectively (p\u003d0.30). The 3-year recurrence free survival was 71% and 74% in the high dose and weekly cisplatin group, respectively (p\u003d0.95). Patients with HPV/p16-positive oropharynx cancer who received adjuvant chemoradiation therapy with high-dose and weekly cisplatin had three-year overall survival rates of 91% and 86% (p\u003d0.56), and 3-year recurrence free survival of 84% and 82% (p\u003d0.93). Extracapsular extension did not affect prognosis in either group.\nNo significant survival difference was seen between patients with locally advanced HNSCC treated with adjuvant chemoradiation therapy with high-dose or weekly cisplatin, although there was a trend for improved survival with high-dose cisplatin. Weekly cisplatin in the adjuvant setting may be a better treatment for patients with HPV-positive oropharynx cancer to preserve survival and minimize toxicity.","title":"Adjuvant chemoradiation therapy with high-dose versus weekly cisplatin for resected, locally-advanced HPV/p16-positive and negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24467937"}
