The aim of this study was to evaluate palpation and ultrasound examination in the diagnostics of lymph node metastases in locally advanced melanoma.\n83 patients suffering from melanoma (Clark level IV or V) were examined for lymph node metastases by palpation and sonography. Findings were compared to histopathologic results after lymph node extirpation if available or the findings at the next follow-up visit.\nLymph node metastases were confirmed histopathologically in 14 patients at the first study visit, in three others at the control visit. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of palpation for the detection of metastases or suspicious nodes with increasing volume at follow-up in this population were 65%, 81%, 48%, and 89%, and of ultrasound 100%, 66%, 45%, and 100%, respectively.\nSonography of lymph nodes should be included as a standard procedure in the detection of metastases of locally advanced malignant melanoma.","title":"[Detection of lymph node metastases of malignant melanoma by palpation and ultrasound].","pubmedId":"14685681"}
