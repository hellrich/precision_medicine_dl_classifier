We investigated the diagnostic usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 23 lesions of primary malignant melanoma, metastatic malignant melanoma, and benign pigmented skin tumors.\nThe morphologic characteristics and the signal intensity of the tumors were analyzed to differentiate malignant and benign pigmented skin tumors by means of the tumor-to-fat contrast ratio of the signal intensity.\nThe morphologic characteristics of the tumors obtained by MRI were not an absolute criterion for diagnosis of malignant melanoma, but the signal intensity of the tumor assessed by the tumor-to-fat contrast ratio on T2-weighted images clearly differentiated between primary malignant melanoma and benign pigmented skin tumors.\nThese findings indicated that MRI is useful for noninvasive diagnosis of malignant melanoma.","title":"Diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging in malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"1619076"}
