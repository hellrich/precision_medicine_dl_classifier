The web was divided by sharp dissection. Untreated, this thin web would almost certainly have resulted in dysphagia postoperatively. The authors therefore recommend routine open diverticulectomy for the management of Zenker\u0027s diverticulum, to allow inspection of the esophageal lumen for concomitant disease and palpation of the cricopharyngeal muscle at the time of myotomy.","title":"Esophageal web associated with Zenker\u0027s diverticulum: a possible cause of continuing dysphagia after diverticulectomy.","pubmedId":"3926291"}
