Other families seem vulnerable to melanoma alone. In the majority of these families, the propensity to melanoma is associated with the presence of abnormal melanocytic naevi, the so-called atypical mole syndrome (AMS) phenotype. However, in a smaller number of families, individuals are susceptible to melanoma but have normal naevi. There appears, therefore, to be clinical (and probably genetic) heterogeneity. Segregation analysis does not support a predisposition by single dominant gene as an explanation for the AMS/melanoma syndrome. To date, a single gene which is clearly important for susceptibility to melanoma has not been identified. Karyotypic studies of melanoma tumours have pointed to chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 9 and 10 as possible sites for melanoma related genes. Loss of heterozygosity studies have suggested that chromosome 9 may carry a tumour suppressor gene important in familial disease, and linkage studies appear to confirm this. It is not yet clear, however, what percentage of familial melanoma is attributable to this gene. A more longstanding suggestion that a gene on chromosome 1 may be important has not been confirmed, but a chromosome/gene may be responsible for susceptibility in a small subset of melanoma families. Even within AMS families, there is a lack of concordance between the AMS phenotype and susceptibility to melanoma. This might be explained either by the effects of modifying genes, or the environment.","title":"Genetics of melanoma.","pubmedId":"7987647"}
