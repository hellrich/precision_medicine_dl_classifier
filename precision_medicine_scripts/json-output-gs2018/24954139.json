We analyzed the expression pattern of TGFbeta-signaling components and screened for mutations in tgfbetaR1, egfr, kras and braf in KAs and SCCs.\nImmunohistochemical analysis of TGFbeta1, TGFbetaR1, TGFbetaR2 and phospho-SMAD2/3 was performed on skin tumors (29 KAs, 30 well and 31 moderately differentiated SCCs). Mutation screening in hotspot regions of tgfbetaR1, egfr, kras and braf was performed through pyrosequencing of tumor DNA.\nExpression of TGFbeta1, TGFbetaR1 and p-SMAD2/3 was increased in tumors as compared to surrounding skin. In KAs characteristic strong discontinuous membranous TGFbetaR1 expression pattern frequently associated with kras mutation was noted. SCCs showed continuous TGFbetaR1 expression, stronger p-SMAD2/3 expression and less frequent kras mutations. In tumors at sun-exposed sites stronger TGFbetaR1 expression was noted. One SCC showed tgfbetaR1 mutation, but no other mutations were found.\nAlthough tgfbetaR1 germline mutations cause inherited KAs and our finding of strong discontinuous membranous expression in KAs suggests accumulation of functionally altered protein, we found no tgfbetaR1 mutations or influence on TGFbeta-signaling, but frequent kras mutations in this subgroup of KAs. Characteristic TGFbetaR1 expression pattern in KA can facilitate histopathologic distinction from SCC.","title":"Pattern of TGFbeta receptor 1 expression differs between kras-mutated keratoacanthomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.","pubmedId":"24954139"}
