One reason immunotherapy has not met expectations may be due to immunosuppression in the local environment of the tumor. Immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are increased in the peripheral blood of melanoma patients and the frequency of MDSCs correlates with overall survival and disease progression. Furthermore, cytokines related to the recruitment and differentiation of MDSCs are also increased in melanoma patient serum and changes in these cytokine levels may correlate with disease progression. We find an increased frequency of regulatory T cells, PD-1-expressing T cells, and PD-L1 expressing MDSCs in primary melanoma tumors, suggesting that PD-1/PD-L1 interactions may play a role in immunosuppression in the microenvironment of the tumor. We are currently investigating the mechanisms of immunosuppression used by human MDSCs and whether the suppressive function of MDSCs can be blocked with antibodies targeting PD-L1. In conclusion, we have established MDSCs as an important player in immunosuppression in melanoma patients suggesting that combinatorial treatments that reduce the frequency or activity of MDSCs may improve the effectiveness of future immunotherapies.","title":"Immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells expressing PDL1 are increased in human melanoma tumor tissue","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1671"}
