To determine the role and underlying mechanisms of SRC-1 overexpression in BC progression and metastasis, a transgenic mouse model with overexpression of human SRC-1 in mouse mammary epithelial cells was created. In vivo data revealed that overxpression of SRC-1 potentiated BC metastasis to lung in both MMTV/Neu and MMTV/TVA/PyMT tumor models. While SRC-1 overexpression did not obviously accelerate tumor growth in these BC mouse models, the number of tumor cells invaded into blood vessels and metastasis index in lung tissue significantly increased in these mice. In addition to the elevated Twist expression and activation of Her2 and AKT driven by SRC-1 overexpression in the tumors, CSF-1 level was significantly increased in SRC-1 overexpressed tumors. We also found that CSF-1 expression was decreased in two PyMT/SRC-1 KO tumor cell lines compared with the two PyMT/WT control cell lines. Knockdown of SRC-1 in PyMT/WT cells or human BC cells reduced CSF-1 levels, while adenoviral-mediated expression of SRC-1 in PyMT/SRC-1 KO cells or human BC cells significantly promoted CSF-1 expression. Furthermore SRC-1 was found to interact with transcription factors, c-jun and c-fos, to activate the csf-1 promoter. Both SRC-1 and c-fos were found to associate with the csf-1 promoter at AP-1 binding sites in human BC cells. This study provided compelling evidence that overexpression of SRC-1 promotes BC metastasis. Targeting SRC-1 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for controlling BC metastasis.","title":"SRC-1 up-regulates CSF-1 expression to potentiate breast cancer metastasis","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1399"}
