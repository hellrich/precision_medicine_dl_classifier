Although often depicted as a linear sequence of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2, this pathway is also regulated by expression of multiple isoforms of proteins at each level, scaffold proteins that enhance pathway activation, and negative feedback mechanisms. Some of these factors may also impact on the response of the pathway to pharmacological inhibitors. To test this notion, we analyzed resistance to the RAF inhibitor, PLX4720, using mutant BRAF melanoma cell models. In a screen to isolate cells displaying resistance to the inhibitory effects of PLX4720, we observed a subset of cells harboring an acquired mutation in NRAS. In parental cells, expression of mutant NRAS was sufficient to prevent PLX4720-mediated inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling, entry into S phase and susceptibility to apoptosis in mutant BRAF cells. Effects of mutant NRAS were associated with the maintenance of RAF binding. Analysis of isolated clones of RAF inhibitor-resistant mutant BRAF cells demonstrated that re-activation of the ERK1/2 pathway in the presence of PLX4720 was dependent on NRAS, BRAF, CRAF, and the RAS-RAF scaffold protein, SHOC2/Sur-8. Depletion of SHOC2 also rendered resistant cells susceptible to PLX4720-mediated apoptosis in 3D collagen. Together, these data demonstrate the role of RAF isoforms and a RAS-RAF scaffold protein in the acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors induced by secondary mutations in NRAS.","title":"RAF signaling and SHOC2 mediate mutant NRAS acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors in melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2158"}
