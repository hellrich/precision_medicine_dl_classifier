The prognosis for patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC is generally poor with low 5-year survival rates despite treatment advances over the past few decades. Consequently, it is essential to search for new biomarkers and effective therapy options to optimize HNSCC treatment. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in approximately 90% of tumours. EGFR has become one of most common targets for new therapies being investigated in HNSCC. In this way, multiple therapies targeting EGFR in HNSCC have been tested but response rates are still low especially in the recurrent or metastatic setting. This has been attributed to mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies. Afatinib, an oral small molecule ErbB Family Blocker that irreversibly binds to ErbB1 (EGFR), ErbB2 (HER2) and ErbB4 (HER4), is being investigated in HNSCC treatment with encouraging phase II results and several ongoing phase III trials. Results of these trials will help to understand the place of afatinib in the HNSCC treatment armamentarium.
