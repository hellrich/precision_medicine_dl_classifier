Presence of multiple aberrations may account for drug resistance as well as strategies for combination therapies. We examined concurrent aberrations of biomarkers in NSCLC to present an overview of potential patient cohorts who may benefit from such combinations.   Methods:  6,785 NSCLC cases were evaluated.  Specific testing was performed and included a multiplatform approach: sequencing (Sanger, NGS), protein expression (IHC) and gene amplification (CISH/FISH).   Results:  The EGFR mutation (MT) rate in this population was 12.7% (135/1059), of which 57% (55/96) overexpressed EGFR (IHC) and 61% (169/277) had EGFR gene amplification (FISH).  This demonstrates the dependence on the EGFR pathway and potential importance of dual inhibition with cetuximab and EGFR TKIs.  66% (63/96) and 7% (6/90) of EGFR MT patients were MET high (IHC) and amplified (CISH), respectively, suggesting potential benefit from dual targeting of EGFR and MET.  Interestingly, TP53 mutations were observed in 54% (70/129) of EGFR MT which has important implications for resistance to EGFR TKIs and possible cross-resistance to radiotherapy.  ALK translocations were observed in 101 of 3611 (2.8%) patients, among which 19% (7/36), 3% (1/29) and 2% (1/48) carried concurrent EGFR, MET and HER2 amplification (ISH), respectively, suggesting the potential for combining crizotinib with agents such as cetuximab, onartuzumab or trastuzumab.  A BRAF mutation was observed in 3.3% (34/1061), among which EGFR and MET expression was high by IHC (both have been implicated in resistance to BRAFi in other tumor types) in 58% (15/26) and 48% (12/25), respectively, indicating benefit from combination of newly approved dabrafenib with cetuximab or onartuzumab.   Conclusions:  This is one of the largest analyses in the United States of biomarkers in NSCLC.Our study shows the non-exclusive activation of multiple pathways.  These results also show the importance of multiplatform testing as both protein, gene copy number and genetic alterations were detected.","title":"Tumor biomarker evaluation of 6,785 patients for combination treatment strategies in NSCLC.","pubmedId":"ASCO_133696-144"}
