Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on DNA samples from 29 LMS, 9 ARMS, 7 anaplastic ERMS and 6 classic ERMS. Alteration of one or more of the 12q13-15 genes was revealed in 13/29 LMS (45%) and 12/22 RMS (54%) including 5/9 ARMS (56%), 5/7 anaplastic ERMS (71%) and 2/6 classic ERMS (33%). The potential importance of overproduction of protein products in neoplastic development, led us also to study a possible high expression of cdk4, mdm2 and gli proteins in immunohistochemical staining experiments on paraffin-embedded tissue samples of the same cases. Among LMS and RMS most cases with CDK4, MDM2 and GLI gene alterations also showed a simultaneous high expression of the relative protein. In summary, these results indicate that amplification or overerepresentation of genes at 12q13-15 region involve both LMS and RMS. Moreover these genes alterations reveal predominantly in the alveolar and in the anaplastic variant of the embryonal subtype. These two seem to have a more similar behavior than anaplastic and classic embryonal that are classified in the same subtype.","title":"Amplification of CDK4, MDM2, SAS and GLI genes in leiomyosarcoma, alveolar and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.","pubmedId":"15024701"}
