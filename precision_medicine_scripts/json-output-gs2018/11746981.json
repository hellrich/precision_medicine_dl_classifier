RET is also found mutated in sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and rearranged in sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas. Here, we describe a previously unreported germline RET mutation at codon 603 in exon 10 associated with both MTC and nonmedullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) in a kindred. RET may thus not be excluded as a potential candidate for predisposition to some forms of NMTC.","title":"Novel germline RET mutation segregating with papillary thyroid carcinomas.","pubmedId":"11746981"}
