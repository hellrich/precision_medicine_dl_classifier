To evaluate them, we conducted a retrospective study. The medical records of all lung cancer patients at our division from January 1984 through July 2008 were reviewed. Twenty-one (1.7%) of 1242 patients had previous or simultaneous upper aerodigestive cancers. Twenty patients were smokers. For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 6 patients underwent surgical resection and 3 were treated with chemotherapy. Three small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients had chemotherapy. None of the severe complication related to the comorbidities were observed. The median survival for NSCLC and SCLC patients was 15 and 6 months, respectively. For patients with upper aerodigestive cancers, smoking cessation, a chest radiograph or computed tomography scan at least yearly and swift evaluation of signs or symptoms that are suggestive of lung cancer should be recommended.","title":"Lung cancer patients with previous or simultaneous the upper aerodigestive cancers.","pubmedId":"19714511"}
