GD2 is a glycolipid found on the surface of tumour cells, which is overexpressed in neuroblastoma. Dinutuximab, an IgG1 human/mouse chimeric switch variant of murine monoclonal antibody 14G2a, binds to GD2 and induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The US FDA has recently approved the use of dinutuximab combination therapy for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in paediatric patients. The marketing authorization application for dinutuximab is under regulatory review in the EU, and phase I-III development is underway in several other countries. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of dinutuximab leading to this first approval for use (in combination with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-2 and 13-cis retinoic acid) in the treatment of paediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who achieve at least partial response to prior first-line multiagent, multimodality therapy.","title":"Dinutuximab: first global approval.","pubmedId":"25940913"}
