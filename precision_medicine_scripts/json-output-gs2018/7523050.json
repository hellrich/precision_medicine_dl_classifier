SCLC must be distinguished from non-small-cell carcinoma (NSCLC) and lymphoma. Paranuclear blue inclusions (PBIs) were recently described as a feature of metastatic SCLC on air-dried Wright-stained bone marrow aspirate smears. To determine the utility of PBIs in distinguishing SCLC from NSCLC and lymphoma, we evaluated air-dried Diff-Quik-stained smears from 103 fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens and 14 touch imprint specimens. PBIs were identified in 24 (89%) of 27 cases of SCLC, in 6 (9%) of 64 non-small-cell carcinomas (P \u003c 0.00001), and in two (8%) of the 26 lymphoma cases (P \u003c 0.00001). No PBIs were seen on any of the alcohol-fixed Papanicolaou or hematoxylin-eosin (H\u0026E) stained smears examined. In conclusion, PBIs appear to be a feature of SCLC on air-dried cytologic material stained with Romanowsky type stains. In the presence of cytologic features of SCLC, the identification of PBIs provides a useful diagnostic feature for differentiating between SCLC and NSCLC carcinomas, and between SCLC and lymphomas in FNA specimens and touch imprints from surgical specimens.","title":"Paranuclear blue inclusions: an aid in the cytopathologic diagnosis of primary and metastatic pulmonary small-cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"7523050"}
