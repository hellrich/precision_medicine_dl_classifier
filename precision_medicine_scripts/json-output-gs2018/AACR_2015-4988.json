A7-nAChR has become a potential therapeutic target for cancer. Highly expression of A7-nAChR caused the benefit of cell survival in gastric cancers. However, it is unclear for the role of A7-nAChR in chemotherapy therapy on gastric cancer. Methods: In this study, we generated A7-nAChR knockdown (A7-nAChR-KD) AGS cells by a short interfering RNA (siRNA) technique in gastric cancer cells. The anti-proliferation effects of chemotherapy drugs were determined by biosensor system, MTT assay, TUNEL assay, and cell cycle determination.Results: We determined the IC50 of 5-FU, taxane, epirubicin, cisplastin, gemcitabine, labtinibine, sunitinib in both A7-nAChR-Kd cells and scrambled control cells by MTT assay. We found that there is no difference between A7-nAChR-KD cells and scrambled control cells for epirubicin, cisplastin, labtinibine, sunitinib treatments. Interestingly, A7-nAChR-KD cells were less resistant to taxane treatment compared with the scrambled control cells. The apoptosis cell population was increased less in scrambled control cells treated with taxane than A7-nAChR-KD cells in cell cycle distribution and TUNEL assays. Conclusions: We conclude that A7-nAChR may be a key biomarker in mediating the chemotherapy efficacy on gastric cells.","title":"A7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mediated the chemosensitivity of gastric cancer cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4988"}
