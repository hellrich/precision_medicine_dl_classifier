Specifically, taking the advantage of stable BRAF knockdown, we were able to show continued suppression of PTC cell proliferation and transformation, or anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar, after long-term culture. Moreover, we also demonstrated that in vivo tumorigenicity and growth of tumors from the specific BRAF siRNA cell clones in nude mice were suppressed compared with control clones.\nBRAF V600E is not only an initiator of PTC as demonstrated previously but is also a maintainer of proliferation, transformation, and tumorigenicity of PTC cells harboring BRAF mutation, and growth of tumors derived from such cells continues to depend on BRAF V600E. These results provide further support for potentially effective therapy targeted at BRAF for BRAF mutation-harboring PTC.","title":"BRAF V600E maintains proliferation, transformation, and tumorigenicity of BRAF-mutant papillary thyroid cancer cells.","pubmedId":"17374713"}
