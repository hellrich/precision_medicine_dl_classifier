Molecular dynamic simulation suggested that this truncation and insertion of new 10 AA results in structural changes similar to those seen in BCR-ABL with T315I mutation. Here we evaluate the prevalence of BCR-ABL135INS in imatinib-resistant CML, examine the effect of this mutation on resistance to compared the efficiency of various kinase inhibitors in vitro, and suggest a model for persistent CML and a possible strategy to eradicate residual disease. Methods: Using a sensitive PCR method, we determined the prevalence of the alternatively spliced BCR-ABL135INS mRNA in 288 patients with chronic-phase CML resistant to imatinib. Expression of truncated protein was confirmed by Western blot. We then tested the effectiveness of various kinase inhibitors on human K562 CML cells expressing different levels of BCR-ABL135INS along with wild-type BCR-ABL1. Results: BCR-ABL135INS mRNA was detected in 210 (73%) of the 288 patients. Only 25% of BCR-ABL135INS positive cases showed coexistance of ABL1 kinase point mutation. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that expression of the predicted 143-kD BCR-ABL135INS protein at levels proportional to those predicted by mRNA. Expression of BCR-ABL135INS in K562 cells was sufficient to conferred resistance to imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib in a dose-dependant fashion. However, no resistance was detected using aurora kinase inhibitor (MK 0457) or homoharringtonine (HHT). BCR-ABL135INS suppressed imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib-mediated dephosphorylation of CRKL, LYN, SRC, and STAT5, but had no effect on MK 0457-mediated dephosphorylation. The combination of imatinib with nilotinib or HHT showed strong synergy, overcoming BCR-ABL135INS-induced resistance in vitro. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the importance of the overlooked alternatively spliced BCR-ABL135INS protein and may provide a strategy to treat resistant disease and eradicate residual CML.","title":"Alternatively spliced truncated BCR-ABL1 protein in CML patients with resistance to kinase inhibitors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_33284-65"}
