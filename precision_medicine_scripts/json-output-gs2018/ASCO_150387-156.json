This inactivation causes an overexpression of the target genes of HIF-dependent transcription factor. VHL/HIF/VEGF pathway thus has a major role in oncogenesis and is currently targeted by anti-VEGF therapy. The emergence of resistance leads to the development of immunotherapy. The interaction of programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1) with its receptor (PD-1) on T cells inactivates antitumor immune responses. PD-L1 expression appears to be associated with poor outcome in ccRCC. The correlation between complete VHL status and the expression of PD-L1 has not yet been investigated.  Methods:  In this study, we correlated the complete status of the VHL gene in 98 ccRCC cases with pathological criteria, expression of PDL1 and clinical outcome. For these patients, we had 64 months median follow-up. From frozen tumor sections, VHL gene deletion, mutation and promoter hypermethylation were screened. PD-L1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on the highest Fuhrman nuclear grade and considered positive when any membranous tumor cell staining was detected.  Results:   33.6% of ccRCCs had 0 or 1 alteration (non inactivated VHL) versus 66.3% with 2 inactivating events (inactivated VHL). Non inactivated VHL ccRCCs were associated with a higher Fuhrman grade 4 (p \u003d 0.02), metastases (p \u003d 0.04), sarcomatoid component (p \u003d 0.01) and dense lymphocyte infiltrate (p \u003d 0.013). Furthermore, in this group, wild type VHL tumors (no alteration of the VHL gene, 11,2%), were particularly associated with PD-L1 expression (p \u003c 0,0001), and had a worse outcome with a median specific survival of 33 months (p \u003d 0.016).  Conclusions:   This long-term study is the first to analyze complete VHL gene status in ccRCC in association with PDL1 expression. Wild type VHL ccRCCs represent a distinct entity with probably different involved oncogenic pathways. Interestingly, they overexpress PD-L1 and may benefit therapies inhibiting PD-L1/PD-1.","title":"Wild type VHL clear cell renal cell carcinomas: A distinct morphological and clinical entity with PD-L1 expression.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150387-156"}
