The influence of mutations such as BRAF, NRAS, CDKN2A and P53 on treatment response in the PD1 inhibitor era has not been well defined. Methods: This study included patients with melanoma with a cutaneous or unknown primary. All patients had genomic profiling with the Mayo Clinic 50-gene solid tumor mutation panel. Treatment response to first line immunotherapy with PD1, CTLA-4, or combination PD1/CTLA-4 inhibitors were assessed by response rate and time-to-progression (TTP) rate at 12 months. Each patient outcome was stratified by non-mutually exclusive gene mutation status into BRAF, NRAS, P53, CDKN2A, or quadruple negative (N4) groups. Results: Genomic profiling was performed on 208 patients, of whom 102 received first line immunotherapy. Most patients received a PD1 inhibitor (n \u003d 62), followed by CTLA-4 inhibitor (n \u003d 34), and combination therapy (n \u003d 6). A trend towards improved outcomes was observed in CDKN2A and BRAF mutated patients with worse outcomes noted in P53, N4, and NRAS patients. The percent without progression at 12 months were BRAF 52.2%, CDKN2A 58.2%, NRAS 30.5%, P53 37.7%, and N4 26.7% (see table below). Response rates were BRAF 46.4%, CDKN2A 38.5%, NRAS 22.2%, P53 40.0%, and N4 33.3%. Conclusions: There is a trend towards improved outcomes with immunotherapy in BRAF and CDKN2A mutated patients while P53, NRAS and N4 patients have inferior outcomes.
