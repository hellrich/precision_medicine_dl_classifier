Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to confirm the 4q12 deletion.\nThe FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion transcript was found in 8 (33%) of 24 patients with HES, corresponding to the chromosome 4q12 deletion identified by FISH. The FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-associated patients diagnosed with CEL, frequently had hepatosplenomegaly, eosinophil-related tissue damage, anemia, thrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis and a short overall survival time. Nevertheless, imatinib mesylate induced rapid and complete hematological responses in treated FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha cases, followed by molecular remission and reversal of myelofibrosis. FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion could co-exist with other mutations of tyrosine kinase family genes, like FLT3 or PDGFRbeta. We also demonstrated that the SNPs of PDGFRbeta were associated with selective splicing of exon 19 in case 20.\nCorrelating the CEL genotype with phenotype, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha emerges as a relatively homogeneous clinicobiological entity that co-exists with other abnormalities of tyrosine kinase family genes. It reflects the disease progression and there is a good response to imatinib. Detection of the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene is valid for both CEL diagnosis and therapy surveillance.","title":"FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha alone or with other genetic abnormalities reveals disease progression in chronic eosinophilic leukemia but good response to imatinib.","pubmedId":"18706197"}
