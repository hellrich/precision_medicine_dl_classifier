There was no family history of MEN 2B in her family. DNA testing was carried out and a point mutation was found in exon 16, codon 918 (ATG to ACG) in the RET proto-oncogene. The woman died of medullary thyroid carcinoma, 13 years after a total thyroidectomy.","title":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.","pubmedId":"11442663"}
