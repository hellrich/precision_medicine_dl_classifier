There is also evidence from experimental studies that atrophy is a complication of vasectomy, a recently reported risk factor. In the area of new diagnostic approaches, correlation of the rate of rise of tumor markers after orchiectomy in patients with metastases has defined a new risk factor for predicting drug-resistant disease. In the treatment of nonseminoma, it has been reported that use of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage I tumors with two courses of combination chemotherapy produces a relapse rate lower than that seen after surgical staging. For seminoma, chemotherapy results have improved, with nearly 100% of patients cured by combination regimens and 80% cured by single-agent carboplatin. This success is finally leading to questioning of the role of radiotherapy as adjuvant therapy for stage I tumors. A study using two courses of adjuvant carboplatin produced equivalent results and possibly less toxicity.","title":"Testicular cancer.","pubmedId":"1654130"}
