Originally characterized as a morphologically unique soft-tissue sarcoma subtype of unclear etiology in 1963, with a following 15 years of research only to conclude that \"the issue of histogenesis [of MFH] is largely unresolvable\"; it is \"now regarded as synonymous with [high grade] undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and essentially represents a diagnosis of exclusion\". Yet despite this apparent lack of progress, the first decade of the 21st century has seen some significant progress in terms of defining the origins of MFH. Perhaps more importantly these origins might also pave the way for novel therapies. This manuscript will highlight MFH\u0027s troubled history, discuss recent advances, and comment as to what the coming years may promise and what further needs to be done to make sure that progress continues.","title":"MFH classification: differentiating undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in the 21st Century.","pubmedId":"19671033"}
