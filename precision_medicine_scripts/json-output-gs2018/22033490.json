In the current study of 277 patients with MDS, IDH mutations were detected in 34 (12%) cases: 26 IDH2 (all R140Q) and 8 IDH1 (6 R132S and 2 R132C). Mutational frequency was 4% (2 of 56) in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, 12% (16 of 130) in refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 14% (2 of 14) in MDS-unclassifiable, 14% (6 of 42) in refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1 and 23% (8 of 35) in RAEB-2. Normal karyotype was noted in all but one IDH1-mutated cases and 13 IDH2-mutated cases. Multivariable analysis identified presence of mutant IDH1 (P\u003d0.0004; hazard ration 4.0, 95% confidence interval 1.9-8.8), revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk category (P\u003c0.0001), and red cell transfusion need (P\u003d0.002) as independent predictors of inferior survival. In a similar multivariable analysis, mutant IDH1 was the only variable associated with shortened leukemia-free survival (P\u003d0.001; hazard ration 7.0, 95% confidence interval 2.3-20.8). The presence of IDH2R140Q did not affect the overall (P\u003d0.54) or leukemia-free (P\u003d0.81) survival. The current study suggests a powerful adverse prognostic effect for mutant IDH1 in MDS.","title":"Differential prognostic effect of IDH1 versus IDH2 mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes: a Mayo Clinic study of 277 patients.","pubmedId":"22033490"}
