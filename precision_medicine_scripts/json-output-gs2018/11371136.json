Changes in BRCA1, p53, and p21 protein levels were assayed by immunoblotting. Ovarian tumors with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were screened for mutations in TP53 by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.\nAntisense inhibition of BRCA1 protein caused p53 and p21 protein levels to rise, indicating that partial loss of BRCA1 function activates the p53 DNA damage response pathway. Somatic mutation of TP53 was observed in 7 of 14 BRCA-associated ovarian tumors.\nOur findings provide novel evidence that loss of BRCA1 function in human cells activates the p53 DNA damage response pathway and that loss of this pathway, by somatic mutation of TP53, is a likely requirement for BRCA-associated tumor development.","title":"Antisense inhibition of BRCA1 expression and molecular analysis of hereditary tumors indicate that functional inactivation of the p53 DNA damage response pathway is required for BRCA-associated tumorigenesis.","pubmedId":"11371136"}
