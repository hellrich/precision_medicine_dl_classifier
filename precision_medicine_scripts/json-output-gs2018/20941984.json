Malignant melanoma metastasis can develop in all viscera, including brain. They are encephalophiles. Rarely, the primary tumor remains unknown. Treatment of this metastasis is complex.\nA 50-year-old man in an excellent clinical condition was diagnosed with multiple metastasis. Lesions were diagnosed using modem imaging methods: MRI, PET-scan. They were treated by chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. In the evolution of the disease, appeared brain metastases.\nThe chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy have not stopped the evolution of visceral lesions which increased in number and size. They had not toxic effects. The general condition of the patient was very good, with KPS\u003d100. The brain metastases had no response to RCS. His surgical excision improved the neurological condition but, thereafter, general condition get worse and the patient died 3 months after surgical intervention. Biopsies from subcutaneous nodes and brain lesion sustained the malignant melanoma diagnosis.\nIn rare instances there are malignant melanoma metastases without a primary tumor. The patient was in a very good condition, although the treatment methods have not produced a regression of stabilization of the disease. The results of melanoma metastasis treatment are not satisfactory.","title":"[Multiple melanoma metastasis. Case report].","pubmedId":"20941984"}
