Gene mutations in the exons 20-26 which were mutational hotspots of ALK were analyzed by PCR-DNA direct sequencing.\nA novel synonymous mutation C3586T (Leu1196Leu) and a known synonymous mutation C3375A (Gly1125Gly) were found and located at exon 23 and exon 21 of ALK respectively. There were 10 cases (46%) of known synonymous mutation C3375A in 22 cases of NB. The C3375A allelic frequency was 27%. No statistically significant correlation was found between mutation C3375A and clinical parameters of NB such as age, sex, metastasis and tumor differentiation. Mutation was not found in the other 5 exons.\nA novel ALK gene synonymous mutation C3586T was identified using PCR-DNA sequencing. A known mutation C3375A in ALK was successfully identified in children, and its incidence is not influenced by the clinical features of childhood NB.","title":"[ALK gene mutations in childhood neuroblastoma].","pubmedId":"23092569"}
