Conservative management in cases of contusion or rupture of the testis has resulted in a 45 per cent failure rate and a 45 per cent orchiectomy rate when delayed exploration was required. Early exploration of patients with testicular trauma has resulted in only a 9 per cent orchiectomy rate, a shortened hospital stay, a greatly reduced period of disability and a faster return to normal activity.","title":"Testicular trauma.","pubmedId":"6834494"}
