We obtained a primary cell culture, characterized by cytogenetic study, through GTG- and CBG-banding techniques by using a mechanical dissection of a tumor sample obtained from an uveal melanoma. Cytogenetic analysis performed in the primary cell culture highlighted the presence of a structural rearrangement involving chromosomes 3 and 22. A t(3;22)(p13;p11) was observed as the only present clonal aberration. The 3p13 breakpoint involved in the aberration observed in our case could be essential in restricting the candidate region for the locus of an uveal melanoma tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 3.","title":"3p13 region: a possible location of a tumor suppressor gene involved in uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"9973930"}
