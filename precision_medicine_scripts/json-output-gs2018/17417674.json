The correct treatment of melanoma patients by the oncodermatologist and oncologist is based on the histopathological report containing the most important histological prognostic factors. However, the accurate interpretation of these factors may be difficult in the everyday practice, especially in reporting tumor thickness, the level of invasion, the type of exulceration and regression. It is important to standardize the content of the histopathological reports in a reproducible way.","title":"[Histopathological prognostic factors of malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"17417674"}
