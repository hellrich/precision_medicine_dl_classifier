Examination revealed a normal right eye. The left eye had hyperchromic heterochromia and an enlarged cornea (diameter, 13.0 mm) with intraocular pressure of 26 mm Hg. There were multiple areas of subconjunctival nodular pigmentation that extended posteriorly into the superior fornix. Fundus examination showed a large ciliochoroidal pigmented mass extending from 10:30 to 3:00 o\u0027clock position involving the superior half of the choroid and adjacent ciliary body. The eye was enucleated, confirming the diagnosis of diffuse uveal melanoma with extraocular extension. Systemic surveillance (hepatic panel and ultrasonography of the liver) performed every 6 months for 5 years was has been negative for metastases. The tumor was investigated intensively for the panel of genes (BAP1, BRAF, NRAS12, NRAS61, GNAQ, Kit 9,11,13,17,18) implicated in pathogenesis of blue nevus, cutaneous melanoma, and mucosal melanomas with negative results. Moreover, germline BAP1 mutation could not be identified. This case possibly represents as yet unidentified uveal melanocytic proliferation rather than a true variant of uveal melanoma.","title":"Congenital uveal melanoma?","pubmedId":"26277063"}
