There were 36 patients \u003c 55 years, 226 patients 55 to 69 years and 140 patients ≥ 70 years (range 44-78 years old). This study was conceptualized after the AUA released prostate cancer screening guidelines in which men ≥ 70 were deleted from screening.\nOverall, compared with patients \u003c 70 years old, we found that in patients ≥ 70 years old: 1) 60.7% had high GSS (7-10) (p \u003d 0.0234); 2) 39.3% had low GSS (6) (p \u003d 0.0234); 3) 31% had PSA level ≥ 10 ng/mL (p \u003d 0.0010) and 4) 69.1% had high GSS (7-10) in the presence of a positive DRE (p \u003d 0.0278).\nPatients ≥ 70 years old had a higher incidence of high GSS (7-10) compared to prostate cancer patients \u003c 70 years old. Patients ≥ 70 years old who also had a positive DRE had the highest incidence of high GSS.","title":"A comparative analysis of prostate cancer pre-treatment characteristics stratified by age.","pubmedId":"24775574"}
