Methods: MCF-7 cells were cultured in suspension to generate primary mammospheres. The inhibitory effects of epirubicin on MCF-7 mammosphere cells and the monolayer cells by were measured by MTT assay. The change of CD44+CD24- expression and cell cycle distribution in MCF-7 mammosphere cells and the monolayer cells under epirubicin condition was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: The cell inhibition was lower in MCF-7 mammosphere cells than that in the monolayer cells when induced by the same concentration of epirubicin (\u003e100 ng/ml),(P\u003c0.01). The CD44+CD24- expression was significantly higher in MCF-7 mammosphere cells than that in the monolayer cells under 400 ng/l epirubicin for 72 h, (22.8%  4.8% Vs 3.3%  0.8%),(P\u003c0.01). The cell cycle indicated that MCF-7 mammosphere cells had higher proportion of G0/G1 phase than the monolayer cells, (74.33%  3.20% Vs 53.40%  3.45%) (P\u003c0.01). Epirubicin had little effect on the G0/G1 phase of MCF-7 mammosphere cells and the monolayer cells, but the S phase and G2 phase was not the case. Conclusion: Epirubicin had lower inhibitory effects on MCF-7 mammosphere cells and it can be used to enrich breast cancer stem cell. Epirubicin had lower effect on the G0/G1 phase of MCF-7 mammosphere cells as compared with control.","title":"The comparison of epirubicin-treated MCF-7 mammosphere cells to the treated monolayer cells.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32860-65"}
