To discover the key target genes or pathways for the unfavorable subset in this patient group, we have analyzed 44 primary tumors (dead:24, alive:20) without MYCN amplification nor ALK alteration by integrated genomic analyses such as array CGH, gene expression profiling and whole exome sequencing (SureSelect 50Mb, average read depth:157, x20 coverage:95%). We found 816 non-synonymous somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in coding genes and alteration number in each tumor strongly associates with age at diagnosis (p\u003c0.0001) and patient prognosis (p \u003d 0.187). A novel ATRX mutation was identified in a tumor with 1p and 11q losses isolated from a male patient (age:93 months). Recurrent SNVs (n \u003d 2 to n \u003d 6) were found in 44 genes, 20 of those were involved only in the tumors from the patient with poor prognosis, in the 44 tumor set. Validation of these 20 SNVs is ongoing by using additional clinical samples. These features of genomic alterations could be useful for risk classification for each tumor and constructing new therapeutic strategies for aggressive neuroblastomas without MYCN amplification.","title":"Genomic characterization of aggressive subtype of neuroblastoma without MYCN amplification","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-77"}
