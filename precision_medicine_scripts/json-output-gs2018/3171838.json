The average age was 13.6 years (range, 22 months to 27 years). Our series includes papillary carcinoma in 11, follicular carcinoma in four, and medullary thyroid carcinoma in eight patients. Follow-up ranged from 8 months to 20.3 years, with an average of 7.5 years for well-differentiated carcinomas and 4.3 years for medullary thyroid carcinomas. All patients are presently alive with no evidence of progressive disease. Patients with papillary and follicular carcinomas underwent partial thyroidectomy; those with medullary carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy. Serious complications included three permanent hypoparathyroidism and two tracheostomies, all after secondary neck explorations. The overall results observed in our series of patients seem to support the current conservative approach to well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, reserving total thyroidectomy for medullary cancer of the thyroid. A more aggressive search for familial medullary carcinoma through use of pentagastrin stimulation leads to early detection and more effective therapy.","title":"A twenty-year experience with thyroid carcinoma in children.","pubmedId":"3171838"}
