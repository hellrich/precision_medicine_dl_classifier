{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Objective: To discuss the use of Grafix®, a commercially available, cryopreserved placental membrane, for the treatment of chronic/stalled wounds of different etiologies. Approach: To describe the unique composition of Grafix, to provide an overview of the existing clinical evidence supporting the benefits of Grafix for wound treatment, and to share the experience of the South Shore Hospital Center for Wound Healing (Weymouth, MA) with Grafix for the treatment of nonhealing wounds. Results: Clinical evidence supports the safety and efficacy of Grafix for the treatment of chronic/stalled wounds, including those that have failed other advanced treatment modalities. Innovation: Grafix is a cryopreserved placental membrane manufactured utilizing a novel technology that enables the preservation of all placental membrane components in their native state. Placental membranes have a unique composition of extracellular matrix, growth factors, and cells (including mesenchymal stem cells), which makes this tissue unique among other advanced biological wound treatment modalities. Conclusion: Clinical evidences support the benefits of Grafix for head-to-toe wound treatment.","title":"Grafix®, a Cryopreserved Placental Membrane, for the Treatment of Chronic/Stalled Wounds.","pubmedId":"26339532"}
