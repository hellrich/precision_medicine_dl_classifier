We report on a patient who was regularly examined in our clinic while participating in a randomized blinded clinical trial. The aim of this trial was to examine the effectiveness and tolerability of a combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor trametinib compared with a monotherapy with dabrafenib (plus placebo). During therapy the patient developed a diffuse neuroretinal detachment which could not be completely reversed after discontinuation of the study medication.","title":"[Development of serous retinopathy during therapy of a metastatic cutaneous melanoma].","pubmedId":"26873702"}
