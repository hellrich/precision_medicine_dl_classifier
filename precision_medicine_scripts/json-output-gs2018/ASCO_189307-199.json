Despite the high frequency of alterations, the biologic and therapeutic implications of Notch genomic alterations (GAs) in cSqCC are incompletely understood. Methods: 232 FFPE samples of cSqCC were evaluated by comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of 315 genes and analyzed for all classes of GAs, with diagnoses confirmed by central pathology review. Notch GAs with unknown functional impact were excluded. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was calculated from 1.11 Mb of sequenced DNA and reported as mutations/Mb. Results: The cohort of 232 samples was 78% male and 22% female, aged from 17 to 88, with confirmed metastatic disease in 32% of cases. 115 (50%) samples had a Notch family member GA with a known or predicted functional impact. 96 cases had Notch1 GAs, 43 cases had Notch2 GAs, and 14 cases had Notch3 GAs with 40 cases having GAs in multiple Notch family members. These mutations were 41% missense, 34% nonsense, 15% splice site, 9% frameshift indels, and 1% non-frameshift indels alterations. Patients with Notch GAs were significantly older (median 70 years old vs median 64, p \u003c 0.01). TMB was increased among samples with Notch GAs (median TMB of 63 mutations/mb versus 20 mutations/mb, p \u003c 1x10-6), with similar differences for primary and metastatic samples. Cases with Notch GAs had more total GAs per case (mean 10.4 vs 7.4, p \u003c 1.5x10-10); however, the top co-mutated genes were the same (TP53, CDKN2A, FAT1, MLL2). Both groups had a high proportion of C- \u003e T/G- \u003e A transitions, consistent with UV damage; however, the proportion was higher in cases with Notch GAs (median 83% vs 80%) - a difference seen in primary and metastatic samples. Conclusions: 50% of cSqCC cases had a Notch family member loss of function GA, which was associated with increased TMB in the primary and metastatic setting. With pre-clinical models and case studies showing responses to PD-1 inhibitors in cSqCC, further investigations are warranted into the associations of Notch GAs with mutational burden and response to immunotherapy.","title":"Association of tumor mutational burden in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with genomic alterations in Notch family receptors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_189307-199"}
