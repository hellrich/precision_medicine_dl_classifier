FGF signaling has been demonstrated to be altered in a high proportion of cancers, with activating mutations and/or overexpression of FGFRs frequently observed in lung, gastric, breast and urothelial tumors. Therefore, targeting FGFRs using selective FGFR inhibitors is an attractive therapeutic approach to treat cancer patients.BAY 1163877 is as an orally available, selective and potent inhibitor of FGFR-1, -2 and -3 kinase activity. BAY 1163877 has been advanced through preclinical development and we disclose here the first details of its preclinical profile.BAY 1163877 inhibited FGFR-1, -2, -3 kinase activity in the nanomolar range and demonstrated a kinase selectivity profile for FGFR-1, -2 and -3 over 222 kinases tested. BAY 1163877 inhibited proliferation of various cancer cell lines in vitro and phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules. BAY 1163877 was also tested in vivo in monotherapy and combination therapy on various human xenografts and syngeneic tumors and inhibited growth of tumors presenting at least one FGFR alteration.Overall, the in vitro and in vivo studies confirm that the FGFR inhibitor BAY 1163877 is a potent and selective inhibitor of altered FGFRs pathways in cancer models. A Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT01976741) has been initiated.","title":"Preclinical profile of BAY 1163877 - a selective pan-FGFR inhibitor in phase 1 clinical trial","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1739"}
