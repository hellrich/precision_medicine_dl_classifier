No data exist on the prognostic value of HPV and combined HPV/EGFR status in patients with locally advanced HNSCC (LAHNSCC) treated with radiotherapy and cetuximab. The HPV status defined by p16INK4A immunohistochemistry and PCR-based chip analysis was assessed in a clinically well-characterized cohort of patients with LAHNSCC. Outcome was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additionally, the EGFR expression levels and the effect of radioimmunotherapy in HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC cell lines were determined. 34% of the cases were p16INK4A/HPV positive. p16INK4A significantly correlated with male sex, younger patients and oropharnygeal localization and was a powerful predictor of OS (p\u003d0.001) and PFS (p0.001). The HRs for HPV+ tumors were 0.17 (95%CI: 0.056-0.524, p\u003d0.002) for OS and 0.12 (95%CI: 0.033-0.438, p\u003d0.001) for PFS. P16INK4A correlated well with the HPV status (p0.001). The HPV+ UD-SCC2 cells had higher EGFR levels when compared to HPV- FaDu cells and the efficacy of combined radioimmunotherapy was stronger. This is the first study that demonstrates the prognostic value of HPV in patients with LAHNSCC receiving cetuximab-based radioimmunotherapy.","title":"HPV status predicts therapy response in patients with locally advanced HNSCC receiving cetuximab-based radioimmunotherapy.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-2391"}
