Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for up to 85 % of all lung cancers. Multiple advances in the staging, diagnostic procedures, therapeutic options, as well as molecular knowledge have been achieved during the past years, although the overall outlook has not greatly changed for the majority of patients with the overall 5-year survival having marginally increased over the last decade from 15.7 to 17.4 % as reported by Howlader et al.
