We previously demonstrated that the isoform containing the extra domain B sequence of fibronectin (B-FN), a complete type-III-homology repeat, is a marker of angiogenesis that accumulates around neovasculature only during angiogenic processes. We produced a single-chain human recombinant antibody (scFv), L19, which reacts specifically with B-FN and selectively targets tumor vasculature in vivo. We used this scFv and an antibody against a pan-endothelial marker (Factor VIII) in a double-staining procedure on specimens of low- and high-grade astrocytomas to determine the percentage of B-FN-positive vessels, (denominating the resulting value angiogenic index [AI]). Compared to vascular density and proliferative activity (evaluated using antibodies to Factor VIII and Ki67, respectively), AI correlated better with tumor grade (1.6 +/- 2.6% and 92.0 +/- 8.7% of B-FN-positive vessels in low- and high-grade astrocytomas, respectively) and was a more precise diagnostic tool than either of the two conventional methods. In fact, discriminating analysis using these three parameters showed that only AI accurately classified 100% of the cases studied, compared to 64% and 89% correctly diagnosed by vascular density and of proliferating cells, respectively.","title":"Differentiation between high- and low-grade astrocytoma using a human recombinant antibody to the extra domain-B of fibronectin.","pubmedId":"12414516"}
