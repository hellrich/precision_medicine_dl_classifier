It is based on the combination of a photosensitizer that is selectively localized in the target tissue and illumination of the lesion with visible light, resulting in photodamage and subsequent cell death. For early esophageal cancer, esophagectomy has been a standard modality of curative intent. However, accumulated data supports the possibility of PDT replacing surgery as a curative modality. We experienced a case of early esophageal cancer that recurred after esophagectomy. The patient was successfully treated with photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium as a photosensitizer.","title":"[A case of photodynamic therapy for early esophageal cancer recurred after esophagectomy].","pubmedId":"17525522"}
