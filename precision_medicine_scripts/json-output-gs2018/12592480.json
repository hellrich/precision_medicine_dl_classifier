Malignant melanoma can develop in any part of the skin or mucosal membranes. It metastasizes to all organs of the body and often demonstrates unpredictable metastatic behavior. Late recurrence of malignant melanoma, defined as occurring 10 or more years after diagnosis and treatment, is a rare but characteristic metastatic behavior of malignant melanoma. We present a case of a late recurrence of malignant melanoma presenting with diffuse peritoneal studding.","title":"Late recurrence of malignant melanoma presenting as peritoneal \"carcinomatosis\".","pubmedId":"12592480"}
