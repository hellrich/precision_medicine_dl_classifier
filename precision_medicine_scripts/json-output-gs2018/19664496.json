In addition, there are cancer cell survival pathways that may not be the target of chromosomal translocations or mutations that are still estimable targets for new systemic therapeutics, be it pathways involved in angiogenesis or apoptosis. In this review, we examine target selection for specific sarcoma subtypes, and demonstrate with a few examples new techniques being used to delineate novel therapeutic inroads for patients with sarcoma.","title":"Other targetable sarcomas.","pubmedId":"19664496"}
