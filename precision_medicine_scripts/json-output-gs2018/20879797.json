Here, we have developed a natural glycoprotein microarray to discover serum autoantibodies to distinguish between patients with node negative melanoma and node positive melanoma. Dual-lectin affinity chromatography was used to extract glycoproteins from a melanoma cell line. Liquid-based reverse phase separation and microarray platforms were then applied to separate and spot these natural proteins on nitrocellulose slides. The serum autoantibodies were investigated by exposing these proteins to sera from 43 patients that have already been diagnosed to have different stages of early melanoma. The combination of 9 fractions provides a 55% sensitivity with 100% specificity for the detection of node positive against node negative and a 62% sensitivity with 100% specificity for the detection of node negative against node positive. Recombinant proteins were used to confirm the results using a sample set with 79 patients with diagnosed melanoma. The response of sera against recombinant 94 kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP94), acid ceramidase (ASAH1), cathepsin D (CTSD), and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) shared a similar pattern to the fractions where they were identified. The glycoarray platform provides a convenient and highly reproducible method to profile autoantibodies that could be used as serum biomarkers for prognosis of melanoma.","title":"Serum autoantibody profiling using a natural glycoprotein microarray for the prognosis of early melanoma.","pubmedId":"20879797"}
