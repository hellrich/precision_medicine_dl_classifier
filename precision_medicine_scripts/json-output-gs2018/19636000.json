The IDH1 mutation was inversely correlated with grade, affecting 77% of grade 2, 55% of grade 3, and 6% of grade 4 gliomas (P \u003c 10(-15)). The IDH1 mutation was tightly associated with a 1p19q codeleted genotype (P \u003c 10(-14)) and an MGMT methylated status (P \u003c .001) but mutually exclusive with EGFR amplification (P \u003c 10(-15)) and loss of chromosome 10 (P \u003c 10(-15)). The presence (v absence) of IDH1 mutation was associated with a better outcome in grade 2 (150.9 v 60.1 months, respectively; P \u003d .01), grade 3 (81.1 v 19.4 months, respectively; P \u003c .001), and grade 4 gliomas (27.4 v 14 months, respectively; P \u003c .01). After adjustment for grade, age, MGMT status, genomic profile, and treatment, multivariate analysis confirmed that IDH1 mutation was an independent favorable prognostic marker (hazard ratio \u003d 0.297; 95% CI, 0.157 to 0.564, P \u003d .00021).\nThis study indicates that IDH1 codon 132 mutation is closely linked to the genomic profile of the tumor and constitutes an important prognostic marker in grade 2 to 4 gliomas.","title":"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 codon 132 mutation is an important prognostic biomarker in gliomas.","pubmedId":"19636000"}
