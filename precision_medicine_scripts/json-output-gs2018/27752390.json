We report the results of the 2014 nationwide survey and compare them to those of the 1995, 1999, 2004, and 2009 surveys.\nFrom March 2015 to January 2016, a standardized case report form was sent to every member of the KGCA via e-mail. The survey consisted of 29 questions, regarding patient demographics as well as tumor-, and surgery-related factors. The completed data forms were analyzed by the KGCA information committee.\nData on 15,613 patients were collected from 69 institutions. The mean age was 60.9Â±12.1 years, and the proportion of patients more than 70 years of age increased from 9.1% in 1995 to 25.3% in 2014. Proximal cancer incidence steadily increased from 11.2% in 1995 to 16.0% in 2014. Early gastric cancer incidence consistently increased and accounted for 61.0% of all cases in 2014. The surgical approach was diversified in 2014, and 7,818 cases (50.1%) were treated with a minimally invasive approach. The most common anastomosis was Billroth I (50.2%) after distal gastrectomy, and the proportion of Roux-en-Y anastomoses performed increased to 8.6%.\nThe results of this survey are expected to be important data for future studies and to be useful for generating a national cancer control program.","title":"Korean Gastric Cancer Association Nationwide Survey on Gastric Cancer in 2014.","pubmedId":"27752390"}
