Its expression status in melanoma is currently unknown however, prompting us to examine this. Using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays containing a large set of melanocytic lesions (n\u003d539), we examined the expression profile of DLC1 in melanoma progression, as well as the association between DLC1 and patient survival. We detected both cytoplasmic and nuclear DLC1 expression, and found that whereas cytoplasmic DLC1 was significantly downregulated in metastatic melanoma compared with nevi and primary melanoma, nuclear DLC1 expression was significantly down in primary melanoma compared with nevi, and then further down in metastatic melanoma. Loss of cytoplasmic DLC1 was significantly associated with poorer overall and disease-specific 5-year survival rates of all melanoma (P\u003c0.001 and P\u003d0.001, respectively) and metastatic melanoma patients (P\u003d0.020 and 0.008, respectively), and similar results were seen for nuclear DLC1 (P\u003c0.001 for both overall and disease-specific survival for all melanoma patients, and P\u003d0.004 for metastatic melanoma patients). Next, we examined the correlation between cytoplasmic and nuclear DLC1 and found that concomitant loss of both forms was associated with the worst outcome for metastatic melanoma patients (P\u003d0.013 and P\u003d0.008 for overall and disease-specific 5-year survival, respectively). Finally, multivariate Cox regression analysis determined that strong cytoplasmic and nuclear DLC1 expression was a favorable independent prognostic factor for all melanoma (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.88; P\u003d0.008) and metastatic melanoma patients (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.23-0.77; P\u003d0.005). Although more research still needs to be done on the topic, these preliminary results support the hypothesis that DLC1 is a tumor suppressor in melanoma.
