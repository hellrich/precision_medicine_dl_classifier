Recently, chromosomal rearrangements involving c-ros oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) were identified, and patients seem to benefit from crizotinib treatment. The aim of this study was to identify the clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC with ROS1 expression and translocation.\nWe screened 1478 NSCLCs with a ROS1-specific antibody, and tested positive cases with FISH. All positive cases were analysed for associated clinicopathological characteristics, including survival and molecular tumour composition. Sixty-eight cases (4.6%) showed ROS1 immunoreactivity, and ROS1 translocations were confirmed in nine cases (0.6%). ROS1 expression was predominantly found in female adenocarcinoma patients, in patients with low T stages, and in association with TTF1 and napsin expression, and certain histomorphological adenocarcinoma patterns (lepidic, acinar, and solid). ROS1 translocations occurred in conjunction with other driver mutations (EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF). ROS1 expression was found to be a stage-independent predictor of favourable survival.\nROS1 translocations are rare events in resected NSCLCs from Caucasian patients. Immunohistochemical screening for ROS1 expression and clinicopathological parameters, including female sex, early tumour stages, adenocarcinomas with TTF1 and/or napsin expression, and a distinct histomorphological growth pattern, strongly facilitate case enrichment. Molecularly driven multistep concepts might not be optimal for case selection.","title":"ROS1 expression and translocations in non-small-cell lung cancer: clinicopathological analysis of 1478 cases.","pubmedId":"24456475"}
