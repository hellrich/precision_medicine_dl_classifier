Strong inverse correlation was found between the expression of P53 and bcl-2 (P \u003c 0.001). The P53 expression or the expression of both P53 and c-erbB-2 correlated with low histological grade, while the bcl-2 expression correlated with high histological grade (P \u003c 0.05). The necrosis in tumors with only bcl-2 expression was less than those with c-erbB-2 or both c-erbB-2 and P53 expression (P \u003c 0.02). Mitosis count was lower in tumors with only bcl-2 expression than those with expression of both c-erbB-2 and P53 (P \u003c 0.05). The expression of c-erbB-2 and P53 proteins are associated with poor prognosis (P \u003c 0.02, P \u003c 0.05) but not affected by bcl-2. The results suggest that bcl-2, P53 and c-erbB-2 are involved in tumorigenesis and development of breast carcinoma with different biological effects.","title":"[The expression of bcl-2, P53 and c-erbB-2 onco-proteins in breast cancer and their clinicopathological significance].","pubmedId":"9275673"}
