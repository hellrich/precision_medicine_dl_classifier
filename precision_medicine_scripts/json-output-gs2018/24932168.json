We describe a 42-year-old Japanese woman with amelanotic melanoma that comprised spindle cells with positive c-kit and S100A6 staining. The use of c-kit and S100A6 might be useful for improving the diagnosis. ","title":"S100A6 and c-Kit-Positive Spindle Cell Melanoma of the Dorsal Foot.","pubmedId":"24932168"}
