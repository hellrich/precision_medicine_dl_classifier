This is characterized by an increased detection of cases with minimal tumor burden (SUB-micrometastasis \u003c0.1 mm), which represents different biology.\nThe slides of positive SN from 3 major centers within the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Melanoma Group were reviewed and classified according to the Rotterdam Classification of SN Tumor Burden (\u003c0.1 mm; 0.1-1 mm; \u003e1 mm) maximum diameter of the largest metastasis. The predictive value for additional nodal metastases in the completion lymph node dissection (CLND) and disease outcome as disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was calculated.\nIn 388 SN positive patients, with primary melanoma, median Breslow thickness was 4.00 mm; ulceration was present in 56%. Forty patients (10%) had metastases \u003c0.1 mm. Additional nodal positivity was found in only 1 of 40 patients (3%). At a mean follow-up of 41 months, estimated OS at 5 years was 91% for metastasis \u003c0.1 mm, 61% for 0.1 to 1.0 mm, and 51% for \u003e1.0 mm (P \u003c 0.001). SN tumor burden increased significantly with tumor thickness. When the cut-off value for SUB-micrometastases was taken at \u003c0.2 mm (such as in breast cancer), the survival was 89%, and 10% had additional non-SN nodal positivity.\nThis large multicenter dataset establishes that patients with SUB-micrometastases \u003c0.1 mm have the same prognosis as SN negative patients and can be spared a CLND. A \u003c0.2 mm cut-off for SUB-micrometastases does not seem correct for melanoma, as 10% additional nodal positivity is found.","title":"Sentinel node tumor burden according to the Rotterdam criteria is the most important prognostic factor for survival in melanoma patients: a multicenter study in 388 patients with positive sentinel nodes.","pubmedId":"19092339"}
