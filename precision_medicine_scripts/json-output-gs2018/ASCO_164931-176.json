Several cardiac glycosides exhibited potent toxicity against melanomas. When combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib, synergistic effects on the survival of patient-derived melanoma xenograft models were observed. Based on these observations, we conducted a phase 1B study of digoxin plus trametinib in BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma patients. Methods: Seventeen BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma patients who were immunotherapy refractory (n \u003d 6) or ineligible for immunotherapy (11) were enrolled. Patients \u003e 18 year old with good performance status and organ function received 8 week cycles of daily digoxin 0.25 mg oral daily adjusted for serum level of 1-2ng/mL and trametinib 2mg oral daily adjusted for side effects. Toxicities were measured by histories, exams and labs using NCI CTCAE v4.1, and responses assessed with exams and CT scans employing RECIST v1.1. Results: Seventeen patients are evaluable for toxicities. 16/17 had grade 1-2 rash, diarrhea, and/or fatigue. Four of the first seven patients discontinued therapy secondary to these side effects. After institution of early patient education and symptomatic interventions, no further patients stopped therapy early. Of sixteen assessable patients for responses, there were 4 partial remissions--PR (25%, 95% CI \u003d 7.3%-52.4%) lasting 2, 2, 4 and 8 months and six stable disease--SD (38%, 95% CI \u003d 15.2%-64.6%) lasting 2, 2, 2+, 8+ and 7 months. The disease control rateDCR composed of PRs + SDs was 10/16 or 63% (95% CI \u003d 35.4%-84.8%) with median duration of 4+ months. The DCR in NRAS mutant melanoma patients was 4/5 or 80% compared with 5/10 or 50% in NRAS wild-type patients. Conclusions: These results compare favorably with the published activity of trametinib alone in BRAF wild-type melanoma patients where the PR and DCR rates were 10% and 36%, respectively (n \u003d 39, Falchook, Lancet Oncology 13, 782, 2012). Trametinib alone yielded a DCR of 2/7 or 29% in NRAS mutant melanoma patients. Further patient accrual is warranted in an expansion cohort of digoxin + trametinib in BRAF wild-type and NRAS mutant melanoma patients.
