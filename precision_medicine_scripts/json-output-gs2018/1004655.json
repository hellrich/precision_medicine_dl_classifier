Despite the focused publicity given to problems relating to m.m., faulty nonradical excisions of suspected pigmented lesions are still performed rather frequently in surgical outpatient departments. One of the reasons may be the rather difficult clinical diagnosis due to pleiomorphism of m.m., but a lack of experience of certain physicians is also responsible. The authors indicate what effective course to pursue in these patients. On the evidence of their set of 48 patients operated upon, they have shown a radical reexcision of the scar with its wide vicinity, following a nonradical intervention, to be justified. In certain cases, it may affect an eventful dissemination of tumorous cases, it may affect an eventual dissemination of tumorous cells in the close vicinity of the scar after an inadequate excision. In addition, they have delimitated indications valid for a radical reexcision.","title":"On surgical treatment of malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"1004655"}
