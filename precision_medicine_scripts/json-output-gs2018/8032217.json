The frequency of aneuploidy was significantly higher in metastases than in the primary tumour (p \u003d 0.009), suggesting a higher growth potential in melanoma metastases than in the primary tumours. In 18 patients with reliable S-phase determinations from both primary tumour and metastasis there was no significant difference in mean S-phase fraction between primary melanomas and metastases. Skin metastases localized in dermis and subcutis had a significantly (p \u003d 0.012) higher mean S-phase fraction than lymph node metastases.","title":"DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction in primary melanomas and their regional metastases.","pubmedId":"8032217"}
