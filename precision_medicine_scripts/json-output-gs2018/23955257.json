EGFR alteration was associated with older age (P \u003d 0.021), intestinal type (P \u003d 0.040) and higher stage disease (P \u003c 0.001). The patients with operable state gastric cancer who had EGFR alteration had an unfavorable prognosis, and multivariate analysis confirmed that EGFR alteration was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor. Twenty-seven cases (10.6 %) showed HER-2 alteration by IHC or SISH. HER-2 alteration was associated with older age (P \u003d 0.006), well or moderately differentiated histology (P \u003c 0.001) and intestinal type (P \u003d 0.002).\nHER-2 alteration is not an independent prognostic factor for curatively resectable gastric cancer. We observed EGFR alteration in a subset of cases with operable state gastric cancer and determined that it was associated with an unfavorable prognosis.","title":"Prognostic implications of EGFR and HER-2 alteration assessed by immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization in gastric cancer patients following curative resection.","pubmedId":"23955257"}
