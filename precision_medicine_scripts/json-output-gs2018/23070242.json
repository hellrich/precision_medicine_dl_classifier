Recently, clinicopathologic characteristics of c-ros oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1)-rearranged NSCLC patients have been described. Furthermore, anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor, novel class of drugs targeting this tyrosine kinase receptor is currently under clinical trial in this molecular subset of NSCLC patients. This review will focus on the current knowledge of ROS1 rearrangements in NSCLC, methods to detect ROS1 rearrangement, and targeting ROS1-rearranged NSCLC patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors.","title":"Targeting ROS1 with anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors: a promising therapeutic strategy for a newly defined molecular subset of non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23070242"}
