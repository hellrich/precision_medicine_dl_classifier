In young patients at risk of genetically determined MTC, the key to a good outcome is an appropriate first operation, and this will depend upon the codon mutation, patient age, calcitonin level and disease extent at presentation. When MTC has already developed, a therapeutic intervention is required.\nThe thyroid, pituitary, adrenal, parathyroid and pancreatic components of MEN-1 and -2 require close collaboration of a specialist and experienced multidisciplinary team.","title":"Endocrine surgical aspects of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes in children.","pubmedId":"18174722"}
