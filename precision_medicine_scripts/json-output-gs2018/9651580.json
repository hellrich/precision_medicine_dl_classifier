We have investigated the enzymatic activities of the purified proteins and found that Mre11 by itself has 3\u0027 to 5\u0027 exonuclease activity that is increased when Mre11 is in a complex with Rad50. Mre11 also exhibits endonuclease activity, as shown by the asymmetric opening of DNA hairpin loops. In conjunction with a DNA ligase, Mre11 promotes the joining of noncomplementary ends in vitro by utilizing short homologies near the ends of the DNA fragments. Sequence identities of 1-5 base pairs are present at all of these junctions, and their diversity is consistent with the products of nonhomologous end-joining observed in vivo.","title":"The 3\u0027 to 5\u0027 exonuclease activity of Mre 11 facilitates repair of DNA double-strand breaks.","pubmedId":"9651580"}
