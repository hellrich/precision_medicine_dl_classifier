Although melanoma cells often retain wild-type p53 tumour suppressor protein and express it at high levels, the p53 mediated apoptosis pathway is suppressed. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a promising group of compounds inducing differentiation, growth arrest and apoptosis in tumour cells in preclinical studies. We have studied the cellular effects of trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC inhibitor, in a panel of melanoma cell lines and its mechanism of action in relation to p53. TSA stabilized wild-type p53, but p53 protein accumulation was overridden by simultaneous downregulation of p53 mRNA leading to a decrease in p53 protein. While growth arrest was induced in all cell lines studied and apoptosis in most (6/7), these cellular effects were independent of the p53 status of the cells. Inhibiting p53 function by a dominant negative p53 (p53(175His)) confirmed that the HDAC inhibitor induced apoptosis was independent of wild-type p53, even though TSA slightly activated p53 in a reporter assay. The results indicate that while the action of TSA is independent of p53, the activation of the apoptosis pathway by the HDAC inhibitors may provide therapeutic approaches for melanoma treatment.","title":"Melanoma cell lines are susceptible to histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA provoked cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.","pubmedId":"15892716"}
