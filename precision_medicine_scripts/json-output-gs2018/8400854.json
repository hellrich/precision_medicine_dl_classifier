Cytogenetic analyses were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes, in order to exclude the presence of constitutional chromosomal aberrations, and on primary cell cultures obtained from neoplastic skin lesions. A metastasis was also cultured in order to characterize chromosome markers. Specific markers found in more than one patient were t(1;14)(q21;q32) and aberrations of the 4q21,8q24 and 10q24q26 regions. The research aims to identify possible subtypes of melanomas related to specific chromosomal markers. It is hoped that this will contribute to understanding of the aetiology and evolution of the disease in order to obtain a more exact classification. We compare our results with the data reported in the literature and discuss the possible role of the cytogenetic analyses in human malignant melanoma.","title":"Cytogenetic findings in 20 melanomas.","pubmedId":"8400854"}
