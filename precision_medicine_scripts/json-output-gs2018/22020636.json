Overall, 52 (30%) patients had IDH gene alterations. There was no association with complete response (CR), remission duration, overall survival, and event-free survival and any of the IDH alterations, and no association with a higher CR rate or survival with the 4 regimens for the 52 patients with aberrant IDH. Among the patients with diploid karyotype and NPM1(mut) FLT3(WT) genotype, those with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations had an inferior outcome.\nIDH aberrations and IDH1 codon 105 SNP occur in about 30% of younger patients with AML, mostly with diploid karyotype. Using high-dose ara-C-based induction regimens, we did not detect an association with outcome for any of the aberrations.","title":"Prognostic significance of alterations in IDH enzyme isoforms in patients with AML treated with high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin.","pubmedId":"22020636"}
