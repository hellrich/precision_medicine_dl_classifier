We also examined the role of metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 in the proliferation and apoptosis in adenoid cystic carcinoma.\nMetastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 expression was analysed in 65 paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma and 25 adjacent non-cancerous tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We used RNA interference technology to silence metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 expression in ACCM cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 tests, transwell experiments and flow cytometry were used to test the proliferation, cisplatin resistance, migration, invasion and apoptosis of ACCM cells.\nMetastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 nuclear and cytoplasmic expression in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma tissue was higher than in the adjacent normal salivary tissue. The expression level was closely associated with tumour histological grading, perineural invasion and surrounding tumour invasion. The downregulation of metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 expression inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in ACCM cells. The knock-down of metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 expression had no effect on migration, invasion and chemoresistance.\nMetastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 may have an important role in tumour development in adenoid cystic carcinoma. Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 is a potential biomarker for adenoid cystic carcinoma.","title":"The expression of MACC1 and its role in the proliferation and apoptosis of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25640194"}
