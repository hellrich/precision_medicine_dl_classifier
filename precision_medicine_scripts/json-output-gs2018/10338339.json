We present the results from the patients diagnosed and treated in our dermatological department at Ullevaal Hospital. During the study period 4582 patients received a clinical evaluation of pigmented lesions and 1347 patients were included in follow-up analyses, which consisted of a complete anamnestical evaluation and a clinical and pathological investigation of excised pigmented lesions. In all, 66 cutaneous malignant melanomas, 50 superficial spreading melanomas, seven lentigo maligna melanomas, eight nodular melanomas and one acral lentiginous melanoma were diagnosed. Correlation of the clinical and anamnestical information demonstrated an increased risk of developing malignant melanoma in persons with red hair and skin type I/II. When the histological thickness of superficial spreading melanomas diagnosed before the start of the project was compared with that of those treated during the project, there was a significant decrease in thickness in the project period.","title":"Cutaneous malignant melanoma in Norway: experiences from the Norwegian Melanoma Project.","pubmedId":"10338339"}
