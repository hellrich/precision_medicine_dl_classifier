We analysed site-specific melanoma incidence during the period 1982-2001 in Queensland, Australia (n\u003d28 862 invasive melanomas; 2536 lentigo maligna melanomas) and the west of Scotland (n\u003d4278 invasive melanomas; 525 lentigo maligna melanomas). Analyses were stratified by sex and age group (\u003c40 years, 40-59 years, \u003e/\u003d60 years). We estimated annual percentage change (APC) in melanoma incidence by regressing the logarithms of the rates and exponentiating the coefficients. Among men, overall melanoma incidence increased log-linearly in both settings, but significantly more rapidly in the west of Scotland (APC 2.8%) than Queensland (APC 1.4%). Rates of increase among Scottish men were higher for every body site and all ages than among Queensland men. Among women, overall melanoma incidence increased more rapidly among Scottish (APC 1.8%) than Queensland women (APC 0.7%). Most discrepant were trends in upper limb melanomas, which underwent large annual increases among Scottish women, but declined among younger Queensland women. Melanoma incidence continues to rise rapidly in all age groups in Scotland and among older people in Queensland. Rates of melanoma in younger people in Queensland are stabilizing, as might be expected if primary prevention campaigns were effective in reducing solar exposure. Variations in rates of change at different body sites warrant further monitoring.","title":"Changes in the incidence of cutaneous melanoma in the west of Scotland and Queensland, Australia: hope for health promotion?","pubmedId":"18414196"}
