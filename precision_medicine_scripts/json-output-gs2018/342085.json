A complete postmortem examination revealed multiple metastases in the liver, and eliminated the possibility of an extraneural primary melanoma. A review of the literature confirmed that such cases are highly exceptional, and that an exhaustive autopsy including particularly the eyes is indispensable to substantiate the diagnosis. When these conditions are fulfilled, there is no reason not to consider the eventuality of visceral deposits from a primary melanoma of the central nervous system.","title":"Primary malignant melanoma of the cerebellum: a case with metastases outside the nervous system.","pubmedId":"342085"}
