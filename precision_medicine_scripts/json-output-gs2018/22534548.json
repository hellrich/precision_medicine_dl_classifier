We investigate the potential association between epidermal growth factor and its receptor gene polymorphisms with gastric cancer in a Chinese Han population.\nPolymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism strategies were used to genotype EGF +61 G/A and EGFR+2073 A/T in 207 gastric cancer cases and 318 healthy controls.\nThe A allele of EGF +61 G/A was less frequently in gastric cancer patients than in controls(OR\u003d0.73, 95%CI\u003d0.55-0.95, p\u003d0.02). The A allele frequency was also associated with deeper tumor invasion(OR\u003d1.74, 95%CI\u003d1.05-2.89, p\u003d0.03), increased lymph node metastasis (OR\u003d1.74, 95%CI\u003d1.08-2.82, p\u003d0.02)and shorter survival time (95%CI\u003d9.27-16.72, p\u003d0.038).A T allele frequency in the EGFR +2073 A/T polymorphism was associated with increased lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer (OR\u003d1.62, 95%CI\u003d1.06-2.47,p\u003d0.03).\nOur results suggest that the A allele of EGF +61 G/A polymorphism decreases the risk of gastric cancer. However, the presence of either the A allele of EGF +61 G/A or the EGFR +2073 T allele indicated a poor prognosis for gastric cancer patients.","title":"An association between EGF and EGFR gene polymorphisms with gastric cancer in a Chinese Han population.","pubmedId":"22534548"}
