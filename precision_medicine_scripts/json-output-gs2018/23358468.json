EGFR targeted therapies are in widespread clinical use in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and other tumor types. Despite the clinical success of EGFR targeted therapy, resistance to treatment is a significant barrier to the optimized use of EGFR inhibitors to cure patients with lung and other cancers. Here, we review established and emerging mechanisms of resistance to EGFR targeted therapy and highlight strategies that could overcome treatment resistance and therefore enhance clinical outcomes.","title":"Mechanisms of resistance to EGFR targeted therapies.","pubmedId":"23358468"}
