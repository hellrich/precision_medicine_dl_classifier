New target therapies have been already commercialized and studied along with the recent discovery of gene rearrangement involved in the carcinogenic process of non-small cell lung cancer. This study aims to investigate anplastic lymphoma kinase, c-ros oncogene 1, and receptor tyrosine kinase, in particular.
