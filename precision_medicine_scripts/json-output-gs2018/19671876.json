In this study, we investigated the prognostic values of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and other angiogenesis-related gene expressions, as well as their interrelationships.\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were obtained from 45 patients with soft tissue sarcoma (median age 57 years, range 16-85 years). After laser capture microdissection direct quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (TaqMan) assays were done in triplicates to determine HIF1a, HB-EGF, VEGF, and other gene expression levels.\nMultivariate Cox [corrected] regression analysis revealed significant independent associations of HB-EGF, HIF1a, and VEGF-C gene expression to the overall survival (P \u003c 0.0001). A combined factor of these three genes showed a relative risk for shorter survival of 5.5, more than twice higher as in an increasing International Union against Cancer Stage. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a significant sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 82% of this factor for the diagnosis of short (\u003c3 years) versus long (3-9 years) survival (P \u003d 0.0002). VEGF-A showed significant gender differences in the association to survival.\nMeasuring HIF1a, HB-EGF, and VEGF-C expression may contribute to a better understanding of the prognosis of patients with soft tissue sarcoma and may even play a crucial role for the distribution of patients to multimodal therapeutic regimens. Prospective studies investigating the response to different adjuvant or palliative therapies seem to be warranted.","title":"A three-gene signature for outcome in soft tissue sarcoma.","pubmedId":"19671876"}
