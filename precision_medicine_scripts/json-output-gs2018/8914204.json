Laboratory investigations have demonstrated that both animal and human melanomas may respond to changes in the hormonal milieu. Steroid hormone binding activity has been demonstrated in some human melanomas, but only a small percentage of melanomas respond to hormonal manipulation. Randomized trials suggest a possible role for tamoxifen in combination with chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma and for megestrol acetate as an adjuvant. Nevertheless, it appears that the use of steroid hormones in the management of melanoma is limited.","title":"Endocrinology of melanoma.","pubmedId":"8914204"}
