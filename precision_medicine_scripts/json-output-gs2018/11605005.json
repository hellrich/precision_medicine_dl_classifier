We describe here a newly established cell line, OCUM-6, derived from ascites effusion of a scirrhous gastric cancer patient. The cells are floating and round shape, similar to other scirrhous gastric carcinoma cell lines previously reported. Histologic findings of xenografted tumor obtained from OCUM-6 cells showed medullary growth with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma containing signet ring cells. LOH at E-cadherin locus 16q22 was observed in the OCUM-6 cells. LOH at E-cadherin locus might be closely associated with histologic findings and metastatic process of scirrhous gastric cancer. The scirrhous gastric cancer cell line, OCUM-6, may be useful for investigation of the mechanisms of peritoneal dissemination and carcinogenesis.","title":"Establishment of a new scirrhous gastric cancer cell line with loss of heterozygosity at E-cadherin locus.","pubmedId":"11605005"}
