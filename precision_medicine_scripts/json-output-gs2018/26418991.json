METHODS Combined bone marrow cytology, fluorescence in situ hybridization, fusion gene detection was used to analyze the patient. RESULTS Clinically, the patient had many features similar to those with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, which included hyperleukocytosis, marked eosinophilia, monocytosis, myeloid hyperplasia and hyperplasia. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for FGFR1 gene rearrangement was positive. Further study of the mRNA also confirmed an in-frame fusion between exon 38 of the CEP110 gene and exon 9 of FGFR1 gene. CONCLUSION EMS with CEP110-FGFR1 fusion is a very rare and distinct myeloproliferative neoplasm. FISH and molecular studies may improve its diagnosis.
