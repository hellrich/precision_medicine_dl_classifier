In this study, we show that expression of FOP-FGFR1 in primary bone marrow cells induced by retroviral transduction generates a MPD in mice. Constitutive FOP-FGFR1 kinase activity was both essential and sufficient to cause a chronic myeloproliferative syndrome in the murine bone marrow transplantation model. In contrast to the human disorder, lymphoproliferation and progression to acute phase were not observed. Lymphoid symptoms, however, appeared when onset of the disease was delayed as the result of mutation of FOP-FGFR1 at tyrosine 511, the phospholipase C gamma (PLCgamma) binding site.","title":"FOP-FGFR1 tyrosine kinase, the product of a t(6;8) translocation, induces a fatal myeloproliferative disease in mice.","pubmedId":"12969958"}
