Hospitals with low response rates to the questionnaire reported less assault, yet the violence admitted to was described as more deadly. More nurses at public than private hospitals had obtained some training to handle potentially violent situations. Serious assault was negatively related to amount of training. At the public psychiatric hospital, violent acts were most frequent, but the rate of deadly violence (e.g., rape, use of knives or guns, etc.) was lowest. The need to train staffs at general as well as psychiatric hospitals was discussed.","title":"Hospital violence: site, severity, and nurses\u0027 preventive training.","pubmedId":"1478861"}
