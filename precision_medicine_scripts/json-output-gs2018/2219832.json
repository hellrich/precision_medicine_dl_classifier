Inheritable and non-inheritable forms of skin melanoma were identified. The inheritable tumor group included familial disease (2%) and tumors developing against the background of hereditary diseases and syndromes (32.7%). The data obtained served as basis for the identification of families with high genetic predisposition to skin melanoma development and for the assessment of individual risk of the disease in patients\u0027 relatives.","title":"[Melanoma of the skin: clinico-genetic studies].","pubmedId":"2219832"}
