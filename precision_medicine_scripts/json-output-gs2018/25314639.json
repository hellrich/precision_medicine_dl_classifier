Forty-three specimens [27 of which (62.8%) were BRAF V600E-positive] were available. CD3(+) tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were evident in 33 specimens (76.7%), CD8(+) in 39 (90.7%), CD45RO(+) in 32 (74.4%), PD-1(+) in 27 (62.8%), FoxP3(+) in 21 (48.8%) and CD20(+) TILs in 19 (44.2%). Tumour PD-L1 expression was observed in 22 specimens (51.1%), and in nine of these (40.9%) expression was observed in more than 5% of tumour cells. PD-L1 expression was associated with higher density of PD-1(+) (P \u003c 0.001), CD3(+) (P \u003d 0.014) and FoxP3(+) (P \u003c 0.001) TIL infiltration. Density of CD3(+) TILs was associated with density of CD8(+) (P \u003c 0.001), PD-1(+) (P \u003c 0.001) and CD45RO(+) (P \u003c 0.001) TILs. PD-L1 expression or PD-1(+) , CD3(+) , CD8(+) or CD45RO(+) TILs density did not correlate with BRAF V600E status, previous systemic therapy or survival (P \u003e 0.05).\nMelanoma BM showed considerable lymphocytic infiltrates and expression of PD-L1 in the majority of investigated specimens, with high PD-L1 expression found predominantly in regions of abundant inflammation. Our data indicate that clinical studies should investigate the value of checkpoint inhibitors in patients with melanoma BMs.","title":"Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in melanoma brain metastases.","pubmedId":"25314639"}
