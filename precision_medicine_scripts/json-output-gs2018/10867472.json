The occurrence of this tumor in the biliary tree is extremely rare.\nTwo patients are described presenting with biliary obstruction due to a tumor at the hepatic duct confluence. One patient is a 38-year-old white male with concomitant cutaneous granular cell tumors, and the other a 50-year-old white female.\nHilar excision was performed in both patients. Histopathology of the tumors revealed a proliferation of cells with granular cytoplasm, diagnosed as granular cell tumor.\nAt preoperative examination, hilar granular cell tumors are difficult to differentiate from cholangiocarcinoma, sclerosing cholangitis or more common benign biliary tumors. Treatment consists of surgical excision after which prognosis is favorable.","title":"Granular cell tumor at the hepatic duct confluence mimicking Klatskin tumor.
