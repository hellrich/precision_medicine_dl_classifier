Surgery was the only effective definitive therapy, and only palliative methods could be used for half of those patients with posterior tumors. A good prognosis was possible if primary treatment controlled the malignant process, but all patients in whom tumor recurred locally eventually died of their disease.","title":"Primary carcinoma of the male urethra.","pubmedId":"7403907"}
