We report a patient with ciliary body melanoma associated with nodular extrascleral extension and diffuse infiltration of the iris and angle treated conservatively because the fellow eye was blind.\nThe clinical features and surgical management of a melanoma of the ciliary body with extrascleral extension and diffuse infiltration of the iris and angle are presented. The tumor was treated with focal I-125 plaque radiotherapy followed by supplemental whole anterior segment I-125 plaque radiotherapy.\nThe patient has been followed for over 2.5 years since the initial plaque radiotherapy and over 1.5 years since the supplemental whole anterior segment radiotherapy. His visual acuity is correctable to 20/40 OD and there is no evidence of metastatic disease. His glaucoma is well controlled following trabeculectomy and tube shunt procedure.\nWhole anterior segment plaque radiotherapy for ciliary body melanoma with diffuse iris-angle infiltration provided palliative local tumor control without significant local complications through available follow-up.","title":"Ciliary body melanoma with limited nodular extrascleral extension and diffuse iris-angle infiltration treated by whole anterior segment plaque radiotherapy.","pubmedId":"17468833"}
