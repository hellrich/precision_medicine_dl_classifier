We report a patient with a BRAF V600E mutated pilomyxoid astrocytoma who failed multiple conventional chemotherapy regimens. Treatment with vemurafenib, a molecularly targeted therapy against the mutant BRAF V600E kinase, combined with vinblastine resulted in tumor regression. Furthermore, this patient experienced almost immediate progression of disease after holding vemurafenib for only 2-3 weeks, suggesting that the tumor response is vemurafenib dependent. This population of patients may benefit from targeted therapy and testing of individual tumors for BRAF mutations is justified.","title":"Pilomyxoid astrocytoma treated successfully with vemurafenib.","pubmedId":"24821190"}
