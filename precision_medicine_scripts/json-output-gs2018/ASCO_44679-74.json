Much interest has been focused recently on its members because of their role in breast carcinogenesis. We have evaluated 181 cases of invasive breast cancer immunohistochemicaly to examine the expression of all four EGFR family receptor proteins.The aim of this study was to clarify the prognostic value of these biomarkers in BC as well as to define their relationships with the existing clinicopathological features. Methods: Formalin fixed parraffin embedded samples from 181 patients diagnosed with BC from Sep 2002 to Sep 2003 at Clinical Hospital Center Zagreb, Croatia were examined retrospectively. Samples were stained for EGFR, c-erbB-2, c-erbB-3 and c-erb B-4 by immunohistochemistry.The clinical data included patients demographics such as age and race, tumor characteristics including tumor size, histological tumor type and grade, vascular invasion, Ki-67,lymph node stage, time at type of recurrence, time and status of last follow up. Suvival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Association between immunohistochemical findings and other variables were calculated using Spearmans rank correlation test and point-biserial correlation coefficient. Results: Expression of ERGF, erb-2,3,4 was observed in 20.6%, 18.2%, 29.5% and 5.7% respectively. There was significant association between EGFR overexpression and larger tumor (r\u003d.18, p\u003c 0.05), higher grade (r\u003d.23, p\u003c 0.01), more positive nodes (r\u003d.17, p\u003c 0.05), higer Ki-67 (r\u003d.26, p\u003c 0.01). Similar results were obtained for c-erbB-2 overexpression, while no such association existed for c-erbB-3 and e-erbB-4 family members. Tumors overexpressing EGFR and c-erbB-2 had worse 5-years DFS compared to c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4 tumors (56%, 61%, 78%, 70% respectively). Conclusions: This study shows that tumors overexpressing EGFR and c-erbB-2 are associated with worse clinicopathological features and have significant increase in recurrence. No such association was found for c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4. EGFR overexpression could provide additional information to perform risk stratification of early breast cancer patients.","title":"Prognostic value of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_44679-74"}
