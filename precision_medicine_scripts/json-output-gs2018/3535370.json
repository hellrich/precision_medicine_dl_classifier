SQM1 antibody stained selectively squamous carcinoma, while normal mucosa and cells of the stroma were non-reactive. Positive staining of tumor was found in 33/35 specimens obtained from several major sites of the head and neck area and was observed in primary manifestations and lymph node metastases as well as in recurrences. The most consistent reactivity was seen with carcinomas of the tongue. Well differentiated squamous carcinomas contained a higher proportion of SQM1 positive tumor cells than poorly differentiated carcinomas. We suggest that the SQM1 antibody may aid in the immunohistochemical identification of squamous carcinoma of the head and neck area.","title":"Immunohistochemical identification of squamous carcinoma of the head and neck with monoclonal antibody SQM1.","pubmedId":"3535370"}
