We report a 4-year-old male who developed HS during maintenance chemotherapy for precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL). Both tumors showed identical clonal immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene re-arrangement patterns, as well as homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A gene encoding p16(INK4A). These data suggest a clonal relationship between the two neoplasms despite their distinct lineages. Since CDKN2A deletion predisposes to development of HS in experimental models, the cytogenetic features of the patient\u0027s pre-B ALL may have predisposed to this change in lineage.","title":"Pediatric histiocytic sarcoma clonally related to precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with homozygous deletion of CDKN2A encoding p16INK4A.","pubmedId":"20973102"}
