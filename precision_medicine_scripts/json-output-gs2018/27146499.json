These mutations can be BRAF activating without being addressable by an approved BRAF inhibitor. The case of a patient with fulminant metastatic melanoma and a BRAF(L597Q) mutation is presented. It is demonstrated that the tumor shows an excellent response to the MEK inhibitor trametinib. This is an example for possible targeted therapy in a non-V600-mutated melanoma resulting in a 17-month overall survival.
