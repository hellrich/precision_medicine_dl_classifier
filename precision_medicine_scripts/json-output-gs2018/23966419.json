RET/PTC rearrangements are the most frequent genetic alterations associated with radiation-induced PTC, whereas BRAF and RAS mutations and PAX8-PPARG rearrangement have been associated with sporadic PTC. We decided to search for such genetic alterations in PTCs of patients subjected in childhood to scalp irradiation.\nWe studied 67 thyroid tumors from 49 individuals irradiated in childhood for tinea capitis scalp epilation: 36 malignant (12 cases of conventional PTC (cPTC), two cPTC metastases, 20 cases of follicular variant PTC (FVPTC), one oncocytic variant of PTC and one follicular carcinoma) and 31 follicular thyroid adenomas.\nThe lesions were screened for the BRAF(V600E) and NRAS mutations and for RET/PTC and PAX8-PPARG rearrangements.\nBRAF(V600E) mutation was detected in seven of 14 (50%) cPTC and two of 20 FVPTC (10%) (P\u003d0.019). NRAS mutation was present in one case of FVPTC (5%). RET/PTC1 rearrangement was found, by RT-PCR, in one of 17 cases (5.9%) and by fluorescence in situ hybridization in two of six cases (33%). PAX8-PPARG rearrangement was not detected in any carcinoma. None of the follicular adenomas presented any of the aforementioned genetic alterations.\nThe prevalence of BRAF(V600E) mutation in our series is the highest reported in series of PTCs arising in radiation-exposed individuals. The prevalence of RET/PTC1 rearrangement fits with the values recently described in a similar setting.","title":"Genetic alterations in thyroid tumors from patients irradiated in childhood for tinea capitis treatment.","pubmedId":"23966419"}
