Dasatinib, a Bcr-abl and Src in hibitor, has been approved clinically for CML and shown activities against solid tumors in vitro. In our recent work, degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a role in dasatinib-induced apoptosis in HNSCC cells. We further revealed the role of metabolic stress in dasatinib-induced EGFR degradation and apoptosis. Dasatinib decreased cellular ATP, and activated AMPK activation and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) as well. Inhibition or knockdown of AMPK reversed dasatinib-induced EGFR degradation, and pharmacological activation of AMPK led to ER stress and EGFR degradation. Addition of ER stress inhibitor to dasatinib reversed EGFR degradation and apoptosis, and pharmacologic activation of ER stress resulted in EGFR degradation. In conclusion, metabolic stress may play a role in dasatinib-induced EGFR degradation and apoptosis in HNSCC cells.","title":"Metabolic stress played a role in dasatinib-induced EGFR degradation and apoptosis in head and neck cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-5404"}
