We describe the clinical and laboratory features of a 13-year-old male with congenital agranulocytosis, treated with G-CSF with initial good neutrophil response, who subsequently developed acute myeloid leukemia. This rare complication may define a preleukemic subset of patients for whom G-CSF therapy is ineffective. The diagnostic challenges of this case are presented.","title":"Terminal acute myelogenous leukemia in a patient with congenital agranulocytosis.","pubmedId":"8342541"}
