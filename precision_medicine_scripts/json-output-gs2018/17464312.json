The T1799A missense mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene and RET/PTC rearrangement have been identified as the dominant genetic tumour initiation events in the pathogenesis of PTC leading to a constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway. In order to elucidate the pathogenesis of diffuse sclerosing variant of PTC, the prevalence of BRAF mutation and RET/PTC were determined by RT-polymerase chain reaction and DNA-sequence analysis in tumour samples of seven patients with this variant (all female, age range 15-61 years, mean 33.3 years) without prior radiation exposure. None of these cases showed a BRAF mutation. RET/PTC1 (two out of seven) and RET/PTC3 (one out of seven), which have been shown in large PTC series to comprise together more than 90% of RET/PTC types, were found in \u003c50% of the cases investigated. All seven samples expressed the RET tyrosine kinase domain but lacked its extracellular domain potentially suggesting the existence of rare types of RET/PTC rearrangement in the four remained cases of diffuse sclerosing variant of PTC. Regarding this subtype, our study confirmed the paradigm of a mutual exclusivity between RET/PTC and BRAF in PTC. Additionally, this rare variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma may represent a tumour type susceptible to RET-targeted therapies.","title":"Diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: lack of BRAF mutation but occurrence of RET/PTC rearrangements.","pubmedId":"17464312"}
