Eight achieved a complete karyotypic remission before mobilization obtained with discontinuation of alpha-INF for few days and G-CSF at a dosage of 15 microg/kg/day for 5-7 consecutive days. By quantitative-competitive polymerase chain reaction (QC-PCR) assay, all the leukaphereses and bone marrow samples during post mobilization follow up were studied to determine the amount of bcr-abl transcript. Karyotypic and molecular analysis on evaluable leukapheresis showed that all the harvests were Ph negative and bcr-abl positive: in seven cases the levels of bcr-abl transcript were higher or equal to the pre-apheresis status. In three out of four patients, who underwent more than one leukapheresis procedure, we noticed a decreasing amount of bcr-abl contamination from the first to the last apheresis. Our results suggest that in patients who achieved a complete or major cytogenetic conversion with alpha-INF, it is possible to obtain a sufficient amount of PBSC for autografting by leukapheresis following priming G-CSF therapy and that the amount of neoplastic transcript does not seem to increase.","title":"Quantitative evaluation of BCR-ABL amount of transcript post mobilization with G-CSF of peripheral blood stem cells from chronic myeloid leukemia patients in cytogenetic response.","pubmedId":"10975389"}
