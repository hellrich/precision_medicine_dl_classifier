The patient had initially presented with mild gastrointestinal symptoms with rapid progression to fulminant hepatic failure and multiple organ dysfunction before the causative agent was identified. The patient survived with aggressive intensive care support and ongoing medical treatment. Physicians should be aware of the risk assessment based on the ingested dose, that the clinical presentation of colchicine in toxic doses may be nonspecific with high potential for severe morbidity or death and that survival may occur despite multiple organ failure requinng aggressive support.","title":"Unsuspected colchicine overdose in a female patient presenting as an acute abdomen.","pubmedId":"17591144"}
