Several hypotheses have been previously proposed to explain this occurrence, but the exact mechanism by which these metastases develop into meningiomas is not yet understood. Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy have been valuable diagnostic tools, but preoperative diagnosis of metastasis to meningioma remains highly difficult. We present a case report of a metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer into an intracranial meningioma.","title":"Non small cell carcinoma metastasis to meningioma.","pubmedId":"23441002"}
