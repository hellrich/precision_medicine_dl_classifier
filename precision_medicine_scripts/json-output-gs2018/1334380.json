Retrospective staging was possible in all but nine patients who had minor salivary gland primary tumors. Sixty-three percent of patients were diagnosed as having stage I or stage II disease (stage I, 64 patients; stage II, 47 patients), whereas 43 and 21 patients had stage III and IV tumors, respectively. Grading was as follows: cribriform pattern only (grade 1, 126 patients; 68%), mixed cribriform and solid features (grade 2, 48 patients; 26%), and solid only (grade 3, 10 patients; 5%). Treatment was predominantly surgical (174 patients), and relatively few patients received adjunctive, postoperative irradiation (27 patients). Cumulative 10-year survival was 75%, 43%, and 15% for stage I, stage II, and stage III and IV patients, respectively, and cause-specific survival at 10 years was as high as 94% in patients with stage I disease. Only the clinical stage had a significant impact on survival. Neither survival, regional metastases (16 patients; 11%), nor distant dissemination (64 patients; 43%) was predictable on the basis of tumor grade alone. The prognosis in patients with early stage lesions may be better than has been appreciated.","title":"Stage means more than grade in adenoid cystic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"1334380"}
