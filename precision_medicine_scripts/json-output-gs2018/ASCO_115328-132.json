Methods:  This ongoing phase 1b/2 study is evaluating the combination of LGX818, a potent, selective BRAF inhibitor, and MEK162, a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, in BRAFi-naive and -pretreated patients with BRAF-mutant tumors. The objective of the phase 1b part is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for oral, daily LGX818 + MEK162 in BRAF V600mutant advanced solid tumors. A Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control guides the treatment dose escalation.  Results:  As of January 8, 2013, 20 patients (7 BRAFi-naive melanoma; 9 BRAFi-pretreated melanoma; 2 BRAFi-naive thyroid cancer; 1 BRAFi-naive metastatic colorectal cancer; 1 BRAFi-pretreated colorectal cancer) were treated with LGX818 qd + MEK162 bid at the following dose levels (DLs): 50 mg + 45 mg, 100 mg + 45 mg, 200 mg + 45 mg, and 400 mg + 45 mg. No dose-limiting toxicity has been observed at these DLs. The next DL of 600 mg + 45 mg is under investigation. The single agent RP2Ds for LGX818 and MEK162 are 450 mg and 45 mg, respectively. The most common adverse events ( 20%, all grades) suspected to be treatment related were nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. No events of fever, hand-foot-skin reactions, hyperkeratosis, or squamous cell carcinoma were observed. In patients with at least 1 post-baseline CT scan available for investigator-determined response, a complete response was observed in 1/7 (14%) BRAFi-nave melanoma patients and partial responses were observed in 5/7 (71%) BRAFi-naive melanoma patients, 2/9 (22%) BRAFi-pretreated melanoma patients (starting at 50 mg + 45 mg DL), and 1/2 thyroid cancer patients.  Conclusions:  Preliminary data from this study indicate that LGX818 + MEK162 can be safely combined with promising clinical benefit. No febrile events or photosensitivity were reported suggesting a distinct safety profile for this BRAFi/MEKi combination vs others.
