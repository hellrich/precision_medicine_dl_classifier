Sixteen of 17 B-cell pediatric LCLs were negative, as were 6/6 cases of Hodgkin\u0027s disease and 7/7 cases of adult B-cell lymphoma. In pediatric LCLs with adequate follow-up (24/44 ALK+), there was no significant association between ALK expression and two-year event-free survival, similar to the finding reported previously for CD30 expression in these cases.\nWe conclude that the majority of pediatric CD30+ ALCLs show ALK overexpression, consistent with the presence of the t(2;5)-encoded NPM-ALK fusion, but that the clinical significance of this entity remains unproven.","title":"Use of an anti-ALK antibody in the characterization of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma of childhood.","pubmedId":"9187427"}
