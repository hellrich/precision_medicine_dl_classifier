However, primary GBM of the spinal cord is a rare condition.\nCase report.\nA young man presented with acute onset quadriparesis after a whiplash injury. A magnetic resonance scan showed the typical appearance of a high-grade intramedullary tumor with fusiform expansion of the entire cervical cord. Subtotal decompression and biopsy was done by posterior laminectomy, followed by external beam radiotherapy. Signs and symptoms improved after the completion of radiotherapy but did not resolve completely. Death caused by respiratory failure occurred 3 months later.\nThis presentation of GBM of the cervical cord is rare; an intramedullary tumor should be considered when minor cervical trauma results in disproportionate neurologic deficit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spinal GBM with extensive pan-cervical involvement.","title":"Spinal glioblastoma multiforme: unusual cause of post-traumatic tetraparesis.","pubmedId":"20025156"}
