A good sexual history and focused physical examination can provide clues as to whether the underlying cause is psychogenic or organic. Diagnostic investigation should be tailored to the clinical picture. Oral medications now represent first-line therapy. Penile injection therapy and vacuum constrictive devices are reasonable choices for men in whom oral therapy falls or is contraindicated. The penile prosthesis provides a reliable long-term solution with high satisfaction rates. Psychotherapy may be indicated. Physicians can have a positive impact on the quality of life of patients by providing a non-judgmental and supportive environment for discussion and management of impotence.","title":"Male impotence.","pubmedId":"10568586"}
