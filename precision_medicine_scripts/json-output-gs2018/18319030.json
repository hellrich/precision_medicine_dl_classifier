Part of the reason for a delay in presentation to the physician is that patients often attribute the lesion to trauma. Trauma may play a role in the pathogenesis or just draw attention to a skin tumor that may be more susceptible to injury. We report a case of subungual melanoma that was observed in an 86 year old man. The preceding trauma history and misleading clinical appearance delayed the diagnosis slightly. Biopsy of every nodular acral tumor is very important. A direct role of the trauma in the pathogenesis of melanoma remains unclear.","title":"Post traumatic amelanotic subungual melanoma.","pubmedId":"18319030"}
