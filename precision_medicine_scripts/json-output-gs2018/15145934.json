(2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 42409-42418). We have shown that stem cell factor (SCF) is involved in the proliferation of normal uveal melanocytes and that c-Kit is expressed in 75% of primary uveal melanomas. This suggests that the acquisition of autonomous growth during melanoma progression may involve the SCF/c-Kit axis. We used six human uveal melanoma tumor-derived cell lines and normal uveal melanocytes to characterize the SCF/c-Kit system and to assess its specific role in transformation. We investigated the possible roles of activating mutations in c-KIT, the overexpression of this gene, and ligand-dependent c-Kit overactivation in uveal melanoma cell tumorigenesis. Four cell lines (92.1, SP6.5, Mel270, and TP31) expressed both SCF and c-Kit, and none harbored the c-KIT mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 that have been shown to induce SCF-independent c-Kit activation. Melanoma cell proliferation was strongly inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of c-Kit in these cells, despite the presence of (V599E)B-Raf in SP6.5 and TP31 cells. We characterized the signaling pathways involved in SCF/c-Kit-mediated cell growth and survival in normal and tumoral melanocytes and found that constitutive ERK1/2 activation played a key role in both the SCF/c-Kit autocrine loop and the gain of function of (V599E)B-Raf for melanoma cell proliferation and transformation. We also provide the first evidence that Glivec/STI571, a c-Kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could be used to treat uveal melanomas.","title":"Roles of stem cell factor/c-Kit and effects of Glivec/STI571 in human uveal melanoma cell tumorigenesis.","pubmedId":"15145934"}
