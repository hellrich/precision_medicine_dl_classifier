We reported previously that levels of peptide-O-linked mannose β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (PomGnT1) in glioma specimens correlated with tumor grade. However, the prognostic significance of PomGnT1 in glioma patients and its function in GBM progression remain unknown.\nClinical relevance of PomGnT1 in GBM patients\u0027 prognosis was analyzed both in a clinically annotated expression dataset of 446 GBM tumor specimens and in 82 GBM tumor samples collected at our institution. The function of PomGnT1 in glioma growth and invasion, and the underlying mechanisms of PomGnT1 regulation were explored in vitro and in vivo.\nPomGnT1 expression in GBM tissues was closely associated with poor prognosis in GBM patients. Forced overexpression of PomGnT1 in glioblastoma cells impaired cell adhesion and increased their proliferation and invasion in vitro. Subsequent in vivo experiments showed that overexpression of PomGnT1 promoted tumor growth and shortened the survival time of tumor-bearing mice in an orthotopic model. Conversely, stable short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of PomGnT1 expression produced opposite effects both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resulted in EGFR/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent upregulation of PomGnT1, downregulation of receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase β, and activation of β-catenin pathway signaling.\nThese findings suggest that PomGnT1 promotes GBM progression via activation of β-catenin and may serve as a prognostic factor for glioma patient survival as well as a novel molecular target for anticancer therapy in malignant glioma.","title":"Role of glycosyltransferase PomGnT1 in glioblastoma progression.","pubmedId":"25085363"}
