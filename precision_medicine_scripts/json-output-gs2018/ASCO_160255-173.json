Mutational profiles may differ in pts. The objective of this study was to compare and describe the genomic complexity of CRC in pts \u003c 50 to \u003e 65 in the FoundationOne database. Methods:  DNA was extracted from 2,267 FFPE clinical specimens with colorectal cancer (CRC) (\u003c 50 yo, n\u003d1280; \u003e 65 yo, n \u003d 987). CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 603X for 3,769 exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer.  All classes of genomic alterations (GA) were identified.  Clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGA) were defined as GA linked to drugs on the market or under evaluation in mechanism driven clinical trials. Results:  Among the 50 genes analyzed, the \u003e differences were noted in BRAF and FAM123B in pts \u003e 65. KRAS mutations occurred in 50.5% vs 51.3%; NRAS, 2.6% vs 4.8%, BRAF, 5.5% vs 11.9% in younger pts vs older pts, respectively.  Few differences in genomic complexity were observed, although a trend toward increase frequency of BRAF mutations were observed in pts \u003e 65. Conclusions:  While some differences in tumor genomic profiles and complexity were observed in CRC pts \u003c 50 vs \u003e 65, changes in BRAF and FAM123B were more frequent in the \u003e 65.  Ongoing studies will assess differences in molecular and genomic features between younger and older CRC pts.
