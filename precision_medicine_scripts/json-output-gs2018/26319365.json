However, these agents are associated with the development of other nonmelanoma skin lesions, in particular squamoproliferative lesions such as keratoacanthomas (KAs), squamous cell carcinomas, and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses. The molecular pathogenesis of these lesions is of interest, not only for therapeutic reasons, but also for the insight it might provide into the development of similar lesions in a sporadic setting. We used next-generation sequencing to compare the mutational profiles of lesions after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, with similar lesions arising sporadically. HRAS mutations were common among the BRAF inhibitor-induced lesions, being identified in 56%, compared with 14% of lesions in the sporadic group (P \u003d 0.002). Thus, despite similar histomorphological appearances, the underlying molecular mechanisms may be different. In addition, within the BRAF inhibitor-associated group, the lesions designated as KAs and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses had a similar mutational profile (mutations in PIK3CA, APC, and HRAS), which was distinct to that seen in squamous cell carcinomas (FGFR3, CDKN2A, and STK11). We have previously noted histological overlap between KAs and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses, and this finding supports the notion that they may represent morphological or temporal variants of a single lesion type.
