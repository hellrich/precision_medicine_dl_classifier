Cultured human T lymphocytes were loaded with the intracellular fluorochrome indo-1 and were mixed with stimulator cells. Using flow cytometry we could detect a specific increase in intracellular calcium in the T lymphocytes as well as conjugation between the T cells and the stimulator cells. Examination of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones demonstrated that the vast majority of T cells which were conjugated to antigen-bearing stimulator cells manifested a rapid increase in intracellular calcium. In contrast T cells conjugated to stimulator cells which did not bear specific antigen demonstrated no such increase in calcium. A similar finding was observed when examining polyclonal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from patients with melanoma. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes with specific antitumor reactivity demonstrated an increase in intracellular calcium when conjugated to autologous tumor but not to allogeneic melanoma. In contrast to the T cell clones, only a small subpopulation of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes manifested this specific signal upon conjugation with autologous tumor. This suggests that tumor infiltrating lymphocyte cultures contain T cells with varying reactivities to tumor or may also imply heterogeneity in the stimulating tumor cell lines. The method allows for the detection of specific T cells on an individual cell basis in real time. The procedure is not lethal to the cell and sorting and subculturing of reactive T cell populations can be readily performed. The method could also be used to sort stimulator cells based on their ability to elicit an increase in intracellular calcium in selected T cells.","title":"Detection of antigen specific T lymphocytes by determination of intracellular calcium concentration using flow cytometry.","pubmedId":"1564323"}
