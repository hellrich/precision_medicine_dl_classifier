Thirty infertile male patients were orally given Goshajinkigan at a daily dose of 5.0 g for three months or more. Sixteen of these patients showed significant improvement in sperm motility. Ten cases showed effective increase in sperm count. Only one patients became pregnant during the period of administration of this drug. Laboratory examination showed no significant change in serum LH, serum FSH or prostaglandin E in seminal fluid. These results suggest that administration of TSUMURA-Goshajinkigan is effective as therapy for male infertility, but how this drug may be involved in promoting fertility should be investigated in future.","title":"[Clinical effects of goshajinkigan for male infertility].","pubmedId":"6528851"}
