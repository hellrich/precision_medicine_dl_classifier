Multiplex analysis of candidate serum analytes utilizing banked specimens from patients participating in this trial was evaluated to develop biomarkers of prognostic or therapeutic predictive value.Methods:The Aushon Multiplex Platform was used to simultaneously quantitate the serum levels of 115 candidate analytes selected based on previous data. Univariate proportional hazard (PH) model was used to assess the association between each marker and OS or RFS. The Benjamini and Hochberg\u0027s method was used to adjust for multiple testing. Baseline serum samples from 40 patients treated with the GMK vaccine were analyzed. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator proportional hazard regression (LASSOPH) was used to select markers that are most informative for RFS and OS. We then fit the regular PH models using the markers selected by the LASSOPH. The survival ROC analysis was used to evaluate the ability of the models to predict 1 year RFS and 5 year OS. Leave-one-out cross validations (LOOCVs) were used to avoid over fitting.Results:A panel of four markers, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha Receptor II (TNFRII), Transforming Growth Factor alpha (TGFa), Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1), and C-reactive protein (CRP), at baseline was found to be most informative to OS after GMK vaccine treatment (high serum levels correlate with worse prognosis). The dichotomized risk score based on the four markers can separate the OS curves well (log rank test p-value\u003d0.0005). When using the 4 marker PH model to predict the 5 year OS, we achieved an AUC of 89% (cross validated AUC\u003d72%). High baseline TNFRII was also identified as the most informative marker of worse RFS after GMK vaccine. The RFS of patients with high (above median) baseline TNFRII was significantly lower than that of patients with low (below median) baseline TNFRII (log rank test p-value\u003d0.01).Conclusions:Our modeling analysis yielded a panel of four serum biomarkers that is significantly prognostic of survival in patients with high-risk melanoma and warrants further investigation.","title":"Survival prognostic significance of TNFRII, TGFa, TIMP1 \u0026 CRP in high-risk melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-21"}
