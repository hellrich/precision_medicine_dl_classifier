We aimed to determine the incidence of and the risk factors for metachronous colorectal neoplasms after curative resection for CRC.\nWe retrospectively reviewed clinical data of patients who underwent curative resection for CRC at the National Cancer Center, Korea, from July 2004 to July 2007 and were followed up for a mean duration of 40.7 months. The incidence of and the risk factors for developing metachronous neoplasms were analyzed.\nA total of 1049 patients were included in this study. A follow-up colonoscopy showed that 454 (43.3%) patients developed metachronous neoplasms, including 46 (4.4%) with advanced adenoma or cancer. Univariate analyses revealed that age ≥ 60 years, male gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, synchronous adenoma, synchronous multiple adenoma and synchronous advanced adenoma were associated with the development of metachronous neoplasms. Baseline risk factors associated with metachronous advanced neoplasm were age ≥ 60 years, synchronous multiple adenoma and synchronous advanced adenoma. Multivariate analysis showed that age ≥ 60 years, synchronous adenoma and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for the development of metachronous neoplasms. The cumulative incidence of metachronous neoplasms was higher in patients with these risk factors than in those without.\nElder age, synchronous adenoma and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for developing metachronous neoplasia. Therefore, careful surveillance colonoscopy are necessary for these patients.","title":"Incidence and risk factors of metachronous colorectal neoplasm after curative resection of colorectal cancer in Korean patients.","pubmedId":"24773758"}
