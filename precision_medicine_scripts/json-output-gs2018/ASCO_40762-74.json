Methods: Of the 968 consecutive patients with primary lung cancer who underwent PET from October 2005 through September 2009, 26 patients had local abnormal accumulation in the gastrointestinal tract. We retrospectively compared the localization of abnormal accumulation in the gastrointestinal tract, standardized uptake value (SUV) max (1 hour), and the final clinical diagnosis. Results: The localization of abnormal accumulation were esophagus in 1, stomach in 8 and small intestine to large intestine in 17, respectively. 14 out of 26 (54%) cases with true PET positive were esophageal cancer in 1, gastric cancer in 2, colon cancer in 8, metastasis to stomach, small intestine and large intestine from lung cancer in one of each. 12 cases with false PET positive were stomach polyp in 1, gastritis in 3, gastrointestinal stromal tumor in 1, colon polyp in 1, diverticulitis in1 and normal physiologic accumulation in 5, respectively. There were no differences in mean SUVmax between malignant lesions, benign lesions, and normal physiologic accumulation. Conclusions: We should perform the endoscopy of digestive tract for the detection of high incidental malignant lesion when the PET showed local abnormal accumulation in the gastrointestinal tract in patients with lung cancer.","title":"The role of PET scan for the detection of incidental gastrointestinal tract lesions in patients examined for lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_40762-74"}
