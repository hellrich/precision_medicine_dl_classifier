In cases of BRAF mutations, GLUT1 seems to be a target of the constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. In this study, we hypothesized that the common BRAF V600E mutation was associated with GLUT1 overexpression and proliferation in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs).\nA total of 57 cases of paraffin-embedded PTC (31 BRAF V600E, 26 wild-type BRAF) were investigated using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against GLUT1 and Ki-67 (MK167) protein. The BRAF V600E mutations were detected using direct sequencing of genomic DNA that was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. GLUT1 expression was assessed using the Remmele immunoreactive score and subdivided into three groups (I\u003dnegative, II\u003dweakly positive, and III\u003dpositive). The Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) was determined by counting Ki-67-positive nuclei.\nGLUT1 expression was found in 39/57 (68.4%) samples of PTC. The occurrence of the BRAF V600E genetic variant was significantly correlated with GLUT1 overexpression (p\u003d0.007) and showed a trend toward higher proliferation, which was indicated by Ki-67 LI (p\u003d0.06). Moreover, GLUT1 overexpression was positively associated with Ki-67 labeling (p\u003d0.023).\nThe V600E BRAF mutation in PTC may contribute to the initiation of the glycolytic phenotype and confers growth advantages in cancer cells. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancer cell energy metabolism may lead to the implementation of targeted treatment modalities, which regulate cancer glucose uptake.","title":"The BRAF V600E mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma is associated with glucose transporter 1 overexpression.","pubmedId":"22376167"}
