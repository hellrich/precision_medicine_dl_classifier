This study aimed to search for the coexisting gene alterations in Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LAC).\nWe detected mutations in the EGFR, KRAS, and ALK gene rearrangements in samples from 131 Chinese patients with LAC. ALK rearrangements were identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Mutations in EGFR (exons 19 to 21) and KRAS (codons 12 and 13) were determined by real time polymerase chain reaction.\nAll patients were classified into four distinct genotype groups: EGFR mutations (n \u003d 63; 48.1%), ALK rearrangements (n \u003d 9; 6.9%), KRAS mutations (n \u003d 8; 6.1%), and the wild-type (unmutated) genotype of all three genes (WT/WT/WT) (n \u003d 53; 40.5%). Interestingly, two never-smoking women (2/131, 1.5%) harbored coexisting ALK rearrangement and EGFR mutation. ALK rearrangement occurred more frequently in young patients (8/9) (P \u003d 0.687), non-smokers (8/9) (P \u003d 0.077), and those who had no family history of LAC (8/9) (P \u003d 1.000); all KRAS mutations occurred in the EGFR wild type (P \u003d 0.007). KRAS mutations were generally detected in young patients (6/8) (P \u003d 0.658) and in those who had no family history (7/8) (P \u003d 1.000); EGFR mutations correlated with gender (P \u003d 0.001), and smoking status (P \u003c 0.001).\nTwo patients harboring both EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK rearrangement were detected in this study. Our data was apparently inconsistent with the traditional view that the EML4-ALK fusion gene in patients is resistant to EGFR-TKIs.","title":"Echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement and epidermal growth factor receptor mutation coexisting in Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26767032"}
