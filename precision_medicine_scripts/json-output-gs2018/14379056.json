Since there is a relatively high incidence of malignant diseases on the soles of the feet and the genitalia, routine removal of nevi developing in those areas is recommended.\"Juvenile melanomas\" are active, cellular nevi occurring in prepubertal children. The clinical course is probably benign. The tenet of excision and dissection in continuity where feasible of the primary melanoma and the regional lymph nodes is reemphasized. When continuous dissection is not possible, regional node dissection is recommended as a separate procedure. Major amputations for melanomas of the extremities are not recommended for the usual case.","title":"The surgical treatment of melanoma.","pubmedId":"14379056"}
