In 364 healthy blood donors, cut-off values were set at 5.4 ng/ml for females and 6.5 ng/ml for males. The positive rate of primary breast cancer was 13.0% (24/185) and that of recurrent breast cancer was 51.2% (62/121). No significant correlation was found between serum levels of ErbB-2 protein and other tumor markers, such as CEA, CA 15-3, and ST 439. Measurement of ErbB-2 protein in combination with these tumor markers showed increased sensitivities. The positive rates and levels of ErbB-2 protein in sera of patients with metastasis to multiple organs were significantly higher than those in patients with metastasis to only a single organ. In postoperative follow-up of two patients with recurrent breast cancer, the levels of ErbB-2 exceeded its cut-off value a few months earlier than did the other tumor markers. These results indicate that the measurement of the ErbB-2 protein in serum is useful for the diagnosis and a monitoring the relapse of breast carcinoma.","title":"[Clinical evaluation of serum ErbB-2 protein using enzyme immuno assay (ErbB-2 EIA [Nichirei])].","pubmedId":"7913313"}
