Recent studies have reported frequent p16 gene deletions in cell lines from squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN), although the prevalence of alterations was variable in primary tumors. This study determined the prevalence of point mutations and deletions of the p16 gene in 33 SCCHN. In addition, the association of p16 gene alterations and abnormalities of p53, PRAD-1 (cyclin D1), and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) was examined. We found an overall prevalence of p16 alterations of 36% (nine deletions, three single base substitutions, including one polymorphism). Seven tumors (of 29, 24%) had an alteration of p16 and p53; five (of 33, 15%) had alterations of p16 and PRAD-1; three (of 29, 10%) had alterations of all three genes. In addition, of the five tumors with human papillomavirus detected, only one also had a p16 gene alteration. The results indicate a potentially important role for the p16 gene in head and neck tumorigenesis. In addition, the presence of tumors with multiple somatic gene alterations suggest a possible interaction in the dysregulation of the cell cycle.","title":"Alterations of the p16 gene in head and neck cancer: frequency and association with p53, PRAD-1 and HPV.","pubmedId":"9047388"}
