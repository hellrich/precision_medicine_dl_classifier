The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the EGFR family in gastric cancer.\nThis retrospective study included 201 patients with gastric and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma stages 0-IV (AJCC 6th edition) who underwent primary tumor resection. Tissues from primary tumors were analyzed by tissue microarray technology and immunohistochemistry. Correlations between receptor expression and clinicopathological characteristics were performed according to the chi-square test. Survival analysis was calculated according to the Weibull model with a mixture model incorporating long-term survivors. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors was performed by a regression model incorporating long-term survivors with the Weibull distribution.\nMembrane expression of HER1, HER2, and HER4 were 9, 17, and 15 %, respectively. No membrane expression of HER3 was observed. Cytoplasmic expression of HER1, HER3, and HER4 were 45, 62, and 24 %, respectively. HER2 and HER3 expression were correlated (p \u003c 0.001) and associated with intestinal-type histology (p \u003d 0.001 and p \u003c 0.001, respectively) and advanced age (p \u003d 0.011 and p \u003d 0.008, respectively). According to a regression model adjusted for age, surgical radicality, surgical modality, Laur√©n histology, adjuvant therapy, TNM stage, and receptor expressions, only TNM stage showed prognostic influence.\nAccording to analysis by a parametric model, the EGFR family did not have prognostic influence in the gastric cancer population studied. The data presented showed a correlation between HER2 and HER3 expression, which might suggest a potential role for HER2-HER3 heterodimerization inhibitors.","title":"Prognostic value of epidermal growth factor receptors in gastric cancer: a survival analysis by Weibull model incorporating long-term survivors.","pubmedId":"23455716"}
