In addition, the progression of human melanoma towards the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of expression of the tyrosine-kinase receptor c-KIT. This review summarizes our recent data demonstrating that the expression of both genes is regulated by the AP-2 transcription factor. Moreover, we have observed a loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells. Re-expression of AP-2 in the highly metastatic A375SM cells decreased their tumorigenicity and inhibited their metastatic potential in nude mice. MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression was significantly downregulated while c-KIT expression was upregulated in the AP-2 transfected cells. Since AP-2 also regulates other genes that are involved in the progression of human melanoma such as E-cadherin, MMP-2, p21WAF-1, HER-2, BCL-2, and insulin like growth factor receptor-1, we propose that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma.","title":"Role of AP-2 in tumor growth and metastasis of human melanoma.","pubmedId":"10721491"}
