Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is a common disease with little progress made in survival over the past few decades. SCCHN is characterized by overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), both of which appear to have a prognostic value. Hence these receptors and their downstream pathways make attractive therapeutic targets. This review discusses targeted therapies currently being evaluated for their role in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","title":"Targeted therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"21057567"}
