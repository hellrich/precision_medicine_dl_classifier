Dysplastic nevi are known to occur in multiples in family members of heritable malignant melanoma. Intraepidermal atypical melanocytes fulfilling the criteria of the dysplastic nevus were seen in histologic contiguity with superficial malignant nonfamilial melanomas in six of 13 patients. With one exception, all melanomas in this study that were associated with histologically contiguous dysplastic nevi were relatively thin, allowing identification of the melanoma at a potentially curable stage.","title":"Dysplastic nevus in histologic contiguity with acquired nonfamilial melanoma.
