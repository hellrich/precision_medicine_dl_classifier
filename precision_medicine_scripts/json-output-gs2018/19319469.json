Most result from de-differentiation from low grade astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma) or can develop de novo (primary glioblastoma). Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients while secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and contain TP53 mutations as the earliest detectable change. We report a 28 year old patient with primary multi-focal cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme and review the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of cerebellar glioblastomas.","title":"Cerebellar glioblastomas: pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management.","pubmedId":"19319469"}
