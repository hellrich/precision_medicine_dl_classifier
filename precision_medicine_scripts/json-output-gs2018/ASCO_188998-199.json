In addition to echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion, TRK-fused gene (TFG)-ALK, kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B)-ALK and kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1)-ALK had been reported in lung cancer. On the other hand, RET proto-oncogene (RET) and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) fusion proteins also have prevalence in lung cancer. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved several target drugs are available to treat patients with fusion mutations. Therefore, the diagnosis of ALK, RET or ROS1 fusion genes shows quite important. However, nowadays methods of detecting fusions such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) are limited to technique, low sensitivity, sample quality as well as subtype classification. Methods: We established nucleotide MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry based multiplex detection platform to distinguish major types including 9 types of EML4-ALK, 5 types of ALK, 5 types of RET and 8 types ROS1 fusions. Results: The detection limitation was about less 1% mutant cells among wild-type cells. In the pilot testing, we used 2 patients cell cDNA and 4 patients lung FFPE samples cDNA, which had been diagnosed as ALK fusion before, to be detected by this panel, and then identified their variant types successfully. Furthermore, one patient harbored CCDC6-RET fusion mutation was identified by our platform and confirmed by Sanger Sequencing. Conclusions: Taken together, this new panel has high sensitivity and allows little and poor quality samples for detecting. The correlation between clinical characteristics and fusion subtypes can be further investigated by utilizing this platform in the future. Also, the detection panel can be revised based on clinical needs by removing/adding probes.","title":"Multiplex ALK, RET, and ROS1 fusion mutation detection in FFPE from lung cancer patients by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.","pubmedId":"ASCO_188998-199"}
