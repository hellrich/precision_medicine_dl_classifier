This review provides an update on molecular genetics of periocular cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma and describes how the knowledge of molecular genetics is translated into clinical practice.\nA literature search of peer-reviewed and indexed publications from 1965 to 2012 using the PubMed search engine was performed. Key terms included: molecular genetics, eyelid, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous adenoma, sebaceous epithelioma, sebaceoma, sebaceous carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Seminal articles prior to 1965 were selected from primary sources and reviews from the initial search. Articles were chosen based on pertinence to clinical, genetic, and therapeutic topics reviewed in this manuscript.\nWe reviewed the literature regarding the advances in molecular genetics of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous neoplasia, Merkel cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma, and possible future directions towards diagnosing and treating cutaneous tumors at the genetic level. Cell culture experiments, animal models, and molecular genetic studies on the patients\u0027 tumor tissues helped to elucidate genetic aberrations in these lesions. Cell culture experiments, animal studies and, ultimately, clinical trials provided means to test and develop novel therapeutic strategies, namely targeted therapy directed at specific molecular genetic defects. While remarkable progress has been made in this process, the complexity of the molecular genetics of skin tumors makes complete elucidation of the genetic mechanisms and the search for ideal therapies challenging.\nThe recent studies focusing on molecular genetics of cutaneous malignancies show promising results, thereby improving our ability to diagnose, treat and counsel patients with these lesions. Future studies will hopefully help unravel further molecular mechanisms involved in cutaneous neoplasia and provide insights into novel preventative and therapeutic modalities.","title":"The molecular genetics of eyelid tumors: recent advances and future directions.","pubmedId":"23275038"}
