We report a case of a 39-year-old man that presented multiple cutaneous metastases from a parotid salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma. The clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical features are described and discussed. This case shows the importance of a detailed and periodical skin examination in patients treated for salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma.","title":"Multiple cutaneous metastases from a parotid adenoid cystic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17607381"}
