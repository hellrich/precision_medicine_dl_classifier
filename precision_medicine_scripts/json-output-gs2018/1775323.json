The lower eyelid was more frequently the site of origin than the upper eyelid (21 patients, 66% of cases). A clinical diagnosis of melanoma was made in only 2 of 13 patients (15%) for whom the clinical diagnosis was listed. Clinical findings of pigmentation, ulceration/hemorrhage, or growth were documented in 25 (78%) patients. The histopathologic classification of the melanomas included nodular (19 patients, 59%), superficial spreading (7 patients, 22%), and lentigo maligna (6 patients, 19%). Associated histopathologic findings included solar elastosis (13 patients, 41%), nevus (12 patients, 38%), and basal cell carcinoma (4 patients, 13%). One of eighteen patients with follow-up data available died of metastatic melanoma.","title":"Cutaneous melanoma of the eyelid. Clinicopathologic features.","pubmedId":"1775323"}
