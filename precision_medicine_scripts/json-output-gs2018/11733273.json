In contrast, the two patients who were in complete remission, but had undergone bone marrow transplantation, had retinal infiltrates attributable to infection.\nEvery patient with retinal infiltrates in the setting of newly or previously diagnosed leukemia requires a systemic and central nervous system workup before the initiation of ophthalmologic treatment. The systemic status of the patient is highly informative in determining whether infection or neoplasia is responsible for the infiltration.","title":"Ocular manifestations of leukemia: leukemic infiltration versus infectious process.","pubmedId":"11733273"}
