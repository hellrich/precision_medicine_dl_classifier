While a high proportion of adults with PTCL have poor risk disease, pediatric PTCL is not well characterized. This study examines the outcome of localized and advanced PTCL in pediatric patients treated in standardized fashion.\nWe identified 20 pediatric patients diagnosed with PTCL whose tumor cells did not express CD30 and/or ALK, as determined by immunohistochemistry, between 1992 and 2000 on one of two treatment protocols for localized NHL (POG 9219) or advanced stage large cell lymphoma (POG 9315). All cases were centrally reviewed.\nThe median age was 12.6 (range 0.7-16.9)-9 male and 11 female. Histological subtypes in the WHO Classification included PTCL, unspecified (12), extra-nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of nasal type (4), subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma (1) and enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma (1). Two cases exhibited both T-cell and histiocyte markers and were reclassified as histiocytic sarcoma per the WHO, although T-lineage remains possible. Of 10 patients with localized disease, only two relapsed and 9 survive. Of 10 patients with advanced disease, six relapsed and five (50%) survive.\nThese results suggest that localized PTCL in children and adolescents is frequently cured with modern therapy, but that advanced stage cases may require novel therapy.","title":"Non-anaplastic peripheral t-cell lymphoma in childhood and adolescence: a Children\u0027s Oncology Group study.","pubmedId":"18300314"}
