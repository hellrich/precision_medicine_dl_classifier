Despite achieving an initial response, skin lesions worsened after 11 courses. A skin biopsy after the development of resistance to BV confirmed loss of CD30 expression by the tumor cells, suggesting a possible cause of resistance. This case shows that down-regulation of CD30 does occur during BV treatment, resulting in resistance to this drug. Because of this possibility, in the future, expression of CD30 should be carefully monitored with extended use of BV against ALCL.
