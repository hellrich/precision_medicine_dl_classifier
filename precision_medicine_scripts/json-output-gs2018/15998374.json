Reduced Fhit and Wwox expression has been reported in approximately two-thirds of invasive breast tumors. Expression of these fragile gene products, as well as ErbB2 and p53, were evaluated immunohistochemically in 44 pure and 31 adjacent-to-invasive ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) cases. Reduced Fhit and Wwox expression were observed in (i) 70% and 68% of pure DCIS; (ii) 52% and 55% of DCIS adjacent-to-invasive tumor cases; and (iii) 20% and 50% of adjacent normal tissue in pure DCIS cases. Reduced Wwox expression in adjacent normal tissue was observed in 30% of cases in the DCIS adjacent-to-invasive group. Reduced Fhit and Wwox expression was observed in 61% of adjoining invasive tumors. In all normal, pure DCIS, and DCIS adjacent-to-invasive lesions, Fhit and Wwox expression was positively associated (P \u003d 0.034, P \u003d 0.042, P \u003d 0.004, respectively) and in the invasive component there was a positive trend toward association (P \u003d 0.075). Fhit and Wwox were more frequently reduced in high-grade lesions in the DCIS adjacent-to-invasive (P \u003d 0.025, P \u003d 0.004, respectively). In the pure DCIS group, there was a statistically significant negative association between Fhit and ErbB2 expression in DCIS (P \u003d 0.035). In summary, reduced Fhit and Wwox expression in in-situ breast cancer was associated, which may contribute to the high-grade DCIS-invasive tumor pathway.","title":"Concordant loss of fragile gene expression early in breast cancer development.","pubmedId":"15998374"}
