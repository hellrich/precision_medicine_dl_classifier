We previously identified EBAG9 as an estrogen-responsive gene in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells. Upregulation of EBAG9 expression has been observed in several malignant tumors such as advanced breast cancers, indicating that EBAG9 might contribute to tumor progression.\nIn the present study, we generated a monoclonal antibody against EBAG9, and then performed immunohistochemical analysis of EBAG9 expression in specimens obtained from breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen as an adjuvant therapy.\nEBAG9 immunoreactivity was detected in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells and was significantly elevated in breast cancer samples from patients who relapsed during or after adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Positive EBAG9 immunoreactivity was significantly correlated with poor patient prognosis.\nThese results suggest that EBAG9 expression in tumor regions is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.","title":"Association of positive EBAG9 immunoreactivity with unfavorable prognosis in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.","pubmedId":"24119785"}
