A Phase 1 trial in patients with relapsed and refractory HL or systemic ALCL supported a dose of 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The drug was well tolerated, with the majority of adverse reactions being grade 1 or 2 in severity. Common toxicities included fatigue, pyrexia, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy. Phase 2 studies in the same patient populations illustrated objective response rates of 73-86% with an acceptable toxicity profile. Based on results of these Phase 2 trials, the Food and Drug Administration granted approval of brentuximab vedotin in August 2011 for the treatment of relapsed and refractory HL or ALCL.\nPhase 1 and 2 clinical trial data indicate that brentuximab vedotin is efficacious and safe in patients with relapsed and refractory CD30-positive lymphomas. This agent is being investigated in combination with chemotherapy to further elucidate its role in lymphoma therapy.","title":"Brentuximab vedotin: a new age in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"22395252"}
