The same mutation was detected in two-thirds of our cutaneous melanoma samples, but was not present in any uveal melanomas. This finding further underlines the distinction between uveal and cutaneous melanomas, and suggests that BRAF inhibitors are unlikely to benefit patients with uveal melanoma.","title":"Absence of BRAF gene mutations in uveal melanomas in contrast to cutaneous melanomas.","pubmedId":"12778069"}
