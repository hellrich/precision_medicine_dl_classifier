Despite many efforts, no candidate tumour suppressor gene associated with malignant melanoma has so far been found in this region. To further determine a possible tumour suppressor gene locus, we carried out a deletion mapping of chromosome 1p36 at nine microsatellite loci in 74 malignant melanomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in this region was found in 77% of nodular melanomas (NMs), 86% of metastatic melanomas, but only 20% of superficial spreading melanomas (SSMs). Regarding the allelic losses, the nodular and metastatic melanoma samples could be divided into three groups: one showing LOH at the more telomeric loci D1S243 and D1S468 (1p36.33), one displaying allelic loss at the more centromeric loci D1S214 and D1S253 (1p36.32-31) and one with LOH over all informative loci between D1S243 and D1S160. We did not find any significant correlation between a deletion in any of the investigated loci and the survival data of the patients. However, our results confine the deleted region in malignant melanoma to a very small area around 1p36.32, thus facilitating the search for the tumour suppressor gene with importance in malignant melanoma.","title":"Microsatellite analysis at 1p36.3 in malignant melanoma of the skin: fine mapping in search of a possible tumour suppressor gene region.","pubmedId":"12569282"}
