Additionally, 18 bladder samples were studied for ERBB2 gene amplification by real-time quantitative PCR.\nTwenty-five tumors (34.2%) overexpressed ERBB2 mRNA compared to normal bladder samples; this alteration appeared in low-grade and low-stage tumors (pTaG1). Twenty-four (32.9%) tumors showed moderate (++) or strong (+++) immunostaining. A very strong agreement was found between the two methods (kappa \u003d 0.97, 95% confidence interval, 0.90-1). ErbB2 status was not associated with tumor stage. Of the 18 bladder samples tested for ERBB2 gene amplification, only one showed ERBB2 DNA amplification.\nErbB2 overexpression occurs in about one third of bladder TCCs. This overexpression can be detected by RT-PCR with a very good correlation with IHC. RT-PCR can therefore be used for cases considered doubtful on IHC rather than gene amplification studies because, in TCC, gene amplification is not the predominant mechanism of both mRNA and protein overexpression. Accurate quantification of ErbB2 status is mandatory for the use of anti-ErbB2-targeted therapies in bladder TCC.","title":"Is quantitative real-time RT-PCR an adjunct to immunohistochemistry for the evaluation of ErbB2 status in transitional carcinoma of the bladder?","pubmedId":"16466848"}
