Though polymorphisms have been reported in GSTO1 and GSTO2, their predisposition to cancer risk has not yet been explored. In this case control study, 28 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 30 cases of cholangiocarcinoma, 31 cases of colorectal cancer, 30 cases of breast cancer and 98 controls were compared for frequencies of GSTO1 and GSTO2 genotypes. The statistical analysis provided the support for the difference in genotypic distribution for GSTO1*A140D between hepatocellular carcinoma (OR 23.83, CI 95%: 5.07-127), cholangiocarcinoma (OR 8.5, CI 95%: 2.07-37.85), breast cancer (OR 3.71, CI 95%: 1.09-13.02) and control. With regards to GSTO2*N140D polymorphism, there was no difference in genotypic distribution between all the types of cancer and control. The study suggests that GSTO1*A140D polymorphism could play an important role as a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and breast cancer.","title":"Polymorphism of glutathione S-transferase omega gene and risk of cancer.","pubmedId":"15992993"}
