The FOLFIRINOX regimen was shown to significantly improve the survival of PDAC patients over gemcitabine but occurred at the expense of significant toxicities, highlighting the crucial need for more effective treatment options that are tolerable. This study sought to investigate the effects of oxaliplatin, xeloda and irinotecan (OXIRI) regimen versus the G+E regimen in PDAC cell lines. Methods: The anti-proliferative effects of the drug combinations were analyzed in a panel of human PDAC cell lines, BxPC3 (KRASWT), PANC-1 (KRASG12D), MIAPaCa-2 (KRASG12C) and AsPC-1 (KRASG12D) (ATCC). Cells were treated at the following concentrations: oxaliplatin (0.0001 nM - 100 uM), SN-38 (0.00001 nM - 10 uM), 5-FU (0.0001 nM - 100 uM), gemcitabine (0.001 nM - 100 uM) and erlotinib (0.001 nM - 10 uM) and cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay 72 hours after drug treatments. Cell cycle and apoptosis analyses were performed using FITC BrdU Flow Kit and Annexin V-FITC Assay, respectively, and results analyzed using FACSDiva v6.1.2. Results: As single agents, all four PDAC cells lines were most sensitive to oxaliplatin and least sensitive to erlotinib. The OXIRI regimen was more effective than gemcitabine alone, as well as the G+E regimen in inhibiting cell proliferation across all the four cell lines. At clinically relevant concentrations of oxaliplatin 10 uM, 5-FU 10 uM and SN-38 1 uM, greater than 90% growth inhibition was achieved in BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells and greater than 80% inhibition was achieved in PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells. In contrast, treatment with gemcitabine 100 uM and erlotinib 1-10 uM only resulted in approximately 50% growth inhibition in MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells, and 67% growth inhibition in BxPC-3 cells. Notably, evidence of marked G2-M and S phase arrest and increased apoptosis were observed across all four cell lines treated with the OXIRI regimen. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the OXIRI regimen exhibits greater anti-cancer effects than the combination of gemcitabine and erlotinib in PDAC cell lines.","title":"Effects of oxaliplatin, capecitabine and irinotecan (OXIRI) on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines carrying different Kras mutational status.","pubmedId":"ASCO_169317-176"}
