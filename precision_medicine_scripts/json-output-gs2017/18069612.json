The anti-tyrosine receptor drugs are among the most developed, some of them having already been approved by the FDA and the EMEA for breast cancer, colorectal, lung GIST and renal cancer treatment. Although these drugs are currently focused on a single target, the future challenge is to hit several targets simultaneously, along with combined chemotherapy. Thus we are facing the beginning of a new era in the battle against cancer.","title":"[Targeted therapy for cancer: anti-tyrosine kinase receptor agents].","pubmedId":"18069612"}
