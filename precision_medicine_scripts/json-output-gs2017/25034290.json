Classification systems for CC typically group tumours by anatomical location into intrahepatic, hilar or extrahepatic subtypes. Surgical resection or liver transplantation remains the only curative therapy for CC, but up to 80% of patients present with advanced, irresectable disease. Unresectable CC remains resistant to many chemotherapeutic agents, although gemcitabine, particularly in combination with other agents, has been shown to improve overall survival. Ongoing investigation of biological agents has also yielded some promising results. Several novel interventional and endoscopic techniques for the diagnosis and management of non-operable CC have been developed: initial results show improvements in symptoms and progression-free survival, but further randomised studies are required to establish their role in the management of CC.","title":"Update on the management of cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25034290"}
