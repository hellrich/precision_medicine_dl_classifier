An additional case of liposarcoma is described which was treated by tumor excision without involvement of the testis. The diagnosis, classification and treatment of this condition are discussed.\nLiposarcoma is a very uncommon tumor and its diagnosis is based on the anatomopathological findings. Treatment is by orchidectomy with high ligation of the spermatic cord. However, the case described herein was treated only by resection of the tumor. Radiotherapy may be indicated in some cases. Chemotherapy does not appear to be useful in this type of tumor.\nIn some cases of scrotal liposarcoma, the tumor can be resected without performing orchidectomy.","title":"[Scrotal liposarcoma].","pubmedId":"11692442"}
