The chemotherapy regimen consisted of weekly paclitaxel plus cisplatin or weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin for 5 weeks. The concurrent thoracic radiotherapy dose was 45 Gy over 5 weeks. Surgical resection was planned at around 4 weeks following the completion of neoadjuvant therapy.\nOf 186 patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy, 23 bilobectomies, 28 pneumonectomies, and 135 lobectomies were performed. The early postoperative mortality rate (within 30 days after operation) was 7.1, 8.7, and 1.5% for the pneumonectomy, bilobectomy, and lobectomy groups, respectively. The late postoperative mortality rate (within 90 days) of the lobectomy, bilobectomy, and pneumonectomy groups was 5.9, 13, and 10.7%, respectively. Overall survival was significantly higher among patients treated by lobectomy than among those treated by bilobectomy (p \u003d 0.041) or pneumonectomy (p \u003d 0.010). Recurrence was significantly lower in patients treated by lobectomy than in those treated by pneumonectomy (p \u003d 0.034).\nBilobectomy is associated with high operative mortality and poor long-term survival after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage IIIA-N2 non-small-cell lung cancer. The outcomes of bilobectomy were similar to those of pneumonectomy in terms of overall survival, disease-free survival, and postoperative mortality.","title":"Risk associated with bilobectomy after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage IIIA-N2 non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22374538"}
