This intratumor and intertumor genetic diversity results in a heterogeneous tumor with unique characteristics which potentially allows effective drug therapy. The goal of pharmacogenomics is to elucidate the genetic network(s) that underlie drug efficacy and drug resistance. Advances in targeted and personalized therapy play an increasingly important role in many common cancers, notably lung cancer, due to the high incidence, prevalence, mortality and the greater tendency towards drug resistance seen in these patients. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and or downstream kinase pathways. This has led to the development of highly selective monoclonal antibodies and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) to prevent cancer initiation, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, survival, and invasion. However, resistance to many of these new treatments is induced and further pharmacogenomic analysis has revealed mutations associated with increased or reduced drug efficacy. Combinations of kinase inhibitors or potentially the targeting of cancer stem cells may further increase the success of pharmacogenomics in treating patients with lung cancer.","title":"Pharmacogenomics and targeted therapy of cancer: Focusing on non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25725115"}
