In the 24 samples with low or no HER-2 gene expression (1+/-) detected by IHC, no HER-2 gene amplification was detected by FISH. The results of the two testing methods showed a good consistency with the kappa coefficient of 0.672 (P\u003c0.001). We also found that the 17 chromosome polysomy in 42% of the samples and the incidence of 17 polysomy was significantly higher in the HER-2 gene overexpression (3+/2+) group than in low or no HER-2 gene expression (1+/-) group (chi(2)\u003d4.688, P\u003d0.03).\nIHC can be used as a screening method for detecting HER-2 gene amplification, and FISH should be performed in cases of HER-2 gene overexpression (3+/2+) as detected by IHC.","title":"[Evaluation on parallel HER-2 testing using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in breast cancer tissues].","pubmedId":"19923073"}
