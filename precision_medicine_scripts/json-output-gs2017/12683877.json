The tumor had classic features of a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor with interlacing fascicles and whorls of spindled cells, numerous and conspicuous mitotic figures, and extensive coagulative necrosis. The cells stained diffusely for CD117 (c-Kit), confirming the diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The spleen, 1 adrenal gland, and part of the pancreas were removed en block with the stomach. By microscopy, the spleen and adrenal gland were partially replaced with amyloid deposits confirmed by Congo red staining, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. In contrast, neither the tumor nor the surrounding vasculature showed amyloid deposition. To our knowledge, this represents only the second case of systemic amyloidosis associated with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. This case is unique in that extensive, diffuse amyloid deposits were observed in the spleen, adrenal gland, and liver.","title":"Secondary amyloidosis and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
