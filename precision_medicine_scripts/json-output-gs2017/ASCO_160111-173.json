Unfortunately, minimal data exists in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Next generation sequencing (NGS) may provide genetic signatures that allow prognostic stratification and predict response to targeted therapy.  Methods:    DNA was extracted from biopsy specimens of 64 patients (pts) with PDA at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. DNA sequencing was performed for 3,769 exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes to an average depth of 1000X using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA). We report all genetic alterations including those classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS) as these may potentially be important for further study.  Results:    94% of our patients had KRAS mutations, SMAD(39%) P53 (69%), and CDKN2A (48%). 17% of the pts had all 4 mutations. 4.6% had none.  MLL and ARID genes, both involved in chromatin remodeling, were altered in (45%) and (35%) of the patients respectively. Alterations in MLL2 (22%) have been previously described. Interestingly, we also identified mutations in MLL3 (15%) and MLL (8%) of patients. We also identified an equal frequency of mutations in ARID1A mutations (17%) and ARID 1B (17%).  ATM (19%) and ATR (11%) genes involved in double stranded DNA repair were mutated in a total of 30%. BRCA1 (12.5%) and BRCA2 (14%) were mutated in 26.5%, and PALB2 in another 2%. PMS2 (mismatch repair) was also mutated in 9% of patients. In total 67% of patients had alterations in one of these DNA repair pathways.  There were a number of other genes noted to harbor mutations in greater than 10% of patients including BCOR, which is known to interact with MLL and seen in acute leukemia, FANC complex, GPR124 (angiogenesis), as well IRS2, PIK3A in the akt-PIK pathway.  Conclusions:    NGS in a cohort of advanced pancreatic cancer patients identified novel alterations in genes associated with chromatin modeling and DNA repair. These pathways may serve as potential avenues for targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer.","title":"DNA sequencing to identify potentially novel targets for therapy in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_160111-173"}
