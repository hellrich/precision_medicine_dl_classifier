We report three operated cases of pulmonary embolism incorrectly diagnosed as lung cancer. The first patient is a 39-year-old male with chest pain an bloody sputum. Chest x-ray revealed abnormal shadows and subsequent sputum cytological tests identified malignant cells. The second patient is a 63-year-old male with the same diagnostic pattern as the first case. The third patient is a 72-year-old male whose routine chest x-ray showed an abnormal shadow; malignant cells were identified by cytological tests on transbronchial fiberscope brushings. These three patients were histopathologically diagnosed as suffering pulmonary embolism by wedge resection under thoracotomy. When a patient has chest pain or bloody sputum with showing temporarily malignant cells on cytology, the possibility of pulmonary embolism should be taken into consideration.","title":"[Three cases of pulmonary embolism incorrectly diagnosed as lung cancer].","pubmedId":"9884565"}
