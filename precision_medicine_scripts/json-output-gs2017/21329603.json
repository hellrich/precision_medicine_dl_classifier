The ratio of E₂/T of male patients with lung cancer was also remarkably higher than that of control . The ratio of E₂/T of male patients with lung cancer was also remarkably higher than that of control [(9.7±10.0) ×10⁻³[WTBX]vs ( 3.4±1.6)×10⁻³, P\u003d0.004 6]. The expression rate of ER in lung cancer tissue samples was 60.0% (15/25), but no ER expression was found in the paracancerous tissues and benign pulmonary tissues. The level of E₂ had positive correlation with the expression of ER in male patients with lung cancer (. The expression rate of ER in lung cancer tissue samples was 60.0% (15/25), but no ER expression was found in the paracancerous tissues and benign pulmonary tissues. The level of E₂ had positive correlation with the expression of ER in male patients with lung cancer (r\u003d0.916 7, P \u003c 0.001).\nThere are disorders and imbalances of sexual hormone metabolism in male patients with lung cancer, and these imbalances relate to the expression of ER. The elevation of E₂ level in peripheral blood might be related to the overexpression of ER.","title":"[Study on the relationship between estrogen receptor expression and level of serum sexual hormones in male patients with lung cancer].","pubmedId":"21329603"}
