We have defined a general cohort of breast cancers in terms of putative actionable targets, involving growth and proliferative factors, the cell cycle, and apoptotic pathways, both as single biomarkers across a general cohort and within intrinsic molecular subtypes.We identified 293 patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Additional hormonal therapy and trastuzumab was administered depending on hormonal and HER2 status respectively. We performed immunohistochemistry for ER, PR, HER2, MM1, CK5/6, p53, TOP2A, EGFR, IGF1R, PTEN, p-mTOR and e-cadherin. The cohort was classified into luminal (62%) and non-luminal (38%) tumors as well as luminal A (27%), luminal B HER2 negative (22%) and positive (12%), HER2 enriched (14%) and triple negative (25%). Patients with luminal tumors and co-overexpression of TOP2A or IGF1R loss displayed worse overall survival (p\u003d0.0251 and p\u003d0.0008 respectively). Non-luminal tumors had much greater heterogeneous expression profiles with no individual markers of prognostic significance. Non-luminal tumors were characterised by EGFR and TOP2A overexpression, IGF1R, PTEN and p-mTOR negativity and extreme p53 expression.Our results indicate that only a minority of intrinsic subtype tumors purely express single novel actionable targets. This lack of pure biomarker expression is particular prevalent in the triple negative subgroup and may allude to the mechanism of targeted therapy inaction and myriad disappointing trial results. Utilising a combinatorial biomarker approach may enhance studies of targeted therapies providing additional information during design and patient selection while also helping decipher negative trial results.","title":"Defining a therapeutic classification of breast cancer by actionable targets","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1905"}
