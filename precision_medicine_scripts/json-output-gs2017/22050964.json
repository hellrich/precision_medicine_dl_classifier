In this study, we identified 11 patients with pCR (2.5%) from 442 patients with PDA who received neoadjuvant treatment and pancreatectomy from 1995 to 2010. There were 6 men and 5 women, with a median age of 61 years. Four patients had either synchronous or history of extrapancreatic cancer. Five patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation, and 6 received chemoradiation alone. Ten patients had pancreaticoduodenectomy, and 1 had distal pancreatectomy. Scar and chronic pancreatitis consistent with therapy effect were present in all cases (100%). Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) 3/carcinoma in situ was present in 5 cases, and PanIN1 and PanIN2 in 5 cases. However, no residual invasive carcinoma or lymph node metastasis was identified in all cases. Follow-up information was available in 10 patients. Follow-up time ranges from 6 to 194 months (median, 63 months). During the follow-up, 3 patients died of other causes, and 1 developed a second primary PDA in the tail of the pancreas at 84 months after the initial pancreaticoduodenectomy and died at 105 months after the initial diagnosis of PDA. The other 6 patients were alive with no evidence of disease. Patients with pCR had a better survival than did those who had posttherapy stage I or IIA disease (P \u003c .001). Patients with PDA who received neoadjuvant therapy and had pCR in pancreatectomy are rare but have a better prognosis.","title":"Pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is associated with a better prognosis.","pubmedId":"22050964"}
