Small cell lung cancer was diagnosed from pathological examination of a specimen of the tumor obtained by transbronchial biopsy. Paraneoplastic Cushing\u0027s syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of an elevated serum ACTH level (2000 pg/ml), the serum cortisol level (171.9 micrograms/dl), elevated excretion of urinary 17-OHCS (67 mg/day), persistent hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperglycemia, central obesity, hypertension, systemic pigmentation, and the lack of a history of diabetes mellitus. Immunohistochemical staining with a polyclonal anti-ACTH antibody of a biopsy specimen from a lymph node with metastasis showed that tumor cells were weakly positive. The patient responded well to intensive chemotherapy with VP-16 (100 mg/m2 day 103), CBDCA (100 mg/m2 day 1-3), and CDDP (80 mg/m2 day 1). Complete response was obtained after 6 courses of chemotherapy. The serum ACTH level decreased rapidly as the tumor shrank. The primary tumor, however, relapsed after 3 months and the patient died of progressive disease, 11 months after diagnosis.","title":"[Small cell lung cancer associated with ectopic ACTH syndrome].","pubmedId":"8622281"}
