The 5-year survival rate for all patients who exhibited an EGFR mutation was similar to those who were free of such mutations (71% vs. 56%, P \u003d 0.252). However, the 5-year survival rate of patients with either a stage I adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma who had an EGFR mutation was significantly greater than for those who did not have such a mutation (92% vs. 57%, P \u003d 0.037).\nEGFR gene mutations were significantly associated with higher EGFR expression, but not with p-Akt or p-MAPK status. In early stage NSCLC, the presence of an EGFR gene mutation bode well for the patient\u0027s prognosis.","title":"Influence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations on the expression of EGFR, phosphoryl-Akt, and phosphoryl-MAPK, and on the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"17192868"}
