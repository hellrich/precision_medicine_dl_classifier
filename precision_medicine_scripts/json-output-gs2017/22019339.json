Basal-like and luminal breast carcinomas were defined by the IHC evaluation of these markers. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed for PTEN and HER2 analysis using the Vysis PTEN and HER2 DNA probe kits (Abbottâ„¢). RT-PCR was performed to evaluate gene expressions of MGMT and PTEN in frozen tissue of 59/200 cases.\n147/200 cases were triple-negative (73.5%), 47/147 were basal-like carcinomas (31.9%). 53 cases (26.5%) were luminal-like type A or B. 56 (93.3%) and 46 samples (76.6%) expressed lower levels of MGMT and PTEN mRNA, respectively, compared with normal breast (p\u003c0.001). There was a positive correlation between the IHC results and the RT-PCR values for MGMT and PTEN. Tumors with homozygotic deletion of PTEN expressed little or no mRNA or protein. Positive p53, high Ki67, and basal-like tumors expressed significant lower MGMT and PTEN.\nWe hypothesize that MGMT and PTEN expressions have prognostic significance in breast cancer. Also, based on their predictive value of response to therapy, evaluating MGMT and PTEN and learning to interpret their patterns of immunoexpression will undoubtedly lead to a greater understanding of breast cancer and its treatment.","title":"MGMT and PTEN as potential prognostic markers in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"22019339"}
