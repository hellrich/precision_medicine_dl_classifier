In the present study, we identified a novel splice RNA variant, designated NRDRA2, of the human DHRS4 gene by RT-PCR, 3\u0027 RACE, and 5\u0027 RACE. NRDRA2 mRNA lacked exons 4 and 6, and had a shift in the reading frame when compared to DHRS4 mRNA, resulting in loss of the peroxisomal targeting signal of NRDR and gain of a nuclear localization signal in the predicted NRDRA2 protein. Endogenous NRDRA2 protein was identified in the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric assay. A green fluorescent protein reporter assay showed that NRDRA2 protein mainly localized to the nuclei, confirming the sequence at its C-terminus as a legitimate nuclear localization signal sequence. This study identifies the alternative transcript variant NRDRA2 encoding a subcellular nuclear localized NRDRA2 protein.","title":"Identification of a novel isoform of DHRS4 protein with a nuclear localization signal.","pubmedId":"22227495"}
