The E6 and E7 oncoproteins interact with tumor suppressor genes p53 and pRb, culminating with the p16(INK4a) overexpression. The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of HPV-DNA in 174 cervical biopsies and correlate the different histological grades with the p16(INK4a) and Ki67 immunohistochemical expression (IHC). A cross-sectional study that enrolled a total of 174 women who underwent uterine cervical biopsies between February 2003 and December 2006, in southern Brazil, was performed. Cervical smear samples were analyzed for the presence of HPV-DNA through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and biopsy samples were examined for p16(INK4A) and Ki67 expression through IHC techniques. The presence of HPV-DNA was observed in 89% of the tested patients, among which 52% were positive for high-risk (HR) viral types [16, 18 and 31]. Regarding p16(INK4a), an expression of 69% was observed, being expressed in 100% of the high-grade squamous lesions (HSIL) and HR-HPV-DNA positives. Ki67 expression was associated with the lesion grade, being more expressive in the most severe lesions (p\u003c0.001). p16(INK4A) and Ki67 markers coexpression was present in 86% of the samples (p\u003c0.001), being 100% among those positive to HR-HPV-DNA with HSIL (p\u003c0.001). The results suggest an association between the presence of HR-HPV infection and the p16(INK4a) and Ki67 expression and which is even stronger among women with HSIL.
