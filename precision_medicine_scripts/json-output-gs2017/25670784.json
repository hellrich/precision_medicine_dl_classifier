We report on the case of an 80-year-old left-handed man who presented with recurrent focal motor seizures and secondary generalisation. A large left-sided parieto-occipital cystic mass was detected on contrast CT of the brain. The appearance suggested a malignant tumour. However, brain MRI with gadolinium delineated the solid and cystic component precisely. A provisional diagnosis of cystic meningioma was made and this was confirmed histologically after resecting the tumour surgically. It was a benign WHO Grade I fibroblastic meningioma. The preoperative diagnosis of cystic meningioma is not that straightforward. Brain MRI with gadolinium has a better diagnostic yield than CT scanning. Histopathological examination of the tumour cells should always be performed to confirm the category and subtype of the tumour. ","title":"Cystic meningioma.","pubmedId":"25670784"}
