As a result of treatment, light-microscopic changes led to total regression. Electronmicroscopically, in the florid state, destruction of small-bowel epithelial cells was observed, mostly in the Lieberk√ºhn\u0027s crypts. The changes of epithelial cells regressed after one year of treatment. In the lamina propria, a large amount of macrophages containing characteristic inclusions were found which persisted even after treatment. The composition of inclusions has, however, changed. The macrophages were cells poor in organelles and of a primitive differentiation. Presumably, this morphological picture is associated with the digestion incapability of cells and this may lead to the development of \"acquired storage disease\".","title":"Repeated light- and electron microscopic studies of the small-bowel mucosa in Whipple\u0027s disease.","pubmedId":"89968"}
