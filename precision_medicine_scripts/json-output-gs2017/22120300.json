Of these, 18 patients were treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Cushing provided basic demographic, perioperative, and outcomes data in his tables, but the operative details for many of his early meningioma cases have not been previously described.\nAfter institutional review board approval, and through the courtesy of the Alan Mason Chesney Archives, the surgical files for the Johns Hopkins Hospital from the period 1896 to 1912 were reviewed. Cases diagnosed as endothelioma or dural endothelioma were selected for further analysis.\nOf the 14 patients with available records, 1 were male. The mean age was 34.4 years. Nine patients (64.3%) died during their inpatient stay. Cushing used staged resections in an attempt to minimize blood loss, morbidity, and mortality, albeit with limited success.\nThe operative details demonstrate Cushing\u0027s early attention to hemostasis, and use of staged resections in patients with large, highly vascular meningiomas. Cushing\u0027s first 18 cases of meningiomas, treated while a young attending physician at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, are not the most elegant operations in his lengthy series, but serve as an illustration of his ability to transform clinical challenges into opportunities for improvement.","title":"Harvey Cushing\u0027s early treatment of meningiomas: the untold story.","pubmedId":"22120300"}
