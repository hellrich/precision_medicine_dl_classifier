The NF2 tumor-suppressor gene encodes for the merlin/schwannomin protein, which is responsible for the inherited disease neurofibromatosis 2. NF2 gene mutations predominantly occur in transitional and fibroblastic meningiomas, whereas the meningothelial variant is less affected. Secretory meningioma is an infrequent meningioma subtype. Its most typical morphologic feature is the presence of intracytoplasmic or extracytoplasmic round hyaline, eosinophilic, and periodic acid Shiff-positive bodies in a lesion frequently otherwise classifiable as meningothelial meningioma. This study reviews the immunohistochemical merlin expression in 14 consecutive secretory meningiomas. Our purpose was to investigate if secretory meningiomas, analogous to meningothelial meningiomas, follow a molecular route of pathogenesis independent of the neurorofibromatosis 2 gene-associated pathway. All meningiomas showed positive immunocoloration involving the majority of the hyaline inclusions and secretory cells; in 12 (86%) meningiomas, a positive immunoreaction was also documented in nonsecretory tumoral cells. Our results may indicate a molecular, besides morphologic, similarity between secretory and meningothelial meningiomas: the almost constant merlin immunohistochemical expression in our series gives evidence for a possible NF2 gene-independent pathogenesis in secretory meningiomas.","title":"Merlin expression in secretory meningiomas: evidence of an NF2-independent pathogenesis?
