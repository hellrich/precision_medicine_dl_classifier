Left epigastric evisceration and extensive dissection of lymph nodes including the para-aortic nodes should be done for sufficient extirpation of the tissues around the stomach. Adjuvant therapy is recommended for intensive chemotherapy immediately after surgery and for postoperative long-term maintenance therapy. Development of a combined therapy which takes into account the characteristics of scirrhous gastric cancer is hoped for in the future.","title":"[Surgical treatment of scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach].","pubmedId":"3017227"}
