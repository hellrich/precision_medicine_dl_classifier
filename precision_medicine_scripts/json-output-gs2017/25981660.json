A liver tumor was identified in segments 5 to 6 in a 60-year-old male asymptomatic hepatitis B carrier. The tumor was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma by MRI and CT. However, following its resection by extended posterior segmentectomy of the liver, pathological findings identified it as an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The surgical margin was cancer-negative. No additional adjuvant chemotherapy was administered because of the patient \u0027s impaired renal function. When tumor recurrence was found by MRI 30 months later, an additional liver resection was planned but a laparotomy was eventually performed. This was because intraoperative findings revealed Glissonian sheath invasion with involvement of the umbilical portion. S-1 treatment(100mg/body/day)was started. Although the dose had to be reduced(mostly 75mg/body/day)due to hyperbilirubinemia and there were some interruptions in the regimen, in total of 42 g of S-1 was administered. The patient is currently still alive, 6 years after the detection of the tumor recurrence. This represents a rare case in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
