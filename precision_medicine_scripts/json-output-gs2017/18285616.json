In this study we examined in mice whether pharmacological intervention using statins in late pregnancy could alleviate the detrimental effects of a high-fat, high-cholesterol (45% fat) maternal diet on the health of the dams and their offspring. Pregnant C57 mice on high-fat, high-cholesterol diet were given the 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pravastatin in the drinking water (5 mg/kg of body weight per day) in the second half of pregnancy and during lactation to lower cholesterol and improve postweaning maternal blood pressure. Weaned offspring were then fed the high-fat, high-cholesterol diet until adulthood (generating dam/offspring dietary groups high-fat, high-cholesterol/high-fat, high-cholesterol and high-fat, high-cholesterol plus pravastatin during the second half of pregnancy and lactation/high-fat, high-cholesterol). These groups were compared with offspring from mothers fed standard chow (control), which were then fed control diet to adulthood (control/control). Compared with high-fat, high-cholesterol, high-fat, high-cholesterol plus pravastatin during second half of pregnancy and lactation dams showed significantly reduced total cholesterol concentrations and reduced systolic blood pressure. The high-fat, high-cholesterol plus pravastatin during second half of pregnancy and lactation/high-fat, high-cholesterol offspring were significantly lighter, less hypertensive, and more active compared with the high-fat, high-cholesterol/high-fat, high-cholesterol group. Total serum and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were raised in high-fat, high-cholesterol plus pravastatin during the second half of pregnancy and lactation/high-fat, high-cholesterol offspring, compared with the high-fat, high-cholesterol/high-fat, high-cholesterol group. The control/control offspring showed the lowest blood pressure and cholesterol levels. These findings indicate that the cholesterol-lowering effect of statins in pregnant dams consuming a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet leads to reduced cardiovascular risk factors in offspring that are sustained into adulthood.","title":"Statin treatment in hypercholesterolemic pregnant mice reduces cardiovascular risk factors in their offspring.","pubmedId":"18285616"}
