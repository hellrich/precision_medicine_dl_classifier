[1991] Dev. Biol. 146:139-147; Sugi et al. [1993] Dev. Biol. 157:28-37). Because these findings inferred the presence of a functional receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGFR), we have immunochemically assessed the appearance of FGFR-1 (cek-1; flg) during development. Using a peptide-generated antibody, Western blots of total embryonic proteins revealed that FGFR-1 was barely detectable at pre-heart stages, followed by sequential increases in relative abundance that peaked at stage 24, followed by a decline at days 7-14. Western blots of proteins from isolated embryonic hearts demonstrated a similar developmental pattern, except that FGFR-1 expression was not decreased at later stages. The presence of FGFR-1 mRNA was verified by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) amplification. Immunohistochemical examination revealed punctate deposits of FGFR-1 in the precardiac endoderm at stage 6, followed by detection in the endoderm, foregut, and pre-cardiac splanchnic mesoderm at stage 8 and in the newly formed myocardium at the heart tube stage (9/10). By stage 13, FGFR-1 staining was observed only in the myocardium, a pattern which persisted at least until stage 30 (day 7), after which only isolated hearts were examined. After stage 30, staining was diminished in the ventricle, but not in the atrium. Staining of cardiac endothelial cells was not observed at any stage. A functional role for FGFR-1 was indicated by experiments in which anti-FGFR-1, but not pre-absorbed antiserum, retarded proliferation and multilayering of cardiogenic cells in an in vitro model of cardiac morphogenesis.","title":"Developmental expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (cek-1; flg) during heart development.","pubmedId":"7734730"}
