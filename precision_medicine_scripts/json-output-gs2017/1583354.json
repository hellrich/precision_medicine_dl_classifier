The expression of those protooncogenes was detected in total mRNA from all specimens. However, the amounts in carcinomas and in normal tissues differed. C-Ki-ras mRNA in all the tumors was expressed up to sixfold more than in normal tissues. C-fos mRNA was also overexpressed up to tenfold in four of five tumors. In contrast, c-myc mRNA levels were varied and did not differ significantly between tumors and normal tissues. The results suggest that the overexpression of c-Ki-ras and c-fos mRNA are implicated in the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"Overexpression of c-Ki-ras and c-fos in human pancreatic carcinomas.","pubmedId":"1583354"}
