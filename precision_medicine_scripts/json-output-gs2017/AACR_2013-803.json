While many Grade I meningiomas are cured by surgery, 20% recur and are minimally responsive to systemic therapy. Meningiomas of higher grades are particularly challenging to treat and are associated with a poor prognosis. Though the tumor suppressor gene NF2 has been linked to meningiomagenesis, the spectrum of genetic changes in meningiomas remains poorly understood, particularly in the large subset of tumors without NF2 alterations. We performed whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing on 17 meningiomas and focused sequencing using a 645 gene-set on an additional 48 tumors. The majority of meningiomas exhibited simple genomes, with fewer copy-number alterations, mutations, and rearrangements compared to other adult tumors. However, several meningiomas harbored more complex patterns of copy-number changes and rearrangements including one tumor with chromothripsis. We confirmed focal NF2 inactivation in 43% of tumors. A subset of NF2-wildtype meningiomas harbored recurrent oncogenic mutations in AKT1 and the Hedgehog pathway regulator SMO. Tumors with these mutations varied histologically from their NF2-mutated counterparts, and exhibited immunohistochemical evidence of pathway activation. These results begin to define the spectrum of genetic alterations in meningiomas. Our findings of known driver oncogenic mutations including AKT1 and SMO have immediate therapeutic potential.","title":"Genomic sequencing of meningiomas reveals oncogenic SMO and AKT1 mutations.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-803"}
