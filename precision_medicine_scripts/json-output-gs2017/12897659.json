Liver and peritoneum are the most frequent metastatic sites. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment in patients with localized disease. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ), an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity of KIT receptor, has been shown to be an effective treatment in metastatic or unresectable disease. Follow-up of patients treated with Gleevec is controversial. The authors present a case of GIST that showed near-total response with Gleevec on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. They suggest positron emission tomography as a useful imaging modality for the monitoring of therapy response in GIST tumors treated with Gleevec.","title":"F-18 FDG PET imaging in gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","pubmedId":"12897659"}
