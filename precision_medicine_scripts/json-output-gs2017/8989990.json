Freshly isolated cancer cells were collected from pleural effusions in adenocarcinoma patients by centrifugation with a Percoll gradient. Adenoviral vectors resulted in effective gene transduction into human lung cancer cell lines and into freshly isolated lung adenocarcinoma cells. In an experiment using the beta-galactosidase (LacZ) gene, the Adex1CA vector with a regulatory sequence of chicken beta-actin as promoter and an enhancer derived from cytomegalovirus produced a higher transduction ratio and greater expression levels than adenoviral vectors with other promoter systems. Transduction with Adex1CA vectors containing the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene (Adex1CAhIL-2) resulted in enhanced secretion of IL-2 from gene-modified lung cancer cells. Treatment with normal human serum inhibited gene transduction by Adex1CAhIL-2 but did not inhibit gene expression after transduction by Adex1CAhIL-2. The secretion of IL-2 from the gene-modified cells, which were irradiated at 100 Gy before transduction, continued for 8 days. In a mouse model, the intrapleural injection of IL-2 gene-modified 3LL cells transduced by Adex1CAhIL-2 could cure the pre-existing lung tumours with malignant pleural effusions to induce tumor-specific immunity. But these therapies did not show any therapeutic benefit on the pre-existing tumor in subcutaneous region. These data suggest a potentially useful but limited clinical role of Adex1CAhIL-2 in gene therapy for lung cancer patients.","title":"Interleukin-2 gene transduction into freshly isolated lung adenocarcinoma cells with adenoviral vectors.","pubmedId":"8989990"}
