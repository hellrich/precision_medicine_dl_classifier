About 20% of HER2+ breast cancer patients have PIK3CA mutation, which has resulted in a trend toward shorter progression-free survival with trastuzumab-based therapy. Resistance (intrinsic or acquired) to trastuzumab is a significant clinical challenge, partly due to the overriding activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. The PI3K pathway activation leads to stimulation of the key growth and proliferation regulatory kinase, mTOR which can be blocked by allosteric inhibitors (rapalogous) or by ATP-comptetive mTOR kinase inhibitor (TORC1/2). Purpose: We investigated the effects of INK128; a potent and selective TORC1/2 kinase inhibitor alone or in conjunction with trastuzumab in HER2 amplified breast tumor cell lines. We also sought to identify the molecular response determinants of mTOR kinase inhibitor predicting potent activity in HER2+/trastuzumab-resistant cell lines. Experimental Design: Here, we used the HER2 amplified trastuzumab-sensitive breast tumor cell line (BT474), the trastuzumab-resistant breast tumor cell line (BT474HR) and HER2 amplified/PIK3CA mutated breast tumor cell lines (HCC1954, UACC893). Results: We demonstrate that 1) HER2+ cells are sensitive to INK128 (IC50 40nM), 2) INK128 is also effective in trastuzumab-resistant and PIK3CA mutaed/HER2+ breast tumor cells (IC50 20 and 20-30nM respectively), 3) INK128 is mechanistically distinct from rapalogous by a more potent and comprehensive inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network: a) avoids S6K inhibition-mediated feedback activation of PI3K-AKT and b) abrogates 4EBP1 phosphorylation; 4) ligand-induced HIF1 accumulation is inhibited by prior treatment of INK128, and 5) the combination of trastuzumab plus INK128 more effectively blocked PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling and HIF1 accumulation both in parental and trastuzumab-resistant cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that i) therapeutic targeting of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling should be effective in abrogating resistance to trastuzumab therapy in HER2+ breast cancer, ii) combination of trastuzumab and INK128 is a promising treatment approach for HER2 overexpressed as well as trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer patients and iii) dual TORC1/2 inhibitor also mitigates the feedback activation of AKT caused by selective inhibition of mTORC1, and because of this, INK128 may yield greater therapeutic benefit in breast cancer patients.","title":"Pre-clinical potency of INK128, a highly potent TORC1/2 kinase inhibitor in the HER2 amplified breast cancer model","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2240"}
