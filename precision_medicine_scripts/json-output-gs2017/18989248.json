Case 1. An asymptomatic 93-year-old man was diagnosed as having non-small cell lung cancer with clinical T1N0M0 stage IA disease, and a right upper lobectomy was performed via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Mediastinal dissection was omitted. He was discharged on postoperative day 16, and he remains well without recurrence 6 months after the operation. Case 2. A 92-year-old man was diagnosed as having non-small cell lung cancer with clinical T2N0M0 stage IB disease and diminished pulmonary function. A right lower lobectomy with complicated partial resection of the diaphragm was performed via axillary thoracotomy with thoracoscopic support. He was discharged on postoperative day 28 and is well 42 months after the surgery. Although the feasibility of pulmonary resection in a nonagenarian could not be confirmed from only these two cases, pulmonary resection is a possible treatment option for lung cancer in selected nonagenarians.","title":"Lung cancer surgery in nonagenarians.","pubmedId":"18989248"}
