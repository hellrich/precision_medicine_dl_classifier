We used the peptic nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid clamp method to determine their EGFR somatic mutation status. We evaluated the relationship between each independent clinicopathological variable and the response to gefitinib therapy and the risk factors associated with prognosis.\nHaving CRP-positive serum and having wild-type EGFR were both independent negative predictive factors for the response to gefitinib treatment by multivariate logistic regression model analysis. Having CRP-positive serum and having wild-type EGFR were significant independent negative prognostic factors for survival based on multivariate analysis.\nHaving CRP-positive serum predicted a lack of response to gefitinib therapy independent of EGFR mutational status. Both CRP-positive serum and wild-type EGFR were independent poor prognostic factors in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC who received gefitinib therapy.","title":"Clinical significance of pretreatment C-reactive protein in patients with advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer who received gefitinib.","pubmedId":"21430404"}
