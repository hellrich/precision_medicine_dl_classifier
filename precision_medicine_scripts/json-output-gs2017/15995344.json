MRS has been used to measure tissue concentrations of proton-containing compounds such as organic and amino acids, and sugars in living tissues. We have used MRS in a 26-year-old female with suspected cervical and endometrial carcinomas. With the use of the above mentioned technique, biochemical differences in the endometrium and the cervix tissues were detected. The presented case is the first virgin patient in the relevant literature in whom endometrial and cervical carcinoma was detected. Choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), lipid and lactate region of the MRS spectrum suggested that the technique could be used as an indicator of metabolic alterations in the cervical and endometrial tumor cells.","title":"Synchronous endometrial and cervical tumors in a 26-year-old nullipara: diagnostic modalities updated.","pubmedId":"15995344"}
