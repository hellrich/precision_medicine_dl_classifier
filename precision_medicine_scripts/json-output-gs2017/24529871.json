The MTT assay results indicated that BK10040 was cytotoxic against human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and pancreatic cancer (MiaPaCa2) cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 2.25 and 0.93Î¼M, respectively, which is ca. 2-fold more potent than lead compound KYS05090 despite of its decreased T-type calcium channel blockade. As a mode of action for cytotoxic effect of BK10040 on lung cancer (A549) cells, this cancer cell death was found to have the typical features of apoptosis, as evidenced by the accumulation of positive cells for annexin V. In addition, BK10040 triggered the activations of caspases 3 and 9, and the cleavages of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Moreover, the treatment with z-VAD-fmk (a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor) significantly prevented BK10040-induced apoptosis. Based on these results, BK10040 may be used as a potential therapeutic agent for human lung cancer via the potent apoptotic activity.
