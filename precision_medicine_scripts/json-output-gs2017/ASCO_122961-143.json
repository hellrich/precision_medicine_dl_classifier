Here, we evaluated the effect of POCs on survival after surgery for gastric cancer in a cohort of patients from a multi-institutional database.  Methods:  Patients who underwent surgery with curative intent for gastric adenocarcinoma between 2000-2012 from participating institutions of the U.S. Gastric Cancer Collaborative were analyzed. Patients who died within 30 days of surgery were excluded. Ninety-day postoperative complication data were collected. Survival probabilities were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test.  Results:  A total of 853 patients from seven institutions met inclusion criteria.  Median follow-up was 32 months. The overall complication rate was 40% (n\u003d344).  The most frequent complications were: infectious (25%, including surgical site infection [8%]), and anastomotic leak (6%). 7% of patients underwent reoperation during the same hospitalization. Five-year overall survival (OS) for patients without perioperative complications was 54%, compared with 39% for patients with POCs (p\u003d0.001). Disease free survival (DFS) at five years was 61% for patients without POCs compared to 49% in patients with POCs (p\u003d0.002). Patients without POCs were significantly more likely to receive adjuvant therapy (55% vs 42%; p\u003c0.001).  Conclusions:  In a large, multi-institutional cohort, POCs were associated with decreased survival in patients undergoing surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma.  This may be due, in part, to the negative impact of complications on the receipt of adjuvant therapy.  Efforts aimed at reducing perioperative morbidity are important not only for short-term surgical outcomes, but also for enhancing long-term oncologic outcomes in patients with gastric cancer.
