An average Ki-67 proliferation index of 28% was ascertained for the original and recurrent lesions. These findings established the diagnosis of a well-differentiated liposarcoma with lipoma-like and spindle cell features and ruled out a spindle cell lipoma.\nWell-differentiated liposarcoma is a slow growing, infiltrative, and nonmetastasizing neoplasm that is microscopically and diagnostically challenging. It can be reliably separated from a benign spindle cell or an atypical lipoma by using the markers MDM2 and Ki-67.","title":"MDM2-positive atypical lipomatous neoplasm/well-differentiated liposarcoma versus spindle cell lipoma of the orbit.","pubmedId":"20639786"}
