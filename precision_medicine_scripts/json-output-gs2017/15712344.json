Somatic activating mutations of this gene have recently been detected in several types of cancers. In the present study, 109 advanced ovarian carcinomas were analyzed for PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 and exon 20 by direct sequencing. Activating missense mutations were observed in 4 of the 109 tumors in addition to one variant leading no change of the PIK3CA protein. Two of the cases with mutations were mucinous and clear cell tumors, suggesting that PIK3CA mutations are more common in these rare histological types.","title":"PIK3CA mutations in advanced ovarian carcinomas.","pubmedId":"15712344"}
