However, its expression in cervical carcinoma has not been reported. The ASK1 and claudin-6 expression in cervical carcinoma tissues and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression of ASK1 and claudin-6 in cervical cancer carcinoma cells was detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and western blot. The expression level of ASK1 was down-regulated in cervical carcinoma tissues compared with the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues and positively correlated with the level of claudin-6 in cervical carcinoma cells and tissues. Our present study reveals that ASK1 protein expression altered between human cervical carcinoma and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. The expression of ASK1 is correlated with the level of claudin-6 in cervical carcinoma cells and tissues.
