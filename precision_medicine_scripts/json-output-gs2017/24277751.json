Approximately 50% of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors harbor an anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion gene. Pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors harboring tropomyosin3-anaplastic lymphoma kinase or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type F polypeptide-interacting protein-binding protein 1-anaplastic lymphoma kinase have been reported previously. However, it has not been reported that inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors harbor echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion gene which is considered to be very specific to lung cancers. A few tumors harboring echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion gene other than lung cancers have been reported and the tumors were all carcinomas. A 67-year-old man had been followed up for a benign tumor for approximately 3 years before the tumor demonstrated malignant transformation. Lobectomy and autopsy revealed that an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor harboring echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion gene had transformed into an undifferentiated sarcoma. This case suggests that echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion is an oncogenic event in not only carcinomas but also sarcomas originating from stromal cells.
