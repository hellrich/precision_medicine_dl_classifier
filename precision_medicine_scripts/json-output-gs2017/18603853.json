In August 2005, abdominal CT revealed a tumor 20mm in diameter in the pancreatic tail, therefore, a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. The pancreatic tumor resembled the moderately differentiated cecal adenocarcinoma, both having p53 and k-ras point mutations in common, and it was diagnosed as a metastasis of the cecal carcinoma.","title":"[A resected case of metastatic pancreatic cancer from cecal carcinoma].","pubmedId":"18603853"}
