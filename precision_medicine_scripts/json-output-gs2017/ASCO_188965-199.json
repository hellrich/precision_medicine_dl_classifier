Absence of biallelic deletion of TCR- (ABD), a marker of immaturity, and CDKN2A/2B deletion have been identified as poor predictors of outcome in T-ALL treated with contemporary protocols. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between ABD and CDKN2A/2B in Indian T-ALL patients. Methods: A total of 31 cases of T-ALL, diagnosed on morphology, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping, were included in the study. The age of the patients ranged from 1-50 years. The patients were investigated for CDKN2A/2B deletion by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) using the commercially available probe set P383 (MRC Holland). The status of the deletion of TCR-  was determined using quantitative assay described by Gutierrez et al.1Results: Absence of biallelic deletion of TCR-  gene were found in 14 (45.16%) patients. Homozygous deletion was seen in 13 (41.93%) patients while monoallelic deletion was seen in 5 (16.12%) patients. CDKN2A/2B deletions were found in (48.38%) patients. On correlation of CDKN2A/2B deletion and TCR-  deletion, it was found that CDKN2A/2B deletion was found in 2/14 (14.28%) patients with ABD and 10/13 (76.92%) patients with homozygous deletion. Conclusions: CDKN2A/2B deletion are more common in patients with homozygous deletion of TCR-  gene.","title":"Association of CDKN2A/2B deletion with homozygous deletion of TCR-  gene in T-ALL.","pubmedId":"ASCO_188965-199"}
