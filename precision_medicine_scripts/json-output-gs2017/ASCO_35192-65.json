{"publicationTypes":["2009 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: Pancreas represents an uncommon site of metastasis in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The natural history of pancreatic metastases is largely unknown, and efficacy of targeted agents has never been assessed. We examined the outcome in a series of RCC patients (pts) with pancreatic metastases, treated by either surgery or antiangiogenic therapy. Methods: We reviewed the charts of RCC pts treated for pancreatic metastases, between 2001 and 2008, in Institut Gustave Roussy and Piti-Salpetrire Hospital. Data base was reviewed to determine presentation, clinical symptoms, pancreatic metastases treatment, use of systemic therapy , disease-free survival (DFS) or progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after treatment. Results: A total of 40 pts with pancreatic metastases from RCC have been analyzed. Median age was 63 years (range: 48-81), sex ratio M/F was 29/11, and metastases occurred initially (synchroneous) in 9 pts, while they were metachronous in 31 pts. Most of the metastases were asymptomatic (87%), detected on routine CT scans, while only 12% were symptomatic (pain, cholestasis). Surgical resection of pancreatic metastases was performed in 8 (20%) patients, and DFS and OS were 45 and 66 months. In patients with multiple metastatic sites (lung : 20 (50%) ; liver : 8 (20%) ; thyroid : 3(7%)), therapeutic approaches have included antiangiogenic therapies (75%): sorafenib (20 pts), sunitinib (7 pts), bevacizumab (2 pts), Torisel (1 pt). Best response was partial response in 30% of pts and stable disease in 50% of pts. Median PFS and OS were 21 months and 30 months. Conclusions: Patients with RCC pancreatic metastases seem to have a longer survival than the usual metastatic RCC pts. Surgical resection must be discussed in pauci-metastatic disease, as it can be associated with prolonged survival. Antiangiogenic therapies are active in these patients with high response rate and prolonged survival.","title":"Pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma: Presentation, recurrence, survival, and response to antiangiogenic therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_35192-65"}
