These involve specific binding of IGFBP-2 to alpha5beta1-integrin, followed by alterations in the phosphorylation status of downstream signaling molecules. Previously, IGFBP-2 has also been shown to be associated with cell proliferation, adhesion and migration. Here, we investigated direct effects of IGFBP-2 on apoptosis and alterations in the expression of related proteins. The breast cancer cell line Hs578T, which shows no IGFBP-2 production of its own and is independent of the IGF-I receptor, was treated with human recombinant IGFBP-2 in order to study the changes in gene expression induced by IGFBP-2. The methods employed for this purpose were oligonucleotide microarrays, real-time RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunoassays. Out of the 440 genes covered by the Oligo GEArray Human Cancer Microarray OHS-802, the expression of 77 genes was directly influenced by IGFBP-2. By the use of real-time quantitative RT-PCR, the gene expression of Nuclear Factor (NF)kappaB, p53, transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta-1), LAMB1 (Laminin, Beta 1), Bcl-2, and IIp45 was found to be significantly upregulated (by 1.2- to 3.05-fold; all P \u003c 0.001). Accordingly, NFkappaB, p53, and TGF beta-1 proteins, as measured by Western blotting and immunoassay, were upregulated \u003e 1.5-fold. By using an ELISA-based and a flow cytometry-based apoptosis assay, IGFBP-2 was found to have a pro-apoptotic effect on Hs578T cells. Our results suggest that IGFBP-2-induced gene expressions are of functional significance for proliferation, cell adhesion, cell migration and apoptosis, and showed that IGFBP-2 can promote apoptosis in tumor cells independent of IGF.","title":"IGF-independent effects of IGFBP-2 on the human breast cancer cell line Hs578T.","pubmedId":"16901920"}
