Histologic examination of a percutaneous needle biopsy specimen showed mucinous pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma should be added to the list of systemic diseases that can be associated with Purtscher-like retinopathy.","title":"Purtscher-like retinopathy associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"10577543"}
