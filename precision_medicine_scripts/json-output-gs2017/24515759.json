The resulting slides were scored for proportion and intensity of staining.\nLoss of tumor nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for PTEN occurred in 48.3% of cases and was significantly associated with younger age at diagnosis (47 years compared with 57 years in those without PTEN loss; P \u003d .005). Independent predictors of PTEN loss were late stage at presentation (P \u003d .026), cytokeratin 5/6 positivity (P \u003d .028), and IGFBP2 expression (P \u003d .042). High levels of IGFBP2 expression were seen in 32% of cases; an independent predictor of high levels was cytokeratin 14 negativity (P \u003d .005). PTEN loss and high levels of IGFBP2 expression were associated with poorer survival, but neither of these trends was significant.\nPTEN loss is a frequent event in triple-negative breast cancers and is significantly associated with younger age at onset of breast cancer, late stage, and IGFBP2 expression.","title":"Loss of PTEN expression is associated with IGFBP2 expression, younger age, and late stage in triple-negative breast cancer.","pubmedId":"24515759"}
