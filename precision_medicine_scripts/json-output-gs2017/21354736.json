Seven cases had no clear boundary, peritumoral brain edema was obvious and adjacent brain tissues were invaded to varying degrees. After plain MRI scans, the focuses of seven cases exhibited lower-isointense signal in T1WI, five cases revealed higher-isointense signal and two cases showed lower-isointense signal in T2WI. Enhancement scans demonstrated marked enhancement in seven cases, and the meninges in six cases thicken irregularly and extensively. Pathology showed the richness and diversity of cells, an infiltration containing plasma cells and lymphocytes, as well as the unequal areas of neoplastic spindle cells and meninge epithelial cells.\nLymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma is a subtype meningioma of WHO I-grade, which is seldom seen and whose imaging appearances are varied from ordinary meningioma. Its features include growing flat along the meninges, irregular forms, unclear boundary, obvious edema, notable strengthening effect, usual invasion of adjacent brain tissues, and similar inflammation.","title":"An analysis of the magnetic resonance imaging and pathology of intracal lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma.","pubmedId":"21354736"}
