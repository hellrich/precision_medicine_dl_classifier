However its prognostic value compared to markers as the estrogen receptor is currently unclear. The expression levels of SATB1 mRNA from Affymetrix microarray in a cohort of 2058 breast cancer samples and its prognostic impact were analyzed. There was no significant difference in disease-free survival among ER negative cancers but instead a benefit for high SATB1 expression among ER positive tumors (p \u003d 0.042). However, even in ER positive cancer no independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis with standard parameters was observed. Thus the use of SATB1 as target or prognostic marker for breast cancer should be viewed with caution and a possible confounding effect of the estrogen receptor status of the tumor should be taken into account when analysing new markers as SATB1.","title":"SATB1 gene expression and breast cancer prognosis.","pubmedId":"20980149"}
