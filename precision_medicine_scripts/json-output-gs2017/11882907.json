We performed two colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for Her-2/neu and chromosome 17 and compared the FISH results with the immunohistochemical overexpression of Her-2/neu protein by 2 antibodies (DAKO HercepTest and the BioGenex monoclonal antibody AM 134-5M). Furthermore, following radical mastectomy with axillary dissection, Her-2/neu status of the patients were compared with the well known histopathological prognostic factors such as histologic grade, tumor stage, lympho/ vascular invasion, surgical margin status and Paget s disease. Amplification was demonstrated 27% of the cases. Her-2/neu protein overexpression was detected in 47% and 80% of the cases with CB11 and HercepTest respectively. We revealed statistically significant association between the tumor, oncoprotein expression and oncogene amplification (p\u003c0.05). The results of our study showed that combination of IHC and FISH methods enhances the evaluation of tumor genetics at both gene and protein level for the analysis of Her-2/neu in breast carcinoma.","title":"Her-2/neu gene amplification compared with HER-2/neu protein overexpression on ultrasound guided core-needle biopsy specimens of breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11882907"}
