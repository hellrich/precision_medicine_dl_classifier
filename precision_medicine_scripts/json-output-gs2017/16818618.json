In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the presence of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase correlates with clinical response to small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here, we show that cells harboring the G776insV_G/C mutation in the related ERBB2 tyrosine kinase (also known as HER2 or Neu), present in a small percentage of NSCLCs, are sensitive to HKI-272, an irreversible dual-specific kinase inhibitor targeting both EGFR and ERBB2. In the ERBB2-mutant NCI-H1781 cell line, HKI-272 treatment inhibited proliferation by induction of G(1) arrest and apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, HKI-272 abrogated autophosphorylation of both ERBB2 and EGFR. Finally, Ba/F3 murine pro-B cells, engineered to express mutant ERBB2, became independent of interleukin-3 and sensitive to HKI-272. Thus, the subset of NSCLC patients with tumors carrying the ERBB2 G776insV_G/C mutation may benefit from treatment with HKI-272.","title":"Non-small-cell lung cancer and Ba/F3 transformed cells harboring the ERBB2 G776insV_G/C mutation are sensitive to the dual-specific epidermal growth factor receptor and ERBB2 inhibitor HKI-272.","pubmedId":"16818618"}
