This syndrome predisposes to various clinical problems such as intussusception and cancer development in different loci (gastrointestinal tract, breast and ovary). For this reason, PJS patients should undergo a surveillance protocol of the genital and gastrointestinal apparatus. Therefore, the early diagnosis of PJS in at-risk family members is very important in preventing cancer development. Germline mutations within the LKB1 or Serine Threonine Kinase (STK11) gene, located on chromosome 19p13.3, are responsible for most cases of PJS so far studied. The existence of a second locus is suspected on chromosome 19q13.4 in a minority of families. The LKB1 gene, recently cloned, encodes the Serine Threonine Kinase LKB1 and is ubiquitously expressed. The identification of the disease-causing mutation in each family makes it possible to perform a presymptomatic diagnosis; therefore, only the mutation carriers will undergo the clinical surveillance program. In this paper, the case of a PJS patient who has been surgically treated is presented. The DNA screening of the LKB1 gene in this patient has led to the identification of the causing mutation. A critical review of the literature and is also presented as well as the proposal to establish an Italian Registry of PJS.","title":"[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: case report and update on diagnosis and treatment].","pubmedId":"11721206"}
