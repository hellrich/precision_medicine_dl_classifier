Human bronchiole epithelial cells and rat type II pneumocytes were found to express p185HER2 at low to undetectable levels by Western blot technique. In contrast, 13 lung cancer cell lines expressed p185HER2, and eight of these 13 expressed p185HER2 at levels at least 2-fold higher than that found in normal bronchiole epithelial cells or type II pneumocytes. Genomic Southern analysis showed that amplification of the HER2 gene was present in only one of the eight cell lines that expressed p185HER2 at these higher levels. Increased levels of steady-state HER2 mRNA occurred in the remaining seven cell lines. We conclude that in human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines the most common mechanism resulting in increased p185HER2 expression is due to mechanisms that increase HER2 mRNA levels, with HER2 gene amplification occurring less commonly.","title":"Mechanisms of p185HER2 expression in human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.","pubmedId":"1312850"}
