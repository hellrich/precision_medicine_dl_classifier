The aim of this study is to investigate the clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of microRNA (miR)-409-3p and its tumor suppressor roles in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD).\nQuantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect miR-409-3p expression in LAD tissues and corresponding noncancerous tissues. Additionally, the correlations of miR-409-3p expression with clinicopathologic factors and prognosis of patients were statistically analyzed. Next, we investigated whether miR-409-3p could function as a tumor suppressor in LAD cells via regulation of Akt signaling by targeting receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Met).\nMiR-409-3p was significantly downregulated in LAD tissues compared with corresponding noncancerous tissues. Low miR-409-3p expression was observed to be significantly correlated with poorer tumor differentiation, advanced pTNM stage and higher incidence of lymph node metastasis. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that miR-409-3p expression was an independent prognostic factor for LAD patients. Functional analyses indicated that miR-409-3p could inhibit growth, induce apoptosis, reduce migration and invasion in LAD cells via inactivation of Akt signaling by targeting c-Met.\nMiR-409-3p was an independent prognostic factor and functioned as a tumor suppressor in LAD via regulation of Akt signaling by targeting c-Met.","title":"MicroRNA-409-3p functions as a tumor suppressor in human lung adenocarcinoma by targeting c-Met.","pubmedId":"25278243"}
