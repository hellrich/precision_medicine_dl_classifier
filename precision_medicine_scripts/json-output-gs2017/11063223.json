Because the tumor expressed CD34 and c-kit gene product, but did not express smooth muscle actin or S-100 protein, it was diagnosed as an uncommitted type of GIST. Moreover, a specific mutation in the sequence coding the juxtamembrane domain in exon 11 of the c-kit proto-oncogene was revealed by a polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism method. One year after resection, the patient developed multiple liver metastases. It is suggested that a specific mutation in exon 11 of the c-kit proto-oncogene may have played an essential role in the development of the liver metastases.","title":"Specific mutation in exon 11 of c-kit proto-oncogene in a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the rectum.","pubmedId":"11063223"}
