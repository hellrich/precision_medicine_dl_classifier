Nevertheless, their recurrence is quite frequent, and identifying the risk factors for recurrent disease is of utmost importance.\nProspective study, patients operated on in the period 2/2008-9/2009. Inclusion criteria for enrolment into the study: age 18-70 years, good health status, and previously untreated solitary intracranial meningioma. Evaluation of clinical, surgical, MRI findings and vascular endothelial growth factor serum levels (prior to procedure, 3 months after, 12 months after, 24 months after procedure and at the time of the last follow-up in 11/2011) was performed. Immunohistochemical analysis of histological samples was carried out. Further treatment (wait and see, redo surgery, treatment with radiation using the Leksell Gamma Knife, external radiotherapy) was recorded in case of a positive follow-up MRI finding (recurrent disease, progression of residual tumour).\nA total of 50 consecutive patients (34 women and 16 men) were included into the study. Average age at the time of surgery was 59.2 years (range 27-75 years). Radical resection with no residual tumour left was achieved in 35 cases. Histological analysis showed grade I meningioma in 45 cases and grade II (atypical) meningioma in 5 cases. Correlation between E-cadherin expression and recurrent meningioma was proved by immunohistochemical examinations; in the remaining investigations, however, such a correlation was not found. No correlation was detected between the serum vascular endothelial growth factor level and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in immunohistochemical investigation. A correlation was found between the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in immunohistochemical investigation and peritumoural oedema. The tumour recurred in 5 cases.\nOn the basis of our results as well as literature findings we can conclude that all the patients after meningioma surgery need to be carefully followed for the rest of their life by repeated MRI invetigations.","title":"[The significance of biological intracranial meningioma behaviour for their long-term management].","pubmedId":"23078225"}
