However, the case of double cancers of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma that are discovered synchronously in different lobes of a liver is very rare. We experienced a case of a 74-year-old man who was found to have hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma in different lobes of the liver, which were accompanied by early gastric cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of double primary hepatic cancers accompanied with early gastric cancer. The pathogenesis and previous related reports of these lesions are discussed.","title":"A case report of synchronous double primary liver cancers combined with early gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"12872450"}
