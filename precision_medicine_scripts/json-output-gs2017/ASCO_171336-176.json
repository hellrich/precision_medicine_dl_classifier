The identification of different molecular drivers utilizing NGS technology has led to better understanding of advanced malignancies. Recently, the prevalence of potentially targetable genomic abnormalities in primary and metastatic breast cancer utilizing NGS method found that 84% of the evaluated cancers harbored at least one genomic alteration linked to potential treatment options. Validation of this NGS testing in 2,221 clinical cases revealed clinically actionable targets in 76% of tumors, corresponding to three times the number of actionable targets detected by other current diagnostic tests. It is for these reasons that the genomic landscape needs to be better characterized Methods: Medical records of all patients referred to the phase 1 clinic at our institution who had NGS performed were reviewed retrospectively from January 2014 to December 2015. Results: 159 cases were identified; 65 males and 94 were females. Mean age was 54.51 Years (Range 25-83 years). Gastrointestinal cancers accounted for 47.2% cases while gynecological, lung and breast cancer accounted for 11%, 10% and 9% respectively. There was an average of 15.31 aberrations per cancer (range: 4- 66). An average of 4.73 aberrations per cancers were found to be clinically relevant, while the rest were variance of unknown significance. FGF, CDK, KRAS, PI3K and FGFR were the most common clinically relevant aberrations and they accounted for 6%, 5.2%, 4.9%, 3.9% and 1.5% of the clinically relevant aberrations respectively. Breast cancer and Colon cancer accounted for 31% and 21% of the PIK3 aberrations. Cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer accounted for 90% (45% each) of FGFR aberrations. Conclusions: In this single institution study for phase 1 trials, we found a small but significant number of patients amenable to targeted therapy. Multi-gene NGS panel testing can identify targetable aberrations such as PIK3 and FGFR genetic aberrations, justifying their use in clinical care for screening patients for early phase clinical trials","title":"Genomic aberrations in advanced solid malignancies using next generation sequencing: A single institution experience.","pubmedId":"ASCO_171336-176"}
