Although different sarcomas have been modeled in mice upon expression of fusion oncogenes in MSCs, sarcomagenesis has not been successfully modeled in human MSCs (hMSCs). We report that FUS-CHOP, a hallmark fusion gene in mixoid liposarcoma (MLS), has an instructive role in lineage commitment, and its expression in hMSC sequentially immortalized/transformed with up to five oncogenic hits (p53 and Rb deficiency, hTERT over-expression, c-myc stabilization, and H-RAS(v12) mutation) drives the formation of serially transplantable MLS. This is the first model of sarcoma based on the expression of a sarcoma-associated fusion protein in hMSC, and allowed us to unravel the differentiation processes and signaling pathways altered in the MLS-initiating cells. This study will contribute to test novel therapeutic approaches and constitutes a proof-of-concept to use hMSCs as target cell for modeling other fusion gene-associated human sarcomas.","title":"Expression of FUS-CHOP fusion protein in immortalized/transformed human mesenchymal stem cells drives mixoid liposarcoma formation.","pubmedId":"23836491"}
