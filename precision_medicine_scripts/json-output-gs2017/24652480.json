Here, we investigated how the PTEN genotype affected the antitumor effect of NVP-BEZ235 in human prostate cancer cells. In this setting, NVP-BEZ235 induced cell death in a PTEN-independent manner. NVP-BEZ235 selectively induced apoptotic cell death in the prostate cancer cell line DU145, which harbors wild-type PTEN; however, in the PC3 cell line, which is PTEN-null, treatment with NVP-BEZ235 resulted in autophagic cell death. Consistently, NVP-BEZ235 treatment did not result in the cleavage of caspase-3; instead, it resulted in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, indicating autophagic cell death; these results suggest that an alternate mechanism of cell death is induced by NVP-BEZ235 in PTEN-null prostate cancer cells. Based on our findings, we conclude that the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway is critical for prostate cancer survival, and targeting PI3K signaling by NVP-BEZ235 may be beneficial in the treatment of prostate cancer, independent of the PTEN genotype.","title":"NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, induces cell death through alternate routes in prostate cancer cells depending on the PTEN genotype.","pubmedId":"24652480"}
