Dot blot hybridization and immunohistochemical methods were performed in 59 Chinese patients. The results showed that Ki-ras PMs at codon 12 and p53 expression were frequent in this group. No relationships were found between Ki-ras PM alone and p53 expression alone, and clinicopathological parameters, including age, gender, clinical stage, and histological grade and classification in Chinese patients. However, their cooperation was significantly associated with a poor prognosis in this group. Comparison showed that there were significant differences in the overall frequency and substitution of Ki-ras PM and in the ratio of transition:transversion in pancreatic cancer among various countries. In addition, the effect of Ki-ras PM and p53 expression on a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer may be different among various countries. These findings suggested that not only Ki-ras PM and p53 expression are frequent in Chinese pancreatic cancer, but also a gene component to pancreatic cancer may be different between Asian and Western pancreatic cancer. In addition, it seems that cooperation of Ki-ras PM and p53 expression may predict a poor prognosis in Chinese patients with pancreatic cancer.","title":"Ki-ras point mutation and p53 expression in human pancreatic cancer: a comparative study among Chinese, Japanese, and Western patients.","pubmedId":"10750666"}
