Protein kinase C epsilon (PKC), a member of the PKC family of phorbol ester/diacylglycerol receptors, has emerged as an oncogenic kinase and shown to be up-regulated in human prostate cancer specimens. We recently demonstrated that PKC is an upstream regulator of NF-B activation in prostate cancer (JBC, 287:37570-37582, 2012) and that transgenic overexpression of PKC in mice prostate under the control of the probasin promoter (PB-PKC) leads to hyperplasia and PIN lesions but was insufficient to drive neoplastic changes (Cell Cycle, 10:268-277, 2011). Notably, when we intercrossed PB-PKC mice with mice haploinsufficient for Pten, another common genetic alteration in human prostate cancer, the resulting compound mutant mice (PB-PKC;Pten+/- mice) developed fully invasive adenocarcinoma with elevated NF-B levels. In the present study, we aim to delineate the mechanism underlying the observed cooperativity between PKC overexpression and Pten deficiency and to explore the consequences of this cooperativity on the transcription factor NF-B signaling, a pathway known to be highly dysregulated in prostate tumorigenesis. To this end, we stably overexpressed PKC in mouse prostate epithelial lines that are either heterozygous (P8) or homozygous (CaP8) for Pten deletion. We observed a striking synergism between PKC overexpression and Pten loss in conferring enhanced proliferative, migratory and invasive phenotype. Moreover, LPS or TNF stimulation of these cells led to increased NF-B activation as evident from the elevated IB phosphorylation, NF-B nuclear translocation and transactivation of a NF-B luciferase reporter. These effects were much more pronounced in CaP8 cells. Of note, PKC overexpression and Pten loss also cooperates to augment levels of the NF-B regulated gene, COX-2. Stable overexpression of PKC and Pten depletion in normal immortalized RWPE1 cells also resulted in significant enhancements in TNF-induced NF-B activation and COX-2 induction. Furthermore, NF-B inhibition by parthenolide significantly retarded the growth of CaP8-PKC tumors in athymic nude mice. Overall, our results identify NF-B as a mediator of PKC oncogenesis in prostate cancer, particularly in the context of Pten loss.","title":"Protein kinase C  cooperates with Pten deficiency to regulate NF-B pathway in prostate cancer progression","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-799"}
