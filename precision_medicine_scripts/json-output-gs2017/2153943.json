The propositus presented with progressive infantile onset of distal amyotrophy of 4 limbs, brisk reflexes, diffuse fasciculations, bulbar signs, and deep sensory loss in both lower limbs. The EMG and nerve biopsy showed typical hypertrophic neuritis. In 4 patients, there were giant axons filled with neurofilaments, with normal conduction velocity. In the youngest boy, the neurologic deficit was less severe, and the nerve biopsy revealed only a few unmyelinated axons filled with neurofilaments. These cases appear to represent a different genetic defect from other reported cases of GAN.","title":"Giant axonal neuropathy with inherited multisystem degeneration in a Tunisian kindred.","pubmedId":"2153943"}
