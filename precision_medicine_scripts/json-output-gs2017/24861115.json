Negative KRAS mutation cases underwent study of BRAF V600E mutation by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and direct sequencing.\nPrimary tumors were located in the colon and rectum in 88 and six cases respectively. Five were liver metastases and in one case, the sample location was undetermined. Forty two samples were KRAS positive (mutated). In 12 of the 58 KRAS negative (wild type) samples, the V600E mutation in codon 15 of the BRAF gene was demonstrated. No differences in the frequency and distribution of mutations, stratified by gender, age, primary tumor versus metastasis, or tumor location were observed.\nTwelve percent of KRAS negative colorectal cancer samples showed BRAF gene mutation. Considering that 42% of samples have a KRAS mutation, 54% of patients should not respond to therapies with monoclonal antibodies directed against epidermic growth factor (EGFR) pathway.","title":"[BRAF gene mutation in wild-type KRAS patients with colorectal cancers].","pubmedId":"24861115"}
