Formation of dimers between HER3 and HER2 seems to be crucial for HER2-driven signals in HER2 overexpressing tumors. Given the fact that HER2-HER3 is considered the most active signalling dimer of the ErbB system, HER3 activity may contribute to the resistance of trastuzumab. PTEN plays a well-established role in the negative regulation of the PI3K pathway. Our aim of this study was to investigate the role of HER3 and PTEN expression in patients with HER2 overexpressed MBC.   Methods:    One-hundred twenty-five MBC patients who were treated with taxane plus trastuzumab chemotherapy as the first line therapy were included in this analysis. Immunohistochemical stainings (IHC) with HER3 and PTEN antibody were conducted retrospectively.   Results:    Median age was 48 years. HER3 IHC was graded from 0 to 3. PTEN IHC was scored as multiplication of intensity and proportion from 0 to 300. The patients who had negative HER3 stain showed better progression free survival (PFS) to taxane plus trastuzumab chemotherapy than those positive HER3 stain (p\u003d0.001, median PFS 21 vs. 11 mo.). The patients who had PTEN score of more than 20 showed longer PFS than those PTEN score of 20 or less than 20 (p\u003d0.006, median PFS 13 vs. 9 mo.). The patients who had PTEN score of more than 20 showed longer overall survival (OS) than those PTEN score of 20 or less than 20 (p\u003d0.005, median OS 48 vs. 25 mo.). HER3 negativity and PTEN loss were identified as independent risk factors for PFS [Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.4 (95% CI 0.3-0.8 for HER3 negativity; HR 2.1 (95% CI 1.2-3.7) for PTEN loss]. However, PTEN loss (HR 3.1 [95% CI 1.6-6.3]) was identified as an independent risk factor for OS.   Conclusions:    HER3 and PTEN expression may be predictive markers for trastuzumab treatment in HER2-positive MBCs. PTEN expression may have a potential predictive and prognostic biomarker for trastuzumab treatment.","title":"Role of HER3 expression and PTEN loss in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients who received taxane plus trastuzumab treatment.","pubmedId":"ASCO_114534-132"}
