She had had diabetes mellitus since she was 30 years old, and insulin therapy was started at 34 years. Laboratory findings were as follows: s-GOT 85, s-GPT 31, gamma-globulin 2.45 g/dl. Immunological tests were positive for anti-smooth muscle antibody and anti-ENA antibody with high titers of antithyroglobulin and anti-microsome antibodies. HLA analysis revealed the presence of DR-4. The thyroid biopsy specimen showed microscopic features characteristic of chronic thyroiditis at 52 years of age. She had been repeatedly admitted for the control of diabetes mellitus. She was admitted for the 9th time in June, 1987 following complaints of abdominal pain. After admission, her general condition became gradually worse, and she died of peritonitis in September, 1987. Pathological examination of the liver revealed an expansion of fibrous tissue on Glisson\u0027s capsule accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration and was diagnosed to be chronic inactive hepatitis. As for the thyroid gland, fibrous tissue replaced an extensive area of the thyroid gland, and normal thyroid tissue was not observed. Lymphocytic infiltration was less in comparison with that in the previous biopsy. As for the pancreas, atrophy of exocrine pancreatic tissue and fibrous change in interstitial tissue was observed. Lymphocytic infiltration was also seen in the interstitial exocrine tissue but not in the islet. Immunohistochemical examination of the islets using anti-insulin, glucagon and somatostatin antibodies by ABC peroxidase method showed the selective disappearance of B cells in the islets. The pathological changes in the thyroid gland, liver and pancreas suggest that autoimmune mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic thyroiditis, chronic hepatitis and IDDM with exocrine pancreatic impairment in this case.","title":"[An autopsied case of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by chronic thyroiditis and chronic hepatitis].","pubmedId":"2591607"}
