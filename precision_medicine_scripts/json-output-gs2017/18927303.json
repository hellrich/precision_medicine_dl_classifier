To allow sensitive detection of EML4-ALK fusion transcripts, we have now developed a multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) system that captures all in-frame fusions between the two genes.\nPrimers were designed to detect all possible in-frame fusions of EML4 to exon 20 of ALK, and a single-tube multiplex RT-PCR assay was done with total RNA from 656 solid tumors of the lung (n \u003d 364) and 10 other organs.\nFrom consecutive lung adenocarcinoma cases (n \u003d 253), we identified 11 specimens (4.35%) positive for fusion transcripts, 9 of which were positive for the previously identified variants 1, 2, and 3. The remaining two specimens harbored novel transcript isoforms in which exon 14 (variant 4) or exon 2 (variant 5) of EML4 was connected to exon 20 of ALK. No fusion transcripts were detected for other types of lung cancer (n \u003d 111) or for tumors from 10 other organs (n \u003d 292). Genomic rearrangements responsible for the fusion events in NSCLC cells were confirmed by genomic PCR analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The novel isoforms of EML4-ALK manifested marked oncogenic activity, and they yielded a pattern of cytoplasmic staining with fine granular foci in immunohistochemical analysis of NSCLC specimens.\nThese data reinforce the importance of accurate diagnosis of EML4-ALK-positive tumors for the optimization of treatment strategies.","title":"Multiplex reverse transcription-PCR screening for EML4-ALK fusion transcripts.","pubmedId":"18927303"}
