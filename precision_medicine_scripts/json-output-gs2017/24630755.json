A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed for the detection of CAEV in blood samples. Species-specific primers amplifying the gag gene region in the provirus were used for the detection of CAEV. The LAMP assay result was obtained 30 min after incubation on a constant temperature at 63 Â°C in a heat block. Resulting amplicons were visualized by addition of SYBR green dye after the reaction and checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. The sensitivity of LAMP assay was evaluated by comparing the result with the nested polymerase chain reaction. Based on the experiments, the result of the assay indicated a rapid and sensitive test for the detection of CAEV.
