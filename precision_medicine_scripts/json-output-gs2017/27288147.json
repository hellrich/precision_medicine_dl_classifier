We analysed the heterogeneous vascular density of human PDAC along with its prognostic correlation.\nTissue Microarrays of 87 patients with different pancreatico-biliary pathologies were analysed in an automated manner (Ariol™) after CD31 staining to assess vascular density in juxta-tumoral and panstromal compartments. In vitro and ex vivo assays were carried out to assess the role of PSC.\nPDAC has a distinct vascular density and distribution of vessels compared to cholangiocarcinoma. The PDAC juxta-tumoral stroma was hypovascular and the normal adjacent rim was hypervascular compared to the panstromal compartment. These features adversely affected patient prognosis, suggesting a model for spatio-temporal PDAC evolution. Mice aortic rings and 3D organotypic cultures demonstrated pro- and anti-angiogenic signalling from activated PSC and cancer cells respectively. ATRA-induced quiescence suppressed the pro-angiogenic activity of PSC.\nHuman PDAC has variable vascularity at microscopic level suggesting that novel stromal directed therapies would need to be determined by pathological characteristics.","title":"Pancreatic stellate cells regulate blood vessel density in the stroma of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27288147"}
