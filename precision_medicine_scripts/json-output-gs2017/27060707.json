Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier (KM) statistics were utilized for survival analysis.\nExcellent inter-rater agreement between EASL/mRECIST (κ \u003d 905) was seen. Correlations between RECIST/mRECIST (κ \u003d 0.638) and EASL/RECIST were weaker (κ \u003d 0.638 and 0.598, respectively). There were significant differences in KM and Cox regression survivals between responders and nonresponders with all three methods (all P \u003c 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified RECIST response, tumor extent, performance status, concomitant chemotherapy, and prior surgery/ablation as independent prognostic factors. EASL response and mRECIST response were not found to be independent prognostic factors.\nImaging biomarkers are not efficient and do not represent ideal surrogates for survival; however, they all display prognostic significance. RECIST is superior to mRECIST/EASL given its ability to stratify survival benefit according to response category and demonstrate independent prognostic significance. J. Surg.
