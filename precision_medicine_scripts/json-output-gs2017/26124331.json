The expression of HSP27 is regulated mainly by heat-shock factor 1, but other transcription factors or kinases have been reported to activate HSP27. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear transcription factor. It has been reported that HMGB1 regulates HSP27 gene expression. Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2) phosphorylates HSP27. In the present study, we investigated the expression of HMGB1 and MAPKAPK2 in KLM1-R cells.\nThe expression levels of HMGB1 and MAPKAPK2 were compared between KLM1 and KLM1-R cells by western blotting.\nThe protein expression of both HMGB1 and MAPKAPK2 were increased in KLM1-R cells compared to KLM1 cells.\nThe increase of both HMGB1 and MAPKAPK2 in KLM1-R cells compared to KLM1 suggest the possibility of the activation of the pathway of HSP27 by HMGB1 and MAPKAPK2 in gemcitabine-resistant KLM1-R cells.","title":"High-mobility Group Box 1 and Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase activated Protein Kinase-2 Are Up-regulated in Gemcitabine-resistant Pancreatic Cancer Cells.","pubmedId":"26124331"}
