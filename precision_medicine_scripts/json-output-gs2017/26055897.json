Kirsten-RAS (KRAS) and EGFR mutations play an important role in the carcinogenesis of a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. Our aim was to investigate the correlation between bone metastases and EGFR and KRAS mutation status in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Retrospectively we analysed 224 patients with recurrent or metastatic lung adenocarcinomas. Patients were treated with standard chemotherapy as first line therapy and with EGFR-TK inhibitors as a second or third line therapy. 72 of 224 patients (32 %) had verified bone metastases. Bone metastases and Skeletal Related Events (SRE) were more frequent in men, heavy smokers and without treatment of EGFR TK inhibitors. We have found that EGFR and KRAS mutation status are both predictive factors for the treatment efficacy and prognostic factors for the disease progression. However there were no significant correlation between mutation status and the presence of bone metastases (P \u003d 0, 59). In our study the presence of bone metastases proved to be an independent prognostic factor related to poor performance status and worse Quality of Life (QL).","title":"Bone Metastases and the EGFR and KRAS Mutation Status in Lung Adenocarcinoma--The Results of Three Year Retrospective Analysis.","pubmedId":"26055897"}
