In this study, an integrated high-resolution survey of regional amplifications and deletions, coupled with gene-expression profiling of non-small-cell lung cancer subtypes, adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC), identified 93 focal copy-number alterations, of which 21 span \u003c0.5 megabases and contain a median of five genes. Whereas all known lung cancer genes/loci are contained in the dataset, most of these recurrent copy-number alterations are previously uncharacterized and include high-amplitude amplifications and homozygous deletions. Notably, despite their distinct histopathological phenotypes, adenocarcinoma and SCC genomic profiles showed a nearly complete overlap, with only one clear SCC-specific amplicon. Among the few genes residing within this amplicon and showing consistent overexpression in SCC is p63, a known regulator of squamous-cell differentiation. Furthermore, intersection with the published pancreatic cancer comparative genomic hybridization dataset yielded, among others, two focal amplicons on 8p12 and 20q11 common to both cancer types. Integrated DNA-RNA analyses identified WHSC1L1 and TPX2 as two candidates likely targeted for amplification in both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer.","title":"High-resolution genomic profiles of human lung cancer.","pubmedId":"15983384"}
