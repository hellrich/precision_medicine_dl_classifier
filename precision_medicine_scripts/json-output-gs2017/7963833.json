Nine hours later, the patient came to use again with a chief complaint of dyspnea and chest oppression. He had extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the upper half of the body. Chest X-ray films revealed remarkable mediastinal emphysema and collapse in a part of right lung. Chest CT scan disclosed enlargement of extrapleural cavity. These findings suggested progression of mediastinal emphysema. Continuous drainage to the extrapleural cavity was performed and the clinical course was uneventful. Thus, a satisfactory result can be obtained by extrapleural drainage in a patient with severe mediastinal emphysema.","title":"[A case of mediastinal emphysema due to blunt trauma that a continuous drainage to the extrapleural space took effect].","pubmedId":"7963833"}
