The majority of patients had stage IV disease (93%), had a history of smoking (98%) and known with an adenocarcinoma (91%). Most common types of KRAS mutation were G12C (46%), G12V (20%) and G12D (10%). Platinum was combined with pemetrexed (n\u003d334), taxanes (n\u003d68) or gemcitabine (n\u003d62). Patients treated with taxanes had a significant improved ORR (50%) compared to pemetrexed (21%) or gemcitabine (25%; p\u003c0.01). Patients treated with bevacizumab in addition to taxanes (n\u003d38) had the highest ORR (62%). The PFS was significantly improved in patients treated with taxanes compared to pemetrexed (HR\u003d0.72, p\u003d0.02), but not OS (HR\u003d0.87, p\u003d0.41). In patients with G12V, significantly improved ORR (p\u003c0.01) was observed for taxanes, but not PFS or OS. Patients with G12C or G12D mutation had comparable ORR, PFS and OS in all treatment groups.\nKRAS mutated NSCLC patients treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had best ORR. Response to chemotherapy regimens was different in types of KRAS mutation. Especially patients with G12V had better response to taxane treatment.","title":"Comparison of clinical outcome after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in different types of KRAS mutated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26415993"}
