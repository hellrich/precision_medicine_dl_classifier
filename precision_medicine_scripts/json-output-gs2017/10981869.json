Given their rarity, the question of primary colon or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma frequently arises when signet ring cell carcinoma is seen in a colonoscopic biopsy or in biopsies procured from other regions of the body. A second related question regarding colon and gastric signet ring cell carcinomas is their immunophenotypic similarities with the glandular form of adenocarcinoma in each site. We studied the immunohistochemical phenotype of 14 colonic signet ring cell adenocarcinomas and compared them with immunophenotype of 27 gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinomas. We also compared the immunophenotype of the 27 gastric signet ring cell with the immunophenotype of 19 gastric gland-forming adenocarcinomas, and the immunophenotype of the 14 colonic signet ring cell adenocarcinomas to the immunophenotype of 20 colonic gland-forming adenocarcinomas to identify staining differences in the neoplastic cells of the two architectures. Antibodies studied were cytokeratins 7, 17, 19, and 20, CA 19-9, CA-125. estrogen receptor, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15. Sixty-four percent of colon signet ring cell adenocarcinomas had either no staining or focal staining with cytokeratin 7 compared with diffuse staining in 63% of gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinomas (P \u003d 0.016). Seventy-two percent of colon signet ring cell adenocarcinomas had diffuse staining with cytokeratin 20 compared with no or focal staining in 50% of gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinomas (P \u003d 0.019). Fifty-seven percent of the colon signet ring cell adenocarcinomas had a cytokeratin 7 (-)/cytokeratin 20 (+) staining pattern compared with 11% of gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinomas (P \u003d 0.004). Forty-four percent of gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinomas had a cytokeratin 7 (+)/cytokeratin 20 (-) pattern, compared with none of the colon signet ring cell adenocarcinomas (P \u003d 0.004). The staining distribution of the antibody battery was similar in colon signet ring cell and colon glandular adenocarcinoma and gastric signet ring cell and gastric glandular adenocarcinomas. When signet ring cell adenocarcinoma is encountered in a colon biopsy, a colon primary is supported if the neoplastic cells have a cytokeratin 7 (-)/cytokeratin 20 (+) staining pattern, and a gastric primary is supported if they have a cytokeratin 7 (+)/cytokeratin 20 (-) staining pattern. The signet ring morphology at each site had an identical immunophenotype as the cells forming their glandular counterpart.","title":"Colon signet ring cell adenocarcinoma: immunohistochemical characterization and comparison with gastric and typical colon adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"10981869"}
