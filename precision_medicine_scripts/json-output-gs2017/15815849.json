The resected tumor was composed of three distinct histological features: well-differentiated liposarcoma with low-grade leiomyosarcomatous and low-grade osteosarcomatous components. To our knowledge, this is the first report of dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the pleura.","title":"Dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the pleura: report of a case.","pubmedId":"15815849"}
