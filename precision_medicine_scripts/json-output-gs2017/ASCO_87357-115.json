Dysregulation of this pathway has been found in a variety of cancer cells. Recently, constitutively active PI3K/Akt signaling has been firmly established as a major determinant for cell growth and survival in an array of cancers. Blocking the constitutively active PI3K/AKT signaling pathway provides a new strategy for targeted cancer therapy. The purpose of our present study was to investigate the expression of activated mTOR (p-mTOR), PTEN, and pAKT in non-neoplastic gastric tissue and in gastric cancer patients to determine their pattern of expression in gastric tumors and their prognostic significance. Methods: The expression of p-mTOR, pAKT, and PTEN was detected in specimens of 239 gastric cancers who underwent radical resection (R0) and in 200 non-neoplastic gastric tissues by immunohistochemistry.  Slides were scanned and analyzed with an automated cellular imaging system (ACIS III, Dako). The correlation of p-mTOR, pAKT, and PTEN expression to clinicopathologic features and survival of gastric cancer was studied. Results: Overexpression of pMTOR in the cytoplasmic pattern, nuclear pAKT, and nuclear PTEN was observed in the non-neoplastic tissues when compared with gastric tumor tissues (all, p\u003c0.001).  Overexpression of pmTOR, pAKT, and PTEN in gastric tumors was closely correlated with pTNM stage (p\u003c0.001, p\u003d0.008, p\u003d0,036, respectively). Patients with p-AKT positive showed significantly longer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates than those with pAKT-negative tumors in univariable analyses.  In multivariable analyses, higher expression rates of pMTOR and losses of PTEN were significantly associated with worse overall survival. Conclusions: Taken together, the observations indicate the PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in the gastric carcinogenesis. A new strategy for combined chemotherapy of gastric cancer should be designed to more specifically block PI3K/Akt pathway for selected patients.","title":"The prognostic implication of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway in gastric carcinomas.","pubmedId":"ASCO_87357-115"}
