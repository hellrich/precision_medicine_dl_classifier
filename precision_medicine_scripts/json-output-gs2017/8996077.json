Patients destined for recurrence can be selected for systemic adjuvant therapy, while patients not likely to recur can be spared the morbidity of unnecessary treatment. The number of tumor-related features available for prognosis has grown impressively in recent years. The purpose of this article is to review tumor-related biologic factors and relate them to prognosis and treatment objectives.","title":"Tumor-related prognostic factors for breast cancer.","pubmedId":"8996077"}
