Data is presented for N(4)-(1-benzyl-1H-indazol-5-yl)-N(6),N(6)-dimethylpyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine-4,6-diamine 3B. This compound inhibited EGFr and c-erbB-2 enzymes selectively over other kinases. It inhibited the proliferation of a range of tumour cell lines in vitro and the growth of BT474 xenografts in SCID mice.","title":"Indazolylamino quinazolines and pyridopyrimidines as inhibitors of the EGFr and C-erbB-2.","pubmedId":"11378364"}
