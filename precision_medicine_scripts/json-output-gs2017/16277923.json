Surgical treatment follows the standard criteria, including removal of as many lymph nodes as possible to ensure correct classification of the disease. For staging, the sentinel node principal may also be advantageous, but this is not yet routine in colon cancer. Patients with Dukes\u0027 C disease routinely receive adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with Dukes\u0027 B disease, chemotherapy is not routine but may be given in selected cases.","title":"[Elective treatment of colon cancer: surgical and oncological].","pubmedId":"16277923"}
