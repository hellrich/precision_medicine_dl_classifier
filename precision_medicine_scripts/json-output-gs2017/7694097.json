It results from the presence of several mutations in one of the genes encoding for arylamine N-acetyltransferase. The polymorphism has been associated with several disease states including colorectal cancer. Several epidemiological studies suggest that rapid acetylators are more susceptible to colorectal cancer than slow acetylators. Moreover, individuals that are both rapid acetylators and exhibit a high cytochrome P450 1A2 activity appear to have an even higher risk of colorectal cancer. These observations not only suggest an interesting genetic link to non-familial colon cancer but also suggest that carcinogens that are activated by N-acetyltransferase and cytochrome P450 1A2 may contribute to the etiology of this disease. Heterocyclic amines present in cooked food such as \"well done\" red meat are carcinogenic in experimental animals forming tumours in several target tissues including the small intestines. We have shown that human polymorphic N-acetyltransferase is present in human colon tissue and that it is capable of activating several heterocyclic amine carcinogens present in cooked food. These studies provide good circumstantial evidence that rapid acetylators may be predisposed to colorectal cancer.","title":"Role of acetylation in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"7694097"}
