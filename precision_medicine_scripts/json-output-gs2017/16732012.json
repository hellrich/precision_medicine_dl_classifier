Retinopathy was assessed by seven-field stereoscopic retinal photography; albumin excretion rate from three consecutive, timed, overnight urine collections; peripheral neuropathy by thermal and vibration threshold; and autonomic neuropathy by pupillometry. HbA(1c) (A1C) and lipids were measured in all patients and C-peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nIn patients with type 1 versus type 2 diabetes, median (interquartile range) age was 15.7 years (13.9-17.0) and 15.3 years (13.6-16.4), respectively (P \u003d 0.2), whereas median diabetes duration was 6.8 years (4.7-9.6) and 1.3 years (0.6-3.1), respectively (P \u003c 0.0001). Retinopathy was significantly more common in patients with type 1 diabetes (20 vs. 4%, P \u003d 0.04), while microalbuminuria and hypertension were significantly less common (6 and 16% in type 1 diabetes vs. 28 and 36% in type 2 diabetes). Rates of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy were similar (27 and 61% in type 1 diabetes vs. 21 and 57% in type 2 diabetes). In multivariate analyses, microalbuminuria was significantly associated with older age (odds ratio 1.3 [95% CI 1.2-1.5], P \u003c 0.001) and systolic hypertension (3.63 [2.0-6.3], P \u003c 0.001) in type 1 diabetes, while only higher A1C (1.7 [1.3-2.9], P \u003d 0.002) was significant in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nYouth with type 2 diabetes have significantly higher rates of microalbuminuria and hypertension than their peers with type 1 diabetes, despite shorter diabetes duration and lower A1C. The results of this study support recommendations for early complications screening and aggressive targeting of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.","title":"Prevalence of diabetes complications in adolescents with type 2 compared with type 1 diabetes.","pubmedId":"16732012"}
