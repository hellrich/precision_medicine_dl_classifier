Resveratrol, a food-derived polyphenol with antitumorigenic properties, can regulate the expression of cytochrome p450 1b1 (Cyp1b1), which may confer chemoresistance in various cancers. Our aims were to assess the effects of resveratrol on the sensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents and show an association between Cyp1b1 expression and chemosensitivity. Cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were treated with resveratrol before the addition of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), gemcitabine, or mitomycin C. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by MTS assays and Annexin staining. Resveratrol effects on cholangiocarcinoma tumor sensitivity to 5-FU was assessed in an in vivo xenograft model using Mz-ChA-1 cells. After resveratrol treatment, Cyp1b1 expression was assessed by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. Stable-transfected cell lines with Cyp1b1 expression knocked down (Mz-Cyp1b1) were used to assess sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents by MTS assays and Annexin staining and in a xenograft model using Mz-ChA-1 and Mz-Cyp1b1 cells, respectively. For each chemotherapeutic agent, co-treatment with resveratrol in vitro decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis to a greater extent than with the chemotherapeutic agent alone. In vivo, 5-FU+resveratrol decreased tumor size and increased TUNEL staining to a greater extent than 5-FU alone. In parallel, resveratrol decreased Cyp1b1 expression in Mz-ChA-1 cells and in cholangiocarcinoma tumors. Mz-Cyp1b1 cells were more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents in vitro than mock-transfected cells, and Mz-Cyp1b1-induced tumors were more susceptible to 5-FU treatment. We suggest that resveratrol treatment may be a useful adjunct therapy to improve chemosensitivity in cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Resveratrol enhances the sensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma to chemotherapeutic agents.","pubmedId":"20458282"}
