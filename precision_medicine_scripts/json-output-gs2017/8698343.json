To assess intrafamilial phenotypic variability, we performed mutation analysis and clinical assessment on two multigeneration NF2 families with five patients and seven asymptomatic first-degree relatives of patients. One family had a point mutation of agCC --\u003e ggCC at position 1447-2 at the exon 13/14 boundary predicted to lead to an altered splice acceptor sequence and exon deletion. The other family had an insertion of 2 base pairs (TC) at position 761 in exon 8, leading to a frameshift. Both mild and severe phenotypes occurred in each family, indicating that phenotypic variability in NF2 can be caused by factors other than NF2 mutations. Genetic counseling of NF2 families should include the possibility that presymptomatic NF2 mutation carriers can develop a different phenotype than previously diagnosed patients.","title":"Phenotypic variability in two families with novel splice-site and frameshift NF2 mutations.","pubmedId":"8698343"}
