There was significant difference among them (P \u003c 0.01); the expression rates of PTEN protein in vocal cord polyp, atypical hyperplasia of vocal cord and glottic carcinoma were 100.00%, 75.00%, 52.38% respectively. There was significant difference among them (P \u003c 0.05), the expressions of Skp2 and PTEN in glottic carcinoma were associated with clinical stage, lymph nodal metastases and prognosis (P \u003c 0.05); there was a negative correlation between the expression of Skp2 and PTEN, and their correlation coefficient was r\u003d -0.4301 (P \u003c 0.01).\nThe expressions of Skp2 and PTEN may play an important roles in the tumorigenesis, metastases and poor prognosis of glottic carcinoma. These changes may be the early molecular event of the carcinogenesis. The high expression of Skp2 was negative correlation with the lower PTEN in glottic carcinoma.","title":"[Expression of Skp2 and PTEN and its correlation in glottic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"18950007"}
