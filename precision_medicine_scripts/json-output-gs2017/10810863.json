The endoscopic detection and rigorous removal of colorectal polyps is an effective means of preventing colorectal carcinoma, since the incidence of the latter can be reduced by 90%. If technically possible, a snare should be used to remove all polyps larger than 5 mm in diameter. Tiny polyps may be removed with forceps. The removed polyp must be send for histological work-up and the results obtained used to plan the further steps or post-polypectomy surveillance. In defined cases (removal with adequate clearance, well-differentiated carcinoma, low risk situation), endoscopic polypectomy of adenomas with invasive carcinoma (pT1 carcinoma) is now the only treatment needed. Further surgical resection is not necessary. Surveillance is as for surgically removed colorectal carcinoma.","title":"[Removing adenomas reduces colon carcinoma risk up to 90%.
