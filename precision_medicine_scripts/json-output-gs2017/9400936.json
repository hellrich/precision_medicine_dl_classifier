LOH at BRCA2 correlated only with low oestrogen and progesterone receptor content. Univariate analysis of metastasis-free survival and overall survival (log-rank test) showed no link with BRCA2 status (P \u003d 0.34, P \u003d 0.29 respectively). LOH at BRCA2 does not therefore appear to be a major prognostic marker in sporadic breast cancer.","title":"Prognostic value of loss of heterozygosity at BRCA2 in human breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"9400936"}
