We report a 55-year-old woman with a history of intraventricular fibroblastic meningioma, who developed headache and tinnitus 5 years after complete resection of the initial tumour. Imaging confirmed a recurrent tumour in the intraventricular location. Histological analysis revealed rhabdoid meningioma. We reviewed the literature and were unable to find any previously reported cases of intraventricular rhabdoid meningioma.","title":"Intraventricular rhabdoid meningioma.","pubmedId":"17433689"}
