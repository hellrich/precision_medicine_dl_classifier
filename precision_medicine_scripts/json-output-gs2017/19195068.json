Cystic neoplasms include mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cystadenomas, papillary cystic tumors, cystic islet cell tumors and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMNs). IPMN was first described in 1982. It has been most commonly described in 60 to 70 years old males, and represents a relatively \"new\" but increasingly recognized disease. The improvement and widespread use of modern imaging equipments and heightened awareness of physicians contribute to the increasing incidence of IPMN. The majority of IPMNs are located in the pancreatic head (75%) while the rest involves the body/tail regions. Multifocal IPMNs have been hypothesized, but the true presence of multifocality is unknown. Here we present a 72-year-old male diagnosed with IPMN (carcinoma in situ) in the pancreatic head and a branch duct type IPMN (duct atypia) in the pancreatic body and tail. The patient underwent a Whipple intervention and a distal pancreatectomy. A three-year disease-free survival has been observed so far.","title":"Multifocal intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas--a case report.","pubmedId":"19195068"}
