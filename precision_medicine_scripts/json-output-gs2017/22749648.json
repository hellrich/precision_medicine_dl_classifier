Exocrine pancreatic secretion was defined as \"moderately reduced\" (faecal elastase-1: 100-200 μg/g), \"severely reduced\" (faecal elastase-1\u003c100 and \u003e20 μg/g) and \"extremely reduced\" (faecal elastase-1≤20 μg/g).\nMedian faecal elastase-1 was 204 μg/g (interquartile range 19; 489). Overall, 48 patients (25%) had an extremely reduced exocrine pancreatic secretion, 28 (14%) a severely reduced exocrine pancreatic secretion and 21 (11%) a moderately reduced exocrine pancreatic secretion. Patients with extremely reduced exocrine pancreatic secretion had higher rates of pancreatic head localizations (P\u003c0.01) and of jaundice (P\u003c0.01). Median overall survival was 10.5 months. Patients with faecal elastase-1≤20 μg/g had a worse prognosis (median survival: 7 versus 11 months, P\u003d0.031). Presence of metastases (Hazard ratio 1.81, P\u003c0.0001), haemoglobin ≤12 g/L (Hazard ratio 2.12, P\u003d0.001), albumin ≤40 g/L (Hazard ratio 1.64, P\u003d0.010) and FE-1≤20 μg/g (Hazard ratio 1.59 P\u003d0.023) resulted as independent predictors of survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients.\nA low value of faecal elastase-1 is strongly correlated with a poor survival in advanced pancreatic cancer.","title":"Faecal elastase-1 is an independent predictor of survival in advanced pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"22749648"}
