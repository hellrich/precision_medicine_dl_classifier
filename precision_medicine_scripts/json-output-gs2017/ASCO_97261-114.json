The most frequent histologic type of them is adenocarcinoma, however little is known about the pathological and molecular characteristics of younger patients with lung adenocarcinoma.  Methods:  Between July 1992 and April 2011, a total of 7443 patients were diagnosed as lung cancer in National Cancer Center Hospital East and 165 patients of whom (2.2%) who were 40 years or younger were identified. Among them, 44 patients with adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection were selected for this study. In addition, 185 elderly patients with \u003e 40 years who underwent surgical resection matching gender and smoking status were selected as a control group. Histological predominant growth pattern and any coexisting variant pattern, the status of EGFR mutations were compared between these two groups.  Results:  The median age in  40 years patients was 37 years (range, 21 to 40 years) and that in elderly patients was 68 years (range, 42 to 83 years). Between these two groups, there were no significant differences in the distribution of histological predominant growth patterns (lepidic; 31.8% vs. 26.5%, papillary; 34.1% vs. 37.3%, acinar; 9.1% vs. 16.2%, and solid; 25.0% vs. 20.0%, p\u003d0.78) and the incidence of EGFR mutations (40.9% vs. 45.9%; p\u003d0.55). However, signet-ring cell component were significantly found in the younger patients than elderly (11.4% vs. 0%; p\u003c0.01). The incidence of EGFR exon 19 deletion was significantly higher in younger patients than elderly, in contrast, that of EGFR exon 21 L858R was significantly higher in elderly patients (exon 19 del; 31.7% vs. 18.9%, L858R; 4.6% vs. 25.4%, p\u003d0.0091). Three of 17 adenocarcinomas (17.7%) with EGFR-wild type in younger patients showed positive for ALK translocation.  Conclusions:  Younger patients with lung adenocarcinoma showed significantly higher proportion of EGFR exon 19 deletion genotype and containing histologically signet-ring cell component comparing with elderly patients. EGFR exon 19 deletion genotype may be related to pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma in younger patients.","title":"Higher incidence of EGFR exon 19 deletion in younger (age 40 or younger) patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"ASCO_97261-114"}
