Here, we report a patient with ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma who was administered crizotinib via nasogastric and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes, with positive results. This case indicates that patients with ALK-positive NSCLC may successfully be treated with crizotinib via nasogastric or PEG tubes. This approach can even be used as a salvage treatment in patients with poor prognoses.","title":"Crizotinib administered via nasogastric and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes for the successful treatment of ALK-rearranged lung cancer in a patient with poor performance status.","pubmedId":"23561259"}
