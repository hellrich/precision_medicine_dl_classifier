After resection of stage IA non-small cell lung cancer, survival at 5 years is approximately 60% to 70%. If endoscopic or bronchoscopic treatments of early-stage lung cancer can provide similar disease-free survival with less perioperative mortality, morbidity, and cost, then they may be alternative front-line therapies.\nThe authors review early-stage lung cancer detection by fluorescence bronchoscopy and the potential treatment of this disease by endoscopic techniques (photodynamic therapy, brachytherapy, Nd:YAG laser, electrocautery, and cryotherapy).\nSeveral reports have noted improved outcomes using endoscopic therapies for early-stage lung cancer, but insufficient data preclude firm conclusions regarding the role of fluorescence bronchoscopy, endobronchial brachytherapy, or electrocautery in early-stage lung cancer. Other than resection, photodynamic therapy may represent the best approach at this time. The principal indication for laser bronchoscopy is palliation of central airway obstruction.\nThe identification of early-stage lung cancer provides no advantage if we have little to offer the patient short of traditional therapy. The value of newer treatment techniques and methods requires verification.","title":"Endoscopic treatment of early-stage lung cancer.","pubmedId":"10740659"}
