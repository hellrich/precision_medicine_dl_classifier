Vascular endothelial growth factor 1/Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (VEGFR1/Flt-1) regulates monocyte migration, recruits endothelial cell progenitors, increases the adhesive properties of natural killer cells and induces of growth factors. Flt-1 is expressed on tumour cells and has been implicated in tumour growth and progression. The objective of this study is to address the relation of Flt-1 expression to tumour prognostication. Paraffin blocks from 143 primary CRC and 48 regional nodal metastases were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Pathology at King Abdulaziz University. Tissue microarrays were designed and constructed. Immunohistochemistry for Flt-1 was performed. Staining intensity and extent of staining were assessed and combined. Results were dichotomised as low expression and high expression. Flt-1 was overexpressed in primary tumours and nodal metastasis (p \u003c 0.001 and 0.001) with no difference between primary and nodal metastasis (p \u003d 0.690). Flt-1 immunoexpression was not associated with the clinicopathological parameters. Flt-1 overexpression was an independent predictor of positive margin status, positive lymphovascular invasion and local disease recurrence (p \u003c 0.001, p \u003c 0.001 and p \u003d 0.003, respectively). Flt-1 was not associated with survival (log-rank \u003d 0.003, p \u003d 0.959). Flt-1 was overexpressed in primary CRC and their nodal metastases. Flt-1 expression was an independent predictor of margin status, lymphovascular invasion and local disease recurrence. Therefore, expression profiling of Flt-1 seems to have a prognostic potential in CRC. However, to elucidate the association of overexpression of Flt-1 with tumour characteristics and prognostication, more in vivo and in vitro molecular investigations are recommended.","title":"Prognostic significance of VEGFR1/Flt-1 immunoexpression in colorectal carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24908415"}
