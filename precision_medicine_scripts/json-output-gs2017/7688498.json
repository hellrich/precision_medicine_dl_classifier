Thus, malignant melanoma of stage II and the more advanced stages. At present, chemotherapeutic combinations used as the first choice in Japan are two regimens of postoperative adjuvant therapy for stage II and III patients, that aim at preventing recurrence. One of the regimens is a DAV combination (Dacarbazine, ACNU, vincristine), and another is PAV combination (Pepleomycin, ACNU, vincristine). For stage IV patients, the major therapeutic procedure is a CDV combination (cisplatin, dacarbazine, vindesine). The efficacy of CDV treatment has been approximately 30 per cent in our studies. It has shown comparable effects for metastatic lesion in the lymph nodes, mucous membrane (nasal cavity) and brain, while lesions in other organs are largely unaffected in many instances. Studies of new drugs and combinations must be undertaken for the treatment of malignant melanoma.","title":"[Chemotherapy of malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"7688498"}
