The current methods of treating pancreatic carcinoma are far from satisfactory. The results of systemic and regional chemotherapies for pancreatic carcinoma are disappointing. The patient was a 68-year-old male with advanced pancreatic carcinoma. After an operation, he received a combination therapy consisting of arterial infusion (gemcitabine hydrochloride, GEM, 600 mg) and muscle injection of interferon (IFN, 300x10(4) U). A decrease in metastatic tumor of the liver was observed. In this report, we describe the case of a patient whose effective results were achieved by using a new combination of GEM and IFN.","title":"[The QOL of the patient with advanced pancreatic carcinoma was changed for the better with combination therapy consisting of arterial chemotherapy and injection of interferon].","pubmedId":"15553730"}
