However, the preoperative diagnosis of malignancy is extremely difficult in IPMT. IPMT with a main pancreatic duct of less than 7 mm, or cystic lesion of less than 30 mm (branched type), or intramural nodule tumor of less than 4 mm, should be observed without performing surgery and followed carefully. The strategy for surgical treatment of IPMT is very important. Which procedure should be selected or performed? A radical operation should be performed with lymph node dissection if a preoperative diagnosis of malignancy is made. If cancer cannot be ruled out in an IPMT, a function-preserving procedure, such as pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, pancreatic head resection with second-portion duodenectomy, segmental resection, partial resection, or spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy should be selected, and one of these procedures should be carried out with group I lymph node dissection. The greatest challenge in IPMT is making the diagnosis of benign or malignant and selecting the most appropriate treatment.","title":"[Strategy for surgical treatment of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors].","pubmedId":"12854492"}
