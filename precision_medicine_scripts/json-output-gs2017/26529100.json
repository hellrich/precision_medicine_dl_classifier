Agents blocking the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also called HER1 and ERBB1) and the co-receptor called HER2/ERBB2 have been approved over the last decade as anti-cancer drugs. Because the catalytically defective member of the family, HER3/ERBB3, plays critical roles in emergence of resistance of carcinomas to various drugs, current efforts focus on antibodies and other anti-HER3/ERBB3 agents, which we review herein with an emphasis on drug combinations and some unique biochemical features of HER3/ERBB3.
