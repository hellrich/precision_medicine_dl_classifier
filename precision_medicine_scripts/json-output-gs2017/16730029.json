However, its part in the mucosal defense of the inflamed stomach remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of various NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors on gastric ulcerogenic and acid secretory responses following daily exposure of the stomach to iodoacetamide and investigated the role of each NOS isozyme in gastric protection from subchronic mucosal irritation. Gastric mucosal irritation was induced in rats by addition of 0.1% iodoacetamide to drinking water, and the gastric mucosa was examined on the 6th day. L-NAME (a nonselective NOS inhibitor: 20 mg/kg) or aminoguanidine (a selective iNOS inhibitor: 20 mg/kg) was given s.c. twice 24 h and 3 h before the termination of iodoacetamide treatment. Giving iodoacetamide in drinking water for 5 days produced minimal damage in the stomach with an increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and lipid peroxidation. Iodoacetamide treatment up-regulated the expression of iNOS mRNA and NO production in the stomach, without affecting nNOS expression. Both L-NAME and aminoguanidine markedly aggravated gastric lesions induced by iodoacetamide treatment, with a further enhancement in MPO activity and lipid peroxidation. Basal acid secretion as determined in pylorous-ligated stomachs was decreased following iodoacetamide treatment, but the response was significantly restored by both L-NAME and aminoguanidine. These results suggest that endogenous NO derived from both cNOS and iNOS is involved in mucosal defense of the inflamed stomach, partly by decreasing acid secretion, and contributes to maintaining mucosal integrity under such conditions.","title":"Role of endogenous nitric oxide in mucosal defense of inflamed rat stomach following iodoacetamide treatment.","pubmedId":"16730029"}
