Cystinuria is an inherited disease that consists of congenital abnormalities of renal and intestinal transport of dibasic amino acids. It often leads to frequent recurrent stone formation. Cystine stones most frequently occur in the 1st through 3rd decades of life with a decreased incidence in old age. This case shows that the first diagnosis of cystinuria may be made even in the 8th decade, without any family history, and in a patient with a history of recurrent calcium stone disease. Therefore, the chance of cystinuria must be always considered, even in older calcium stone formers.","title":"Staghorn cystine stone in a 72-year-old recurrent calcium stone former.","pubmedId":"22732341"}
