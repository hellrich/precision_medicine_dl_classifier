PDA is the 3rd leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Kras mutations (e.g. KrasG12D) are associated with over 90% of human PDA and are an early event in the multistep process leading to PDA. Kras can be activated by protein kinase and G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) signaling. Rgs proteins regulate GPCR signaling by accelerating the GTPase activity of Gq- and Gi class alpha subunits. Activating alleles of Gq that are resistant to Rgs inhibition are associated with PDA in humans. We found Rgs8 and Rgs16 are in vivo reporters of Kras activity in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), and PDA progression (DMM 8, 2015). Rgs8 and Rgs16 are expressed in PanIN and IPMN, precursors of PDA, in KC mice (LSL-KrasG12D; p48::Cre). To test if Rgs8-16 function as tumor suppressor genes, we crossed the Rgs8-16 double knockout into KC (termed KCR8-16) mice. Compared to KC, PDA initiates earlier, is more aggressive, and KCR8-16 mice die earlier. Our study suggests that Rgs8 and Rgs16 control Kras-dependent PDA initiation and progression.","title":"Rgs8 and Rgs16 are tumor suppressor genes in mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-5518"}
