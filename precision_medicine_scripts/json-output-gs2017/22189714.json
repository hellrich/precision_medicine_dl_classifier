The KRAS-variant is associated with increased risk of various cancers, including lung cancer, ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, and is associated with altered tumor biology in head and neck cancer, colon cancer and melanoma. To better understand the molecular pathways that may be regulated or affected by the presence of the KRAS-variant allele in cancer cells, we examined its prevalence in the NCI-60 panel of cell lines and sought to identify common features of the cell lines that carry the variant allele. This study provides a step forward towards understanding the molecular and pathological significance of the KRAS-variant.","title":"KRAS alleles: the LCS6 3\u0027UTR variant and KRAS coding sequence mutations in the NCI-60 panel.","pubmedId":"22189714"}
