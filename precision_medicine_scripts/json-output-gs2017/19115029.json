Using pancreatic cancer as a model, we discuss herein the fundamentals that need to be considered for the high throughput and global identification of mutations. These include patient-related issues, sample collection, DNA isolation, gene selection, primer design, and sequencing techniques. We also describe the possible applications of the discovery of DNA changes to the approach of this disease and cite preliminary efforts where the knowledge has been translated into the clinical or preclinical setting.","title":"Basic principles and technologies for deciphering the genetic map of cancer.","pubmedId":"19115029"}
