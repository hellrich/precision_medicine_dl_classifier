The clinical histories of the patients from whom the cell lines were derived are reported. The lines were maintained in continuous culture with doubling times of 65 (RAL) and 50 (CAEP) hours. The RAL and CAEP cell lines, whose morphology and ultrastructural features are presented, showed extensively rearranged karyotypes with modal number of 85 (RAL) and 98 (CAEP). In particular, chromosome 2 pentasomy and several clonal markers were evident in the RAL cells, whereas a telomeric deletion of chromosome 1, del (1)(q32), was observed in the CAEP cells. The morphologic data were confirmed by high expression of specific antigens for each histotype. A marked positivity of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels was evident by immunoenzymatic assays in the cell lines cytosol with respect to those present in the respective patient\u0027s sera. No amplification or rearrangements were evident in the CMYC, LMYC, NMYC, INT-2, ERBB2, HRAS, KRAS, MOS, HST-1 genes by Southern blotting analysis in each cell line. Point mutations in exon 1 of KRAS and in exon 7 of TP53 were evident by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DNA sequencing in the RAL cell line, whereas no alterations were present in the HRAS and RB genes. The four genes studied did not show point mutations in the CAEP cell line. The RAL cell line was resistant to all the drugs tested, whereas the CAEP cells were sensitive to vinblastine. These cell lines may represent useful experimental models to investigate lung cancer biology and anticancer drug response.","title":"Molecular and biological features of two new human squamous and adenocarcinoma of the lung cell lines.","pubmedId":"9809028"}
