In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of Sp1 and COX2 in 88 PDAC patients. Our study showed there was a positive correlation between Sp1 and COX2 expression (P\u003d0.001) by using the Spearman\u0027s rank test. Pearson Chi-square test revealed that Sp1 and COX2 expression were positively associated with lymph node metastasis (P\u003c0.05, both). In addition, the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with Sp1- or COX2-positive expression exhibited poorer overall survival (OS) than those with Sp1- or COX2-negative expression (P\u003c0.05, all). Most importantly, Sp1- and COX2-negative patients had the best OS (P\u003d0.01). In multivariate analysis, Sp1 expression (P\u003d0.03), COX2 expression (P\u003d0.04), and nuclear grade (P\u003d0.009) were found to be independent predictors for OS. Moreover, we confirmed that Sp1 could upregulate the expression of COX2 in PDAC cell lines by western blot analysis, and both are of important prognostic value in PDAC.
