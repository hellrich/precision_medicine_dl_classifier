LKB1 functions as a key upstream activator of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central metabolic switch found in all eukaryotes that govern glucose and lipid metabolism and autophagy in response to alterations in nutrients and intracellular energy levels. The LKB1/AMPK signalling pathway suppresses mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), an essential regulator of cell growth in all eukaryotes that is deregulated in a majority of human cancers. LKB1 inactivation in cancer leads to both tumorigenesis and metabolic deregulation through the AMPK and mTORC1-signalling axis and there remain critical challenges to elucidate the direct role LKB1 inactivation plays in driving aberrant metabolism and tumour growth. This review addresses past and current efforts to delineate the molecular mechanisms fueling metabolic deregulation and tumorigenesis following LKB1 inactivation as well as translational promise of therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting LKB1-deficient tumors.
