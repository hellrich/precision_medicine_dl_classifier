Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is highly expressed in colorectal cancer and its expression correlates with malignant transformation. In this study, we performed a microarray analysis with the RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) method and identified hnRNP A1-interacting miRs, including miR-26a and -584, in a colorectal cancer cell line, SW620. A SRB assay revealed the tumor suppressive effect of miR-26a and -584, and the tumor suppressive effect of these miRs was diminished by the downregulation of hnRNP A1. The combined method of a transcriptome analysis and RNA-IP revealed hnRNP A1-interacting mRNAs, including cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). A Western blot analysis revealed the downregulation of CDK6 in miR-26a and -584 overexpression cells, as well as hnRNP A1 knockdown cells. The binding assay indicated that the binding of hnRNP A1-CDK6 mRNA was reduced by transfection of miR-26a and -584. The expression of cleaved caspase-3 was induced in miR-26a and -584 overexpression cells. These data indicate that miR-26a and -584 inhibit the binding of hnRNP A1-CDK6 mRNA and induce colorectal cancer cell apoptosis.
