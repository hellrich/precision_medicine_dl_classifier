One sequence alteration was 859/G\u003eA in exon 7 (V211I). The other second sequence alteration (IVS13-2A\u003eT) affected the splicing site in intron 13. The latter alteration is not yet listed in the Breast Cancer Information Core database. RT-PCR resulted in transcription of a sequence lacking exon 7 and a subsequent anomalous stop codon in exon 9 thereby confirming altered messenger RNA (mRNA) maturation. Amplification of the mutation in intron 13 resulted in transcription of a sequence lacking exon 14 and an anomalous stop codon in exon 15 thereby confirming altered mRNA maturation. Both mutations led to a truncated BRCA2 protein in its carboxy-terminal region.\nThe two BRCA2 mutations identified affect mRNA splicing fidelity and play a pathogenetic role in breast and ovarian cancer.","title":"Two mutations of BRCA2 gene at exon and splicing site in a woman who underwent oncogenetic counseling.","pubmedId":"19179552"}
