However, little is known about how cancers develop acquired resistance to this class of EGFR inhibitors. We sought to identify and study EGFR mutations that confer resistance to this class of agents.\nWe performed an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen in EGFR-mutant (sensitizing alone or with concurrent EGFR T790M) Ba/F3 cells and selected drug-resistant clones. We evaluated the sensitivity of EGFR inhibitors in models harboring drug-resistant EGFR mutations.\nWe identified 3 major drug resistance mutations. EGFR L718Q, L844V, and C797S cause resistance to both WZ4002 and CO-1686 while, in contrast, only EGFR C797S leads to AZD9291 resistance. Cells containing an EGFR-sensitizing mutation, Del 19 or L858R, in conjunction with L718Q, L844V, or C797S retain sensitivity to quinazoline-based EGFR inhibitors, gefitinib and afatinib. The C797S mutation, in the presence of Del 19 or L858R and T790M, causes resistance to all current EGFR inhibitors, but L858R/T790M/C797S remains partially sensitive to cetuximab which leads to disruption of EGFR dimerization.\nOur findings provide insights into resistance mechanisms to irreversible pyrimidine-based EGFR inhibitors and identify specific genomic contexts in which sensitivity is retained to existing clinical EGFR inhibitors. These findings will guide the development of new strategies to inhibit EGFR.","title":"EGFR Mutations and Resistance to Irreversible Pyrimidine-Based EGFR Inhibitors.","pubmedId":"25948633"}
