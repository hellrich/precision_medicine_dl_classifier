Cytological confirmation of malignancy by fluid analysis and fine-needle, ultrasound-guided aspiration of the liver was followed by histological examination of tissue samples obtained at surgery and necropsy. No observed response followed chemotherapy with doxorubicin and carboplatin. Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry helped to further characterize this unusual tumor.","title":"Mucinous cholangiocarcinoma in a cat.","pubmedId":"17473024"}
