The subjects were assigned to 4 groups; group A (n \u003d 8) was only treated by hepatectomy, group B (n \u003d 27) by intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with hepatectomy, group C (n \u003d 42) with intra-arterial chemotherapy alone, and group D (n \u003d 23) by systemic chemotherapy through intra-venous or oral administration. The survival rates of these groups were determined, and the recurrence risk after hepatectomy was compared between group A and B. Further, the survival rate of the patients treated by intra-arterial chemotherapy was compared between the cases of PD and not-PD (including CR, PR, and NC). The median survival in cases of H1 and H2 was 405 days for group A, 1,018 days for group B and 245 days for group C, showing that group B had a significantly more favorable prognosis than either group A or group C. There were also significant differences in the median survival of H3 cases between group C (422 days) and group D (113 days). One-year cumulative recurrence risks in the residual livers of group A and group B were 79% and 28%, respectively. Thus, significant differences in the recurrence risk were found in the two groups. Meanwhile, the median survival of PD and non-PD cases was 240 and 588 days, respectively. These results suggested that local control by intra-arterial chemotherapy is useful for life prolongation.","title":"[Efficacy of intra-arterial chemotherapy on life prolongation in patients with hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"10560383"}
