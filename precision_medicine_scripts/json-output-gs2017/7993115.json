The dose level of VP-16 was fixed at 100 mg/m2, while the dosages of CDDP and CBDCA administered at each of the 4 steps were 50/200, 60/200, 60/250 and 70/250 mg/m2, respectively. Nine patients were allocated to each step dose group. Toxicities were evaluated in the first 2 courses to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). As a result, step 3 dosages proved to be MTD, and the dose limiting factor (DLF) was hematotoxicity, but gastro-intestinal toxicity was tolerated. The response (CR+PR) was found in 21 out of 23 patients with evaluable lesions (91%). In the 22 patients who had not received pretreatment, median survival time (M ST) was 16.4 months. These results suggest that the recommended dose is step 2, and that the CPVP regimen is both more tolerable and more effective than the standard regimen. The CPVP regimen warrants further study in phase III trials.","title":"[Phase I/II study of a combination regimen composed of cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide against small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"7993115"}
