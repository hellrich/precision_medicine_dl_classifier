This study was to invest the prevalence of BRCA1 gene mutation in breast cancer patients in Guangxi, China, and to try reflecting its relevance in genetic counseling of breast cancer.\nIn this study, 463 breast cancer patients and 30 healthy women (control group) were involved. Entire sequence and splicing sites of BRCA1 genes were detected by PCR-DNA sequencing.\nAbout 8.9% (41/463) patients were with 22 BRCA1 mutations (all in exon 10). The average hospitalized age of BRCA1-associated breast cancer cases was significantly younger (t \u003d -2.965, P \u003d 0.003). The nuclear grade (U \u003d 2321.0, P \u003d 0.030), ER (U \u003d 4343.5, P \u003d 0.041) and CerbB-2 (U \u003d 3894.0, P \u003d 0.038) expression levels, and triple negative breast cancer diagnosing rate (Ï‡(2) \u003d 4.719, P \u003d 0.03) were disclosed more in BRCA1-associated patients.\nThe four most frequent BRCA1 mutation (2798 T \u003e C, 3971 G \u003e A, 3971 G \u003e A and 624 C \u003e T) found in female breast cancer cases in Guangxi are all located in exon 10. BRCA1-associated breast cancer cases have earlier onset age, higher nuclear grade and negative ER and CerbB-2 expression.","title":"Prevalence of BRCA1 gene mutation in breast cancer patients in Guangxi, China.","pubmedId":"25337278"}
