This overview of clinical studies describes the effects of administering the targeted agents bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab, also known as monoclonal antibodies, to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. All three targeted agents have been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. Bevacizumab has been shown to extend survival when used in combination with irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, and the addition of cetuximab to irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy overcomes irinotecan resistance. Cetuximab and panitumumab are both efficacious among refractory mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS tumors. Other targeted agents, for example, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib, gefitinib, sunitinib, and vatalanib (PTK787/ZK 222584), are currently in various stages of clinical development.","title":"Chemotherapy with targeted agents for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"19411318"}
