Protein expression of Runx3 was measured by immunohistochemistry.\nThe frequency of promoter methylation of Runx3 gene in gastric cancer tissue(55.0%) was significantly higher compared to the adjacent normal tissues (12.5%)(P\u003c0.01). The positive rate of protein expression of Runx3 in gastric cancer tissue(37.5%) was significantly lower compared to the adjacent normal tissues (100%). There was marked association between hypermethylation and negative protein expression (P\u003c0.05). The frequency of Runx3 promoter methylation was associated with histological type, N grade, and tumor stage.\nThe promoter hypermethylation is a main mechanism of reduced or loss expression of Runx3 gene, which may provide molecular diagnosis and stage evaluation of gastric cancer.","title":"[Promoter methylation and expression of Runx3 gene in gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"18636364"}
