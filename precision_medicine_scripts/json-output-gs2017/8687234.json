Mutations of the K-ras gene, amplification or overexpression of myc family genes, erbB2 gene, or bcl2 gene are frequent genetic changes of oncogenes in lung cancer. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as Rb gene, p53 gene, or p16 gene are also seen rather frequently. Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity at certain chromosomal arms such as 3p, 5q, 18q and 22q suggesting inactivation of yet unidentified tumor suppressor genes, also occurs in a significant proportion of lung cancers. Most of these genetic lesions have been reported to be associated with a poor prognostic outcome of the patients. However, great controversy exists as to whether a certain genetic lesion is really a prognostic marker. For example, although about 20 studies have been published, the prognostic implications of the p53 gene for patients with lung cancer still remain unclear. Little is known about the mechanism through which a certain genetic change affects the patient\u0027s prognosis. To ultimately improve the prognosis of patients with this deadly disease, definitive studies on which subsequent clinical trials can rely are much awaited.","title":"[Genetic abnormalities in lung cancer and their prognostic implications].","pubmedId":"8687234"}
