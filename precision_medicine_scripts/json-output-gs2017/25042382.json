The most common histological subtypes include invasive carcinoma \"of no special type\" and papillary carcinoma. Other variants, including pure micropapillary carcinoma, have been described as well but are extremely rare. Pure micropapillary carcinoma has been recently characterized by a C-MYC gene amplification in women. We report here, occurring in a 73-year-old man, the first case of pure micropapillary carcinoma with amplification of the C-MYC gene.
