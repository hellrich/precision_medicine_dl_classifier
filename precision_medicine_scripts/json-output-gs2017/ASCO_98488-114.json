We therefore performed a systematic screen for tyrosine kinase (TK) fusions in cases without known driver oncogenes by measuring aberrantly high RNA expression of kinase domain (KD) exons relative to more 5 exons.  Methods:  We studied 74 patients whose lung ADC lacked mutations in KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, HER2, and ALK fusions. A NanoString-based assay was designed to query the transcripts of 90 TKs at two points: 5 to the KD and within or 3 to the KD. Tumor RNAs were hybridized to the NanoString probes and analyzed for outlier 3 to 5 expression ratios. The assay was validated on samples with known ALK and ROS fusions. Presumed novel fusion events were followed up by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and confirmatory RT-PCR.  Results:  The NanoString assay identified aberrant 5 to 3 ratios in ROS and RET in 2 cases, respectively, out of 74. RACE analysis isolated a novel GOPC-ROS fusion in the former and a novel KIF5B-RET fusion in the latter, both confirmed by RT-PCR. Further screening by RT-PCR for KIF5B-RET identified one more positive sample in the study set that had not been detected by NanoString.  At the RNA level, both fusions joined exon 15 of KIF5B to exon 12 of RET, thus retaining a portion of the dimerization domain of KIF5B and the entire KD of RET, analogous to RET fusions in papillary thyroid carcinoma (TC). One KIF5B-RET patient was a 60 y.o. female never smoker, the other, a 73 y.o. male former smoker.  Conclusions:  The novel KIF5B-RET fusion described here and also recently reported by Ju YS et al. (Genome Res, Dec 22, 2011) defines a new subset of lung ADC with a potentially targetable driver oncogene. Based on these genetic data and the preclinical activity of the RET inhibitor XL184 (Exelixis) in papillary TC and its known activity in medullary TC with RET mutations, we have initiated prospective testing for KIF5B-RET as part of our lung ADC screening panel in anticipation of a planned phase 2 trial with XL184 in patients with KIF5B-RET or related variant RET fusions.","title":"KIF5B-RET: Discovery of a novel fusion oncogene in lung adenocarcinomas by a systematic screen for tyrosine kinase fusions and identification of patients for a RET targeted therapy trial.","pubmedId":"ASCO_98488-114"}
