The aim of this translational study is to evaluate the correlation of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), E-cadherin(CDH1), B-catenine, osteopontin (OPN) expression and PIK3CA, KRAS/BRAF mutations with pathological disease stage, relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in pts recruited in the ITACA-S  trial. The choice of these factors derived from the strong correlation of all the markers with H. Pylori infection.  Methods:  From 23 ITACA-S study recruiting centers, we collected  346 primary GC samples of pts radically resected for GC stratified by treatment arms and by the presence/absence of disease relapse. Multivariable analyses of RFS and OS were performed using Cox models.  Results:   Among the immunoistochemichal markers, OPN and E-cadherin expression was significantly associated with RFS and OS (p \u003c0.001; 0.017and p \u003d 0.003 and 0.001 respectively). The expression of -catenin showed a trend for association with RFS and a significant correlation with OS (p \u003d 0.054; 0.009). At multivariable Cox model analysis, only OPN was independently associated  with outcome. COX-2 not significantly associated with RFS and OS; conversely no mutation of PIK3CA, KRAS and BRAF  were observed. HP positivity were  documented in  28% of  samples.  Conclusions:   The results suggest that OPN overexpression is an independent prognostic factor for RFS and OS in radically resected GC. The  lack PI3K KRAS and BRAF mutation exclude any strong correlation with HP infection.
