In parallel, p53 protein accumulation was determined by means of immunohistochemistry. The percentage of mutations was found to be higher than previously reported (6 of 44 grade II oligodendrogliomas, 4 of 19 grade III oligodendrogliomas, 4 of 15 glioblastomas). In 4 cases, the mutations lead to distinct changes in the primary or secondary structure of the protein (cysteine--\u003etyrosine, proline--\u003eleucine) and were associated with marked accumulation of p53 protein. A significant correlation between p53 protein accumulation and TP53 gene aberrations was found (P \u003c 0.001), although p53 protein accumulation was detected more often than TP53 gene anomalies, indicating that factors other than TP53 gene mutation may also lead to a p53 protein accumulation in the tumour cells. A significant correlation was found for p53 protein accumulation and tumour grade but not TP53 gene mutations. In conclusion, evaluation of p53 protein accumulation reflected the clinical course of oligodendrogliomas better than the mere presence of TP53 gene mutations.","title":"Demonstration of p53 protein and TP53 gene mutations in oligodendrogliomas.","pubmedId":"9038605"}
