Thirteen patients with a negative surface biopsy for malignancy underwent a repeat ampullary biopsy following needle knife papillotomy. There were 8 (61.5%) males and 5 (38.5%) females. The most common presenting symptom was jaundice (100%), followed by fever (46.2%), melena (38.5%), abdominal pain (30.8%) and weight loss (30.8%). All the patients had hyperbilirubinemia with a mean ± SD serum bilirubin of (11.2 ± 1.9) mg/dL (normal value \u003c 1 mg%) and the mean ± SD serum alkaline phosphatase was (288.0 ± 94.3) IU/L (normal value \u003c 129 IU/L). Serum CA 19.9 level estimation was done in 11 patients; it was elevated (cut off value \u003e 70.5 IU/L) in all of them with a median of 1200 IU/L (inter quartile range 274-3500). Side viewing endoscopy showed a bulky papilla in all of them. Adequate tissue was obtained in all of the 13 patients for histological evaluation; 12 of the 13 patients were reported to have adenocarcinoma while one patient had adenoma. There were no complications from the needle knife papillotomy in any of the patients.\nNeedle knife assisted ampullary biopsy appears to be a safe and effective diagnostic modality for periampullary carcinoma.","title":"Role of needle knife assisted ampullary biopsy in the diagnosis of periampullary carcinoma.","pubmedId":"22110838"}
