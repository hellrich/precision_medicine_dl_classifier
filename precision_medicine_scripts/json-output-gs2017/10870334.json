The tumor was initially suspected to be a carcinoid tumor, following percutaneous needle biopsy. Subsequently, a left upper lobectomy was performed, and a well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma was diagnosed histologically. Unlike the biphasic epithelial and stromal features of pulmonary blastoma, it was composed solely of malignant glands of embryonal appearance.","title":"Well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"10870334"}
