It has always been described as isolated without any associated anomaly.\nA 30-year-old woman was referred to our department for dysmenorrhea and primary infertility. Hysterosalpingography showed the presence of a right (RT) hemiuterus with a patent fallopian tube; further evaluation with 2- and 3-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging showed an externally normal-appearing uterus, a right normal hemicavity connected normally with the existed cervix and, a left hemicavity fully divided from the right one by a complete septum and not connected with the cervix. Interestingly, a peculiar complex mass with cystic areas, attached posterolaterally from the left side to the uterine wall at the level of the isthmus and the upper cervix, was also diagnosed.\nThe study protocol was approved by our local institutional review board. During outpatient hysteroscopy, a right uterine hemicavity with a single ostium was identified without any communication with the left hemicavity. The patient was then scheduled for combined laparoscopic and hysteroscopic treatment. During laparoscopy, a normal uterine body with multiple myomas and a pseudocystic lesion attached posteriorly and left laterally to the uterus at the level of the isthmus and the upper cervix were shown; no communication between the cystic part of that lesion and the isthmus or the cervicovaginal canal was observed. During hysteroscopy, a longitudinal incision of the septum with a 5F bipolar electrode was performed; the left hemicavity was opened, and the corresponding tubal ostium was identified. The pseudocystic lesion was then excised after opening and sent for pathological analysis; the defect was closed with interrupted intracorporeal knots.\nA single normal endometrial cavity with both tubal ostia was obtained, thus restoring obstruction by unification of the uterine cavity. A histologic report of the removed pseudocystic lesion was compatible with the diagnosis of mullerian remnants. A follow-up hysteroscopy 3Â months after showed a normal uterine cavity without postsurgical adhesions.\nThe use of 3-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in combination with the new ESHRE/ESGE classification system gives the opportunity to obtain a precise representation of the female genital anatomy even in the presence of complex anomalies. Although a septate uterus with unilateral cervical aplasia has been already described, the presence of mullerian remnants is a rare entity associated with cyclic pelvic pain, thus needing adequate recognition and treatment. The combined hysteroscopic and laparoscopic approach offers a unique opportunity for the treatment of complex anomalies.","title":"An Exceptional Case of Complete Septate Uterus With Unilateral Cervical Aplasia (Class U2bC3V0/ESHRE/ESGE Classification) and Isolated Mullerian Remnants: Combined Hysteroscopic and Laparoscopic Treatment.","pubmedId":"26391060"}
