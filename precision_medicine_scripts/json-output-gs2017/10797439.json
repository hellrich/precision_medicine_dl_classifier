Many genes involved in familial cancers are frequently altered in the corresponding sporadic forms. We have investigated several genes known to be altered in sporadic gliomas for their potential contribution to familial glioma. Fifteen glioma patients with a family history of brain tumors were identified through the Mayo Clinic Department of Neurology (nine diffuse astrocytomas, two oligodendrogliomas, two mixed oligoastrocytomas, one pilocytic astrocytoma, and one pineal glioma). Eleven of the propositi had one or more first degree relative with a glioma. Lymphocyte DNA was derived from each of the patients and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing of the PTEN, p53, p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF), and CDK4 genes. In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on EBV-transformed lymphocytes from each affected individual to detect germline copy number of the p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) tumor suppressor region. A p53 germline point mutation was identified in one family with some findings of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and a hemizygous germline deletion of the p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) tumor suppressor region was demonstrated by FISH in a family with history of both astrocytoma and melanoma. Thus, whereas germ-line mutations of PTEN, p53, p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF), and CDK4 are not common events in familial glioma, outside of familial cancer syndromes, point mutations of p53 and hemizygous deletions and other rearrangements of the p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) tumor suppressor region may account for a subset of familial glioma cases. Collectively, these data lend genetic support to the heritable nature of some cases of glioma.","title":"Investigation of germline PTEN, p53, p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF), and CDK4 alterations in familial glioma.","pubmedId":"10797439"}
