We identified monoallelic truncating PALB2 mutations in 10/923 individuals with familial breast cancer compared with 0/1,084 controls (P \u003d 0.0004) and show that such mutations confer a 2.3-fold higher risk of breast cancer (95% confidence interval (c.i.) \u003d 1.4-3.9, P \u003d 0.0025). The results show that PALB2 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene and further demonstrate the close relationship of the Fanconi anemia-DNA repair pathway and breast cancer predisposition.","title":"PALB2, which encodes a BRCA2-interacting protein, is a breast cancer susceptibility gene.","pubmedId":"17200668"}
