Both genes are candidates for the putative tumour suppressor genes located at chromosome 9p21 and are frequently inactivated in many human cancers through homozygous deletion. More recently, another reported pathway of inactivation involves loss of transcription associated with de novo methylation of the 5\u0027 CpG island of p16/MTS1 and p15/MTS2 in human cancers. We examined a total of 34 tumours from 30 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for deletion, mutation and DNA methylation of these two genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, sequence analysis and Southern blot. Homozygous deletions of P16/MTS1 exon 1 were only identified in 1 of 30 cases (3%). Homozygous deletions of p15 exon 1 or exon 2 were found in 7 of 30 cases (13%). Automated sequencing analysis of p16 exon 1 and 2 and p15 exon 1 and 2 failed to demonstrate mutations in either p16 or p15 in any of these specimens. No aberrant 5\u0027 CpG island hypermethylation of p16 or p15 was found in any of the primary tumours by Southern blot. These data suggest that the p16/MTS1 gene has a limited role in HCC. However, deletions of the p15/MTS2 gene are found in 13% HCC and might be involved in a subset of HCC.","title":"Infrequent mutations and no methylation of CDKN2A (P16/MTS1) and CDKN2B (p15/MTS2) in hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan.","pubmedId":"9893670"}
