GISTs represent a distinct category of tumors characterized by oncogenic mutations of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase in a majority of patients. KIT is useful not only for the diagnosis but also for targeted therapy of this disease. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is widely used in advanced and metastatic GISTs. This agent revolutionized the treatment strategy of advanced disease and is being tested in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings with encouraging results. New therapeutic agents like sunitinib have now been approved, enriching the treatment scenario for imatinib-resistant GISTs. The present review reports on the peculiar characteristics of this disease through its biology and molecular patterns, focusing on the predictive value of KIT mutations and their correlation with clinical outcome as well as on the activity of and resistance to approved targeted drugs.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs): from science to targeted therapy.","pubmedId":"18629782"}
