This study aimed to describe the physical functionality and self-rated health status of adult patients with clinical knee osteoarthritis presenting at the Family Medicine Department, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria.\nThis was a cross-sectional study of 400 respondents. Knee osteoarthritis was diagnosed clinically using the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Morbidities, self-rated health status and physical functionality of the respondents were also assessed.\nKnee osteoarthritis was diagnosed in 46(11.5%) respondents. Respondents with knee osteoarthritis significantly rated their health worse than those without knee osteoarthritis (p \u003c0.0001). Experience of pain, stiffness and performance of daily activities were significantly worse among respondents with knee osteoarthritis. Those who had knee osteoarthritis had significantly higher waist (p \u003c0.0001), hip (p \u003c0.0001) and knee circumferences (p \u003c0.0001) respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed increasing age (OR\u003d1.103; 95% CI\u003d1.022 - 1.191), self-rated health worse than six months ago (OR\u003d12.562; 95% CI\u003d1.178-125.243), experience of stiffness after waking up in the morning (OR\u003d12.758; 95% CI\u003d3.572-45.569), stiffness after sitting/lying down/resting (OR\u003d21.517; 95% CI\u003d2.213-209.220) and waist circumference (OR\u003d1.225;95% CI\u003d1.017-1.477) to be the most significantly associated with knee osteoarthritis.\nKnee osteoarthritis significantly impairs the health and daily activities of adult patients in Ibadan, Nigeria. Healthcare workers need to screen adult patients routinely at first-contact to detect knee osteoarthritis clinically early and manage appropriately.","title":"Physical functionality and self-rated health status of adult patients with knee osteoarthritis presenting in a primary care clinic.","pubmedId":"25489196"}
