Between 1995 and 1999, 883 deaths from lung cancer (44.8/100,000 person-years) occurred. An initial finding indicated that hypertension increased the mortality risk of lung cancer [risk ratio (RR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.5]. However, after stratification for smoking status, the risk ratio was increased only for current smokers (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.6). When the interaction term was included in the multivariate model, there was a significant interactive effect of hypertension with current smoking (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.1) on the risk of death from lung cancer, whereas the effect of hypertension itself did not attain significance.\nHypertension was not an independent risk factor in lung cancer-related deaths, but it increased the modest risk of lung cancer death among current smokers.","title":"Does hypertension increase mortality risk from lung cancer?
