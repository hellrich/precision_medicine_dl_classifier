However, the involvement of the mutation in atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and multiple adenocarcinomas still remains unclear. We herein examined the EGFR mutations in 9 AAH and 31 adenocarcinoma lesions obtained from 30 Japanese patients. Nine patients had synchronous or metachronous multiple adenocarcinomas and/or AAH. Mutations in exons 18-21 of EGFR gene were analysed using polymerase chain reaction and direct sequence methods. EGFR mutations were detected in 4 (44%) of 9 AAH and in 7 (23%) of 31 adenocarcinomas. A gefitinib-resistant point mutation (T790M) in exon 20 without gefitinib treatment was detected in 1 AAH and 1 adenocarcinoma. The patient with T790M mutated AAH, which also had an exon 19 mutation of D761Y, had synchronous adenocarcinoma, which had only an exon 19 mutation of D761Y. The other exon 19 mutations were all in-frame deletions. In the two patients with synchronous AAH and adenocarcinoma, AAH had mutations at exon 19 although adenocarcinoma did not have any mutations. In the patient with synchronous 2 adenocarcinomas, each had different mutations (exons 19 and 21). In two patients with double adenocarcinomas, 1 adenocarcinoma harbored exon 21 mutations, while the other demonstrated no mutations. Although EGFR mutations appeared to be partially associated with the early steps of adenocarcinoma development, such mutations may possibly occur randomly even in multiple lesions in a single patient.","title":"Mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene in the development of adenocarcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"17561305"}
