One such agent, erlotinib (Tarceva), is a potent, selective and reversible inhibitor of HER1/EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. Erlotinib has demonstrated the clinical activity in a variety of solid tumors, and has recently demonstrated improvements in survival in large Phase III trials, in non-small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.","title":"Targeting HER1/EGFR in cancer therapy: experience with erlotinib.","pubmedId":"16556021"}
