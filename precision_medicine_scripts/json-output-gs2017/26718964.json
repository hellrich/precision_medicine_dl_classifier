The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor controlling expression of its target genes in response to various stress stimuli. Mutations of the TP53 gene occur very frequently in lung carcinomas and they play an important role in both oncogenic transformation of lung epithelial cells and lung carcinoma progression. We determined the TP53 status in 42 samples of squamous cell lung carcinoma (SQCC) and 56 samples of lung adenocarcinoma (AC) by the functional analysis FASAY and its variant called split assay. Altogether, we detected 64 TP53 mutations in 63 patients and analyzed them by cDNA and gDNA sequencing. The TP53 mutations were found in 76.2% (32/42) of SQCC cases, and 55.4% (31/56) of ACs. Immunoblotting revealed the p53 protein accumulation in 18 samples (42.9%) among SQCC cases and 19 samples (33.9%) among AC cases. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization we detected loss of the TP53-specific 17p13.3 locus in 23 from 41 analyzed SQCC samples (56.1%) and in 20 from 54 analyzed AC samples (37.0%). We did not find any statistically significant differences in overall and disease-free survival in relation to TP53 status.","title":"Complex analysis of the p53 tumor suppressor in lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26718964"}
