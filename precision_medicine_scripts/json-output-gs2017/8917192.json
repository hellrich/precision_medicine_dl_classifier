In a first step, 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg of F6-734 bispecific antibody was injected intravenously. Four days later, 6 nmole (5.8 to 9.8 mCi) of 131I-labeled di-DTPA in-TL bivalent hapten were injected. Quantitative imaging was performed during one week after the second injection.\nAll 5 patients with MTC showed positive immunoscintigraphy (IS). In the smallest visualized and resected tumor (0.8 g), the fraction of injected activity per gram (% ID/g) was 0.1% at Day 3. IS was positive in 4 of the 5 patients with SCLC. The volume of the smallest visualized SCLC tumor was estimated at 11 +/- 2 ml, and tumor uptake was about 0.009% ID/g. Tumor dose estimates ranged from 4.2 to 174 cGy/mCi in patients with MTC and from 1.7 to 8 cGy/mCi in patients with SCLC.\nHigh absorbed dose values were calculated for small MTC recurrences. For SCLC recurrences the values were smaller but in the same range as those obtained by other investigators with the one-step technique in lymphoma.","title":"Bispecific antibody and iodine-131-labeled bivalent hapten dosimetry in patients with medullary thyroid or small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"8917192"}
