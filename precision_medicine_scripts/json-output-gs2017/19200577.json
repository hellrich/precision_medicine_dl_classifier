Mechanisms of inactivation of the p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p14(ARF) have been reported in many human cancers but have not hitherto been studied in liver fluke-related cholangiocarcinoma, particularly genetic and epigenetic effects on protein expression. We investigated loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability and performed fine mapping of the chromosomal region 9p21-pter in 94 microdissected cholangiocarcinoma samples using polymerase chain reaction based-microsatellite markers. Methylation and protein expression of p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), and p16(INK4a) was determined using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Genetic and epigenetic alterations, including loss of protein expression, were correlated with clinicopathological data. Fine mapping at 9p21-pter showed a distinctive region between D9S286 and D9S1752 of common loss. Methylation frequency was 40.2% for p14(ARF), 48.9% for p15(INK4b), and 28.3% for p16(INK4a). Loss of protein expression of p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), and p16(INK4a) was 30.9%, 58%, and 81.5%, respectively. Both p14(ARF) methylation and allelic loss at 9p21 were associated with loss of p14(ARF) expression. Poor prognosis was associated with loss of p16(INK4a) expression. In conclusion, mechanisms of inactivation of p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), and p16(INK4a) in liver fluke-related cholangiocarcinoma are preferentially different, by which epigenetic event being the main mechanism of p14(ARF), whereas p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) inactivation occurs through genetic and both genetic and epigenetic events, respectively.","title":"Preferentially different mechanisms of inactivation of 9p21 gene cluster in liver fluke-related cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19200577"}
