We report a case occurring in a 68-year-old male. An elastic soft mass, apart from the testis, was palpated in the right scrotum. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 4 cm mass along the right spermatic cord. High orchiectomy was performed. Histologically, the mass was composed of lymphocytic aggregates, and paucicellular stroma with multinucleated cells. The adjacent lipoma-like lesion was clearly defined, and the mass was pathologically diagnosed as well-differentiated inflammatory liposarcoma.","title":"[Well-differentiated inflammatory liposarcoma occurring in the scrotum: a case report].","pubmedId":"17252983"}
