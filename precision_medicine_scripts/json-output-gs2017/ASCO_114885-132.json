In a phase II neoadjuvant clinical trial targeting EGFR in TNBC, we investigated various biomarkers to better identify an EGFR-sensitive population for potential further regimen development.  Methods:  Sixty patients (pts) with stage II-IIIA TNBC were prospectively included. Systemic treatment (ST) consisted of the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab combined with FEC 100, followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel. All pts underwent surgery after ST completion. Patient characteristics: median tumor size: 40 mm (20-120); invasive ductal carcinoma: 96.7%; SBR grade III: 71.7%; complete pathological response (pCR) rate: 55.3% and 46.8% (according to Sataloffs and Chevalliers classifications, respectively). Paraffin-embedded and frozen tumor samples were collected before and after ST for biologic studies. Germinal BRCA1 mutations, and EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and PI3KCA somatic mutations were analyzed by NGS. EGFR, IGF-1R, MET, cytokeratins 5/6 and 8/18, PTEN, P-cadherin, ALDH1, Ki-67, p53, tumoral FOXP3 expression and the number of FOXP3+ or CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were evaluated by IHC.  Results:  High CD8+ TILs was response-predictive (p\u003d3.4.10-6). Tumor FOXP3 expression and high FOXP3 TILs tended to be predictive. High IGF-1R expressors responded better than low expressors (p \u003d 0.028).  Comparison of EGFR, IGF-1R and Her3 in biopsies versus surgical samples showed reduced EGFR levels in non-responders (p \u003d 0.037), while Her3 (p \u003d 0.049) and IGF-1R (p \u003d 0.08) increased.  Sequencing revealed BRCA1 mutations in 10% of pts. No difference of response (pCR) was observed between mutated patients and others. Somatic mutations of PI3K were observed in 6 pts. No mutations were observed in BRAF, KRAS, or EGFR.  Conclusions:  The CD8+ TIL count seems to predict the response to panitumumab. Tumor FOXP3 expression and high FOXP3 TILs also tended to be predictive. Tumor levels of IGF-1R seem to play a determinant role in TNBC response to anti-EGFR antibodies, in concordance with our observations in a head-and-neck cancer cohort.
