Seven of the patients had been deemed not fit to stand a Whipple\u0027s operation. One patient died within 1 month postoperatively. Median postoperative survival was 22 months, and mean survival was 33 months. One patient is alive 11 years after the operation. Where the tumor is localized, the procedure may be considered a suitable treatment for the patient whose general condition does not allow a more extensive operation.","title":"Local excision for ampullary carcinoma.
