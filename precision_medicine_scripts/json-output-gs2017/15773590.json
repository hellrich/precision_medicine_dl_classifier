As a sign of malignancy, intestinal tumors particularly tend to metastasize, primarily in the abdominal cavity and in the liver. The authors present a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the intestine, which metastasized to the ovary. The tumor presented as a pelvic mass, mimicking an ovarian neoplasm. In the case of clinically simultaneous tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and of the ovary, one has to consider the possibility of a primary gastrointestinal tumor and first of all a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The histological diagnosis is essential because of the tumor-specific chemotherapeutical opportunity of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","title":"[Gastrointestinal stromal tumor metastasized to the ovary].","pubmedId":"15773590"}
