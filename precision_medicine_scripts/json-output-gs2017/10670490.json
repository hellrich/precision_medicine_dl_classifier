FGFR1 expression was analyzed immunohistochemically and at the transcription level in single photoreceptor cells, after reverse transcription (RT), using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Real time quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure changes in FGFR1 mRNA levels in the retina in response to injury or detachment.\nConfocal immunofluorescence observations showed that FGFR1 immunoreactivity in the rat retina is concentrated primarily in the perinuclear cytoplasm of photoreceptor cell bodies. Reverse transcription of total RNA derived from dissociated rat photoreceptor cells, followed by amplification of FGFR1 cDNA using the PCR, verified the presence of FGFR1 transcripts in normal rat photoreceptor cells; in contrast, no evidence of bFGF transcription was detected. Collectively, these results provide compelling evidence for FGFR1 gene expression by rat photoreceptors in situ. Within hours after experimental retinal detachment or focal injury, there is a twofold increase in FGFR1 immunoreactivity in the outer nuclear layer that persists for at least 7 days; a similar increase in bFGF immunoreactivity in the interphotoreceptor matrix is also apparent. This increase in FGFR1 protein levels after detachment and injury also was confirmed by western blot analysis. Real time quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that a rapid upregulation of FGFR1 mRNA occurred within 12 hours after retinal injury/detachment, but then declined to near baseline levels by 24 hours.\nThis body of evidence strongly suggests that the photoreceptor rescue effect elicited by retinal injury as well as by injection of exogenous bFGF is mediated, at least in part, by upregulation of the FGFR1 by the photoreceptor cells.","title":"Rapid upregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (flg) by rat photoreceptor cells after injury.","pubmedId":"10670490"}
