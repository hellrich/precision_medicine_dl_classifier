In normal fetal livers (n\u003d25), primitive biliary epithelia were almost negative for PKR. In primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (n\u003d30), damaged bile ducts were frequently positive for PKR, while uninvolved bile ducts were negative. In hepatolithiasis (n\u003d27), proliferated bile ducts were positive for PKR, and the PKR score correlated with the degree of proliferation. In cholangiocarcinoma (CC) (n\u003d44), PKR expression was frequently noted, and the PKR score correlated with good differentiation of CC, being highest in well-differentiated CC and lowest in poorly-differentiated CC. The PKR score decreased in the following order: CC (mean PKR score\u003d3.96), hepatolithiasis (2.56), PBC (1.60), normal fetal liver (0.40), and normal adult livers (0.00). The PKR expression in hepatocytes was \"baseline\" in normal adult livers, while moderately increased in fetal livers, PBC, hepatolithiasis and CC.\nAlthough the significance of these data is unclear, they suggest (i) that PKR is absent in bile ducts in normal adult and fetal livers, (ii) that PKR in bile duct cells newly emerges or increases in PBC, hepatolithiasis, and CC, (iii) that PKR accumulates in damaged bile ducts in PBC, (iv) that PKR increases in parallel with biliary cell proliferation in hepatolithiasis, and (v) that PKR expression correlates with differentiation in CC. PKR expression in intrahepatic bile ducts seems to be associated with inflammation or cell proliferation of the bile duct cells.","title":"Protein expression of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) in intrahepatic bile ducts in normal adult livers, fetal livers, primary biliary cirrhosis, hepatolithiasis and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"11169059"}
