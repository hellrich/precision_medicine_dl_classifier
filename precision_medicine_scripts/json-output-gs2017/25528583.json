However, the clinical significance of Mycl1 expression in gastric cancer is still unknown. Mycl1 expression was detected on tissue microarrays of gastric cancer samples in 176 cases using immunohistochemical staining, and its association with clinicopathological factors and overall survival was also analyzed. Mycl1 showed greater expression in gastric cancer tissue than in adjacent normal tissue (62.5% vs 46.0%, respectively, P\u003d0.002), and its expression was correlated with patient age, tumor differentiation, and TNM stage (P\u003d0.007, 0.003, and 0.002, respectively). The Mycl1 positive group had an unfavorable outcome compared with the negative group (P\u003c0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that Mycl1 expression was an independent prognostic factor of gastric cancer (P\u003d0.009). These results suggest that Mycl1 expression might be useful as a biomarker to predict prognosis and is a promising therapeutic target for patients with gastric cancer.
