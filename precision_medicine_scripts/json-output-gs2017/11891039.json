They represent 7% of lung cancer resections (387) and 27% of those performed after neoadjuvant treatment (100 cases). Histology was: 17 epidermoid carcinoma, 8 adenocarcinoma and 2 SCLC. Twenty-four patients (89%) received a preoperative cisplatin based polichemotherapy, and three cases (11%) a chemo-radiation therapy. A right sleeve lobectomy or bilobectomy was undertaken in 21 patients (78%) and a left lobectomy in 6 (22%). A resection of tracheal carina was associated in three cases and a vascular resection in 10 (five vena cava and five pulmonary artery). Twelve patients (44%) received adjuvant mediastinal irradiation. Perioperative morbidity of the study group (group 1) was compared with that of patients submitted to sleeve resection without neoadjuvant treatment (group 2), or standard pneumonectomy after induction treatment (group 3).\nThere were no postoperative deaths. A major perioperative complication occurred in two patients (7%) of group 1, one patient of group 2 (3.5%), and four in group 3 (17%). Among patients of the study group, no anastomotic dehiscence or pleural empyema were observed. Only one late anastomotic stricture occurred after postoperative radiation treatment. No significant difference in early and late complication rate was found between the three groups of patients. High rate of complete resection was achieved (93%) in patients of the study group and extent of nodal dissection was similar between sleeve resections and pneumonectomy patients.\nPreoperative chemotherapy or combination of chemo-radio therapy is not associated with an additional risk of anastomotic complications in bronco and angioplastic procedures. Parenchyma sparing resection is a valid option for selected patients with locally advanced lung cancer after induction treatment. A longer follow up is necessary to evaluate efficacy of the procedure in term of survival and local control.","title":"Low morbidity of bronchoplastic procedures after chemotherapy for lung cancer.","pubmedId":"11891039"}
