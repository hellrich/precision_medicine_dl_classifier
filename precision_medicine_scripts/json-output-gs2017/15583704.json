Despite advancements in radiation delivery, a number of patients will fail treatment. Salvage radical prostatectomy has been the main therapeutic option for locally recurrent radiation failure prostate cancer with curative intent. The operation is technically difficult to perform and associated with significant comorbidities. Salvage cryotherapy has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative option. In this article, we review the role of cryotherapy in recurrent prostate cancer and compare its outcome with salvage radical prostatectomy.","title":"Salvage cryosurgery for locally recurrent prostate cancer following radiotherapy.","pubmedId":"15583704"}
