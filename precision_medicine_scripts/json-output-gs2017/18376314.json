One EUS-FNA case that was cytologically atypical but not diagnostic of malignancy expressed B7-H4 and p53. Some benign tissue components (intercalated cells/ducts, main pancreatic ducts, and acinar cells) were also positive for B7-H4 and/or p53. Overall expression of B7-H4 in benign tissues, however, was relatively low compared with that seen in most carcinoma cases.\nB7-H4 was expressed more often in PDA than was p53. Despite potentially problematic expression in benign/normal cells, the 2 markers target different cellular components and demonstrate potential diagnostic use for detection of PDA in resected and EUS-FNA specimens.","title":"Detection of B7-H4 and p53 in pancreatic cancer: potential role as a cytological diagnostic adjunct.","pubmedId":"18376314"}
