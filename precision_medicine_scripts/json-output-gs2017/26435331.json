It binds at the plus ends of microtubules and has been shown to suppress plus end growth selectively. Because the class III β tubulin isotype is associated with resistance to microtubule targeting drugs, we sought to determine how βIII tubulin might mechanistically influence the effects of eribulin on microtubules. We found that while [(3)H]eribulin bound to bovine brain soluble tubulin depleted of βIII tubulin in a manner similar to that of unfractionated tubulin, it bound to plus ends of microtubules that were depleted of βIII-depleted tubulin with a maximal stoichiometry (20 ± 3 molecules per microtubule) higher than that of unfractionated microtubules (9 ± 2 molecules per microtubule). In addition, eribulin suppressed the dynamic instability behavior of βIII-depleted microtubules more strongly than and in a manner different from that of microtubules containing βIII tubulin. Specifically, with βIII tubulin present in the microtubules, 100 nM eribulin suppressed the growth rate by 32% and marginally reduced the catastrophe frequency (by 17%) but did not modulate the rescue frequency. However, in the absence of βIII tubulin, eribulin not only reduced the growth rate but also strongly reduced the shortening rate (by 43%) and the catastrophe and the rescue frequencies (by 49 and 32%, respectively). Thus, when present in microtubules, βIII tubulin substantially weakens the effects of eribulin.
