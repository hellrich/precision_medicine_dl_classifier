Clinical characteristics of these patients were retrospectively analyzed.\nTwo hundred and nineteen out of 297 patients reported clinical symptoms with variety. The main systemic symptoms included fever (100 cases, 33.7%), weight loss (50 cases, 16.8%) and fatigue (38 cases, 12.8%). Organ involvement included mucocutaneous (67 cases, 22.6%), respiratory (62 cases, 20.9%), gastrointestinal (40 cases, 13.5%) systems. Patients in AIDS phase were more symptomatic. Seventy-three out of 173 (42.2%)patients have been referred by 2 healthcare providers at least before the diagnosis of HIV infection was confirmed. Initial diagnoses were made in Departments of Infectious Diseases (36.9%), Gastroenterology (16.4%), and Emergency (13.7%). Opportunistic infections accounted for most AIDS defining conditions (ADC), including pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) (36 cases, 22.1%), cytomegalovirus infection (25 cases, 15.3%) and tuberculosis (22 cases, 13.5%). Median peripheral CD(+)4 T lymphocyte count in patients with ADC were 36 cells/Âµl.\nCommon clinical presentations of HIV/AIDS included fever, weight loss, diarrhea, short of breath and mucocutaneous lesions. Opportunistic infections mainly affected respiratory and gastrointestinal system, with PCP the most common one. The diagnosis of HIV infection was delayed in most cases, suggesting that more efforts are required especially in universal education of clinicians and accurate viral detection.","title":"[Clinical characteristics of 297 newly diagnosed Chinese HIV/AIDS patients].","pubmedId":"25264008"}
