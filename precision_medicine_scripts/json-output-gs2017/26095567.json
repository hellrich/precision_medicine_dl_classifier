The aim of this study was to assess reflux symptoms and quality of life (QOL) effects in patients undergoing esophageal stenting across the GE junction.\nWe performed a prospective single arm QOL clinical trial evaluating patients with stage 2/3 GE junction adenocarcinoma, undergoing neoadjuvant therapy (from baseline to 10 weeks post-stenting) after stenting across the GE junction, for GER symptoms and QOL-GER assessments (EORTC-QLQ-O25 and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Esophageal [FACT-E]).\nForty consecutive patients were enrolled in this clinical trial. The median age was 62 years (range 47 to 83 years); 84% were male and 19% were female patients. Median dysphagia score of 3 (only liquids tolerated) pre-stent was significantly improved to a score of 0 (ability to eat all foods) post-stent (p \u003d 0.01). There was a significantly improved and sustained swallowing QOL from 2 weeks up to 10 weeks post-stent. The GER-QOL scores were similar 2 weeks post-stent, but were significantly improved throughout the rest of the study. Proton pump inhibitors were being used in 58% of patients pre-stent and in 85% of patients at 2- to 10-week follow-up. Planned chemotherapy and/or chemo-radiation therapy was completed in 95% of all patients. Stent migration (radiologic and/or complete) was seen in 63% of patients at some time during their therapy and corresponded to pathologic response in 85% of those patients.\nEsophageal stenting across the GE junction remains the optimal therapy for dysphagia relief in esophageal malignancies and does not adversely affect a patient\u0027s GER-QOL. Esophageal stenting across the GE junction is not contraindicated and should be the initial therapy in patient management.","title":"Gastric-Esophageal Stenting for Malignant Dysphagia: Results of Prospective Clinical Trial Evaluation of Long-Term Gastroesophageal Reflux and Quality of Life-Related Symptoms.","pubmedId":"26095567"}
