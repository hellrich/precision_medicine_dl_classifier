Earlier diagnosis increases survival rate in patients. However, treatments for advanced disease are limited to hormone ablation techniques and palliative care. Thus, new methods of treatment are necessary for inhibiting progression of the disease. We have shown previously that microRNA-29b (miR-29b) expression was lower in prostate cancer cells as compared to prostate epithelial cells. Among the prostate cancer cell lines, metastatic prostate cancer cells displayed lowest expression of miR-29b. In this study, we have observed that PC-3M cells that constitutively overexpressed miR-29b failed to colonize the lungs and other organs of SCID mice after intravenous injection, while PC-3M cells expressing a control miRNA formed multiple nodules in the lung. PC-3M cells expressing miR-29b inhibited wound healing and invasiveness of cancer cells. Epithelial cell marker E-cadherin expression was enhanced in prostate cancer cells expressing miR-29b as compared to control cells. On the other hand, N-Cadherin and Snail1 expression were downregulated in PC-3M cells expressing miR-29b. Together these results suggested that miR-29b is an anti-metastatic miRNA in prostate cancer that acts at multiple steps of the metastatic cascade. Therefore, miR-29b could be a potentially new attractive target for therapeutic intervention in prostate cancer.","title":"Regulatory role of miR-29b in prostate cancer metastasis","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-130"}
