In all canine normal liver tissue samples the hepatocytes were negative for claudin-7 and the normal biliary epithelial cells showed intense basolateral membrane claudin-7 positivity. In all cholangiocellular hyperplasia samples and in all cholangiocellular adenoma samples the benign cholangiocytes showed intense basolateral membrane positivity for claudin-7. In all samples of the well-differentiated and poorly differentiated cholangiocarcinomas, the malignant neoplastic biliary epithelial cells showed intense basolateral membrane positivity for claudin-7. Neither the hyperplastic nodules of the liver cells nor the hepatocellular adenomas reacted with claudin-7. The well-differentiated and poorly differentiated hepatocellular cancers were negative for claudin-7. The epithelial cells of canine normal extrahepatic bile ducts, gall bladder and cystic mucinous hyperplasias of the gall bladder showed intense basolateral membrane positivity for claudin-7. Differences in the intensity of claudin-7 reaction were not apparent among different types of proliferative lesions of cholangiocytes or degrees of cellular differentiation of neoplastic biliary epithelial cells.\nConsequently, we hypothesize that claudin-7 is an excellent immunohistochemical marker of the cholangiocellular differentiation in canines and can be used to detect benign and malignant proliferative lesions of the canine biliary tract. It can also help to differentiate canine cholangiocarcinomas from hepatocellular carcinomas.","title":"Claudin-7 protein differentiates canine cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20503174"}
