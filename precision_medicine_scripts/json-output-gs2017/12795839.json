The expression index between these two groups was compared.\nThe positive axillary lymph node rate and the mean expression of VEGF, bFGF in the young group were higher than postmenopausal group (P \u003c 0.01 and P \u003c 0.05), respectively. The mean expression of VEGF, bFGF, FLK-1 and FLG of axillary lymph node positive patients was higher than the negative ones both in young and postmenopausal women groups (P \u003c 0.05 and P \u003c 0.01). There was also a significant difference in VEGF, bFGF, FLK-1, FLG and MVC between the stage 0 - II and stage III - IV (P \u003c 0.05 and P \u003c 0.01) in both groups.\nBreast cancer angiogenesis, characterized by the high expression of VEGF and bFGF, is directly correlated with the high tumor aggressiveness in the young women.","title":"[Difference in expression of VEGF, bFGF and their receptors between the young and postmenopausal women with breast cancer].","pubmedId":"12795839"}
