The exact mechanism for this association with worsened prognosis is unclear. It has been theorized that TAMs are immunomodulated to an alternatively activated state and promote tumor progression. Similarly, TANs have been shown to promote angiogenesis and tumor detachment. TAMs and TANs were characterized for activation state and production of prometastatic mediators in an immunocompetent murine model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Specimens from liver metastases were evaluated by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. TAMS have upregulated expression of CD206 and CD163 markers of alternative activation, (4.14 ± 0.55-fold and 7.36 ± 1.13-fold over control, respectively, P \u003c 0.001) but do not have increased expression of classically activated macrophage markers CCR2 and CCR5. TAMs also express oncostatin M (OSM). We found that TANs, not TAMs, predominantly produce matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in this metastatic tumor microenvironment, while MMP-2 production is pan-tumoral. Moreover, increased expression of VEGF colocalized with TAMs as opposed to TANs. TAMs and TANs may act as distinct effector cells, with TAMs phenotypically exhibiting alternative activation and releasing OSM and VEGF. TANs are localized at the invasive front of the metastasis, where they colocalize with MMP-9. Improved understanding of these interactions may lead to targeted therapies for pancreas adenocarcinoma.","title":"Activation state of stromal inflammatory cells in murine metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22422663"}
