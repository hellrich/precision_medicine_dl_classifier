The NRA is thought to modulate abdominal pressure in the framework of respiration, vomiting, vocalization, probably parturition, and, in all likelihood mating behavior. The NRA exerts this control through its projections to motoneurons to the nucleus ambiguus in the lateral medulla (innervating pharynx, larynx), and spinal cord (innervating cutaneous trunci, intercostal, abdominal, pelvic floor, and lower limb muscles). The nature of these NRA-motoneuronal projections is unknown. In this study we have determined the ultrastructure of the NRA-motoneuronal projections, and especially those to the abdominal external oblique and cutaneous trunci muscles. In four cats 0.1% cholera toxin subunit b was injected in the external oblique and cutaneous trunci muscles to retrogradely label their motoneurons in the spinal cord. Wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was injected into the NRA to anterogradely label its contralaterally descending fibers to the motoneurons of both muscles. In order to prevent anterograde labeling of ipsilaterally descending systems not originating from the NRA, a hemisection was made at the level of C2 prior to the NRA injection. The ultrastructural results indicate that the majority (60-74%) of the anterogradely labeled NRA-terminals made monosynaptic contacts with retrogradely labeled dendrites of the external oblique and the cutaneous trunci muscle motoneurons. The majority (86-95%) of the NRA terminals made asymmetric synaptic contacts and 79-84% contained round vesicles. These results demonstrate the existence of direct, presumably excitatory, projections from NRA to external oblique and cutaneous trunci muscle motoneurons.","title":"Ultrastructural evidence for direct excitatory retroambiguus projections to cutaneous trunci and abdominal external oblique muscle motoneurons in the cat.","pubmedId":"16377430"}
