We found allelic deletions of 9p21-p22 in 85% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Analysis of MTS1 in pancreatic carcinomas (27 xenografts and 10 cell lines) showed homozygous deletions in 15 (41%) and sequence changes in 14 (38%). These included eight point mutations (four nonsense, two missense and two splice site mutations) and six deletions/insertions, all accompanied by loss of the wild-type allele. Sequencing of MTS1 from primary tumours confirmed the mutations. Coexistent inactivations of both MTS1 and p53 was common and suggests that abnormal regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases may play an important role in the biology of pancreatic carcinoma.","title":"Frequent somatic mutations and homozygous deletions of the p16 (MTS1) gene in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"7726912"}
