Degenerative process starts in this age and complications and sequelae of chronic long-term diseases eg, hypertension and diabetes make their appearance. In the elderly multiple pathologies are often encountered. Common disease conditions found in the elderly are: Parkinson\u0027s disease, depression, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, tuberculosis and cancer of the lung, osteo-arthritis of various joints, diabetes, hypertension, cataract, hearing loss and so on. While suggesting food for the elderly, one should take into account the small amounts of food with minimum sugar and fats but lots of fresh vegetables and fruits taken in small quantities but more frequently. Physical activity and exercise is good at all ages including old age. Psychological problems frequently arise among the elderly. They result from many factors eg, difficulties with memory, loss of hearing, financial difficulties, feeling of insecurity, chronic unrelieved pain, diffuse atrophy of the brain, etc. Depression is the commonest of the psychological problems of the aged. Alzheimer\u0027s disease, dementia are some other problems often arise out of the ageing process. All old people and not-so-old ones should be encouraged to continue stimulating mental activity with the same vigour as we advise them to continue physical activity.","title":"Approach to the problems of the aged.","pubmedId":"15200203"}
