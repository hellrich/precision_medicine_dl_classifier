The following data were collected and reviewed: patient characteristics, tumor histology, surgical outcome, resection margins, morbidity, and mortality. All patients were thoroughly evaluated preoperatively by complete hematologic investigations, triple-phase helical computed tomography, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and biopsy of ampullary lesions (when present). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was performed for doubtful cases of lower common bile duct lesions.\nThere was no perioperative mortality. LPD was performed with tumor-free margins in all patients, including patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 6), ampullary carcinoma (n \u003d 6), intra-ductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (n \u003d 2), pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma (n \u003d 2), pancreatic head adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 3), and bile duct cancer (n \u003d 2). The mean patient age was 65 years (range, 42-75 years). The median blood loss was 240 mL, and the mean operative time was 368 min.\nLPD using a reverse-\"V\" approach can be performed safely and yields good results in elective patients. Our preliminary experience showed that LDP can be performed via a reverse-\"V\" approach. This approach can be used to treat localized malignant lesions irrespective of histopathology.","title":"Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy via a reverse-\u0027\u0027V\u0027\u0027 approach with four ports: initial experience and perioperative outcomes.","pubmedId":"25663778"}
