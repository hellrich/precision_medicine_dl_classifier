Two hundred twenty-five breast cancer biopsies possessed bFGFR (basic FGF receptor). The median dissociation constant was 0.35 nM (range, 0.014-1.9), and the median concentration was 1126 fmol/mg protein (range, 49-7328). FGFR-1 was localized, using a specific monoclonal antibody, in cancerous cells and in epithelial cells in normal breast or in benign tumors. In all of the tissues studied, light stromal cell staining was also observed. Thus, the localization of FGFR-1 in carcinoma cells supports the hypothesis that an important part of FGF-2 binding reflects binding to FGFR-1. bFGFR concentrations were positively correlated to estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor levels. Cox univariate analyses showed that the bFGFR (\u003e or \u003d upper quartile) was associated to longer relapse-free survival [P \u003d 0.004; RR (risk ratio), 0.46] and overall survival (P \u003d 0.001; RR, 0.35); age, estrogen receptor levels, progesterone receptor levels, node involvement, tumor diameter, and histoprognostic grading were prognostic, also. In Cox multivariate analyses, only the bFGFR, age, node involvement, and histoprognostic grading were prognostic factors; the bFGFR was associated with longer relapse-free survival (P \u003d 0.03; RR, 0.4) and overall survival (P \u003d 0.009; RR, 0.3). The present study confirms that FGF could be an important regulator of human breast cancer growth and that patients with a high level of bFGFR had a better prognosis.","title":"Basic fibroblast growth factor receptors and their prognostic value in human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"9865904"}
