{"publicationTypes":["English Abstract","Journal Article"],"abstract":"A case of primary jejunal liposarcoma is reported. Liposarcoma of the small intestine is very rare (four cases in the international literature). The early clinical symptoms of these malignancies are unclear non specific and for this reason the disease is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. The prognosis of these lesions is generally poor owing to the diffusion of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Usually small bowel neoplasms are preoperatively identified only in 27-72%. The percentage of surgical removal is from 65 to 80% according to the recent literature. Aim of this paper is to present a rare case of jejunal liposarcoma.","title":"[Primary jejunal liposarcoma].","pubmedId":"16498358"}
