The interstitial cells of Cajal or more primitive progenitor mesenchymal cells are suggested as their cells of origin. GIST\u0027s occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract but are generally located in the stomach and the intestine. About 70% of GIST\u0027s are immunohistochemically positive for CD34 and more than 90% for c-kit protein (CD117). About two thirds of GIST\u0027s are malignant. The tumor size, mitotic rate, cellularity and nuclear pleomorphism are the most important parameters characterizing the biological behavior of tumors. The diagnostic procedures are similar to those of other gastrointestinal neoplasms but only a half of the patients will have correct preoperative histological diagnosis. GIST\u0027s can be cured only by surgery. The procedure of choice, if possible, is resection without extended lymphadenectomy. Radiation and chemotherapy are generally ineffective.\n22 patients were operated on for GISTs in our department between 1996 and 2003.\nAll but one proved to be benign. The patients were all asymptomatic after the operation except the malignant case. In his case an irresectable local recurrence developed later.\nGIST is a rare neoplasm of the GI tract. The only possibility for treatment of GISTs is surgical removal.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).","pubmedId":"15816446"}
