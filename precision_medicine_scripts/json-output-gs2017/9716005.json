Dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a well-circumscribed round lesion with rapid and marked enhancement on T1-weighted images, without washout of the contrast agent. The enhanced area extended gradually from the margin to the center of the tumor, showing very late enhancement of the tumor center. The findings suggested a tumor with rich stromal component, including adenoid cystic carcinoma of a special type of breast cancer. Histological examination of a lumpectomy disclosed a well-circumscribed tumor consisting of ovoid, trabecular, and irregularly shaped \u0027nests\u0027 of tumor cells, with a focally cribriform pattern. The examination confirmed the diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast.","title":"Dynamic MR appearance of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast in a 67-year-old female.","pubmedId":"9716005"}
