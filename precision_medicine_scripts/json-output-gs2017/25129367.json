As the clinical significance of KRAS mutational status has not yet been clearly determined in this setting, our aim was to investigate the efficacy of erlotinib in advanced KRAS mutation-negative lung adenocarcinoma patients.\nMOTIVATE is an open-label, multicenter, observational trial with Tarceva(Â®) (erlotinib) monotherapy. Enrolled patients with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) KRAS wild type (WT) lung adenocarcinoma refractory to one or two courses of prior chemotherapy were treated with erlotinib at 150mg/day. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and best tumor response rate (RR).\nIn total, 327 patients were included. Median PFS and OS were 3.3 and 14.4 months, respectively. Three patients (1.2%) had complete response, 51 patients (20.2%) had partial response and 123 patients (48.8%) had SD. Significantly longer median PFS and OS were observed in Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-1 patients, as compared to ECOG PS 2-3 patients. The longest median OS (20.5 months) was found in patients with ECOG PS 0-1 who received erlotinib as a second-line therapy. There was no difference in median OS in cohorts stratified to disease stage and smoking status. Female patients had both longer median PFS and OS. Disease control rate was 70.2%. Our results suggest that erlotinib represents a valid treatment option for patients with KRAS WT lung adenocarcinoma and, moreover, that KRAS mutation analysis could help to identify clinically relevant subgroups of NSCLC patients that may benefit from EGFR-TKI therapy.","title":"Effectiveness of erlotinib treatment in advanced KRAS mutation-negative lung adenocarcinoma patients: Results of a multicenter observational cohort study (MOTIVATE).","pubmedId":"25129367"}
