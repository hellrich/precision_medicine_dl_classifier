Both agents are considered to be less toxic compared with cytotoxic drugs; however, serious adverse events including interstitial lung disease (ILD) which can be fatal occur rarely. After such an event, physicians avoid to use another TKI. In such cases, patients and physicians are forced to make difficult decisions or reluctantly choose TKI when there is no other option. Here we report a case of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who showed good recovery from gefitinib-induced ILD by high-dose corticosteroid therapy. The patient was then administrated erlotinib as second-line chemotherapy and showed tumor shrinkage without ILD after 6 months of treatment. We discuss the common features of the cases in the previous documentations and ours which were successfully retreated with erlotinib after gefitinib-induced ILD had previously developed.","title":"Successful treatment with erlotinib after gefitinib-induced interstitial lung disease: a case report and literature review.","pubmedId":"22853866"}
