Rates of subsequent acute cellular rejection were recorded. Multivariable analysis was performed to define variables associated with rejection and other clinically important end points.\nThirty (16%) of 190 men experienced acute cellular rejection. Lower pretransplant testosterone was associated with lower rejection rates, -7% (95% confidence interval [CI], -2% to -12%) per nmol/L decrease in total testosterone and -4% (95% CI, -0.5% to -7%) per 10 pmol/L decrease in free testosterone. Total testosterone (correlation 0.29, P\u003d0.04) and free testosterone (correlation 0.37, P\u003d0.01) correlated significantly with the histological severity of rejection. Older age at transplant (+5% [95% CI, 9%-2%]) per year, and nonautoimmune etiology of liver disease (OR, 1.0 for autoimmune, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.07-0.73] for hepatitis C virus, and 0.58 [95% CI, 0.21-1.71] for other etiologies) were also associated with decreased rejection risk. In a generalized linear model including the covariates testosterone, SHBG, age, etiology, and MELD, total testosterone remained a significant predictor of rejection (adjusted OR, 1.06; P\u003d0.03), as did age at transplant (OR, 0.95; P\u003d0.01).\nLow preliver transplant serum testosterone independently predicts a decreased risk of acute allograft rejection. Whether testosterone is a marker of disease-associated immune dysfunction or has immune-modulatory effects requires further study.","title":"Low-serum testosterone levels pre-liver transplantation are associated with reduced rates of early acute allograft rejection in men.","pubmedId":"24918618"}
