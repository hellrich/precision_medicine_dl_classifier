Hypoglycemia could contribute to drug resistance through many mechanisms such as activation of stress and survival pathways, and by altering tumour bioenergetics. The aim of this study was to evaluate if hypoglycemia reduces drug sensitivity, and test strategies to attenuate any resistance. Two gastric cancer (GC) cells with PIK3CA mutations (AGS, HGC27) and two without (MKN45, NUGC4) were cultured in routine high glucose (HG) (25mM) or low glucose (LG) (5mM) DMEM. The IC50s of PI103 (PI3K/mTOR inhibitor), and KU63794 (mTOR inhibitor) were measured at 72h using MTS assay. Protein and cell cycle analysis were performed by ELISA and PI/RNase staining respectively. Combination analysis was performed using combination index (CI) method of Chou and Talalay. Cells with mutant (mt) but not wildtype (wt) PIK3CA displayed significant resistance to both PI103 and KU63794 in LG compared to HG conditions (Table 1), despite having similar doubling times and cell cycle profiles. Basal protein analysis revealed increased p-mTOR, p-S6, p-4EBP1 and GLUT1 in PIK3CA mt cells grown in LG compared to HG conditions. The levels of these proteins did not differ in PIK3CA wt cells, in addition to p-Akt in all cells. The activation of the mTOR pathway prompted the testing of the combination of PI103 and KU63794. The combination was synergistic in AGS and HGC27 cells (CI\u003d0.09, p\u003d0.012 and CI\u003d0.13, p\u003d0.032 respectively) in LG conditions, and additive in HG conditions. Furthermore, synergy was associated with significant reduction in p-4EBP1 and extracellular lactate concentration. No synergy was seen in the wt cell lines. These results suggest that hypoglycemia can reduce drug sensitivity, and that resistance to PI103 and KU63794 in hypoglycemic conditions can be circumvented by combining the two agents.IC50 (M) of PI103 and KU63794 in HG and LG conditions, * p \u003c 0.01","title":"Attenuation of hypoglycemia-associated resistance to PI103 and KU63794 through their synergistic combination in PIK3CA-mutant gastric cancer cells.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-959"}
