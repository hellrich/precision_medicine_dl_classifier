A strong correlation was found between CCND1 amplification and CHK1 deletion (P\u003c0.0001). Fourteen cases were detected that demonstrated both CCND1 amplification and CHK1 deletion. Interestingly, when comparing the infiltrating and non-invasive areas for the same tumour, we found three cases with CCND1 amplification in the infiltrating areas but not in the DCIS areas. We did not find a CHK1 gene profile difference between infiltrating and DCIS areas in the same lesions.\nOur findings suggest that CCND1 amplification and CHK1 deletion are common events in breast cancer, and that the two genetic alterations often coexist. Our data also suggest that CHK1 deletion is an early genetic event in the development of breast cancer and can be detected at the DCIS stage, whereas CCND1 amplification is more likely to be associated with tumour progression.","title":"Detection of CHK1 and CCND1 gene copy number changes in breast cancer with dual-colour fluorescence in-situ hybridization.","pubmedId":"21401699"}
