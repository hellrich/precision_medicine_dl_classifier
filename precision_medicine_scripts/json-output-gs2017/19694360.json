Their diagnosis remains based on the morphology and immunohistochemistry. The evaluation of GIST prognosis was till know difficult to establish but a new histopronostic classification currently used allows a better therapeutic approach. The search for KIT and PDGFRA mutations is recommended to adapt a targeted therapy by KIT inhibitors. The pathologist plays a crucial role in the management of the GIST because it is on him that is based the diagnosis, the evaluation of the prognosis and the treatment (surgery and kit inhibitors).","title":"[The role of the pathologist in the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)].","pubmedId":"19694360"}
