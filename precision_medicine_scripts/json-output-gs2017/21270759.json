There have been case reports of colorectal cancer patients with isolated splenic metastasis, even after years of surgery in the literature.\nTo report two colorectal cancer cases with atypical metastasis.\nThe first patient was a 58-year old man who had isolated splenic metastasis after 20 months of surgery. The other one was a 51-year old male patient with both lung and renal metastasis at rectal cancer diagnosis. Splenic and renal metastases have been histopathologically documented in both of them. The first patient was given chemotherapy after splenectomy. The other one had also multiple lung metastases besides renal metastasis. He received palliative chemotherapy.","title":"Two cases with atypical metastasis in colorectal cancer: splenic and renal metastasis.","pubmedId":"21270759"}
