In order to investigate the downstream targets of DDIT3, and the transforming effects of the FUS-DDIT3 fusion protein, we have introduced DDIT3-GFP and FUS-DDIT3-GFP constructs into a human fibrosarcoma cell line. The gene expression profiles of stable transfectants were compared to the original fibrosarcoma cell line by microarray analysis. We here report that the NFkappaB and C/EBP beta controlled gene IL6 is upregulated in DDIT3- and FUS-DDIT3-expressing fibrosarcoma cell lines and in myxoid liposarcoma cell lines. Strong expression of the tumor associated multifunctional cytokine interleukin 6 was confirmed both at mRNA and protein level. Knockdown experiments using siRNA against CEBPB transcripts showed that the effect of FUS-DDIT3 on IL6 expression is C/EBP beta dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed direct interaction between the IL6 promoter and the C/EBP beta protein. In addition, the effect of DDIT3 and FUS-DDIT3 on the expression of other acute phase genes was examined using real-time PCR. We demonstrate for the first time that DDIT3 and FUS-DDIT3 show opposite transcriptional regulation of IL8 and suggest that FUS-DDIT3 may affect the synergistic activation of promoters regulated by C/EBP beta and NFkappaB.","title":"Myxoid liposarcoma FUS-DDIT3 fusion oncogene induces C/EBP beta-mediated interleukin 6 expression.","pubmedId":"15688424"}
