The gene for NF2 has recently been isolated on chromosome 22, and the demonstration of inactivating germline mutations in NF2 patients and NF2 associated tumours suggests that it act as a tumour suppressor. We have investigated 85 sporadic and 2 NF2 associated vestibular schwannomas, and one vagal schwannoma for chromosome 22 allele loss and NF2 gene mutations. A further 7 vestibular schwannomas were investigated for NF2 mutations only. Chromosome 22 allele loss was detected in 34 of 87 vestibular schwannomas and in the vagal nerve schwannoma. Six exons of the NF2 gene were investigated by SSCP analysis in all 95 tumours. Somatic NF2 gene mutations were detected in 13 non-familial vestibular schwannomas and in one of the NF2 vestibular schwannomas. Seven non-familial tumours with an NF2 gene mutation also displayed a chromosome 22 allele loss. Thirteen of the mutations were predicted to produce truncation of the NF2 protein. These results suggest that somatic mutations of the NF2 tumour suppressor gene are a critical step in the pathogenesis of both familial and non-familial vestibular schwannoma and that the mechanism of tumourigenesis complies with a \u0027two-hit\u0027 mutation model.","title":"Somatic NF2 gene mutations in familial and non-familial vestibular schwannoma.","pubmedId":"8004107"}
