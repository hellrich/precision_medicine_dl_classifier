The patients in the control group received no medication before surgical resection of gastric cancer, and those in octreotide group were given daily subcutaneous injection of 100 Âµg octreotide for 7 days before the surgery. The resected specimens were examined histologically and the expressions of p53 and Ras protein were detected by immunohistochemistry.\nCompared with the control group, gastric cancer tissue in octreotide group showed significantly increased necrosis (P\u003c0.05) and enhanced proliferation of fibrous tissues (P\u003c0.05) with lowered expressions of p53 and Ras protein (P\u003c0.05).\nOctreotide can inhibit the expressions of p53 and Ras and suppress the growth of the human gastric cancer.","title":"[Inhibitory effect of somatostatin analogue octreotide on the expression of p53 and Ras in human gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"21764706"}
