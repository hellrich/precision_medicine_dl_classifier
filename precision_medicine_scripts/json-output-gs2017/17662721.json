To identify novel amplicons involved in the mammary carcinogenesis, we constructed gene expression maps of chromosomes in 35 human breast cancer cell lines and extracted six candidate amplicons containing highly expressed gene clusters on chromosomes 8, 17, and X. We also confirmed the presence of the identified amplicons in clinical specimens by Southern blot analysis. Highly expressed genes identified in the amplicons will contribute to the characterization of breast cancer phenotypes, thereby providing novel targets for anticancer therapies.","title":"Novel clusters of highly expressed genes accompany genomic amplification in breast cancers.","pubmedId":"17662721"}
