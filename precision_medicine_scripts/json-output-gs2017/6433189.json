Complementary experiments were undertaken to clarify the results obtained. Embryo culture showed that sterility found after treatment with cyclophosphamide or with the high dose of mitomycin C was the reflection of true dominant lethal effects. Mortality after cyclophosphamide treatment occurred predominantly at the 2- and 3-cell stages, while it was reported in all preimplantation stages after treatment with the high dose of mitomycin C. Embryos treated with the low dose of mitomycin C developed normally to the blastocyst stage, confirming the absence of preimplantation effects found with this dose in the dominant lethal test. Cytogenetic analysis of female pronuclei at the first cleavage division were performed after mating treated females with males homozygous for one Robertsonian translocation. This method allowed one to distinguish easily the female pronuclei from the male ones, which exhibited one translocated \u0027marker\u0027 chromosome. After treatment with cyclophosphamide, most female pronuclei showed multiple chromatid exchanges or shattering of the entire genome. After treatment with the high dose of mitomycin C, various types of premature chromosome condensation were found, and they were often accompanied by important interchromosome associations. After treatment with the low dose of mitomycin C, no structural chromosome aberrations were found, and the number of numerical anomalies was not significantly different from that found in control embryos. These last results suggest that the increase in rate of postimplantation loss obtained in the dominant lethal test with the low dose of mitomycin C was not due to clastogenic effects of this compound in the female germ cells, but rather to indirect effects on the maternal organism.","title":"Morphological and cytogenetic studies of dominant lethality induced by mitomycin C and cyclophosphamide in female germ cells.
