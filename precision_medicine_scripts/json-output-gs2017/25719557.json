Recent progress in lung cancer diagnosis and treatment has been achieved due to a better understanding the molecular mechanisms of the disease and the identification of biomarkers that allow more specific cancer treatments. One of the best known examples of personalized therapy is the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, for the successful treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer patients selected based on the specific EGFR mutations. Therefore, the reliable detection of mutations is critical for the application of appropriate therapy. In this study, we tested a two-tiered mutation detection strategy using real-time PCR assays as a well-validated high-sensitivity method and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)-based EGFRmut+ assay as a second-tier standard-sensitivity method. One additional advantage of the applied MLPA method is that it allows the simultaneous detection of EGFR mutations and copy-number alterations (i.e., amplifications) in EGFR, MET and ERBB2. Our analysis showed high concordance between these two methods. With the use of this two-tier strategy, we reliably determined the frequency of EGFR mutations and EGFR, MET and ERBB2 amplifications in over 200 lung cancer samples. Additionally, taking advantage of simultaneous copy number and small mutation analyses, we showed a very strong correlation between EGFR mutations and EGFR amplifications and a mutual exclusiveness of EGFR mutations/amplifications with MET and ERBB2 amplifications. Our results proved the reliability and usefulness of the two-tiered EGFR testing strategy.
