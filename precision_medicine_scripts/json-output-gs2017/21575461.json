The clinicopathological data of enrolled patients such as age, sex, tumor size, tumor site, pathologic type, histodifferentiation, infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis, stage and survival were obtained, and were made one factor analysis of variance and COX regression prognostic analysis with those above mentioned markers. Follow-up was completed as of February 28, 2010. The median follow-up was 24 months.\nhTERT from gastric carcinomas and corresponding non-cancerous tissues was 16.98 ± 3.56 and 11.37 ± 2.15, respectively (P \u003c 0.05), the telomerase activity in gastric cancer was significantly higher than that in non-cancerous tissue (P \u003c 0.05). Telomerase activity showed a positive correlation with depth of invasion, tumor differentiation and nodal metastasis (P \u003c 0.01), and negative correlation with survival.\nGastric cancer with high hTERT mRNA expression indicates a more malignant potential. Detection of hTERT mRNA in gastric cancer may be useful in a better understanding of invasion, metastasis, as well as prognosis of gastric cancer and provide a more efficient therapy. The quantitative expression of hTERT mRNA, infiltration depth and pTNM stage are significant afactors affecting the prognosis of patients with gastric carcinoma.","title":"[Prognostic significance of hTERT mRNA quantitative expression in resected gastric carcinomas].","pubmedId":"21575461"}
