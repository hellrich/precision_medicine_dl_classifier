However, the generation of immortalized primary African American prostate cancer cells that will accurately reflect the in situ characteristics of malignant epithelium is currently limited but is greatly needed. We have successfully established immortalized cell lines of a pair of non-malignant and malignant tumors derived from an African American prostate cancer patient with HPV-16E6E7 (RC-77N/E and RC-77T/E). RC-77N/E and RC-77T/E cells are currently growing well at passage 40. Both cells exhibit epithelial morphology and are androgen sensitive. The RC-77T/E cells produced tumors in SCID mice whereas the RC-77N/E cells produced no tumor in SCID mice. These cells expressed androgen-regulated prostate-specific homobox gene, NKX 3.1, epithelial cell specific cytokeratn 8, androgen receptor (AR), prostate specific antigen (PSA), and p16. Chromosome analysis showed that both cell lines are similar; near diploid human male (XY) with most chromosome counts in the 45-48 range. However, RC-77T/E cell line has new marker chromosomes: M1B\u003ddel/t(4;?)(q28;?), M5\u003d16q+ in addition to those observed in the RC-77N/E cell line (M1\u003ddel(4)(q28q34)+hsr in some, M1A\u003dt(4q;?),M2\u003dder(9?),M2A\u003ddel(M2p-),M3\u003diso(?), M4\u003dder(22?)). This is the first documented case of the establishment of pair of non-malignant and malignant tumors derived from an African American prostate cancer patient. These models will provide novel tools to study the molecular and genetic mechanisms of prostate carcinogenesis, especially for high-risk African American men.","title":"Establishment and characterization of a pair of non-malignant and malignant tumor derived cell lines from an African American prostate cancer patient.","pubmedId":"21042716"}
