Due to the lack of screening programs in Western countries, most gastric cancers are diagnosed in advanced stages. A sophisticated staging should include high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis and video-documented endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound. In mucosal gastric cancer, endoscopic resection can replace surgical resection if specific criteria are present. In the stages II and III perioperative chemotherapy has been established as a standard of care and should be applied. In the metastatic setting, treatment goals are palliative. Chemotherapy can prolong survival, improve symptoms and can help to maintain a better quality of life. Combination chemotherapy including a platinum compound and a fluoropyrimidine regarded as standard. About 20 % of gastric cancers exhibit overexpression of the growth factor receptor family member Her2. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against Her2 and has shown to prolong survival when combined with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine.","title":"[Diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"20721843"}
