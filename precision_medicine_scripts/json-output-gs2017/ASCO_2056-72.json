Recently, clinical trials testing cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, with simultaneous radiation therapy have begun in this patient population. The discovery of Kristen-ras (KRAS) wild type status and EGFR gene mutation as markers of response to EGFR inhibitor monotherapy has allowed individualized cancer treatment in colorectal and lung cancer respectively. Neither of these markers is present in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the only tumor proven to be radiosensitized by Cetuximab. It is not yet known what mutations predict sensitivity to cetuximab with concurrent radiation. The objective of this study was to assess the KRAS and EGFR mutation status in squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. Methods: Mutation status of KRAS exon 2 and EGFR exon 19 and 21 was evaluated in 95 pretreatment formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded anal cancer tumor biopsies from patients treated between 1990 and 2009. DNA was extracted from verified tumor samples. Gene segments were amplified, their mutational status was assessed by High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis, and variants were confirmed by sequencing. Samples were tested in duplicate along with positive and negative controls that consisted of lung or colorectal cancer samples known to either contain the sought after mutation or to be wild-type. Results: KRAS exon 2 mutations were identified in 0/95 samples. EGFR exon 19 mutations were likewise absent in all 95 samples. Only three of the 95 samples scored positive by HRM for EGFR exon 21; however, sequencing revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs17290559) in all three samples. Conclusions: These results imply that, like SCCHN, squamous cell anal canal carcinoma lacks the most common mutations in KRAS and EGFR; suggesting anal cancer patients may likewise be radiosensitized by cetuximab.","title":"KRAS and EGFR gene mutation status in anal canal carcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_2056-72"}
