Overall survival rate at 5Â years is less than 5%. Surgical resection is still the only treatment providing prolonged survival but, even after a curative resection, 5-year survival rates are low. However, some patients have a slower tumor progression and increased median survival due to treatment advances and better patient selection. The objective of this review is to analyze the prognostic factors related to patient, treatment and tumor, to identify those associated with better long-term survival after resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"Prognostic factors for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"21924695"}
