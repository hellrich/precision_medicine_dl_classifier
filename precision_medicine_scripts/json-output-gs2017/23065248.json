GSTP1 is one of the important mutant sites reported at present. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association between GSTP1 and the risk of lung cancer. The association investigations were identified from PubMed and Cochrane Library, and eligible studies were included and synthesized using meta-analysis method. Forty-four reports were included into this meta-analysis for the association of GSTP1 A/G gene polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility, consisting of 12,363 patients with lung cancer and 13,948 controls. The association between GSTPI G allele and lung cancer risk was found in this meta-analysis (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.02-1.15, P \u003d 0.01). However, the GG genotype and AA genotype were not associated with the susceptibility of lung cancer. Furthermore, there was no association between GSTP1 A/G gene polymorphism and the risk of lung cancer in Caucasians, and East-Asians. In conclusion, GSTP1 G allele is associated with the lung cancer susceptibility. However, more studies on the relationship between GSTP1 A/G gene polymorphism and the risk of lung cancer should be performed in the future.","title":"Association of glutathione S-transferase P1 gene polymorphism with the susceptibility of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23065248"}
