Nine out of 10 gefitinib treated patients with disease control was found with EGFR mutation.\nThe data suggest that mutation frequency of EGFR in NSCLCs from Chinese patients is higher than that of western ethnicities, such mutations are well correlated with tumor response to gefitinib, and gefitinib is more fit for Chinese NSCLC patients.","title":"[Mutational analysis of EGFR and K-RAS in Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"17285540"}
