These mutated genes also cooperate in the immortalization and neoplastic transformation of rodent cells. To determine whether these mutations are necessary for maintenance of the immortalized and/or neoplastically transformed states of human bronchial epithelial cells, the p53 gene and regions of the ras (K-, H-, and N-) genes were sequenced in nine human lung carcinoma cell lines. Detection of p53 mutations by polymerase chain amplification and direct DNA sequencing was corroborated by p53 immunocytochemistry and coimmunoprecipitation of p53 with heat shock protein 70. p53 and ras genes were frequently, but not always, mutated in the carcinoma cell lines. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that multiple genetic changes involving both protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes occur during lung carcinogenesis.","title":"p53 mutations, ras mutations, and p53-heat shock 70 protein complexes in human lung carcinoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"1855224"}
