A case of asymptomatic renal angiomyolipoma in a 57-year-old female is reported. Her right renal mass was incidentally discovered during the evaluation of acute hepatitis by abdominal sonography. She received right simple nephrectomy. The renal pelvic tumor was found to be an angiomyolipoma with a prominent angiomatous component containing hematopoietic elements. Unfortunately, the patient died of peritoneal carcinomatosis because of adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon five years later.","title":"Renal angiomyolipoma with a prominent angiomatous component and extramedullary hematopoiesis: a case report.","pubmedId":"8174016"}
