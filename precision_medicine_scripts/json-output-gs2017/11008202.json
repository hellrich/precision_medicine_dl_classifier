Difficulties with this method are the lack of quantitative assessment of free cancer cells and the length of time before completion. To overcome these problems, we have established a rapid and quantitative detection method using a novel real-time fluorescence PCR system (LightCycler). Using this device with hybridization probes as fluorophores, we detected CEA mRNA in peritoneal washes during surgery (within 3 hr) without any post-PCR procedure. This method could reproducibly quantitate 10 to 10(6) CEA-expressing colon carcinoma cells per 10(7) peripheral blood leukocytes, a comparable sensitivity to conventional RT-PCR with a wide dynamic range. Analysis of peritoneal washes from 109 gastric-cancer patients with this assay revealed relative values of CEA transcripts that correlated well with the depth of tumor invasion (p \u003c 0.01). Average values of CEA transcript in peritoneal washes in patients with cytology (-)/RT-PCR(-), cytology (-)/RT-PCR(+) and cytology (+)/RT-PCR(+) results were 0.64, 1,525 and 6,715, respectively. Moreover, CEA transcripts in peritoneal washes in patients with synchronous peritoneal metastasis were more than 50-fold higher than in those without metastasis. These results suggest a positive correlation between CEA mRNA levels in peritoneal washes and prognosis. We conclude that real-time RT-PCR with hybridization probes is a sensitive, quantitative, specific and rapid method to detect free cancer cells in peritoneal washes. This clinically relevant system is a powerful technique to evaluate the risk of peritoneal recurrence in patients with gastric cancer.","title":"Rapid quantitative detection of carcinoembryonic antigen-expressing free tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity of gastric-cancer patients with real-time RT-PCR on the lightcycler.","pubmedId":"11008202"}
