When used as a single agent, gemcitabine yielded response rates consistently \u003e 20%, with a uniformly good tolerance profile. Preclinical data indicated synergism between gemcitabine and platinum compounds, such as cisplatin or carboplatin. The gemcitabine-cisplatin combination is considered one of the reference regimens for advanced NSCLC and the recommended schedule is gemcitabine 1000 - 1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 - 8 and cisplatin 70 - 80 mg/m(2) on days 1 or 2. In order to avoid many of the non-haematological toxicities associated with cisplatin, several trials evaluated the gemcitabine-carboplatin combination. Previous trials using the 28-day schedule showed unacceptable haematological toxicity. Recent studies demonstrated the activity and feasibility of gemcitabine-carboplatin combination using a 21-day schedule, with carboplatin administered on day 1 and gemcitabine on days 1 and 8. Gemcitabine can be combined with one of the other new agents, such as the taxanes or vinorelbine, to create novel non-platinum-doublets. Although encouraging, the available data are still conflicting and non-platinum-based combinations are not indicated outside clinical trials. Three-drug combinations increased toxicity and failed to demonstrate any advantage over standard doublets in advanced NSCLC. Gemcitabine is active and well tolerated in elderly patients and represents a reasonable therapeutic option. Although no Phase III trials have been conducted to compare gemcitabine to the best supportive care or docetaxel in pretreated NSCLC, gemcitabine alone or in combination with vinorelbine or one of the taxanes can be considered a valid option for second-line treatment in patients who had a previous response or who achieved stable disease with a platinum-containing regimen. Gemcitabine is considered the most radiopotentiating agent available amongst the newer agents we have in terms of activity and toxicity, but the routine use of gemcitabine in combination with radical thoracic radiotherapy, although promising, is not yet recommended. Further testing of gemcitabine-based combinations with concurrent radiation is underway.","title":"Gemcitabine in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"12036414"}
