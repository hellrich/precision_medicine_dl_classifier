Among people with diabetes, fatigue is a pervasive and distressing complaint, which is further accentuated by presence of depression.\nTo assess the prevalence of fatigue and depression and associated clinical and socio demographic correlates in type 2diabetes.\nThis cross sectional study included 100 patients of diabetes type 2 and equal number of healthy controls between the ages of 18 to 70 years. A detailed evaluation of socio demographic and clinical parameters was made. Participants were also assessed for presence of depression and fatigue using PHQ-9 and Fatigue Severity Scale(FSS)respectively.\nFatigue and depression was found in 68 % and 53 % of diabetic participants. Diabetic patients were 10.37 times and 4.80 times more likely to suffer from fatigue and depression respectively. Both fatigue and depression were found to be significantly associated with duration of illness, fasting and post prandial blood glucose level, diabetic complications and Body Mass Index (BMI). Fatigue was also strongly correlated with depression in study sample.\nFatigue and depression are reasonably correlated with type 2 diabetes. Various clinical parameters of diabetes are strongly associated with both fatigue and depression. Fatigue itself has significant correlation with depression in type 2 diabetes. Regular monitoring of biochemical parameters are paramount to predict the development of fatigue and depression in type 2 diabetes.","title":"Study of fatigue, depression, and associated factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus in industrial workers.","pubmedId":"27212824"}
