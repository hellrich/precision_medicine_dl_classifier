Of these, liposarcoma of the spermatic cord constitutes a rare tumor type with a good prognosis. It has a high rate of survival over 5 years. Inguinal orchiectomy generally suffices, although patients should be followed closely since local recurrence is not uncommon. The present study briefly reviews the literature on spermatic cord liposarcoma and reports an additional case that was treated exclusively by radical orchiectomy. Four years postoperatively the patient continues to be tumor-free.","title":"[Liposarcoma of spermatic cord. A rare urologic tumor].","pubmedId":"1444619"}
