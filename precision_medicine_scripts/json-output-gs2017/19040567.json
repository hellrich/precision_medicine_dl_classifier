The levels, mutual interactions, activities, and localization of G(1)/S regulators were analysed with respect to growth and differentiation parameters of the cells.\nWe demonstrate that proliferation parameters of differentiating cells correlate with the activity and structure of cyclin A/E-CDK2 but not of cyclin D-CDK4/6-p27 complexes. In an exponentially growing P19 cell population, the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex is detected, which is replaced by cyclin D2/3-CDK4/6-p27 complex following density arrest. During endodermal differentiation kinase-inactive cyclin D2/D3-CDK4-p27 complexes are formed. Neural differentiation specifically induces cyclin D1 at the expense of cyclin D3 and results in predominant formation of cyclin D1/D2-CDK4-p27 complexes. Differentiation is accompanied by cytoplasmic accumulation of cyclin Ds and CDK4/6, which in neural cells are associated with neural outgrowths. Most phenomena found here can be reproduced in mouse embryonic stem cells. In summary, our data demonstrate (i) that individual cyclin D isoforms are utilized in cells lineage specifically, (ii) that fundamental difference in the function of CDK4 and CDK6 exists, and (iii) that cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes function in the cytoplasm of differentiated cells. Our study unravels another level of complexity in G(1)/S transition-regulating machinery in early embryonic cells.","title":"Lineage specific composition of cyclin D-CDK4/CDK6-p27 complexes reveals distinct functions of CDK4, CDK6 and individual D-type cyclins in differentiating cells of embryonic origin.","pubmedId":"19040567"}
