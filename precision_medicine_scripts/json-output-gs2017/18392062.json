Overall, 1157 completed caregiver questionnaires were returned (68%) indicating that 47.5% of children walked to or from school less than three times per week. The strongest predictor of walking was proximity to school (\u003c1 km OR 29.3, 1-2 km OR 7.7, 2-3 km OR 3.0, \u003e3 km OR 1.00). Other predictors were not having a car in the household (OR 10.9), attending a (low socioeconomic) decile 2 to 4 school (2.35), having three or more adults in the household (1.85), being in a higher school year (1.72), having non-New Zealand European ethnicity (\u003e1.41), having a parent who had walked to school (1.35), and being male (1.33).\nThis study established a baseline for the percentage of Dunedin primary school children walking to school. Key potentially modifiable predictors of walking were proximity to school and not having a car in the household. These findings have implications for health, transport and educational policies.","title":"Walking to school: frequency and predictors among primary school children in Dunedin, New Zealand.","pubmedId":"18392062"}
