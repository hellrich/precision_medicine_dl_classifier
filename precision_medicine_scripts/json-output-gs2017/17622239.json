We studied the association of S6 kinase phosphorylation and HPV16 infection in cervical cancer and esophageal cancer. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess phosphorylated S6 kinase (Thr 389) and phosphorylated S6 (Ser235/236) in 140 cervical cancer and 161 esophageal cancer specimens. Immunohistochemical staining for pS6 kinase and pS6 was significantly more frequent in the HPV16-infected cervical cancer specimens than the HPV16-negative specimens. In contrast, the expression of S6 kinase was similar in both HPV16-positive and -negative samples. The phosphorylation of Akt, the key regulator of S6 kinase, was also detected. Our analysis showed that Akt phosphorylation was unaffected by HPV16 infection. These results together with our previous study suggest that HPV16 modifies S6 kinase activation via mechanism, which activates S6 kinase downstream of Akt function.","title":"Increased phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase is associated with HPV16 infection in cervical cancer and esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"17622239"}
