A 28-year-old woman was hospitalized for generalized convulsion. CT scan and right carotid angiogram revealed AVM in the right parietal lobe extending to the wall of the lateral ventricle. At the time of surgery an intraventricular meningioma attached to the choroid plexus was found in the excised cavity of the AVM. It is suggested that the meningioma might have been caused by chronic irritation due to an increased blood flow in the arteries supplying the AVM, because the AVM and the meningioma exist in the same lesion and share the same blood supply.","title":"[Arteriovenous malformation associated with meningioma].","pubmedId":"2028112"}
