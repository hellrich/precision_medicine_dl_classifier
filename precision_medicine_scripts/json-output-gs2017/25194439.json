HER family tyrosine kinases play a critical role in the development of gastric cancer. The HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases includes EGF receptor (EGFR), HER2, HER3, and HER4. Targeted drugs antineoplastic therapies such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have application with confrontation of gastric cancer. However, less attention has been paid to the oncogenic functions of HER3 essepecially in the gastric cancer due to its lack of intrinsic kinase activity. Recent work, however, has placed the role of HER3 in gastric cancer in the spotlight as a key signaling hub in several contexts. First, HER3 overexpression may be associated with poor prognosis and unfavorable survival mediated by PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Second, a large amount of direct evidence has emerged the benefit of anti-HER3 agents in combination with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as anti-HER2 agents in gastric cancer. Furthermore, we can further elucidate the relationship between HER3 and MET inhibitors in gastric cancer that the development of resistance to MET inhibitors may result from the overexpression of HER3. This review focuses on the current achievements of the relationship between HER3 and gastric cancer in vivo and in vitro, the development of HER3 molecule-targeted therapy, additionally, the challenge which we will meet in the future.
