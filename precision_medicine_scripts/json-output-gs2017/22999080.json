We report the case of an adenocarcinoma of the lung associated with metachronous miliary brain and lung metastases with an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) gene translocation. The patient was treated with crizotinib and showed a twelve-month progression-free survival. Clinicians should be attentive of the evolution of brain metastases with patients presenting EML4-ALK translocation.","title":"Adenocarcinoma of the lung with miliary brain and pulmonary metastases with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation treated with crizotinib: a case report.","pubmedId":"22999080"}
