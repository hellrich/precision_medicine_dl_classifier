The expression of VEGF and PTEN was examined by immunohistochemical method. Correlation analysis was performed with SPSS13.0 software package.\nThe positive rate of PTEN in control group was significantly higher than other groups (P\u003c0.05). The expression of VEGF in poorly differentiated group was significantly higher than other groups (P\u003c0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the expression of VEGF was positively correlated to recurrence and lymph node metastasis (P\u003c0.05); PTEN was negatively correlated to recurrence and lymph node metastasis (P\u003c0.05); VEGF and PTEN in gingival carcinoma was negatively correlated (P\u003c0.05).\nThe increased expression of VEGF and decreased expression of PTEN in gingival carcinoma may play a mutual role in the development of gingival cancer.","title":"[Correlation analysis of VEGF and PTEN expression in gingival carcinoma].","pubmedId":"25543611"}
