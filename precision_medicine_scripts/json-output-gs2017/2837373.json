Evidence has shown that cervical cancer is preceded by dysplastic, or precancerous, lesions. HSV-II has been associated with this process of cervical carcinogenesis. We collected 167 cervical smears that had been diagnosed as normal, dysplastic, or carcinoma-in-situ and found a significantly high positivity of HSV-II antigen in women with cervical dysplasia (38.8%) and carcinoma-in-situ (33.3%) versus women with normal cytology (17.02%). Latent HSV-II infection of cervical epithelium may be considered of prognostic value to identify a population at high risk for cervical cancer.","title":"Immunocytological demonstration of HSV-II antigen on exfoliated cells from precancerous and cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix.","pubmedId":"2837373"}
