K-ras point mutation was detected by PCR-RFLP while p53 mutation was detected by PCR-SSCP.\nK-ras mutation was found in pancreatic juice in 87.8% (36/41) of pancreatic cancer patients and 23.5% (4/17) of benign pancreatic disease patients. In 261 stool specimens, amplification found mutations successfully in 235 patients (90%). K-ras mutation was found in stool in 88% (66/75) of pancreatic cancer patients, 51.1% (24/47) of benign pancreatic disease patients and 19.6% (9/46) of normal individuals. p53 mutation was found in pancreatic juice in 47.4% (18/38) of pancreatic cancer patients and 12.5% (2/16) of benign pancreatic disease patients. p53 mutation was found in stool in 37.1% (23/62) and 19.1% (4/21) of chronic pancreatitis patients.\nK-ras mutation in pancreatic juice has higher diagnosis sensitivity and specificity, and therefore may be used as a supplement in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Detection of K-ras mutation combined with p53 mutation in stool can aid in the screening of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Detecting K-ras and p53 gene mutation from stool and pancreatic juice for diagnosis of early pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"12609076"}
