Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) is the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor. The latter is a hepatotropic factor originally identified in rat serum and platelets. It is essential in fetal tissue development, where it regulates complex morphogenetic processes including extracellular matrix invasion, cell migration, cell polarization and tubulogenesis. The c-Met/HGF system is believed to participate in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during development. Twelve human embryonic minor salivary glands were studied by immunohistochemistry to investigate the role of c-Met in human salivary gland development. Strong c-Met immunopositivity in the glands demonstrated that the molecule is involved in their development and suggested a role for the c-Met/HGF system in this process.","title":"Hepatocyte growth factor receptor, c-Met, in human embryo salivary glands.
