We report here the frequency, distribution and clinical characteristics of the patients (pts) found to have MET alterations in a molecular screening trial. Methods: InMOSCATO clinical trial, pts with locally advanced or metastatic solid cancers had an on-purpose tumor biopsy to perform a comprehensive molecular characterization. Results: Among the 844 adult pts who had a successful molecular portrait, 29 (3.4%) had MET aberrations distributed as follows: 18 had abnormalities at the genomic analysis level while 11 had exclusively expression of phosporylated-MET by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or a positive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Only one of the 74 pediatric pts included had a missense mutation. According to the primary tumor, MET alterations were found in 13/170 successfully biopsied pts with lung cancer, 8/197 with digestive tumors, 3/158 with genito-urinary tumors, 2/83 with gynecologic tumors, 2/111 with head and neck cancers, 1/135 with breast cancer and 1 pt with pediatric glioblastoma. Pathogenic variants (PV) were detected in 3 pts by targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), 2 of these PV were exon 14 donor splice site mutations detected also by whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 2 lung tumors. Missense mutations were identified in 3 pts by RNA-sequencing and in one patient by WES. 8 pts had MET amplification identified by comparative genomic hybridization array (CGH) in 5 cases, by FISH in one case and by both FISH and CGH in 2 cases. One patient displayed both amplification and a missense mutation. Ten pts received an anti-MET targeted therapy. One had PV on NGS and missense mutation on WES, 3 had amplification on CGH or FISH and 6 positive IHC. One patient displaying MET exon 14 donor splice site mutation was treated with crizotinib achieving a rapid and sustained partial response. The other 9 pts were treated with SAR125844, a selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in TED11449 trial (NCT01391533). Conclusions: In this analysis, we saw that MET aberrations are rare in various types of advanced cancers. In selected patients, targeting MET is of clinical interest.
