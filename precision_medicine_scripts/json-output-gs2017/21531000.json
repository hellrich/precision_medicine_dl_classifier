However, the correlation between hepatocyte growth factor or c-Met expression and lymphangiogenesis in human spontaneous tumors has been rarely reported, and the distribution pattern of c-Met on tumor-related lymphatic vessels remains to be further investigated. Lymphatic vessel density, lymphatic invasion, the expression of hepatocyte growth factor, c-Met, and vascular endothelial growth factor C proteins were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 76 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. The distribution of c-Met on lymphatic endothelium was examined. High expression of c-Met in tumor cells was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage (P \u003d .045), high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (P \u003c .001), higher peritumoral lymphatic vessel density (P \u003d .003), higher incidence of peritumoral lymphatic invasion (P \u003d .032), and positive lymph node status (P \u003d .005), in spite of its negative expression on most lymphatic vessels. Patients with high-c-Met expression tumors exhibited shorter overall survival and disease-free survival (P \u003c .001 and P \u003d .010, respectively). Taken together, our results provide indirect evidence for an association and possible regulatory link of c-Met with the lymphangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor C, and, by extension, with lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis, suggesting important prognostic significance of c-Met for patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.","title":"Intratumoral c-Met expression is associated with vascular endothelial growth factor C expression, lymphangiogenesis, and lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma: implications for use as a prognostic marker.","pubmedId":"21531000"}
