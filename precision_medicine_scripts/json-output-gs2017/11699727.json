There are few data about c-myc DNA amplification in histological types of lung cancer other than small cell carcinoma. Therefore the present study was conducted to investigate c-myc oncogene amplification in non-small cell lung carcinoma. We studied 46 lung tumor specimens for c-myc DNA amplification (15 adenocarcinomas, 15 squamous cell carcinomas, 6 large cell carcinomas, and 10 small cell carcinomas). Polymerase chain reaction, digoxigenin DNA labeling, and electrophoresis were utilized to investigate the c-myc copy number in the lung tumor specimens. The c-myc copy number of non-small cell carcinoma ranged from 1.5 to more than 20.0 in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and from 6.0 to 12.0 in large cell carcinoma. That of small cell carcinoma ranged from 1.8 to 12.0. The c-myc copy number of non-small cell carcinoma was significantly higher than that of small cell carcinoma (Wilcoxon rank sum test, Z\u003d2.06 P\u003d0.040). However, the differences in c-myc copy number among these four histological types were not statistically significant. Amplification of c-myc (more than 4 copies) was observed not only in small cell carcinoma but also in nonsmall cell carcinoma at similarly high frequency (12/15 in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, 6/6 in large cell carcinoma, and 9/10 in small cell carcinoma).","title":"Analysis of c-myc DNA amplification in non-small cell lung carcinoma in comparison with small cell lung carcinoma using polymerase chain reaction.","pubmedId":"11699727"}
