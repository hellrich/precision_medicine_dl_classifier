Activation of the MET signaling pathway can occur via different mechanisms. A number of compounds targeting MET have been evaluated in clinical trials, and recent clinical data have begun to afford some insight into the tumor types and patient populations that might benefit from treatment with MET pathway inhibitors.\nWe review recent publications and information disclosed at public conferences and summarize the epidemiology of dysregulation of MET signaling, and the associations thereof with other driver genes and therapeutic inhibitors useful to treat NSCLC.\nThe MET pathway is emerging as a target for advanced NSCLC that is either resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors or that arises de novo. MET inhibitors currently being evaluated in clinical trials have yielded compelling evidence of clinical activities when used to treat various solid tumors, especially NSCLC. Remaining challenges are the identification of patient populations who might benefit from the use of MET inhibitors, and the most effective diagnostic methods for such patients.","title":"Targeting the MET pathway for potential treatment of NSCLC.","pubmedId":"25532429"}
