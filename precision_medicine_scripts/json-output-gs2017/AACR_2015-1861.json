Estrogen receptor  (ER) is the predominant ER isoform in lung cancer and we have previously shown that high cytoplasmic ER combined with low progesterone receptor (PR) expression is a poor prognostic marker for NSCLC patients. To further elucidate the biological differences between ER high/PR low versus ER low/PR high expressing lung tumors, a mRNA microarray analysis using the Illumina HT-12 V4 Bead Chip platform was performed using RNA extracted from 64 cases. 165 genes were differentially expressed between these two groups at P\u003c001. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) was a highly over-expressed gene associated with ER high tumors (2.1-fold, P\u003c0.004), while the decoy receptor for FGFR ligands, fibroblast growth factor receptor like-1 (FGFR5), was down-regulated (0.54-fold, P\u003c0.0001). Ingenuity Pathway analysis revealed a network among the 165 differentially expressed genes that linked FGFR1 and FGFR5 to the ER. To analyze cross-talk between the FGF and E2 pathways, we determined the FGF/FGFR profile in a panel of three FGFR1 amplified and five non-amplified NSCLC cell lines. FGF2, 3, 10, and 19 were the most highly secreted FGFs in the cell line panel. FGFR1 amplified cells secreted statistically more FGF3, 6 and 10 compared to non-amplified cells. -estradiol (E2) induced secretion of FGF2 in a cell line without FGFR1 amplification. FGFR3 and 5 were ubiquitously expressed across all cell lines while FGFR1, 2 and 4 expression was higher in amplified cell lines. There was no relationship between ER protein expression and FGFR1 amplification status or FGFR1-5 protein expression. Because FGF signaling has been shown to increase stem cell-like phenotypes in breast cancer, we determined basal and E2-stimulated expression of the stem cell markers, SOX2 and OCT4. Basal SOX2 and OCT4 were more highly expressed in FGFR1 amplified cells compared to non-amplified cells. SOX2 and OCT4 protein expression were increased by E2 treatment in FGFR1 non-amplified cells, with lesser effects in FGFR1 amplified H520 cells. SOX2 expression was also down-regulated in lung sections from mice treated with a combination of the anti-estrogen fulvestrant and the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. Finally, we have shown that in FGFR1 non-amplified cells, the anti-proliferative effect of a pan-FGFR inhibitor, AZD4547, can be enhanced in the presence of the anti-estrogen fulvestrant. These results suggest that there is an interaction between the estrogen and FGF signaling pathways in lung cancer and provides a rationale for combination treatment of NSCLC tumors. Further characterization of the molecular types of NSCLC that will benefit from joint therapy is warranted.
