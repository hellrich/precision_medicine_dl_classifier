The patient exhibited HIV seropositivity stage B1, the immune-virology of which was well controlled by antiretroviral tritherapy.\nThe relationship between cancer and HIV has been established for certain cancers such as Hodgkin\u0027s disease, non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma, Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma and invasive cancers of the uterine neck in women. The significant increase in some cancers in patients infected by HIV (lung, penis, soft tissue, lips, seminoma) suggests the potential association with immunodepression unless it corresponds to a risk induced by antiretroviral treatments in the long term.","title":"[Metastatic cancer of the prostate in a 40-year-old HIV-infected male patient].","pubmedId":"12714903"}
