Mutation analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 by SSCP was conducted on the 113 breast cancer patients (probands) with at least 1 breast cancer (site-specific breast cancer families, n \u003d 101) or 1 ovarian cancer (breast/ovarian cancer families, n \u003d 12) patient in their first-degree relatives. Fifteen deleterious mutations (13.3%), including 8 nonsense and 7 frameshift mutations, were identified in BRCA1, and 21 deleterious mutations (18.6%), including 8 nonsense, 12 frameshift and 1 splice-site mutations, were identified in BRCA2. In site-specific breast cancer families, mutation frequency of BRCA1 or BRCA2 was high in families with 3 or more breast cancer patients (36%, 9/25), early onset (40 \u003c or \u003d years old) breast cancer patients (38%, 19/50) or bilateral breast cancer patients (40%, 6/15). In breast/ovarian cancer families, mutations of BRCA1 (58.3%, n \u003d 7), but not BRCA2 (0%, n \u003d 0), were observed. BRCA1 codon 63 (TTA to TAA) nonsense mutation and BRCA2 frameshift mutation (5802 del AATT) were observed in 4 and 7 independent families, respectively. Haplotype analysis has suggested that carriers of each of these mutations have common ancestors. These results demonstrate that family profiles are important determinants of risk for carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and that cumulative frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Japanese breast cancer families (31.9%) is within the range observed in Caucasian breast cancer families. Presence of Japanese founder mutations has also been suggested.","title":"Frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in Japanese breast cancer families.","pubmedId":"11149425"}
