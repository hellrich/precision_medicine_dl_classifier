A long term, 12 years survivor of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma arising in a local dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct is presented. A 40-year-old male patient was presented with recurrent upper abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice. Computed tomography revealed a localized duct dilatation, and ultrasound clearly demonstrated a tumor mass arising within the bile duct. At surgery in March, 1982, the tumor mass was resected and histologically confirmed as a well differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma arising. In March, 1994, the patient is alive and cancer-free, 12 years after surgical resection. To our knowledge, there has been no report on a patient surviving more than 10 years after initial treatment. This case suggests that a localized cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic-bile duct on imaging modalities may harbor a bile duct carcinoma, and this in turn may contribute to early diagnosis of carcinomas and improved long term survival.","title":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with a long-term survival of 12 years after surgical resection: report of a case and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"8751206"}
