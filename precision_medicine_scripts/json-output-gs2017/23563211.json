Patients with LD SCLC treated with EP or EC and concurrent or sequential radiotherapy and those with ED SCLC treated with EP or EC were included for analysis. A retrospective review examining prognostic features and outcomes was performed. OS and LRC curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test.\nA total of 249 patients with LD SCLC and 287 patients with ED SCLC were identified. Patients treated with EC were significantly older for both LD (median 62 vs. 72, P\u003c0.001) and ED (median 62 vs. 73, P\u003c0.001). Median follow-up times were 37 and 22 months for LD and ED SCLC, respectively. Median OS for EP and EC in LD SCLC patients were 23 and 18 months (P\u003d0.10). LRC rates at 12 months were 81% for the EP group and 68% for the EC group (P\u003d0.97). Median OS for the EP and EC patients with ED SCLC was 10 and 11 months, respectively, (P\u003d0.24).\nDespite the preferential use of EC in an older population, median OS and LRC rates were not significantly different for patients treated with EP for both LD and ED SCLC.","title":"Outcomes of small cell lung cancer patients treated with cisplatin-etoposide versus carboplatin-etoposide.","pubmedId":"23563211"}
