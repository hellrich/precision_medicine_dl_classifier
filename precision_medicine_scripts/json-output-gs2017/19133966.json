Adolescents with childhood-onset BP had the longest illness, followed by children and then adolescents with adolescent-onset BP. Adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, and duration of illness, while manic, both adolescent groups showed more \u0027typical\u0027 and severe manic symptoms. Mood lability was more frequent in childhood-onset and adolescents with early-onset BP. While depressed, both adolescent groups showed more severe depressive symptoms, higher rates of melancholic and atypical symptoms, and suicide attempts than children. Depressed children had more severe irritability than depressed adolescents. Early BP onset was associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, whereas later BP onset was associated with panic, conduct, and substance use disorders. Above-noted results were similar when each BP subtype was analyzed separately.\nOlder age was associated with more severe and typical mood symptomatology. However, there were differences and similarities in type, intensity, and frequency of BP symptoms and comorbid disorders related to age of onset and duration of BP and level of psychosocial development. These factors and the normal difficulties youth have expressing and modulating their emotions may explain existing complexities in diagnosing and treating BP in youth, particular in young children, and suggest the need for developmentally sensitive treatments.","title":"Comparison of manic and depressive symptoms between children and adolescents with bipolar spectrum disorders.","pubmedId":"19133966"}
