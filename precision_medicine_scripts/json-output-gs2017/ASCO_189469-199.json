However, some patients show early progression (EP) in first-line EGFR-TKI treatment, and their prognosis is still unclear. This study aimed to examine the implications of EP for prognosis of EGFR mutant NSCLC patients. Methods: Advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib (GEF) as first-line between 2005 and 2015 at Shizuoka Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed. EP on GEF was defined as disease progression before 180 days according to the Jackman criteria. Results: Forty-five of 198 patients treated with GEF as first-line, showed EP. Patient characteristics was as follows (with EP/ without EP) : median age (range), 69 (32-88)/ 70 (35-92) years; male, 40/ 28%; ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1, 64/ 79%; deletion in exon 19 (del 19), 36/ 53%; L858R in exon 21, 53/ 43%; never smoker, 44/ 65%; liver metastasis, 27/ 12%; brain metastasis, 44/ 37%. The median overall survival was 395 days (95% CI: 267-547 days) for patients with EP and 979 days (95% CI: 808-1124 days) for those without EP. Post progression survival after treatment with GEF was significantly shorter in patients with EP (median: 254 days vs. 420 days, HR: 0.55 (95% CI: 0.39-0.79), P \u003c 0.05). Among patients with EP, 56% received subsequent chemotherapy (patients without EP: 71%). In univariate analysis, EP was significantly associated with four factors; liver metastasis, smoking history, PS 2-4, absence of del 19. In multivariate analysis, smoking history (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.18-0.80), PS 2-4 (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.19-0.98), and del 19 (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.04-4.45) were significantly correlated (P \u003c 0.05) with EP. Conclusions: Patients with EP during first-line GEF therapy for advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC showed poor prognosis. Since smokers, patients with PS 2-4, or absence of del 19 tend to show EP, improving first-line treatment is necessary to improve their prognosis.","title":"Impact of early progression on prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation.","pubmedId":"ASCO_189469-199"}
