We studied 100 patients and consisted of 50 cases with conventional adenocarcinoma and 50 cases with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (32 nonmucinous and 18 mucinous subtypes). Representative sections were immunostained for HER2/neu, p53, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Positivity was scored quantitatively by three observers and correlated with multiple prognostic parameters including survival. In the conventional adenocarcinoma, HER2/neu, p53, and vascular endothelial growth factor were expressed in 19/50 (38%), 32/50 (64%), 33/50 (66%), respectively. In this group, p53 showed a significant correlation with recurrence while vascular endothelial growth factor correlated with angiolymphatic invasion (P \u003c 0.05). HER2/neu, p53, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression was associated with significantly shorter survival (log rank, P \u003c 0.05). Patient whose tumors coexpressed both p53 and HER2/neu had the worst outcome. In the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, HER2/neu, p53, and vascular endothelial growth factor were expressed in 9/50 (18%), 3/50 (6%) and 12/50 (24%), respectively which was significantly less than in conventional adenocarcinoma (P \u003c 0.05). HER2/neu positivity showed a significant correlation with shorter survival (log rank, P \u003c 0.05) in nonmucinous type. In conclusion, vascular endothelial growth factor was associated with angiolymphatic invasion and poor prognosis in conventional adenocarcinoma. Also, in conventional adenocarcinoma, p53, and HER2/neu expression appeared to be poor prognostic markers, while in bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, only HER2/neu was associated with a poorer prognosis. This immunostaining pattern suggests that conventional adenocarcinoma has different molecular abnormalities than bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.","title":"Prognostic significance of HER2/neu, p53, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in early stage conventional adenocarcinoma and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"15167937"}
