Despite this, over 96% of patients undergoing hereditary cancer multi-gene panel testing (MGPT) are women. Prostate cancer (PC) is associated with mutations in CHEK2, ATM, BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA),and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations for early screening exist for mutation carriers. We sought to describe the mutation spectrum and MGPT uptake in men with PC as compared to women with breast cancer (BC). Methods: Test results were reviewed for PC patients undergoing MGPT (Jun 2013  Sep 2015) for BRCA and 3-47 other genes. Clinical history was obtained from ordering providers. Results: 14.2% (51/360) of PC probands carried at least one mutation across 14 genes, compared to 7.9% of women with BC (p \u003d 7.076E-5; 95% CI 1.40 - 2.62). BRCA mutations made up 39% of PC positives (20/51). BRCA2 mutations accounted for 29% of positives and were found in 4.1% of PC probands. Consistent with findings among women with BC, other commonly mutated genes included ATM (2.5%) and CHEK2(1.9%). The median age at PC diagnosis was 60 for mutation-positive and negative men. The median time from PC diagnosis to MGPT was 6 years, compared to 1 year for female BC. 92% of mutation-positive men met NCCN hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) criteria at the time of testing. Over 68% (35/51) of positives had multiple primary cancers, with PC followed by a related cancer in 85.7% (30/35). Of these, 86% (26/30) met NCCN HBOC criteria at their PC diagnosis, as 46/51 had relevant family history, yet testing was not initiated until another HBOC cancer developed. Conclusions: In this cohort of men with PC, MGPT identified mutations in hereditary cancer genes at rates higher than females with BC undergoing the same panels. Although PC plus a family history of HBOC-related cancer meets NCCN criteria for testing, most MGPT-positive men were not tested until developing a subsequent HBOC cancer. Revisions to NCCN guidelines (2012-present) do increasingly recognize the contribution of PC to risk for HBOC; however, increased awareness among clinicians is needed to identify otherwise unrecognized male mutation carriers.","title":"Gender bias: Underdiagnosing hereditary cancer in men with prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_171179-176"}
