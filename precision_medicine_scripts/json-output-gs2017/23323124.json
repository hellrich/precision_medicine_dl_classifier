Considering the increase in cases of PDA discovered incidentally on echocardiograms at young ages, and the life-shortening effect of PDA, it is rare to diagnose PDA in old patients. We report a case of an 80-year-old patient who experienced symptoms of congestive heart failure showed findings suggestive of PDA in echocardiogram and confirmed the diagnosis through a cardiac catheterization and a coronary angiography. After percutaneous occlusion of PDA with an Amplatzer duct occlusion device, symptoms related to congestive heart failure improved.","title":"A case of patent ductus arteriosus with congestive heart failure in a 80-year-old man.","pubmedId":"23323124"}
