The amplification products were studied with conventional electrophoresis using acrylamide gels and stained with ethidium bromide to detect the mutations.\nIn 23 of 25 frozen pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens, Ki-ras genes with mutations at codon 12 were found; 2 mutant styles were found in 8 of the 23 samples; no mutations were found in 11 normal pancreatic tissues, 12 benign pancreatic disease tissues and 3 bile duct carcinoma tissues. This method is rapid, convenient, specific as well as sensitive. We conclude that this may become a valuable diagnostic modality for pancreatic carcinoma and for differentiating benign pancreatic diseases from carcinoma.","title":"[Rapid and simple detection of Ki-ras gene mutations in pancreatic adenocarcinoma by PCR-SSP].","pubmedId":"9388877"}
