SAM-e may be a treatment alternative for the management of depression in a population reluctant to add another \"pill\" or another set of related side effects to an already complex highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen.\nThe Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to assess depressive symptomatology from 1,2,4,6 and 8 weeks after initiation of treatment with SAM-e.\nData show a significant acute reduction in depressive symptomatology, as measured by both the HAM-D and the BDI instruments.\nSAM-e has a rapid effect evident as soon as week 1 (p \u003c .001), with progressive decreases in depression symptom rating scores throughout the 8 week study.","title":"S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) for the treatment of depression in people living with HIV/AIDS.","pubmedId":"15538952"}
