However, serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels were found to correlate significantly with clinical severity of atopic dermatitis and chronic renal failure. The present study was conducted in patients with human papillomavirus 16 DNA-positive uterine cervical cancer to determine the plasma level of human papillomavirus 16 DNA and the diagnostic values of plasma human papillomavirus DNA in these patients.\nForty-three human papillomavirus 16-positive patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma were recruited in this study. The diagnosis was cervical cancer in 20 patients, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in 21, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in 1 and negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy in 3 patients. Before any treatment, blood samples were collected from all patients. For analysis of human papillomavirus DNA in plasma of patients with cervical cancer, quantitative polymerase chain reaction fluorescent assay for human papillomavirus 16 was performed using human papillomavirus 16 primers and SYBR Green dye using the LightCycler 480 SW1.5 apparatus.\nPlasma human papillomavirus 16 DNA was detected in only 30.0% of the patients with human papillomavirus 16-positive cervical cancer and in none of normal controls. The copy number of plasma human papillomavirus 16 DNA was higher in patients with invasive cancer than in those with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3), micro-invasive cancer and in normal individuals.\nThese results indicated that the plasma human papillomavirus DNA level could be potentially used as a marker of low-invasive cervical cancer tumors in patients with normal squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels before treatment.","title":"Human papillomavirus DNA in plasma of patients with HPV16 DNA-positive uterine cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"20133337"}
