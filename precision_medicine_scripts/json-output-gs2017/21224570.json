Case 1: A 71-year-old male patient was diagnosed as pancreatic head cancer by abdominal ultrasound. The tumor size was about 2 cm in diameter. Whipple\u0027s procedure and regional lymphadenectomy were conducted. Pathological diagnosis was pT3N2 with s0 and rp1. Gemcitabine (GEM) was administered in a routine fashion at out-patient clinic. He is free of disease after three years and eight months. Case 2: A 63-year-old male patient was diagnosed as pancreatic head cancer although the mass was not so clearly visible by CT. Pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed with D2 lymph node dissection. Pathological report was pT3N1 with s0 and rp0. GEM was started six months after the operation but continued for only six months. After the non-treatment interval of six months, GEM was restarted due to the sudden elevation of CA19-9. Soon the number dropped but instead of reaching normal range, it began to increase again. S-1 was added to the regimen which gave a great response. He is well after three and a half years. CA19-9 was almost being normal. Both patients had cancer within the pancreas without an invasion to the surrounding tissue. GEM is a standard regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy. However, S-1 may contribute to the outcome when GEM becomes powerless.","title":"[Two cases of pancreatic cancer with fairly good prognosis].","pubmedId":"21224570"}
