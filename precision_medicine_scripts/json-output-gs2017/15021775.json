Sixty-three subjects (108 ears) with audiology data at either short-term follow-up (7 mo-2 yr) or long-term follow-up (3-5 yr) after diagnosis were examined in this study.\nChanges in four-frequency pure-tone average and speech discrimination score before any treatment intervention for both follow-up intervals.\nWithin 2 years of the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis Type 2, 27% of the ears experienced a significant loss in pure-tone average relative to diagnosis, and 73% of the ears experienced no significant change in hearing.\nNewly diagnosed neurofibromatosis Type 2 patients who do not require immediate treatment of both vestibular schwannomas are likely to have stable hearing in the unoperated ear(s) for approximately 1 to 2 years.","title":"Hearing changes after diagnosis in neurofibromatosis type 2.","pubmedId":"15021775"}
