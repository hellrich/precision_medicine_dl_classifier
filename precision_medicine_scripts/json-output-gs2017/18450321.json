However, further molecular characterization of tumor cells carrying EGFR mutations (EGFR-mut) is warranted.\nBy DNA sequencing, 120 patients with lung adenocarcinomas (70 tumors with BAC components) were screened for EGFR mutations within exons 18-21. Performing comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and immunohistochemistry, chromosomal imbalances and protein expression levels of EGFR, ErbB3 and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) were analyzed, respectively.\nEGFR mutations were detected in 20/120 tumors. Tumors with BAC components carried more frequently EGFR mutations compared to adenocarcinomas without BAC histology (17/70\u003d24% vs 3/50\u003d6.0%; p\u003d0.012). In a subsequent matched-pair analysis, CGH-analysis demonstrated similar mean numbers of chromosomal imbalances for EGFR mutated and wild-type tumors (8.6 vs 7.8 gains; 2.4 vs 2.7 losses), respectively. Furthermore, tumors with mutated EGFR demonstrated gains in chromosomes 7p, 16p and 20q and losses in chromosome 8p. Interestingly, EGFR mutated tumors showed higher VEGF expression (p\u003d0.03) while differences in EGFR expression were not statistically significant.\nEGFR gene mutations are frequently seen in lung adenocarcinomas with BAC differentiation and can be linked to chromosomal imbalances and increased VEGF expression.","title":"Correlation of EGFR mutations with chromosomal alterations and expression of EGFR, ErbB3 and VEGF in tumor samples of lung adenocarcinoma patients.","pubmedId":"18450321"}
