Preclinical data suggested that HER3 overexpression increases sensitivity to TKIs. A total of 82 NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib (250 mg), and previously evaluated for EGFR and HER2 status by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and DNA sequencing, and for Phospho-Akt status by immunohistochemistry, were investigated for HER3 genomic gain by FISH. Patients with high polysomy and gene amplification were considered as HER3 FISH positive (+). HER3 FISH+ pattern was significantly associated with female gender (P\u003d0.02) and never smoking history (P\u003d0.02). Patients with HER3+ tumours (26.8%) had a significantly longer time to progression (3.7 vs 2.7, P\u003d0.04) than patients with HER3- tumours, but not a significantly better response rate or survival. Patients with EGFR+/HER3+ tumours had higher objective response rate (36.4 vs 9.9%, P\u003d0.03) and time to progression (7.7 vs 2.7 months, P\u003d0.03) than patients with EGFR- and/or HER3- tumours, but no significantly longer survival. No difference in response was observed according to HER3 status in patients with EGFR+ tumours. Patients with HER2+/HER3+ tumours had similar outcome as patients with HER2- and/or HER3- tumours. Significantly different clinical end points were not observed between patients with HER3+/P-Akt+ and HER3- and/or P-Akt- tumours. Genomic gain for HER3 is not a marker for response or resistance to TKI therapy in advanced NSCLC patients.","title":"HER3 genomic gain and sensitivity to gefitinib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"16288303"}
