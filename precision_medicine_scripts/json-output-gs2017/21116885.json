During his hospital stay for a sudden hypovolemic shock, the patient underwent an urgent laparotomy and a 20 cm Ã— 15 cm ruptured ileal GIST causing haemoperitoneum was found. Only 13 cases of ileal GIST causing peritoneal bleeding have been described since 2000, the one we presented is the largest. Although rare this pathological entity should be kept in mind in case of sudden abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock in patients with a large intraabdominal mass.","title":"Giant ileal gastrointestinal stromal tumour presenting as an intestinal subocclusion and subsequent haemoperitoneum: a case report and a review of the literature.","pubmedId":"21116885"}
