When compared to adults, intraventricular location of childhood meningiomas is four to ten times as high. Atypical pathology of these lesions is very uncommon and indicates an aggressive nature. They are usually associated with Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) or previous cranial irradiation. Here, we present an interesting case of an unusually large, congenital intraventricular meningioma of atypical pathology in a 16 month old child with subsequently diagnosed NF2. A brief review of literature is also presented with this case illustration.","title":"16 month-old female with intraventricular mass.","pubmedId":"21492294"}
