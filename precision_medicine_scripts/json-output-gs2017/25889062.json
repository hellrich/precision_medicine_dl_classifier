She was treated with crizotinib as second-line chemotherapy. The clinical stage after crizotinib treatment was ycT2aN0M0, stage IB. We performed a left lower lobectomy and lymph node dissection aimed at local control and pathological confirmation of the remaining tumor. The final pathological stage was ypT2aN2M0, stage IIIA with Ef 1b. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of surgical resection in ALK rearrangement-positive lung adenocarcinoma after crizotinib treatment.
