If such a detrimental effect is preserved in each stage of advanced (stage II or III) CRC, we can identify high-risk patients.\nWe enrolled 641 patients with pathologically confirmed advanced CRC (stage II, n \u003d 207; stage III, n \u003d 434) who had undergone curative resection of the primary lesion. The association of preoperative obstruction with clinicopathologic parameters was evaluated. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the effect of preoperative obstruction on disease-free survival in each stage.\nPreoperative obstruction was seen in 63 patients (9.8%) (stage II, n \u003d 16; stage III, n \u003d 47). Multivariable analysis showed that preoperative obstruction was significantly associated with preoperative elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen level in patients with colon cancer (odds ratio \u003d 3.59; P \u003c 0.001), while it was correlated with poor differentiation in patients with rectal cancer (odds ratio \u003d 3.99; P \u003d 0.016). Preoperative obstruction was a significant prognostic factor in stage III CRC (P \u003c 0.001), but not in stage II disease. Multivariable prognostic analysis showed that preoperative obstruction was a remnant independent prognostic factor in stage III CRC. This finding was confirmed by separate analyses of colon and rectal cancer. Preoperative obstruction was associated with systemic recurrence (P \u003d 0.003) rather than peritoneal or local recurrence.\nThese findings suggest that preoperative obstruction may predict worse long-term prognosis in patients with stage III CRC and may be a potential clinical marker to identify patients with high-risk stage III CRC.","title":"Prognostic significance of preoperative bowel obstruction in stage III colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"21369738"}
