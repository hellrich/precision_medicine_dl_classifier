Methods:    The protocol received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval in 7/2007. The first patient was enrolled in 4/2010. The accrual target was 66 patients to test if the Serious Adverse Event (SAE) ratecould be reduced from 15% (expected) to less than 5%. Protocol therapy consisted of proton therapy to a planning target volume (PTV) dose of 59.4 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) at 1.8CGE per fraction with concomitant oral Capecitabine (1000mg PO BID 5 days/week on radiation treatment days). Only gross disease was targeted.  Results:    12 patients were enrolled. 1 patient died of a gunshot wound 5 days after starting treatment so only 11 patients are reported. Median follow up from start of treatment: 13 months (range 2 to 21 months). Median age: 68 (range 51 to 86) years. Gender: Males 5, Females 6. Race/Ethnicity: 9 White, 2 Hispanic. Overall survival: 90% at 6 months and 60% at 12 months. Freedom from progression: 80% at 6 months and 53% at one year. Local control: 100% at 6 months and 86% at 12 months. Freedom from metastasis: 80% at 6 months and 67% at 12 months.No patient experienced any grade 3 or greater toxicity during treatment or the follow up period. Grade 2 toxicity was limited to a single patient experiencing grade 2 fatigue. Median weight loss over the course of treatment was 1.7 (range: loss of 5.7 to gain of 4.9) Kg. 4 patients were deemed to have had an adequate radiographic response to radiotherapy so as to justify surgical exploration.  Conclusions:   Proton therapy to 59.4 CGE with concomitant Capecitabine was well tolerated with no grade 2 or greater gastrointestinal toxicities.  4 of 11 patients achieved a radiographic response allowing for attempted surgical resection. The study was closed to accrual on 9/1/2013 due to recognition that slow accrual made achievement of the primary study endpoint unlikely. At the same time, the lack of any meaningful gastrointestinal toxicity suggests significant opportunities for treatment intensification when proton therapy is used in this setting.
