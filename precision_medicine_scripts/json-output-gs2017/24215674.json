Currently, there are no effective targeted therapies for this genetically defined subset of cancers harboring oncogenic K-Ras mutations that confer drug resistance, aggressive tumor growth, metastasis and poor clinical outcome. We identified a novel synthetic oleanane triterpenoid compound designated AMR-MeOAc that effectively kills K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer HPAF-II cells. The cytotoxic effects correlated with apoptosis induction, as was evidenced by increase of apoptosis cells upon the treatment of AMR-MeOAc in HPAF-II cells. Our studies revealed that AMR-MeOAc treatment inhibits cancer associated survival gene survivin. Moreover, AMR-MeOAc also led to down regulation of Akt, ERK1/2 and survivin protein levels. Our results indicate that AMR-MeOAc or its active analogs could be a novel class of anticancer agents against K-Ras driven human pancreatic cancer.
