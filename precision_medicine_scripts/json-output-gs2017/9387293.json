The gene expression was found in 38 of the former and in 9 of the latter tumors. The gene amplification showed significant difference between malignant and benign tumors (P \u003c 0.01). But for gene expression, only the strongly positive staining demonstrated significant difference (P \u003c 0.01). There was correlation between c-erbB2 gene amplification and expression in epithelial ovarian carcionoma. The status of c-erbB2 gene amplification and expression had no relationship with histopathological types of ovarian carcinoma. The results indicate that there is extensive expression of c-erbB2 in epithelial ovarian tumors and it is over-expressed in ovarian carcinoma. Gene amplification is perhaps only one way by which c-erb2 gene is activated, and its overexpression might be one of the factors that promotes epithelial ovarian cancer development.","title":"[Study of the amplification and expression of c-erbB2 oncogene in epithelial ovarian tumors].","pubmedId":"9387293"}
