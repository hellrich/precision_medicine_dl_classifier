Our previous studies have implicated the potential roles of ITLN1 in the aggressiveness of gastric cancer. Herein, we investigated the functions, downstream targets, and clinical significance of ITLN1 in the progression of gastric cancer. We demonstrated that ITLN1 increased the levels of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α), resulting in suppression of nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of β-catenin in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, ITLN1 attenuated the activity of nuclear factor-kappa B, a transcription factor repressing the HNF4α expression, in gastric cancer cells through inactivating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/Ikappa B kinase signaling. Gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that ITLN1 suppressed the growth, invasion, and metastasis of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, restoration of HNF4α expression prevented the gastric cancer cells from ITLN1-mediated changes in these biological features. In clinical gastric cancer tissues, HNF4α expression was positively correlated with that of ITLN1. Patients with high ITLN1 or HNF4α expression had greater survival probability. Taken together, these data indicate that ITLN1 suppresses the progression of gastric cancer through up-regulation of HNF4α, and is associated with improved survival in patients with gastric cancer.","title":"Intelectin 1 suppresses tumor progression and is associated with improved survival in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"25965823"}
