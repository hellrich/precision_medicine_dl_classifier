In the present study we investigated the prognostic significance of mutations to the TP53 tumour suppressor gene in a large, consecutive series of oesophageal adenocarcinomas. The incidence of TP53 mutation determined by molecular analysis of endoscopic biopsy specimens was 36% (49/135). No statistically significant difference was observed in patient survival according to the TP53 status of the tumour biopsy. The median survival time for patients with mutation was 12 +/- 1 months compared with 14 +/- 2 months for patients with TP53. These results demonstrate that mutation of the TP53 gene is not a useful predictive marker for patient survival in oesophageal adenocarcinoma.","title":"TP53 gene mutation status in pretreatment biopsies of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has no prognostic value.","pubmedId":"10674013"}
