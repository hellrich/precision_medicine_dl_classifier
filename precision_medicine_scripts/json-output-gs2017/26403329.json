BRAF V600E mutated thyroid carcinoma cell lines were used to test the activation status of both ERK and AKT kinase proteins through immunofluorescent studies and Western blots.\nExpressions of BRAF V600E mutated protein were confirmed in four thyroid (papillary and undifferentiated) carcinoma cell lines. In these cell lines, both active ERK and active AKT kinase proteins were found in BRAF V600E mutated thyroid carcinoma cells by immunofluorescent staining and Western blots experiments.\nIn BRAF V600E mutated thyroid carcinomas, active ERK and active AKT kinase proteins were noted. They are able to stimulate multiple downstream signalling pathways which ultimately result in increased proliferation and survival activities for cancer cells. Therefore, consideration needs to put on multiple targets when deciding molecular target therapies for patients with BRAF V600E mutated thyroid carcinoma.","title":"Multiple proliferation-survival signalling pathways are simultaneously active in BRAF V600E mutated thyroid carcinomas.","pubmedId":"26403329"}
