Point mutations are evidenced in about 50% of the NF2 patients and large genomic deletions account for approximately 33% of the NF2 gene alterations. To facilitate the deletion screening, 16 polymorphic markers were identified in the NF2 genomic sequence enabling an hemizygosity test in familial studies.","title":"Characterisation of 16 polymorphic markers in the NF2 gene: application to hemizygosity detection.","pubmedId":"10220142"}
