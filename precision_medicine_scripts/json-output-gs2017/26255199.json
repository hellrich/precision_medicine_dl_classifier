One of the key findings has been the heterogeneity of mutational profiles, with no two primary breast tumors being alike. How these genetic alterations will help us manage patients is currently unclear. Studies are ongoing to determine which genetic alterations will signify \"oncogenic addiction\" and which ones will determine resistance and relapse to current standard therapies.","title":"Molecular segmentation of luminal breast: Reality in 2015?","pubmedId":"26255199"}
