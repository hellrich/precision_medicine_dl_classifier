A thoracic CT scan revealed a mass lesion in the right middle lobe. Transcutaneous needle aspiration cytology from the lung tumor and transcutaneous hepatic tumor biopsy were performed, from which the cytohistological diagnosis was small cell lung cancer with liver metastasis. The patient was treated with 3 courses of high dose cisplatin with vindesine and mitomycin and 5 courses of carboplatin with etoposide, and achieved a complete response. We herein report a long-term survivor of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.","title":"[A long-term survivor of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"10660747"}
