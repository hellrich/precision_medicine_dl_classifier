The KRAS mutation is the most commonly detected genetic alteration in IMAs. Recent progress has permitted the identification of novel fusions such as NRG1. In an effort to further discovery of new driver oncogenes, we have carried out whole-transcriptome sequencing of IMA. To exclude IMA cases with known driver oncogenes, we performed targeted sequencing using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel. We also tested other currently known fusion genes in lung cancer including CD74-NRG1, TPM3-ROS1, SDC4-ROS1, SLC34A2-ROS1, CD74-ROS1, EZR-ROS1, LRIG-ROS1, KIF5B-RET, CCDC6-RET1, EZR-ERBB4, TRIM24-BRAF, KIAA1468-RET, EML4-ALK, and KIF5B-ALK using RT-PCR. Finally we found 10 IMA cases without known driver oncogenes and performed transcriptome paired-end sequencing (the Illumina HiSeq platform). We utilized and compared 3 bioinformatic pipelines, FusionMap, deFuse, and ChimeraScan to identify fusion events. Of 10 IMA cases tested, we found 2 novel fusions, PTPRK-FILIP1 and CEP85L-RNGTT, from a never-smoking female patient. They were shared across all three fusion-finder and never reported in TCGA fusion gene data portal. Only PTPRK-FILIP1 was showed an in-frame fusion between exon 2 of PTPRK and 5 UTR of FILIP1. It was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis and Sanger sequencing. This precise fusion was not present in the matched normal tissue. The reading frame is preserved that both the start codon of PTPRK and FILIP1. However, PTPRK mRNA expression is increased until exon 2 because of the fusion includes only two exons of PTPRK. Otherwise, expression analysis showed significant increase of FILIP1 mRNA expression in the affected tumor pair sample. The protein product from FILIP1 is closely associated with the protein filamin A, which is associated with tumor proliferation, cell migration, and metastasis. Many studies have reported that filamin A as a poor prognostic factor. Considering its implication in tumor proliferation, cell migration, and metastasis, PTPRK-FILIP1 could be a novel target for IMA. This is the first report of PTPRK-FILIP1 fusion gene in IMA without known driver mutations. Further functional validation of FILIP1 fusion is planned.","title":"A novel PTPRK-FILIP1 fusion gene in invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma of lung without known driver mutations","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-97"}
