TAE684 inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, but not ERK phosphorylation, and it showed little effect on cell proliferation or apoptosis, in EML4-ALK-positive H2228 cells. The combination of TAE684 and a MEK inhibitor-induced marked apoptosis accompanied by inhibition of STAT3 and ERK pathways in H2228 cells. Such dual interruption of STAT3 and ERK pathways induced downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein survivin and upregulation of the proapoptotic protein BIM.\nOur results indicate that interruption of both STAT3-survivin and ERK-BIM pathways is required for induction of apoptosis in NSCLC harbouring EML4-ALK, providing a rationale for combination therapy with ALK and MEK inhibitors in EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC patients for whom ALK inhibitors alone are ineffective.","title":"Combined effect of ALK and MEK inhibitors in EML4-ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer cells.","pubmedId":"22240786"}
