By virtue of its distinctive genotype (codeletion 1p/19q), oligodendroglioma is a particularly inviting paradigm to test the assumption that such mixed tumors are clonally derived from a glial primary. We observed this constellation in a 41-year-old male who underwent two resection procedures for a recurring right frontal tumor at five years\u0027 interval. On imaging, both lesions were contrast-enhancing, and measured 7 cm × 7 cm × 6.8 cm and 7 cm × 6.5 cm × 4cm, respectively. Following the first operation, temozolomide monotherapy was administered. Whereas initial histology showed conventional anaplastic oligodendroglioma, the recurrence consisted mostly of a fibrosarcoma-like, fascicular neoplasm that was immunoreactive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, S100 protein, and focally epithelial membrane antigen. In between, a subset of otherwise indistinguishable spindle cells expressed GFAP, and focally merged with residues of oligodendroglioma. Molecular testing for loss of heterozygosity confirmed codeletion of 1p/19q in both the primary tumor and the sarcomatous recurrence. Similarly, generalized immunoreactivity for the mutant R132H form of isocitrate dehydrogenase in both lesions indicated an identical mutation of the IDH1 gene. By the above standards, biologically consistent \"oligosarcomas\" are felt to be exceedingly rare, and possibly participate of a nosologically heterogeneous group of combined glial/mesenchymal lesions that may also include iatrogenically induced second malignancies as well as true collision tumors.","title":"Sarcomatous evolution of oligodendroglioma (\"oligosarcoma\"): confirmatory report of an uncommon pattern of malignant progression in oligodendroglial tumors.","pubmedId":"23102810"}
