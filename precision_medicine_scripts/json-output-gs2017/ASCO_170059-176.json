Selinexor is an oral, selective inhibitor of nuclear export that specifically blocks XPO1, leading to the nuclear accumulation and re-activation of tumor suppressor proteins and growth modulators. Selinexor demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in liposarcoma (LPS) cell line and murine models. Sarcoma patients received selinexor in two Phase 1 studies, resulting in stable disease in 14/18 (78%) of patients with advanced LPS; notably, 6 of these had stable disease  4 months. Tumor reduction of 2-23% was noted in 14 patients. There were no clinically significant cumulative toxicities. Hence, we designed a Phase 2/3 multi-center, randomized, double blind study to assess whether selinexor can improve progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced unresectable DDLS compared to placebo. Methods: Eligible patients have DDLS with measurable disease, radiologic evidence of progressive disease (PD) within 6 months, and have had at least one prior line of systemic therapy. Patients with pure WDLS, myxoid/round cell or pleomorphic subtypes are not eligible. Patients will be randomized 1:1 (selinexor:placebo) during Phase 2, and 2:1 during Phase 3 and will receive selinexor 60 mg or placebo twice weekly on a 42 day cycle until PD or intolerability. Patients with PD on placebo can crossover to selinexor. The primary endpoint is PFS. The study is powered to detect a 50% improvement with selinexor versus placebo. Secondary endpoints include overall survival and response rate. Planned total sample size (Phase 2+3) is 245. Enrollment began in January 2016.
