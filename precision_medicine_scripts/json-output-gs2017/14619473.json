Synchronous metastasis accounted for 5 cases and metachronous for 2 cases. Two cases were H1, 2 cases H2, and 3 cases H3. Following the resection of colorectal primary lesion, we performed RFA for liver metastasis, using a Cool-tip electrode purchased from Radionics (Burlington, MA, USA). The mean number of sessions per patient was 5.1 (1-10). Ablation time of each session was changed according to tumor size, as follows: less than 1 cm in diameter: 2 min, 2 cm: 5 min, 2.5 cm: 10 min. By using intra-operative catheterization, weekly intrahepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy was performed for liver metastasis. Excellent ablation was achieved in all cases by CT evaluation and no significant side-effect was observed. Average observation period was 15 months (maximal survival period was 31 months) and 6 patients are alive. RFA therapy combined with intrahepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy achieved excellent therapeutic effect, and maintained good quality of life in patients.","title":"[Radiofrequency ablation therapy combined with intrahepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy for liver metastasis of colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"14619473"}
