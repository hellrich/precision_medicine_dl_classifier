We also investigated lung cancer long-term survival in relation to the polymorphism, smoking data, histology, age at diagnosis, and gender. One hundred eighty-five lung-cancer patients and 164 matched controls, where non-smokers were enriched among the lung cancer cases, were genotyped by fragment analysis and sequencing. Genotypes were combined with information on histology, patient smoking status, and cancer-specific death, using a 20-year follow-up. We divided the (CCTTT)n alleles into short (n ≤ 10), intermediate (n \u003d 11-12), and long (n ≥ 13). Patients homozygous for short repeats had significantly increased risk of lung cancer (p \u003d 0.030) compared to carriers of two long alleles (LL). Lack of long allele was associated with a significantly increased lung cancer risk overall (p \u003d 0.011), especially among non-smokers (p \u003d 0.001). A significantly higher lung cancer survival was seen in non-smokers compared to smokers (p \u003d 0.046) and in low-dose smokers compared to high-dose smokers at the time of diagnosis (p \u003d 0.028). Moreover, non-smoking patients with squamous cell carcinoma (p \u003d 0.015) or adenocarcinoma (p \u003d 0.024) showed a significantly lower survival compared to other lung carcinomas. Nitric oxide can induce proliferation as well as apoptosis depending on cellular context. Our results suggest that the (CCTTT)n NOS2 microsatellite may influence the risk of developing lung cancer, especially in non-smokers, possibly by affecting intracellular nitric oxide levels. Our results also give additional information about the yet poorly understood etiological and prognostic differences between lung cancer in non-smokers and smokers.
