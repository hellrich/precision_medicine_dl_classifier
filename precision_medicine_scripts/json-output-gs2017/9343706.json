A small and efficient target carrier is the key component for anti-cancer drugs. In our laboratory, the antibody IgY was extracted from egg yolk of a SPF hen. The SPF hen was immunized with an antigene of P110 protein which was purified from human stomach cancer MGC-803 cells. Results indicated that the antibody IgY can specifically recognize gastrointestinal system cancers. It may become an important carrier for antitumorigenic drugs.","title":"The selective recognition of antibody IgY for digestive system cancers.","pubmedId":"9343706"}
