Co-existence of this condition with a pancreaticobiliary malignancy is an exceptionally rare occurrence.\nWe present a case report of a 78-year-old woman with jaundice due to an ampullary carcinoma associated with an annular pancreas treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nA collection of previously reported cases is reviewed together with the relevant literature. Obstructive jaundice is an uncommon feature of annular pancreas; hence the possibility of co-existent pancreaticobiliary malignancy should be excluded.","title":"Ampullary carcinoma associated with an annular pancreas.","pubmedId":"17228134"}
