We investigated these risks in 173 breast-ovarian cancer families with BRCA2 mutations identified at 20 centers in Europe and North America.\nOther cancer occurrence was determined in a final cohort of 3728 individuals, among whom 681 persons had breast or ovarian cancer and 3047 persons either were known mutation carriers, were first-degree relatives of known mutation carriers, or were first-degree relatives of breast or ovarian cancer patients. Incidence rates were compared with population-specific incidence rates, and relative risks (RRs) to carriers, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were estimated by use of a maximum likelihood approach. Three hundred thirty-three other cancers occurred in this cohort.\nStatistically significant increases in risks were observed for prostate cancer (estimated RR \u003d 4.65; 95% CI \u003d 3.48-6.22), pancreatic cancer (RR \u003d 3.51; 95% CI \u003d 1. 87-6.58), gallbladder and bile duct cancer (RR \u003d 4.97; 95% CI \u003d 1. 50-16.52), stomach cancer (RR \u003d 2.59; 95%CI \u003d 1.46-4.61), and malignant melanoma (RR \u003d 2.58; 95% CI \u003d 1.28-5.17). The RR for prostate cancer for men below the age of 65 years was 7.33 (95% CI \u003d 4.66-11.52). Among women who had already developed breast cancer, the cumulative risks of a second, contralateral breast cancer and of ovarian cancer by the age of 70 years were estimated to be 52.3% (95% CI \u003d 41.7%-61.0%) and 15.9% (95% CI \u003d 8.8%-22.5%), respectively.\nIn addition to the large risks of breast and ovarian cancers, BRCA2 mutations may be associated with increased risks of several other cancers.","title":"Cancer risks in BRCA2 mutation carriers.","pubmedId":"10433620"}
