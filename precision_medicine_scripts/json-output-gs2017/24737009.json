The expression of Wnt-11 and squamous cell carcinoma antigen was detected in 127 cervical cancer tissues, 21 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, as well as in 20 healthy controls by immunohistochemistry, and the relationship of Wnt-11 and squamous cell carcinoma antigen expression with clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. Both Wnt-11 and squamous cell carcinoma antigen were more commonly expressed in cervical cancer than in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and in normal cervical tissue (respectively; P \u003c 0.05); further, Wnt-11 and squamous cell carcinoma antigen expression in cervical cancer were positively correlated (r \u003d 0.271, P \u003c 0.05). In comparing the expression with clinicopathological parameters of tumor samples, Wnt-11 and squamous cell carcinoma antigen were both associated with FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size (P \u003c 0.05), but not with patient age, pathological type, or differentiation. Increased Wnt-11 protein levels in cervical carcinoma samples were associated with a poor outcome in univariate and multivariate analysis. Wnt-11 and squamous cell carcinoma antigen are related to the malignancy degree and metastasis of cervical cancer, and thus may play a coordinating role in the occurrence and progression of cervical cancer. The study indicated that Wnt-11 may be a useful prognostic indicator for cervical carcinoma.","title":"Clinical significance of Wnt-11 and squamous cell carcinoma antigen expression in cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"24737009"}
