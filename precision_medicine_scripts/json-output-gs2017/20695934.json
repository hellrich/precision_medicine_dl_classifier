Masked hypertension was defined as office BP \u003c or \u003d140/90 mm Hg and 24-hour ambulatory BP \u003e or \u003d130/80 mm Hg. The masked hypertensive participants defined by 24-hour ambulatory BP (n\u003d13) had a higher serum glucose level (126 vs 96 mg/dL, P\u003d.001) and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (38.0 vs 7.5 mg/gCr, P\u003c.001) than the normotensive participants (n\u003d74); however, these relationships were not observed when the authors defined groups using HBP (\u003e or \u003d135/85 mm Hg). Masked hypertension by both 24-hour ambulatory BP and HBP had a higher urinary albumin-creatinine ratio than normotension by both 24-hour ambulatory BP and HBP (62.1 vs 7.4 mg/gCr, P\u003d.001), and than masked hypertension by HBP alone (9.3 mg/gCr, P\u003d.009). Masked hypertension defined by 24-hour ambulatory BP is associated with an increased serum glucose level and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, but these relationships are not observed in masked hypertension defined by HBP.","title":"Masked hypertension defined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is associated with an increased serum glucose level and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio.","pubmedId":"20695934"}
