It has been suggested that HER2/neu overexpression may be related to poor prognosis in NSCLC. We evaluated the significance of HER2/neu overexpression on survival in patients with NSCLC. Data were collected on 239 patients treated surgically for stage I/II NSCLC between 1987 and 1996. None of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were stained with p185/HER2 receptor antibody. Results were reported as positive (2+, 3+) or negative (0, 1+) (Group A). A separate analysis considered only 3+ as positive (Group B). HER2/neu overexpression was seen in 18% in Group A (43 of 239) and 6% in Group B (15 of 239). HER2/neu overexpression was highest in bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. More stage I tumors were positive than stage II in both groups, but this was significant only in Group A (21% vs. 7%, P \u003d 0.02). No difference was seen with age, gender, or grade for either group. In Group A, the relapse rate was 55% for HER2/neu-overexpressing tumors and 31% for HER2/neu-negative tumors (P \u003d 0.003). Median time to relapse in patients with HER2/neu-positive tumors was 2.9 years; it was not reached in patients with HER2/neu-negative tumors. Median survival of patients with HER2/neu-positive tumors was 3.6 years compared to 5 years in patients with HER2/neu-negative tumors (P \u003d 0.66). In Group B, the relapse rate was 60% for HER2/neu-overexpressing tumors and 33% for negative tumors (P \u003d 0.036). Median time to relapse was 3.4 years in HER2/neu positive and had not been reached in negative tumors. There was no difference in 5-year survival rates for both groups (47% for HER2/neu positive and 50% for negative, P \u003d 0.66).","title":"Effect of HER2/neu expression on survival in non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"14700481"}
