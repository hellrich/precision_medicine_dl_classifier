Adhesion of prostate cancer cells to fibronectin via the integrin α5 (ITGA5) has been proposed as a candidate bone marrow niche localization mechanism. We hypothesized that the mechanisms whereby ITGA5 regulates the adhesion-mediated survival of prostate cancer cells will define novel therapeutic approaches. ITGA5 shRNA reduced expression of BCL-2 family members and induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. In these PTEN-mutant cells, pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway in combination with ITGA5 knockdown enhanced apoptosis. Chemical parsing studies with BH3 mimetics indicated that PI3K/Akt inhibition in combination with BCL-XL-specific inhibition induces synergistic apoptosis specifically in PTEN-mutant prostate cancer cells, whereas single-agent PI3K/Akt inhibitors did not. Given the importance of PTEN loss in the progression of prostate and other cancers, synthetic lethality induced by combinatorial PI3K/Akt and BCL-XL inhibition represents a valuable therapeutic strategy.\nActivation of the PI3K pathway through PTEN loss represents a major molecular pathway in the progression of prostate and other cancers. This study defines a synthetic lethal therapeutic combination with significant translational potential.\nSynthetic lethality in PTEN-mutant prostate cancer cells with combined PI3K/Akt and BCL-XL inhibition. PTEN-mutant prostate cancer cells expressing ITGA5 bind to fibronectin in the putative bone marrow niche and transduce survival signals to BCL-XL Additional PTEN-regulated signals independent of the PI3K/Akt pathway likely feed into the BCL-XL-regulated survival program to explain synthetic lethality observed with the combination.Visual Overview: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2016/12/02/1541-7786.MCR-16-0202/F1.large.jpg.
