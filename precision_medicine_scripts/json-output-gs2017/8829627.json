Barrett\u0027s esophagus provides an excellent model by which to understand the genetic events that lead from dysplasia to cancer. We screened for mutations in the TP53 gene by a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing in ten cases of adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett\u0027s mucosa. We have identified missense mutations in five of the ten samples, three transitions (R282W, G245S, R248W) and two transversions (E286Q and C176F). In one case we have analyzed biopsy specimens taken from the same site, one year before the patient developed an intra mucosal carcinoma. The mutation that was identified in this high grade dysplastic area was identical to that detected in the cancer. This would suggest TP53 mutations occur as an early genetic event in the development of Barrett\u0027s adenocarcinoma.","title":"Molecular analysis of the TP53 gene in Barrett\u0027s adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"8829627"}
