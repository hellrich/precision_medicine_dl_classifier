The authors provide a review of the current evidence for familial susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. A formal segregation analysis of the pattern of inheritance of pancreatic cancer in 70 families from the National Registry for Familial Pancreatic Cancer is described. This analysis suggests a single major gene with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance controlling susceptibility for pancreatic cancer in these families.","title":"Inheritance of pancreatic cancer in pancreatic cancer-prone families.","pubmedId":"10872424"}
