During the 1990s, mortality among more-educated 50- to 64-year-old women declined particularly fast.\nThe causes of declining differences by education in breast cancer mortality are difficult to verify, but they may be due in part to narrowing differences in reproductive behavior among the younger birth cohorts and to a period effect possibly associated with the introduction of breast cancer screening in the late 1980s.","title":"Diminishing educational differences in breast cancer mortality among Finnish women: a register-based 25-year follow-up.","pubmedId":"10667192"}
