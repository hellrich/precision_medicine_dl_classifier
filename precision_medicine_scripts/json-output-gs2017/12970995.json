While cigarette smoking is of key importance, factors such as diet also play a role in the development of lung cancer. MedLine and Embase were searched with diet and lung cancer as the key words. Recently published reviews and large well-designed original articles were preferred to form the basis of the present article. A diet rich in fruit and vegetables reduces the incidence of lung cancer by approximately 25%. The reduction is of the same magnitude in current smokers, ex-smokers and in persons who have never smoked. Vitamin A, C and E supplements and beta-carotene offer no protection against the development of lung cancer. On the contrary, in two major randomised intervention trials beta-carotene supplement has resulted in increased mortality. Smoking remains by far the leading cause of lung cancer and the adverse effects can only be slightly alleviated by a healthy diet.","title":"[Diet and lung cancer].","pubmedId":"12970995"}
