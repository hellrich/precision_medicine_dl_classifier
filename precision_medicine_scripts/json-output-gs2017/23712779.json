In the current study, it has been tried to determine the methylation status of two tumour suppressor genes p14/ARF and p16/INK4a in 150 breast cancer patients as well as 150 controls by using MSP-PCR. There was, highly significant difference in methylation of p14/ARF and p16/INK4a (P\u003d0.000) between patients and controls. Methylation of both the genes together significantly increased the risk of breast cancer by 12.31 folds. The present study concludes that hypermethylation of p14/ARF and p16/INK4a promoters demonstrate significant association with the risk of breast cancer, hence indicating these as important tumour suppressor genes involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer in North Indian population (i.e. Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh as well as Union Territory of Chandigarh).","title":"Promoter hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes (p14/ARF and p16/INK4a): case-control study in North Indian population.","pubmedId":"23712779"}
