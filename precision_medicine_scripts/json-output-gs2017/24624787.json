It was shown that total tumors regression in the early stages of the observation predominate in patients with \"high-integrated\" virus DNA (the degree of integration \u003e 50%) of compared with a group of patients with episomal and \"low-integrated\" form of the virus, but in a distant periods (3-5 years) in the first group predominate an adverse outcome of disease. This pattern is true for tumors of stage I-III, and for less common--I-II stages. It is assumed that the integration of HPV16 DNA into the cellular genome may serve as an independent predictor of clinical outcome of cervical cancer.","title":"[The significance of physical status of human papillomavirus type 16 for predicting the effectiveness of invasive cervical cancer treatment].","pubmedId":"24624787"}
