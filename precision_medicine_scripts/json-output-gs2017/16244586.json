Except for the correlation of c-erbB-3 expression with Dukes\u0027 staging, there was no correlation between the studied markers and grade of differentiation, Dukes\u0027 stage and localization of colorectal adenocarcinoma. c-erbB-3 expression was seen more frequently in tubular adenomas, while c-erbB-2 expression was higher in tubulovillous and villous types. These differences were not statistically significant. The presence of distant metastasis and angiolymphatic invasion were identified as independent predictors of survival. A positive correlation was found between VEGF expression and lymphatic vessel invasion and regional lymph node involvement.\nThese results suggest that VEGF, c-erbB-2, c-erbB-3 expression does not have prognostic value in colorectal cancer. VEGF expression may be implicated in the lymph node metastasis.","title":"Vascular endothelial growth factor, c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 expression in colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"16244586"}
