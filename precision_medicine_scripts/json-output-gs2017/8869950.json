Widespread implementation of The Bethesda System with its accompanying atlas has provided uniform terminology and criteria for reporting cervical pathology. The development of new methods for preparing cytologic specimens as well as many other screening techniques suggests that current practices may be modified in the near future. The implementation of these new approaches may permit more conservative management of women with self-limited lesions related to HPV exposure, improve detection of serious cancer precursors, and provide more cost-effective cervical cancer screening.","title":"The role of exfoliative cytology and histopathology in screening and triage.","pubmedId":"8869950"}
