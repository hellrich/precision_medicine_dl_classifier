The clinical outcome of such patients were studied. A total of 91 patients, 88 men and three women, who were endoscopically diagnosed with early hilar lung cancer were studied retrospectively. Surgery was performed in 46 patients, while organ-sparing treatment, including photodynamic therapy (PDT), Nd-YAG (neodymium-yttrium, argon, garnet) laser vaporization, and radiotherapy, were done for 45 patients. During follow-up, newly developed lung cancers and/or malignancies in other organs were recorded. The average smoking index (cigarettes per day x years) was 1040. Synchronous and/or metachronous multiple lung cancers developed in 26/91 patients (28.6%). Malignancies in other organs were found in 12/91 (13.2%). The smoking index of patients with multiple lung cancers was significantly higher than for other patients. The overall 5 year survival rate was 70.7% in all patients, 76.0% in the surgery group, and 64.4% in the nonsurgery group. The lung cancer-specific 5 year survival rate was 89.8% in all patients, 89.3% in the surgery group, and 90.5% in the nonsurgery group. Early hilar lung cancer frequently accompanies other lung cancers or malignancies in other organs. A favorable prognosis can be obtained with organ-sparing treatment.","title":"Early hilar lung cancer--risk for multiple lung cancers and clinical outcome.","pubmedId":"11429195"}
