Other than microsatellite instability, however, the genetic and most epigenetic changes of tumors associated with this polymorphism have not been studied. We evaluated associations between the -93 G\u003eA polymorphism and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), BRAF V600E mutations, and MLH1 methylation in tumors from a sample of 1,211 individuals with colon cancer and 1,968 controls from Utah, Northern California, and Minnesota. The -93 G\u003eA polymorphism was determined by the five prime nuclease assay. CIMP was determined previously by methylation-specific PCR of CpG islands in MLH1, methylated in tumors (MINT)1, MINT2, MINT31, and CDKN2A (p16). The BRAF V600E mutation was determined by sequencing exon 15. The MLH1 -93 G\u003eA promoter polymorphism was associated with CIMP (odds ratio (OR) 3.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85, 6.42), MLH1 methylation (OR 4.16, 95%CI 2.20, 7.86), BRAF mutations (OR 4.26, 95%CI 1.83, 9.91), and older age at diagnosis (OR 3.65, 95%CI 2.08, 6.39) in microsatellite unstable tumors. These associations were not observed in stable tumors. Increased age at diagnosis and tumor characteristics of microsatellite unstable tumors associated with MLH1 -93 G\u003eA suggests the polymorphism is acting at a relatively late stage of colorectal carcinogenesis to drive CIMP+ tumors down the microsatellite instability pathway.","title":"The MLH1 -93 G\u003eA promoter polymorphism and genetic and epigenetic alterations in colon cancer.","pubmedId":"18615680"}
