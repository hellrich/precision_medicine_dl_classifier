This condition occurring with a complication of a colorectal cancer has never been reported to the best of our knowledge. We present a case of a 26-year-old Nigerian man who came to us in February this year with a 10-year history of watery stool, which is also mucoid with tenesmus. There was also associated weight loss and colicky abdominal pains. He had also previously had a previous proctoscopy and rectal biopsy that showed numerous adenomatous polyps with dysplastic changes confirmed by histology. Barium enema revealed multiple polyps up to the right side of the transverse colon. Repeat histology after panproctocolectomy confirmed foci of invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon up to the muscle coat. The patient post-operatively is alive and well.","title":"Familial adenomatous polyposis complicated with an invasive colo-rectal adenocarcinoma in a 26-year-old Nigerian male - a rare finding.","pubmedId":"17371432"}
