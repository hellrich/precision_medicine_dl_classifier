Clinicopathologic characteristics were correlated to gene mutations.\nOf the 141 tumors studied, approximately 76.6% had KIT gene mutations, 2.8% had PDGFRA gene mutations and 20.6% had a wild-type gene of KIT and PDGFRA. Among those with KIT gene mutations, 70.2% occurred in exon 11, 5.7% in exon 9, 0.7% in exon 13, and no mutation was detected in exons 17. The most frequent sites of mutation were in exon 11 and the mutations clustered in the classic \"hot spot\" at the 5\u0027end of the exon mostly heterogeneous and the second \"hot spot\" were internal tandem duplications (ITD) at the 3\u0027end of the exon. The overall mutation rate was significantly lower in GISTs originated from colorectum or extra-gastrointestinal tract (chi(2) \u003d 6.728, P \u003d 0.009; chi(2) \u003d 4.059, P \u003d 0.044), however, mutation rate on exon 11 was significantly increased in gastric stromal tumor (chi(2) \u003d 5.713, P \u003d 0.017; chi(2) \u003d 4.341, P \u003d 0.037). There were no significant differences in terms of age, gender, tumor size, mitotic counts, grade of malignant potential and liver metastasis in patients with or without gene mutations.\nKIT and PDGFRA gene were frequently found in patients with GISTs. Gene mutation rate varies in originated organ.","title":"The analysis of status and clinical implication of KIT and PDGFRA mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).","pubmedId":"18618605"}
