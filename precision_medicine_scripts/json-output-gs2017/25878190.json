Mutational analyses [polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA sequencing method, mass spectrometric detection (Sequenom MassARRAY), or next-generation sequencing] as well as loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (immunohistochemistry) were performed (archived tissue when available).\nTwenty-three patients (one of whom was on two separate trials) were treated using temsirolimus-containing regimens: temsirolimus alone (n \u003d 1 patient) or combined with the following: liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab (DAT, n \u003d 18); liposomal doxorubicin (DT, n \u003d 1); paclitaxel and bevacizumab (TAT, n \u003d 2); paclitaxel (TT, n \u003d 1); carboplatin and bevacizumab (CAT, n \u003d 1). Response rate [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] was 25% across all regimens; 32% in the anthracycline-based regimens [DAT and DT (CR \u003d 2, PR \u003d 4; N \u003d 19)]. An additional two patients achieved stable disease (SD) ≥6 months [total SD ≥6 months/CR/PR \u003d 8 (33%)]. Molecular aberrations in the PI3K pathway were common: PIK3CA mutation \u003d 6/15 (40%), PTEN mutation \u003d 3/11 (27%), and PTEN loss \u003d 2/11 (18%). A point mutation in the NF2 gene (K159fs*16; NF2 alterations can activate mTor) was found in one patient who attained CR (3+ years). Of the eight patients who achieved SD ≥6 months/CR/PR, all 4 patients with available tissue had a molecular aberration that activate the PIK3CA/Akt/mTOR axis: PIK3CA mutation \u003d 2; PTEN loss \u003d 1; NF2 aberration \u003d 1.\nDAT has activity in MpBCs including complete CRs. Molecular aberrations that can activate the PI3 K/Akt/mTOR axis are common in MpBC.","title":"Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway for the treatment of patients with metastatic metaplastic breast cancer.","pubmedId":"25878190"}
