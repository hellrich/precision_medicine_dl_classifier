One was a 68-year-old woman with epigastralgia and vomiting. A submucosal tumor of the upper jejunum was detected, and partial resection was carried out. The histology revealed a GIST negative for CD34 but positive for CD117. The other was a 42-year-old woman with progressive anemia, melena and lower abdominal pain. Intussusception was detected, and a partial resection was carried out. A submucosal tumor of the lower jejunum was noted. The histology revealed a GIST positive for both CD34 and CD117.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the small intestine that expressed c-kit protein.","pubmedId":"11065242"}
