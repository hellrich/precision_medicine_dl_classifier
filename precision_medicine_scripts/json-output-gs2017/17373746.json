Tissue samples were assessed with KIT (CD117 antigen), CD34, SMA, desmin, S-100, NSE, PCNA, Ki-67, and BCL-2 for immunohistochemical study and pathological characteristics were analyzed for prognostic factors.\nFifteen tumors (30%) were negative in KIT staining. A significant association was observed between gender (male patients: 14/15) and KIT-negative staining (P \u003d 0.003).The patients\u0027s mean age was 56.6 years. Tumors developed in stomach (n \u003d 8), small intestine (n \u003d 5), large intestine (n \u003d 1) and oesophagus (n \u003d 1). The mean tumor size was 5.72 cm. The mitotic count ranged from 0-29/50 HPF (mean: 3.4) and 73% of tumors showed no necrosis. The majority of the tumors (67%) had dual or epithelioid differentiation. Tumors were classified as very low or low risk (n \u003d 7), intermediate risk (n \u003d 5), and high risk (n \u003d 3) groups. Twelve (80%) patients were alive without evidence of residual tumor for an average period of 40.25 mo (12-82 mo); three patients developed metastatic disease to the liver and eventually died within 2-12 mo (median survival: 8.6 mo).\nA small subgroup of GISTs fulfils the clinical and morphological criteria of these tumors, and lacks KIT expression. These tumors predominantly developed in the stomach, being dual or epithelioid in morphology, which are classified as low risk tumors and presented a better survival status than KIT-positive tumors. The ability to diagnose GISTs still depends on immunohistochemical staining but the research should extend in gene mutations.","title":"KIT-negative gastrointestinal stromal tumors with a long term follow-up: a new subgroup does exist.","pubmedId":"17373746"}
