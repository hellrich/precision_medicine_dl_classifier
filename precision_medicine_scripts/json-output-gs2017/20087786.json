Our goal was to examine efficacy of adjuvant CRT in resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared with surgery alone.\nPatients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma at Johns Hopkins Hospital (n \u003d 794, 1993-2005) and Mayo Clinic (n \u003d 478, 1985-2005) following resection who were observed (n \u003d 509) or received adjuvant 5-FU based CRT (median dose 50.4 Gy; n \u003d 583) were included. Cox survival and propensity score analyses assessed associations with overall survival. Matched-pair analysis by treatment group (1:1) based on institution, age, sex, tumor size/stage, differentiation, margin, and node positivity with N \u003d 496 (n \u003d 248 per treatment arm) was performed.\nMedian survival was 18.8 months. Overall survival (OS) was longer among recipients of CRT versus surgery alone (median survival 21.1 vs. 15.5 months, P \u003c .001; 2- and 5-year OS 44.7 vs. 34.6%; 22.3 vs. 16.1%, P \u003c .001). Compared with surgery alone, adjuvant CRT improved survival in propensity score analysis for all patients by 33% (P \u003c .001), with improved survival when stratified by age, margin, node, and T-stage (RR \u003d 0.57-0.75, P \u003c .05). Matched-pair analysis demonstrated OS was longer with CRT (21.9 vs. 14.3 months median survival; 2- and 5-year OS 45.5 vs. 31.4%; 25.4 vs. 12.2%, P \u003c .001).\nAdjuvant CRT is associated with improved survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Adjuvant CRT was not associated with decreased survival in any risk group, even in propensity score and matched-pair analyses. Further studies evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy compared with adjuvant chemoradiation are needed to determine the most effective combination of systemic and local-regional therapy to achieve optimal survival results.","title":"Adjuvant chemoradiation for pancreatic adenocarcinoma: the Johns Hopkins Hospital-Mayo Clinic collaborative study.","pubmedId":"20087786"}
