Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 52 x 28 mm, well-circumscribed, homogenously enhancing mass lesion without dural attachment located in the left lateral cerebellomedullary cistern. The tumor was excised, and a histological diagnosis was a mixed pattern meningioma of meningothelial and fibroblastic type. A meningioma in the posterior fossa without dural attachment is quite rare. We report a rare case of lateral cerebellomedullary cistern meningioma without dural attachment with literature review.","title":"Meningioma in the Lateral Cerebellomedullary Cistern without Dural Attachment.","pubmedId":"20617095"}
