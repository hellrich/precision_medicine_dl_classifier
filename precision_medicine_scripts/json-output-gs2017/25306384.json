Over the past decade, research has evolved in the science of identifying targeted biological changes in DNA and individual cancer cells. Along with the advanced understanding of lung cancer mutations, has come the development of specific targeted therapies that improve patient outcomes. The first step in treating a patient with lung cancer is proper diagnosis and staging, applying to the principles of personalize medicine. Our current understanding of lung cancer is that of a collection of diseases individualized through specific mutations. This CME activity reviews the role of the pulmonologist and pathologist in proper tissue acquisition and analysis. This new era of personalized medicine and clinical research advances has changed the way clinicians evaluate and treat patients with lung cancer. The data on lung cancer cell mutations and newer targeted therapies have improved the progression free survival and quality of life of lung cancer patients. This CME activity is designed to present a practical overview of recent evidenced based data of MET targeted therapies for patients with lung cancer. As research continues to evolve, we continue to advance our understanding in the science of lung cancers involving the MET pathway. Evidenced based data supporting newer targeted therapeutics provides insight on applying treatment for optimal outcomes. This CME activity will focus on the individualized treatment strategies using practical decision making for patients with MET expression. This activity has been designed to meet the educational needs of medical oncologists, pathologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, pulmonologists, internists, and other healthcare clinicians responsible for the care of patients with lung cancer.
