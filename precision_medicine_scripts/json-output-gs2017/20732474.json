All three tumors were surgically resected by minimal invasive approach. Based on a differing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status, the tumors were characterized as synchronous triple primary rather than intrapulmonary metastases. This report highlights the clinical usefulness of molecular cancer biomarkers to determine prognosis and to guide management decision in multiple lung tumors.","title":"Synchronous primary lung cancer and epidermal growth factor receptor mutation.","pubmedId":"20732474"}
