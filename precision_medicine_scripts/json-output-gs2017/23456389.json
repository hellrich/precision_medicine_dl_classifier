Rectal cancers carrying both mutations are less likely to respond to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) compared with wild-type tumors. Codon-specific KRAS mutations are associated with variable resistance to targeted therapies, but their association with rectal cancer response to CRT remains unclear. Our objective was to establish a correlation between specific KRAS mutations and rectal cancer response to CRT and to investigate if the correlation was related to a different association between KRAS and TP53 mutations.\nA total of 148 stage II-III rectal cancer patients underwent preoperative CRT followed by surgery. DNA was extracted from pretreatment tumor biopsies and paired normal surgical tissues and KRAS and TP53 genotyping was performed. Specific KRAS mutations were then correlated with tumor response and with concurrent TP53 mutation.\nA total of 60 patients had KRAS mutation, 12 in codon 13 and 48 in other locations. Also, 80 patients had TP53 mutation; 27 had concurrent KRAS/TP53 mutations. Tumors with any KRAS mutation were less likely to have a pCR compared with wild-type KRAS (p \u003d 0.006). Specifically, no tumors with KRAS codon 13 mutations had a pCR (p \u003d 0.03). Tumors with KRAS codon 13 mutations also had a higher incidence of concurrent TP53 mutation compared with tumors with other KRAS mutations (p \u003d 0.02).\nMutations in different KRAS codons may have different effects on rectal cancer resistance to CRT. This variable resistance may be related to a different frequency of TP53 mutations in KRAS mutant tumors.","title":"Mutations in specific codons of the KRAS oncogene are associated with variable resistance to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23456389"}
