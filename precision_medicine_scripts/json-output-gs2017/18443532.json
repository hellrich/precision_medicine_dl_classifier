They are believed to originate from interstitial cells of Cajal or related stem cells. Diagnosis is based on histological and immunohistochemical examination, and these rare tumors are characterized by c-kit (CD117) staining. We present an analysis of clinical presentation and course, surgical management and pathological features of 11 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated in our institution from 2002 to 2007. 2 patients with malignant retroperitoneal GIST had disease progression/recurrence and died. They received adjuvant imatinib therapy. 9 patients are disease free on the 3-d year of the follow-up. Our results confirm that in stromal tumors complete surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment in localized gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Complete removal of the tumor is often curative in localized gastrointestinal stromal tumors and is always recommended. Clinically, their behavior is difficult to predict, and mitotic count and tumor size seem to be the most effective prognostic factors. It is conceivable that treatment and prognosis of metastatic and non - resectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as well as the adjuvant treatment of high-risk, radically excised gastrointestinal stromal tumors will be strongly impacted by the c-kit target therapy.","title":"[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) - clinical experience and current therapeutical aspects].","pubmedId":"18443532"}
