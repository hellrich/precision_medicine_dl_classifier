Methods: Baseline characteristics, vemurafenib-related adverse events, and efficacy data were collected from 65 mm pts who were treated with vemurafenib. Results: From April 2013 till December 2015, 129 pts were diagnosed with mm and in 71 pts (55%) tumor tissue was positive for BRAF V600E/K mutation (87% BRAF V600E and 13% BRAF V600K). 65 BRAF-positive pts were treated with vemurafenib therapy (median age 54, males 68%). Vemurafenib was given as first, second or third line treatment to 56 (86%), 6 (9%) and 3 (5%) pts respectively. Distribution by dissemination site was 74% M1c, 14% M1a and 12% M1b. Overall response rate (ORR) was 46%, and disease control rate (DCR) was 73%. Complete response (CR) was reported in 5 pts (9%), partial response (PR) in 20 pts (37%) and stable disease (SD) in 15 pts (27%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.4 months (95% CI, 4.9-7.9). At the time of analysis 9 pts are still on vemurafenib treatment. Median overall survival (OS) was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.4-9.0) with 22 (41%) pts alive at the time of data analysis. OS for subgroup of patients with BRAF V600E mutation was 6.8 months (95% CI, 4.8-8.8) and BRAF V600K was 10.1 months (95% CI, 6.7-13.5). Both PFS and OS were shorter in patients with increased lactate dehydrogenase concentration at baseline: normal serum LDH  median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI, 4.7-10.9), medians OS was 10.1 months (95% CI, 6.6-13.6); elevated serum LDH  median PFS was 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.9-5.7), medians OS was 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.1-7.3). Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 85% of pts. 83% of reported AEs were grade 1-2. The most frequent grade 3-4 AEs were rash (19%), fatigue (3%), SCC (3%), liver injury (3%), arthralgia (2%), myalgia (2%), oedema (2%) and anemia (2%). Conclusions: In line with results from randomized clinical studies vemurafenib demonstrated better outcomes in mm patients with BRAF V600K mutation and normal serum LDH concentration also in routine clinical practice.","title":"Treatment with vemurafenib in patients with metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_164826-176"}
