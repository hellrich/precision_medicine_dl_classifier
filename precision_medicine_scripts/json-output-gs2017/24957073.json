In a retrospective biomarker analysis, TP53 was not prognostic but emerged as an independent predictive biomarker for cetuximab benefit. After a median follow-up of 65.0 months, TP53 wild-type patients (n \u003d 69) who received cetuximab had a statistically significant better PFS (89.3% vs 65.0% at 5 years; hazard ratio [HR] \u003d 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] \u003d 0.07 to 0.78; two-sided P \u003d .02 by Cox regression) and OS (92.7% vs 67.5% at 5 years; HR \u003d 0.16; 95% CI \u003d 0.04 to 0.70; two-sided P \u003d .02 by Cox regression) than TP53 wild-type patients who were treated in the control arm. An interaction between TP53 status and cetuximab effect was found (P \u003c .05) and remained statistically significant after adjusting for statistically significant prognostic factors and KRAS.
