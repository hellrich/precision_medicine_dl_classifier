Total RNA was extracted from cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa from frozen biopsy specimens of 30 patients with gastric cancer, and MACC-1 expression was assessed by RT-PCR. MACC-1 and c-MET protein expression were also assessed in paraffin-embedded tissues obtained from 436 tumor mucosa and 92 normal mucosa specimens by immunohistochemistry. The correlation between MACC-1 and c-MET expression and clinicopathological factors (age, sex, histology, tumor depth, lymph node status and vessel invasion) were also evaluated. RT-PCR analysis revealed that MACC-1 expression was significantly higher in cancerous mucosa compared with normal tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that MACC-1 and c-MET were moderately or strongly expressed in gastric cancer tissue, whereas expression was weak or absent in non-cancer tissue. Expression of MACC-1 or c-MET was significantly associated with larger tumor size, deeper tumor invasion, presence of lymph node metastasis, lymphatic involvement, venous invasion, distant metastasis and advanced clinical stage. However, only MACC-1 exhibited significantly greater expression in carcinomas from the higher age group. The intensity of MACC-1 and c-MET expression was also positively correlated. Survival analysis of the 436 gastric cancer patients revealed that patients in clinical stages I, II and III exhibiting lower MACC-1 and c-MET expression had a higher 5-year survival rate compared with patients expressing high levels of these proteins. Multivariate analysis revealed that MACC-1 and c-MET may be independent prognostic indexes of gastric carcinoma (P \u003c 0.01). Our findings confirm that MACC-1 and c-MET expression is strongly related to gastric cancer stage and degree of malignancy, and is inversely correlated to patient prognosis. Thus, MACC-1 and c-MET may interact to promote tumorigenesis and their expression may be used as independent prognostic markers in gastric cancer.","title":"Prognostic value and clinical pathology of MACC-1 and c-MET expression in gastric carcinoma.","pubmedId":"23812675"}
