It is relevant to identify HNPCC patients because colonoscopic screening of individuals with HNPCC mutations reduces cancer morbidity and mortality. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is characteristic of HNPCC tumors. A panel of five markers (BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250, the so-called Bethesda markers) has been proposed for screening for MSI. To test a hypothesis that the use of BAT26 alone is feasible in screening for MLH1/MSH2 mutation-positive HNPCC patients, we compared the MSI results of 494 colorectal cancer patients obtained using BAT26 with results obtained using the Bethesda markers. BAT26 was able to identify all 27 mutation-positive individuals in this series. The marker failed to identify 2 high MSI tumors and 20 low MSI tumors, all of which expressed MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 when scrutinized by immunohistochemistry.","title":"Microsatellite marker analysis in screening for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).","pubmedId":"11389088"}
