Because the influence of cyclin E expression on outcome is yet to be examined in pancreatic cancer, we assessed the relationship between the expression of cyclin E, p27(Kip1), and survival in a large cohort of pancreatic cancer patients with long-term follow-up. Expression of cyclin E and p27(Kip1) was assessed by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays of tumor samples from 118 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (75 resections and 43 biopsies). High cyclin E expression (\u003e10% positive nuclei) was identified in 39 of 118 (33%) patients. This was associated with poor prognosis on univariate analysis in the whole cohort (P \u003d 0.005), as well as in the subgroup of 75 patients who underwent operative resection (P \u003d 0.04). On multivariate analysis, high cyclin E expression was an independent predictor of poor survival in both the entire cohort (P \u003d 0.005) and the resected subgroup (P \u003d 0.03), and was superior to all tested clinicopathologic factors (tumor size, lymph node metastases, differentiation, margin involvement, and perineural invasion) as a marker of survival. Low p27(Kip1) expression (\u003c5% positive nuclei) was present in 41 of 111 (37%) patients, but was not associated with survival, and coexpression of p27(Kip1) did not influence the association of high cyclin E expression with poor survival. High cyclin E expression is a strong independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with pancreatic cancer. Thus, if these data are confirmed in independent cohorts, measurement of cyclin E may add significant prognostic information to the currently used clinicopathologic variables and hence have potential clinical utility in the management of this disease.","title":"Cyclin E expression and outcome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"17035403"}
