SHP2 implicitly contributes to tumorigenesis, but the role of SHP2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance and associated expression of SHP2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. We used immunohistochemistry to assess the protein expression levels of SHP2 in 79 PDAC specimens. The correlations between SHP2 expression and various clinicopathological features were evaluated by Pearson\u0027s chi-square (χ (2)) test, Fisher\u0027s exact test, and Spearman\u0027s rank. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify correlations between the immunohistochemical data for SHP2 expression and the clinicopathologic characteristics in PDAC. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to demonstrate the relation between overall survival and the expression of SHP2. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly higher rates of high SHP2 expression in PDAC tissues (55.7 %) versus adjacent non-cancer tissues (10.1 %) (P \u003c 0.05). Expression of SHP2 was only significantly correlated with histological differentiation (P \u003d 0.033) and vital status (P \u003d 0.025). Patients with high SHP2 expression had shorter overall survival times compared to those with low SHP2 expression (P \u003d 0.000). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that SHP2 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor in PDAC (P \u003d 0.012). Our study demonstrated for the first time that higher expression of SHP2 might be involved in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting that SHP2 may be a potential prognostic marker and target for therapy.
