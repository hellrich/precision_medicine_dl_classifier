Methods: This feasibility study recruited prostate cancer patients from four cancer centres between November 2014 and June 2015. Eligible patients were those attending radiation or surgical oncology consultation, follow-up, or on-treatment review. Patient participants completed the EPIC-CP symptom reporting tool, results of which were reviewed as part of the clinical encounter with nurse and/or physician. Experience with the tool was evaluated from the patient perspective through a 9-item Patient Exit Survey; and from the provider perspective, through semi-structured qualitative interviews. Results from the patient and provider perspectives were analyzed and compared to identify common themes. Results: A total of 287 Patient Exit Surveys were completed. Patients averaged 2.8 EPIC-CP screens during the study. Missing data across all 16 items ranging from 0.5% (bowel function) to 9.5% (orgasm quality). Eighty-two percent (82%) of patients were willing to complete similar questionnaires at future clinic visits. Only a few patients (3.5%) felt that the EPIC-CP tool did not help with their clinical encounter, and only 4% felt that the content should not include questions about sexual functioning. Thematic analysis from provider interviews revealed that the EPIC-CP tool captures essential prostate-specific effects that facilitated person-centered communication and customization of interventions. Conclusions: EPIC-CP is highly endorsed by healthcare practitioners and by prostate patients across consultation and follow-up visits, and across four diverse cancer centres. The EPIC-CP tool captures prostate-specific symptom information that assists in enhancing clinical care and symptom management. Provincial roll-out of this tool as a standard of care is recommended.","title":"Evaluation of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) tool: Acceptability, feasibility and potential role in enhancing clinical care of men with early-stage prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_170020-176"}
