All of these agents have resulted in a significant survival benefit as compared to their control group. However, treatment responses might differ depending on the associated comorbidities and the extent and the biological aggressiveness of the disease. Furthermore, treatment associated side effects differ between the various drugs. As new drugs become approved, new treatment strategies and markers to best select which patients will best respond to which drug are needed. It is the aim of the current article to: (1) summarize the data of established treatment options in mCRPC; (2) highlight new developments of medical treatment; (3) provide clinically useful algorithms for the daily routine and to (4) point out future developments of medical treatment.
