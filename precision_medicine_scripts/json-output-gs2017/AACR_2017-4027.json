RAS proteins are small GTPases that oscillate between an active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound state to function as plasma membrane localized molecular switches in growth factor regulated signaling pathways. Mutation in HRAS, KRAS and NRAS are present in nearly 30% of human tumors. In particular, KRAS is mutated in almost 90% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Considering the requirement of the plasma membrane for KRAS activity, we are setting up ‘screenable’ biophysical platforms to understand the importance of lipids and find small molecules that could prevent KRAS membrane association in reconstituted systems. The two main techniques that are being developed are Surface Plasmon Resonance and Confocal Imaging in model membranes. Using these two techniques, we have been able to better understand the main lipids that drive KRAS membrane association and set up platforms that can be screened by small/large molecules. Biophysical techniques are frequently used by pharmaceutical companies as primary or secondary screening platforms. Developing such platforms for KRAS membrane interaction could enable the discovery of anti-cancer tool compounds.","title":"Developing biophysical platforms to study KRAS membrane interaction in artificial membranes.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-4027"}
