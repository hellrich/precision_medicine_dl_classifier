In this report, mutations found: EGFR 17%, KRAS 22%, HER2 0.6%, PIK3CA 1.2%, BRAF 2%, MET amplification 0.6%, MAP2K1 0.4%, NRAS 0.4%, AKT 0%, ALK rearrangements 7%. However little is known about ethnic difference of driver mutation frequencies and correlations between driver mutations and histological subtypes in lung adenocarcinoma.  Methods: Known driver mutations in tumors from 97 Japanese patients with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between 1999 and 2003 in National Cancer Center Hospital East were analyzed by next-generation sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Correlations between driver mutations and histological subtypes were also assessed. Results: Driver mutations were detected in 72% of tumors. Mutations found: EGFR 57%, KRAS9%, HER2 2%, PIK3CA 2%, BRAF 1%, MET amplification 1%, MAP2K1 0%, NRAS 0%, AKT 0%. Due to the limitation of rearrangement detection by exon-sequencing, ALK rearrangements were not analyzed. Compared with the report by LCMC, the frequency of EGFR mutations was high and that of KRAS mutations was low in the present study. All mutations were mutually exclusive. The number of predominant histological subtypes of tumors harbored EGFR mutations were papillary 28, acinar 3, solid 5, lepidic 19. That with KRAS mutations showed papillary 2, acinar 2, solid 2, lepidic 3, and HER2 mutations showed papillary 1 and acinar 1. Two tumors harbored PIK3CA mutations showed both histological acinar pattern. Each of BRAF mutation and MET amplification showed lepidic and papillary pattern, respectively. Conclusions: It was suggested that there should be ethnic difference of driver mutation frequencies in lung adenocarcinoma between Asian and non-Asian patients, although the details of ethnic distribution included in LCMC study has not been opened. In addition, each driver mutations did not correspond to specific histological subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Ethnic difference of driver mutation frequencies and correlations between driver mutations and histologic subtypes in lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_99954-114"}
