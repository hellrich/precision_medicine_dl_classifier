A 23-year-old male presented to Oita Medical Center (Oita, Japan) with the complaint of dysuria and anal pain. A large mass in the prostate and a number of swollen lymph nodes in the pelvic region were identified by a computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was, thus, admitted to Oita University Hospital (Yufu, Japan), where a biopsy of the prostate gland was performed. Histological analysis revealed small round cells that were positive for MIC-2 expression and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis detected a translocation involving Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 at chromosome 22q12. Thus, a diagnosis of PNET of the prostate was established. Systemic chemotherapy was the selected treatment, however, a poor response was obtained. The patient succumbed approximately four months after the initial onset of symptoms. PNET of the prostate has been reported in eight cases worldwide; in comparison, the present case exhibited the most unsatisfactory outcome.","title":"Rapidly progressive primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the prostate: A case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"25624891"}
