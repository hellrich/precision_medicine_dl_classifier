If exposed to UV light, these two melanins were reported to behave differently; eumelanin was photoprotective whereas pheomelanin was phototoxic to cultured tumor cells. Our previous study indicated that dysplastic melanocytic nevus (DMN) undergoes altered melanogenesis, forming pheomelanosome-like granules. The present study examined chemically the type and degree of melanin synthesized in 31 melanocytic nevi excised from 27 patients as compared with that occurring in the surrounding normal skin. The tissue content of eumelanin and pheomelanin was expressed by the amounts of pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA) and aminohydroxyphenylalanine (AHP), respectively. We found that DMN lesions contain significantly higher amounts of pheomelanin than either common melanocytic nevus (CMN) or normal skin. Differences in pheomelanin content between DMN and CMN could not be accounted for by inherently higher levels of pheomelanin within the skin in general from DMN patients. Our present finding substantiates our previous claim that epidermal melanocytes in DMN undergo deranged melanogenesis.","title":"Dysplastic melanocytic nevi contain high levels of pheomelanin: quantitative comparison of pheomelanin/eumelanin levels between normal skin, common nevi, and dysplastic nevi.","pubmedId":"1816549"}
