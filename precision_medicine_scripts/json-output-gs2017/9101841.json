Operative morbidity (7.8%) and mortality (3.1%) were low, although multivisceral reactions were necessary in the majority of cases (73% of all primary tumors). The single most important prognostic factor was a potentially curative resection at first operation (5-year survival: RO: 75%, R1/R2: 34%), but also at first operation for tumor recurrence.","title":"[Results of surgical therapy of primary and recurrent retroperitoneal liposarcoma].","pubmedId":"9101841"}
