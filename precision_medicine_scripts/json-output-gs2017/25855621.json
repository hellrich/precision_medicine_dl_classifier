Efficacy and toxicity of the agent were evaluated.\nIn total, 519 patients Chinese patients were analyzed. The TRUST-China had similar baseline characteristics to TRUST-Global except the greater percentage of adenocarcinoma and non-smoker cases. The response rate and disease control rate were 24.7 and 75.3%, respectively. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.4 and 15.4 months in the general Chinese population in the TRUST, and 10.2 and 18.9 months in non-smokers with adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 254). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly longer in non-smokers with adenocarcinoma than those in other groups (P ≤ 0.0001 and P ≤ 0.0001, respectively). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (≥ 2 vs. ≤ 1, hazard ratio \u003d 1.746, P \u003c 0.0001) and histology (squamous cell carcinoma vs. adenocarcinoma, hazard ratio \u003d 1.595, P \u003d 0.0008) were independent risk factors that affected survival according to Cox regression multivariate analysis.\nWe confirmed the efficacy and safety of erlotinib in Chinese patients. Non-smoking patients with adenocarcinoma histology had the best clinical benefits.
