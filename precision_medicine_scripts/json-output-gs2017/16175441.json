We present the case of a 56-year-old woman who was admitted for angina and syncope, and in whom a mobile intracardiac mass obstructing the left ventricular outflow tract and protruding into the aortic root during systole was detected by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). She reported an antecedent of the complete excision of a myxoid liposarcoma of the thigh 12 years before. A surgical resection procedure was performed through an excision of the anterior wall of the left ventricle. The histopathological analysis of the specimens obtained during surgery revealed a low-grade malignancy myxoid liposarcoma, similar to the one resected in the thigh 12 years before. The present case is the first one to report syncope due to left ventricular outflow tract as a cause for admission. TEE was able to visualize the metastatic tumor to the heart, accurately localize its position and allow for prompt surgical treatment that produced relief of the symptoms.","title":"Liposarcoma causing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and syncope: a case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"16175441"}
