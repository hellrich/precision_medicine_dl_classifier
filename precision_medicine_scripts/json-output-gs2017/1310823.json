Since the inception of the Boston Center for Liver Transplantation (BCLT) in 1983, 33 of 383 (8.6%) liver allograft recipients have undergone orthotopic transplantation as definitive treatment for otherwise unresectable cancer. Diagnoses included hepatocellular carcinoma (HCCA) in 24 patients (73%), and cholangiocarcinoma (CHCA) in 9 patients (27%). Actuarial survival rates for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were 71%, 56%, and 42% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The actuarial survival rates for patients with cholangiocarcinoma were 89% at 6 months, and 56% at 1, 2, and 3 years. Of the nine patients with cholangiocarcinoma, 56% (5/9) developed recurrent disease. Although this recurrence rate is disheartening, because of the lack of other morbidity, long-term survival in these patients is comparable to patients with HCCA. In contrast, recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma developed in 25% of recipients (5/20) who survived longer than 3 months posttransplantation. Other causes of death in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma included perioperative complications, 16.6% (4/24); sepsis, 8.3% (2/24); coronary artery disease, 4.2% (1/24); and lymphoma, 4.2% (1/24). Favorable prognostic factors included: primary tumor less than 3 cm in size and absence of associated cirrhosis. These results emphasize that orthotopic liver transplantation can provide a long-term cure for approximately 50% of patients whose primary hepatic malignancy is unresectable by conventional procedures.","title":"Liver transplantation for primary hepatic cancer.","pubmedId":"1310823"}
