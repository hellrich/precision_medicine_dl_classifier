Children and young adults are most frequently affected and they usually present with medically refractory seizures. PXAs involving the spinal cord have been rarely documented. We describe a 15-year-old boy who presented with shoulder/neck pain and upper extremity numbness/weakness. Neuroimaging revealed a solid, contrast enhancing, and intramedullary C5 - C6 mass. Microscopy demonstrated a typical WHO grade II PXA. Molecular testing did not reveal a BRAF V600E, IDH1 R132H, or IDH2 R172H mutation. Two years after a near total resection, significant tumor progression was noted via neuroimaging. To the authors\u0027 knowledge, this is the first description of the molecular characteristics of a spinal cord PXA.
