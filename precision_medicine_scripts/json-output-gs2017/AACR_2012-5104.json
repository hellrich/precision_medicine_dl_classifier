While significant research has implicated multiple genes in disease pathogenesis, identification of therapeutic leads has been difficult. The majority of currently available therapies provide only marginal benefit. To address this issue, our goal was to assess global somatic events across multiple pancreatic tumors by using next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS). Experimental Design: We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on paired tumor and normal samples from 3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. Additionally, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) on 2 of these patients tumors for which tumor RNA was available. Results: We generated on average 132 billion mappable bases across all patients using WGS, and identified 140 somatic coding events including point mutations, insertion/deletions, and chromosomal copy number variants. Data from WGS and WTS were integrated and analyzed to identify the most heavily affected pancreatic cancer pathways across all patients. The KRAS signaling pathway was identified as the most significant map. Unbiased global pathway analysis was also performed to identify processes that may be impacted. Consistent with the previous analysis, the most significant pathway from this analysis is also KRAS signaling. This integrated analysis specifically identifies heavily affected pathways in pancreatic cancer and pinpoints genes and processes that may be considered as targets for more effective therapies. Conclusions: While sequencing of additional patients is necessary to strengthen selection of key pathways, we demonstrate the utility of using NGS to understand the processes driving pancreatic adenocarcinoma so that standardized treatments for patients may be improved.","title":"Identification of key tumorigenic pathways in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients using massively parallel DNA and RNA sequencing","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5104"}
