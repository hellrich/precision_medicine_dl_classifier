Patient demographics, disease characteristics, therapy regimens, and overall survival (OS) from first (90)Y radioembolization were compared between patients with KRAS wild-type (wt) and mutant status. Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox regression were used for survival analysis and to assess independent prognostic factors for OS.\nOf 186 patients, 104 underwent KRAS mutation analysis before (90)Y radioembolization, with 45 (43.3%) identified as mutant. The wt and mutant groups were similar in demographics, liver status, overall performance status, and tumor characteristics (all P \u003e .05). Mean time from liver metastasis to (90)Y radioembolization was greater in patients with KRAS wt status (P \u003d .033). A greater percentage of wt patients received anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapies before (90)Y radioembolization (66.1% vs 8.9%; P \u003c .001). Median OS from first (90)Y radioembolization was significantly greater in KRAS wt patients (9.5 mo vs 4.8 mo; P \u003d .041). Univariate analysis identified Child-Pugh class, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), chemotherapy after (90)Y radioembolization, KRAS status, and treatment-induced toxicity as prognostic factors for OS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated Child-Pugh class, CEA, and KRAS status to be independent prognostic factors for OS, even when correcting for the effect of chemotherapy after (90)Y radioembolization.\nPatients with CRC and KRAS wt may derive greater survival benefit from (90)Y radioembolization therapy than patients with KRAS mutant.","title":"KRAS Status as an Independent Prognostic Factor for Survival after Yttrium-90 Radioembolization Therapy for Unresectable Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases.","pubmedId":"26210240"}
