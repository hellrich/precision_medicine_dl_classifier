Detection of these genetic alterations in circulating DNA has potential clinical applications. We investigated the relationship between mutant BRAF in plasma DNA and treatment response.  Methods:  DNA was extracted from plasma using the iPrep PureLink Virus Kit on an iPrep purification system (Invitrogen). BRAF mutations were detected using the Therascreen BRAF RGQ kit (Qiagen).  Results:  Seventeen patients (1 stage IIIC and 16 stage IV) with a mutated BRAF melanoma (V600E in all cases) were included. Pretreatment plasma samples were available in 10 of them, and the BRAF mutation was detected in 8 samples (80% sensitivity). Twelve patients were treated with a BRAF inhibitor, 4 with a combination of a BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor, and one patient was treated with chemotherapy (DTIC). After 3 months of melanoma treatment, the BRAF V600 mutation was detected in the plasma of 9 patients (9/17; 53,9%). The presence of mutant BRAF in plasma DNA was compared to the clinical response of patients. The BRAF mutation was present in the plasma of 6 out of the 7 patients who did not respond to treatment. In contrast, mutant BRAF DNA was absent from plasma in 7 out of the 10 patients with partial response to treatment (Fishers exact test : p \u003d 0.04977). Mutant BRAF in circulating DNA was not associated with the number of metastatic sites at the same time (mean 2.625 in patients with mutant BRAF, and 2.22 in patients without mutant BRAF; p \u003d 0.4266, Wilcoxons test).   Conclusions:  The sensitive detection of mutant BRAF in plasma would be useful for predicting treatment response to targeted therapy.
