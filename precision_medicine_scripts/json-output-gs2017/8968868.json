Five cases of metastatic pancreatic cancer to the skin are presented and discussed with a review of 17 previous case reports. In 20 cases, the cutaneous metastases were present prior to the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The most common site of cutaneous metastases originating from pancreatic cancer was the umbilicus. Although such cases are rare, it is important to note that metastatic lesions in the skin may be the first sign and one type of distant metastases originating from pancreatic cancer.","title":"Cutaneous metastases from pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"8968868"}
