Single reports mention HER-2/neu positivity in hematological malignancies like Hodgkins\u0027s disease and even diffuse large-cell lymphoma.\nTo test for HER-2/neu overexpression in patients with non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma and the possible role of the recombinant monoclonal anti-HER-2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma.\nSerum samples from 87 consecutive unselected patients with non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma were retrospectively retrieved from a serum bank and tested for the shed antigen of HER-2/neu using the Oncogene Sciences ELISA assay (Cambridge, MA, USA). From those lymphoma patients, the paraffin-embedded lymph-node specimens of 25 cases with diffuse large-cell lymphoma were stained with the HER-2/neu DAKO HercepTest.\nIn 87 lymphoma patients, the serum level of HER-2/neu ranged from 3.6 to 244.1 ng/ml (median 8.0 ng/ml). Only 2 patients showed a marginal or increased HER-2/neu level with 15 ng/ml (which is the upper limit of normal) and 244.1 ng/ml, respectively. No patient with diffuse large-cell lymphoma showed HER-2/neu overexpression by immunhistochemistry of the lymph node. The paraffin block of the one patient with a very high HER-2/neu serum level was also stained for HER-2/neu overexpression. In this patient, suffering from a high-grade T-cell non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma, no staining could be found.\nHER-2/neu is not overexpressed in non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma and especially not in diffuse large-cell lymphoma, using a standardized immunochemistry technique with complementary serum testing. Thus, specific anti-HER-2/neu-targeted therapy should play no role in the treatment of non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma.","title":"Lack of HER-2/neu overexpression in non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma.","pubmedId":"15510616"}
