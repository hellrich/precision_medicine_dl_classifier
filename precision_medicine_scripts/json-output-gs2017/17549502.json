The interactions between the BRCA2 and the RAD51 recombinase are essential for DNA repair by homologous recombination, failure of which can predispose to cancer. The availability of genetic tests for BRCA gene mutations prompted cancer geneticists to give information about genetic risk and to assess many women with a personal or family history of breast cancer to inform them of preventive measures. However, the knowledge on the complex, recombination, between BRCA2- RAD51 is limited.\nHere, the author performs an analysis to study the molecular structure of human BRCA2-RAD51 complex.\nThe output 3D molecular structure from the combination between BRCA2-RAD51 is derived.\nThe property as well as geometry of the derived complex was also presented.","title":"Structure of human BRCA2-RAD51 by molecular docking study.","pubmedId":"17549502"}
