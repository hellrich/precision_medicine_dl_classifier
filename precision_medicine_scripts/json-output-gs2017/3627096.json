No adverse effects were observed in this patient after operation. The resected specimen of the lung had the bronchioli partially accompanied with cartilages. Coagulation for the bronchioli of at least lmm in size, by MTC, could be carried out resulting in no air leakage after operation.","title":"[Pulmonary resection by microwave tissue coagulator (MTC)--clinical application].","pubmedId":"3627096"}
