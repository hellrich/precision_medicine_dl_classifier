Among 40 cases of pancreatic cancer, elevated values were observed for immunoreactive elastase (IRE) in 70% and for CA19-9 in 73%. Elevated serum IRE was observed more frequently in head cancer and resectable cancer, whereas elevation in CA19-9 occurred more often in body-tail cancer and unresectable cancer. Elevation of serum IRE and CA19-9 are useful for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer but it is not specific for pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we studied the clinical usefulness of a combination assay of various serum markers such as CA19-9, lipase, serum iron, amylase, albumin globulin ratio, tissue polypeptide antigen, immunoreactive trypsin, and CA125 using the logistic regression analysis. This assay showed higher sensitivity and high specificity for pancreatic cancer than CA19-9. This combination assay may be very useful for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.","title":"[Early detection of pancreatic cancer by serum markers].","pubmedId":"7511183"}
