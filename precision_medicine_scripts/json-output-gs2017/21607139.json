As radical resection offers a poor success rate and limited effective adjuvant modalities exist in its advanced stage, the disease leads to a fairly poor prognosis. As the incidence of CCA is increasing, although the mortality rate remains stable, and few other definite etiologies have yet to be established, renewing our knowledge of its fundamental carcinogenesis is advisable. The latest advances in molecular carcinogenesis have highlighted the roles of epigenetic perturbations and cancer-related inflammation in CCA. This review focuses on the reciprocal effects between aberrant DNA methylation and inflammatory microenvironment in CCA.","title":"Aberrant DNA methylation profile in cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"21607139"}
