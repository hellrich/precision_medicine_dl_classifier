Previous work has shown that mutational inactivation of the STK11 pathway may serve as a predictive biomarker for cancer treatments, including phenformin and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition. Although immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and diagnostic sequencing are used to measure STK11 pathway disruption, there are serious limitations to these methods, thus emphasizing the importance of validating a clinically useful assay.\nAn initial STK11 mutation mRNA signature was generated using cell line data and refined using three large, independent patient databases. The signature was validated as a classifier using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD cohort as well as a 442-patient LUAD cohort developed at Moffitt. Finally, the signature was adapted to a NanoString-based format and validated using RNA samples isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks corresponding to a cohort of 150 patients with LUAD. For comparison, STK11 IHC staining was also performed.\nThe STK11 signature was found to correlate with null mutations identified by exon sequencing in multiple cohorts using both microarray and NanoString formats. Although there was a statistically significant correlation between reduced STK11 protein expression by IHC staining and mutation status, the NanoString-based assay showed superior overall performance, with a -0.1588 improvement in area under the curve in receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis (p \u003c 0.012).\nThe described NanoString-based STK11 assay is a sensitive biomarker to study emerging therapeutic modalities in clinical trials.","title":"A Sensitive NanoString-Based Assay to Score STK11 (LKB1) Pathway Disruption in Lung Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26917230"}
