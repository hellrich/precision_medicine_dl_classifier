FISH probes were used for chromosome loci of APC (see glossary at end of article for expansion of all gene symbols), BRCA2, CTNNB1, EGFR, ERBB2, CDKN2A, TP53, TYMP, and TYMS. These FISH probes were used with control probes to distinguish among various kinds of chromosome abnormalities of number and structure.\nFISH abnormalities were observed in 12 (80%) of 15 patients with pancreatic cancer: 5 of 5 patients with acinar cell carcinoma, 5 of 5 patients with ductal adenocarcinoma, and 2 (40%) of 5 patients with islet cell carcinoma. All 3 specimens of pancreatic tissue without neoplasia had normal FISH results. Gains of CTNNB1 due to trisomy 3 occurred in each tumor with acinar cell carcinoma but in none of the other tumors in this study. FISH abnormalities of all other cancer genes studied were observed in all forms of pancreatic tumors in this investigation.\nFISH abnormalities of CTNNB1 due to trisomy 3 were observed only in acinar cell carcinoma. FISH abnormalities of genes implicated in familial cancer, tumor progression, and the 5-fluorouracil pathway were common but were not associated with specific types of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization to visualize genetic abnormalities in interphase cells of acinar cell carcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma, and islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"19720778"}
