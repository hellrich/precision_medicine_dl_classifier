Apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labelling assay.\nA total of 70 patients with PDAC had samples available; 49 cases (70.0%) had high PUMA protein levels. PUMA was not detected in paired normal tissue samples. Significantly higher levels of PUMA protein were detected in low-grade tumours (tumour -node-metastasis stages I and II), compared with higher grade (stage III) tumours. Of the PDAC cases, the mean apoptosis index value for PUMA-positive specimens was significantly higher than that for PUMA-negative specimens. Overall survival was significantly associated with PUMA immunoreactivity.\nHigh levels of PUMA in PDAC tumour cells suggest that PUMA expression may play a role in pancreatic tumourigenesis.","title":"Prognostic significance of PUMA in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23321162"}
