Numerous studies suggest that GM-CSF signaling plays a central role in establishing and maintaining JMML/MP-CMML phenotypes in human and mouse. However, it remains elusive how GM-CSF signaling impacts on JMML/MP-CMML initiation and progression. Here, we investigate this issue in a well characterized MP-CMML model induced by endogenous Nras(G12D/+) mutation. In this model, Nras(G12D/+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are required to initiate and maintain CMML phenotypes and serve as CMML-initiating cells. We show that the common β chain of the GM-CSF receptor (βc) is dispensable for Nras(G12D/+) HSC function; loss of βc does not affect the expansion, increased self-renewal, or myeloid differentiation bias in Nras(G12D/+) HSCs. Therefore, βc(-/-) does not abrogate CMML in Nras(G12D/+) mice. However, βc deficiency indeed significantly reduces Nras(G12D/+)-induced splenomegaly and spontaneous colony formation and prolongs the survival of CMML-bearing mice, suggesting that GM-CSF signaling plays an important role in promoting CMML progression. Together, our results suggest that inhibiting GM-CSF signaling in JMML/MP-CMML patients might alleviate disease symptoms but would not eradicate the disease.
