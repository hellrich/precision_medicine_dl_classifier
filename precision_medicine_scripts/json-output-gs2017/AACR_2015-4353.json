In fact, first generation commercial multiparametric test assays show promising results. We hypothesized that such tests may be further optimized.Design: A tissue microarray (TMA) containing 0.6 mm tissue cores from more than 12,000 prostate cancer patients with long-term follow-up data was analyzed with more than 100 molecular markers by immunohistochemistry or FISH. Markers with strong and independent prognostic value in uni- and multivariate analyses were combined to obtain panels of markers that yield additional prognostic information beyond the standard parameters (including pre-operative PSA, Gleason grade, tumor stage, nodal stage) in ROC analysis. For this purpose, a simple score (0-10 points) was build based on the number and type of adverse features per tumor.Results: Markers with strong independent prognostic relevance included deletions of 6q15 and PTEN, overexpression of EZH2, TUBB3, and nuclear accumulation of p53, indicating dominant-negative TP53 gene mutation. A total of 5,129 cancers harbored none of these alterations (score 0) and showed the best prognosis in a Kaplan-Meier plot using biochemical recurrence as the study endpoint. The worst prognosis was found for 610 tumors harboring 8 (score 8-10) of these alterations, while an intermediate prognosis with decreasing time to recurrence was found for cancers with scores 1-2 (n \u003d 2,418), 3-4 (n \u003d 1,367) and 5-7 (n \u003d 1038). The differences between the groups were high significant (p\u003c0.0001). The 5 genes classifier provided prognostic information independent from PSA, Gleason, stage, and nodal stage (p\u003c0.0001).Conclusion: Multiparametric classifiers have a high potential to improve the predictive accuracy of current models using established clinic-pathological models. Analyses of very large sets of patient tissues are instrumental to identify the best candidates for such molecular marker panels. It is likely, that continued analysis of our TMA will identify even better marker panels than the current 5 genes classifier.","title":"Improved prediction of prostate cancer prognosis by using a multiparametric molecular classifier","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4353"}
