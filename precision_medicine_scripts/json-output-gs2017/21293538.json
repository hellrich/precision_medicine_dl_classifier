Lapatinib is the first dual inhibitor of HER1 (EGFR, ErbB1) and HER2 (ErbB2, Neu) tyrosine kinases to be used in clinical practice. However, only HER2 is currently used for therapy indications and new predictors for the treatment with lapatinib are sought.\nThis minireview focuses on lapatinib and its role in breast cancer treatment. Preclinical and clinical studies as well as pharmacological characteristics are briefly reviewed while the focus is on efficacy assessment including predictive factors for therapy outcome.\nLapatinib (Tykerb/Tyverb) was Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2007 for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer in patients who had received previous treatment (including anthracycline, taxane and trastuzumab containing regimens) and in 2010 for use in combination with letrozole for postmenopausal women with hormonal receptor positive and HER2- positive metastatic breast cancer. In contrast to trastuzumab (Herceptin), lapatinib is orally administered and it targets both HER2 and HER1 receptors. As a synthetic and oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), it is convenient, cheaper and easier to produce than monoclonal antibodies. The recommended dosage is not dependent on body weight either. Lapatinib plasma level measurement could be an approach to tailored therapy for further optimizing the dose and prolonging this efficient therapy. New lapatinib response predictors are being evaluated. At this time, only HER2 amplification/overexpression is used to choose lapatinib therapy candidates. Further studies on concurrent HER1 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)/immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment and/or microarray analyses may produce new data on the predictive role of the HER1 (EGFR) gene/protein. PTEN loss and PIK3CA gene mutations are other markers that may predict lapatinib poor response.","title":"Lapatinib in breast cancer - the predictive significance of HER1 (EGFR), HER2, PTEN and PIK3CA genes and lapatinib plasma level assessment.","pubmedId":"21293538"}
