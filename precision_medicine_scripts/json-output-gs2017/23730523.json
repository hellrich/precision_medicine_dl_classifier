Nab-paclitaxel (nab-P), an albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel, appears to decrease levels of cytidine deaminase, which is the primary gemcitabine catabolic enzyme, this likely increases sensitivity to GEM when these agents are combined. Here we present a case of a 52 year old female with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with elevated CA19-9 at diagnosis who received GEM + nab-P followed by GEM based chemoradiation who underwent surgical resection despite persistent stable disease on radiographic studies and was found to have complete pathologic response.","title":"Gemcitabine plus Nab-Paclitaxel with chemoradiation in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).","pubmedId":"23730523"}
