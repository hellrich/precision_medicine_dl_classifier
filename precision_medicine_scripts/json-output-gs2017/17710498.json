However, studies that directly compare the recurrence and histopathological features between the two groups are rare.\nClinicopathologic factors and the long-term outcomes of 163 patients with ampullary carcinoma after radical resection were retrospectively evaluated and compared with those of 91 patients with distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\nAmong the 163 ampullary carcinomas, T1 stage, well-differentiated tumors and perineural invasion were 45 (28%), 73 (45%), and 23 (14%), respectively, whereas, only five (6%) were T1 stage, 15 (17%) were well differentiated, and 63 (69%) showed perineural invasion (p \u003c 0.001, for all) in distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. More patients with distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma had liver metastasis than ampullary carcinoma (24% vs. 10%, p \u003d 0.004). Multivariate analysis identified venous invasion and perineural invasion as risk factors for recurrence of ampullary carcinoma after radical resection. Only lymph node involvement was identified as a risk factor for recurrence of distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by multivariate analysis. Overall five-year survival of patients with ampullary cancer was higher than that of patients with distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (68% vs. 54%; p \u003d 0.033). In patients without lymph node metastasis, a significant difference in survival was also observed between the two groups (p \u003d 0.049).\nEarlier diagnosis and the less frequent occurrence of pathological factors associated with tumor invasiveness in ampullary carcinoma than in distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma may explain its association with a better prognosis.","title":"Recurrence and prognostic factors of ampullary carcinoma after radical resection: comparison with distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"17710498"}
