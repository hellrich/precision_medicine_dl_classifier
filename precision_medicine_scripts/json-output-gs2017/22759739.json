In the subpopulation of patients with an unresectable meningioma and refractory to radiotherapy, hormonal chemotherapy-targeted therapy may be prescribed. Notwithstanding limited data, hydroxyurea, somatostatin analogues and interferon-α have been modestly successful in patients with recurrent meningiomas. Emerging targeted therapies, particularly angiogenic inhibitors, may prove useful in refractory meningiomas as recently demonstrated with sunitinib and novel somatostatin analogues.\nA number of challenges are apparent with respect to the use of chemotherapy or targeted therapy for intracranial meningioma. First, there is very limited published literature that provides compelling evidence from which to determine appropriate therapy. Second, there is a paucity of clinical trials for patients with recurrent meningioma. Third, there remains a lack of agreement or standardization as to what constitutes a meaningful response to medical therapy recognizing these metrics differ between low-grade and high-grade recurrent meningioma. As a consequence, there remains a significant unmet need in neuro-oncology for defining the role of chemotherapy or targeted therapy in recurrent meningioma.","title":"The role of chemotherapy and targeted therapy in the treatment of intracranial meningioma.","pubmedId":"22759739"}
