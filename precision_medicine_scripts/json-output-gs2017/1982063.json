Certain types of human tumors carry an amplified cellular oncogene at frequencies of up to 50-60%. Human neuroblastoma has been prototypic for the importance of oncogene amplification in tumorigenesis, and evidence is emerging that amplification may be an early event involved in a more malignant form of this cancer. It is unclear at which stage amplification plays a role in other cancers. Amplification of cellular oncogenes is a good predictor of clinical outcome in some human malignancies.","title":"Amplification of cellular oncogenes: a predictor of clinical outcome in human cancer.","pubmedId":"1982063"}
