The complex\u0027s physicochemical properties were systemically investigated in terms of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared absorption spectroscopy (IR). In vivo and in vitro antitumor studies, CUB-PLC-BER and the unmodified cucurbitacin B-phospholipid complex (CUB-PLC) presented stronger antitumor efficacy against human cholangiocarcinoma cells (QBC939 cells) than free cucurbitacin B (CUB), while phospholipids (PL) itself had no significant toxicity. Besides that, CUB-PLC showed the advantage over the free CUB and CUB-PLC-BER with regard to the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo antitumor study. Failure to establish the orthotopic CC model, the study attempted to measure the level of CUB in plasma and in bile to explore bile duct-targeted effect indirectly. In the pharmacokinetics study in rats, the average values of Cmax and AUC0-8h of CUB-PLC-BER group in rat bile were higher than those of CUB-PLC, while an opposite result was found in plasma. Meanwhile, the Cmax, AUC0-8h and AUC0-24h of CUB were the least both in plasma and in bile. The results indicated that the CUB-PLC-BER tended to provide a high and prolonged drug concentration to bile duct, and PL played a central role in internalizing CUB into cells to improve the water insoluble drug\u0027s permeability, which was of great benefit to enhance the bioavailability of CUB and improve therapeutic efficacy of CC. These results elucidated the potential of CUB-PLC-BER as drug delivery system for improving bile duct-targeted and therapeutic efficacy for CC.
