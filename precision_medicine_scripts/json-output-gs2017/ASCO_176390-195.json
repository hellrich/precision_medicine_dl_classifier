However, its efficacy is limited in non-responders and there is no reliable clinical parameter in predicting treatment response. We aim to identify chemoradiation-resistant cancers and avoid unnecessary treatments in non-responders with mutation analysis. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from diagnostic biopsy specimens of 20 patients (10 with good and 10 with poor response) with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy. Using next-generation sequencing, we screened mutation hotspots in 46 cancer-related genes (Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel). Potential predictive genetic variations were validated in another cohort of patients. Chemoradiotherapy response was based on pathological evaluation of surgically resected specimens. The prognostic significance of genetic variations was evaluated with Cox regression survival analysis. Results: In the first cohort, we discovered PIK3CA H1047R and STK11 F354L as potential targets to predict chemoradiation resistance. Next, we investigate these genetic variations in another 54 patients. Altogether, 18.9% (14/74) and 6.8% (5/74) of patients had PIK3CA H1047R and STK11 F354L, respectively. In patients with poor response to chemoradiotherapy, 45.8% (11/24) had either PIK3CA H1047R or STK11 F354L; compared to 12.0% (6/50) in patients with good response (p \u003d 0.001). In other words, 64.7% of patients with either one genetic variation responded poorly to chemoradiotherapy. In survival analysis, the 5-yr survival rates were 7.7% and 43.7% in patients with either one genetic variation and those without, respectively (p \u003d 0.003). In multivariable analysis, the presence of either one genetic variation was a significant prognostic factor for overall survival (Hazard ratio: 2.43, 95% confidence interval: 1.195-4.944, p\u003d 0.014). Conclusions:PIK3CA H1047R and STK11 F354L mutations are associated with poor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and worse prognosis in esophageal cancer. It may potentially be biomarkers to guide treatment decisions.","title":"Association of PIK3CA H1047R and STK11 F354L mutations with response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and survival in esophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_176390-195"}
