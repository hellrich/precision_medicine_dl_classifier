The staging system of c-TNM is more important than p-TNM when deciding treatment modality for lung cancer. Compared to other solid cancers, neoadjuvant therapy in lung cancer treatment has a more important position. A clinical protocol study should be carried out with the idea of \"intent to treat\" and medical oncology will play a more important role in the treatment of lung cancer.","title":"[Lung cancer].","pubmedId":"9987497"}
