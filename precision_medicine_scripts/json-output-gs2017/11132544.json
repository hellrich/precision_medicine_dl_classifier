In functionally inoperable patients radiation therapy offers the second best changes. However, in cases of severe emphysema with severely limited lung function even conventional radiation therapy is prohibited because of possible fibrotic reactions of the lung parenchyma. For such patients high dose rate stereotactic one-time radiation therapy may be an option. According to the study protocol of the DKFZ Heidelberg a dose rate of 24 Gy at the iso-center is applied with the linear accelerator in a single session. The recognisable tumour is irradiated with 22 Gy (90% isodose included). 20 Gy are applied to the tumour plus 6 millimeters safety margin. Prerequisites of such a therapy are a detailed computer-based planning using CT scans and an exact positioning with immobilisation of the patient. The irradiation is ideally performed under general anesthesia with high-frequency jetventilation to avoid movements due to breathing. We report on this new therapeutic modality in a patient with lung emphysema having a T2 tumour.","title":"[High-dose, stereotactic, one-time radiotherapy with curative intent for peripheral lung cancer].","pubmedId":"11132544"}
