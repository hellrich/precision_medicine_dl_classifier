ERG rearrangements and PTEN deletions were detected in 41.9 and 42.6% of patients\u0027 tumours, respectively. ERG rearrangements were never detected in benign prostate tissue, while PTEN aberrations were present at a basal level of 4.6%. PTEN hemizygous deletions showed higher frequency than homozygous deletions within each diagnostic category from benign prostate tissue to HGPIN and PCA (P ≤ 0.001). Furthermore, in 29 patients where all three tissues were available, PTEN genomic aberrations in PCA were significantly different from those in benign tissue (P \u003d 0.005) and HGPIN (P \u003d 0.02), reflecting the accumulation of genomic aberrations in the early stages of disease progression. Within this cohort, 71.4% of homozygous and 44.2% of hemizygous PTEN deletions occurred simultaneously with ERG rearrangements (P ≈ 0). Stratified according to Gleason score (GS), hemizygous PTEN deletions across various GS groups were observed at a higher frequency than homozygous deletions. However, PTEN homozygous deletions showed positive trends with higher GS, increasing in poorly differentiated PCA (GS 8-10) in comparison to moderately and well differentiated tumours (GS 6 and 7).\nWe show significant association between ERG gene rearrangements and PTEN genomic aberrations in subset of PCA. Our analysis also provides further support for the observation that homozygous PTEN deletions can occur within the subset of HGPIN lesions, and shows accumulating genetic aberrations with disease progression, evidenced by higher detection in PCA than in HGPIN and more PTEN homozygous deletions in GS 8-10 than in 6-7.","title":"PTEN genomic deletion is an early event associated with ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"20590547"}
