Recent genome-wide genotyping and exome sequencing studies have confirmed the pivotal role of NF2 in meningioma tumorigenesis, concerning roughly half of the tumors, and unraveled new mutations in non-NF2 meningiomas concerning AKT1, SMO, KLF4 and TRAF7. The molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis of high histological grades have been progressively deciphered with the recent discovery of TERT promoter mutations in progressing tumors. A better understanding of the genetics and clinical behavior of high-grade meningiomas is mandatory in order to better design future clinical trials. New genetically engineered mouse models of benign and histologically aggressive meningioma represent a substantial resource for the establishment of relevant pre-clinical trials. By studying the mechanisms underlying these new tumorigenesis pathways and the corresponding mouse models, we should be able to offer personalized chemotherapy to patients with surgery- and radiation-refractory meningiomas in the near future.","title":"Molecular genetics of meningiomas: Building the roadmap towards personalized therapy.","pubmedId":"25245924"}
