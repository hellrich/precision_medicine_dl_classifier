We report a case of metastatic melanoma of the pancreas in a 35-year-old woman presenting with a solid mass of the pancreas. Her past medical history included a radical hysterectomy 2 years previously for malignant melanoma of the vagina. Twelve months later, lung metastasis was also resected. EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) identified that the pancreatic tumor was histologically and immunohistochemically identical to the surgical specimen of her lung neoplasm. Imaging studies including US, CT, and MRI have limited value to distinguish the tumors from primary ductal adenocarcinoma. EUS-FNA can provide tissue diagnosis from pancreatic masses, specifically when other modalities have failed.","title":"[Pancreatic metastasis of malignant melanoma diagnosed by EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)].","pubmedId":"17611386"}
