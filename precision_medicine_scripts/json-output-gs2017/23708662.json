Tumor-suppressor genes phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (Pten) and androgen upregulated gene 19 (U19), which encodes ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2), are frequently inactivated or downregulated in advanced prostate cancers. Previous studies showed that EAF2 knockout caused tumors in multiple organs and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in mice. However, EAF2-knockout mice did not develop prostate cancer even at 2 years of age. To further define the roles of EAF2 in prostate carcinogenesis, we crossed the Pten+/- and EAF2+/- mice in the C57/BL6 background to generate EAF2-/-Pten+/-, Pten+/-, EAF2-/- and wild-type mice. The prostates from virgin male mice with the above four genotypes were analyzed at 7 weeks, 19 weeks and 12 months of age. Concomitant loss of EAF2 function and inactivation of one Pten allele induced spontaneous prostate cancer in 33% of the mice. Prostatic tissues from intact EAF2-/- Pten+/- mice exhibited higher levels of phospho-Akt, -p44/42 and microvessel density. Moreover, phospho-Akt remained high after castration. Consistently, there was a synergistic increase in prostate epithelial proliferation in both intact and castrated EAF2-/-Pten+/- mice. Using laser-capture microdissection coupled with real-time reverse transcription-PCR, we confirmed that co-downregulation of EAF2 and Pten occurred in \u003e50% clinical prostate cancer specimens with Gleason scores of 8-9 (n\u003d11), which is associated with poor prognosis. The above findings together demonstrated synergistic functional interactions and clinical relevance of concurrent EAF2 and Pten downregulation in prostate carcinogenesis.
