The ophthalmoscopic picture, fluorescein angiography, and overlying peculiar orange pigmentation were suggestive of a malignant lesion. Study of serial sections of the entire lesion made possible the histologic reconstruction of the lesion, clinicopathologic correlation of the yellow-orange pigment, and the location of the nevus and mixed spindle-cell melanoma components.","title":"Malignant melanoma arising in a choroidal magnacellular nevus (melanocytoma).","pubmedId":"1078332"}
