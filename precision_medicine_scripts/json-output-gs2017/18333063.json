Computed tomography (CT) showed a large tumour in the head and body of pancreas, and needle biopsy confirmed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Laparoscopy revealed liver metastases in both lobes, again histologically shown to be poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Six cycles of cisplatin, epirubicin and infusional 5-fluorouracil were given. Five years later the patient remains completely well. Repeat CT scans show a complete radiological response.\nPrevious studies using numerous chemotherapy regimes have not significantly altered the outcome of pancreatic cancer. To the best of our knowledge this is the longest surviving case of a patient with advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma (stage IV) of the pancreas treated with chemotherapy.","title":"Long-term survival with stage IV poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18333063"}
