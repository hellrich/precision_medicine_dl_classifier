Cystic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, mucinous cystic neoplasm, intraductal papillary neoplasm, and solid pseudopapillary neoplasm were categorized as neoplastic; pseudocysts and serous cysts were designated as nonneoplastic/low risk.\nFinal diagnoses were established by surgery in 154 patients (mucinous cystic neoplasm/intraductal papillary neoplasm [69.4%], pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor [10%], pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [6.4%], solid pseudopapillary neoplasm [0.6%], nonneoplastic/low risk [13.6%]). Endoscopic ultrasonography with or without FNA was superior to CT and MRI in accurately classifying a cyst as neoplastic (P \u003c 0.0001). After CT and MRI, EUS increased the rate of correctly predicting neoplastic cysts in 43 (36%) and 27 (54%) additional cases, respectively.\nThe incremental increase in diagnostic yield of EUS and fluid analysis over CT and MRI for prediction of a neoplastic cyst is 36% and 54%, respectively. The addition of EUS-FNA to abdominal imaging significantly increases overall accuracy for diagnosis of neoplastic pancreatic cysts.","title":"Should we do EUS/FNA on patients with pancreatic cysts?
