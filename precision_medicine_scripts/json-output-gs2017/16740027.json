GISTs exhibit activating mutations in the c-kit proto-oncogene, which render them amenable to treatment with imatinib mesylate. Consequently, correct identification of c-Kit expression is important for the diagnosis and treatment of GISTs.\nTo analyze CD117 immunohistochemical staining performance by a large number of clinical laboratories.\nA mechanical device was used to construct tissue microarrays consisting of 3 x 1-mm cores of 10 tumor samples, which can be used to generate hundreds of tissue sections from the arrayed cases, suitable for large-scale interlaboratory comparison of immunohistochemical staining.\nAn initial survey of 63 laboratories and a second survey of 90 laboratories, performed in 2004 and 2005, exhibited \u003e81% concordance for 7 of 10 cores, including all 4 GIST cases, which were immunoreactive for CD117 with \u003e95% staining concordance. Three of the cores achieved less than 81% concordance of results, possibly due to the presence of foci of necrosis in one core and CD117-positive mast cells in 2 cores of CD117-negative neoplasms.\nThere was good performance among a large number of laboratories performing CD117 immunohistochemical staining, with consistently higher concordance of results for CD117-positive GIST cases than for nonimmunoreactive cases. Tissue microarrays for CD117 and other predictive markers should be useful for interlaboratory comparisons, quality assurance, and education of participants regarding staining nuances such as the expression of CKIT by nonneoplastic mast cells.","title":"The CD117 immunohistochemistry tissue microarray survey for quality assurance and interlaboratory comparison: a College of American Pathologists Cell Markers Committee Study.","pubmedId":"16740027"}
