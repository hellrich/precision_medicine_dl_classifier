Eighty lesions, 20 each from colorectal adenoma, Tis, T1 and T2 cancers were evaluated immunohistochemically for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase) and MVD. MVD (p \u003d 0.0001) and bFGF expression (p \u003d 0.0001) increased in the order of adenoma, Tis, T1 and T2 cancers. VEGF expression was same in adenomas and cancers while dThdPase was weak in adenomas but strongly expressed in invasive carcinomas ( \u003e T1). MVD had positive correlation with tumour size in small (\u003c or \u003d 4 cm) colorectal cancers. Concurrent expression of AGFs was noticed in invasive carcinomas. bFGF seems to be the strongest among the three AGFs expressed during colorectal carcinogenesis and had a significant correlation with tumour MVD. Concurrent expression of multiple AGFs is a crucial step in the transition from non-invasive to invasive carcinoma.","title":"Concurrent expression of angiogenic growth factors and neovascularization during tumourigenesis in colorectal carcinoma patients.","pubmedId":"11669335"}
