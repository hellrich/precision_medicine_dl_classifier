Translocations involving the NTRK1/2/3 kinase domain, mutations involving the TRK ligand-binding site, amplifications of NTRK, TRK splice variants, and autocrine/paracrine signaling have been described in a diverse number of tumor types and may contribute to tumorigenesis. Recently NTRK1 fusions were described in a subset of adenocarcinoma lung cancer patients (Vaishnavi, 2013) and NTRK2 and NTRK3 fusions have been described in multiple tumor types (Skalova, 2014; Ricarte-Filho, 2013; Vaishnavi, 2014). LOXO-101 is a potent, oral, ATP-competitive pan-TRK inhibitor with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range for inhibition of TRK family members in binding and cellular assays, with 100x selectivity over other kinases. LOXO-101 has demonstrated tumor inhibition in preclinical models.  Methods:    This study (NCT02122913) is an ongoing phase Ia/Ib dose escalation plus expansion trial in adults with advanced solid tumors. The phase Ia component is an open-label, multicenter, dose escalation trial. Patients with solid tumors refractory to standard therapy, with normal hematopoietic and major organ function are eligible for study. LOXO-101 is administered orally QD or BID for continuous 28-day cycles. This component of the trial will determine the MTD for LOXO-101.   The phase Ib component is an open-label, multicenter, global, dose expansion study. In addition to the Phase Ia eligibility criteria, patients must have a demonstrated alteration in one of the three NTRK genes or three TRK proteins. The number of expansion cohorts will be determined by the molecular characteristics of the tumors in the patients enrolled. Data will provide initial evidence of tumor activity of LOXO-101, stratified by the type of NTRK or TRK alteration or tumor type, as well as further elucidation of the safety profile of LOXO-101 in cancer patients. Archival tissue is required for further characterization of molecular abnormalities.
