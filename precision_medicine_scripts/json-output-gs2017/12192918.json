The optimal management of obstructing left colonic carcinoma is still a controversial matter. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the indications for one-stage treatment of obstructing colorectal cancer. Over the period from January 1998 to June 2001, 17 patients were operated on in our department for obstructing colorectal cancer. Twelve patients underwent a one-stage emergency operation by immediate anastomosis without diversion, while five patients were managed palliatively. We performed resection and primary anastomosis following intraoperative irrigation in obstructing sigmoid cancer lacking colonic wall lesions, while subtotal colectomy was carried out in cases of massively distended colon with ischaemic lesions and in patients with good anal continence. Colostomy treatment was indicated only in high-risk patients with unresectable lesions. The authors believe that, in cases of obstructing left colorectal cancer, an experienced, skilled surgeon can perform one-stage resection and anastomosis on patients in good general condition. On the other hand, a defunctioning colostomy may be ideal for surgeons with little experience in colorectal surgery and in patients with a very poor prognosis.","title":"One-stage treatment of obstructing colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"12192918"}
