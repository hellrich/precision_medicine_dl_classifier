The authors undertook this study to assess the relationship between VS growth rates and patient age and type of constitutional NF2 mutation; they also examined variability in VS growth rates among multiple patients in families with NF2.\nGadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images obtained in 18 patients with inherited NF2 from 11 unrelated families were retrospectively analyzed. The patients had been observed for a median of 4 years. Volumes of the VSs were measured using a two-component box model (intrameatal and extrameatal parts measured separately). Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and Southern blot analysis were used to identify constitutional NF2 mutations. Growth rates of the VSs were highly variable, but tended to decrease with increasing patient age both at onset of signs or symptoms of NF2 (r2 \u003d 0.35, p \u003d 0.026) and at diagnosis (r2 \u003d 0.33, p \u003d 0.012). The VS growth rates did not vary significantly with the type of constitutional NF2 mutation or the number of non-VS cerebral or spinal tumors. The VS growth rates were highly variable within families and did not correspond to clinical indices of NF2 disease severity, such as patient age at symptom onset and the number of non-VS cerebral and spinal tumors.\nThe growth rates of VSs in patients with NF2 are highly variable, but tend to decrease with increasing patient age. Clinical treatment of multiple patients in families with NF2 cannot be based on the expectations of similar VS growth rates, even when other clinical aspects of disease severity are similar.","title":"Predictors of vestibular schwannoma growth in patients with neurofibromatosis Type 2.","pubmedId":"11838793"}
