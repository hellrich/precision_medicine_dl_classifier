At least four courses of chemotherapy consisting of alternation of two drug combinations were given: alternating cycles of etoposide and carboplatin (EC) with weekly administration of irinotecan and cisplatin (IP) at 3- or 4-week intervals.\nThe overall response rate was 81.8%. The median duration of survival and progression-free survival were 314 days and 144 days, respectively. Hematological toxicity was the main adverse event. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia were observed in 69.2, 25.6 and 23.1% of the patients, respectively. Severe diarrhea (10.8%) was remarkable during the IP regimen.\nThis novel alternating chemotherapy for patients with ED-SCLC showed moderate tumor efficacy and an acceptable safety profile.","title":"Combination chemotherapy of alternating etoposide and carboplatin with weekly administration of irinotecan and cisplatin in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23060575"}
