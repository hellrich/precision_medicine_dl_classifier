TC and AC carcinoid express to different extent NT and NT receptor proteins. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was expressed by 83% of the TC but not by the AC carcinoids. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was expressed by 33 and 100% of TC and AC carcinoids, respectively. NT-3 was expressed by 58% of the TC and 38% of AC carcinoids. TC carcinoids express high affinity NT receptors while 50% of the AC carcinoids express the TrkB receptor. Our results demonstrate that NGF/TrkA and BDNF/TrkB signaling need to be considered as regulatory pathways that may address survival, differentiation and/or aggressiveness of human pulmonary carcinoids. Contrarily to the BDNF/TrkB, expression of the NGF/TrkA signaling may overcome aggressiveness of carcinoid cells. NTs may be useful as markers in the clinic.","title":"Neurotrophin system expression in human pulmonary carcinoid tumors.","pubmedId":"16338793"}
