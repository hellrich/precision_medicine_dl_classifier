In 3 of the 5 patients, the esophageal cancer was preceded by a gastric cancer, and the intervals before the gastric cancer was detected were 34, 24, and 60 months. The gastric tube the had been reconstructed by the retrosternal rout was resected with a median sternotomy in cases 1 and 2. In case 3, since a liver and lung metastasis had been detected by routine examination, surgery was not performed. Cases 4 and 5 had an esophageal cancer associated with a simultaneous early gastric cancer located in the lesser curvature of the upper body. Thus, a esophagectomy and a partial gastrectomy were performed. Twenty-eight and 21 months later, respectively, an early gastric cancer was found at the stump of the gastric tube that had been reconstructed by the retrosternal route. Endoscopic laser therapy was subsequently employed for both patients. Because of these findings, the author have concluded that postoperative serial examination of the gastric tube are very important, since cases of a gastric tube cancer are increasing.","title":"[A carcinoma of the reconstructed gastric tube after a radical esophageal cancer operation].","pubmedId":"2250364"}
