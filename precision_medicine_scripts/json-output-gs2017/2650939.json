The results show that NIH 3T3 expressing these genes readily formed tumors after subcutaneous injection in nude mice. Spontaneous lymph node metastasis was observed after a first cycle of transfection in one animal inoculated with cells containing human melanoma N-ras oncogene, and in 95 per cent of the animals after the second and third rounds of transfection, indicating that the metastatic capacity was transferred. In all cases human N-ras oncogene was found in both the metastases and the associated tumors. No control NIH 3T3 cells formed tumors or metastases in nude mice, and NIH 3T3 cells transfected with cloned N-ras activated oncogene formed tumors in 100 per cent of injected mice, but no spontaneous metastases. Thus human activated N-ras gene may not be sufficient to confer metastatic behavior in nude mice and the metastatic ability of human melanoma DNA transfected cells may be due to, among other possibilities, expression of other gene sequences from melanoma DNA co-transfected with the N-ras oncogene, or to specific activated murine sequences switched on during the initial process of transfection.","title":"Transformed NIH 3T3 cells expressing human melanoma N-ras oncogene metastasize to lymph node in nude mice.","pubmedId":"2650939"}
