We aimed to characterize doxorubicin effects on MKP-1 and phospho-MAPKs in human breast cancers and to further study the clinical relevance of MKP-1 expression in this disease.\nDoxorubicin effects on MKP-1, phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), phospho-JNK (p-JNK), and phospho-p38 were assayed in a panel of human breast cancer cells by Western blot and in human breast cancer were assayed ex vivo by immunohistochemistry (n \u003d 50). MKP-1 expression was also assayed in a range of normal to malignant breast lesions (n \u003d 30) and in a series of patients (n \u003d 96) with breast cancer and clinical follow-up.\nMKP-1 was expressed at low levels in normal breast and in usual ductal hyperplasia and at high levels in in situ carcinoma. MKP-1 was overexpressed in approximately 50% of infiltrating breast carcinomas. Similar to what was observed in breast cancer cell lines, ex vivo exposure of breast tumors to doxorubicin down-regulated MKP-1, and up-regulated p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK, in the majority of cases. However, in a proportion of tumors overexpressing MKP-1, doxorubicin did not significantly affect MKP-1 or phospho-MAPKs. With regard to patient outcome, MKP-1 overexpression was an adverse prognostic factor for relapse both by univariate (P \u003c 0.001) and multivariate analysis (P \u003d 0.002).\nMKP-1 is overexpressed during the malignant transformation of the breast and independently predicts poor prognosis. Furthermore, MKP-1 is repressed by doxorubicin in many human breast cancers.","title":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 in human breast cancer independently predicts prognosis and is repressed by doxorubicin.","pubmedId":"19417026"}
