In this study, we sought to investigate the prognostic and therapeutic implications of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in pts with ABC. Methods: All pts with ABC analyzed for FGFR1 and/or FGFR2 gene amplification by FISH at the Vall d\u0027Hebron Molecular Pathology and Genomics Labs between 2010 and 2014 were included in the study. Amplificationwas defined asa geneto copy number controlratioof 2.2. Results:FGFR1 and FGFR2 gene amplifications were detected in 47/205 (22.9%) and 3/67 (4.5%) pts, respectively.No significant differences in clinicopathologic features were found according to FGFR1 gene status. FGFR1 gene amplification was not associated with poorer disease-free survival (DFS) (2.9 versus 4.2 years; p \u003d 0.097) or overall survival (OS) (8.6 versus 10.4 years; p \u003d 0.550), but it was associated with shorter time to progression during first-line hormonal therapy (3.3 versus 11.9 months; p \u003d 0.039). FGFR2 gene amplification was not associated with poorer DFS (1.4 versus 3.2 years; p \u003d 0.140), but it was associated with shorter OS (2.6 versus 10.2 years; p \u003d 0.002). The overall concordance rate of FGFR1 and FGFR2 gene amplification status in 16 and 13 pts with paired samples from the primary tumor and the metastatic site was high (87.5% and 100%, respectively). PIK3CA mutations were the most common genetic alteration detected in all pts (27.4%). The proportion of pts with FGFR1 gene amplification and PIK3CA mutation was 20%. A total of 25 pts (12.2%) included in the study were treated with FGFR inhibitors in a clinical trial, corresponding to 42.1% of all FGFR1-amplified pts, with an overall response rate of 12.9%. Conclusions:FGFR1 and FGFR2 gene amplifications have important prognostic and therapeutic implications for pts with ABC. Additional studies are needed to better define the role of FGFR2 gene amplification as well as the antitumor activity of FGFR inhibitors in ABC pts, especially in combination with endocrine therapy.","title":"Prognostic and therapeutic implications of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 1 and 2 gene amplifications in patients (pts) with advanced breast cancer (ABC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_166127-176"}
