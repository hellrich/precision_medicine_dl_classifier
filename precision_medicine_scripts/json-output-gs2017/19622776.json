We recently showed that progastrin depletion inhibited Wnt signaling and increased goblet cell differentiation of CRC cells. Here, we show that progastrin down-regulation restores the expression by CRC cells of the early secretory lineage marker Math-1/Hath-1 due to an inhibition of Notch signaling. This effect is mediated by a decreased transcription of the Notch ligand Jagged-1, downstream of beta-catenin/Tcf-4. Accordingly, recombinant progastrin sequentially activated the transcription of Wnt and Notch target genes in progastrin-depleted cells. In addition, restoration of Jagged-1 levels in these cells is sufficient to activate Tcf-4 activity, demonstrating the occurrence of a feedback regulation from Notch toward Wnt signaling. These results suggest that progastrin could be instrumental in maintaining the concomitant activation of Wnt and Notch pathways in CRC cells, further highlighting the interest of progastrin targeting for the clinical management of CRC.","title":"The wnt target jagged-1 mediates the activation of notch signaling by progastrin in human colorectal cancer cells.","pubmedId":"19622776"}
