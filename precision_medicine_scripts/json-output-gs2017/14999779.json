Different fractionation schedules, conventional and altered regimes, have been used in curative radiotherapy. Although contribution of biological markers on radio response has been evaluated, its unique influence on various radio fractionation schemes has not been accounted so far. Our study analyses a set of proteins that previously demonstrated radio response influence for their possible prognostic value in decision-making process between the respective fractionation schemes. Expression patterns of regulatory proteins such as p53, cyclin D1, p16, Cdk4, p21, Rb, bcl-2 and PCNA were determined by immunohistochemistry utilizing monoclonal antibodies in 125 patients who received curative radiotherapy dose. Among these 125 patients, 90 (72%) received altered fractionation, whereas 35 (28%) received conventional fractionation. p53 over-expression correlated with local treatment failure among the patients treated with conventional fractionation whereas cyclin D1 over-expression and p16 underexpression were associated with local treatment failure as well as overall survival in altered fractionation treated cases. Our findings suggest that wild-type p53 status may be an important parameter for achieving high local control in those patients undergoing conventional fractionation, where as intact p16 and cyclin D1 status may be beneficial for effective local control in patients who are treated with altered fractionation. Furthermore, it can be assumed that conventional fractionation employs p53-mediated apoptosis, whereas altered fractionation activates the functional G1 cell-cycle checkpoint for tumor growth suppression.","title":"p53, p16 and cyclin D1: molecular determinants of radiotherapy treatment response in oral carcinoma.","pubmedId":"14999779"}
