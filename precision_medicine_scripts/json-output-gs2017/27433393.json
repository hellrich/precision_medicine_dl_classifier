We investigated PIK3CA expression in gastric cancer and explored the relationships between the PIK3CA expression level and clinicopathological features as well as survival of the patients.\nWe examined PIK3CA expression in a tissue microarray of 178 gastric adenocarcinomas by immunohisto-chemistry and reviewed patients\u0027 medical records.\nIn our study, 112 of the 178 gastric cancer patients displayed positive PIK3CA expression. Overexpression of PIK3CA was correlated with low grade differentiation (P\u003d0.001), frequent lymphatic invasion (P\u003d0.032), and high T stage (P\u003d0.040). Patients with positive PIK3CA staining were more likely to display worse overall survival rate than those with negative PIK3CA staining, as determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test (P\u003d0.047) and a univariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model (hazard ratio\u003d1.832, P\u003d0.051).\nElevated PIK3CA expression was significantly correlated with tumor invasiveness, tumor phenotypes, and poor patient survival.","title":"Clinicopathological Significance of Elevated PIK3CA Expression in Gastric Cancer.","pubmedId":"27433393"}
