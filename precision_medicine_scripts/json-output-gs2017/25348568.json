The expression of HER-2 protein was studied by the immunohistochemical method, amplification of HER2 gene and centromere part of chromosome 17 (CEP17) - by the in situ chromogenic hybridization method. Moderate correlation (r\u003d0.38, p\u003c0.001) between the immunohistochemical status and HER2 gene amplification was detected. A relationship between TNM clinical morphological parameters and HER-2 protein content and chromosome 17 polysomia (for N parameter), HER-2 protein content, and HER2 gene amplification (for tumor histogenesis) was detected. The content of HER-2 protein and amplification of HER2 and CEP17 correlated with the clinical morphological parameters of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer.
