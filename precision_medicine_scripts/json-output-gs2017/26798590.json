RET fusion proteins are detected in about 2% of lung adenocarcinomas. Alectinib, a second generation ALK inhibitor, was shown to block growth of cells with RET fusions. Thus alectinib should be further evaluated within clinical trials in patients with RET fusion-positive adenocarcinomas of the lung.
