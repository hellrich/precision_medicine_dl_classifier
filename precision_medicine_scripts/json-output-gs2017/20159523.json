PDA-affected patients show a poor prognosis. The 5-year survival rate for PDA is 5% and has changed little over the past few decades. This has prompted extensive research to identify new agents that can be used for anticancer therapy. The only cytotoxic drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is gemcitabine, which offers marginal benefits to patients in terms of symptom control and prolongation of life. Various strategies like targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor pathway have been researched upon. But these strategies have not provided promising results and none of the FDA-approved targeted agents have added any substantial clinical benefit to gemcitabine except for a marginal benefit from erlotinib. This article discusses various possible new targets and new agents for the anticancer therapy for PDA.","title":"Novel targets for pancreatic cancer therapy.","pubmedId":"20159523"}
