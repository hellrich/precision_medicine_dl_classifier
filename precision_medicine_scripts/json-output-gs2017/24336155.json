However, its utility for EGFR and KRAS molecular testing has not been validated. Molecular testing was performed using the cell-transfer technique on both Papanicolaou-stained ethanol-fixed and Hema 3-stained air-dried smears from 32 fine-needle aspiration samples that had diagnoses of adenocarcinoma of the lung, and then was compared to the results of the corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. The molecular testing was successfully performed on 32 of 32 ethanol-fixed and 31 of 32 air-dried samples. The molecular results on ethanol-fixed and air-dried smears showed 100% agreement. There is 100% (32/32) agreement for the EGFR and 97% (31/32) agreement for the KRAS between the cell-transfer technique and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. One discrepant case was due to low percentage of tumor cells on the smears. Cell-transfer technique is a reliable alternative method for EGFR and KRAS testing if the cell blocks lack adequate cellularity.
