The control group consisted of 29 men, among whom were 15 patients with posthemorrhagic anemia. Blood samples were withdrawn for assessment of blood count, serum concentration of EPO, iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and ferritin. The assessment of all parameters was repeated after 3 months of therapy:\nPatients suffering from lung cancer were characterized by a lower hemoglobin level and higher level of EPO as compared with the control group. A significant negative correlation was found between hemoglobin level and EPO serum concentration in all groups of patients and in the control group. The strongest correlation was observed in the control group t \u003d -0.812. In each group of patients the serum level of EPO increased after treatment; although a significant increase was found only in surgically treated patients and patients after chemotherapy. After treatment the correlation between hemoglobin and EPO became stronger especially in the group of patients with small cell lung cancer.\n1. Patients with lung cancer are characterized by inappropriately low serum EPO levels when related to the degree of anemia, 2. The suppressive effect of lung cancer on EPO secretion depends on the histological type of the cancer (with the exception of small cell lung cancer). 3. The increase of EPO level after treatment seems to be caused not only by a decrease of hemoglobin concentration, but also by reduction of the tumor mass.","title":"[Plasma erythropoietin concentration in lung cancer patients].","pubmedId":"12518622"}
