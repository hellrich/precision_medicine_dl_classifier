Mice bearing mammary tumors were randomly assigned to receive daily 40 mg/kg s.c. injections of this compound (experimental group, n \u003d 6) or vehicle (control group, n \u003d 6) per day for 5.5 weeks. Treatment with the compound significantly reduced the mammary tumor mean growth rate in the experimental group (-0.7 mm3/day), as compared with the control group (+28.2 mm3/day; P \u003c 0.001). There was a significant difference in lymphoma incidence at the end of the treatment between the experimental (0 of 6) and the control (3 of 6) groups (P \u003c 0.05). Therefore, this compound is effective in treating in vivo mammary carcinomas and lymphomas in which an activated N-Ras pathway drives tumorigenesis. The number of apoptotic figures in mammary tumors was significantly higher (P \u003d 0.04) in the experimental (14.7 +/- 8.1) than it was in the control (5.7 +/- 3.5) group, indicating that apoptotic induction could contribute to the mechanism of antitumor activity of this compound. We analyzed the level of processing of N-Ras and H-Ras after immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of protein extracts obtained from mammary tumors treated with L-744,832 or vehicle, either in vivo or in vitro (after primary culture of the same tumors), and from several in vitro treated control cell lines. In all compound-treated mammary tumors and cell lines, H-Ras was mostly unprocessed (more so after in vitro than after in vivo treatment), whereas N-Ras remained mostly processed. Both H-Ras and N-Ras remained fully processed in all vehicle-treated samples. These findings are consistent with a less intense antineoplastic effect of the treatment with the compound in our N-ras model than the effect previously reported for the same compound in H-ras transgenics. In addition, the finding that, in compound-treated mammary tumors, the N-Ras protein remains mainly processed suggests that, in our model, other proteins in addition to Ras may be a target for the compound. Our results and the previous findings of frequent N-ras activation in human hematopoietic malignancies support a role for L-744,832 in the treatment of lymphomas and of mammary carcinomas with an activated N-Ras pathway, as well as the testing of a farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor in humans to establish its clinical relevance.","title":"Antitumor effect of a farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor in mammary and lymphoid tumors overexpressing N-ras in transgenic mice.","pubmedId":"9515813"}
