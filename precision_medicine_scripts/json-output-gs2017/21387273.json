However, clinicopathological findings of KRAS mutated adenocarcinoma cases have not yet been fully clarified. The authors analyzed the relationship between the KRAS mutation and corresponding clinicopathological findings, focusing on nonmucinous and mucinous bronchioloalveolar elements.\nEGFR and KRAS mutations were detected in DNA samples extracted from 182 surgically resected tissues of lung adenocarcinomas by the Smart Amplification Process. The relations between gene mutation status and clinicopathological features were analyzed. All adenocarcinoma cases were divided into bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features, and adenocarcinoma without BAC components (non-BAC). BAC/adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features tumors were further assessed for the presence of mucinous features.\nEGFR and KRAS mutations were found in 76 and 30 cases, respectively. In the KRAS mutant group, BAC/adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features was found in 22 cases, which included 10 nonmucinous and 12 mucinous tumors. Of 19 cases with mucinous BAC/adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features, KRAS mutations were detected in 12, but no EGFR mutation was detected. In the KRAS mutant group, BAC/adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features had significantly earlier pathological stages and more favorable prognoses than did non-BAC. Mucinous BAC/adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features showed less smoking history than did nonmucinous BAC/adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features and non-BAC. Furthermore, transversion type KRAS mutations were more common in non-BAC.\nKRAS mutated adenocarcinomas can be divided into BAC/adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features and non-BAC types. Non-BAC adenocarcinoma is related to smoking history and has a poor prognosis. BAC/adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features adenocarcinoma, however, has a more favorable prognosis, and mucinous BAC/adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features has little relationship to smoking history.","title":"Clinicopathological features of lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutations.","pubmedId":"21387273"}
