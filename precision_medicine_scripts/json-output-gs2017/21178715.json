We report five cases of patients with a never-smoking adenocarcinoma of the lung with such a pattern of metastases. In the tumor cells of all five patients, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation gene sequencing identified a deletion in exon 19 of the EGFR gene, and all five patients had a dramatic response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. No echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation was detected. We believe that the miliary never-soking adenocarcinoma of the lung is a distinct clinically relevant subgroup of the never-smoking non-small cell lung cancer. Physician should recognize this subgroup of patients with lung cancer when facing a picture of miliary pulmonary metastases in chest x-ray or computed tomography scan in patients with a history of never smoking and consider upfront therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","title":"Miliary never-smoking adenocarcinoma of the lung: strong association with epidermal growth factor receptor exon 19 deletion.","pubmedId":"21178715"}
