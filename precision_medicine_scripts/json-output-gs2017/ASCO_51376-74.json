Determining the presence of these molecular abnormalities can direct the care of individual patients, qualify them for clinical trials, and aid research. To acquire this information on as many patients as feasible, in JAN 2009 our multidisciplinary Disease Management Team began a program (the Lung Cancer Mutation Analysis Project - LC-MAP), to prospectively detect all recurrent mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, HER2, PIK3CA, MEK1 and AKT1 and the EML4-ALK fusion gene in all patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with sufficient tissue. Methods: Patients sign an institutional consent to permit the use of previously obtained (\"leftover\") tissue for mutation profiling after standard morphologic and molecular diagnostic studies are complete. After PCR-based testing for EGFR exon 19 deletions and L858R, KRAS mutations are determined by direct sequencing, then remaining DNA is studied in a multiplexed mass-spectrometry-based system (Sequenom) to study 40 additional mutations in 7 genes. The EML4-ALK translocation is assayed by ALK FISH. Results: In the first six months, 301 patients entered the program. We completed all proposed testing in 92%. Mutations detected include 72 KRAS, 63 EGFR, 22 EML4-ALK, 1 BRAF, 4 PIK3CA, 0 HER2, 0 AKT1, and 0 MEK1. Based on this information, 27 patients with EGFR mutations received an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. No patient with wild type EGFR or a KRAS mutation received an EGFR TKI. 24 patients were entered on clinical trials testing agents targeting the specific molecular abnormality detected. Conclusions: (1) The presence of relevant mutations can be routinely determined in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung. (2) The mutational data obtained can be used to select erlotinib or gefitinib for individuals with EGFR mutations and to identify patients appropriate for clinical trials of targeted therapies. (3) This effort supports making upfront genotyping of lung adenocarcinomas part of routine care.
