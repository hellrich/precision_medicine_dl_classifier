The outcome of these patients was retrospectively assessed in correlation with ERCC1 expression.\nIncreased expression of ERCC1 correlates with a better prognosis of cervical cancer. The 2-year overall survival was 68.6% in the group with low H-score for ERCC-1 and gradually increased in the intermediate and high H-score groups to 71.7% and 90.7%, respectively.\nThe present study did not confirm the correlation of low levels of ERCC1 expression with unfavorable outcomes of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with platin-based radiochemotherapy.","title":"ERCC1 expression as a predictive marker of cervical cancer treated with cisplatin-based chemoradiation.","pubmedId":"24403494"}
