Whilst changes in blood lipids are well recognised in heart disease, little is known of their role in large bowel cancer. This study investigates serial alterations in blood lipids in the 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) rat model of colon cancer. Eighty Wistar rats received a 5 weekly regimen of DMH. At week 10, and at 5 weekly intervals until week 40, random groups of 10 rats were killed and blood taken for total and free cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides and liver enzymes. All colonic neoplasms were histologically classified either as adenomas or carcinomas with groups being allocated into tumour-free (n \u003d 16) or tumour-bearing (n \u003d 54), the latter group being further sub-divided into animals with adenoma alone (n \u003d 8) and those with carcinoma (n \u003d 46). Results were considered both sequentially and according to tumour status. Sequential results showed that with increase in colonic neoplasms with time there were accompanying increases in free and % free cholesterol and in phospholipids (P less than 0.001). There were no changes in total cholesterol, triglycerides or liver enzymes. Results according to tumour status showed that whilst there was no difference in total cholesterol or triglycerides between tumour-free and tumour-bearing rats, there was a significant increase in free (P less than 0.01) and % free cholesterol (P less than 0.001) and a decrease in phospholipids in the tumour-bearing animals (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in any serum lipid between tumour-free and adenoma-bearing rats. In animals with carcinoma, while there was no difference in total cholesterol or triglycerides, there was an increase in free (P less than 0.005) and % free cholesterol (P less than 0.001) and a decrease in phospholipids (P less than 0.001) compared to tumour-free rats. The data show for the first time a clear relationship between blood lipids and the presence or absence of large bowel cancer.","title":"Changes in serum lipids related to the presence of experimental colon cancer.","pubmedId":"3689662"}
