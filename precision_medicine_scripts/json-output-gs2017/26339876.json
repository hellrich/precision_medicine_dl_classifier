Abnormal laboratory studies depicted hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. A CT scan of the chest revealed a 3Ã—3 cm tumor in the anterior mediastinum. The pathology was consistent with a thymic carcinoid. These findings led to a diagnosis of biochemical Cushing\u0027s syndrome secondary to ectopic secretion of ACTH. Thus, this patient suffered twice of Cushing\u0027s syndrome. The first instance was the consequence of an ACTH--secreting pituitary adenoma and the second of an ectopic secretion of ACTH. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such case reported in the medical literature.","title":"[ACTH\u0027s ectopic secretion in a patient with precedents of Cushing\u0027s disease].","pubmedId":"26339876"}
