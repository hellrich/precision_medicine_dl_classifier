The EGFR axis is activated by a variety of ligands that are crucial in the formation and propagation of many tumors, including colorectal cancer, through their effects on cell signaling pathways, cellular proliferation, control of apoptosis, and angiogenesis. The importance of the EGFR axis in tumorigenesis and tumor progression makes it an attractive target for the development of anticancer therapies. A variety of targeting strategies to exploit the role of EGFR in tumors have been employed. The most highly developed of these anti-EGFR approaches are the monoclonal antibodies and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Clinical evaluations of these compounds have yielded some promising results. The role of the EGFR axis in colorectal cancer formation and progression is reviewed and the clinical development of these anticancer EGFR-targeted drugs is reviewed and updated.","title":"The epidermal growth factor receptor as a target for colorectal cancer therapy.","pubmedId":"15726506"}
