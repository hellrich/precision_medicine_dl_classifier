The factors responsible for these differences remain unclear. In this study, measures of blood glucose control, including birth weight percentile and the presence of factors potentially influencing fetal pulmonary maturation, such as diabetic class, maternal chronic hypertension, and preeclampsia, were compared with the amniotic fluid lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol within a group of 90 diabetic pregnancies. The factors were evaluated in combination with the techniques of canonical correlation and multiple regression analysis. Gestational age had the strongest effect in determining levels of amniotic fluid phospholipids, and hypertension was found to significantly accelerate the appearance of phosphatidylgycerol (p less than 0.05). The effect of hypertension was one third as important as that of gestational age. Neither diabetic blood glucose control, White classification, nor the remaining explanatory variables were found to play a significant role in determining the amniotic fluid phospholipid levels. This study suggests that, in the clinical management of diabetes, gestational duration remains the single most important determinant of amniotic fluid phospholipid levels.","title":"What affects fetal pulmonary maturation during diabetic pregnancy?","pubmedId":"6385716"}
