All underwent MR imaging, assessing lipomatous content, septation, and nodules. The associations between these features and tumor diagnosis based on morphology and the presence or absence of MDM2 amplification were explored. The age of the patient and the size and location of the lesion were also recorded for statistical analysis.\nOf the 87 patients, 54 were classified as lipomas and 33 as ALT/WDL. MR identified ALT/WDL with a sensitivity of 90.9 % (CI 74.5-97.6) and a specificity of 37.0 % (CI 24.6-51.3). The positive and negative predictive values were 46.9 % (CI 34.5-59.7) and 86.9 % (CI 65.3-96.6), respectively. The mean age of patients with ALT/WDL was greater (60 years [range 40-83 years]) than those with lipoma (52 years [range 10-79 years]) (p \u003d 0.025). The mean size of ALT/WDL (18.7 cm [range 5-36 cm]) was significantly greater than lipoma (13.9 cm [range 3-32 cm]) (p \u003d 0.003). Features that increased the likelihood of ALT/WDL included: patient age over 60 years, maximal lesion dimension over 10 cm, location in lower limb, and presence of non-fatty areas, by a factor of 2.61-6.25 times.\nALT/WDL and lipoma have overlapping MR imaging characteristics. The most reliable imaging discriminators of ALT/WDL were size of lesion and lipomatous content, but due to the overlap in the MRI appearances of lipoma and ALT/WDL, discrimination should be based on molecular pathology rather than imaging.","title":"MRI characteristics of lipoma and atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma: retrospective comparison with histology and MDM2 gene amplification.","pubmedId":"22987247"}
