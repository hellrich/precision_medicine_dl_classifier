Following treatment with standard doublet chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin), patients received oral sunitinib (starting dose 50mg/day) in 6-week cycles (Schedule 4/2: 4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off treatment) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was probability of survival at 1 year â‰¥55%. Of 84 patients who received first-line chemotherapy, 66 (79%) received sunitinib maintenance therapy (median sunitinib cycles started: 2 [range 1-20]). Probability of survival at 1 year was 40.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.8, 51.0). Median overall survival was 10.4 months (95% CI: 8.0, 12.2). The objective response rate was 27.4% (95% CI: 18.2, 38.2). The most frequently reported all-causality adverse events of any grade during sunitinib maintenance therapy were fatigue/asthenia (55%), diarrhea (36%), and nausea (32%). These data suggest that maintenance therapy may have value in NSCLC, although the primary endpoint of the study was not met.","title":"Phase II study of sunitinib as maintenance therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21680048"}
