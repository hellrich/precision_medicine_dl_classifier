This tumor typically presents in late adult life, most commonly in the retroperitoneum, extremities, or spermatic cord. It has been reported that the dedifferentiated component consists mainly of high-grade sarcoma, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and myxofibrosarcoma, and it has been recently reported that the dedifferentiated component can be also made up of a low-grade sarcomatous component. Therefore, the dedifferentiated areas exhibit a wide morphological spectrum that commonly includes fibroblastic/myofibroblastic and fibrohistiocytic tumors but very rarely includes vascular tumors. We present here the first reported case of DDLPS with a hemangioendothelioma-like component in the spermatic cord.
