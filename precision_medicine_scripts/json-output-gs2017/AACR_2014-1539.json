These events are commonly generated by breaking and re-joining the segments on either inter- or intra-chromosomal locations, creating an error within DNA repair mechanism responsible for oncogenic properties and, one of the reasons, causing cancer. Also, alteration in the programing of gene regulation changes the transcriptome structure resulting pathological conditions. Recent advances in the cancer epidemiology predicted the highest death rates within Europe and Korea due to lung cancer representing the leading cause of death within cancer patients. Therefore, we have sequenced the whole transcriptome following the highly sensitive path of RNA-seq with the combination of bioinformatics tools and experimental confirmation. The mRNA was subjected on Illumina HiSeq2000 for paired-end (PE) sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were conducted on Linux based software tools. The PE reads were aligned with Ensemble reference human genome version hg19 using TopHat2 and bowtie1. The fusion events were predicted using two different software packages, deFuse and Tophat-Fusion, and expression analysis was conducted using Cufflinks and R-package cumeRbund. The predicted fusion break-points were confirmed by target specific sanger-sequencing. Through the RNA-seq analysis, we identified a number of fusion events shared by oncogenes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell-lines including EML4:ALK fusion identified in recently established gefitinib resistant SNU2292 cell-line and some novel ones. Moreover, a significant increase in the expression of cell-line specific fusion genes was also observed. Our result will be helpful not only for discovering novel biomarkers but also for understanding the tumorigenesis of NSCLC.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.","title":"Fusion events in NSCLC cell lines identified by whole transcriptome analysis","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1539"}
