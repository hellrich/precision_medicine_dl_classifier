A 47-year-old woman had underwent resection of the olfactory groove meningioma. Then radiosurgery was done three times over 4 year period for the recurrent tumor. After 58 months from the initial radiosurgery, she presented with headache and progressive mental dullness. Huge tumor in bifrontal location was revealed in MRI. Subsequent operation and pathological examination confirmed diagnosis of glioblastoma. This case fits the criteria of radiation-induced tumor and the clinical implication of the issue is discussed.","title":"Glioblastoma following radiosurgery for meningioma.","pubmedId":"22500202"}
