The extension of fibrosis in relation to the mesorectal fascia (MRF) and the distribution of cancer cells within the fibrosis was examined using routine haematoxylin-eosin staining. In addition, immunohistochemical staining with CK20 was done to examine if cancer cells were missed by routine pathological work up.\nAll specimens showed CRT induced fibrosis. Two specimens showed complete response without viable cancer cells (ypT0). The fibrosis was limited inside the MRF in three cases, adherent to or involved the MRF in ten cases and in 33 cases the fibrosis was obvious outside as well as inside the fascia. Twenty-one cases showed fibrosis on the surgical resection margin, and in 9 of these cancer cells were found on the surgical margin (R1, R2-resection). 37 patients had R0 resections and among those 24 showed fibrosis beyond the MFR and 13 had scattered cancer cells in the fibrosis along or outside the MRF.\nThe rate of remaining cancer cells within the fibrosis was high in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with CRT. Frequently cancer cells were detected near the border of the fibrosis. A complete resection of the fibrosis is therefore recommended to achieve an R0 resection after neo-adjuvant treatment.","title":"Remaining cancer cells within the fibrosis after neo-adjuvant treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer.","pubmedId":"26108735"}
