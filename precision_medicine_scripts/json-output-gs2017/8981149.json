A total of 28 women with DES-exposed uteri were compared with 60 non-exposed women. Transvaginal ultrasound and colour Doppler imaging were performed on days 5 and 22 of the menstrual cycle. Uteri were measured on sagittal and transverse scans. Uterine length, width, thickness and uterine cavity length and width were measured. Uterine volume and uterine cavity area were calculated. DES-exposed uterine volume was equal to 31.84 +/- 3.37 cm3. The cavity area of DES-exposed uterus was equal to 35.85 +/- 3.93 cm2. Cervix length of DES-exposed uterus was significantly smaller than that of non-exposed uterus. The uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) of DES-exposed uterus was significantly higher than that of normal uterus. Blood flow remained stable throughout the menstrual cycle. The PI of DES-exposed uterus remained stable during the menstrual cycle, as in non-exposed uterus, and it decreased during the luteal phase. This lack of modification in vascularity of DES-exposed uterus may explain miscarriages and obstetric complications such as intrauterine growth retardation or pre-eclampsia. The data may have implications for the assessment of reproductive status and the design of future studies on disorders of implantation in DES-exposed uterus.","title":"Transvaginal ultrasound studies of vascular and morphological changes in uteri exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero.","pubmedId":"8981149"}
