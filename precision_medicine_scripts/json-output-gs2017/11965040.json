Warm ischemia of the pancreas of any duration during organ procurement may be detrimental to subsequent islet yield and functional viability of the islets. The aim of this study was to correlate pancreas procurement technique with the core temperature within the pancreas during in situ procurement to the recovery and in vitro function of isolated human islets.\nAlternative pancreata were recovered from human cadaveric organ donors with needle-point myocardial temperature probes placed within the body of the pancreas. After vascular flushing with University of Wisconsin organ preservation solution, the first group of human pancreata were removed after standard liver and kidney procurement followed by in situ dissection of the pancreas. The second group of pancreata were removed using a similar protocol, except that the lesser sac was opened (and the spleen was mobilized to the midline) rapidly at the time of aortic cross-clamp. An additional 3-4 L of ice slush solution was placed behind and in front of the pancreas and replenished throughout the procurement process for the liver and kidneys. Immediately after recovery, in both groups, the pancreas was placed in cold University of Wisconsin solution and transported to the islet isolation laboratory for processing. Islets were isolated using a standard protocol of Liberase perfusion via the duct, gentle mechanical dissociation, and Ficoll purification.\nThe absence of in situ ice-chilling of the entire pancreas during liver and kidney procurement caused the core pancreas temperature to rise to a peak of 18.2 degrees C; but when the pancreas was surrounded and replenished with iced saline slush, the core pancreas temperature was maintained at approximately 4 degrees C. The lower pancreas temperature correlated with a significantly higher recovery of islets in the group of pancreata surrounded with iced saline (223+/-35x10(3) IE vs. 103+/-26x10(3) IE; mean +/- SEM). Functional ability of the islets was also significantly improved in glucose static incubation, with a stimulation index of 4.4+/-0.3 in the iced-saline pancreas group versus 3.0+/-0.4 in the standard procurement group (P\u003c0.05, paired t test).\nProcurement technique and the maintenance of a low temperature of the pancreas are critical to subsequent islet recovery and function. Maintaining a low pancreas temperature during procurement through the addition and replenishment of iced saline slush surrounding the anterior and posterior aspects of the pancreas greatly improves islet yield and functional viability of the isolated islets and is essential for success in clinical islet transplantation.","title":"Effect of core pancreas temperature during cadaveric procurement on human islet isolation and functional viability.","pubmedId":"11965040"}
