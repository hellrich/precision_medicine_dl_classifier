Little has been published on the expression of cell cycle proteins after brain ischaemia in man. Well-characterized antisera were therefore used to examine the neuronal expression of CDK2, CDK4 and cyclins A, D1 and E in sections of brain from patients who had experienced cardiac arrest or focal brain infarction, and died 3.5 h to 9 days later. Scattered neurons contained elevated levels of cyclin D1, CDK2 and, to a lesser extent, CDK4, but little or no cyclin A or E. Present findings indicate that brain ischaemia induces the entry of some neurons from G0 into the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and suggest a potential therapeutic role for CDK inhibitors in ischaemic stroke.","title":"Neuronal expression of cell cycle-related proteins after brain ischaemia in man.","pubmedId":"14642430"}
