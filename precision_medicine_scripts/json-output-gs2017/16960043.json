Radiation therapy applied after surgery resulted in complete remission of the neurological deficits. The tumor recurred 18 months after surgical excision. A second surgery and another course of radiotherapy again resulted in complete remission of the clinical signs. The dog was euthanized 11 months after the second surgery because of tumor recurrence.","title":"Combined use of surgery and radiation in the treatment of an intradural myxoid liposarcoma in a dog.","pubmedId":"16960043"}
