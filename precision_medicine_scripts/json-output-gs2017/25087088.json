No demographic characteristics were associated with specific MET abnormalities, but patients who tested positive for mutation or amplification had more metastatic sites (median, 4 vs. 3 for wild type MET). Median overall survival after phase I consultation was 6.1 and 11.5 months for patients with and without a MET alteration, respectively (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.9; P \u003d .034). Twenty-nine (25%) patients were treated according to a c-MET inhibitor protocol. Six (21%) had a partial response (prostate and RCC) and 10 (34%) had stable disease as best response. Median time to tumor progression was 2.3 months (range, 0.4-19.7) for all treated patients with no responses in patients with a MET abnormality or single-agent c-MET inhibitor treatment.\nMET genetic abnormalities occur in diverse GU malignancies and are associated with a worse prognosis in a phase I setting. Efficacy of c-MET inhibitors was more pronounced in patients without MET abnormalities and when combined with other targets/drugs.","title":"MET abnormalities in patients with genitourinary malignancies and outcomes with c-MET inhibitors.","pubmedId":"25087088"}
