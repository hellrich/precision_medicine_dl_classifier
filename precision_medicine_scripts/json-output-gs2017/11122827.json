Combinations of novel chemotherapy agents such as taxanes and gemcitabine with hyperfractionated or accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy may further improve survival, although toxicity must be closely followed. Attempts to minimize the amount of normal tissue radiated through either three-dimensional treatment planning or use of a radioprotector (such as amifostine) may allow therapeutic escalation with chemoradiation and further success at treating the number one cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States.","title":"Hyperfractionated radiotherapy for lung cancer.","pubmedId":"11122827"}
