Fifteen of 18 tumors were KIT-positive. The three KIT-negative tumors were platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha positive. All patients with colonic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (n \u003d 4) underwent segmental resection, whereas patients with rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumors had local excision (n \u003d 5) or radical resection (n \u003d 9). Sixty-six percent (8/12) of patients with high-risk colorectal gastrointestinal stromal tumors developed metastases. None of the patients (n \u003d 6) with intermediate-risk, low-risk, or very low-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumors died of their disease after a median follow-up of 65 (range, 15-266) months.\nThe majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the colon and rectum are high-risk. Patients with high-risk colorectal gastrointestinal stromal tumors have a significant likelihood of developing metastases that is associated with poor prognosis. These patients need to be closely followed for an extended period and should be considered for adjuvant therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","title":"Clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical characteristics of gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the colon and rectum: implications for surgical management and adjuvant therapies.","pubmedId":"16552495"}
