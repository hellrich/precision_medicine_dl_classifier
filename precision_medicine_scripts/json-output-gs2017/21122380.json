The relationship between the mutations and clinicopathological characteristics of the 301 patients was analyzed.\nEGFR mutations were present in 32.9% (99/301) of the samples: 3 mutation in exon 18, 59 in exon 19, 2 in exon 20, and 35 in exon 21. Mutations of K-ras were present in 4.7% (14/301) of the samples: 13 in codon 12 and 1 in codon 13. EGFR mutations were never found in tumors with K-ras mutations, suggesting a mutually exclusive relationship. EGFR mutations were more common in adenocarcinomas, non-smokers and females. Seven out of 10 erlotinib-treated patients with disease control carried EGFR mutation.\nThe frequency of EGFR mutation in Chinese NSCLC patients is higher than that in Westerners, but the frequency of K-ras mutation is quite opposite. Combined detection of EGFR gene and K-ras gene mutation may help clinicians to choose patients who may gain benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment, and to predict their response to erlotinib treatment and prognosis.","title":"[Relationship between EGFR and K-ras mutations and clinicopathological characteristics and response to erlotinib treatment in 301 Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"21122380"}
