Using 534 curatively resected ESCCs, the PIK3CA gene copy number was evaluated with fluorescent in situ hybridization. PIK3CA amplification was defined as PIK3CA/centromere 3 ratio is ≥ 2.0 or average number of PIK3CA signals/tumor cell nucleus ≥ 5.0. PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 and 20, encoding the highly conserved helical and kinase domains were assessed by direct sequencing in 388 cases. PIK3CA amplification was detected in 56 (10.5%) cases. PIK3CA amplification was significantly associated with higher T-stage (P\u003d0.026) and pathologic stage (P\u003d0.053). PIK3CA amplification showed a significantly shorter disease free survival (DFS) compared with that of non-amplified group (33.4 vs 63.1 months, P\u003d0.019). After adjusting for gender, tumor location, pathologic stage, histologic grade and adjuvant treatment, PIK3CA amplification was significantly associated with a shorter DFS (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.53; 95% CI, 1.10-2.17; P\u003d0.02). Though the statistical insignificance, PIK3CA amplification showed tendency of shorter OS (52.1 vs 96.5 moths, P\u003d0.116). PIK3CA mutations were detected in 6 (1.5%) of 388 cases; 5 cases with exon 9 mutations in E545K while one exon 20 mutation in H1047L. PIK3CA amplification is a frequent oncogenic alteration and associated with shorter survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker in resected ESCC. PIK3CA amplification may represent a promising therapeutic target for ESCC.
