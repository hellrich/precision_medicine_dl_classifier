Tumor growth inhibition, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and (18)FDG-positron emission tomography were conducted to assess the antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and antimetabolic responses, respectively. Effects on proliferation were also analyzed by immunohistochemical methods. Additionally, three patient-derived xenografts from primary and metastatic sites were treated with ENMD-2076 (100 mg/kg) and assessed for tumor growth inhibition.\nIn the HT-29 xenograft model, ENMD-2076 induced initial tumor growth inhibition followed by regression. Treatment was associated with significant tumor blanching, indicating a loss of vascularity and substantial reductions in tumor vascular permeability and perfusion as measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography scanning showed significant decreases in (18)FDG uptake at days 3 and 21 of treatment, which was associated with a marked reduction in proliferation as assessed by Ki-67. All three of the patient-derived xenografts tested were sensitive to treatment with ENMD 2076 as measured by tumor growth inhibition.\nENMD-2076 showed robust antitumor activity against cell line and patient-derived xenograft models of CRC that is detectable by functional imaging, supporting clinical investigation of this agent in CRC.","title":"Assessment of the in vivo antitumor effects of ENMD-2076, a novel multitargeted kinase inhibitor, against primary and cell line-derived human colorectal cancer xenograft models.","pubmedId":"20406842"}
