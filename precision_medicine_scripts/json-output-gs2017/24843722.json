We aimed to provide the quantitative estimates for the association between diabetes or antidiabetic treatment and lung cancer risk in the present meta-analysis.\nCohort studies were identified by searching the PubMed database (January 1960 through October 2012) and manually assessing the cited references in the retrieved articles. Study-specific relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.\nA total of 19 cohort studies were included in the present meta-analysis. Of these, 14 studies focused on the association between diabetes and lung cancer incidence, and seven studies focused on the association between antidiabetic treatment and lung cancer incidence. Compared with non-diabetic individuals, diabetic patients do not have an increased risk of lung cancer (RR \u003d 1.04, 95% CI 0.87-1.24). The association between diabetes and lung cancer remained not statistically significant in subgroup analysis stratified by study characteristics, study quality, diabetes ascertainment or important confounders. A null association between insulin or biguanides therapy and lung cancer risk was found. However, the diabetic patients receiving thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment had a 20% reduced risk of lung cancer than those without TZD treatment.\nNo association between diabetes and lung cancer risk was found. However, TZD treatment might reduce lung cancer risk in diabetic patients.","title":"Association between diabetes or antidiabetic therapy and lung cancer: A meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"24843722"}
