The aim of our study was to evaluate the mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in chronic inflammatory or malignant pancreatic pathology in order to elucidate the differences in expression patterns and potential clinical implications.\nThirty-five patients who had undergone endoscopic ultrasonography followed by endoscipic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of focal pancreatic masses were included in the study. VEGF and EGFR mRNA expression levels in the samples collected by EUS-FNA were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nVEGF expression was detected in all chronic pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma samples and in only 62.5% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. EGFR expression was detected in only 40% of the chronic pancreatitis cases, 76.9% of adenocarcinomas and in 50% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Both VEGF and EGFR mRNA levels were significantly higher in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma than those in normal tissue. VEGF expression inversely correlated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma size, while EGFR expression was related to local invasiveness of adenocarcinoma.\nBoth VEGF and EGFR mRNA expression in EUS-FNA samples may be used as a diagnostic marker associated with invasiveness in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumours and chronic pancreatitis.","pubmedId":"24949370"}
