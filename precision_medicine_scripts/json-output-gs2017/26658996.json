This tumor type is driven by gain-of-function mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (such as KIT, PDGFRA, and BRAF) or loss-of-function mutations in succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit genes (SDHx). Molecular studies on GIST have improved our understanding of the biology of the disease and have led to the use of targeted therapy approach, such as imatinib for KIT/PDGFRA-mutated GIST. Recently, microRNAs have emerged as important regulators of KIT expression, cancer cell behavior, and imatinib response in GIST. This chapter aims to provide an overview on current understanding of the biological roles of microRNAs in GIST and possible implications in prognosis and therapeutic response.
