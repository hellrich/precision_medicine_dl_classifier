APC8015 (Provenge) is one such investigational therapeutic vaccine that uses autologous antigen presenting cells (APCs) loaded with a recombinant fusion protein of prostatic acid phosphatase linked to a molecule that specifically targets a receptor expressed on the surface of human APCs. Clinical trial outcomes have demonstrated activity in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer.","title":"Immunotherapy with autologous antigen presenting cells for the treatment of androgen independent prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"15647927"}
