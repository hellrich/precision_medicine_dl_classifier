Recent studies have suggested that NSF alters the conformation of the SNAP receptors (SNAREs) to permit their interaction, or to uncouple them after they interact. Most organisms have a single NSF gene product but Drosophila express two highly related isoforms, dNSF-1 and dNSF-2. dNSF-1 is encoded by the gene comatose (comt), first identified as the locus of a temperature-sensitive paralytic mutation. Here we show that dNSF-1 is most abundant in the nervous system and can be detected in larval and adult CNS. Subcellular fractionation revealed that dNSF-1 was enriched in a vesicle fraction along with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin. comt flies maintained at the non-permissive temperature rapidly accumulate sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-resistant SNARE complexes at the restrictive temperature, with concomitant translocation of dNSF-1 from cytosol and membrane fractions into a Triton X-100 insoluble fraction. The long recovery of comt flies after heat shock induced paralysis correlated with the irreversibility of this translocation. Interestingly, while dNSF-1 also translocates in comt(TP7) larvae, there is no associated neurophysiological phenotype at the neuromuscular junction (nmj) or accumulation of SDS-resistant complexes in the CNS. Together, these results suggest that dNSF-1 is required for adult neuronal function, but that in the larval nmj function may be maintained by other isoforms.","title":"Analysis of the mutant Drosophila N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion-1 protein in comatose reveals molecular correlates of the behavioural paralysis.","pubmedId":"11389191"}
