Current treatments of this tumor have only modest benefit leading investigators to query whether comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) would have potential to discover novel targets of therapy.  Methods:  DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections from 37 consecutive cases of relapsed/metastatic NCAP. CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 583X for up to 315 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Genomic alterations (GA) included base substitutions (SUB), INDELs, copy number alterations (CNA) and fusions/rearrangements. Clinically relevant GA (CRGA) were defined as GA linked to drugs on the market or under evaluation in mechanism driven clinical trials.  Results:  The median age of the men in this study was 65.1 years (range 43 to 83 years). All (100%) cases were positive for neuroendocrine markers on immunohistochemical staining and were Stage IV at the time of CGP. Samples used for sequencing were obtained from the primary tumor in 9 (24%) of NCAP and from metastatic sites in 28 (76%) of NCAP (12 liver, 6 LN, 2 each from bladder, pelvis and soft tissue, and 1 each from rectum, bone, urethra and ureter. There were 213 total GA (5.8 GA/sample) and 47 CRGA (1.3 CRGA/sample). The most frequent GA were non-CRGA mutations in TP53 (68%) and RB1 (51%). TMPRSS:ERG fusions were identified in 32% of cases whereas AR was altered in 8% (1 mutation and 2 amplifications). The most frequent CRGA involved PTEN (32%), BRCA2 (14%), FGFR1 (5%), PIK3CA (5%) and AKT2 (3%). No alterations in BRAF were identified. Clinical responses to MTOR inhibitors in patients with MTOR pathway alterations will be presented.  Conclusions:  NCAP has distinctive genomic alterations from classic acinar CAP including reduced frequencies of alterations in TMPRSS:ERG and AR and frequent RB1 mutations. Multiple alterations in the MTOR pathway identified in this infrequent tumor type suggest that these patients may be candidates for MTOR inhibitors and other targeted therapies.","title":"Comprehensive genomic profiling of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate.","pubmedId":"ASCO_157502-172"}
