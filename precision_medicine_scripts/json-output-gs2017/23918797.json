Treatment with LJM716 reduced HER2-HER3 and HER3-p85 dimers, P-HER3 and P-AKT, both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with LJM716 alone markedly reduced growth of BT474 xenografts. The combination of LJM716/lapatinib/trastuzumab significantly improved survival of mice with BT474 xenografts compared with lapatinib/trastuzumab (P \u003d 0.0012). LJM716 and BYL719 synergistically inhibited growth in a panel of HER2+ and PIK3CA mutant cell lines. The combination also inhibited P-AKT in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells and growth of HER2+ NCI-N87 gastric cancer xenografts more potently than LJM716 or BYL719 alone. Trastuzumab-resistant HER2+/PIK3CA mutant MDA453 xenografts regressed completely after 3 weeks of therapy with LJM716 and BYL719, whereas either single agent inhibited growth only partially. Finally, mice with BT474 xenografts treated with trastuzumab/LJM716, trastuzumab/BYL719, LJM716/BYL719, or trastuzumab/LJM716/BYL719 exhibited similar rates of tumor regression after 3 weeks of treatment. Thirty weeks after treatment discontinuation, 14% of mice were treated with trastuzumab/LJM716/BYL719, whereas \u003e80% in all other treatment groups were sacrificed due to a recurrent large tumor burden (P \u003d 0.0066). These data suggest that dual blockade of the HER2 signaling network with an HER3 antibody that inhibits HER2-HER3 dimers in combination with a p110α-specific inhibitor in the absence of a direct HER2 antagonist is an effective treatment approach against HER2-overexpressing cancers.","title":"Combination of antibody that inhibits ligand-independent HER3 dimerization and a p110α inhibitor potently blocks PI3K signaling and growth of HER2+ breast cancers.","pubmedId":"23918797"}
