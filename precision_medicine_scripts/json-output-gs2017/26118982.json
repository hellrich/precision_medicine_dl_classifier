HER2 copy gain was observed in 21.8% of the patients, more frequently with lymph node metastases (P\u003d0.048) and stage IIIA disease (P\u003d0.061). KRAS gain was found in 29.3% of the tumors, and was not associated with patients\u0027 clinicopathological features. No BRAF mutations were found. EGFR and KRAS mutation frequency and associations with clinicopathological characteristics did not differ significantly from those previously described for the NSCLC patients of Caucasian ethnicity. Strong associations existed between most of the analyzed alterations. In the multivariate model, EGFR mutations constituted an independent prognostic factor of the disease recurrence in adenocarcinoma patients (HR 7.20; 95%CI 1.31-39.48; P\u003d0.023), while an increased EGFR copy number tended to indicate a shorter overall survival (HR 4.85; 95%CI 0.92-25.58; P\u003d0.062).\nEGFR pathway genes alterations are frequent in NSCLCs from Polish patients and have a prognostic potential for patients\u0027 clinical outcome after a curative tumor resection. Gene CN evaluation by quantitative PCR provides comparable results and enables assay standardization, yet the optimal scoring system needs to be developed.","title":"Significance of EGFR signaling pathway genetic alterations in radically resected non-small cell lung cancers from a Polish cohort.
