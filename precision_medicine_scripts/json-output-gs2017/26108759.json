Furthermore, complete mesocolic excision (CME) as a new concept in colon cancer surgery was first proposed by Hohenberger from Germany, which follows the oncological principle of the tumor and is based on the embryology and anatomy. Some researches about CME showed that this procedure could improve the prognosis, decrease the local recurrence of the tumor without increased complications. Although a laparoscopic approach for right colon cancer is performed frequently, identifying an adequate dissection plane is not always easy. The surgeons need to know well about local anatomy of laparoscopic-assisted radical right hemicolectomy, and to master the right surgical plane in operation process, then to reduce the incidence of conversion to laparotomy and side injury. The superior mesenteric vein (SMV) is the key landmark. The fusion fascia space is the right surgical plane, as well as a series of peripheral peritoneal attachments are important fixations in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy by medial access. Identifying the anatomical location of the SMV and performing meticulous dissection along the SMV is an essential procedure to dissect all potential lymphatic drainage during laparoscopic CME for right colon cancer.
