Additional genes involved in DNA repair have been identified as predisposing to breast cancer. Recently, RAD51C, a new Fanconi Anemia gene, essential for homologous recombination repair, has been reported to be a rare hereditary breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene. Indeed, several pathogenic mutations have been identified in BRCA1/BRCA2-negative hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families. Here, we present the results of the screening of RAD51C mutations in a large series of 516 BRCA1/BRCA2-negative Spanish patients from breast and/or ovarian cancer families, and the evaluation of these results in the context of all RAD51C carriers. RAD51C mutation screening was performed by DNA analysis for all index cases. All the genetic variants identified were analyzed in silico for splicing and protein predictions. cDNA analysis was performed for three selected variants. All previous RAD51C mutation studies on breast and/or ovarian cancer were reviewed. We identified three inactivating RAD51C mutations. Two mutations were found in breast and ovarian cancer families and one mutation in a site-specific breast cancer family. Based on the mean age of ovarian cancer diagnosis in RAD51C carriers, we would recommend prophylactic bilateral salpingo-ophorectomy in premenopausal RAD51C mutation carriers. Our results support that RAD51C is a rare breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene and may contribute to a small fraction of families including breast and ovarian cancer cases and families with only breast cancer. Thus, RAD51C testing should be offered to hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer families without selecting for specific cancer origin.
