Recently, development of small molecules that inhibit the kinase activity of mutant C-KIT and PDGFR proteins has radically changed treatment and prognosis of patients diagnosed with advanced GIST as this molecularly \"targeted\" therapy has demonstrated remarkable high-level of activity in this disease.","title":"Advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors: systemic treatment options.","pubmedId":"22069173"}
