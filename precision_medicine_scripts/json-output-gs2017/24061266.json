This article illustrates the image and histological features that correlate with CT texture parameters obtained from tumours using the filtration-histogram approach, which comprises image filtration to highlight image features of a specified size followed by histogram analysis for quantification. Computer modelling can be used to generate texture parameters for a range of simple hypothetical images with specified image features. The model results are useful in explaining relationships between image features and texture parameters. The main image features that can be related to texture parameters are the number of objects highlighted by the filter, the brightness and/or contrast of highlighted objects relative to background attenuation, and the variability of brightness/contrast of highlighted objects. These relationships are also demonstrable by texture analysis of clinical CT images. The results of computer modelling may facilitate the interpretation of the reported associations between CT texture and histopathology in human tumours. The histogram parameters derived during the filtration-histogram method of CT texture analysis have specific relationships with a range of image features. Knowledge of these relationships can assist the understanding of results obtained from clinical CT texture analysis studies in oncology.
