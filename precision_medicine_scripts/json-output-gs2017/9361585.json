Recently there have been significant advances in understanding of the genetics, with the sequencing of the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 which are associated with hereditary breast cancer.\nCurrent understanding of hereditary breast cancer and its impact on the management of women with this disease is reviewed.\nProblems in accurate testing for breast cancer-associated genes remain. No reliable simple test exists because of the large number of mutations present in these genes. The implications of different mutations remain poorly understood. Guidelines for the management of carriers of the breast cancer-associated genes remain controversial.","title":"Hereditary breast cancer.","pubmedId":"9361585"}
