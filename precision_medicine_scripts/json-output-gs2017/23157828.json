Five types of mutation were detected at codon 12, including G12D (40 cases, 16.4%), G12V (16 cases, 6.6%), G12A (7 cases, 2.9%), G12S (5 cases, 2.0%) and G12C (4 cases, 1.6%). Two types of mutation were detected at codon 13, including G13D (17 cases, 7.0%) and G13C (2 cases, 0.8%). One type of mutation was detected in codon 61, i.e. Q61K (1 case, 0.4%). KRAS mutation rate was higher in females (45.6%, 36/79) than in males (32.1%, 53/165; P \u003c 0.05), but not related to another clinicopathological characteristics.\nFemale CRC patients have a higher KRAS mutation rate than the male patients. KRAS mutation has no significant correlation with patient\u0027s age, tumor site, tumor gross appearance, degree of differentiation, depth of invasion, TNM stages, lymphatic invasion, abdominal or distant metastases and prognosis in this study.","title":"[Correlation of KRAS gene mutations and clinicopathologic parameters in colorectal carcinoma].","pubmedId":"23157828"}
