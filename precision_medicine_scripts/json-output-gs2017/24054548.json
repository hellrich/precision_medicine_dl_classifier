PJS is a rare hereditary disease, which may be associated with the development of poor outcome adenocarcinomas and LKB1-gene mutations. A very rare type of a LKB1 mutation was found, not previously described in lung cancer. Although seldom screened for LKB-1 mutations are found in up to 30% of lung adenocarcinomas and may be druggable therapeutic targets, in particular in KRAS mutant tumours in the near future as recent preclinical results with nucleotides demonstrate.
