The aim of this study is to determine whether germline isocitrate dehydrogenase genes mutations are involved.We targeted IDH1 and IDH2 genes in 104 familial cases belonging to Tunisian and French populations, including several forms of hematological malignancies and cosegregated solid tumors.We report one IDH1 variant: c.315 G\u003eT, p.Gly105Gly in 15Â % of cases, which was assigned to the worst outcome in several studies. Three IDH2 variants were found, among them, one intronic substitution c.543+45 G\u003eA (rs142033117) and two new variants not previously described: c.389 A\u003eT, p.Lys130Met and c.414 T\u003eC, p.Thr138Thr. The p.Lys130Met was found in one case diagnosed with Waldenstrom\u0027s disease with familial history of cancer. The enrolled in silico analysis, the functional study, and the absence of this variant in control population strengthen the hypothesis of its deleterious effect.From an extended number of candidate genes analyzed in familial hematological malignancies, IDH2 might be considerably involved since we reported a potential damaging effect.","title":"Familial hematological malignancies: new IDH2 mutation.","pubmedId":"27591990"}
