The mortality rate of hormonal responsible breast cancer has been drastically decreased by different sequential hormonal manipulations. It is mostly due to tamoxifen, which is an ER blocator. As the synthesis of estrogens in postmenopausal women occurs through the aromatization of androgens, the third generation of new nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AI), have been showed as strong drugs for endocrine therapy. Since they showed the advantage over tamoxifen in advanced breast cancer of postmenopausal women, there are currently the investigations of their value in early breast cancer adjuvant therapy, as well as the side-effects of the therapy. So far, tamoxifen remains a gold standard of adjuvant hormonal therapy for endocrine-dependent breast cancer.","title":"[Aromatase inhibitors--new horizons in breast cancer endocrine therapy].","pubmedId":"15822681"}
