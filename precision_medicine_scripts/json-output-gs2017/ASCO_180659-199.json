This study compared efficacy and toxicities of osimertinib versus docetaxel -bevacizumab as third-line treatment in EGFR T790M mutated NSCLC. Methods: In this phase 3, open-label, three-center study, we randomly assigned previously treated with TKI-chemotherapy or chemotherapy-TKI recurrent or metastatic advanced non-squamous lung cancer patients who had acquired EGFR T790M resistance mutation confirmed by tumor tissues or serum genetic test. Patients were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to receive oral osimertinib (80mg/day) or receive intravenous infusion docetaxel (75mg/m2) and bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg) until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Docetaxel -bevacizumab group patients might crossover to osimertinib group after disease progression. The primary end-point of this study was progression-free survival and the secondary end-point were response rates, toxicities and OS. Results: A total of 147 patients were treated. Among them, 74 enrolled in the osimertinib group and 73 in the docetaxel-bevacizumab group. The median progression-free survival was 10.20 months and 2.95 months in the osimertinib group and docetaxel -bevacizumab group respectively (Hazard ratio 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.38; P \u003c 0.0001). The overall response rate and disease control rate was 61.6% or 87.6% in osimertinib group 8.3% or 43.0% in docetaxel-bevacizumab group respectively. The median overall survival time was not reached. The main grade 3 or 4 toxic effects were diarrhea (2.7%) and interstitial lung disease (1.2%) in the osimertinib group and alopecia (15.1%), anorexia (12.3%), neutropenia (9.6%) and nausea (8.6%) in docetaxel -bevacizumab group. Conclusions: Response rate and progression-free survival of osimertinib group were superior to docetaxel-bevacizumab group in third-line treatment of EGFR T790M positive NSCLC. There was no survival difference between patients with EGFR 19 Del-T790M mutation and EGFR L858R-T790M mutation.
