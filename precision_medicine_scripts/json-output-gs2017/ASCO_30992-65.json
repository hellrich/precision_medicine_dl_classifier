Methods: Exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations in tumor and paired serum DNA were assessed in one central laboratory, using three different techniques. Results: From April 2005 to December 2008, 2507 p were screened. EGFR mutations were detected in 358 p; 217 were entered on the trial: 158 (72.8%) female; 148 (68.2%) never-smokers; 176 (81.1%) adenocarcinoma; 134 (62.3%) exon 19 deletion, 83 (37.7%) L858R mutation; 112 (51.6%) first-line, 104 (48.4%) second-line. Response in 139/197 evaluable p (70.6%); complete response (CR) in 24 p (12.2%). Odds ratio for response: 3 for p with exon 19 deletion (P\u003d0.001). Time to progression (TTP): 14 months (m). Median survival (MS): 27 m. MS according to response shown in table. Cox model for TTP showed that male gender (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3; P\u003d0.001), L858R mutation (HR, 1.8; P\u003d0.008), and mutated EGFR in serum (HR,1.6; P\u003d0.03) had a negative impact. Conclusions: A multicenter study of customized erlotinib, using a central screening laboratory, is feasible and shows the outstanding benefit to p for selecting erlotinib treatment based on EGFR mutation status. The SLCG has initiated a randomized trial of first-line erlotinib vs chemotherapy.
