In addition, the FGFR4 functional polymorphism G388R has been associated with poor outcome in several human malignancies. Then, we hypothesized that FGFR4 expression and genotype could be markers of adverse outcome of Cushing\u0027s disease after transsphenoidal surgery.\nThe objective was to investigate whether there is an association between the postoperative outcome of Cushing\u0027s disease (remission/recurrence) and the FGFR4 G388R genotype or the FGFR4 expression in corticotrophinomas.\nClinical, hormonal, and pathological data of 76 patients who underwent the first transsphenoidal surgery were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were genotyped for G388R polymorphism. FGFR4 expression was assessed by real-time PCR in 18 corticotrophinomas.\nThe outcome measures included the FGFR4 G388R genotype and FGFR4 expression in postoperative remission and recurrence of Cushing\u0027s disease.\nHomozygosis for FGFR4 glycine (Gly(388)) allele was associated with reduced disease-free survival, in the univariate analysis (hazard ratio of 6.91; 95% confidence interval of 1.14-11.26; P \u003d 0.028). Male gender (P \u003d 0.036), lack of pathology confirmation (P \u003d 0.009), and cortisol levels more than 2 Î¼g/dl in the early postoperative period (P \u003c 0.001) were also significant predictors of Cushing\u0027s disease recurrence in the univariate analysis. FGFR4 overexpression was found in 44% of the corticotrophinomas, and it was associated with lower postoperative remission rate (P \u003d 0.009).\nOur data suggest that homozygosis for FGFR4 Gly(388) allele and FGFR4 overexpression are associated with higher frequency of postoperative recurrence and persistence of Cushing\u0027s disease, respectively.","title":"Influence of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 expression and the G388R functional polymorphism on Cushing\u0027s disease outcome.","pubmedId":"20660043"}
