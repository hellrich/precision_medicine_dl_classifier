We describe a 90-year-old male patient, who came with synchronous male breast cancer and carcinoma of the prostate. The first presentation was spinal cord compression with multiple lytic lesions in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae on computed tomography. Serum tumor marker tests revealed an elevated serum PSA level of 104 ng/dL (normal \u003c4 ng/dL) and a low free PSA of 11.6%. A histological examination of a specimen from a lytic lesion of the spine was consistent with metastatic breast cancer and a needle biopsy of the prostate showed adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3 + 4.","title":"Synchronous male breast cancer and carcinoma of prostate in 90-year-old male, presented with spinal cord compression and multiple spine lytic lesions.","pubmedId":"17593047"}
