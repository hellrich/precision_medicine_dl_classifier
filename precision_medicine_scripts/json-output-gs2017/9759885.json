Ligation of SCFR induces its dimerization and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity leading to activation of Raf-1, phospholipases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases. However, little is known about the downstream signals initiated by SCFR ligation except for activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases. The murine mast cell line, MC/9, synthesizes and secretes TNF-alpha following the aggregation of high affinity Fc receptors for IgE (Fc epsilonRI). Ligation of SCFR or Fc epsilonRI on MC/9 cells resulted in the activation of all three MAP kinase family members, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. Stem cell factor (SCF)-induced activation of JNK and p38 was insensitive to wortmannin, cyclosporin A, and FK506 whereas activation of these kinases through Fc epsilonRI was sensitive to these drugs. Coligation of SCFR augmented Fc epsilonRI-mediated activation of MAP kinases, especially JNK activation, and SCF augmented Fc epsilonRI-mediated TNF-alpha production in MC/9 cells, although SCF alone did not induce TNF-alpha production. This augmentation by SCF was regulated at the level of transcription, at least in part, since the promoter activity of TNF-alpha was enhanced following addition of SCF. These results demonstrate that SCF can augment Fc epsilonRI-mediated JNK activation and cytokine gene transcription but via pathways that are regulated differently than the ones activated through Fc epsilonRI.","title":"Stem cell factor augments Fc epsilon RI-mediated TNF-alpha production and stimulates MAP kinases via a different pathway in MC/9 mast cells.","pubmedId":"9759885"}
