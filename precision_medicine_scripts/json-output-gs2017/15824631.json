Increased risks also were observed in men who were employed as truck drivers; railroad brake, signal, and switch operators; purchasing agents and buyers; teachers; insurance agents; and retail supervisors. Among women, a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer was found for employment in furniture and home furnishing stores, and a borderline significantly increased risk among textile sewing machine operators and tenders.\nWorking in several occupations and industries was associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in this study, and these associations warrant further investigation.","title":"Occupation and risk of pancreatic cancer: a population-based case-control study in iowa.","pubmedId":"15824631"}
