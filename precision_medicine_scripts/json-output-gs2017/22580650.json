The prognostic factors for cancer-specific survival and overall survival after surgery were investigated.\nThe cancer-specific 5-, 10- and 20-year survival rates after resection of the ampullary carcinoma were 52%, 43% and 43%, respectively, while the corresponding overall survival rates were 52%, 32% and 24%, respectively. Ten of the 11 patients with recurrent ampullary carcinoma died within 5 years after surgery. Four patients died because of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, old age after curative resection of gastric cancer, and pneumonia at later than 5 years after the surgery. The risk factors for the short cancer-specific survival period were pancreatic invasion and lymph node metastasis, while those for the short overall survival period were pancreatic invasion and the tumor grade.\nOur study indicates that recurrence of ampullary carcinoma within 5 years after its resection, especially in patients with pancreatic invasion or lymph node metastasis and development of other diseases after more than 5 years after the surgery should be carefully investigated.","title":"Long-term outcome of surgical treatment for ampullary carcinoma.","pubmedId":"22580650"}
