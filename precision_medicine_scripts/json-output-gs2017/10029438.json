We hypothesize that ductal hyperplasia and dysplasia of the pancreas represent precursor lesions and are part of a continuous developmental spectrum evolving into ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. To further define this sequence, we studied the immunohistochemical markers HER-2/neu, K-ras, and p53 in 15 adenocarcinomas and 15 nonmalignant specimens of the pancreas. The 15 nonmalignant specimens of the pancreas included both normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis. Overall, HER-2/neu was positive in normal ducts, ductal hyperplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma cells in 0 of 30, 11 of 20 (55%), 10 of 15 (67%), and 12 of 15 (80%), respectively, with progressive increase in the intensity of staining; p53 was positive in 1 of 30 (3%), 0 of 20, 3 of 15 (20%), and 13 of 15 (80%), respectively, and K-ras was positive in 1 of 30 (3%), 6 of 20 (30%), 11 of 15 (73%), and 8 of 15% (53%), respectively. These data support the hypothesis that ductal hyperplasia and dysplasia of the pancreas represent precursor lesions, and, in a fashion similar to that in colorectal tumorigenesis, pancreatic cancer seems to accumulate progressive genetic alterations.","title":"Immunohistochemical evaluation of K-ras, p53, and HER-2/neu expression in hyperplastic, dysplastic, and carcinomatous lesions of the pancreas: evidence for multistep carcinogenesis.","pubmedId":"10029438"}
