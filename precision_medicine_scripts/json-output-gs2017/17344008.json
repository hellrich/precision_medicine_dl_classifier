We did not find any statistically significant differences in age and tumor localization between these two groups of patients.\nAll the patients died. In the group of patients treated with brachytherapy and with stent implantation, the mean survival time was 387.9 days. In the group of patients treated only with stent insertion the mean survival was 298 days. In effort to eliminate possible effect of external radiotherapy we treated the control group of eight patients with cholangiocarcinoma by stent insertion and brachytherapy only.\nOur results show that combined radiation therapy could extend the survival in the patients with cholangiocarcinoma obstruction.","title":"Brachytherapy and percutaneous stenting in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma: a prospective randomised study.","pubmedId":"17344008"}
