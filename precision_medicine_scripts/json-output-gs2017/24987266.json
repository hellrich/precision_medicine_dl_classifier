{"keywords":["Atrial septal defect","Kawasaki disease","giant coronary aneurysm"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"All giant Kawasaki aneurysms may not regress fully; some may eventually calcify, undergo thrombosis, and get detected in asymptomatic adults at later age. Tomisaku Kawasaki initially described this illness as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome in childhood in 1967 and coronary arteritis was recognized later. We present a 58-year-old male, possibly one of the oldest surviving patients with giant coronary aneurysms who presented with large secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) with heart failure. This indicates that the disease was perhaps prevalent outside Japan even before the first Kawasaki\u0027s description.
