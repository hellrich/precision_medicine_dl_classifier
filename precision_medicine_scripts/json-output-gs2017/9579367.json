Of the 154 patients diagnosed with signet ring cell carcinoma, 94 had early and 60 had advanced gastric carcinoma. The percentage of patients with an early carcinoma was significantly higher among those with signet ring cell carcinoma compared with those with other gastric carcinoma histologies.\nThe survival of the total group of patients with signet ring cell carcinoma was significantly better than that of patients with other types of gastric carcinoma (P \u003c 0.05). Survival of the subset of patients with early signet ring cell carcinoma was also improved compared with patients with other types of gastric carcinoma (P \u003c 0.05). However, patients with advanced signet ring cell carcinoma had a poor prognosis similar to that of patients with other types of gastric carcinoma.","title":"Characterization of signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach.","pubmedId":"9579367"}
