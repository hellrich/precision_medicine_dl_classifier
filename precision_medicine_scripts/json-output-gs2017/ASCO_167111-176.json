Methods: Pts with advanced solid tumors and ECOG performance status  2 were eligible. Tumor DNA was isolated from a FFPE archived sample when available or from a fresh tumor biopsy. DNA analysis was performed by next generation sequencing using a panel of 287 genes and by comparative genomic hybridization. Results for each pts were discussed during a weekly multidisciplinary molecular tumor board (MTB). Results: From January 2014 to June 2015, 568 pts were enrolled. Median number of prior lines was 2 (range 0-9). Most common primaries were: lung (16.9%), colorectal (14.4%), breast (10.6%), ovarian (10.2%), and sarcomas (10.2%). Median age was 63 years (range 19-88). In 28 cases (5%) molecular analysis failed because of insufficient tissue. Median time from first referral to reporting was 9 weeks (range 1-36). The 20 genes most frequently altered were TP53, CDKN2A, KRAS, PTEN, PI3KCA, RB1, APC, ERBB2, MYC, EGFR, CDKN2B, ARID1A, SMAD4, FGFR1, MDM2, BRAF, ATM, CCNE1, FGFR3, FRS2. 292 pts (51.4%) had at least one actionable genetic alteration. 159 pts (28%) were included in a clinical trial (CT). The treatment was matched with the tumor profile in 86 cases (15%). Main reasons for non-inclusion in a CT for pts with actionable mutation were: non progressive disease (31.5%), general status deterioration (25%), death (16.5%), CT not available (10.5%), screening failure (6.5%), lost of follow-up (7%), and patient refusal (3%). 135 pts were evaluable for response according to RECIST 1.1. The disease control rate (objective response + stable disease) was 47.7% for pts included in matched CT versus 47.7% (p \u003d 0.4) for pts included in other CT. Median progression-free survival was 3 months (95 CI 1.7-4.3) versus 3.4 months (95 CI 1.7-5) (p \u003d 0.4). Conclusions: EMP is feasible in routine practice, allows identification of actionable mutations in most of cases and can be used to enroll pts in matched EPCT.
