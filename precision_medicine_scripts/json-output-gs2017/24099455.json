The presence of isolated metastases is treated with surgical excision with good anticipated results. On the other hand, systemic chemotherapy is administered in the context of metastatic spread, usually sunitib or sorafenib. In such cases, however, the presence of symptomatic foci calls for minimal intervention.We present a case of a 77-year-old patient who presented with obstructive jaundice due to an ampullary mass. Endoscopic excision and biopsy set the diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Consequently, imaging studies revealed the presence of multiple foci in the lungs and bone. Therefore, pancreatoduodenectomy was excluded and the patient underwent endoscopic ampullectomy and was set to oral sunitinib. Interestingly, despite generalized spread, local control was achieved until the patient succumbed to carcinomatosis.Painless obstructive jaundice in a patient with history of renal cancer and negative computed tomography scanning for pancreatic or other causes of obstruction should alert for prompt investigation for an ampullary metastasis.
