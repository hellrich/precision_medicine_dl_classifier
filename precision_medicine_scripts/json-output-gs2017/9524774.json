HGF/SF induces various morphogenic responses in epithelial cells that derive from different tissues when these are grown in three-dimensional gels, e.g. branching tubules in kidney, breast, and prostate epithelial cells, crypt-like structures with brush border in colon epithelial cells, and alveolar-like aggregates in lung and pancreas cells. Epithelial cells are thus able to form complex structures in vitro which resemble the structures formed in the organ they originate from. We also examined the response of human breast carcinoma cells to HGF/SF in vivo. MDA MB 435 cells transfected with HGF/SF were injected into the mammary fat pad of nude mice, where they form tumours which spontaneously metastasize to the lungs. We found that expression of HGF/SF promoted metastasis whereas expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin was inhibitory. Moreover, expression of E-cadherin reconstituted the ability of the cells to form complex structures in response to HGF/SF in vitro. These data demonstrate that the different responses to HGF/SF depend on the state of the epithelial cells: morphogenesis requires epithelial differentiation and cell polarity, whereas metastasis is observed when the cells have lost their epithelial characteristics. Moreover, we have recently identified Gab-1 as a direct-binding substrate of the c-Met receptor. Gab-1 binds to c-Met phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, but not to a number of other tyrosine kinases from different subfamilies. A newly identified proline-rich domain of Gab-1 is responsible for the binding to the bidentate docking site in c-Met. Expression of Gab-1 in epithelial cells is sufficient to induce c-Met-specific cellular responses which include the formation of branching tubules. Thus, Gab-1 seem to correspond to the substrate of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates the epithelial morphogenesis.","title":"Role of HGF/SF and c-Met in morphogenesis and metastasis of epithelial cells.","pubmedId":"9524774"}
