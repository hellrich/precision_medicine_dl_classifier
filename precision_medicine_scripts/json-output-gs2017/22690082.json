Finally, 8 randomized control studies were included in the meta-analysis. STATA 10.0 Software was used to investigate heterogeneity among individual studies and to summarize all the studies. Risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association.\nCompared with 20 of 266 patients with loss of PTEN, 206 of 496 patients with intact PTEN protein expression had a better objective response rate to cetuximab-based therapy (RR, 4.75; 95% CI, 2.59-8.72; P \u003c 0.001). PTEN positivity was associated with better progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 0.675; 95% CI, 0.473-0.964; P \u003d 0.031) but not with better overall survival (OS) (HR, 0.608; 95% CI, 0.411-0.899; P \u003d 0.013). In patients with KRAS wild-type status, PTEN positivity did not predict a longer PFS or OS (PFS: HR, 0.707; 95% CI, 0.440-1.138; P \u003d 0.154; OS: HR, 0.943; 95% CI, 0.646-1.377; P \u003d 0.761).\nExpression of PTEN is related to the effect of cetuximab in colorectal cancer patients and should be considered in treatment with cetuximab.","title":"Phosphatase and tensin homolog expression related to cetuximab effects in colorectal cancer patients: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"22690082"}
