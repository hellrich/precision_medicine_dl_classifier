To clarify this point, we retrospectively explored whether KRAS mutations could impact tumor response, and disease control rate (DCR) to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (CT) as well as progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).\nBetween June 2009 and June 2012, 340 patients with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were reviewed in a single institution (Institut Gustave Roussy). Two hundred and one patients had a biomolecular profile and received a platinum-based first-line CT. Patients with an unknown mutational status or with actionable alterations were excluded. We retained two groups: patients with KRAS mutated tumor (MUT) and patients with wild-type KRAS/EGFR (WT). Multivariate analyses with Cox model were used. Survival curves were calculated with Kaplan-Meier method.\nOne hundred and eight patients were included in the analysis: 39 in the MUT group and 69 in the WT group. Baseline radiological assessment demonstrated more brain (P\u003d0.01) and liver (P\u003d0.04) metastases in MUT patients. DCR was 76% for MUT vs. 91% for WT group (P\u003d0.03), regardless of the type of platinum-based CT (use of pemetrexed or not). Although no statistically significant differences were found, shorter PFS (4.9 vs. 6.0 months; P\u003d0.79) and OS (10.3 vs. 13.2 months; P\u003d0.40) were observed for patients with KRAS mutated tumors in univariate analysis.\nKRAS mutant tumors had a lower DCR after the first-line platinum-based CT, but this difference did not translate in PFS or OS. The presence of KRAS mutations may confer a more aggressive disease, with greater baseline incidence of hepatic and cerebral metastases.","title":"Does KRAS mutational status predict chemoresistance in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)?","pubmedId":"24439569"}
