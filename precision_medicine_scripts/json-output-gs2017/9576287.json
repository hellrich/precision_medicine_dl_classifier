Recent studies have reported an increased risk of carcinoma of the pancreas in malignant melanoma-prone kindreds and have suggested a link between malignant melanoma and pancreas carcinoma and mutations in the p16INK4 gene. This study evaluates the risk of carcinoma of the pancreas in a population-based cohort of patients with malignant melanoma.\nThe malignant melanoma patients were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute. The cohort was followed within the SEER system to ascertain the occurrence of subsequent microscopically confirmed primary carcinoma of the pancreas from January 1973 through December 1993. The time of follow-up was expressed as person-years of observation. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.\nThere were 43,781 malignant melanoma patients providing 263,528 person-years of follow-up. A nearly 2-fold increased risk of subsequent carcinoma of the pancreas in patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma before age 50 years was observed (SIR \u003d 1.76; 95% CI \u003d 0.80-3.34) and the greatest estimated risk occurred in young white females (SIR \u003d 2.27; 95% CI \u003d 0.73-5.30).\nThese results provide some evidence in support of observations in recent studies that not only a family history of malignant melanoma but also malignant melanoma diagnosed at an early age may be associated with the subsequent development of carcinoma of the pancreas. Further research with larger numbers of melanoma patients is necessary to explore these potential associations.","title":"The risk of subsequent primary carcinoma of the pancreas in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"9576287"}
