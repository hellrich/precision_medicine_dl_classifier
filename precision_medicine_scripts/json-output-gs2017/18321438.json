{"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Surgical therapy remains the most effective modality in the treatment of gastric cancer. Staging laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasound may increase the accuracy of staging and prevent patients with unresectable gastric cancer from undergoing unnecessary operations. Resection of proximal and distal gastric cancer is best accomplished with an appropriate gastrectomy that ensures adequate resection margins. A D2 lymphadenectomy can be performed safely and facilitates the resection of the minimum 15 lymph nodes required for adequate staging. Adjacent organ resection should be used only in highly selected patients with R0 resection as the goal. Palliative operations offer improved quality of life and symptom relief in patients with metastatic disease. Appreciation of postoperative quality of life after gastric resection facilitates appropriate and effective preoperative counseling. Surgical outcomes may be influenced by hospital volume and rate of adequate lymph node assessment.","title":"Surgical management of gastric cancer: review and consideration for total care of the gastric cancer patient.","pubmedId":"18321438"}
