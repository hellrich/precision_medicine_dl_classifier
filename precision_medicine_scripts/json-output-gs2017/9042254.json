Here we describe a rare case of malignant neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor with multiple metastases in different organs showing strong positivity for synaptophysin, glucagon-like peptide 1, pan-cytokeratin, moderate positivity for chromogranin, Phe-5 and calcitonin and weak positivity for vasointestinal peptide. We found a point mutation at codon 61 of the c-N-ras oncogene, and point mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in the primary tumor as well as in its metastases in liver. The mutation in the c-N-ras gene was a cytosine to adenine transversion, resulting in the amino-acid lysine. Allele specific hybridization showed that the mutation involved one of two c-N-ras alleles as the oligonucleotide for the normal codon also hybridized to amplified tumor DNA. Concomitant mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene at codons 248 and 249 was found. The mutation in codon 248 was a cytosine to guanine transversion resulting in the amino-acid glycine. The mutation in codon 249 was a third base, G- \u003e T, transversion leading to a change from arginine to serine. This is the first time that concomitant point mutations in c-N-ras and p53 have been found in a neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor. Based upon these and our previous results, we concluded that these genetic changes may play a role in the development of this particular pancreatic tumor.","title":"Concomitant point mutation of tumor suppressor gene p53 and oncogene c-N-ras in malignant neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor.","pubmedId":"9042254"}
