The most common indications were adenocarcinoma (28%), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN; 20%), and endocrine neoplasms (17%). Two-way statistical comparisons were performed between patients who did (EUS(+)) or did not (EUS(-)) undergo preoperative EUS-FNA.\nDistal pancreatectomy was performed open in 118 patients (56%) and laparoscopically in 102 patients (44%). No differences were observed in age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, operative time, or blood loss between the EUS(+) (n \u003d 179) and EUS(-) (n \u003d 51) groups. Splenectomy was performed in 162 patients (70%) and was more common in the EUS(+) group. With the exception of adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 57 [32%] EUS(+) vs n \u003d 6 [12%] EUS(-); P \u003c .01), the final pathologic diagnosis did not differ significantly between the EUS groups. Postoperative complications were more common in the EUS(+) patients with cystic neoplasms (43% vs 16% EUS(-); P \u003d .04). EUS-FNA caused pancreatitis in 2 patients preoperatively. No differences in overall or recurrence-free survival were noted between cancer patients in the EUS groups. Patterns of tumor recurrence were not associated with EUS-FNA.\nPreoperative EUS-FNA is not associated with adverse perioperative or long-term outcomes in patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy for solid neoplasms of the pancreas. The potentially detrimental long-term impact of preoperative EUS-FNA in patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma was not observed, but will require additional study.","title":"Outcomes after preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography and biopsy in patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy.","pubmedId":"22000199"}
