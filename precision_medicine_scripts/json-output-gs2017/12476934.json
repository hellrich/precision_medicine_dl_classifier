Oestrogens and mitogenic growth factors may play an important role in the development of breast cancer, whereas inhibitory growth factors may prevent the development of breast cancer. Only about 5 to 10% of cases of breast cancer are due to inheritance of mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumour suppressor genes. Mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene are commonly found in sporadic breast cancers. Retinoic acid and carotenoids may play a protective role in breast cancer since they inhibit the growth of the oestrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The presence of oestrogen and progesterone receptors predicts the likelihood of benefit from hormonal therapy. Amplification of the c-erbB2 oncogene in breast cancers is associated with a poor prognosis. It is now apparent that there is a complex, productive cross-talk between oestrogen-directed and growth factor-directed pathways which are believed to markedly reinforce their individual cellular effects on growth and gene responses.","title":"Role of steroid hormones and growth factors in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"12476934"}
