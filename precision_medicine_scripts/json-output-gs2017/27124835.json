The selective CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib inhibits growth and induces senescence in liposarcoma cell lines and xenografts. Our prior phase 2 study demonstrated that treatment with palbociclib (200 mg daily for 14 days every 21 days) resulted in clinical benefit in WD/DDLS but moderate hematologic toxic effects. It is important to understand whether palbociclib at a new dose and schedule-125 mg daily for 21 days every 28 days-results in clinical benefit and manageable toxic effects.\nTo determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 weeks of patients with WD/DDLS treated with palbociclib (PD0332991).\nIn this phase 2, nonrandomized, open-label clinical trial conducted at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 60 patients 18 years and older with advanced WD/DDLS and measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 were enrolled from December 2011 to January 2014 and followed to March 2015. Patients received oral palbociclib at 125 mg daily for 21 days in 28-day cycles.\nPrimary end point was PFS. Secondary end points included response rate and toxic effects.\nOverall, 30 patients were enrolled in the initial cohort and 30 more in an expansion cohort. Median (range) age was 61.5 (35-87) years; 31 patients (52%) were male; median (range) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score was 0 (0-1). Progression-free survival at 12 weeks was 57.2% (2-sided 95% CI, 42.4%-68.8%), and the median PFS was 17.9 weeks (2-sided 95% CI, 11.9-24.0 weeks). There was 1 complete response. Toxic effects were primarily hematologic and included neutropenia (grade 3, n \u003d 20 [33%]; grade 4, n \u003d 2 [3%]) but no neutropenic fever.\nIn patients with advanced WD/DDLS, treatment with palbociclib was associated with a favorable PFS and occasional tumor response. This dose and schedule appears active and may have less toxic effects than 200 mg for 14 days.\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01209598.","title":"Progression-Free Survival Among Patients With Well-Differentiated or Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma Treated With CDK4 Inhibitor Palbociclib: A Phase 2 Clinical Trial.","pubmedId":"27124835"}
