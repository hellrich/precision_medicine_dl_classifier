Cholangiocarcinoma arose from the extrahepatic bile duct in one and from the dilated intrahepatic bile duct in two patients. Hyperplasia of the columnar cells was often present. These hyperplastic epithelial cells often show papillomatous or adenomatous pattern, which are frequently associated with the presence of stones and the contaminated bile, and may show malignant changes leading to the development of cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Hepatolithiasis associated with cholangiocarcinoma.
