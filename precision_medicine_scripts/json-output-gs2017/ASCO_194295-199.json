The prognosis for patients is poor and depends on the clinical stage and the histological type of cancer. There is a need to identify and develop new therapeutic targets that could improve the prognosis of NSCLC patients and may be responsible for development of resistance to TKI therapy. Increased expression of Fn14 or CD44v and EGFR was observed in many tumors and also correlated with the overall survival of NSCLC patients Methods: We analyzed the clinical data and the immunohistochemical expression of Fn14, CD44v and EGFR in tumor tissues from 61 patients with NSCLC divided in two groups according to the presence of activating EGFR gene mutation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation between the expression of the studied molecules and the neoplastic disease course of NSCLC patients. Results: Increased expression of Fn14 was observed in study group (B) compared to expression of this molecule in the control group (K). There were no differences in the intensity of the reaction with anti CD44v and EGFR antibodies in both groups. OS was significantly longer in the study group. Histological grade of tumor correlated with the intensity of CD44v expression in both groups. There was no correlation between the OS and Fn14 expression in any group. Negative correlation was noted between the expression of CD44v and the OS in the study group and between EGFR expression and the OS in both groups. Conclusions: Our observations suggest that the expression of CD44v and EGFR may be useful clinical markers of prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma patients regardless of the presence of activating mutation in EGFR gene. Simultaneous assessment of Cd44v and EGFR expression may grant a greater prognostic value than the assessment of each receptor separately. Increased expression of Fn14 receptor in patients with EGFR gene mutation may become a new target in therapy allowing to eliminate the problem of secondary resistance to treatment with TKIs","title":"The value of Fn14, CD44v, and EGFR expression in lung adenocarcinoma patients with and without activating EGFR gene mutation.","pubmedId":"ASCO_194295-199"}
