TTF-1 expression was observed in all cases but was not seen in mucinogenic growths in CPAM. CDX2 expression was completely negative. MUC1 expression was noted in 12 (29%) CPAM and in 33% sequestrations. MUC5AC was noted in only five cases (26%) by immunohistochemistry and was found in the mucinogenic proliferations of type 1 CPAM. No immunolabelling was noted for the other mucins. EGFR was expressed variably in almost all cases, while HER2 and CK20 was seen exclusively in the mucinogenic proliferations. All mucinous growths were characterized by KRAS mutations. No EGFR and HER2 gene alterations were identified.\n  KRAS mutations and MUC5AC, CK20 and HER2 expression was seen in all mucinogenic proliferations, supporting the neoplastic nature of these cytologically bland growths. These findings emphasize the importance of complete surgical resection of such lesions.","title":"MUC5AC, cytokeratin 20 and HER2 expression and K-RAS mutations within mucinogenic growth in congenital pulmonary airway malformations.","pubmedId":"22348416"}
