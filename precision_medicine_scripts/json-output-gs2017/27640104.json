They most commonly occur in the female reproductive organs and upper aero digestive tract. They are relatively rare in the gastrointestinal tract and affect the oesophagus most commonly. Ampullary carcinosarcomas are exceptionally rare. We report a case of ampullary carcinosarcoma in a 67-year-old male, with osteosarcomatous, small cell carcinoma and conventional adenocarcinoma components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of its kind.","title":"Ampullary carcinosarcoma with osteosarcomatous, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and conventional adenocarcinoma components; First report.","pubmedId":"27640104"}
