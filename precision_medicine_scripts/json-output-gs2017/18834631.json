We report that both protective and therapeutic anti-tumor immune responses can be achieved in a mouse leukemia/lymphoma tumor model through the strong adjuvant effects provided by allogeneic CD3/CD28 cross-linked Th1 memory cells. The adjuvant effect of these cells is mediated by their ability to produce a variety of \u0027danger signals\u0027 which serve to deviate native non-protective Th2 anti-leukemia immune responses to effective Th1 immune responses.","title":"Allogeneic CD3/CD28 cross-linked Th1 memory cells provide potent adjuvant effects for active immunotherapy of leukemia/lymphoma.","pubmedId":"18834631"}
