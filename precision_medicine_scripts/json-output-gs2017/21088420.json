The following factors seem to have no influence on survival after pancreas resection: age, blood loss and transfusion requirements following resection, location of tumor, and type of resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy after R0 resection is standard: gemcitabine seems to be superior to 5-FU or no therapy. Nevertheless, only a few patients survive for at least 5 years after R0 resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Most patients need palliative treatment. Besides best supportive care including nutritional support, therapy for pain and endoscopic treatment of jaundice, gemcitabine is standard in both locally advanced and metastatic disease. The addition of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib prolongs median survival for only 2 weeks. Erlotinib has only beneficial effects in patients who develop a skin rash. None of the studied combinations of various therapies have demonstrated any additional benefits.\nThere are no real medical breakthroughs with regards to improving the prognosis of pancreatic cancer.","title":"What\u0027s new in therapy of pancreatic cancer?","pubmedId":"21088420"}
