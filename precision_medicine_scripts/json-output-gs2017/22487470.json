Next, we found that eight genes (S100P, PLAT, PLAU, MSLN, MMP-11, MMP-7, KRT7, KRT17) were significantly over expressed in pancreatic cancer samples when compared to pseudotumoural chronic pancreatitis (p value ranging from 0.0007 to 0.0215): Linear discriminative analysis identified S100P, PLAT, MSLN, MMP-7, KRT7 as highly explicative variables. The area under receiver operating curve establishes the clinical validity of the potential diagnostic markers identified in this study (values ranging from 0.69 to 0.76). In addition, combination of S100P and KRT7 gave better diagnosis performances (Area Under Receiver Operating Curve 0.81, sensitivity 81%, specificity 77%).\nWe demonstrate that molecular studies on EUS-guided FNA material are feasible for the identification and quantification of markers in PDAC patients diagnosed with non-resectable tumours. Using low-density array, we isolated a molecular signature of advanced pancreatic carcinoma including mostly cancer invasion-related genes. This work stems for the use of novel biomarkers for the molecular diagnosis of patient with solid pancreatic masses.","title":"Gene expression signature of advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using low density array on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration samples.","pubmedId":"22487470"}
