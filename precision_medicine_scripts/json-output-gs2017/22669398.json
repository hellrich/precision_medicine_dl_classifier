Its prognostic value is controversial.\nBetween May 1988 and Oct 2003, a total of 214 gastric cancer patients undergoing curative surgery were enrolled, and their MSI statuses were classified as MSI-H (high) or MSI-L/S (low/stable). The clinicopathologic characteristics of MSI-H and MSI-L/S gastric cancers were compared.\nThe MSI-H tumors accounted for 11.7 % (n \u003d 25) of the 214 total gastric cancers. Although not statistically significant, the MSI-H gastric cancers were more frequently located in the lower third of the stomach (64 % vs. 49.2 %) and were more often the intestinal type (72 % vs. 61.4 %) compared to the MSI-L/S gastric cancers. The MSI-H gastric cancers had a significantly better 5-year overall survival (OS) rate (68 % vs. 47.6 %, p \u003d 0.030) and a trend of a better 3-year disease-free survival rate (71.8 % vs. 55.2 %, p \u003d 0.076) compared to the MSI-L/S gastric cancers. A multivariate analysis revealed that pathologic TNM stage and MSI status were the independent prognostic factors for OS after curative surgery.\nCompared to MSI-L/S tumors, MSI-H tumors are associated with a better OS rate for gastric cancer patients after R0 resection.","title":"Microsatellite instability is associated with a better prognosis for gastric cancer patients after curative surgery.","pubmedId":"22669398"}
