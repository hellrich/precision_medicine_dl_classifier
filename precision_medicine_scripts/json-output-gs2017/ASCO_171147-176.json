Both younger and older patients have a higher risk of mortality. In this study we examined the intrinsic breast cancer subtypes and survival outcomes in breast cancer patients aged \u003c 35 years \u003e 75 years. Methods: Medical records of patients with breast cancer who were aged \u003c 35 or \u003e 75 years at diagnosis were retrospectively reviewed. Intrinsic breast cancer subtypes were determined in accordance with St. Gallen surrogate molecular subtype definitions. Results: 212 patients aged \u003c 35 and 75 patients aged \u003e 75 were included. Median age was 33.2 (range 21  34.9) in the younger group and 77.8 (range 75  88.1) in the older group. 9.4% of younger group and 18.3% of older patients were metastatic at diagnosis (p:0.04). T3 or T4 tumors were present in 19.8% and 10% of patients in younger and older patients, respectively (p:0.078). N2/N3 disease was present in 45% of younger and 50.8% of older groups. Luminal A was the most common subtype (40.5%) in the older group, whereas luminal B was the most common subtype (50.6%) in the younger group (p: \u003c 0.001). Frequency of HER2 positive (11.1% in younger vs. 17.6% in older) and triple-negative subtypes (21% in younger vs. 13.5% in older) were not significantly different. In both younger and older groups, breast cancer specific survival was superior in luminal (A+B) subtype compared to HER2 positive and triple-negative subtypes. Conclusions: Breast cancer subtype frequencies differ between younger ( \u003c 35 years) and older ( \u003e 75 years) patients. The most common subtypes are luminal A in older patients and luminal B in younger patients. For both older and younger patients, breast cancer subtypes have an important prognostic impact","title":"A Retrospective Comparative Study Of Intrinsic Moleculer Breast Cancer Subtypes Between Young And Elderly Women With Breast Cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_171147-176"}
