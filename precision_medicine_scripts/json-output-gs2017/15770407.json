Local recurrence, liver metastases, and peritoneal spread are the most common recurrent patterns after curative resection of pancreatic cancer. We report a patient who suffered from gastric metastasis secondary to pancreatic adenocarcinoma 1 year after pancreatectomy. A 49-year-old woman underwent distal pancreatectomy with intraoperative radiation therapy for cancer of the body of the pancreas in October 2002. The histological diagnosis was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, stage IIB; T1N1M0. Multiple liver metastases were detected on computed tomography (CT) in March 2003. Combination chemotherapy of 5-fluorouracil hepatic arterial continuous infusion and systemic gemcitabine administration led to the disappearance of the liver metastases on CT in September 2003. One month later, she complained of epigastric pain and underwent gastric endoscopy, which revealed a submucosal tumor in the fornix posterior wall. Histological diagnosis of the biopsy specimen was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and immunohistochemical studies, using anti-cytokeratin 7 and -20 monoclonal antibodies, were compatible with gastric metastasis from pancreatic carcinoma. A F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan revealed a high-uptake lesion, which coincided with the gastric tumor. No other abnormal uptake could be found. Histopatholoical examination of the resected specimen revealed submucosal growth of the metastatic cancer (well-differentiated adenocarcinoma).","title":"Metastatic gastric tumor secondary to pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"15770407"}
