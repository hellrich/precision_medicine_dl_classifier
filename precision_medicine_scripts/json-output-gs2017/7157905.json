Indication was severe chronic pancreatitis in 17 cases, cancer of the ampulla of Vater in 4 cases and cancer of the duodenum in 1 case. 1 patient (duodenal cancer) died because of necrosis of the residual pancreas. The treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency does not create problems. Only patients presenting with preoperative latent diabetic metabolism seem to develop postoperatively a manifest Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The obtained results are very satisfactory and justify to conclude that this operative procedure gives real help to patients with severe chronic relapsing pancreatitis.","title":"[Partial duodenopancreatectomy and intraoperative occlusion of the pancreatic duct: preliminary results].","pubmedId":"7157905"}
