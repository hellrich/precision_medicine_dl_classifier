Several polymorphisms have been identified in the MKK4 gene. We hypothesized that genetic variants in the MKK4 promoter may alter its functions and thus cancer risk. In the current, hospital-based case-control study of 471 cervical cancer cases and 600 sex and age frequency-matched cancer-free controls in an Eastern Chinese population, we genotyped two common polymorphisms in the MKK4 promoter region (-1304T\u003eG, rs3826392 and -1044A\u003eT, rs3809728)c and assessed their associations with the risk of cervical cancer. We found that compared with the most common -1304TT genotype, carriers of -1304G variant genotypes had a significantly decreased risk of cervical cancer [odds ratio (OR) \u003d 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) \u003d 0.53-0.92 for TG, and OR \u003d 0.52; 95%CI \u003d 0.30-0.91 for GG] in an allele dose-response manner (adjusted P(trend) \u003d 0.004). Moreover, the luciferase assay showed that the G allele in the promoter significantly increased the transcription activity of the MKK4 gene in vitro and that the MKK4 mRNA expression levels of the G variant carriers was significantly higher in tumor tissues than those of the -1304TT genotype. However, no significant association was observed between the -1044A\u003eT polymorphism and risk of cervical cancer. Our data suggest that the functional -1304G variant in the MKK4 promoter contributes to a decreased risk of cervical cancer by increasing the promoter activity and that the G variant may be a marker for susceptibility to cervical cancer.","title":"The association between -1304T\u003eG polymorphism in the promoter of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 gene and the risk of cervical cancer in Chinese population.","pubmedId":"22335172"}
