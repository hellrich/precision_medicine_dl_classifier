This study aims to investigate the potential association of MDM2 c.346G\u003eA genetic variant with the risk of osteosarcoma in Chinese. A total of 738 subjects were recruited in this study. The genotypes of MDM2 c.346G\u003eA genetic variant were detected by the created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction. Our data suggest that the MDM2 c.346G\u003eA genetic variant is associated with the increased risk of osteosarcoma in the homozygote comparison (AA vs. GG: odds ratio [OR]\u003d2.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-4.28, χ2\u003d8.35, p\u003d0.004), recessive model (AA vs.\nOR\u003d2.32, 95% CI 1.30-4.13, χ2\u003d8.50, p\u003d0.004), and allele comparison (A vs. G: OR\u003d1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.60, χ2\u003d4.34, p\u003d0.037). Results from this study indicated that the allele-A and genotype-AA of MDM2 c.346G\u003eA genetic variant could be an increased risk factor for the susceptibility to osteosarcoma and might be used as a potential molecular marker for evaluating the risk of osteosarcoma.","title":"The association of MDM2 c.346G\u003eA genetic variant with the risk of osteosarcoma in Chinese.","pubmedId":"25551700"}
