Transformation and progression towards malignancy in prostate cancer is dependant on the inability of the prostatic epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis rather than on the regulation of proliferation. Molecular targeting of inadequacies in this process of suppression of apoptosis could prove to be of great therapeutic importance for prostate cancer patients. Existence of tissue specific promoters to aid in the delivery of genes with therapeutic potential makes molecular therapy an attractive option. This review discusses salient features of molecules such as, Bcl-2, Bcl-(XL), NF-kappaB, Akt, PTEN and Par-4 that play a significant role in the regulation of prostate cancer and focuses on the prospects of effectively utilizing their potential for the therapy of hormone-sensitive and hormone-resistant prostate cancer.","title":"Molecular therapy intervention prospects in prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"14965337"}
