A recombinant HSV-I plasmid encoding the GALV.fus was transfected into green monkey kidney cells, the lung adenocarcinoma line A549, and the human fetal fibroblast cell line HFL-I GNHu5 in various doses. The effects and expression of in vitro GALV.fus were observed using an inverted microscope. Enhanced green fluorescence protein expression served as the contro1 for GALV.fus. Recombinant HSV-I virus was produced. Fusogenic recombinant virus infection led to cell fusions in A549 in a dose-dependent manner. Nonfusogenic viruses only produced conventional cytotoxic effects. Recombinant HSV-I with the CMVP initiated cell fusions in HFL-1 GNHu5 cells with arrested cell cycles or as quiescence. HSV-I regulated by UL38p caused cell fusion only in growing cells. Protein expression of GALV.fus was confirmed by Western Blot in infected A549 and HFL-1 GNHu5. Delivery and tumor-specific expression of GALV.fus gene can selectively and safely target lung cancer in vitro, and may prove to be a novel gene therapy for lung cancer.
