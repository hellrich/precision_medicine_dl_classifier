Allelic deletion spanning the CDKN locus was observed at significantly increased rates moving from early (7%) to advanced (28%) primary melanomas and to secondary melanoma lesions (37%) (P\u003d0.018). Also, inactivation of the p16 gene (CDKN2A) was absent in naevi and present at steadily increasing rates moving from primary melanomas (7% early lesions to 17% advanced lesions) to melanoma metastases (62%) (P\u003d0.004).\nOur findings indicate that, in a model of sequential accumulation of genetic alterations, 9p21 deletions may play a role in melanocytic transformation and tumour initiation whereas rearrangements at the CDKN locus, and p16 gene (CDKN2A) inactivation may contribute to tumour progression.","title":"Molecular alterations at chromosome 9p21 in melanocytic naevi and melanoma.","pubmedId":"18028495"}
