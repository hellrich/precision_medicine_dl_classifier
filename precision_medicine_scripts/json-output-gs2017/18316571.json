We previously have shown that RNA interference targeting the HMGA1 gene may represent a potential chemosensitizing strategy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HMGA1 promotes chemoresistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells.\nStable short hairpin RNA-mediated HMGA1 silencing in BxPC3 and MiaPaCa2 cells promoted chemosensitivity to gemcitabine, with reductions in gemcitabine IC(50) and increases in gemcitabine-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. In contrast, forced HMGA1 overexpression in MiaPaCa2 cells promoted chemoresistance to gemcitabine, with increases in gemcitabine IC(50) and reductions in gemcitabine-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Dominant negative Akt abrogated HMGA1 overexpression-induced increases in chemoresistance to gemcitabine. Finally, HMGA1 silencing promoted chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in vivo in a nude mouse xenograft model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nOur findings suggest that HMGA1 promotes chemoresistance to gemcitabine through an Akt-dependent mechanism. Targeted therapies directed at HMGA1 represent a potential strategy for ameliorating chemoresistance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"HMGA1 is a molecular determinant of chemoresistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18316571"}
