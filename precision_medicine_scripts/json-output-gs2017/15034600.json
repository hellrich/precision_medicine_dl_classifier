Currently for example, it is not clear whether the androgen-independent phenotype is a result of selection of a subgroup of genetically distinct prostate tumour cells which are already hormone-resistant or a genetic adaptation of prostate tumour cells to the hormone therapy itself. It has also been established that prostate tumour transformation is a result of homeostatic control defects, a line of thinking directed toward elucidating the apoptotic profile of prostate tumour cells that may be important in determining prognosis, response to therapy and illness progression. Main consideration in this part of rewiev is given to the role of tumour suppressor genes pRb and PTEN and also the natural inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases - proteins p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1). Attention is also given to the role of FAS-mediated pathways in apoptosis induction.","title":"The significance of key regulators of apoptosis in the development and prognosis of prostate carcinoma.
