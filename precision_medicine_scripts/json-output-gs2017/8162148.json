Two cases of ossificated spinal cord meningiomas, located extramedullary intradurally apart from spinal bone, were clinicopathologically analyzed. The patients were 75-year-old female with meningioma at T9-10 level and 60-year-old female with one at T6-8 level. With pathological examination, concentration of psammoma bodies is not related to the formation of bone tissue. Metaplasia of arachnoid cell is seemed to be the origin of the bone structure.","title":"[Clinicopathologic analysis of ossification in spinal meningioma].","pubmedId":"8162148"}
