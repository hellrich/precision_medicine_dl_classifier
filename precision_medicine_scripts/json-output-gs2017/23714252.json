Twenty-five (80.6%) tumors contained functional mutations of p53; three frameshift, four nonsense and 19 missense mutations. None of the tumors showed KRAS, BRAF or CTNNB1 mutation. In all 18 tumors with missense mutations, ≥60% of tumor cells were strongly positive for p53 immunostaining whereas all tumors with frameshift or nonsense mutations were completely negative. Missense mutation was correlated with diffuse and strong imunoreaction and frameshift/nonsense mutation was correlated with completely negative immunoreaction (P \u003d 0.000). Tumors with wild-type p53 revealed a wide range of immunostaining patterns. In 27 (87.1%) and 18 (58.1%) tumors, ≥50% of tumor cells were moderate to strongly positive for WT1 and p16, respectively. A considerable intratumoral heterogeneity for p16 expression was present. None of the tumors demonstrated nuclear beta-catenin expression. p53 mutations appear to be a powerful molecular marker for ovarian high-grade serous adenocarcinoma. Using p53 with an appropriate interpretation criteria together with WT1, p16 and beta-catenin, most of the high-grade serous adenocarcinoma could be distinguished from other ovarian tumors.","title":"Genetic alteration and immunohistochemical staining patterns of ovarian high-grade serous adenocarcinoma with special emphasis on p53 immnnostaining pattern.","pubmedId":"23714252"}
