Pancreatic exocrine function was determined by fecal elastase 1. MRCP images were evaluated according to the Cambridge classification. MRI of the pancreas was assessed for pancreatic size, signal intensity ratio (SIR), and arterial/venous enhancement ratio (A/V).\nOn MRI, significant difference was present in terms of mean values of pancreatic size (P\u003c0.0001), A/V (P\u003c0.02), and SIR (P\u003c0.005) between the control group and groups of patients with DM, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and combined DM and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. No significant difference was observed between groups of patients with DM and pancreatic exocrine function alone in terms of pancreatic size, A/V, and SIR. Chronic pancreatitis MRCP findings were present with increasing frequency in groups of DM, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and combination of both.\nMRI/MRCP findings suggesting chronic pancreatitis may exist in patients with DM comparable to patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. The frequency and severity of MRI/MRCP findings increase when the patients have combined DM and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.","title":"MRI and MRCP findings of the pancreas in patients with diabetes mellitus: compared analysis with pancreatic exocrine function determined by fecal elastase 1.","pubmedId":"18797409"}
