The dog was treated by two single-agent chemotherapy separately. The patient was an 8-year-old, male Dachshund, and was referred to our hospital owing to the significant distention of the left abdomen. Neither radiography nor ultrasonography detected the actual association of the tumor with the abdominal viscera before surgery. A large-sized tumor mass that adhered to the mesojejunoileum was explored by laparatomy. Final diagnosis of a pleomorphic liposarcoma was made by the routine histology and further identified by Oil Red O stain. The two single-agent chemotherapy including doxorubicin followed by capecitabine, however, failed to cause remission of the intrahepatic metastatic lesions. The patient died 22 months after operation and the cause of death was supposed to be metastatic liposarcoma.","title":"Mesojejunoileac liposarcoma with intrahepatic metastasis in a dog.","pubmedId":"18628610"}
