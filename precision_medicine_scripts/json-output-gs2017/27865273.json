In addition to the commonly recognized genetic drivers of pancreatic carcinogenesis (KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, SMAD4), new genes and pathways have been implicated. However, these efforts have not identified any new high-frequency actionable mutations, limiting the success of mutation-targeted therapy in PDA. This article provides a report on the current landscape of pancreas cancer genetics and targeted therapeutics.","title":"Genetics of Pancreatic Cancer and Its Implications on Therapy.","pubmedId":"27865273"}
