We report a novel case of a colon adenocarcinoma with rhabdoid features in a 71-year-old woman, localized to the right colon and associated with local lymph node and liver metastasis. The patient died within 8 months from surgery despite target chemotherapy. The tumor was enriched in cells with a typical rhabdoid-type morphology displaying a marked and diffuse vimentin staining. Cells were also positive for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p53, Ki67, and β-catenin and negative for cytokeratin 20/cytokeratin 7, E-cadherin, and CDX2. Remarkably, the promoter regions of 4 of 5 specific genes that define the so-called \"CpG island methylator phenotype,\" including mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), were methylated. Consistently, microsatellite instability was detected. A BRAF V600E mutation and no KRAS mutations were identified. Finally, 4 tumor suppressor gene promoters CDH1, CDKN1B, CDKN1C, and MGMT were not methylated. This is the first case of a colorectal carcinoma with rhabdoid features, \"CpG island methylator phenotype,\" high microsatellite instability associated with a BRAF mutation, and patient poorer outcome.","title":"A novel case of rhabdoid colon carcinoma associated with a positive CpG island methylator phenotype and BRAF mutation.","pubmedId":"21315413"}
