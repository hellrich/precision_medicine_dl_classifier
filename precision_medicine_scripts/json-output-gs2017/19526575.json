We herein report two such cases in two asymptomatic women. Case 1. A Pap smear of a 16-year-old-female showed rare glandular cells with cytologic features consistent with Cytomegalovirus infection. Case 2. A Pap smear of a 36-year-old female exhibited rare fungal organisms characterized by thin septate hyphae branching into secondary branches (metulae) which carried multiple flask-shaped philiades most consistent with Penicillium species that were \"most likely representing contamination.\" We discuss the cytomorphological features and the differential diagnosis and provide a brief review of the literature on these topics.","title":"Unusual microbial organisms seen in two cervical smears.","pubmedId":"19526575"}
