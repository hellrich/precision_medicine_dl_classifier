There are some indications in the literature that the use of dopamine antagonists can lightly increase the risk of developing breast cancer. So far there is insufficient scientific evidence to justify alterations in the standard treatment strategy simply on the grounds that a woman has a family history of breast cancer. We do however recommend that women in this risk category be tested periodically for possible breast cancer.","title":"[Breast cancer in the family: a possible contra-indication to the use of dopamine antagonists.
