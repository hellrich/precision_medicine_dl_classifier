We estimated cost-effectiveness of multiplexed predictive biomarker screening in metastatic NSCLC from a societal perspective in the United States.\nWe constructed a microsimulation model to compare the life expectancy and costs of multiplexed testing and molecularly guided therapy versus treatment with cisplatin-pemetrexed (CisPem). All testing interventions included a two-step algorithm of concurrent EGFR mutation and ALK overexpression testing with immunohistochemistry followed by ALK rearrangement confirmation with a fluorescence in situ hybridization assay for immunohistochemistry-positive results. Three strategies were included: \"Test-treat\" approach, where molecularly guided therapy was initiated after obtainment of test results; \"Empiric switch therapy,\" with concurrent initiation of CisPem and testing and immediate switch to test-result conditional treatment after one cycle of CisPem; and \"Empiric therapy\" approach in which CisPem was continued for four cycles before start of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\nThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for \"Test-treat\" compared with treatment with CisPem was $136,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Both empiric treatment approaches had less favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. \"Test-treat\" and \"Empiric switch therapy\" yielded higher expected outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years and life-years than \"Empiric therapy.\" These results were robust across plausible ranges of model inputs.\nFrom a societal perspective, our cost-effectiveness results support the value of multiplexed genetic screening and molecularly guided therapy in metastatic NSCLC.","title":"Cost-effectiveness of multiplexed predictive biomarker screening in non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25590606"}
