Hematopathologic findings were subtle and did not definitively indicate malignancy. Because he responded poorly to initial treatment with hydroxyurea, and in light of the progressive clinical course associated with the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome, he underwent an unrelated-donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This patient\u0027s atypical presentation highlights the importance of obtaining cytogenetic analysis at the time of bone marrow sampling and considering this uncommon entity in the differential diagnosis of hematologic disorders.","title":"Favorable outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome associated with BCR-FGFR1 gene fusion.","pubmedId":"22106025"}
