The effect of both compounds on the selenoprotein M level was investigated, as well as the association between the expression level of selenoprotein M and the patients\u0027 clinicopathological data. Se and SeMet inhibited CCA cell growth with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 1.7-2.1 μM and 18.8-37.9 μM, respectively. Both compounds increased the ratio of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) to BCL2-associated X (BAX), triggering apoptotic cell death, and inhibited cell migration by reducing the ratio of N-cadherin to E-cadherin, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker. In addition, Se and SeMet increased selenoprotein M protein in CCA cells. Low expression of selenoprotein M in CCA tissues was significantly associated with shorter patient survival. In conclusion, selenium may potentially be an alternative anticancer agent that might lead to a better prognosis in patients with CCA.","title":"Potential of Selenium Compounds as New Anticancer Agents for Cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27793924"}
