This study was undertaken to explore the diagnosis and clinicopathological characteristics of cHCC-CC in comparison with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC), respectively.\nThe clinical data from 15 patients with cHCC-CC, 132 patients with HCC and 44 patients with CC who had undergone hepatic resection were analyzed retrospectively. Clinicopathological characteristics of cHCC-CC, HCC and CC such as hepatitis B viral infection, serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, cirrhosis, vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, surgical procedure and adjuvant treatment were also analyzed. Follow up was carried out in the patients, and their 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were calculated.\nTwo patients with cHCC-CC were correctly diagnosed by enhanced CT before operation, the other 13 patients were diagnosed by histology and immunohistochemistry after operation. Radical (8/15) and conservative hepatectomy (7/15) for cHCC-CC was similar to that for HCC and CC (P\u003e0.05). Pathologically cHCC-CC showed more significantly vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis than HCC (P\u003c0.05), and a similarity to CC (P\u003e0.05). Hepatitis B viral infection, serum HCV antibody, cirrhosis, and serum AFP level of cHCC-CC patients were similar to those of HCC patients (P\u003e0.05) but different from CC patients (P\u003c0.05). The cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in patients with cHCC-CC were poorer than in patients with HCC or CC (P\u003c0.05).\nPatients with cHCC-CC are seldom diagnosed before operation. The progression of cHCC-CC is more rapid than that of HCC or CC. Survival rate of patients with cHCC-CC after hepatic resection is poorer than that of patients with HCC or CC.","title":"Clinicopathological characteristics of 15 patients with combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"17374575"}
