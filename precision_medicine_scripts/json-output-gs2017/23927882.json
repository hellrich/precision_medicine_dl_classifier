The usefulness of immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a new approach for the detection of BRAF V600E in cancer patients has been recently reported.\nTo increase the sensitivity, we modified BRAF V600E expression detection assay by IHC using mutation specific antibody. From the screening step, we found a novel 599 insertion T BRAF mutation in lung adenocarcinoma. In this study included 26 surgically removed cases with EGFR, Kras, erbB2, EML4-ALK and KIF5B-RET wild-type (wt) lung adenocarcinomas, including 7 BRAF mutants (5 V600E, 1 N581I, and 1 novel 599 insertion T mutation) analyzed by DNA sequencing. Detection of the BRAF V600E mutation was carried out by the Dako EnVisionâ„¢ FLEX detection system using the VE1 clone antibody and compared with the results of direct sequencing.\nThe autostainer IHC VE1 assay was positive in 5 of 5 (100%) BRAF V600E-mutated tumors and negative in 20 of 21 (95.2%) BRAF non-V600E tumors, except for a novel 599 insertion T case.\nIHC using the VE1 clone and FLEX linker is a specific method for the detection BRAF V600E and may be an alternative to molecular biology for the detection of mutations in lung adenocarcinomas. This method might be useful for screening to use molecular target therapy for lung adenocarcinomas.","title":"Usefulness of immunohistochemistry for the detection of the BRAF V600E mutation in Japanese lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23927882"}
