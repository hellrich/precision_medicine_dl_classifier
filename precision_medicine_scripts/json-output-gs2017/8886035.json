Their response rates were 15, 12, 24 and 24%, respectively. Several trials of combination chemotherapy using mitomycin C, doxorubicin and 5-FU (FAM) were performed, but their response rates did not go exceed those of single agents. Recently, the goal of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer is thought to be quality of life. Combination of 5-FU and cisplatin or 5-FU, leucovorin and alpha interferon were effective for the prolongation of life with less toxicities. Their median survival times were 7.6 months, and 22 months in PR cases, respectively. CPT-11, gemcitabine, taxotere and BOF-A2 are promising new drugs for their effectiveness and benefits for patients with pancreatic cancer. Combination of mitomycin C, carboquone and 5-FU with angiotensin II was effective in terms of antitumor effect and prolongation of life. Generally, a large number of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer cannot receive chemotherapy because of deterioration in performance status. For them, combination of continuous venous infusion of low-dose 5-FU and low-dose cisplatin could be effective. The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer must await new agents and methodology in the future.","title":"[Chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer].","pubmedId":"8886035"}
