Thoracic radiographs demonstrated right-sided pleural effusion and lobar vesicular emphysema. An exploratory thoracotomy revealed midlobar torsion of the right caudal lung lobe. A partial lung lobectomy was performed, and following surgery, the dog recovered without complications. Lung lobe torsions in dogs typically occur at the hilus of the affected lung lobe. This report documents that midlobar lung lobe torsions occur in dogs and should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of lobar vesicular emphysema and pleural effusion.","title":"Spontaneous midlobar lung lobe torsion in a 2-year-old Newfoundland.","pubmedId":"15131103"}
