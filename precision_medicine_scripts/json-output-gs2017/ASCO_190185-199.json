The treatment and outcomes of young adults with pancreatic cancer has not been well studied. The aim of this study is to describe the treatment, outcomes, and impact of race in young adults with pancreatic cancer. Methods: Data were obtained from all US hospitals that contributed to the National Cancer Database (NCDB) between 2004 and 2013. Univariate and multivariate testing was done to identify factors associated with patient outcome. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between patient characteristics, time intervals and survival. Results: A total of 9,657 patients between 18 and 50 years of age were identified. The mean age was 45.4 years (SD4.6), with a male preponderance (58.3%). Distribution across stages I-IV was 6.1%, 31.1%, 13.9% and 48.8% consecutively, and was similar across all racial groups. About 30.9% of patients underwent resection of the primary pancreatic tumor. Univariate analysis showed survival difference between ages 18-34 vs. 35-50 years old (HR 0.81; 0.71-0.92; p\u003c0.001). On multivariable analysis, Hispanics had significantly higher survival rates than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) (HR 0.7; 0.64-0.76; p\u003c0.001). Compared to Blacks, Hispanics were more likely to benefit from surgical resection (HR 0.76; 0.61-0.94; p\u003d0.011) and chemotherapy administration (HR 0.78; 0.69-0.88; p\u003c0.001). Overall, patients treated between 2009 and 2013 had higher survival rates compared to 2004-2008 (HR 0.86; 0.82-0.91; p\u003c0.001). The improvement in 5-year overall survival rates over time was highest in American Indians and Asian/Pacific Islanders (16.6% vs. 6.5%); Blacks (10.6% vs. 8.5%) and Hispanics (14.5% vs. 12.6%). NHWs marginally improved from 8.4% to 9.8%. Conclusions: Survival in pancreatic cancer patients younger than 50 years has improved over time, with major gains in minority populations.
