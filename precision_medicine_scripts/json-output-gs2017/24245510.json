Previous studies have not investigated the expression of hypoxia-related markers in IMTs.\nBetween 2002 and 2012, 12 consecutive patients with histologically proven IMTs were enrolled in the study. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect GLUT-1, HIF-1α, PI3K, and p-Akt expression in paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. Associations among GLUT-1, HIF-1α, PI3K, and p-Akt protein expression and clinical parameters were investigated.\nThe mean duration of follow-up was 52.1 months (range, 11 to 132 months). Six patients had local recurrence. GLUT-1, HIF-1α, PI3K, and p-Akt expression were detected in 41.7%, 50.0%, 33.3%, and 41.7% of patients, respectively. Fisher\u0027s exact test revealed significant correlations between recurrence of IMT and PI3K expression (P \u003d 0.01) and p-Akt expression (P \u003d 0.015). Univariate analyses revealed significant correlations between survival and GLUT-1 expression (P \u003d 0.028), PI3K expression (P \u003d 0.006), and p-Akt expression (P \u003d 0.028). Multivariate analysis did not show a significant relationship between survival and GLUT-1, HIF-1α, PI3K, or p-Akt. Spearman rank correlation analysis showed significant correlations between HIF-1α and PI3K expression (r \u003d 0.707, P \u003d 0.01) and between p-Akt and PI3K expression (r \u003d 0.837, P \u003d 0.001).\nAlthough our results are inconclusive owing to the small sample size, they suggest that PI3K and p-Akt expression may play a role in the recurrence of IMTs of the head and neck.","title":"Expression of hypoxia-related markers in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"24245510"}
