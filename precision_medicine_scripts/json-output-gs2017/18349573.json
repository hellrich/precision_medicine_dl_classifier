Gemcitabine is a key agent for the first-line therapy of advanced pancreatic cancer. It can enhance the quality of life and prolong the survival of patients. Combination of erlotinib or capecitabine with gemcitabine showed a marginal survival benefit over single-agent gemcitabine. If patient\u0027s performance state is good, gemcitabine-based platinum combination therapy showed overall survival benefit compared with gemcitabine monothrapy. If the first-line palliative chemotherapy fails, 5-FU, capcitabine, or tegafur with or without combination can be used as the second-line agents. Adjuvant chemotherapy using 5-FU or gemcitabine after curative resection has overall survival benefit. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been proven to be effective in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","title":"[Chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer].","pubmedId":"18349573"}
