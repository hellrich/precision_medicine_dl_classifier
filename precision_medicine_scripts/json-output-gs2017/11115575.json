In order to save patients with pancreatic cancer, it is necessary to develop novel methods for treatment. For such a purpose, a series of well-characterized cancer cell lines are of great help for in vitro studies that are generally the first step in approaching the invention of novel methods for treatment. In the present study, we analyzed 15 human pancreatic cancer cell lines for genetic alterations of the K-ras, p53, p16, and SMAD4 genes, which are very frequent targets for mutation in pancreatic cancer; these cell lines are useful resources in cancer research.","title":"Characterization of the mutations of the K-ras, p53, p16, and SMAD4 genes in 15 human pancreatic cancer cell lines.","pubmedId":"11115575"}
