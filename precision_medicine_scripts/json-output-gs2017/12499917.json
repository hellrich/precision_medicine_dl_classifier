RCAS1 was found in the cytoplasm of cancer cells and ductal cells. Serum RCAS1 concentrations in patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were significantly higher than those in patients with chronic pancreatitis (p \u003c 0.0001), acute pancreatitis (p \u003c 0.005), and autoimmune pancreatitis (p \u003c 0.001). RCAS1 concentrations in patients with intraductal papillary-mucinous adenoma of the pancreas were also significantly higher than those in patients with chronic pancreatitis (p \u003c 0.05) and autoimmune pancreatitis (p \u003c 0.05). Positive serum RCAS1 samples (concentration, \u003e or \u003d 10 U/mL) were found most often in cases of pancreatic neoplasm (80% [16/20], ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas; and 60% [3/5], intraductal papillary-mucinous adenoma of the pancreas). By contrast, in cases of pancreatic inflammatory diseases, raised concentrations occurred in 9.4% (3/32) of chronic pancreatitis cases, none (0/6) of acute pancreatitis cases, and none (0/8) of autoimmune pancreatitis cases. The sensitivity of CA19-9 for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was 75% and the specificity was 73.1% compared with chronic pancreatitis. On the other hand, the sensitivity of RCAS1 for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was 80% and the specificity was 96.2% compared with chronic pancreatitis. The specificity of RCAS1 for chronic pancreatitis was higher than that of CA19-9. Serum soluble Fas ligand concentrations were not considerably different among these patients.\nRCAS1 was highly expressed in ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and serum RCAS1 concentrations in patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were significantly higher than those in patients with other inflammatory pancreatic diseases. Our results indicate that serum RCAS1 concentrations could be a new marker in screening procedures for pancreatic cancer.","title":"Expression and diagnostic evaluation of the human tumor-associated antigen RCAS1 in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"12499917"}
