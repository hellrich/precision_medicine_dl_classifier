Cholangiocarcinoma has been reported in pts with germline mutations in BAP1, BRCA1/2, and mismatch repair genes. These associations are poorly characterized to date and the majority of pts do not undergo clinical germline analysis (CGA). Methods: Pts with BTC were offered consent to CGA between 01/2016 and 01/2017 under an IRB approved protocol (NCT01775072). Using the MSK-IMPACT platform, 76 genes associated with hereditary cancer predisposition were analyzed for germline variants and matched tumor samples were analysed for somatic alterations in \u003e 340 genes. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Results: 78 patients were accrued: Intrahepatic \u003d 52, extrahepatic \u003d 13, gallbladder \u003d 13. Median age at diagnosis was 57 years (range 21-80), 45 (58%) had a positive family history of cancer in at least one 1st degree or two 2nd degree relatives. 7 patients had a personal history of cancer. A pathogenic or likely pathogenic GA was identified in 16 pts (20%). (See table). Conclusions: Prospective analysis of GAs in pts with BTC, unselected by family history or age, revealed potentially actionable findings in 20% of pts. CGA in pts with BTC may benefit patients and their families in view of screening and therapeutic implications.
