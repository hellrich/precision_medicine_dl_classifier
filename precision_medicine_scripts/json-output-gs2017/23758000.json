We present here 7 cases of malignant vascular neoplasms of the breast, including 2 cases of postmastectomy Stewart-Treves syndrome. In this case series, most of the patients were young. Tumour was bilateral at presentation in one case. The size of the tumours ranged from 1.6 cm to 11 cm. Although breast angiosarcomas are rare neoplasms, with the increasing use of radiation therapy for breast cancer patients, post-radiation skin lesions should not be ignored.","title":"Malignant vascular tumours associatedwith the breast: a study of 7 cases.","pubmedId":"23758000"}
