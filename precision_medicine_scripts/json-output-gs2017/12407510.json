More experimental treatments, such as vaccine approaches, antibody treatments, and gene therapy are being developed and are of high scientific interest; however, their efficacy in advanced melanoma patients has so far been very limited. Based on the observation of a small proportion of long-term responses, the use of biotherapy or biochemotherapy is currently preferred in many institutions as first-line treatment in stage IV melanoma. Various interleukin-2 (IL-2) dosing schedules and combinations with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) have been tested in patients with advanced melanoma during the past decade. The response rates reported with IL-2 as a single agent or in combination with IFN-alpha varies from 10% to 41%, with a small, but remarkable proportion of durable responses. Subsequently, biochemotherapy regimens combining IL-2, IFN-alpha, and chemotherapy have been evaluated in phase II trials, which have suggested improved response rates. Recent randomized trials have investigated the role of biochemotherapy as compared to biotherapy alone or as compared to chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma. So far, none of the approaches has been proven to confer a survival benefit and thus the uniform desire is to include as many patients as possible in controlled clinical trials.","title":"Biochemotherapy for advanced melanoma.","pubmedId":"12407510"}
