Predictors of hepatobiliary malignancy and patient survival rates have been analysed.\nHepatobiliary malignancy was found in 52/255 (20%) patients accepted to the waiting list. Recent diagnosis of PSC, no ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment, clinical suspicion and previous colorectal-cancer were predictors of malignancy. Among 89 patients with a strong suspicion of malignancy prior to acceptance, 35 (39%) had confirmed malignancy. A clinical suspicion had been raised in 35/52 (67%) patients with malignancy. Malignancy was found in 31/223 patients who received a liver allograft. The 1-, 3- and 5-year patient survival rates following transplantation for patients with PSC and cholangiocarcinoma were 65, 35 and 35%, respectively.\nHepatobiliary malignancy is suspected in 1/3 of the PSC patients and found in 1/5. Although cholangiocarcinoma is regarded as a contraindication to liver transplantation (LTX), PSC patients with cholangiocarcinoma had a 35% 5-year survival following transplantation.","title":"Liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis; predictors and consequences of hepatobiliary malignancy.","pubmedId":"15094230"}
