LOH of chromosome 10 was detected by PCR based microsatellite polymorphism analysis technique using 20 pairs of microsatellite primers in 16 samples of prostate carcinoma and 14 samples of high grade PIN.\nThere were different frequencies of LOH in different loci on chromosome 10, varying from 0 to 46.2%, mainly located at 10q23 and 10q24-q25 regions. Seven samples of high grade PIN had LOH detected on chromosome 10.\nThere were high frequency of LOH regions on chromosome 10 of prostate carcinoma. The rate of LOH in high grade PIN was much lower than that in prostate carcinoma. PTEN and MXI1 were two candidate tumor suppressor genes on 10q23 and 10q24-q25. They may be potentially involved in the initiation and progression of prostate carcinoma.","title":"[Analysis of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 10 in human prostate carcinoma and high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia].","pubmedId":"15476185"}
