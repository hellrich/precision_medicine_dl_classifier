The patient presented symptoms of diabetes with extreme hyperglycemia \u003e1600 mg/dl and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma. Laboratory tests showed metabolic/respiratory acidosis, methanol 80 mg/dl, ethanol 0.47 g/l, creatinine 3.5 mg/dl, urea 140 mg/dl, lactic acid 4.11 mmol/l, myoglobin \u003e1000 ng/ml, HbA1C \u003e14.5%. During a few days prior to the hospitalization the patient was drinking a great amount of fruit juices and milk (a dozen or so litres per twenty four hours). The eventuality of metabolizing glucose and aspartame into methanol is known from professional literature. The possibility of excessive consumption of aspartame and its metabolites causing methanol poisoning in the presented patient was considered.","title":"[Methanol poisoning in a 61-year old male with recently diagnosed diabetes--a case report].","pubmedId":"22010455"}
