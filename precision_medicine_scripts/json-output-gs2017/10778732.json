Although the definitive threshold to cause myelitis is unknown, it is believed that less than 50 Gy when given in 25 or more fractions is highly unlikely to cause myelopathy. This report describes a case of myelitis within the radiotherapy portal in an HIV infected patient who received radiation therapy for an atypical meningioma located in the cervical spine. A complete resolution of the meningioma was also noted in this case. The possible contributing roles of HIV infection and concomitant administration of antiviral drugs are discussed.","title":"Post-radiotherapy myelitis observed in an AIDS patient with a meningioma: case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"10778732"}
