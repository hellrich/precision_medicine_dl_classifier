Immunohistochemistry showed 46.8% (148/316) tumors positive for FGFR4 and 7.3% (23/316) for adjacent normal specimens. FGFR4 positivity was correlated with shortened disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis revealed that FGFR4 was an independent prognostic factor. FGFR4 silencing markedly reduced the migration and invasion capacity of colorectal cancer cell lines. These results suggest FGFR4 is a potential prognostic and therapeutic marker for colorectal cancer.","title":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 as a potential prognostic and therapeutic marker in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"24410190"}
