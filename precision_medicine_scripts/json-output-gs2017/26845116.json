Because these aberrant transcripts are both infrequent (incidence \u003c5%) and mutually exclusive, multiplex assays are required to detect them in tumor samples.\nAberrant transcripts of the six aforementioned oncogenes (36 transcripts in total) were examined in a molecular counting (MC) assay, which counts RNA molecules by simultaneous hybridization of several probes. Forty-one samples of surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma tissue found to express one of these aberrant oncogenic transcripts upon whole transcriptome sequencing (test cohort: n \u003d 22) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (validation cohort: n \u003d 19) analyses were subjected to MC, after which biopsies were performed on tumor tissue samples.\nThreshold values for the diagnosis of each of the 36 transcripts were determined in frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from the test cohort. On the basis of these threshold values, the MC assay diagnosed expression of oncogenic transcripts in the validation cohort samples with 100% accuracy. The assay also accurately detected oncogenic fusions in bronchial lavage fluid and transbronchial biopsy samples.\nThe MC assay allows multiplex detection of oncogenic fusion and exon-skipped transcripts in tumor samples, including in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples obtained in the clinic.","title":"Multiplex Diagnosis of Oncogenic Fusion and MET Exon Skipping by Molecular Counting Using Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded Lung Adenocarcinoma Tissues.","pubmedId":"26845116"}
