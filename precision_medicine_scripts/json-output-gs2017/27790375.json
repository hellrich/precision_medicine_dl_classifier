To date, more than 200 mutations in FGFR1 have been described; however, only 10 HS-associated mutations have been reported thus far. We describe a case of typical HS with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) harboring a novel heterozygous mutation, p.His253Pro, in the extracellular domain of FGFR1. This is the first report of an HS-associated heterozygous mutation located in the extracellular domain of FGFR1, thus expanding our understanding of the phenotypic features and further developmental course associated with FGFR1 mutations.","title":"Novel heterozygous mutation in the extracellular domain of FGFR1 associated with Hartsfield syndrome.","pubmedId":"27790375"}
