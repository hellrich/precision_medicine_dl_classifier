After screening the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), the patients were divided into two groups: OSAHS (control group, n \u003d 698) and OSAHS+depression (n \u003d 629). The correlation was explored between the depression symptoms in patients with OSAHS and the sociodemographic variables and health status including smoking, drinking, marital status, apnea hyponea index (AHI), anoxicity, Family Burden Scale of Disease (FBS), Family APGAR Index (APGAR), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) and so on. Furthermore, In-depth analyses were carried out between the depression symptoms in patients with OSAHS and the social and family factor items (FBS, APGAR and PSSS).\nThe comorbidity rate of depression symptoms in patients with OSAHS in Henan province was 47.4%, and was correlated with the gender, marital status, FBS, APGAR, AHI, PSSS and anoxicity. Logistic regression analysis indicated that single marital status, APGAR, AHI, PSSS, hypoxemia and heart disease were all independent risk factors for depression in OSAHS patients. The total of the FBS score and three of its subfactors scores (family daily activities, family relationships and mental health of family members) were higher, and the total of the APGAR score and two of its subfactors scores (adaptabilith and affection) were lower in OSAHS with depression compared with the control group (P \u003c 0.05). Besides, the total score for the PSSS AND Scores for its two subfactors (family support and social support) were all lower in OSAHS patients with depression than those of the control group (P \u003c 0.05).\nIn patients with OSAHS, depression symptoms are common and are associated with marital status, AHI, anoxicity, concomitant diseases (hypertension, heart disease), concerns and supports from the family and society.","title":"[Research on risk factors of depression symptoms in 1 327 patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome].","pubmedId":"25916530"}
