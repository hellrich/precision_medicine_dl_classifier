We analyzed 1455 patients with corpus uteri and cervix uteri cancer and ovarian cancer treated in the Clinical Hospital Osijek in the period 1985-2002 (group I). Patients from Osjecko-Baranjska County were analyzed separately--1273 women, (group II) and in the group III there were 182 patients from other counties. The analyzed period was divided into: pre-war 1985-1990, war 1991-1993 and post-war period 1997-2002. In all three groups the number of patients treated for gynecological cancer was significantly larger in the post-war period (group I, N \u003d 611, group II, N \u003d 498, group III, N \u003d 113) than in the pre-war period (group I, N \u003d 457, group II, N \u003d 433, group III, N \u003d 24). The analysis of cancer frequency in relation to the site shows that a total number of patients treated for cervical cancer was larger in the post-war (N \u003d 229) than in the pre-war period (N \u003d 214), but the difference wasn\u0027t significant. However, the number of patients from Osjecko-baranjska County treated for cervical cancer was larger in the pre-war (N \u003d 207) than in the post-war period (N \u003d 178) but still, the difference wasn\u0027t significant. The number of patients treated for corpus uteri cancer and ovarian cancer was significantly larger for the I group in the post-war (N \u003d 225 and N \u003d 157 respectively) than in the pre-war period (N \u003d 136, and N \u003d 107 respectively). In the group II the number of patients treated for corpus uteri cancer and ovarian cancer was larger in the post-war (N \u003d 196 and N \u003d 124 respectively) than in the pre-war period (N \u003d 130 and N \u003d 96 respectively) but the difference was significant only for corpus uteri cancer. Significantly more women were treated for gynecological cancer in the post-war than in the pre-war period. However, the war had probably an indirect influence on the increased number of patients treated for gynecological cancer mainly because many more women arrived from other counties.","title":"Influence of the war in Croatia on the frequency of gynecological cancer in the University Hospital Osijek in the period from 1985 to 2002.","pubmedId":"16417163"}
