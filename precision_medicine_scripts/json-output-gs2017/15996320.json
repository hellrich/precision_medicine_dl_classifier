Cervical cytology was also evaluated in 454 of them by ThinPrep Pap smear.\nAmong 2636 women, 699 (26.5%) were found to be high-risk HPV positive. The highest infection rate (59.4%) was found in the age group of \u003c or \u003d 20 years and the lowest infection rate in the age group of 41 approximately 50 years (21.0%). Significant differences in HPV infection rate were found between different cities in Guangdong province, such as those between Xinhui and Guangzhou, Xinhui and Shenzhen, Xinhui and Dongguan (P \u003c 0.01). Fifteen out of 16 women (93.8%) with cervical carcinoma were infected with high-risk HPV versus 24 out of 125 women (19.2%) attending routine cervical cancer screening (P \u003c 0.001). The HPV infection rate was 30.8% (142 out of 461) in women with cervical erosion, which was significantly lower than that in patients with cervical carcinoma (P \u003c 0.001). HPV DNA were detected in 100% (2/2) of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 100% (12/12) high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), 88.9% (16/18) of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and 37.8% (28/74) of atypical squamous cells (ASC).\nHigh-risk HPV genotypes are the major causes of cervical cancers and HPV detection is a reliable adjuvant tool for cervical cancer screening.","title":"[A comparison of human papillomavirus detection and ThinPrep cytology test for women in Guangdong province].","pubmedId":"15996320"}
