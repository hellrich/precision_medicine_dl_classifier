Some patient has urinary system abnormality. No standardized surgical treatment guideline was available and the performance is varying for each patient.\nWe performed a robotic assisted reconstruction of cervix and vagina by SIS graft (Cook Medical, USA) and fusion of hemi-uterus for a 12-year-old girl from China diagnosed with congenital vaginal and cervical atresia (U4C4V4). She complained of severe periodic pain of abdomen for 2 months. Mammary development and serum sex hormone were within normal range. The patient has single kidney. The diagnosis was made according to clinical characteristics, physical examination, MRI and classified by ESHRE/ESGE system. There was a hematometra of 7cm diameter in her pelvic. We constructed a novel vagina by sharp and blunt separation and made it connected to the uterine cavity. With SIS graft we reconstructed her cervix and vagina. And we fused the hemi-uterus to make the uterine cavity spacious. The operation time was 260 min, blood loss was 300 ml. She recovered well after operation without any complication. After surgery the patient has normal menstruation without pain. She insists to wear vaginal mould 24 hours per day. The follow up was 10 months. The average length of the vagina was 9cm, average width was 3 cm.\nRobotic assisted reconstruction of cervix and vagina by SIS graft and fusion of hemi-uterus is feasible and safety. However, more cases should enroll and additional studies are required.","title":"Robotic assisted reconstruction of cervix and vagina by SIS graft and fusion of hemi-uterus.","pubmedId":"27702705"}
