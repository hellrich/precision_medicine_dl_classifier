While overexpression of c-met is documented in many types of tumors, the mechanism of c-met regulation remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate Daxx as a repressor of c-met transcription. The expression of c-met is elevated in Daxx knockout mouse cells and is reversed by Daxx reconstitution. C-met promoter analysis of Daxx-/- cells reveled changes in chromatin acetylation, but not in DNA methylation. Daxx binds to the mouse c-met promoter and Daxx-binding region is sufficient for transcription repression, while HDAC2 is associated with c-met promoter mostly in Daxx+/+ cells, pointing to Daxx-dependent HDAC2 recruitment as a potential mechanism of c-met repression. HGF-induced cell mobility and invasion confirmed augmented activity of c-Met/HGF pathway in Daxx-/- cells. Finally, inverse correlation between Daxx and c-Met in cancer cell lines and in metastatic breast cancer specimens suggests potential function of Daxx as a c-met repressor during cancer progression.","title":"Regulation of c-met expression by transcription repressor Daxx.","pubmedId":"17952115"}
