This study was to examine the correlation of polymorphisms of UGT1A7 gene to genetic susceptibility of lung cancer.\nPolymorphisms of UGT1A7 gene at 12-131 and 208 sites in peripheral lymph cells of 312 patients and 317 age- and sex-matched controls were detected by polymerase chain reaction-denaturized high performance liquid chromatography (PCR-DHPLC) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP); the correlation of these polymorphisms to genetic susceptibility of lung cancer was analyzed.\nCompared with the UGT1A7*1/*1 genotype carriers, the UGT1A7*3/*1 genotype carriers had a 1.80-fold increased risk of lung adenocarcinoma [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.80; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-3.12], the UGT1A7*3 genotype carriers had a 1.59-fold increased risk of lung adenocarcinoma (adjusted OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.96-2.63). The UGT1A7 polymorphisms had no correlation with risk of lung squamous cell carcinoma.\nUGT1A7 gene polymorphisms may increase the genetic susceptibility of lung adenocarcinoma in Chinese.","title":"[Correlation of polymorphisms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A7 gene to genetic susceptibility of lung cancer].","pubmedId":"16159430"}
