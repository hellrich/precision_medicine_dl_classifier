PJS is preconditioned by the manifestation of mutations in the STK11 gene. The majority of detected STK11 changes are small scale mutations, however recent studies showed the significant contribution of medium-sized changes commonly known as copy number variations (CNVs). Here we present a novel 7001 bps deletion of STK11 gene fragment, in which we identified the presence of breakpoints (BPs) within the Alu elements. Comparative meta-analysis with the 80 other CNV cases from 12 publications describing STK11 mutations in patients with PJS revealed the participation of specific Alu elements in all deletions of exons 2-3 so far described. Moreover, we have shown their involvement in the two other CNVs, deletion of exon 2 and deletion of exon 1-3 respectively. Deletion of exons 2-3 of the STK11 gene may prove to be the most recurrent large rearrangement causing PJS. In addition, the sequences present in its BPs may be involved in a formation of a significant percentage of the remaining gene CNVs. This gives a new insight into the conditioning of this rare disease and enables improvements in PJS genetic diagnostics.
