Esophageal and extraesophageal syndromes were assessed based on Montreal Consensus. Esophageal acid exposure and gastric pouch acidity were also evaluated.\nOverall prevalence of GERD was 64% before GBP and 33% after GBP (P \u003c 0.0001). Typical reflux syndrome (TRS) was present in 47 patients (55%) preoperatively and disappeared in 39 of them (79%) post-GBP. Out of 39 patients with no symptoms, 4 (10%) developed TRS postoperatively (P \u003c 0.0001). The chief TRS complaint changed from heartburn pre-GBP (96%) to regurgitation post-GBP (64%). Esophageal mucosa improved in 27, was unchanged in 51, and worsened in 8 patients (P \u003d 0.001) in regard of esophagitis. Extraesophageal syndromes were present in 16 patients preoperatively and in none but one post-GBP (P \u003d 0.0003). GERD-related well being and use of proton pump inhibitors were both improved after GBP. Total acid exposure decreased from a median (interquartile range, 25%-75%) of 5.1% (range, 2-8.2) to 1.1% (range, 0.2-4.8), P \u003d 0.0002. Most patients (86%) showed and acid gastric pouch in fasting conditions post-GBP.\nGBP ameliorated GERD syndromes in most patients 6 months after the procedure, resulting in quality of life improvement and less proton pump inhibitors usage. Whether regurgitation post-GBP corresponds to reflux disease or bad eating behavior deserves further studies.","title":"The impact of gastric bypass on gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with morbid obesity: a prospective study based on the Montreal Consensus.","pubmedId":"20010088"}
