We present two cases of SCLC harboring EGFR mutations, one in an 82 year-old male smoker with a combined SCLC and adenocarcinoma with a novel D855H point mutation in exon 21, and the second in a 68 year-old female never smoker with the L858R point mutation in exon 21. The cases, accompanied by a review of the literature, highlight the importance of integration of clinicopathologic considerations and adherence to recently promulgated Guideline recommendations for molecular testing in lung cancer.
