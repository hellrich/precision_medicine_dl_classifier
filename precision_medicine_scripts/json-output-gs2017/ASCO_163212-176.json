However, the HER2 status in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been fully investigated to date. CancerPlex is a comprehensive next-generation sequencing-based test that evaluates 400-plus genes for mutations and copy number changes, including HER2. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the association between HER2 status and HER2 gene alteration detected with CancerPlex in CRC. Methods: This retrospective study included 100 patients with Stage I-IV CRC, who were evaluated HER2 status and HER2 gene alteration. IHC for HER2 was classified as 4 grades according to the immunoreactivity. The patients with IHC2+ were further tested with FISH. IHC3+/IHC2+ and FISH positive patients were defined as HER2 positive. HER2 gene alteration was tested with CancerPlex, and the associations between HER2 status and HER2 gene alteration were analyzed using Fishers exact test. Results: HER2 positive cases were observed in 8% patients (IHC3+ in 6% and IHC2+ and FISH positive in 2% patients). CancerPlex results demonstrated that 6% had HER2 amplification, 15% had HER2 mutations, and 1% had both HER2 amplification and mutation. Additionally, CancerPlex detected the other mutations of MAPK pathway (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, and BRAF). The Fishers exact test revealed a significant association between HER2 status and HER2 amplification detected with CancerPlex (P\u003c 0.001), however, there was no significant association between HER2 status and HER2 mutation. Conclusions: We found 8 of 100 (8%) Japanese CRC cases are HER2 positive. There is a significant association between HER2 status and HER2 amplification detected with CancerPlex. CancerPlex is a comprehensive testing tool for detecting gene alterations including not only mutations of MAPK pathway (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, and BRAF), but also HER2 amplification, which is a possible useful predictor of the candidates for HER2 targeted therapies in CRC.","title":"Large panel genomic profiling using CancerPlex to reveal candidates for HER2 targeted therapies in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_163212-176"}
