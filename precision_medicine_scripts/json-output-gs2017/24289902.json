Recent studies using radiotherapy with survival data, resection rates and quality of life data have been analyzed.\nThere are no randomized trials regarding the treatment of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The bulk of available studies suggest that in some cases radio-chemotherapy can be used as adjuvant therapy. Radiotherapy could also have a role in unresectable cholangiocarcinoma: external radiotherapy or intraluminal brachytherapy--alone or in combination--could improve the outcome in selected patients. Finally, radiotherapy, and in particular intraluminal brachytherapy, could be used as a palliative treatment to improve the quality of life and in controlling symptoms.\nThe role of radiotherapy in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma remains undefined due to the lack of randomized trials or otherwise properly controlled studies.","title":"Chemoradiation and brachytherapy in extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24289902"}
