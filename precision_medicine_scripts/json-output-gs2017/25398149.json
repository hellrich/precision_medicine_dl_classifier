We also observed the associations between mutations and histopathological characteristics of tumor.\nOverall, mutations were present in 25.3% (24/95) of PIK3CA gene, of this 14.7% (14/95) of mutations were located in exon 9 and 10.5% (10/95) of mutations were in exon 20. We detected three \"hotspot\" mutations, two were located in exon 9 (E542K, E545K) and the third mutation was found in exon 20 (H1047R). Mutations in exon 9 showed significant correlation with lower grade(p \u003d 0.0074) and pN status without metastases(p \u003d 0.0415). Mutations in exon 20 were associated with higher age of patient (p \u003d 0.0249). The E545K mutation correlated with lower grade (p \u003d 0.0013) and pN status (p \u003d 0.0232) particularly; the H1047R mutation was significantly more frequent in lobular type of breast cancer (p \u003d 0.0354).\nThe PI3K signaling pathway plays a critical oncogenic role in the development of human breast cancer and the prevalence of its deregulation advocates its potential as a feasible therapeutic target. In our study we demonstrate a significant correlation between the presence of PIK3CA mutations and some clinicopathological characteristics of tumour. We have shown that the mutations in exon 9 of PIK3CA were associated with favourable prognostic factors.\n\"hotspot\" mutation, PIK3CA, PI3K pathway, breast cancer.","title":"[Correlation between the incidence of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer and histopathological characteristics of the tumor].","pubmedId":"25398149"}
