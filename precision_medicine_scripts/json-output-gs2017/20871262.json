This phase II trial assessed the efficacy of the combination of gefitinib and everolimus in patients with advanced NSCLC.\nTwo cohorts of 31 patients with measurable stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were enrolled: (1) no prior chemotherapy and (2) previously treated with cisplatin or carboplatin and docetaxel or pemetrexed. All patients received daily everolimus 5 mg and gefitinib 250 mg. Response was assessed after 1 month and then every 2 months. Pretreatment tumor specimens were collected for mutation testing.\nSixty-two patients were enrolled (median age: 66 years, 50% women, 98% stage IV, all current/former smokers, and 85% adenocarcinoma). Partial responses were seen in 8 of 62 patients (response rate: 13%; 95% confidence interval: 5-21%); five responders had received no prior chemotherapy. Three partial responders had an EGFR mutation. Both patients with a KRAS (G12F) mutation responded. The median time to progression was 4 months. Median overall survival was 12 months, 27 months for no prior chemotherapy patients, and 11 months for patients previously treated with chemotherapy.\nThe 13% partial response rate observed did not meet the prespecified response threshold to pursue further study of the combination of gefitinib and everolimus. The response rate in patients with non-EGFR mutant tumors was 8%, likely reflecting activity of everolimus. Further investigation of mammalian target-of-rapamycin inhibitors in patients with NSCLC with KRAS G12F-mutated tumors is warranted.","title":"Phase II trial of gefitinib and everolimus in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"20871262"}
