{"genes":["anaplastic lymphoma kinase","ALK","ALK"],"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"To detect the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene in non-small cell lung cancer, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are the standard methods. However, there are discrepancies between them. We herein report a 40-year-old woman with ALK fusion-positive adenocarcinoma that changed from positive to negative in IHC due to chemo-radiotherapy. Recurrence of the disease restored the IHC expression, whereas FISH was positive throughout the entire clinical course. Our experience suggests that we should therefore carefully evaluate samples after chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
