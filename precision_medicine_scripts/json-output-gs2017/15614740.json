Dedifferentiated liposarcoma has rarely been reported in the head and neck region and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the cheek. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma is a mixed histologic subtype defined by the association of an atypical lipomatous tumor or well-differentiated liposarcoma and a nonlipogenic sarcoma. The patient was a 61-year-old man who presented with a soft-tissue mass of the left cheek and a presumptive diagnosis of salivary neoplasm based on a fine needle aspiration. The tumor was excised and consisted histologically of an atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma composed a well-differentiated lipomatous neoplasm with atypical cells and rare lipoblasts. The tumor recurred in the same location 5 months after surgery. The recurrent tumor was primarily composed of a nonlipogenic spindle sarcoma with focal rhabdomyoblastic differentiation associated with areas of an atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma.","title":"Dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the cheek.","pubmedId":"15614740"}
