SOX2 amplification has been reported in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, upon activation, promotes cell proliferation, survival and apoptotic resistance through PLC/PKC, RAS/MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, respectively. FGFR1 is also amplified in 15-25% of lung SCC and pre-clinical data with targeted inhibitors showed a growth dependency on FGFR1 amplification either in vitro and in vivo. A clinical trial with BIBF1120 (which also inhibits FGFR1), will be developed in the Netherlands and Spain in second line SCC of the lung with FGFR1 amplified by FISH. Genetic heterogeneity in solid tumors is a major research area and therefore its assessment in SCC of the lung is of great relevance.We have examined FGFR1 and SOX2 gene copy number (GCN) in 76 lung SCC by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Analysis of mutations in DDR2, PIK3CA, BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, and TP53 is ongoing.Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from enriched tumor cells by laser captured microdisection from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sections. 50-100 ng of gDNA was analyzed in each of the three independent replicates per tumor sample. Two independent probe sets were used for each gene analyzed. For inter-patient GCN value comparisons, the tumor results from each patient was normalized against the GCN values derived from FFPE peripheral blood leukocytes control. We also used MLPA technique to study intra-tumor heterogeneity (TH) by analyzing FGFR1 and SOX2 in different tumor areas. In particular, in 4 cases FGFR1 and SOX2 were co-amplified. Also, TH was examined in serial tumor biopsies and/or resections obtained at different points of disease progression in two patients.Of the 76 patients evaluable for FGFR1 and SOX2 GCN, FGFR1 high amplification was detected in 13/76 (17.10%) and low amplification in 7/76 (9.21%). SOX2 presented high amplification in 38/63 (60.32%) and low amplification in 9/63 (14.28%). Interestingly, 46.15% of the FGFR1-amplified tumors were also co-amplified for SOX2. An important degree of TH was found in 2 of the 4 tumors analyzed. GCN changes in FGFR1, SOX2, PIK3CA, PDGFRa, KDR, EGFR and MET over 10 years follow-up will be presented for one surgically resected SCC lung cancer patient. Frequencies of FGFR1 and SOX2 gene amplifications detected are in agreement with previously published data. Survival according to FGFR1 and SOX2 status will also be presented. FGFR1 and SOX2 co-amplification, together with the TH, warrants further research and could represent a novel therapeutic target.","title":"FGFR1 and SOX2 amplification in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-53"}
