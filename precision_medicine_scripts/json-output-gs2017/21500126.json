Surgical resection is currently the most effective treatment in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, and historically the only treatment approach achieving significant cure rates. In advanced disease, therapeutic approaches involving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy are utilized to improve prognosis, either as part of a neoadjuvant treatment approach followed by surgical resection or as definitive treatment alone. The role of surgery in locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer remains controversial, with more studies required to further refine the application of modern surgical techniques. For any treatment approach, thorough preoperative staging as well as careful patient selection are essential to assess the benefits and risks involved for the patient. Surgical management of early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer and its role in more advanced disease are discussed in this review.","title":"Surgical management of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21500126"}
