We report the case of a 58-year-old woman with a large aneurysmal fistula arising from the left coronary tree and involving the entire coronary sinus venous system, resulting in significant left-to-right shunt. We discuss the management of aneurysmal fistulae of the coronary arteries, and the merits of prophylaxis for thrombotic complications of large aneurysms. We recommend consideration of warfarinisation in addition to aspirin of such patients post-operatively.","title":"Complex coronary sinus fistula in a 58-year-old female.","pubmedId":"18450509"}
