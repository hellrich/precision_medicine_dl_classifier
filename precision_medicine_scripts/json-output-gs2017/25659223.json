The automated IHC assay was performed using the SP174 clone, and compared with results of the molecular testing.\nEvaluation of a test cohort with knowledge of the mutation status established a specific IHC pattern for the mutation. In the independent blinded analysis of the remaining cases, the anti-NRAS (Q61R) antibody accurately identified all NRAS Q61R-mutated tumors, and demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity.\nLimitations include retrospective design and lack of multicenter interobserver reproducibility.\nThe NRAS (Q61R) IHC assay is reliable and specific for the evaluation of the Q61R mutation status in metastatic melanoma and may be an alternative to molecular biology in evaluation of metastatic melanoma in routine practice.","title":"Immunohistochemistry as a potential tool for routine detection of the NRAS Q61R mutation in patients with metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"25659223"}
