The Food and Drug Administration approved the first human papillomavirus vaccine and has recommended routine vaccination of 11 to 12 year old girls with catch-up vaccination for females 13 to 26 years of age. This primary prevention tool for cervical cancer could significantly reduce cervical cancer, but broad vaccination coverage will be required. Health care providers are in a position to educate parents and teens about the benefits of receiving the recommended HPV vaccine. Mandating the HPV vaccine can be effective in increasing vaccine rates, reducing disease disparities, and decreasing rates of cervical cancer.","title":"Human papillomavirus health policy.","pubmedId":"20628175"}
