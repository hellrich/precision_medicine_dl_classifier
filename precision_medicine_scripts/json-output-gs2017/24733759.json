However, despite its remarkable importance in oncology, the consequences of HER2 amplification over the extracellular vesicles (EVs) content have not yet been investigated. Here, we isolated EVs secreted by HB4a, a mammary luminal epithelial cell line and C5.2, its HER2-overexpressing clone. We isolated two EV sets (20 and 100 K) by ultracentrifugation and used electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis for their morphological characterization. We employed GeLC-MS/MS combined with isotope-coded protein labeling to evaluate cell-derived proteins and LC-MS/MS label free spectral counting to quantify the EVs proteome. We found higher HER2 levels in both C5.2-derived EVs when compared with C5.2 cells, suggesting its preferential shuttling. Proteins capable of inducing malignant transformation are enriched in both C5.2 EV subsets, including two HER2-related proteins involved in cell motility and invasion, cofilin and CD44. MetaCoreâ„¢ analysis indicated an enrichment of cell adhesion and cytoskeleton-remodeling pathways in C5.2 EVs, as well as proteins related to HER2 signaling, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway. Together, our data indicate that in terms of protein content, distinct vesicle sets reinforce and complement each other. Our results also suggest that HER2-upregulated proteins from EVs may be relevant for cellular malignancy and can be potential biomarkers for HER2(+) cancer patients.
