The patient had significant recovery of visual loss following excision of the meningioma. We believe that this tumor was induced by radiation received by the patient previously and we stress that tissue diagnosis should be obtained in patients who develop a recurrent tumor after a long period following initial radiotherapy. Radiation induced meningioma has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient who has a recurrence after therapeutic radiation. This is especially essential in the absence of biochemical and clinical signs of a previously functioning pituitary adenoma and before the initiation of medical therapy for recurrent pituitary adenomas.","title":"Suprasellar meningioma subsequent to treatment for a pituitary adenoma: case report.","pubmedId":"9131026"}
