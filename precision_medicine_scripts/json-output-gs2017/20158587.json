The use of intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has increased significantly in the past decade. SLNB is performed as minimally invasive procedure that provides accurate staging of melanoma patients with no clinically detectable nodal disease. In many melanoma units across the world, it became the standard for detection of occult regional node metastasis in patients with intermediate-thickness primary melanoma. Use of SLNB in patients with thin melanomas is still under evaluation. Although SLNB has been established as staging procedure in melanoma patients, its therapeutic role is still not clear. Large-scale ongoing randomized trials should elucidate whether SLNB with complete lymphadenectomy has a survival benefit in melanoma patients with early lymph node metastases compared to \u0027watch-and-wait\u0027 policy (observation).","title":"Sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"20158587"}
