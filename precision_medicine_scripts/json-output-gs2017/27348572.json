Exon 19 deletion (45.7%) and exon 21 L858R (45.6%) accounted for the vast majority of the EGFR mutations detected, with the remaining mutations being infrequent (\u003c2%). Compound mutations were seen in 51 (3%) of the mutant cases, the combination of these compound mutations could be classified into three subgroups according to the potential impact of individual mutations on EGFR TKI therapy. Accordingly, 7 cases had both sensitive mutations, 4 cases harboured one sensitive and one less responsive /uncertain mutation, 19 cases contained one sensitive and one resistant change, and a further 21 cases had two less responsive /uncertain mutations.\nOur data represents the largest EGFR mutation survey based on routine clinical diagnostic laboratory data from a single institution, it confirms the incidence and characteristics of EGFR mutations in NSCLC seen in Asian patients, and also unravels the combinatorial nature of rare compound EGFR mutations.","title":"EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer: an audit from West China Hospital.","pubmedId":"27348572"}
