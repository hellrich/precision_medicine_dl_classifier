With the goals of inhibiting survival signaling in cancer cells, delaying the onset of resistance to standard-of-care therapies, and re-sensitizing cancer cells to prior therapies, we developed an anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibody, MM-121, that effectively blocks ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3 and induces internalization and degradation of the receptor. The activity of single-agent MM-121 was examined in xenograft models and a machine-learning algorithm was developed that accurately predicts which preclinical models of cancer will respond to MM-121 based on five protein-based biomarkers. By simulating ErbB3 inhibition using a computational model of ErbB signaling, we predicted that a bispecific molecule that docks onto HER2 and subsequently binds to ErbB3 would effectively block ErbB3-driven signaling in HER2-amplified tumors. We therefore developed a bispecific antibody comprising two human scFv antibodies linked by a modified form of human serum albumin. The resulting molecule, MM-111, forms a trimeric complex with HER2 and ErbB3, effectively inhibiting ErbB3 signaling and demonstrating antitumor activity in preclinical models that are dependent on HER2 overexpression. Both MM-121 and MM-111 are now in early stages of clinical development.","title":"Targeting ErbB3-addicted cancers across the HER2 spectrum","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-4945"}
