The frequencies of driver gene mutations were higher in adenocarcinomas, female patients and non-smokers (P\u003c0.01, P\u003d0.003, P\u003c0.01, respectively). Driver gene mutation status showed no correlation with either the age or the clinical stage (P\u003d0.281, P\u003d0.490, respectively). However, EGFR mutations tended to occur in adenocarcinoma, female, non-smokers, and patients of ≥62 years of age (P\u003c0.01, P\u003c0.01, P\u003d0.002, P\u003d0.012, respectively). The frequency of EGFR mutation was positively correlated with the tumor histology of lepidic, acinar, papillary and micropapillary predominant growth patterns. There was no relationship between EGFR mutation and the clinical stage (P\u003d0.237). The frequency of KRAS mutation was higher in solid predominant and invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas (P\u003d0.015); that of PIK3CA mutation was higher in patients of ≥62 years of age, invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma and fetal adenocarcinoma (P\u003d0.015, P\u003d0.006, respectively). ALK, ROS1 or RET mutation positive NSCLC tended to occur in nonsmokers and have solid predominant tumors and invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (P\u003d0.012, P\u003d0.017 respectively). The frequency of EML4-ALK mutation was higher in the early stage patients with solid predominant tumors and invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas (P\u003d0.025, P\u003d0.014, respectively); that of ROS1 rearrangement was higher in invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas (P\u003d0.049). NRAS, BRAF and HER2 gene mutations were infrequent and their clinical significance remained to be elucidated.\nThe relationship between mutations of well-known driver genes and clinicopathological characteristics in patients with NSCLC has diversity, the rate of mutations is higher in non-smoking female patients with adenocarcinoma.","title":"[Correlation of clinicopathologic features and driver gene mutation in non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"27033383"}
