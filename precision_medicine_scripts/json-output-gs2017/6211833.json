Combined treatment was given in 596 cases; treatment was confined to surgery in 40 cases. The study included an assessment of the end results with respect to stage, age of patient, histological pattern and type of growth of tumor and stage at which radiation therapy was given. Prognosis for cervical carcinoma appeared to depend on the stage of tumor process, age and type of growth, while no correlation was observed between histological pattern and survival, except for microcarcinoma and malignant polyp. Better results were obtained, when preoperative radiation course was given to patients with cervical carcinoma stage II (parametrial variant). The end results were worse in cases of regional metastases.","title":"[Factors affecting patient survival in cervical cancer].","pubmedId":"6211833"}
