Its histogenetic derivation remains controversial.\nWe report a new case of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the proximal urethra in a 56-year-old woman who presented with grossly hematuria. Urethral cystoscopy revealed a tumour protruding from the posterior urethral wall at the bladder neck. Treatment consisted of urethrocystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. Histologically, the neoplasm consisted of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the urethra.\nIt appears that female urethral adenocarcinoma has more than one tissue of origin.","title":"Clear cell adenocarcinoma of a female urethra: A case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"22666717"}
