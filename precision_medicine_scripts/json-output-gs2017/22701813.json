All 4 FGFRs and their ligands, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), are expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent studies have shown that FGFR2 plays important roles in cancer progression; therefore, it is of great interest as a novel target for cancers. Expression of FGFR2 regulates migration, invasion, and growth in CRC. Expression of the FGFR2 isoform FGFR2 IIIb was associated with well-differentiated histological types, and its specific ligand, FGF7, enhanced angiogenesis and adhesion to type-IV collagen via FGFR2 IIIb in CRC. FGFR2 IIIc is detected in CRC, but its roles have not been well elucidated. Interactions between FGFR2 IIIb and IIIc and FGFs may play important roles in CRC via autocrine and/or paracrine signaling. Several kinds of molecular-targeting agents against FGFR2 have been developed; however, it is not clear how a cancer treatment can most effectively inhibit FGFR2 IIIb or FGFR2 IIIc, or both isoforms. The aim of this paper is to summarize the roles of FGFR2 and its isoforms in CRC and clarify whether they are potent therapeutic targets for CRC.","title":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2: expression, roles, and potential as a novel molecular target for colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"22701813"}
