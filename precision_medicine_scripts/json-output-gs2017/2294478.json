The mean number of AgNORs per cell and the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index were shown to be linearly related (r \u003d 0.84, P less than 0.001). The mean AgNOR number was 2.99 for meningeal sarcoma, 2.29 for anaplastic meningioma, 2.08 for hemangiopericytic meningioma. 1.72 for recurrent meningioma without atypical histological findings, and 1.52 for nonrecurrent meningioma. We noted that the mean number of AgNORs reflected the cellular kinetics of a tumor and was related to histological grade and clinical behavior.","title":"Nucleolar organizer regions in meningioma.","pubmedId":"2294478"}
