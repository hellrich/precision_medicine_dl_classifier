Cetuximab demonstrates anti-cancer effect via NK cells and subsequent immunogenic cell death. Chemotherapy or targeted therapy may change immune surface markers.Methods: We characterized a panel of 6 CRC cell lines with different genetic features. The impacts of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) on cell surface expressions of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (including subtypes), MHC class II (including subtypes), MHC class 1 related molecule A (MICA, the NK cell ligand), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1, the immunoglobulin superfamily), EGFR, and Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan 4 (CSPG-4, pericyte attaching marker) before and after treatment with IFN-γ (100 U/ml, 48 h) were explored in selected cell linesResults:Among six human colon cancer cell lines analyzed, DLD-1, HCT15, and LoVoexhibited no expression of HLA-A and HLA-B,C. Colo-320 demonstrated both low HLA-A and HLA-B,C expression and irresponsive to IFN-γ stimulation. In contrast, both HT-29 and SW-480 showed low HLA-A and HLA-B,C expression, but the expression of both HLA-A and HLA-B,C was corrected after IFN-γ stimulation. All six cell lines possessed low MHC class II expression and irresponsive to IFN-γ stimulation. All six cell lines possessed low MIC expression and irresponsive to IFN-γ stimulation. All six cell lines showed low ICAM-1 expression, but only HT-29 and SW-480 were responsive to IFN-γ stimulation. LOVO and SW-480 demonstrated high EGFR expression and irresponsive to IFN-γ stimulation. Only HT-29 possessed high CSPG-4 expression.Conclusion:These findings reveal that regardless of their genetic features, all six CRC cell lines possess a phenotype that may allow them to escape cytotoxic T and NK cell attack.TableCell LineMSICIMPKRASBRAFPI3KCATP53DLD-1MSI+G13DWTE545KS241FHCT-15MSI+G13DWTE545KS241FLOVOMSI-G13DWTWTWTCOLO-320MSS-WTWTWTR248WHT-29MSS+WTV600EP449TR273HSW-480MSS-G12VWTWTR273H","title":"HLA and NKG2D ligand abnormalities and IFN-γ unnresponsiveness in human colorectal carcinoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-4639"}
