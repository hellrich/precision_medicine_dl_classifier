This suggests the important role of constitutional predisposition. In Japanese cases with silicosis, the frequency of HLA-B54 was increased and disease susceptibility gene (s) may exist near the HLA-B locus. It is well known that silicosis is frequently accompanied with rheumatoid arthritis, probably due to the effects of silica on the immunological system. We encountered a case of silicosis with rheumatoid arthritis and lung cancer, who was found to have HLA-B54.","title":"[A case of HLA-B54 positive silicosis with rheumatoid arthritis and lung cancer].","pubmedId":"17233401"}
