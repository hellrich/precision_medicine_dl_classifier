We aimed to examine whether EUS-FNA can be used to diagnose such lesions.\nThis study included a subset of 10 consecutive patients in whom EUS-FNA targeted the ampulla of Vater. All the patients underwent biopsy and/or brushing cytology under endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) prior to EUS-FNA. The final diagnosis was based on pathological examinations of specimens obtained by surgical resection or clinical follow-up more than 1 year in case of evidence of benign lesions.\nTissues from the ampulla of Vater could be obtained by EUS-FNA for all 10 patients. The final diagnosis was papillitis (n \u003d 7) and intra-ampullary carcinoma (n \u003d 3). Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater showed neither exposure on the duodenal mucosal surface nor invasion to the pancreas. The diagnostic accuracy of surface biopsy with duodenoscopy, and intra-ampullary biopsy and/or brush cytology with ERCP and/or intra-ampullary biopsy after endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) in distinguishing between benign and malignancy was 70%. The diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA was 100%. No complications associated with EUS-FNA were encountered in this study.\nEUS-FNA for ampulla of Vater may be safely and accurately performed, and should be considered as a diagnostic modality before EST.","title":"Can endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration offer clinical benefit for tumors of the ampulla of vater? -an initial study.","pubmedId":"24949343"}
