We report our experience with a combination of nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine followed by concurrent Capecitabine and radiation therapy in BR pancreatic cancer patients. . Methods: A prospectively maintained database of patients with BR pancreatic cancer undergoing neo-adjuvant treatments at our center between 01/2013- 6/2015 was reviewed. Pts were treated with Gemcitabine(1gm/m2) and nab-paclitaxel (125mg/m2) given on D1/8/15 every 28 days . Pts. were re-assessed after 2 cycles and the responding pts received 2 additional cycles. Pts. continuing to respond after 4 cycles were treated with capecitabine (825mg/m2) and radiation treatments (50.4Gy). Results: A total of 15 patients with PS 0/1 were treated. Median age was 57 yrs (46-71) and M/F ratio was 12:3. After 2 cycles of Gem/nab-paclitaxel, none of the pts. had progressive disease. All patients completed 4 cycles of Gem/nab-paclitaxel. All 15 patients (100%) received capecitabine and radiation treatments. Responses with the neo-adjuvant treatments were; 0 CR, 4 PR, 10 SD, 1 PD. Eleven patients (73%) underwent planned resection, 3 had PD and 1 had decline in PS. Nine out of eleven (81%) patients undergoing surgery had a R0 resection. Grade-III/IV toxicities with the neo-adjuvant treatments were seen in 40% and 6 % of the pts., respectively. There was no 30 day post-op mortality, pancreatic leaks or re-operations. 12/15 (80%) patients are alive with a median follow-up of 10 months range: (4-26months). Of the 11 patients who had surgery,10 (90%) are alive, 8 (72%) have no evidence of disease and one died after 22 months. Conclusions: Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine followed by Capecitabine and radiation treatment is an effective neo-adjuvant strategy with acceptable toxicity-profile in the management of patients with good performance status diagnosed with BR pancreatic cancer.","title":"Neoadjuvant gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel followed by concurrent capecitabine and radiation efficacy in borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_166144-176"}
