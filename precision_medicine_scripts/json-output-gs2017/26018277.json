The 3 groups of patients received different treatments, and the therapeutic effects, progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment-related adverse events were analyzed.\nCrizotinib treatment obviously prolonged the PFS in EML4-ALK-positive patients with an objective response rate (OOR) of 61.9% and a median response duration of 16 months, which were significantly better than those in with ALK-negative patients and patients without ALK testing who received different second-line therapies.\nCrizotinib is superior to platinum-based chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangement. ALK rearrangement id not a modifier of the effect of chemotherapy regimens in NSCLC patients.","title":"[Therapeutic effects of crizotinib in EML4-ALK-positive patients with non-small-cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"26018277"}
