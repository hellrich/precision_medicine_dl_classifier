Gene copy number was evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization, and an FGFR1-amplified tumor (FGFR1 amp(+)) was prespecified as a tumor with nine or more copies of FGFR1.\nAmong 262 patients, the frequency of FGFR1 amp(+) was 13.0%. Patients with FGFR1 amp(+) had significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS; 26.9 v 94.6 months; P \u003c .001) as well as shorter overall survival (OS; 51.2 v 115.0 months; P \u003d .002) than those without FGFR1 amp(+). Multivariate modeling confirmed that patients with FGFR1 amp(+) had a significantly greater risk of recurrence and death than those without FGFR1 amp(+) after adjusting for sex, smoking status, pathologic stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy (DFS: adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.24; 95% CI, 1.45 to 3.45; P \u003c .001; OS: AHR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.89; P \u003d .01). The frequency of FGFR1 amp(+) was significantly higher in current smokers than in former smokers and never-smokers (28.9% v 2.5% v 0%; P(trend) \u003c .001). As the smoking dosage increased, so did the incidence of FGFR1 amp(+) (P(trend) \u003d .002).\nFGFR1 amplification is an independent negative prognostic factor in surgically resected SCCL and is associated with cigarette smoking in a dose-dependent manner. FGFR1 amplification is a relevant therapeutic target in Asian patients with SCCL.","title":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene amplification is associated with poor survival and cigarette smoking dosage in patients with resected squamous cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23182986"}
