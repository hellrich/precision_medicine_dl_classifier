Therefore, we investigated whether emphysema was a risk factor associated with the outcome after resection for lung cancer. This study enrolled 237 patients with non small cell lung cancer with stage I or II who had surgical removal. Patient outcome was analyzed based on emphysema. Emphysema was found in 43.4% of all patients. Patients with emphysema were predominantly men and smokers, and had a lower body mass index than the patients without emphysema. The patients without emphysema (n\u003d133) survived longer (mean 51.2+/-3.0 vs. 40.6+/-3.1 months, P\u003d0.042) than those with emphysema (n\u003d104). The univariate analysis showed a younger age, higher FEV(1)/FVC, higher body mass index, cancer stage I, and a lower emphysema score were significant predictors of better survival. The multivariate analysis revealed a younger age, higher body mass index, and cancer stage I were independent parameters associated with better survival, however, emphysema was not. This study suggests that unfavorable outcomes after surgical resection of lung cancer should not be attributed to emphysema itself.","title":"Emphysema as a risk factor for the outcome of surgical resection of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"20676324"}
