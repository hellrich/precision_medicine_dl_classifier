All melanoma patients who first had a sentinel node biopsy followed by a radical lymph node dissection were included.\nSeventy-four patients had radical lymph node dissection after confirmation of metastasis in a sentinel node. The sites of the lymphadenectomy were axillary in 51% of patients, groin in 43%, neck in 5% and popliteal in 1%. A nodal metastasis was observed in 12 of 74 lymph node dissections. Median follow-up time was 41.5 months (3-135 months). At least one complication was seen in 47 patients (64%). Early complications were: postoperative infection (n\u003d9; 12%), lymphocele (n\u003d22; 30%), chronic seroma (n\u003d9; 12%), postoperative haematoma (n\u003d6; 8%), and wound separation (n\u003d7; 9%). Late complications were: lymphoedema (n\u003d30; 41%), joint complications (n\u003d10; 14%), fibrous scar (n\u003d11; 15%), chronic pain (n\u003d6; 8%) and hyposensitivity (n\u003d6; 8%). Two patients were rehospitalised for a complication. The complication rate was 53% for axillary location and 81% for inguinal location (P\u003d0.02).\nRadical lymph node dissection performed after positive sentinel node biopsy in melanoma patients is associated with significant morbidity.","title":"[Complication of radical lymph node dissection following sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with melanoma].","pubmedId":"23773739"}
