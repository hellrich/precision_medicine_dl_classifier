Nine recurrences (11%) were non-invasive. Of the 82 patients four received adjuvant systemic therapy only and no surgery. Of the 78 patients treated with surgery 72 underwent mastectomy, 6 local excision. After treatment, the actuarial five-year overall survival, distant recurrence-free survival and disease-free survival rates were 60%, 43% and 31% respectively. Local control, defined as survival without second local recurrence and without local progression of the disease, was 57% after five years.\nThe five-year distant recurrence-free and disease-free survival rates for patients with local recurrence after breast conserving-therapy were low. The high proportion of second local recurrences and local progression of disease in this study underlines the difficulty of obtaining local control after treatment of local recurrence.","title":"[Local recurrence following breast-conserving treatment for breast carcinoma; treatment and prognosis in 82 patients].","pubmedId":"8524423"}
