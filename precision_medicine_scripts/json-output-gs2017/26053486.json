Until now, its prognostic value has never been studied in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The aim of this study was to investigate podocalyxin expression in PDAC by a novel monoclonal antibody and a commercially available polyclonal antibody.\nWith tissue microarrays and immuno-histochemistry, podocalyxin expression evaluation involved 168 PDAC patients. The associations of the podocalyxin tumor expression with clinicopathological variables were explored by Fisher\u0027s exact test and the linear-by-linear test. Survival analyses were by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model.\nThe polyclonal antibody revealed membranous podocalyxin expression in 73 (44.0%) specimens and the monoclonal antibody was highly expressed in 36 (21.8%) cases. Membranous expression by the polyclonal antibody was associated with T classification (p\u003d0.045) and perineural invasion (p\u003d0.005), and high expression by the mono-clonal antibody with poor differentiation (p\u003d0.033). High podocalyxin expression associated significantly with higher risk of death from PDAC by both the polyclonal antibody (hazard ratio (HR) \u003d 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-2.33; p\u003d0.01) and the monoclonal antibody (HR \u003d 2.10, 95% CI 1.38-3.20; p\u003c0.001). The results remained significant in multivariate analysis, adjusted for age, gender, stage, lymph node ratio (â‰¥/\u003c 20%), and perivascular invasion (respectively as HR \u003d 2.03; 95% CI 1.32-3.13, p\u003d0.001; and as HR \u003d 2.36; 95% CI 1.47-3.80, p\u003c0.001).\nWe found podocalyxin to be an independent factor for poor prognosis in PDAC. To our knowledge, this is the first such report of its prognostic value.","title":"Podocalyxin Is a Marker of Poor Prognosis in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26053486"}
