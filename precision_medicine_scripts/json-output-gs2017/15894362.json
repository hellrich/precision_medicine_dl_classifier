Chromosome 17 polysomy status by FISH was also assessed in all specimens.\nModerate-to-strong expression of HER2/neu protein was noted in 16 (62%) of 26 USPC samples evaluated, with 7 (27%) samples showing moderate staining (2+) and 9 (35%) showing strong staining (3+) for HER2/neu. Amplification of the ERBB2 gene by FISH was observed in 11 of the 26 (42%) cases. Protein overexpression and gene amplification were found to correlate in 100% (9 of 9) of the 3+ positive tumors and 2 out of 7 (29%) of the 2+ positive tumors. Heterogeneity was noted in 3 cases in the amplification of the HER2/neu gene within the same tumor samples with pockets of amplified tumor cells amidst nonamplified tumor cells. None of the 10 USPC cases scored by IHC as 0 or 1+ was found positive for ERBB2 amplification by FISH.\nAmplification of the HER2/neu oncogene represents a common finding in USPC. FISH analysis should be used for confirmation of gene amplification in USPC showing 2+ expression of HER2/neu. Prior screening and selection of appropriate immunohistochemistry-positive areas may be beneficial in the selection of some USPC patients undergoing FISH analysis.","title":"Determination of HER2/neu status in uterine serous papillary carcinoma: Comparative analysis of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization.","pubmedId":"15894362"}
