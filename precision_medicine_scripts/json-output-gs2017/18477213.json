Five hundred and thirteen cases were retrospectively analyzed. HE-stained sections and clinical information were reviewed and the immunohistochemical expression of CD117, CD34, smooth-muscle actin, S-100 protein, desmin, CD44v3 adhesion molecule, p53 protein, epidermal growth factor receptor, and Ki-67 antigen was studied using tissue microarrays. Mutation analysis of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha genes was also performed. There was a slight female predominance (50.3%) and the median age at diagnosis was 59 years. The tumors were mainly located in the stomach (38.4%). Immunohistochemistry showed that CD117 was expressed in 95.7% of cases. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression was observed in 84.4% of tumors. p53 protein expression was found only in 2.6% of cases but all belonged to the high-risk group for aggressive behavior according to the National Institutes of Health consensus approach. No CD44v3 adhesion molecule expression was detected. KIT exon 11 mutations were the most frequent (62.2%). The present data confirm that gastrointestinal stromal tumors in Brazilian patients do not differ from tumors occurring in other countries.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor in Brazil: clinicopathology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular genetics of 513 cases.","pubmedId":"18477213"}
