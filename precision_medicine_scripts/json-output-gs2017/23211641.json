Two additional groups were formed from patients whose 1st OR-BP was moderately hypertensive (Mod-HTN, systolic BP\u003d140 to 159 and/or diastolic BP\u003d90 to 99; and normotensive, SBP\u003d110 to 139 and DBP\u003c89). 1st OR-BP was compared with: (1) BP before transfer to the OR (Pre-OR-BP); (2) BP during ambulatory evaluation 1 to 30 days preoperatively (Preop-Eval-BP); and (3) Baseline-BP (average of at least 3 ambulatory clinic BPs during the preceding 7 months). Comorbidity data were collected.\nFor Severe-HTNs, 1st OR-BP, and Pre-OR-BP (expressed as mean arterial pressure) exceeded Baseline-BP by 16.4±11.6 (SD) and 5.2±11.6 (SD), respectively (P\u003c0.05). Preop-Eval-BP was not different from Baseline-BP. For Mod-HTNs, 1st OR-BP exceeded Baseline-BP by 7.4±8.1 (SD) (P\u003c0.05). But, Pre-OR-BP and Preop-Eval-BP did not differ from Baseline-BP. Among normotensives, 1st OR-BP was not different from Preop-Eval-BP or Baseline-BP. Hypertension, number of antihypertensive medications, vascular diagnoses (peripheral, coronary, cerebral), diabetes, and renal disease were more common in the hypertensive groups. The number of antihypertensive medications, a history of coronary disease, and insulin administration were predictors of an increase in 1st OR-BP over Baseline-BP.\nFor most patients whose 1st OR-BP is hypertensive, that BP is greater than ambulatory clinic BPs recorded during the preceding 7 months. For most patients with Severe-HTN at 1st OR-BP, day-of-surgery BPs overestimate Baseline-BP and reference to prehospitalization BPs is advisable. When 1st OR-BP is normotensive, that BP usually reflects Baseline-BP.","title":"An observational study of the influence of \"white-coat hypertension\" on day-of-surgery blood pressure determinations.","pubmedId":"23211641"}
