Gangliogliomas consist of neoplastic ganglion and glial cells and, in contrast to infiltrative gliomas, are generally indolent. Yet distinguishing between a ganglioglioma and an infiltrative glioma with admixed gray matter can be difficult, perhaps accounting for some \"gangliogliomas\" that ultimately show aggressive behavior. In this multi-institutional study, 98 cases originally diagnosed as ganglioglioma were analyzed for IDH1 mutations, 86 of which had follow-up data available. Eight cases (8.2%) were positive for R132H IDH1 mutations; six had silent IDH2 mutations and two had nonsense IDH2 mutations. The presence of mutant IDH1 in gangliogliomas correlated with a greater risk of recurrence (P\u003d0.0007) and malignant transformation and/or death (P\u003c0.0001) compared with tumors that were IDH1 wild type. Furthermore, the age of patients with IDH1-mutant gangliogliomas was higher than those without mutations (25.5 vs. 46.1 years, P\u003d0.0033). IDH1/2 testing of tumors suspected of being gangliogliomas may therefore be advisable, particularly in the adult population.","title":"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 analysis differentiates gangliogliomas from infiltrative gliomas.","pubmedId":"21314850"}
