Our study was undertaken to evaluate whether Cytokeratin 5D3, Cytokeratin high molecular weight (HMW), Cytokeratin AE1/AE3, Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) and CA 19.9 could have a prognostic value in primarily irradiated stage FIGO III cervical cancer. We investigated 45 pretreatment punch biopsies of cervical cancer stage FIGO III. All patients underwent a combined standardised primary irradiation treatment. In the cases with expression of Cytokeratin AE1/AE3 survival was significantly better than in cases without expression. The expression of CEA also had a significantly positive effect on survival. The best prognosis was found in cases with coexpression of AE1/AE3 and CEA (Wilcoxon p \u003d 0.006, log-Rank p \u003d 0.03). The other investigated tumor associated antigen and intermediate filaments did not correlate with survival. The application of Cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and CEA allows a prediction of prognosis in patients with stage FIGO III cervical cancer undergoing irradiation treatment.","title":"Immunohistochemistry in stage FIGO III cervical cancer: prognostic value of tumor associated antigens and intermediate filaments.","pubmedId":"1284198"}
