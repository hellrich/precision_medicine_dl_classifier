The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, triggered by growth factors and hormones including vasopressin, is an important pathway that is widely involved in cellular mechanisms regulating transcription, translation, cell growth and death, cell proliferation, migration, and cell cycles. In particular, Akt and Akt substrate protein of 160 kDa (AS160) are likely to participate in the trafficking of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the kidney collecting duct. In this study, we demonstrated that 1) small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of Akt1 significantly decreased Akt1 and phospho-AS160 protein expression; and 2) confocal laser scanning microscopy of AQP2 in mouse cortical collecting duct cells (M-1 cells) revealed AS160 knockdown by siRNA increased AQP2 expression in the plasma membrane compared with controls, despite the absence of dDAVP stimulation. Thus, the results suggest that PI3K/Akt pathways could play a role in AQP2 trafficking via the AS160 protein.","title":"Membrane Trafficking of Collecting Duct Water Channel Protein AQP2 Regulated by Akt/AS160.","pubmedId":"21468198"}
