In the case of myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) tumors, the causative abnormality is a fusion between the CHOP transcription factor and the FUS or EWS genes. CHOP belongs to and is a negative regulator of the large CAAT/enhancer binding protein family whose alpha, beta, and delta members are master genes of adipogenesis. Recent clinical data indicate a peculiar sensitivity of these tumors to the natural marine compound trabectedin. One hypothesis is that the activity of trabectedin is related to the inactivation of the FUS-CHOP oncogene. We find that trabectedin causes detachment of the FUS-CHOP chimera from targeted promoters. Reverse transcription-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in a MLS line and surgical specimens of MLS patients in vivo show activation of the CAAT/enhancer binding protein-mediated transcriptional program that leads to morphologic changes of terminal adipogenesis. The activity is observed in cells with type 1 but not type 8 fusions. Hence, the drug induces maturation of MLS lipoblasts in vivo by targeting the FUS-CHOP-mediated transcriptional block. These data provide a rationale for the specific activity of trabectedin and open the perspective of combinatorial treatments with drugs acting on lipogenic pathways.","title":"Trabectedin (ET-743) promotes differentiation in myxoid liposarcoma tumors.","pubmedId":"19190116"}
