After rinsing of the gel solution (1 × TBE buffer containing 2% HEC and 1.5% HPC), the diluted PCR sample was electrokinetically injected and separated at 35°C. Several parameters were investigated for method optimization, including the kinds of polymer, capillary temperature and separation voltage. Under optimal conditions, time taken for analyzing mutations of EGFR kinase domain gene in lung cancer patients was short (within 15 min). A total of 50 lung cancer patients\u0027 tumor tissues were analyzed, and two frequent mutations associated with therapeutic efficiency of lung cancer were identified, including deletion of exon 19 (8/50) and L858R point mutation in exon 21 (12/50). This method is feasible for application in pharmacogenomic assay of lung cancer therapy. By applying this simple and effective method for genotyping of lung cancer patients, the information of pharmacogenomics was supplied for lung cancer therapy and to assist diagnosis to prolong patients\u0027 lives.","title":"Capillary electrophoretic genotyping of epidermal growth factor receptor for pharmacogenomic assay of lung cancer therapy.","pubmedId":"22901298"}
