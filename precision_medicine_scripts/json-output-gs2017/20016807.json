The anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies panitumumab and cetuximab and the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab have demonstrated clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity in the treatment of mCRC as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Recent clinical trials have explored the efficacy and safety of treatment regimens incorporating chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and either panitumumab or cetuximab in patients with mCRC. Results from the BOND-2 trial, which investigated cetuximab, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy in mCRC, provided support for this therapeutic approach. Two large randomized phase 3 trials were initiated to evaluate firstline treatment of mCRC. The Panitumumab Advanced Colorectal Cancer Evaluation (PACCE) study investigated the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab with or without panitumumab; CAIRO2 assessed the efficacy and safety of capecitabine/oxaliplatin and bevacizumab with or without cetuximab. In both trials, the combination of bevacizumab, an EGFR-specific antibody, and chemotherapy in first-line treatment of mCRC was associated with increased toxicity and no improvement in patient outcome. These results suggest that these specific combinations should not be used in first-line mCRC outside investigational studies.","title":"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor plus Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Dual Targeted Therapy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Synergy or Antagonism?","pubmedId":"20016807"}
