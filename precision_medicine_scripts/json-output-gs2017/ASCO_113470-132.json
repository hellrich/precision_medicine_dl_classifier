Their response to endocrine therapy and degree of estrogen dependence are heterogeneous. There is little data available about the genetic changes associated with disease progression in this subtype. This information could facilitate drug development.  Methods:  A series of 132 ER+/HER2- BC patients diagnosed between 1982 and 2008, with known local-regional (n\u003d10) or distant (n\u003d98) relapse or both (n\u003d24), and available FFPE blocks from their primary (P; n\u003d132) and paired relapse (R; n\u003d49) were identified at a single institution. ER and HER2 status were centrally confirmed. 120 mutations from 11 actionable genes and PTEN protein expression were determined using Fluidigm-based real-time PCR and IHC, respectively.  Results:  At primary diagnosis, median age was 57 years (27-90); median tumor size 2.5 cm (0.5-11); 75% had positive nodes, 26.5% were pre-menopausal; 80% received adjuvant hormonal treatment. Mutation frequency in P and R samples is presented in the Table. PIK3CA mutations were identified in 44% (58/132) P samples. HRAS, AKT1 and PIK3CA mutations were mutually exclusive. 62.5% (5/8) of KRAS-mutated, 75% (6/8) of MET-mutated, 100% (2/2) of BRAF-mutated and 33.3% (1/3) of FGFR3-mutated P had coexistent PIK3CA mutations. For the 49 evaluated pairs, high concordance for the mutations status was found between P and R.  Conclusions:  KRAS, BRAF, MET and FGFR3 mutations, found at relatively high frequency in this population of relapsed ER+/HER2- BCs, could represent clinically relevant targets and contribute to mechanisms of recurrence, particularly in PIK3CA-mutated BCs. Mutation profiling of additional paired samples is ongoing and clinical outcome data will be presented.% AKT1% BRAF% PIK3CA% NRAS% KRAS% EGFR% FGFR3% FLT3% HRAS% KIT% MET%PTEN lossAll P (132)6.11.54406.202.401.506.14.6Matched P (49)6.1034.708.5000206.18.1R (49)6.1036.706.10002.206.12.1","title":"Use of mutational profiling of metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancers and the coexistence of KRAS, MET, BRAF, and FGFR3 with PIK3CA mutations.","pubmedId":"ASCO_113470-132"}
