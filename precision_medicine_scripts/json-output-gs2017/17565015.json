However, it is difficult to obtain sufficient tumor samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), so these diagnoses are often made using cytology procedures alone. The aim of this study was to detect EGFR mutations in transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) samples using both direct sequencing and a highly sensitive assay (Scorpions Amplified Refractory Mutation System; DxS; Manchester, UK) [ARMS], and to compare the sensitivity of these methods.\nWe enrolled 94 patients (63 men and 31 women) with NSCLC in this study. Cytologic diagnoses were adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 58), squamous cell carcinoma (n \u003d 24), and other types of NSCLC (n \u003d 12). We extracted DNA from the TBNA samples, and EGFR mutations were analyzed using both direct sequencing (exons 19 and 21) and the Scorpions ARMS method (E746 A750del and L858R).\nMutations were detected in 31 patients (33%; 14 women and 17 men). Of these, 23 patients had adenocarcinoma, 4 had squamous cell carcinoma, and 4 had other types of NSCLC. Direct sequencing detected 13 mutations (14%) in 13 patients (E746-A750del, n \u003d 6; L858R, n \u003d 7), and the Scorpions ARMS method detected 27 mutations (29%) in 27 patients (E746 A750del, n \u003d 16; L858R, n \u003d 11 patients).\nBoth methods detected EGFR mutations in TBNA samples, but Scorpions ARMS is more sensitive than direct sequencing.","title":"Detection of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in transbronchial needle aspirates of non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"17565015"}
