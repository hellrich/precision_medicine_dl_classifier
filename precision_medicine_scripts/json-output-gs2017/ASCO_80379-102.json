Unlike colorectal cancer, liver resection is rarely given and its place remains to be defined.  The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the survival of two populations with resectable liver metastases (LM) treated for one only medically and for the other surgically preceded by a medical treatment.  Methods:  From 1988 to 2007, among 100 patients operated of liver metastases  of breast cancer at the Curie Institute, 51 were included in this case-control study. Only a positive bone scan was authorized as other metastatic localization. Operated patients received chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy before surgery and had to be either stabilized or in response. These patients were matched to 51 patients treated only medically. All patients had to have a performance status of 0-1 and the LM should be R0 resected (no residual microscopically desease) with less than 4 metastases. The matching criteria were: patient age, year of diagnosis of breast cancer, time to onset between breast cancer and metastasis, histological type, stage, and status of hormone receptors of breast cancer. The pairing was done 1/1/.  Results:  In univariate analysis, survival was better in the 2 populations if patients were  N -, had no bone metastases or were operated. In multivariate analysis only the liver resection was prognostic. In a Cox model adjusted for paired data yields a RR. \u003d 3.18 (p \u003c0.0001) in favor of surgical treatment.  Conclusions:  In a selected population, hepatic resection of metastases of breast cancer is a real benefit in terms of survival.","title":"Surgical resection of liver metastasis of breast cancer: A multidisciplinary approachStudy case-control.","pubmedId":"ASCO_80379-102"}
