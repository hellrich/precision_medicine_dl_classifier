Patients were divided into 4 groups as follows, according to the median size of early and advanced gastric cancer, respectively: small early gastric cancer (tumor size ≤3 cm), large early gastric cancer (tumor size \u003e3 cm), small advanced gastric cancer (tumor size ≤6 cm), and large advanced gastric cancer (tumor size \u003e6 cm). The prognostic value of tumor size for 5-year survival rate was investigated.\nIn a univariate analysis, tumor size is a significant prognostic factor in advanced gastric cancer, but not in early gastric cancer. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor size is an independent prognostic factor for 5-year survival rate in advanced gastric cancer (P\u003d0.003, hazard ratio\u003d1.372, 95% confidence interval\u003d1.115~1.690). When advanced gastric cancer is subdivided into 2 groups, according to serosa invasion: Group 1; serosa negative (T2 and T3, 7th AJCC), and Group 2; serosa positive (T4a and T4b, 7th AJCC), tumor size is an independent prognostic factor in Group 1 (P\u003d0.011, hazard ratio\u003d1.810, 95% confidence interval\u003d1.149~2.852) and in Group 2 (P\u003d0.033, hazard ratio\u003d1.288, 95% confidence interval\u003d1.020~1.627), respectively.\nTumor size is an independent prognostic factor in advanced gastric cancer irrespective of the serosa invasion, but not in early gastric cancer.","title":"Tumor size as a prognostic factor in gastric cancer patient.","pubmedId":"23094228"}
