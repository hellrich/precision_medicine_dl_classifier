These efforts have recently resulted in identification of a susceptibility locus for breast cancer by several groups, although the increases in risk are modest. While genome-wide association studies will probably lead to discoveries of potentially important previously unstudied pathways in cancer etiology, the role of the environment, particularly gene-environment interactions, in breast cancer etiology should not be overlooked.","title":"The promise and limitations of genome-wide association studies to elucidate the causes of breast cancer.","pubmedId":"18096087"}
