Due to the presence of thyrosine kinase receptors within the tumor tissue, GIST is thought to originate from gastrointestinal pacemaker cells, the intersticial cells of Cajal. Tumors with the same morphological and imunohistochemical characteristics detected outside the gastrointestinal tract, are called extragastrointestinal stromal tumors (EGIST). Biological characteristics of these tumors is uncertain and the malignancy rates are difficult to predict. Surgical R0 resection in resecable tumors is the only option with the potential for complete cure. Nevertheless, the recurrence rates are high. Adjuvant biological treatment with imatinib, a thyrosine kinase inhibitor, reduces the risk of relapses. Imatinib administration is also the principal treatment method in metastatic GIST disorders. The article offers a short and complex overview of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) problematics and presents a case report of a patient suffering from EGIST of mesocolon transversum treated by R0 resection which was performed under multidisciplinary cooperation, with a specialist follow up.","title":"[Extragastrointestinal stromal tumor (EGIST)--a case review].","pubmedId":"22880273"}
