Generally, increased motility and invasion are positively correlated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether BMP-2 signaling to induce gastric cancer cells to undergo EMT-mediated invasion might pass through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Herein we showed that gastric cancer cell lines express all the components of BMP-2 signaling, albeit to different extents. Moreover, an increased concentration of BMP-2 strongly enhanced motility and invasiveness in gastric cancer cells, whereas no increase was observed in cells treated with either Noggin (a BMP-2 inhibitor) or BMP-2 blocking antibodies. The stimulation of BMP-2 in gastric cancer cells induces a full EMT characterized by Snail induction, E-cadherin delocalization and down-regulation, and up-regulation of mesenchymal and invasiveness markers. Furthermore, blockade of BMP-2 signaling by Noggin or BMP-2 blocking antibodies also restored these changes in EMT markers. In addition, phosphorylation of Akt was also enhanced by treatment with BMP-2, but not Noggin or BMP-2 blocking antibodies. Pretreatment of gastric cancer cells with PI-3 kinase/Akt kinase inhibitor (kinase-dead Akt [DN-Akt], Akt siRNA, or LY294002) significantly inhibited BMP-2-induced EMT and invasiveness. Overall, our studies suggest that BMP-2 promotes motility and invasion of gastric cancer cells by activating PI-3 kinase/Akt and that targeting of this signaling pathway may provide therapeutic opportunities in preventing metastasis mediated by BMP-2.","title":"BMP2 accelerates the motility and invasiveness of gastric cancer cells via activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway.","pubmedId":"19835871"}
