The patient, an 83 year-old man, had massive generalized lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions. Serum LDH levels were elevated to 801 IU/L. Surface phenotypes were analysed by a fluorescent-activated cell sorter with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The ML cells coexpressed antigens detected by MAbs CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD24, CD38, Ia (HLA-DR), c-neu and surface immunoglobulin (Ig) G, Kappa. Gene rearrangements for the Ig JH and JK were found. Overexpression of NRAS p21 was shown by gene amplification using Southern blot analysis, while gene amplification of c-erbB-2 oncogene was also demonstrated. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate an overexpression of p185 c-neu on ML cells. These findings suggest that the p185 neu may be a prognostic indicator not only for breast adenocarcinomas but also for lymphoproliferative disorders, and that the transforming p185 protein may be involved in the mechanisms of aggressive expansion of lymphoid neoplasias.
