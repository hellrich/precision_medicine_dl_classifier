Compound 25 displayed low metabolic turnover and suitable physical properties for oral administration. In vivo, compound 25 showed pharmacodynamic modulation of AKT phosphorylation and near complete inhibition of tumour growth (93% tumour growth inhibition) in a murine H1047R PI3Kα mutated SKOV-3 xenograft tumour model after chronic oral administration at 25mg/kg b.i.d. Compound 25, also known as AZD8835, is currently in phase I clinical trials.
