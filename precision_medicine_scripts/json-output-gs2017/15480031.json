This article includes 109 pathologically proven GISTs, with emphasis on their various computed tomography (CT) features. Although the images of GISTs on the CT scan are often distinct from those of epithelial tumors, radiologists should be familiar with these features for the accurate diagnosis of GISTs.","title":"Imaging of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"15480031"}
