Tumors featuring EML4-ALK fusion constitute one subtype of NSCLC that might be highly sensitive to ALK inhibitors. Herein, we present results of a first large scale study of EML4-ALK fusion in lung cancers.\nUsing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for EML4-ALK fusion mRNA, we investigated 149 lung adenocarcinomas, 48 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 21 small-cell carcinomas. For EML4-ALK-positive cancers, we further investigated the presence of ALK fusion proteins by immunohistochemistry.\nFive of 149 adenocarcinomas (3.4%) showed EML4-ALK fusion mRNA, this being totally lacking in carcinomas of other types (0/72). In all the fusion-positive cases, ALK fusion protein could be detected in the cytoplasm immunohistochemically. The five fusion cases featured two EML4-ALK variant 1 fusions and three variant 2 fusions. Histologically, both variant 1 cases were mixed type adenocarcinomas, showing papillary with bronchioloalveolar components. Interestingly, all three variant 2 cases were acinar adenocarcinomas, the link being statistically significant (p \u003d 0.00018). None of the five fusion-positive cases demonstrated any mutations of EGFR or KRAS, pointing to a mutually exclusive relationship (p \u003d 0.014). There was no association with smoking habits.\nIn the present first investigation of EML4-ALK fusion in a large study of lung cancers (5/221), we found an interesting histotype-genotype relationship. Furthermore, we could detect the fusion protein by immunohistochemistry, pointing to possible clinical applications.","title":"EML4-ALK fusion is linked to histological characteristics in a subset of lung cancers.","pubmedId":"18166835"}
