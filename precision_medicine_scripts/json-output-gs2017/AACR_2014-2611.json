Our lab recently showed that treating melanoma cells with the FDAapproved small molecule BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib leads to an increase in ERBB3 signaling when grown in the presence of its ligand neuregulin (NRG1). Here, we show that targeting ERBB3 with a monoclonal antibody inhibits its activation and downstream signaling in the presence of vemurafenib and NRG1. This inhibition of ERBB3 led to a decrease in proliferation and increase in apoptosis in vitro as measured by EdU and AnnexinV/PI staining. Targeting ERBB3 in combination with mutant BRAF in vivo resulted in a delay of tumor re-growth in immune deficient mice compared to targeting mutant BRAF alone. Taken together, these results indicate that targeting ERBB3 in combination with mutant BRAF in melanoma may help enhance the initial effects of vemurafenib in the clinic.","title":"Function blocking ERBB3 antibody inhibits adaptive response to RAF inhibitor","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2611"}
