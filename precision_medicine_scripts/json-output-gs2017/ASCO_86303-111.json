BC is classified as pregnancy associated if it is diagnosed during pregnancy or within one year after the delivery (PABC). We propose two distinct subtypes of PABC: BC diagnosed during pregnancy and BC diagnosed post-partum. This distinction is important because epidemiologic data highlights worsened outcomes specific to post-partum cases. The safety of pregnancy after treatment of BC is an important issue for many young women. Current research does not indicate that pregnancy negatively affects survival.  Methods:  There are about 95 young women being diagnosed each year with BC in the Czech Republic. A project of clinical registry named Project 35 was launched in 2005 with the aim to collect data on epidemiology of the disease in young women. The standardization of the multidisciplinary medical treatment, genetic counselling and psychosocial support should result in better clinical outcomes and improve the quality of life.  Results:  In our project (n\u003d225) were referred 25 women with PABC, 9 patients with the diagnosis of breast cancer during the pregnancy, 16 patients within one year after the delivery. 2 patients underwent termination of the pregnancy (first trimester) before oncological treatment, in 2 patients anthracycline-based chemotherapy was administered (second trimester), and in 5 patients were induced preterm delivery (third trimester). After delivery we followed standard therapeutic guidelines. All patients are alive but three of them have metastatic disease. From 16 women treated for post-partum BC, 11 patients have complete remission, 2 are alive with metastatic disease, 1 is recovering after the surgery for local recurrence and 2 patients died due to progressive disease. 8 women are BRCA1/2 carriers. 8 women after the successful treatment of breast cancer have delivered of healthy children and are in a complete remission, despite 1 of them with local reccurence of breast cancer.  Conclusions:  PABC is rare situation, which needs to be managed individually. These patients should be treated under the supervision of the Oncological Centres. Project 35 is useful framework for the counselling in PABC.","title":"Pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC): Czech Young Breast Cancer Study Group Project 35.","pubmedId":"ASCO_86303-111"}
