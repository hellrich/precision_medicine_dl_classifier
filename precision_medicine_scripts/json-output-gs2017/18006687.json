In melanoma, proproliferative signals are provided by activating mutations in NRAS and BRAF, whereas senescence is bypassed by inactivation of the p16(Ink4a) gene. Melanomas also frequently exhibit constitutive activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway that is presumed to induce proliferation, as it does in carcinomas. We show here that, contrary to expectations, stabilized beta-catenin reduces the number of melanoblasts in vivo and immortalizes primary skin melanocytes by silencing the p16(Ink4a) promoter. Significantly, in a novel mouse model for melanoma, stabilized beta-catenin bypasses the requirement for p16(Ink4a) mutations and, together with an activated N-Ras oncogene, leads to melanoma with high penetrance and short latency. The results reveal that synergy between the Wnt and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways may represent an important mechanism underpinning the genesis of melanoma, a highly aggressive and increasingly common disease.","title":"Beta-catenin induces immortalization of melanocytes by suppressing p16INK4a expression and cooperates with N-Ras in melanoma development.","pubmedId":"18006687"}
