The first of these patients was treated with surgery, the second and third patients underwent surgery followed by conventional radiotherapy because of a tumour residue or dural tail, and the last patient was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. They recovered well and were followed by means of regular outpatient check-ups. Twenty percent of all primary brain tumours are meningiomas, over 90% of which are benign. Nevertheless, a large hospital-based population study showed a 5-year survival rate of only 70%. Microsurgery is usually the treatment of first choice. However, in about 25% of cases, excision is incomplete and tumour growth almost always continues. Further surgery influences prognosis unfavourably. New sophisticated radiation techniques help to control tumour progression in about 80-90% of cases. This success, however, may be associated with new cranial nerve deficits or panhypopituitarism. Prospective, comparative studies are not available.","title":"[\u0027Benign\u0027 meningioma].","pubmedId":"11727610"}
