Whether patients with discrepant EGFR mutation results determined by low- and high-sensitivity methods have different clinical outcomes with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment needs to be further evaluated.\nGenomic DNA from serial lung adenocarcinoma samples that were EGFR wild-type determined by direct sequencing (DS) were reanalyzed using Scorpion/Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS). The outcomes with EGFR-TKI treatment among patients with discrepant EGFR mutation results between DS and Scorpion/ARMS versus patients with EGFR mutations detected by DS were studied.\nOf the 130 tumors studied, 28 (21.5%) were found to have EGFR mutations by Scorpion/ARMS. Discrepant EGFR mutation testing results were more common in samples from nonsmokers than in samples from smokers (30.7% versus 9.1%; p \u003d 0.003) and in pleural than in nonpleural samples (62.5% versus 18.9%; p \u003d 0.012). There was no significant difference in the abundance of cancer cells in region(s) selected for testing (26.2% in tumor cell percentage â‰¤50 versus 16.9% in tumor cell percentage \u003e50; p \u003d 0.201). During EGFR-TKI treatment, the progression-free survival in patients with discrepant EGFR mutation results was similar to those with EGFR mutations detected by DS (median, 13.4 versus 10.9 months; p \u003d 0.225).\nDS overlooked EGFR mutation in a significant number of lung adenocarcinoma patients. These patients could have obtained the same benefit from EGFR-TKI when a high-sensitivity method such as Scorpion/ARMS was applied.","title":"Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of lung adenocarcinomas with discrepant EGFR mutation testing results derived from PCR-direct sequencing and real-time PCR-based assays.","pubmedId":"24346097"}
