The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that decreased expression of eIF3f could serve as a prognosis marker for poor outcome of GC patients (p \u003d 0.04). 15.9% of GC specimens were positive for Her-2/neu, but whose expression was of no correlation with patients\u0027 survival. Patients who were positive for Her-2/neu also had high eIF3f expression levels (p \u003d 0.0295).\nResults suggest that eIF3f may play an important role in recurrence, thus representing a promising predictive marker for the prognosis of GC. But Her-2/neu has no relationship with the prognosis of GC. The clinical significance of eIF3f and Her-2/neu remains to be further investigated.","title":"Clinicopathologic Implications of Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 3f and Her-2/neu Expression in Gastric Cancer.","pubmedId":"25684180"}
