Androgen deprivation therapy is well established in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy, following prostatectomy and/or radiotherapy, has been studied in the high-risk prostate cancer setting to try to reduce the risk of recurrence and improve patient outcomes. In this review, we discuss the current data for neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy with androgen suppression, chemotherapy, and approaches with the newer hormonal agents.
