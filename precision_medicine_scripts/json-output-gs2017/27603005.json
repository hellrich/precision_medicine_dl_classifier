Patients with type I/II diabetes who required insulin were excluded. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months and objective response rate.\nA total of 56 women were enrolled, including 13 (23%) with well-controlled diabetes. Reasons for discontinuation were disease progression (24 patients; 43%), adverse events (13 patients; 23%), and withdrawal by subject (12 patients; 21%). Grade 3/4 apitolisib-related adverse events were hyperglycemia (46%), rash (30%), colitis (5%), and pneumonitis (4%) (toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0]). The PFS rate at 6 months was 20% (Kaplan-Meier estimate; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 7%-33%). The objective response rate was 6% (confirmed). The median PFS was 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.7-3.7 months) and the median overall survival was 15.7 months (95% CI, 9.2-17.0 months). Nineteen patients discontinued the study before the first tumor assessment. Dose reductions were required for 4 diabetic (31%) and 18 nondiabetic (42%) patients. Comprehensive molecular profiling of 46 evaluable archival tumor samples demonstrated that 57% of patients had at least 1 alteration in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), or AKT1. All 3 patients with a confirmed response had at least 1 alteration in a PI3K pathway gene.\nThe antitumor activity noted with the use of a dose of 40 mg of apitolisib daily was limited by tolerability, especially in diabetic patients. Patients with PI3K pathway mutations may have derived enhanced benefit from apitolisib.
