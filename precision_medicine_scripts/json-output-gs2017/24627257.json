In the same period, 128 patients with cholangiocarcinoma underwent major hepatectomy with intrahepatic cholangiojejunostomy (Hx group). These groups were compared in terms of post-operative complications and survival.\nThere were no significant differences in the rate of patients with post-operative complications and in post-operative hospital stay. The overall cumulative 5-year survival rates for each procedure (Hx group, cHPR group and pHPR group) were 40, 38 and 11 %, respectively. There was no significant difference between the Hx and cHPR groups in survival rates (p \u003d 0.87).\nIn conclusion, HPR appears to be safe and feasible for selected patients with cholangiocarcinoma. However, the indications for HPR should be restricted.","title":"Surgical outcome of hilar plate resection: extended hilar bile duct resection without hepatectomy.","pubmedId":"24627257"}
