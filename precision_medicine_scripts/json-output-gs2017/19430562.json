Grade 2 serous tumors were excluded. A total of 100 patients were included for clinical evaluation. Thirty-seven patients, including 20 with low-grade and 17 with high-grade carcinomas, were selected for mutational analysis.\nThe low-grade carcinoma group was characterized by young age and premenopausal period compared with the high-grade carcinoma group, but there were no statistically significant differences in stage, metastasis of lymph node and residual disease. There were no statistically significant differences in survival rates, however, the low-grade carcinoma group showed a trend for improved progression-free survival compared with the high-grade carcinoma group of early stage (p \u003d 0.064). Mutations in KRAS and BRAF were found in 6 (30%) and 2 (10%) patients in the low-grade carcinoma group, respectively, however, they were not found in the high-grade carcinoma group. KRAS and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive, and both mutations were observed in 40% (8/20). The frequency of TP53 mutations in low-grade and high-grade carcinoma groups were found in 20% (4/20) and 70.6% (12/17), respectively (p \u003d 0.009).\nLow-grade serous carcinoma shows mutation pattern different from that with high-grade carcinoma. As there were no significant differences in stage distribution and survival, especially in advanced stage, we suggest that more studies are needed to segregate these patients into distinct disease entities.","title":"Mutational analysis of KRAS, BRAF, and TP53 genes of ovarian serous carcinomas in Korean women.","pubmedId":"19430562"}
