For first-line chemotherapy, most investigators recommended treatment with etoposide/cisplatin, with possible dosing variations according to tolerability and convenience. In France (but not elsewhere), medical oncologists tend to use a four-drug regimen (etoposide/cisplatin/cyclophosphamide/epirubicin), based on the results of an extensive-stage SCLC trial. Alternative first-line regimens, such as vincristine/ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (VICE) and topotecan/platinum, are currently being explored. Options for therapy in patients with recurrent disease are more varied, although there was consensus that active treatment at relapse should be considered. Regimens include topotecan (alone or in combination), cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine (CAV) and re-induction with the earlier first-line agents. Studies are also investigating the potential benefits of other combinations, including topotecan/vinorelbine and paclitaxel/carboplatin. For patients with relapsed extensive-stage SCLC and brain metastases, whole brain radiation therapy was considered appropriate for both palliative and therapeutic reasons. The potential role of combination therapy with topotecan/temozolomide, both of which cross the blood-brain barrier, is currently being investigated.","title":"Options for first- and second-line therapy in small cell lung cancer--a workshop discussion.","pubmedId":"14565514"}
