Results showed that squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples present clustered abnormalities with several genes altered at high frequency. Instead, esophageal adenocarcinoma (ADC) samples are characterized by a more widespread genomic instability, and in these patients total DNA copy number alterations resulted to be an independent prognostic factor. The detection of characteristic molecular changes represents a step towards a better understanding of the molecular basis of esophageal tumorigenesis, and might offer the potential for the discovery of tumor-specific biomarkers.","title":"DNA copy number profile discriminates between esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and represents an independent prognostic parameter in esophageal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"21757289"}
