Tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using KL-6 antibody.\nPositive staining of ampullary carcinoma cells was observed in 26 (68.4%) cases. Staining was not found in the surrounding non-cancer regions of the ampullary tissues. Remarkable KL-6 expression was observed in invasive carcinoma cells in pancreatic and duodenal tissues and in metastatic carcinoma cells in lymph nodes. Positive KL-6 expression was related to lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.020), pancreatic invasion (P \u003d 0.016), duodenal invasion (P \u003d 0.034), and advanced stage of TNM clinical classification (P \u003d 0.010). Survival analysis showed that positive expression of KL-6 was related to a poorer prognosis (P \u003d 0.029).\nThe aberrant expression of KL-6 mucin is significantly related to unfavorable behaviors of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.","title":"KL-6 mucin expression in carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater: association with cancer progression.","pubmedId":"16222735"}
