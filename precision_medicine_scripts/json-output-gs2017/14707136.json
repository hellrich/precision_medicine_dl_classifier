The role of Akt in cytokine production and helper T (Th) cell differentiation remains obscure. In this study, we found that enforced expression of the constitutively active form (E40K) of Akt rendered CD4(+) T cells activated. Wild-type of Akt and E40K promoted Th1 cell differentiation in C57BL/6-derived and Th1-polarized BALB/c-derived CD4(+) T cells, while both promoted Th2 cell differentiation in BALB/c-derived and Th2-polarized C57BL/6 CD4(+) T cells. E40K also facilitated Th1 differentiation in CD4(+) T cells from IL-4-deficient mice with the BALB/c background. E40K up-regulated expression of NF-AT and c-Myb, which may be related to the augmentation of cytokine production by E40K. These findings indicate that the mechanism by which Akt augments cytokine production via CD28 and ICOS is Th cell type-specific and reflects the intracellular status affected by the cytokine milieu. We conclude that Akt is a neutral amplifier of T cell activation and Th differentiation.","title":"Akt is a neutral amplifier for Th cell differentiation.","pubmedId":"14707136"}
