Combination treatment with trastuzumab is regarded currently as a first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancers that overexpress Her-2. It has become routine practice to examine the status of Her-2 expression in primary tumors. The impact of this therapy might be as great as that of endocrine therapy from a historical point of view. A number of new approaches using trastuzumab for seeking individualized treatment are being tested in current clinical trials. We reviewed recent advances in trastuzumab treatment and discuss the future of antibody therapy for breast cancer.","title":"Current status of antibody therapy for breast cancer.","pubmedId":"14718785"}
