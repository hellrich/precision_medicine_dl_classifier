We assessed the clinical benefits and safety of lung volume reduction coils (LVRCs) for the treatment of patients with severe emphysema with hyperinflation.\nIn a randomised study, we recruited patients with severe emphysema (aged ≥35 years) from three centres in the UK. Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, we randomly allocated patients in a one-to-one ratio (block sizes of four and stratified by centre) to either LVRC treatment (treatment group) or best medical care (usual care group). The primary endpoint was the difference in response in the St George\u0027s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) between treatment and usual care groups at 90 days after final treatment (by intention-to-treat analysis). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01334307.\nBetween Jan 27, 2010, to Oct 25, 2011, we recruited and randomly allocated 47 patients: 23 to treatment and 24 to usual care (23 patients in each group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis). SGRQ response at 90 days after final treatment was greater in the treatment group than it was in the usual care group (between-group difference in change from baseline -8·36 points [95% CI -16·24 to -0·47]; p\u003d0·04). We detected no between-group difference in serious adverse events.\nOur findings suggest that treatment with endobronchial coils can improve quality of life for patients with severe emphysema and hyperinflation.\nPneumRx.","title":"Endobronchial coils for the treatment of severe emphysema with hyperinflation (RESET): a randomised controlled trial.","pubmedId":"24429129"}
