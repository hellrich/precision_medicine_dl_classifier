The records of all the operated 729 meningiomas were analyzed from the patient files in the Medical Records Department. The biodata, x-rays, angiography, computed tomography (CT) scans, imaging, histopathological reports, and mortality were evaluated and results drawn.\nThe uncommon histopathological types of meningiomas (16.88%) had common locations of origin in the sphenoid ridge, posterior parafalcine, jugular foramen, peritorcular and intraventricular regions, cerebellopontine angle, and tentorial and petroclival areas. The histopathological World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I (Benign Type) meningiomas were noted in 89.30%, WHO Grade II (Atypical Type) in 5.90%, and WHO Grade III (Malignant Type) in 4.80% of all meningiomas. Meningiomas of 64.60% were found in females, 47.32% were in the age group of 41-50 years, and 3.43% meningiomas were found in children. An overall mortality of 6.04% was noted. WHO Grade III (malignant meningiomas) carried a high mortality (25.71%) and the most common sites of meningiomas with high mortality were: The cerebellopontine angles, intraventricular region, sphenoid ridge, tuberculum sellae, and the posterior parafalcine areas.\nThe correlation between the histological subtypes and the anatomical location of intracranial meningeal brain tumors, called meningiomas, is evident, but further research is required to establish the link.","title":"Histological-subtypes and anatomical location correlated in meningeal brain tumors (meningiomas).","pubmedId":"25002762"}
