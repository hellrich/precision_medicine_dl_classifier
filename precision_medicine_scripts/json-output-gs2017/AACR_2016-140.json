Although oncogenic TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and deletion of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene are established cancer driver gene alterations in CaP, they are known to be more prevalent among men of European ancestry. By utilizing carefully annotated specimens, this study focused on the discovery of recurrent genomic alterations in CaP of AA men in comparison to Caucasian Americans (CA).METHODS: Genomic DNA from clinically localized primary prostate tumors (Gleason 6 or 7 with primary pattern 3) and matched peripheral blood lymphocytes of seven AA and seven CA patients, were analyzed by paired-end sequencing on Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx to a depth of 30x. Following alignment to reference genome, somatic alterations on tumor DNA that include single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion and deletions (Indels), structural variations, copy number variations, and inter- and intra-chromosomal translocations of tumor DNA sequence were identified. To confirm prevalent genomic deletions we performed FISH analysis on a tissue microarray constructed from 42 AA and 59 CA tumor and normal samples of an independent cohort. Frequently deleted loci were further validated by analysis of TCGA CaP SNP array data from 41 AA and 279 CA prostate tumors.RESULTS: A comparative evaluation of whole genome sequences of AA and CA CaP revealed a prevalent deletion of the LSAMP locus of chromosome 3q13.31 in AA CaP. These observations were confirmed by SNP array and FISH assays in independent cohorts of specimens. AA CaP patients with LSAMP deletion showed rapid disease progression. In contrast to higher frequency of LSAMP deletion, significantly lower frequencies of PTEN and ERG alterations were noted in CaP of AA men. Furthermore, CaP genomes of AA men displayed a higher rate of inter-chromosomal rearrangements than those from CA men.CONCLUSIONS: We highlight distinct features of AA and CA CaP genomes including common CaP driver genes (TMPRSS2- ERG, PTEN) and define a novel recurrent deletion of the LSAMP locus. This study underscores the need for careful evaluations of cancer genomes in underrepresented populations in the global context with implications for precision medicine strategies.","title":"LSAMP gene deletion is associated with rapid disease progression in prostate cancer of African American men","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-140"}
