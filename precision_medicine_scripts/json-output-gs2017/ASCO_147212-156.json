The LACE-Bio group evaluated coexisting KRAS/TP53 mutations in resected NSCLC and found chemotherapy to be deleterious in patients with double mutations.  Methods:  In an attempt to validate these results,NSCLC patients from Princess Margaret Cancer Centre who were tested for KRAS \u0026 TP53 mutations and received chemotherapy for any stage NSCLC were selected. Mutation status was analyzed using Mi-SEQ or Sequenom platforms. TP53 analysis was added for DNA sequenced by Sequenom. Mutation status was correlated with clinical and demographic data. Relapse- or progression-free survival (RFS, PFS) was the main endpoint.  Results:  Among 186 patients identified, 24 had coexisting KRAS/TP53 mutations, 67 TP53, 27 KRAS; 68 had no KRAS or TP53 mutation (WT/WT). No difference was seen in age, sex or stage among the 4 populations (p \u003d 0.09, p \u003d 0.23, p \u003d 0.36, respectively). There were significantly more Caucasians (96 v 65%, p \u003d 0.009), smokers (29 v 14%, p \u003d 0.007) and adenocarcinoma (96 v 73%, p \u003d 0.046) in the KRAS/TP53 group. 5-year overall survival (OS) was higher in the WT/WT group (68%) compared to KRAS/TP53 48%, KRAS 42%, TP53 41% (log-rank p \u003d 0.02). However, no significant OS difference was seen for KRAS/TP53 compared to the othergroups (HR 1.41, CI 0.81-2.45, p \u003d 0.23). Among 98 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in RFS for the KRAS/TP53 group v all others (HR 1.47, CI 071-3.08, p \u003d 0.3). For 30 stage III patients who received concurrent chemo-XRT, there was no PFS difference for the KRAS/TP53 group v all others (HR 0.80, CI 0.30-2.15, p \u003d 0.65). For 85 patients who received 1st-line palliative chemotherapy, there was no difference in PFS in the KRAS/TP53 group v the others (HR 1.05, CI 0.59-1.87, p \u003d 0.87). Similarly, in 43 patients who received 2nd-line chemotherapy, there was no difference in PFS comparing the KRAS/TP53 group to the others (HR 1.18, CI 0.45-3.13, p \u003d 0.73).  Conclusions:  We could identify no significant difference in OS, RFS or PFS for patients with NSCLC harboring coexisting KRAS/TP53 mutations who received chemotherapy for any stage compared to patients with KRAS or TP53 mutation or WT/WT tumors.","title":"Predictive value of coexisting KRAS and TP53 mutations on response to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_147212-156"}
