Obese women (recent BMI 30-33.99) had a 3-fold increased risk (OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.0-4.0), and markedly obese women (recent BMI \u003e or \u003d 34) a 6-fold increased risk (OR 6.3, 95% CI 4.2-9.5). The OR for Type 2 diabetes mellitus was 1.5 (95% CI 1.0-2.1) and for Type 1 diabetes mellitus it was 13.3 (3.1-56.4). The effect of recent BMI was similar for tumors having different degrees of differentiation and myometrial invasion, and did not vary with age, time since menopause, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, and use of contraceptives. Hypertension increased risk only among obese women. BMI at age 18, height, and adult weight change were not independent risk factors.\nRecent overweight/obesity and diabetes mellitus (Types 1 and 2) are associated with endometrial cancer risk. Hypertension increases risk among obese women.","title":"Body size in different periods of life, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and risk of postmenopausal endometrial cancer (Sweden).","pubmedId":"10710204"}
