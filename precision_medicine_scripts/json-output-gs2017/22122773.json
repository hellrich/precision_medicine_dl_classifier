Chemopreventive strategies to reduce the incidence of gastric cancer are required, particularly as the number of deaths per year is likely to rise for the foreseeable future. There is some evidence that population screening and treatment for Helicobacter pylori in high-risk populations may reduce incidence of gastric cancer. Trials studying the effect of anti-oxidants and selenium are conflicting. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that aspirin use led to a reduced risk of gastric cancer after 10-20 years of follow-up. There is little convincing evidence that statins have any effect on risk of gastric cancer. More trials on chemoprevention for gastric cancer are therefore urgently required.","title":"Chemoprevention for gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"22122773"}
