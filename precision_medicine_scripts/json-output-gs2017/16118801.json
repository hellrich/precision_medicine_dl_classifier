Therefore, the authors evaluated the impact of permanent prostate brachytherapy on the relative rates of the use of specific prostate carcinoma treatment modalities over time.\nSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data from 1995 to 2000 were analyzed in a longitudinal, observational study utilizing bivariate and multivariate techniques.\nDifferential changes in the use of specific definitive treatment modalities were noted by region, age group, racial/ethnic group, and marital status. Increasing use of permanent prostate brachytherapy, with and without concomitant EBRT, was proportional to the decreasing use of radical prostatectomy alone and EBRT alone over time.\nThe current study revealed that permanent prostate brachytherapy appears to be replacing other treatment modalities in increasing numbers of clinically localized prostate carcinoma cases. Persistent regional, racial/ethnic, marital status, and age-related differences in the use of permanent prostate brachytherapy merit further investigation.","title":"Impact of brachytherapy on regional, racial, marital status, and age-related patterns of definitive treatment for clinically localized prostate carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16118801"}
