Recent developments in the area of immunotherapy as well as targeted therapy showed rapid development and excellent results. The anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab, which was approved in the USA and Europe in 2011, was the first substance in melanoma therapy to demonstrate an overall survival benefit. Another approval is expected in Europe for the specific BRAF-inhibitor vemurafenib, which has shown a significant impact on progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with the BRAF(V600E)  mutation. In this review the relevant agents in the substance classes of immunomodulatory drugs and small molecules are presented and discussed, and future prospects for combination therapies and developments in melanoma treatment are outlined.","title":"Current advances and perspectives in the treatment of advanced melanoma.","pubmedId":"22432863"}
