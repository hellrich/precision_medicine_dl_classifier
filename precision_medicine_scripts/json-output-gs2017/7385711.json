Radiation pathomorphosis of tumors was studied, and the data obtained were compared with the late results of treatment in such patients. There was noted a high prognostic significance of local regression of a primary tumor focus in cervical cancer. Simple morphological signs of tumor regression under radiation were singled out, and it seems possible to assess quantitatively the rate of tumor regression for a group of patients. Use of the suggested method may enable a comparison to be made between different methods of radiotherapy for cancer of the uterine cervix, thus assessing their ultimate efficacy already during the treatment.","title":"[Morphological criteria of radiation therapy effectiveness in cervical cancer].","pubmedId":"7385711"}
