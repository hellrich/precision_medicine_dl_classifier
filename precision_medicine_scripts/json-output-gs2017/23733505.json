However, genetic studies unexpectedly suggested that wild-type (WT) Ras exerts tumor suppressor activity. Expressing oncogenic Nras(G12D) in the hematopoietic compartment of mice induces an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm that is exacerbated in homozygous mutant animals. Here, we show that increased Nras(G12D) gene dosage, but not inactivation of WT Nras, underlies the aggressive in vivo behavior of Nras(G12D/G12D) hematopoietic cells. Modulating Nras(G12D) dosage had discrete effects on myeloid progenitor growth, signal transduction, and sensitivity to MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibition. Furthermore, enforced WT N-Ras expression neither suppressed the growth of Nras-mutant cells nor inhibited myeloid transformation by exogenous Nras(G12D). Importantly, NRAS expression increased in human cancer cell lines with NRAS mutations. These data have therapeutic implications and support reconsidering the proposed tumor suppressor activity of WT Ras in other cancers.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of Ras -induced transformation and adaptive cellular responses is fundamental. The observation that oncogenic Nras lacks tumor suppressor activity, whereas increased dosage strongly modulates cell growth and alters sensitivity to MEK inhibition, suggests new therapeutic opportunities in cancer.","title":"Dominant role of oncogene dosage and absence of tumor suppressor activity in Nras-driven hematopoietic transformation.","pubmedId":"23733505"}
