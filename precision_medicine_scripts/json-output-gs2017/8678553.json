There were significant differences in the survival rate and the incidence of tumor recurrence between diploid and aneuploid tumors, especially the poor survival rate and frequent tumor recurrence in the aneuploid tumor with DI above 1.5. Cox\u0027s multiple regression proportional hazard model was used to investigate the prognostic value of DNA ploidy pattern, DI and clinicopathological findings. From these analyses, DI 1.5 was found to be the most significant prognostic factor. These results suggest that flow cytometrically evaluated DI values have a relevant independent power for predicting the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients.","title":"[DNA index as a significant prognostic indicator of colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"8678553"}
