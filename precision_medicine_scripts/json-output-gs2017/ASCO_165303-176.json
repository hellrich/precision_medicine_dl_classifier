Methods: Clinical data of 1048 patients with histologically verified stage I-IV cervical cancer were studied retrospectively. 236 (22.5%) of 1048 patients developed recurrences. Frequency and time of recurrences were compared with patients age, disease stage, morphological structure and type of growth of primary tumor; DFS was analyzed. Results: Age of patients with newly diagnosed cervical cancer was 20-75 years, mean age 50.51.3; almost a third of cases (27.8%) were women under 40 years of age. Recurrences were more frequent in patients of 50-59 (25.2%) and 40-49 (24.8%) y.o. Recurrence rate in stage I was 8.3%, stage II  21.3%, stage III  29.1%, and stage IV  43.5%. A significant proportion of women with recurrences (44.9%) had stage III disease. Recurrence rate in patients with squamous cell CC was 20.6%, adenocarcinoma  33.6%, adenosquamous carcinoma  28.6%, and poorly differentiated cancer  42.8%. High recurrence rate was observed in patients with prognostically unfavorable types of primary tumor growth: crateriform  44.6%, endophytic  26.5%, mixed type  28.9%. 62.3% of patients developed recurrences during the first 1.5 years after primary treatment, 20.3% - in 1.5-2 years. Conclusions: The majority of CC patients prior to the primary treatment already had clinical signs that determine aggressive course of the disease with a tendency to early recurrence development. Recurrence rate was highly determined by the disease stage, morphological structure and the type of primary tumor growth.","title":"Prognostic factors of cervical cancer recurrence.","pubmedId":"ASCO_165303-176"}
