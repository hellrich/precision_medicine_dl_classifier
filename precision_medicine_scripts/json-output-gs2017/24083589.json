Twenty mice were randomized into two groups: experimental group receiving gemcitabine plus cisplatin and control group receiving 0.9% physiological saline. The expressions of hENTl and ERCC1 mRNA in tumor tissue were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. The volume of tumor, the weight of nude mice and tumor volume were respectively measured and calculated 2-3 times per week. Tissue samples were collected from NSCLC mice treated with gemcitabine plus carboplatin.\nThe histological examination showed that many tumor cells were well preserved in nude mice. The rate of transplanted tumor cells was 86.7%. The concomitant treatment study showed that the rate of TV, RTV, T/C in GEM + DDP group was the lowest. LBP + DOC, DDP + DOC obviously influenced the body weight. Compared with NS group, DDP group, GEM group, the survival period and the level of hENTl of DDP+GEM group increased obviously, the level of ERCC1 decreased significantly (P\u003c0.05).\nThe expression of hENT1 and ERCC1 genes in tumor tissues were closely correlated with the response to chemotherapy and prognosis of patients with NSCLC treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin.","title":"Expression of hENTl and ERCC1 genes in tumor tissues non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24083589"}
