A total of 251 gains and 84 losses were detected. The most frequent gains involved subregions of chromosomal arms 12q and 20q (70% each), 5p (57%), 6q and 9q (52% each), 1q, 7p and 17p (48% each), 1p (43%), 6p and 17q (39% each), 20p and 22q (35% each) as well as 7q and 12p (30% each). The same subregions were also affected by 30 high level amplifications. The most frequent losses were found in subregions of chromosomal arms 13q (35%) as well as 11q and 12p (30% each). Overall, gains of chromosomal material were more frequent than losses (p \u003c 0.001). There were significant differences in the frequency and distribution of recurrent chromosomal imbalances between pleomorphic liposarcomas and the dedifferentiated areas of dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Gains of chromosomal material detected predominantly in pleomorphic liposarcomas involved subbands 5p13-p15 (p \u003c 0.010), 1p21 (p \u003c 0.019), 1q21-q22 (p \u003c 0.040) and 7q22 (p \u003c 0.049). Conversely, high level amplifications within chromosomal subregion 12q13-q21 were only found in the dedifferentiated components of dedifferentiated liposarcomas (p \u003c 0.001). Overall, both gains and the less pronounced losses of chromosomal material were more frequent in pleomorphic than in dedifferentiated liposarcomas (p \u003c 0.001 and p \u003c 0.025, respectively). These results show that pleomorphic liposarcomas display a considerable number of recurrent chromosomal imbalances that are essentially different from those present in high-grade areas of dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Therefore, genetic data are considered as a helpful diagnostic adjunct for the discrimination between these 2 types of liposarcoma. The overall higher frequency of chromosomal imbalances in pleomorphic as compared to dedifferentiated liposarcomas could account for the more aggressive biological behavior of pleomorphic relative to dedifferentiated liposarcoma types.","title":"Distinct chromosomal imbalances in pleomorphic and in high-grade dedifferentiated liposarcomas.","pubmedId":"11948494"}
