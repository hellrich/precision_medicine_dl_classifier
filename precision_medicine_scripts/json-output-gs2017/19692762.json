In half of the patients with recurrences after hepatectomy for liver metastasis, the first site of recurrence is the remnant liver. Furthermore, most patients with recurrence develop metastases. Despite the fact, that adjuvant chemotherapy has been proven very successful in primary colorectal cancer, there is only recent evidence of a benefit after liver surgery. To improve the survival for colorectal liver metastasis, surgery may be combined with adjuvant chemotherapy. In the future, the safety and effectiveness should be determined by clinical trials. The optimal dose, schedule, and combination of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil plus leucovorin, the presently most effective drugs in colorectal cancer, must be assessed. In this paper, we describe the current status of liver resection and chemotherapy for liver metastasis from colorectal cancer with a review of the literature. Multidisciplinary care and the improved outcomes that are available when we integrate the best of medical and surgical oncology are important.","title":"[Chemotherapy and hepatectomy for liver metastasis from colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"19692762"}
