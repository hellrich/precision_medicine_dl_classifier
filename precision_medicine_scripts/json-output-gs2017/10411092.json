Multiple microsatellite markers were used to determine allelic loss on chromosome 16q.\nOverall loss on 16q was seen in 31% of the cancers, and occurred more frequently in high stage cancers than low stage cancers. In contrast, allelic loss in PIN failed to exceed 6% at any of the loci that were examined.\nThese results suggest that inactivation of a putative tumor suppressor gene on 16q may be involved in the progression of some prostate cancers.","title":"Chromosome 16 allelic loss analysis of a large set of microdissected prostate carcinomas.","pubmedId":"10411092"}
