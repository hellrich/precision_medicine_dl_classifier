The results were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcome.\nAbsent p16 expression and reduced MITF expression were both associated with the adverse prognostic markers ulceration (p\u003d0.009 and p\u003c0.0001, respectively), advanced tumour stage (p\u003c0.0001 and p\u003d0.001, respectively) and higher Breslow thickness (both p\u003c0.0001), as well as with an adverse overall relapse-free survival (p\u003c0.0001 and p\u003d0.003, respectively). Absence of p16 expression predicted overall relapse-free (p\u003d0.02) and distant metastasis-free (p\u003d0.04) survival, independently of Breslow thickness, ulceration and tumour stage.\nIHC determined p16 expression is an independent prognostic biomarker of potential value in routine melanoma diagnostic practice.","title":"Immunohistochemical analysis of molecular drivers in melanoma identifies p16 as an independent prognostic biomarker.","pubmedId":"24607493"}
