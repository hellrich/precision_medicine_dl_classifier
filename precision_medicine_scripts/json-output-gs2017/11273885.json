We report a 69-year-old white man with a history of high-grade prostate carcinoma and widely metastatic adenocarcinoma who presented with metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hypertension secondary to ectopic ACTH and CRH secretion. Laboratory values were consistent with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Markedly elevated serum cortisol (135 microg/dL), ACTH (1,387 pg/dL), CRH (69 pg/dL), and urine free cortisol (16,276 microg/24 h) levels were found. Chest computed tomographic (CT) scan showed small noncalcified parenchymal densities; however, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage washings were unremarkable for a neoplastic process. Abdominal CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple small liver lesions and multiple thoracic and lumbar intensities consistent with diffuse metastatic disease. Histological analysis of a biopsy specimen from the thoracic spine showed an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with a prostate primary tumor. The severe metabolic alkalosis secondary to glucocorticoid-induced excessive mineralocorticoid activity was treated with potassium supplements, spironolactone, and ketoconazole. In this case report, we describe an unusual tumor associated with ectopic ACTH and CRH production and the pharmacodynamic relationship of plasma cortisol levels and urinary cortisol excretion with ketoconazole treatment.","title":"Hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypertension: Cushing\u0027s syndrome in a patient with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"11273885"}
