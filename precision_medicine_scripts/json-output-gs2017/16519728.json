On the history, the owner complained of chronic abdominal enlargement initiated more than 4 months ago, reduced appetite, occasional vomiting and general dullness. He also complained of greenish mucous intermittent vaginal discharge starting 10 days ago. The bitch was chronically treated with medroxiprogesterone acetate. A laparatomy was performed and fluid in the abdomen was found and aspirated during the surgery. Also a very fluid-filled distended uterus and a mass in the distal part of the left uterine horn were found. The mass was encapsulated by the omentum, but areas of necrosis and calcification were identified. Histopathological diagnosis was endometrial adenocarcinoma.","title":"Endometrial adenocarcinoma and mucometra in a 6-year-old Alaska Malamute dog.","pubmedId":"16519728"}
