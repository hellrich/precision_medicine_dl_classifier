Controversy exists about the utility of sentinel node biopsy (SNB), either before or after NAC. With the addition of trastuzumab in the treatment of Her2/neu-positive LABC patients, the validity of SNB in this subset population needs to be investigated. A retrospective study of 20 patients who underwent NAC for LABC was undertaken. The pathology of the axillary nodes, sentinel nodes, and primary tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were examined. Twenty patients underwent NAC with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed sequentially by paclitaxel and carboplatin, with or without trastuzumab based on Her2/neu status. Post chemotherapy, 20 patients underwent mastectomy or lumpectomy with SNB with axillary node dissections. The overall accuracy of SNB was 95 per cent with a false-negative rate of 14 per cent (1/7). In Her2/neu-positive patients, overall accuracy was 100 per cent (8/8) and a false-negative rate of zero per cent. Sentinel node biopsy is a viable option in patients who have undergone NAC. Her2/neu-positive patients who had undergone NAC with trastuzumab had comparable accuracy for sentinel node biopsy in predicting axillary node status.","title":"The predictive value of sentinel lymph node biopsy in locally advanced breast cancer patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"17983061"}
