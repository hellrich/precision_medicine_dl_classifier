It remains a challenge for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer. Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2) is a new tumor suppressive gene and plays important roles in many cancers. However, the role of SATB2 in gastric cancer is still unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that downregulation of SATB2 was associated with shortened survival in patients with gastric cancer. Ectopic expression of SATB2 inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Overexpression of SATB2 repressed the expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5), and activation of ERK5 restored the SATB2-induced inhibition of proliferation and migration in gastric cancer. This study provided evidence that SATB2 acted as a tumor suppressive gene gastric cancer, serving as a potential therapeutic target.
