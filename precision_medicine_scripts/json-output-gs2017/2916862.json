One hundred forty-seven patients were analyzed who had their primary resectable colorectal carcinomas resected with curative intent from 1974 to 1981. Aneuploid colorectal cancers (i.e., tumors with abnormal DNA content) tended to be less well-differentiated, to invade the serosa or extend beyond, and to have lymph node metastases rather than diploid tumors (i.e., tumors with normal DNA content). A significantly increased rate of recurrent disease was demonstrated in patients with aneuploid tumors as opposed to those with diploid tumors (46.7% vs. 4.8%, respectively [p less than 0.001]). In addition, patients with aneuploid tumors exhibited a significantly decreased disease-free and overall survival in comparison with patients with diploid colorectal carcinomas. A Cox regression analysis demonstrated that tumor DNA content was the single most important factor in predicting recurrence or death from colorectal carcinoma.","title":"Tumor DNA content in resectable, primary colorectal carcinoma.","pubmedId":"2916862"}
