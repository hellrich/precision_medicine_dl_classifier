We previously mapped a major gene affecting AHL in C57BL/6J mice. Here, we show that the same Chromosome 10 gene (Ahl) is a major contributor to AHL in nine other inbred mouse strains-129P1/ReJ, A/J, BALB/cByJ, BUB/BnJ, C57BR/cdJ, DBA/2J, NOD/LtJ, SKH2/J, and STOCK760. F1 hybrids between each of these inbred strains and the normal-hearing inbred strain CAST/Ei retain good hearing, indicating that inheritance of AHL is recessive. To follow segregation of hearing loss, F1 hybrids were backcrossed to the parental strains with AHL. Auditory-evoked brain-stem response thresholds were used to assess hearing in more than 1500 N2 mice and analyzed as quantitative traits for linkage associations with Chromosome 10 markers. Highly significant linkage was found in all nine strain backcrosses, with the highest probability (LOD \u003e 70) near the marker D10Mit112. This map position for Ahl is near the waltzer mutation (v) and the modifier of deaf waddler locus (mdfw), suggesting the possibility of allelism. Results from an intercross of C57BL/6J and NOD/LtJ mice indicate that the 6- to 10-month difference in AHL onset between these two strains is not due to allelic heterogeneity of the Ahl gene.","title":"A major gene affecting age-related hearing loss is common to at least ten inbred strains of mice.","pubmedId":"11112345"}
