Hypermethylation of MGMT promoter region can silence its expression and results in MGMT- mediated DNA repair deficiency that may be responsible for better outcome of GBM patients treated with temozolomide. In addition, recent studies suggest that somatic mutations in NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase encoded by IDH1 and IDH2 occur in small fraction of GBMs and that patients with such tumors have a better outcome than those with wild-type IDH1/2. Methods: DNA was isolated from fresh frozen primary tumor biopsies from 115 adult patients with histologically proven GBM. Direct sequencing of mutational \"hot spots\" (exon 4) of IDH1 and IDH2 was performed. The methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to detect epigenetic silencing of MGMT. The clinical outcome of patients was correlated with the observed molecular changes. Results: The IDH1 mutations were identified in 5/115 (4.3%) samples the mutation in while the IDH2 mutations were not found. All mutations affected codon R132 of IDH1: p.R132H (c.395G \u003e A) in four tumors, and p.R132C (c.394C \u003e T) in one sample. Among patients whose tumors carried mutation, two died after 21 and 46 months, respectively. Three others remain free of disease with a follow up of 18 to 65 months. The median survival time of patients with a tumor not carrying IDH1 mutation was 11.6 months. Methylation of MGMT was found in 44.3% (51/115) of samples and the presence of the promoter methylation correlated with better survival in the studied cohort (median of 14.4 vs. 11.57 months respectively, p \u003d 0.045). All tumors carrying IDH1 mutation also exhibited methylation of the MGMT promoter. Conclusions: Our study confirms that although mutations in IDH1 are rare events (\u003c 5%) in primary glioblastoma, they represent a strong prognostic biomarker for a good clinical outcome of patients with GBM, and seem to be associated with MGMT promoter methylation.","title":"MGMT promoter methylation and IDH1 mutation as prognostic markers for a favorable clinical outcome in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.","pubmedId":"ASCO_52126-74"}
