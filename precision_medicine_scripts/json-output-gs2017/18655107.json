We previously showed that primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes (MEK) expressing a v-ras(Ha) oncogene undergo hyperproliferation followed by growth arrest and senescence that was dependent on TGFbeta1 signaling and associated with increased levels of p16(ink4a) and p19(ARF). Here we show that the induction of both p16(ink4a) and p19(ARF) in v-ras(Ha) expressing keratinocytes is dependent on TGFbeta1 signaling, as TGFbeta1 treatment or Smad3 overexpression induces both p16(ink4a) and p19(ARF) protein and mRNA, while Smad3 depletion or Smad7 overexpression blocks induction. Genetic ablation of the cdkn2a (ink4a/arf) locus reduced sensitivity to TGFbeta1 mediated cell cycle arrest and induction of senescence suggesting that alteration of TGFbeta1 responses may be an additional pathway impacted by the inactivation of cdkn2a locus during tumor development.","title":"Induction of p16ink4a and p19ARF by TGFbeta1 contributes to growth arrest and senescence response in mouse keratinocytes.","pubmedId":"18655107"}
