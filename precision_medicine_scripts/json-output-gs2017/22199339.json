Detection of BRAF gene mutation and analyses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are of great scientific interest.\nThe study included 581 NSCLC patients (377 males, 204 female) undergoing pulmonary resection. BRAF gene mutations were screened using the PCR-SSCP method and were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2), and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) gene were also analyzed.\nFive patients (0.8%) had BRAF mutations within exon 15. In 581 NSCLC patients, EGFR gene mutations within exons 18 to 21 were detected in 191 (32.8%) patients, KRAS codon 12 mutations in 56 (9.6%) patients, and ERBB2 codon 20 mutations in 11 (1.8%) patients. All mutations were mutually exclusive. The NSCLC patients with BRAF mutations were proved to be men who were heavy smokers.\nPCR-SSCP analysis of BRAF exon 15 in NSCLC patients without other gene mutations may be sufficient to identify candidates for treatment.","title":"Clinical significance of BRAF gene mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22199339"}
