We report a 13-year-old girl with simultaneous occurrence of lung adenocarcinoma and osteosarcoma. The patient was admitted with lower leg pain, and an abnormal shadow in the right fibula was noted on X-ray examination. Further examination of the fibular lesion including tumor biopsy revealed an osteosarcoma. Following completion of the first course of preoperative chemotherapy, multiple lung shadows were found on chest X-ray films. After five courses of preoperative chemotherapy, however, all lung shadows except one in the right lower lobe disappeared. The fibular tumor was then resected. Postoperatively, an additional six courses of chemotherapy was given. However, the lung shadow in the right lower lobe was still present. Exploratory thoracotomy was performed. Pathologically, the lung tumor measured 0.8 cm in diameter with an ill-defined border, and histological examination revealed a well differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma. To our knowledge, only a few cases of pediatric lung cancers have been reported to be associated with congenital cystic malformation of the lung. However, this combination of pediatric lung adenocarcinoma and osteosarcoma has not been previously reported.","title":"Simultaneous occurrence of lung adenocarcinoma and fibular osteosarcoma in a 13-year-old girl.","pubmedId":"8184398"}
