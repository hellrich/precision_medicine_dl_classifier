Tedious experiments are often required to determine which tumor types have amplifications of a specific oncogene. To facilitate rapid screening for molecular alterations in many different malignancies, a tissue microarray consisting of samples from 17 different tumor types was generated. Altogether, 397 individual tumors were arrayed in a single paraffin block. To determine whether results from the literature can be reproduced on minute tissue samples (diameter, 0.6 mm), amplification of three extensively studied oncogenes (CCND1, CMYC, and ERBB2) was analyzed in three fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments from consecutive sections cut from the tissue microarray. Amplification of CCND1 was found in breast, lung, head and neck, and bladder cancer, as well as in melanoma. ERBB2 was amplified in bladder, breast, colon, stomach, testis, and lung cancer. CMYC was amplified in breast, colon, kidney, lung, ovary, bladder, head and neck, and endometrial cancer. These results confirm and even extend existing data in the literature on such amplifications. In summary, we applied three fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments to analyze amplifications of three oncogenes in three x 397 tumors within a week. This demonstrates the power of using minute arrayed tissue specimens for tumor screening.","title":"Tissue microarrays for gene amplification surveys in many different tumor types.","pubmedId":"10473073"}
