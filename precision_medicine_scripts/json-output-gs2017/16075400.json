It has been associated with mutations in the NTRK1 gene, located in 1q21-22 and encoding a high-affinity NGF receptor.\nAn 8-year-old boy, the first son of consanguineous parents, presented with hypotonia, episodic hyperpyrexia and global developmental delay since the neonatal period. In addition to these signs, typical of CIPA, he displayed some other not previously described in this disease, such as facial dysmorphism, a severe swallowing disorder and a myogenic EMG pattern, that led to the initial suspicion of a muscle disorder. Molecular genetics studies uncovered a mutation c.C2011T in exon 15 of the NTRK1 gene. Genetic counselling was possible in the following pregnancy of the couple, where the female fetus was found to harbour the mutation in heterozygosity. The subsequent diagnosis of a congenital myasthenic syndrome in this sister led to neurophysiological re-evaluation of the probandus, in whom a myasthenic pattern of muscle activation was also found.\nA patient with CIPA and congenital myasthenic syndrome is described. CIPA must be the first diagnostic hypothesis when assessing a patient with insensitivity to pain, anhidrosis and self-mutilation. Given the rather homogeneous presentation of CIPA, the occurrence of atypical myopathic manifestations should raise the suspicion of a concurrent disorder. The present consanguineous kindred illustrates a rare instance of transmission of two mutated alleles giving rise to two unrelated, infrequent neurological syndromes.","title":"[Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis associated with congenital myasthenic syndrome].","pubmedId":"16075400"}
