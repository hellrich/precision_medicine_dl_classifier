The precancerous and early stages of colorectal carcinoma can be detected by routine diagnostic measures (colonoscopy) with an adequate degree of reliability. A curative treatment of precursor and early stages of colorectal carcinoma is possible. As a rule, the procedure used is endoscopic polypectomy. A lowering of the incidence rates and mortality figures of large-bowel carcinoma through the routine detection and thoroughgoing endoscopic treatment of precursors of colorectal carcinoma would appear possible. The conclusion follows logically from the established points 1 to 3. The significance of polypectomy in the large bowel, which today is carried out routinely using a standardized technique, is to be seen in the prevention and early detection of colorectal carcinomas.","title":"Significance of polypectomy in the large bowel--endoscopy.","pubmedId":"6872977"}
