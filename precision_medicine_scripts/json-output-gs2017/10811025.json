Conclusion. Even among patients with tubular adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, if the patient is aged and has chronic pancreatitis, the main pancreatic duct and duct of Santorini may dilate to the same degree as in mucin-hypersecreting neoplasm.","title":"A case of pancreatic carcinoma with marked ductal dilatation: what contributed to the dilatation?","pubmedId":"10811025"}
