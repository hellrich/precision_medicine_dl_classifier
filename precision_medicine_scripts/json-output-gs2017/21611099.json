Pancreatoduodenectomy is a standard surgical procedure for cancer of the pancreatic head, and is now indicated even for elderly patients over 80 years of age. Pancreatoduodenectomy with combined resection of the peripancreatic vessels has improved survival, but extended resection including lymph nodes is considered to have no extra survival benefit. Furthermore, laparoscopic resection procedures including pancreatoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, enucleation and central pancreatectomy can now be performed safely. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine may further improve the surgical outcome. An understanding of the oncological aspects of pancreatic cancer and the development of surgical techniques and chemotherapy may further contribute to improving the outcome of surgery for pancreatic cancer.","title":"Recent advances and limitations of surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"21611099"}
