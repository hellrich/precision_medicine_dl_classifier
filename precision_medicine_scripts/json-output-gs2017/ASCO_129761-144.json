Retrospective studies suggest inferior outcomes for Ipi in atypical cohorts of melanoma (uveal, mucosal) compared to unselected populations. Acral melanoma (AM) is an uncommon subtype of melanoma with a poor prognosis. The clinical activity of Ipi has not been well defined in advanced AM.  Methods:  To assess the activity of Ipi in this cohort, we retrospectively reviewed the demographics, treatment history, and clinical outcomes for all patients (pts) with AM treated with Ipi from two centers between February 2006 and June 2013.  Using Cox proportional hazards models, we assessed for factors that correlated with OS.  Results:  Of 35 patients with advanced AM who received Ipi, 28 were Caucasian, 6 were black, and 1 was Hispanic. Primary tumors arose on the volar surfaces in 28 and subungual sites in 7. Of 31 genotyped patients, 3 had mutations in BRAFV600E, 2 in NRAS, and 4 in CKIT. Stage IVc disease was present in 19 pts, IVb in 6, IVa in 5, and III in 5; 45% had elevated LDH. Median number of prior therapies was 1 (range 0-3) including targeted agents in 6 pts and immune-based therapies in 5. The median number of Ipi doses received was 4 (33 pts with 3mg/kg dosing and 2 with 10mg/kg). Best response by immune-related response criteria (irRC) was complete response in 1 pt, partial response in 3, and stable disease (SD) in 5 for an objective response rate (ORR) of 11.4% and clinical benefit (ORR + SD) at 24 weeks of 25.7%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) from initiation of Ipi was 2.6 months (mo) (95% CI 2.2-3 mo); median OS was 16.7 mo (95% CI 11-22.5 mo). Normal LDH and absolute lymphocyte count 1000 at 7 weeks predicted longer OS; metastatic stage, and timing or site of initial recurrence did not influence OS. Toxicities were similar to previous Ipi trials; 16 pts had an immune-related adverse event (irAE) and 7 pts had grade 3 irAEs (colitis in 2, hypophysitis in 3, and hepatitis and dermatitis in 1 each).  Conclusions:  Ipi induced clinical responses in pts with AM with similar ORR, PFS, and OS compared to unselected populations. Treatment was generally well-tolerated with a comparable toxicity profile to previous trials. Ipi remains an appropriate therapy option for pts with advanced AM.","title":"Ipilimumab in acral melanoma: A retrospective review.","pubmedId":"ASCO_129761-144"}
