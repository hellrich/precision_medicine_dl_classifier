GISTs have since been recognized as separate pathological entities among sarcomas, and have become a model for targeted treatment of solid tumours. Imatinib mesilate, which was approved in 2002 for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST, has dramatically changed the course of the disease.\nThis article will focus on the development of imatinib mesilate in the treatment of patients with GIST.\nA Pubmed search was performed using the keywords \u0027imatinib\u0027, \u0027gastrointestinal stromal\u0027, \u0027GIST\u0027, \u0027KIT\u0027 and \u0027PDGFR\u0027. Websites of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical Oncology were searched for data reported in abstract form at recent symposiums. Personal communications from opinion leaders were sought for additional information that might be relevant.\nImatinib has changed the clinical course of patients with advanced GISTs and further development in the adjuvant setting as well as prospective assessment of predictive factors are the current focus of ongoing research.","title":"Imatinib mesilate for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumour.","pubmedId":"18422477"}
