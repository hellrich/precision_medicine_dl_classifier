The cell binding, internalization and degradation of glc-HDL were higher than that in the NP and the NNP.\nThe change of HDL level and lipid deposition during the process may be one of the causes for arteriole spasm in PIH.","title":"[Glycosylated high density lipoprotein in diabetes related to pregnancy induced hypertension].","pubmedId":"9642380"}
