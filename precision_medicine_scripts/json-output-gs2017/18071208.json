The goal of this article was to reveal the frequency of breast cancer among patients with thyroid malignancy; to study the role of thyroid disorders in development of breast cancer; to determine the effectiveness of conservative medical management of thyroid gland after radical surgical treatment of thyroid cancer in prevention of breast cancer. Interaction of breast and thyroid malignancy was studied. As the first stage of scientific investigation the frequency of breast cancer among the patients having thyroid gland malignancy was analyzed; the role of disorders occurred during it in triggering breast cancer was identified; the effectiveness of medical management after radical surgical treatment of thyroid malignancy in preventing breast cancer was determined. Specific hormonal indices and markers of breast cancer among the patients having thyroid gland malignancy were determined. Ultrasound and cytological examinations were performed. The possibilities of prevention breast or thyroid malignancy development were studied. Algorithm of diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in patients with thyroid malignancy were created through systematization of interconnections between both pathologies.","title":"About mechanisms of multiple cancer development.","pubmedId":"18071208"}
