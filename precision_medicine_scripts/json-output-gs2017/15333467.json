In these studies we examined whether VDR status altered mammary gland morphology or transformation in the well-characterized MMTV-neu transgenic model of breast cancer. We demonstrate that VDR protein is highly expressed in neu-positive epithelial cells of preneoplastic lesions, established tumors and lung metastases from MMTV-neu mice. Furthermore, MMTV-neu mice lacking VDR exhibit abnormal mammary ductal morphology characterized by dilated, distended ducts containing dysplastic epithelial cells. From 12 months of age on, MMTV-neu mice lacking VDR also experience body weight loss, atrophy of the mammary fat pad, estrogen deficiency and reduced survival. The limited survival of MMTV-neu mice lacking VDR precluded an accurate assessment of the impact of complete VDR ablation on tumor development. MMTV-neu mice heterozygous for VDR, however, did not exhibit body weight loss, mammary gland atrophy or compromised survival. Compared with MMTV-neu mice with two copies of the VDR gene, haploinsufficiency of VDR shortened the latency and increased the incidence of mammary tumor formation. Tumor histology and expression/subcellular localization of the neu transgene were not altered by VDR haploinsufficiency despite a significant decrease in tumor VDR expression. Collectively, these studies suggest that VDR gene dosage impacts on age-related changes in ductal morphology and oncogene-induced tumorigenesis of the mammary gland in vivo.","title":"Vitamin D receptor status alters mammary gland morphology and tumorigenesis in MMTV-neu mice.","pubmedId":"15333467"}
