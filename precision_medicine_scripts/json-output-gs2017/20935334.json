Recently, immunohistochemistry for ALK has shown sensitivity for the detection of EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma almost equal to that of the fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) assay.\nTo study the clinicopathological features of EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma in a large number of surgically resected samples using immunohistochemistry, in order to establish a useful screening method for EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma.\nImmunohistochemistry for ALK was used to screen for EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinomas in 254 cases of surgically resected samples.\nEML4-ALK-positive cases were detected in 3.1% of lung adenocarcinomas (8/254). EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinomas showed significant associations with intra- and/or extra-cytoplasmic mucin (p\u003d0.0001), and cribriform pattern with excessive extracytoplasmic mucin (p\u003c0.0001). Signet-ring cell appearance alone lacked significance (p\u003d0.149).\nEML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma has a tendency to express a characteristic morphological pattern. The combined use of morphological feature analysis and immunohistochemistry may be a useful and cost effective screening method for EML4-ALK lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Combination of morphological feature analysis and immunohistochemistry is useful for screening of EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20935334"}
