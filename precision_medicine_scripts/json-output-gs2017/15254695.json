It has been recently reported that BRCA1/2 mutations may also predispose to fallopian tube cancer. We report the presence of germline BRCA2 gene mutations in three out of four subjects with fallopian tube cancer diagnosed in a two-year time span at our clinic. The mothers of two of these women suffered from breast or ovarian carcinoma. These results suggest on one hand that in patients with a history suggestive for a heredofamilial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome fallopian tube carcinoma is associated with high risk of BRCA2 mutation, and on the other hand that in patients/individuals with germline BRCA2 gene mutations in whom a prophylactic oophorectomy is performed, removal of fallopian tubes may be considered.","title":"BRCA2 germline mutations in primary cancer of the fallopian tube.","pubmedId":"15254695"}
