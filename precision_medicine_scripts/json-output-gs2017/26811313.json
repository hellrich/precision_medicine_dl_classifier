MET gene amplification has also been associated with hepatic metastases in patients with lung cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hepatic metastases are associated with decreased efficacy of erlotinib in patients with adenocarcinoma.\nA cohort of 329 patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, known EGFR mutation status, and who received treatment with erlotinib in the 2nd or 3rd line setting were enrolled into this study over a period of 4 years between January 2011 and January 2015. The cohort was stratified based on the presence or absence of hepatic metastases and the efficacy of erlotinib was defined based on disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS).\nHepatic metastases were present in 220 of the 329 enrolled lung adenocarcinoma patients. EGFR-activating mutations (exon 19 deletion or an exon 21 L858R mutation) were identified in 113 (34.3%) patients. The DCR was significantly lower in the hepatic metastases group than in patients without hepatic metastases (39.5% vs. 51.4% P\u003d0.045). In patients with hepatic metastases, median PFS was 2.3 months in the EGFR mutation-positive group versus 1.4 months in the EGFR mutation-negative group (95% CI 1.3-3.3 vs. 1.3-1.5; P\u003d0.055). Of note, erlotinib therapy in patients with hepatic metastases was complicated by elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels.\nHepatic metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma predicts poor response to erlotinib as a 2nd/3rd line therapy. Combination therapy, for example with MET-TKI, may be a good choice for patients with liver metastases with poor prognosis.","title":"Hepatic Metastases is Associated with Poor Efficacy of Erlotinib as 2nd/3rd Line Therapy in Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26811313"}
