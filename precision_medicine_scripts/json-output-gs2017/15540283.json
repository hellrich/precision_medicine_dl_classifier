Health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, a consulting firm, and other practice groups provide continuing financial and other support. A database registry, risk-assessment survey, and consent document were developed and then were approved by an institutional review board. A trial enrollment was conducted. Minnesota Colorectal Cancer Initiative services are available to the public. Participants are actively recruited through member organizations. Minnesota Colorectal Cancer Initiative assesses hereditary risk and will document family history in the medical record on request. A personally targeted reply letter reviews risk factors and recommends specific screening and surveillance strategies for participants and their family members, and when appropriate, provides information regarding genetic counseling and testing services. Minnesota Colorectal Cancer Initiative services are free to participants.\nSince 1999, Minnesota Colorectal Cancer Initiative has sent individually tailored reply letters providing risk-specific information about colorectal cancer to 717 participants and more than 3200 of their first-degree and second-degree relatives. More than 200 families, previously unidentified as having histories suggestive of hereditary colorectal cancer (attenuated familial polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), have been identified; genetic services were explained and recommended. A formal program evaluation confirmed that Minnesota Colorectal Cancer Initiative provides useful information and materials and promotes intrafamilial communication about colon cancer risk and recommendations.\nMinnesota Colorectal Cancer Initiative is a model of effective collaboration between academic and community health care providers. A community-based registry is a unique way to identify and provide personal, risk-specific information to large numbers of people at increased or high risk for colorectal cancer.","title":"Minnesota Colorectal Cancer Initiative: successful development and implementation of a community-based colorectal cancer registry.","pubmedId":"15540283"}
