To our knowledge there are only 18 cases of esophageal liposarcoma reported in the English-language literature. Here we report a new case of primary esophageal liposarcoma in a 50-year-old male patient who complained of aggravating dysphagia with intermittent vomiting for 6 months. The tumor was located in the upper esophagus. Polypectomy was performed and histologic examination showed a well-differentiated liposarcoma. Diagnostic and therapeutic tools are discussed and the results of a literature review are discussed.","title":"Primary pedunculated giant esophageal liposarcoma: case report.","pubmedId":"18058173"}
