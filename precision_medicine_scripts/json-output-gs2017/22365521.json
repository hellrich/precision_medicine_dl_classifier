The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of GIST. Although surgery remains the only chance for cure, multimodal treatment that includes molecular therapy continues to develop. Optimal management of GIST requires careful radiographic, pathologic, medical, and surgical care, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach. This review highlights recent developments in the management of GIST.","title":"Updates on the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"22365521"}
