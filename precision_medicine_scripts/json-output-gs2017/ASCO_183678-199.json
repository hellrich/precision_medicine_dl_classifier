Therapeutic responses to IDH inhibitors are infrequent plausibly due to presence of simultaneous alterations activating compensatory molecular pathways. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed results from clinical genomic profiling with targeted next-generation sequencing in two independent data sets of archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples (Ion Torrent \u003c 50 genes, 300; FoundationOne \u003c 343 genes, 30; Oncomine 128 genes, 4) and plasma liquid biopsies (Guardant360 \u003c 73 genes panel, 337 samples) from patients with solid tumors of all stages. Results: In 334 FFPE samples the most represented cancers were gliomas (50%), melanomas (14%), cholangiocarcinomas (11%), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, 6%). In 296 IDH1-mutated FFPE samples the most frequent simultaneous alterations were in TP53 (45%), BRAF (11%), KRAS (9%), and PIK3CA (26, 9%). In the most represented IDH1-mutated tumor types commonly altered genes were TP53 (66%) in gliomas, BRAF (53% [V600K/R 30%, V600E 19%]) in melanomas, PIK3CA (13%), CDKN2A (13%) in cholangiocarcinomas and KRAS (65%) in NSCLC. In 38 IDH2-mutated FFPE samples the most frequent simultaneous alterations were in TP53 (32%), and KRAS (16%). In 337 plasma samples the most represented cancers were NSCLC (39%), cholangiocarcinoma (13%), and breast cancer (8%). In 172 IDH1-mutated plasma samples the most frequent simultaneous alterations were in TP53 (40%), KRAS (23%), EGFR (16%) and BRAF (16%). In the most represented IDH1-mutated tumors commonly altered genes were TP53 (48%), KRAS (37%) in NSCLC and TP53 (37%), KRAS (24%), BRAF (18%) in cholangiocarcinoma. In 161 IDH2-mutated plasma samples the most frequent simultaneous alterations were in TP53 (43%), EGFR (20%), and KRAS (19%). In the most represented IDH2-mutated tumors commonly altered genes were TP53 (43%), EGFR (32%), KRAS (18%) in NSCLC and TP53 (18%), ESR1 (18%), KRAS (18%) in breast cancer. There were 4 tumors with IDH1 and IDH2mutations. Conclusions:IDH1 and IDH2 mutations often coexist with simultaneous oncogenic alterations including these in potentially druggable molecular targets.","title":"Simultaneous molecular alterations in solid tumors with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations.","pubmedId":"ASCO_183678-199"}
