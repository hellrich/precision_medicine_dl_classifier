Pooled individually data were examined for clinical outcomes after second pancreatectomy for recurrent PDAC.\nA total of 19 articles involving 55 patients were eligible for inclusion. The median disease-free interval after initial resection was 33 (range 7-143) months. Of the 55 patients reported, 52 (94.5%) patients underwent completion total pancreatectomy in the second operation for recurrences, including 15 patients who developed recurrences more than 5 years after the initial operation. There was no perioperative death. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rate after the second pancreatectomy was 82.2%, 49.2% and 40.6% respectively.\nSecond pancreatectomy for recurrent PDAC can be performed safely with long-term survival in selected patients.","title":"Second pancreatectomy for recurrent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the remnant pancreas: A pooled analysis.","pubmedId":"27717684"}
