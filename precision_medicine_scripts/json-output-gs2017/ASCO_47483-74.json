Gefitinib has demonstrated clinical benefit in pts with NSCLC harboring mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This phase II study aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of gefitinib as first-line treatment for elderly pts with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutations. Methods: Chemotherapy-nave advanced lung adenocarcinoma pts aged 75 years or older who had EGFR mutations (exon 19 del or L858R) were enrolled and received daily doses of 250mg of gefitinib. The primary endpoint was response rate (RR). Secondary endpoints were toxicity, disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). This study required 12 cases as sample size to show its efficacy exceeding the lower limit of interest 30% with alpha \u003d 0.05 (one side) and beta \u003d 0.1. Results: From April 2008 to November 2009, 15 lung adenocarcinoma pts were enrolled (median age: 79, female/male: 10/5, PS 0/1/2: 4/8/3, stage IIIB/IV: 2/13, never smoker/smoker: 9/6, exon 19 del/L858R: 6/9). Overall response rate was 60% (95%CI: 36.0-80.9%) and DCR was 87% (95%CI: 63.7-97.6%) (CR/PR/SD/PD: 2/7/4/2). Grade 3 skin rash and liver toxicity occurred in 2 patients, respectively, but none experienced lung toxicities. Median PFS was 10.4 months (95% CI: 7.2-13.6) and median OS has not been attained yet. Conclusions: First-line gefitinib was effective for and tolerated by elderly patients with EGFR mutations. Gefitinib can be recommended for this population as a standard treatment.","title":"First-line gefitinib for elderly patients harboring EGFR mutations.","pubmedId":"ASCO_47483-74"}
