Additional references were identified from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles.\nColorectal cancer is the third most common non-skin cancer in women, after breast and lung cancers. Many women underestimate their risk of colorectal cancer, which may lead them to underuse screening measures that have been proven to reduce disease morbidity and mortality. For average-risk women and men \u003e or \u003d 50 years of age, pharmacists should recommend regular screening for early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. In its earliest, most curable stages, colorectal cancer is often asymptomatic. However, patients who report signs and symptoms, such as blood in the stool, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, unexplained weight loss, or iron deficiency anemia, should be referred for medical evaluation. The use of chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormone replacement therapy, and dietary calcium, holds significant promise, but further studies are needed before these agents can be recommended for cancer prevention in the general population. Surgical resection is the primary treatment modality for colorectal cancer, and adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in patients with stage III disease and some high-risk patients with stage II disease. Pharmacists should be aware that women are more susceptible to dose-related toxicity effects of fluorouracil and leucovorin combination chemotherapy, the first-line regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy.\nAlthough often perceived as a disease that primarily affects men, colorectal cancer is an equally important health concern for women. By providing education and counseling, pharmacists can help raise women\u0027s awareness of this disease and encourage them to take steps to significantly reduce their risk.","title":"Prevention and management of colorectal cancer in women.","pubmedId":"11486985"}
