We further determined the serum levels of sCD44, sCD44v6, neopterin and IL-2R. Except Cyclin D none of the immunohistochemically determined factors had prognostic significance. Interestingly all of the immunological serum parameters were of high prognostic significance. These data demonstrate the prognostic relevance of immunological parameters in human adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and could raise the possibility of an early immunological intervention in pancreatic cancer.","title":"[Prognostic value of molecular biologogy and immunologic parameters in human pancreatic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"14518215"}
