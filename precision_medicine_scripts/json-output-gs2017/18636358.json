The NDRG2 mRNA level was detected by semi-quantitive RT-PCR and the NDRG2 protein level was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry.\nTwelve samples of colon cancer tissues had low NDRG2 mRNA level and low protein level. The positive rates of NDRG2 in normal tissues and the tumorous colon tissues were 90.0%(27/30) and 53.3%(16/30) by immunohistochemistry respectively. There was a significant difference between two groups (P\u003c0.05). The NDRG2 expression was not correlated with age, sex, metastasis of lymph node, depth of infiltration, as well as the Dukes staging(P\u003e0.05), while it was correlated to the histology grading. The positive rate of NDRG2 in the well- and moderate-differentiation group was higher than that in the poor-differentiation group(P\u003c0.05).\nThe expression of NDRG2 is low in some colon cancer tissues, which indicates that the low level of NDRG2 expression may be engaged in the development of colon cancer.","title":"[Expression of candidate tumor suppressor gene N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2 in colon cancer].","pubmedId":"18636358"}
