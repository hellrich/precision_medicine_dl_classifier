Whether this relation is casual or causal, it would seem that the importance of their possible relationship is twofold. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical features of lung cancer associated with several CTDs. Patients with CTD associated with lung cancer were retrospectively evaluated. A review of the clinical features of 153 reported cases from 1944 to the present was conducted. There were 82 females and 71 males, with a median age of 58. Histological types of lung cancer were as follows, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma (39 cases), adenocarcinoma (36), squamous cell carcinoma (28), small cell lung cancer (27), large cell carcinoma (6), others (8), and unknown (10). There was a relationship between smoking and development of lung cancer in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM). The majority of patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) who developed lung cancer were female, with underlying interstitial fibrosis, and most tumors were of bronchioloalveolar cell or adenocarcinoma cell type. Patient characteristics were significantly different among the various groups of CTD associated with lung cancer.","title":"Lung cancer associated with several connective tissue diseases: with a review of literature.","pubmedId":"11765223"}
