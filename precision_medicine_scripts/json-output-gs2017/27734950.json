Surgically excised tumor, bronchoscopy biopsy/brushing specimens and pleural effusions were prospectively collected from 1029 patients. PIK3CA and EGFR mutations were analyzed by RT-PCR and direct sequencing. In EGFR TKI-nave specimens, PIK3CA mutation rate was 1.8% (14/760). Twelve patients had coexisting PIK3CA and EGFR mutations. Among the 344 EGFR TKI-treated EGFR mutant patients, there was no significant difference in treatment response (p \u003d 0.476) and progression-free survival (p \u003d 0.401) of EGFR TKI between PIK3CA mutation-positive and negative patients. The PIK3CA mutation rate in lung adenocarcinoma with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI is not higher than that in EGFR TKI-naïve tissue specimens (2.9% (6/207) vs. 1.8%; p \u003d 0.344). Of the 74 patients with paired specimens (TKI-naïve and acquired resistance to TKIs) only one patient (1.4%) developed acquired PIK3CA (E545K) mutation, and he also had acquired EGFR (T790M) mutation. In conclusion, PIK3CA mutation may not be associated with primary resistance to EGFR TKI among lung adenocarcinoma patients. Acquired PIK3CA mutation related to EGFR TKI treatment is rare.","title":"The Role of PIK3CA Mutations among Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients with Primary and Acquired Resistance to EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition.","pubmedId":"27734950"}
