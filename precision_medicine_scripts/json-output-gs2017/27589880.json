In one study, breast carcinoma accounted for 0.02% of breast masses surgically removed in young women. We report a case of breast cancer in a 19-year-old woman who was found to have Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.\nThe patient presented with a new, hard, nonmobile lump in the right breast which prompted her to seek medical attention. A biopsy identified invasive ductal carcinoma. Genetic testing showed a p53 mutation associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.\nAlthough breast masses in young women are mostly benign, one must entertain the possibility of more serious conditions when a breast mass is identified with concerning medical or physical findings. Genetic testing might be informative for such patients.","title":"Breast Cancer in a 19-Year-Old Female Adolescent Identified with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.","pubmedId":"27589880"}
