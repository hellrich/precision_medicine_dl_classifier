In this model system for human B-cell neoplasia, one of the BALB/c susceptibility and modifier loci, Pctr1, was mapped to a 5.7-centimorgan (cM) chromosomal region that included Cdkn2a, which encodes p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF), and the coding sequences for the BALB/c p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) alleles were found to be polymorphic with respect to their resistant Pctr1 counterparts in DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice (45). In the present study, alleles of Pctr1, Cdkn2a, and D4Mit15 from a resistant strain (BALB/cDAG) carrying DBA/2 chromatin were introgressively backcrossed to the susceptible BALB/c strain. The resultant C.DAG-Pctr1 Cdkn2a D4Mit15 congenic was more resistant to plasmacytomagenesis than BALB/c, thus narrowing Pctr1 to a 1.5-cM interval. Concomitantly, resistant C57BL/6 mice, from which both gene products of the Cdkn2a gene have been eliminated, developed pristane-induced plasma cell tumors over a shorter latency period than the traditionally susceptible BALB/cAn strain. Biological assays of the p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) alleles from BALB/c and DBA/2 indicated that the BALB/c p16(INK4a) allele was less active than its DBA/2 counterpart in inducing growth arrest of mouse plasmacytoma cell lines and preventing ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, while the two p19(ARF) alleles displayed similar potencies in both assays. We propose that the BALB/c susceptibility/modifier locus, Pctr1, is an \"efficiency\" allele of the p16(INK4a) gene.","title":"Efficiency alleles of the Pctr1 modifier locus for plasmacytoma susceptibility.","pubmedId":"11113205"}
