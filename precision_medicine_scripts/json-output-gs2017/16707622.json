The risk for developing cancer at ages 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 years was 2%, 5%, 17%, 31%, 60%, and 85%, respectively. The most common cancers represented in this analysis were gastrointestinal in origin, gastroesophageal, small bowel, colorectal, and pancreatic, and the risk for these cancers at ages 30, 40, 50, and 60 years was 1%, 9%, 15%, and 33%, respectively. In women with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, the risk of breast cancer was substantially increased, being 8% and 31% at ages 40 and 60 years, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that cancer risks were similar in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients with identified STK11/LKB1 mutations and those with no detectable mutation (log-rank test of difference chi2 \u003d 0.62; 1 df; P \u003d 0.43). Furthermore, the type or site of STK11/LKB1 mutation did not significantly influence cancer risk.\nThe results from our study provide quantitative information on the spectrum of cancers and risks of specific cancer types associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","title":"Frequency and spectrum of cancers in the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","pubmedId":"16707622"}
