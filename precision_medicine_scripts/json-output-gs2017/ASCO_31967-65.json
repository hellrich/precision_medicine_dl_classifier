Gender differences have been reported, most of them based on retrospective analysis. Methods: WORLD07 is a prospective, multicenter, epidemiologic female-specific lung cancer database developed by the Spanish Lung Cancer Group. Data on demographics, previous cancer history, reproductive and hormonal status, diet, alcohol, tobacco, and occupational information are being collected just as histology, stage, treatment and survival. Results: From October 2007 to Nov 2008, 342 female newly diagnosed of lung cancer were collected in an e-database in 20 Spanish centers. Patients (p) characteristics are: median age 61.7 years (y) (range: 36 - 87); Caucasian: 98.2%; Marital status (%): married 67.7, unmarried 11.2, divorced 7.1, widow 14. Educational level (%): basic 57.4, secondary 29.1, university 13.5. Median age of menarche 12.7 y. Children: 79.4% (median: 2); Median age of first child 27 y. Oral contraceptive: 30.6%. Pre-menopausal 15.4%,postmenopausal 84.6%. Median age of menopause 46.7 y. HRT: 5.3%. Median duration of HRT: 4.4 y. Obesity: 11.3%. Smoking habit (%): never (passive smoker/no exposition)/former/current smokers: 42 (42.8/57.2) /19 /39; Median packs/year 72.4. Former smokers: 1-5/5-10/10-15/\u003e15 y (%): 51/11.8/7.8/29.4. Work exposure 3.5%. Alcohol consumption 3.2%. Familial history of cancer: 45.5% (lung cancer 29.7%). Previous history of cancer 13.8% (breast 33.3%). Current lung cancer histology (%): adenocarcinoma/BAC/squamous/large cell/NOS: 70.4/5.7/10.4/7.9/5.7. SCLC 11.8%. TNM I/II/III/IV (%): 16/3.9/28.7/51.4. Surgical treatment 24.7 % (lobectomy/pneumonectomy/exploratory: 85.5/9.2/5.3%). Available data of 122 stage IV NSCLC p: 74.6% receive chemotherapy, 92.3% of them two drugs and 68.9 % platinum-based (59% cisplatin). EGFR mutations analysis 7.9%. Conclusions: According this series, 42% of Spanish lung cancer women are never smokers and 70.4% have adenocarcinoma. Other collected information, choice of treatment and survival outcomes will be also analyzed.","title":"Lung cancer in women: The Spanish female-specific database WORLD 07.","pubmedId":"ASCO_31967-65"}
