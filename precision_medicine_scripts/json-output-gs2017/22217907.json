Pylorus preserving pancreatico-duodenectomy (PPPD) was performed in 42 cases, a classic Whipple procedure (WP) in 38, distal resection in 6 and total pancreatectomy in 6 patients. Median size of the tumours was 3 cm R(0) resection was obtained in 54 patients. Lymph node metastases were found in 64 patients. 20% experienced postoperative intra-abdominal complications, and 30 days postoperative mortality was 4%. A routine use of somatostatine analogues postoperatively did not reduce the frequency of leakage. Two years survival was 34.6% and 5 years 11.8%, respectively.\nPatients with ductal adenocarcinomas can be offered potential curative resections with acceptable rates of complication and mortality. Preoperative biliary stenting is still controversial and prophylactic octreotide should be used whenever the anastomosis is considered challenged and in cases of a soft pancreatic remnant. Five years all over survival has improved over the last decade from \u003c5% to \u003e11%.","title":"Improving survival following surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma--a ten-year experience.","pubmedId":"22217907"}
