The development of endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency served as early markers for neoplastic transformation. Screening endoscopic ultrasound and ERCP showed abnormalities suggestive of pancreatic dysplasia. Total pancreatectomy was performed and pathology confirmed carcinoma in situ, also known as high-grade pancreatic ductal dysplasia or Pan IN-3. The patient\u0027s post-operative course was complicated by life threatening, brittle diabetes. Pancreas transplantation was successfully performed. One year following transplantation, the patient has excellent pancreas graft function. He remains insulin free and has no signs of malignancy. Total pancreatectomy followed by pancreas transplantation is a viable therapeutic option for patients in the dysplastic but still pre-malignant phase of familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma who develop hypoglycemic unawareness following total pancreatectomy.","title":"A new indication for pancreas transplantation: high grade pancreatic dysplasia.","pubmedId":"15108779"}
