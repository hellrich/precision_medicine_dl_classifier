We report a case of liposarcoma of the vulva which was treated with local excision and postoperative radiotherapy.\nA 21-year-old woman complained of a painless lump in her labium majus which she first noticed 3 years earlier. An initial diagnosis of lipoma of the vulva was made. The patient was treated by surgical removal. On examination of the surgical specimen, the final pathological diagnosis was well-differentiated liposarcoma and the stalk was not excised completely. Radiotherapy was initiated because of the uncertainty of the patient\u0027s prognosis. Eighteen months after radiotherapy, no evidence of local recurrence, metastasis, and late complication has been seen.\nThis case is suggestive of the contribution of postoperative radiotherapy, although not conclusive, and continued monitoring is necessary because recurrence or metastasis can occur years later.","title":"Radiotherapy for liposarcoma of the vulva.","pubmedId":"11063664"}
