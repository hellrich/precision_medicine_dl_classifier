There are less than a hundred cases reported in the English literature. Most of these have been diagnosed after surgery for a renal neoplasm diagnosed on imaging. PNET has rarely been reported as a second malignancy, and has never been reported as a second malignancy after non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present our case of a 38-year-old female who developed a second malignancy in the kidney after the treatment for NHL.
