Participants provided blood for DNA analysis and cancer family history, and cancer treatment records were reviewed. DNA from all patients was analyzed by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.\nThree hundred six patients were eligible for analysis. Pathogenic germline BRCA mutations were identified in 14 patients (4.6%; 95% CI, 2.2% to 6.9%), including 11 patients with a BRCA2 mutation and three patients with a BRCA1 mutation. Having a cancer family history that met genetic testing criteria of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network or the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care or self-reporting as Ashkenazi Jewish was significantly associated with BRCA mutation carrier status (P\u003d.02, P\u003c.001, and P\u003d.05, respectively). However, the majority of the BRCA mutation-positive patients did not actually meet these genetic testing criteria.\nPathogenic BRCA mutations were identified in 4.6% of a large cohort of clinic-based patients. Considering the implications for family members of BRCA carriers, and possibly tailored chemotherapeutic treatment of patients, our finding has implications for broader BRCA genetic testing for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","title":"Germline BRCA Mutations in a Large Clinic-Based Cohort of Patients With Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25940717"}
