It has been associated with cocaine exposure, sickle cell anemia, anticoagulant therapy, neoplastic syndromes, diabetes, and the use of psychotropic medications. Androstenedione is a testosterone precursor used by athletes to enhance performance; the lay press has recently touted this substance as an over-the-counter sexual stimulant. We describe an otherwise healthy man with 2 episodes of priapism after the use of androstenedione. The patient did not have any factors known to precipitate priapism.","title":"Priapism after androstenedione intake for athletic performance enhancement.","pubmedId":"10736127"}
