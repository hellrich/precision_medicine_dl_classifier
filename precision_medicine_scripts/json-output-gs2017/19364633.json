This 16-item questionnaire is the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Pain (FACT-BP). We also developed a 13/18-item questionnaire, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Treatment Satisfaction-Bone Treatment Convenience and Satisfaction Questionnaire (FACIT-TS-BTCSQ), to evaluate patients\u0027 expectations and acceptance of bone-specific therapies. We evaluated the performance of these scales in two clinical trials. In both trials, we enrolled patients with metastatic breast cancer, who had progressive bone metastases despite first-line therapy with pamidronate or clodronate. We administered intravenous zoledronic acid to 31 patients in one trial and oral ibandronate to 30 patients in the other. Patients completed the FACT-BP questionnaire and FACIT-TS-BTCSQ at baseline, then at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. The FACT-BP scale showed good internal consistency reliability [Cronbach\u0027s alpha (alpha)\u003d0.93-0.96]. There was evidence of construct validity, and known-group validity was supported by score shifts in the anticipated direction (Cohen\u0027s d effect size\u003d0.36). The FACT-BP score reflected clinical change as evidenced by differences in performance status. This cross-sectional anchor-based criterion suggested reasonable clinically important differences (effect size\u003d0.36). The FACIT-TS-BTCSQ showed good internal consistency reliability for treatment expectation (alpha\u003d0.87) and treatment experience (alpha\u0027s\u003d0.89-0.92). The FACT-BP scale is meaningful and appears appropriate for broader use. The assessment of satisfaction (FACIT-TS-BTCSQ) raised questions that will require further research.","title":"Switching breast cancer patients with progressive bone metastases to third-generation bisphosphonates: measuring impact using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Pain.","pubmedId":"19364633"}
