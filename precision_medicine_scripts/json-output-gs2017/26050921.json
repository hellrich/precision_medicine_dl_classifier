As the number of patients with a preserved fertility wish has increased, the need for fertility sparing surgery emerges. In this study we discuss 11 patients with cervical carcinoma stage IB treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by large cone resection.\nIn this retrospective study we included 10 patients with FIGO stage IB1 and 1 patient with IB2 cervical cancer, who first received a pelvic lymphadenectomy followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy and conization. Paclitaxel-ifosfamide-carboplatin or a combination of paclitaxel-carboplatin was used as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nComplete response after chemotherapy was observed in 64%, partial response in 27% and 9% had progressive disease. All patients with response underwent a conization, with no residual disease on pathology in 80%. Patients with residual disease were treated by radical hysterectomy. In 9 patients fertility sparing surgery could be performed and 6 (67%) got pregnant. Five patients had 7 children and two patients had four missed abortions. Two premature deliveries at 32 and 33weeks were described, both in the same patient. Recurrence was observed in one patient that was treated with simple hysterectomy followed by radiochemotherapy. Median follow up time is 58months with all patients alive and no evidence of disease until now.\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by conization seems to be a promising new fertility sparing treatment modality in patients with cervical carcinoma stage IB1, but further studies with larger populations should confirm these data.","title":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by large cone resection as fertility-sparing therapy in stage IB cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"26050921"}
