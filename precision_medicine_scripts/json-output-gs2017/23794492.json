Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) with the EML4-ALK fusion gene has been described as demonstrating mucinous cribriform/acinar growth and signet-ring cells, sometimes partially simulating SQCC. We investigated the relation among morphology, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, and immunophenotype in 321 ADCs by tissue microarray using SQCC markers cytokeratin (CK)5/6, CK14, desmocollin-3, desmoglein-3, p40, p63 versus ADC markers thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1 and napsin A. Unlike 312 ALK-negative ADCs, 9 ALK-positive cases were negative for 4 SQCC markers. Only 1 ALK-positive ADC showing assertive morphology was positive for CK5/6 and p63 as well as for TTF-1 and napsin A. Coexpression of TTF-1/p40 was not observed, unlike that of TTF-1/p63 reported previously. There was no statistically significant difference between ALK-negative and ALK-positive ADC by immunohistochemical profiling.
