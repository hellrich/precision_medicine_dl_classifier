We hypothesize that these diagnostic markers do not predict relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) in the critically ill or injured patient.\nChart review of surgical, trauma, and medical patients admitted over 7 years to a critical care unit was performed to evaluate cortisol levels drawn for suspicion of RAI, which was defined as a cortisol concentration \u003c25 mcg/dl. Laboratory parameters were defined as hyponatremia \u003c135 mmol/l, hyperkalemia \u003e5.3 mmol/l, hypercalcemia \u003e2.55 mmol/l (10.2 mg/dl), hypoglycemia \u003c3.89 mmol/l (70 mg/dl), and eosinophilia \u003e5%.\nA total of 212 patients had cortisol levels drawn. Fifty-seven percent were male and their mean age was 59 years. Fifty-three percent had RAI. Average cortisol level was 30.5 Î¼g/dl. No significant differences were seen in mean potassium, sodium, calcium, or glucose levels between RAI and non-RAI patients. Few patients had laboratory values consistent with RAI. In fact, many with RAI had opposite findings: 75% had hypernatremia, 90% had hypokalemia, 100% had hypocalcemia, and 97% had hyperglycemia. Eosinophilia was statistically significant (P \u003d 0.026).\nHyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and hypoglycemia do not predominate in RAI and laboratory values are of minimal value in predicting patients with RAI.","title":"Relative adrenal insufficiency in the critical care setting: debunking the classic myth.","pubmedId":"21533963"}
