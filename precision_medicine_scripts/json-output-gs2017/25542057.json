Eligible patients had advanced melanoma and could have received up to two previous lines of treatment for metastatic disease.\n15 patients were enrolled, all but one of whose melanoma was wild type for BRAF at codon 600. The maximal monotherapy dose of trametinib proved tolerable with weekly paclitaxel. The most frequent adverse events observed were rash and fatigue. Six (40%) partial responses were reported, including four of eight patients with NRAS mutations. Median progression free survival was 5.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-7.8 months) and overall survival, 14.1 months (95% CI 4.6-not reached).\nTrametinib can safely be given with weekly paclitaxel at the full monotherapy dose. In this small group promising progression free and overall survival were observed in patients with melanoma lacking a V600 BRAF mutation.","title":"PACMEL: a phase 1 dose escalation trial of trametinib (GSK1120212) in combination with paclitaxel.","pubmedId":"25542057"}
