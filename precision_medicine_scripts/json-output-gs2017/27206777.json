We describe the case of a 32-year-old female who presented with increasing shortness of breath. Radiological investigations revealed severe emphysema with hyperexpansion of the right lung and a mediastinal shift to the left. A lung perfusion scan showed reduced perfusion in the right lung. The patient underwent a right pneumonectomy with a diagnosis of congenital bullous emphysema. She was doing well 6 years later.
