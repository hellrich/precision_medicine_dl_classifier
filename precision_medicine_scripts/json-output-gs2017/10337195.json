Many patients die with this tumour. It is the cancer whose incidence increases the most among all the tumours (double every 10 years). The pronostic of melanoma is very bad at metastatic stage. On the contrary, the excision of tumour at an early stage may be associated to a complete remission. So it is important to encourage skin cancer detection for an early treatment of melanoma. Finally, it appears crucial to increase the diffusion of informations about the photoprotection. Indeed, solar exposition probably plays on important role in the increasing incidence fo this skin tumour.","title":"[Melanoma].","pubmedId":"10337195"}
