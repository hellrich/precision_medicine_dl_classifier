We report a 12-year-old girl with an atypical primary optic nerve meningioma, which demonstrated restricted diffusion on magnetic resonance imaging and high Ki67 labeling index. The patient developed recurrence, despite aggressive surgical resection of primary tumor and local radiation. We are unaware of previous reports documenting this constellation of imaging and histopathologic findings.","title":"Primary atypical optic nerve sheath meningioma in a child with restricted diffusion on magnetic resonance imaging.","pubmedId":"24705258"}
