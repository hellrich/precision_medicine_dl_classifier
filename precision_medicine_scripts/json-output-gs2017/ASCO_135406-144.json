PTEN loss and PI3K activation are common in BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma, and PI3K activation has been implicated as a cause acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.  This phase I study tested the safety of combining the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, with the PI3K inhibitor, BKM120, in patients with metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma.    Methods:   Vemurafenib-nave patients receive a single dose of oral BKM120 (d -7) then vemurafenib twice daily with BKM120 daily (starting on c1d1). Patients with prior progression on vemurafenib received both vemurafenib and BKM120 starting on c1d1 after a vemurafenib washout of at least 14 days. Serial biopsies prior to treatment, on cycle 1 day 15, and at progression were obtained for pharmacodynamics analysis in patients with visible or palpable tumors.   3 + 3 dose escalation was planned starting at vemurafenib 720 mg PO twice daily with BKM120 60 mg daily.  Results:   Four BRAF inhibitor nave patients andfour BRAF inhibitor refractory patients were treated on study with vemurafenib 720 mg PO bid and BKM120 60 mg PO daily.  Two BRAF inhibitor nave patient experienced DLTs (myalgias, DRESS syndrome).  One vemurafenib nave patient was inevaluable due to non-compliance and had minimal exposure to study drug. Two of four BRAF inhibitor refractory patients experienced DLTs (myalgias, febrile neutropenia). One BRAF inhibitor-resistant patient had a mixed response to treatment with a 35.9% reduction in target lesions and two new small subcutaneous lesions.  Conclusions:   Combination therapy with vemurafenib and BKM120 in BRAF-V600E/K mutant melanoma was not tolerated in either BRAF inhibitor nave or BRAF inhibitor resistant patients.
