We aimed to assess whether the tumor suppressor gene BRCA2 was the inactivation target for allelic loss observed on chromosome 13q in ESCC.\nWe examined the entire coding sequence of the BRCA2 gene for mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing in 56 ESCC patients from Shanxi, China.\nEight mutations were identified in 5 patients (9%), including 3 with germ-line mutations and 2 with only somatic mutations. However, all but 1 of the mutations were missense or silent changes and of unknown significance. Evidence for potential biallelic inactivation was seen in only 4 (7%) cases.\nBRCA2 mutations occur in ESCC but are infrequent and of unknown consequence. The putative target tumor suppressor gene corresponding to the high rate of chromosome 13q allelic loss remains unknown.","title":"Infrequent mutation in the BRCA2 gene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11948123"}
