This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between VDR TaqI (rs731236), BsmI (rs1544410) and ApaI (rs7975232) gene polymorphism and the risk of lung cancer using meta-analysis method. The association studies were identified from PubMed and Cochrane Library on 1 December 2013, and eligible investigations were included and synthesized using meta-analysis method. Six reports were recruited into this meta-analysis for the association of VDR gene polymorphism with lung cancer susceptibility. In the meta-analysis for ApaI gene polymorphism, AA genotype was associated with the risk of lung cancer in Asians. In the meta-analysis for BsmI gene polymorphism, B allele, BB genotype and bb genotype were associated with lung cancer in Asians, and B allele bb genotype were associated with lung cancer risk in overall populations; furthermore, bb genotype was associated with lung cancer risk in Caucasians. In the meta-analysis for TaqI gene polymorphism, t allele and TT genotype were associated with lung cancer in overall populations and in Caucasians. In conclusion, B allele bb genotype t allele and TT genotype were associated with lung cancer risk in overall populations. AA genotype, B allele, BB genotype and bb genotype were associated with the risk of lung cancer in Asians. Furthermore, bb genotype t allele and TT genotype was associated with lung cancer risk in Caucasians. However, more studies should be conducted to confirm it.","title":"Association of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism with the risk of lung cancer: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"24875270"}
