The aim of this study is to determine ErbB2 and ErbB3 expression in NSCLC.  Methods:  Tumor samples from 126 NSCLC pts who underwent complete resection in our institution from October 2007 to September 2010 were analyzed. Tissue microarrays were used to study ErbB2 and ErbB3 expression by immunohistochemistry; expression was graded by two independent observers and tumors with a 2+/3+ score were classified as high expression. ErbB2 by FISH was analyzed in pts with high ErbB2 expression. EGFR-mutation (mut) status was determined in selected pts.  Results:  Pts characteristics: median age 67 yrs, 81% male, 6% never smokers, 40% adenocarcinoma (ADC)/ 39% squamous-cell (SCC)/ 21% others, p-stage 33% I/28% II/30% III/9% IV. High ErbB2 expression was found in 5 (4%) pts: all 5 male, 1 never smoker, 3 ADC/2 SCC.  None of these pts was ErbB2 FISH+. High ErbB3 membranous and cytoplasmic expression was found in 27% and 21% of samples, respectively, with 10% of samples having high expression at both sites. No correlation was found between ErbB3 expression and age and p-stage. High ErbB3 expression was more frequent in females than in males (membranous 46% vs 22% p\u003d .038; cytoplasmic 33% vs 18% p\u003d .099, respectively), in ADC than in the other histologies (membranous 36% vs 21% p\u003d .07; cytoplasmic 32% vs 13% p \u003d.014, respectively). Five of 23 pts had EGFR-mut (2 del exon 19, 3 L858R exon 21): all 5 female with ADC, 4 never smokers. No EGFR-mut pt had concomitant high ErbB2. Four EGFR-mut pts had high cytoplasmic ErbB3 expression (80%), 3 (60%) had membranous expression. Preliminary results (median follow-up, 17 months) showed no association between ErbB3 expression and disease-free or overall survival, although longer follow-up is needed.  Conclusions:  High ErbB2 expression is infrequent in NSCLC. ErbB3 can be highly expressed in NSCLC and seems more frequent in females, ADC and EGFR-mut tumors. ErbB3 warrants further study in NSCLC to clarify its role and its potential use as therapeutic target.","title":"Expression of ErbB2 and ErbB3 in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (pts).","pubmedId":"ASCO_80580-102"}
