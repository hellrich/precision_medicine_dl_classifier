The authors describe eight families with the FAMMM-pancreatic carcinoma (FAMMM-PC) association in concert with a CDKN2A germline mutation. Each family was thoroughly educated about all facets of the study, including the molecular genetics, reduced penetrance of CDKN2A mutations, and their variable expressivity. Genetic counseling was provided to each patient.\nDiversity in cancer presentation within and among the families was noteworthy, wherein melanoma predominated in certain of the families whereas pancreatic carcinoma predominated in others. Early-onset pancreatic carcinoma (at ages 35, 45, 46, and 49 years) appeared in some of the families whereas markedly later-onset pancreatic carcinoma occurred in others. There were four incidences of melanoma and pancreatic carcinoma as double primaries in the same individuals. One patient with melanoma and pancreatic carcinoma had a third primary of breast carcinoma. Another patient had sarcoma, esophageal carcinoma, and two melanoma primaries, whereas his daughter had sarcoma and was a carrier of a CDKN2A mutation.\nThe authors suggest that these tumors may collectively, in concert with CDKN2A mutations, constitute a \"new\" putative hereditary carcinoma syndrome referred to as FAMMM-PC. More clinical and molecular genetic research on additional families with pancreatic carcinoma in concert with the FAMMM will be required.","title":"Phenotypic variation in eight extended CDKN2A germline mutation familial atypical multiple mole melanoma-pancreatic carcinoma-prone families: the familial atypical mole melanoma-pancreatic carcinoma syndrome.","pubmedId":"11815963"}
