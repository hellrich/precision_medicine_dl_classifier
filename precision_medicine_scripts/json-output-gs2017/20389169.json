In this study, we analyzed the differences in gene expression profiles between cryptorchid and descended testes. In particular, we analyzed expression of all recently published genes known to be associated with undescended testis.\nTwenty-two testicular biopsies from 18 boys were analyzed. We analyzed gene expression in 16 cryptorchid and 6 descended testes using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, and validated the results with qPCR.\n3,688 transcripts were differentially expressed with an adjusted p value of \u003c0.05 and a change of at least 1.5-fold. The list contained 1,866 downregulated and 1,822 upregulated transcripts in the cryptorchid testes. A novel observation in our study was that the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFR1) and its mediators SOS1 and RAF1 were expressed less in undescended testes.\nBased on our results, it is possible that a subtle dysfunction (expression) of the FGFR1, SOS1 and RAF1 genes is involved in the development of the most common male reproductive tract disorder - unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism.","title":"Decreased expression of FGFR1, SOS1, RAF1 genes in cryptorchidism.","pubmedId":"20389169"}
