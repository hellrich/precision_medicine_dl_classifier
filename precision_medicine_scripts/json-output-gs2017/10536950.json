Survival for patients with stage I lung cancer and lesions less than 2 cm is comparable to that of major resections such as lobectomy. The theoretical advantage of limited resection is the simplicity of the procedure and the potential for performing it through lesser invasive techniques. The major drawback at this time which should render it a compromise rather than a choice operation is the increased risk of locoregional recurrence. Until properly conducted clinical trials validate its efficacy in peripheral T1 lung cancer with or without adjuvent therapy, sublobar resection should be limited to patients that are at poor risk of tolerating major lung resection. Sublobar resections however may also play a useful role in treatment of metachronous or synchronous lung cancer.","title":"Sublobar resection for lung cancer.","pubmedId":"10536950"}
