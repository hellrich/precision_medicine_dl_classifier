A subset of these patients (5-10%) report a familial history of the disease. The genetic etiology in these familial cases is poorly defined, with known susceptibility genes, such as: BRCA2, PALB2, CDKN2A, BRCA1, PRSS1 and STK11, accounting for only 10-15% of familial pancreatic cancer. In an effort to identify previously unappreciated pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes, we used next generation sequencing technology to evaluate the whole genome and whole exome sequences of 16 (6 families) and 22 individuals (10 families) respectively. All of these families enrolled into one of the familial pancreatic cancer registries participating in the Pancreatic Cancer Genetic Epidemiology (PacGene) Consortium, all had at least three members with PDA, and DNA was available from at least two affected members in each kindred. Using this approach, we identified heterozygous, inactivating, ATM mutations in two kindreds with familial pancreatic cancer (c.8266A\u003eAT; p.K2756X and c.170G\u003eGA; p.W57X). These mutations were previously reported as disease causing variants in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia, an autosomal recessive condition resulting from bi-allelic deleterious mutations of ATM. Interestingly, heterozygotes of deleterious ATM mutations have an increased risk of breast cancer. However, there have been no previous reports of deleterious ATM mutations in the germline of familial PDA patients. In our study, mutations segregated with disease in both kindreds and tumor analysis demonstrated Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele. Sequence analysis of the entire ATM gene in an additional 166 familial pancreatic cancer probands indentified four additional patients with deleterious mutations in the ATM gene (c.3214G\u003eGT; p.E1072X, c.6095G\u003eGA; p.R2032K, IVS41-1G\u003eGT and c.3801delG), while no deleterious mutations were identified in 190 spouse controls (p\u003d0.046). When considering only the mostly severely affected families, those with three or more pancreatic cancer cases, four deleterious mutations were found in 87 families (P\u003d0.009). These results indicate that ATM mutations play an important role in familial pancreatic cancer predisposition and have significant implications in the management of affected individuals and the risk assessment of family members.","title":"Genome-wide sequencing identifies ATM as a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2628"}
