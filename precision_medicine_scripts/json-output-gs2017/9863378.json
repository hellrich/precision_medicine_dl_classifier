Some patients are appropriately treated with the combination of irradiation and surgery. Chemotherapy is not effective as primary treatment of invasive cervical cancer but may be used as additional therapy and when the disease is recurrent or persistent. There are some important advantages of primary extensive surgery over irradiation. The findings at operation and that from the careful pathologic examination of surgical specimens can be very helpful in selection of patients for supplementary postoperation irradiation therapy or chemotherapy, or both [1-6].\nThe aim of the study was to compare pretreatment clinical evaluations with surgical and postsurgical pathohistological findings.\nExtensive hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy were used in the treatment of 251 patients with early invasive cervical cancer. The patients were treated at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the Clinical Centre of Serbia in Belgrade, between 1993 and 1995. Cervical cancer was detected by clinical examination, colposcopic and cytologic (Pap smear) findings, colposcopically directed biopsy or conisation and pathological findings, sonography, chest radiography, blood and urine analyses. In some cases we had to make other examinations (cystography, cystoscopy, intravenous pyelography, sygmoidoscopy, rectoscopy, CT scanning and magnetic resonance). The surgical treatment of invasive carcinoma of the cervix was limited to those patients in whom the disease was confined to the cervix or vaginal fornix (stage Ia, stage Ib or stage IIa), and who were in high surgical risk.\nOver a three year period (1993-1995) there were 251 patients with invasive cervical cancer, treated by primary surgery (radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy sec. Werthein-Meigs), average age 42 years. Most of the patients demonstrated invasive cervical cancer, clinically classified in Ib st. (81.67%). Some characteristics of pathologic findings, such as parametric width, number of removed lymph nodes, percentage of lymph nodes metastases and correlation with clinical stage of invasive cervical cancer, histologic grade of cervical cancer with lymph node metastasis, pathologic findings after surgical treatment, correlation between clinical and surgical staging, were already presented in tables.\nIn the last decades the incidence of invasive cervical cancer and death rate have been decreased. Progress in reducing mortality is primarily attributed to the introduction of cervical cancer screening as part of regular gynaecologic examinations. Regular testing with Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and colposcopy have an important role in this problem [1]. Extensive hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy were used in the treatment of 251 patients with early invasive cervical cancer. We found that the clinical diagnosis of disease extent was correct in 67.7% of patients who underwent extensive surgery for early invasive cervical cancer. Sensitivity of clinical findings was 75.8% and positive predictive value was 86.2%. Lymph node metastasis was detected in 17% patients. Brodman at al. [14] found that clinical examinations, including CT scanning and magnetic resonance, were correct in only 62.5% of cases. It is very difficult to detect parametric involvement and lymph node metastasis by clinical examinations. Irradiation therapy was used in the postoperative period as additional treatment of extensive hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy in 89.7% of patients.\nThe findings at operation and that from the careful pathologic examination of surgical specimens are absolutely irreplaceable and important in grading invasive cervical cancer and selection of patients for supplementary postoperate irradiation therapy.","title":"[Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix--3 years\u0027 experience].","pubmedId":"9863378"}
