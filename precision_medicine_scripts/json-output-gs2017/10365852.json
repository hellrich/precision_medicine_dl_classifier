Using 41 liver samples from patients with cholangiocarcinoma (including four with cirrhosis), 21 with combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma and 17 with hepatocellular carcinoma, the expression of sialyl-Tn, Tn and T antigens were characterized immunohistochemically and the correlation with apomucin profiles was evaluated. The prevalence of sialyl-Tn, Tn and T antigens expression was 89, 95 and 51% in cholangiocarcinoma without cirrhosis; 25, 75, and 0% in cholangiocarcinoma with cirrhosis; 29, 90, and 48% in combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma; and 0, 12 and 6% in hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Sialyl-Tn antigen was frequently expressed in cholangiocarcinoma without cirrhosis compared with cholangiocarcinoma with cirrhosis and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma (P \u003c 0.01). Although sialyl-Tn expression was associated with MUC1, MUC6 and MUC7 expression, the expression sites among them were not identical in the individual cases. These data suggest that the different expressions of sialyl-Tn antigen among cholangiocarcinoma without cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma with cirrhosis and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma may reflect the biological features inherent to these tumors, such as the ability of invasion.","title":"Expression of sialyl-Tn, Tn and T antigens in primary liver cancer.","pubmedId":"10365852"}
