Correlations between the expression of PTEN protein, Caspase-3 protein, and clinicopathological features of breast cancers were analyzed.\nThe loss expression rate of PTEN protein in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in benign breast diseases (33.7% vs. 0, P \u003c 0.01). Analysis of the clinicopathological features showed that PTEN expression level was negatively correlated with TNM stage, histological grade, axillary lymph node status, recurrence, and metastasis (P \u003c 0.05). The positive expression level of Caspase-3 was negatively correlated with TNM stage (P \u003c 0.01), but not related with histological grade, axillary lymph node status, recurrence, or metastasis (P \u003e 0.05). In addition, the expression of PTEN protein had significantly positive correlation with the expression of Caspase-3 protein in breast cancer (P \u003c 0.01).\nThe combination detection of PTEN and Caspase-3 may serve as an important index to estimate the pathobiological behavior and prognosis of breast cancer.","title":"Clinicopathological significance of PTEN and Caspase-3 expressions in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"18686628"}
