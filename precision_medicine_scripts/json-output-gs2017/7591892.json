Univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox regression model were performed to determine statistical significance of some tumor-related factors.\nThere were no significant differences in pelvic control rate (PC), distant metastases-free rate (DMF), cause-specific disease-free survival rate (CSDFS) among subgroups with cervix \u003c 60 mm in diameter. However, PC (p \u003d 0.023), DMF (p \u003d 0.000025), and CSDFS (p \u003d 0.0023) were significantly lower for patients with cervix \u003e or \u003d 60 mm than \u003c 60 mm. The 5-year CSDFS was 77.5% for \u003c 60 mm, and 28.6% for \u003e or \u003d 60 mm. Pelvic node status assessed by CT scans had significant prognostic impact on outcome. the 5-year CSDFS rate was 84.9% for patients with no enlarged nodes, and 58.9% for those with enlarged nodes greater than 1 cm in minimum diameter (p \u003d 0.023). Whereas PC was not significantly affected, the DMF was strongly correlated with nodal status (p \u003d 0.00027). Pelvic node status was taken as an independent predictor for DMF (p \u003d 0.019) on multivariate analysis.\nAlthough cervical size assessed by CT had limited prognostic value, pelvic node status assessed by CT is the significant prognostic factor for patients with uterine cervical carcinoma treated with radical irradiation.","title":"Prognostic value of cervical size and pelvic lymph node status assessed by computed tomography for patients with uterine cervical cancer treated by radical radiation therapy.","pubmedId":"7591892"}
