In this study, to study the association of ERK1/2 activation with mutation of Kras encoding an upstream activator of ERK1/2 in lung premalignant lesions, we immunohistochemically examined expression of phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and MAP/ERK kinase 1/2 (pMEK1/2) proteins and correlation between ERK activation and mutation of Kras encoding an upstream activator of ERK1/2, in a mouse lung carcinogenesis model. Female 7-week-old A/J mice were administered a single dose of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), then maintained without additional treatment until sacrifice at week 52. Histopathologically, adenocarcinomas, adenomas and hyperplasias were observed in the lung. pMEK1/2 was expressed mostly in the cell cytoplasm in all three. In contrast, pERK1/2-positive cells were also relatively rare in any histological types as compared with level of pMEK1/2 expression. However, pERK1/2-positive cells in adenocarcinoma were still markedly more common than in hyperplasias and adenomas (~5-fold, ~4-fold; P \u003c 0.01). Activating mutations of Kras gene at codons 12, 13 and 61 were detected in the majority of adenomas and adenocarcinomas, but without any significant relation to pERK1/2 expression. These results suggest that activation of ERK1/2 plays a key role in malignant transformation during lung carcinogenesis featuring Kras mutaion. Activation of ERK1/2 in lung premalignant lesions was little regardless of the mutation of Kras, and ERK1/2 activation in NNK-induced mouse lung carcinogenesis may be regulated not only by Kras mutation but also other signaling pathway or regulatory factor.
