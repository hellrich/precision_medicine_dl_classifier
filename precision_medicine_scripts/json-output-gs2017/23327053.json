The medical records of cervical cancer patients undergoing LRH and pelvic lymphadenectomy between April 2005 and August 2011 were reviewed. The subjects were divided into three groups according to time from conization to LRH: group 1 (within six weeks, n \u003d 17), group 2 (\u003e six weeks, n \u003d 38), and group 3 (no previous conization, n \u003d 40).\nThe three groups showed no significant differences with respect to patient and tumor characteristics, intraoperative variables such as surgical time, blood loss, conversion to laparotomy, and perioperative morbidity, while the complications in group 1 showed a significant difference compared to groups 2 and 3.\nLRH is feasible for the treatment of cervical cancer patients with previous conization and the appropriate time interval is after six weeks. A careful separation of the bladder and ureters from the cervix is recommended to minimize morbidity associated with this surgery.","title":"The influence of interval between conization and laparoscopic radical hysterectomy on the morbidity of patients with cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"23327053"}
