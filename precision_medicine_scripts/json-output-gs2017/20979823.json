Mutations of exons 18 - 21 of EGFR gene in patients were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and gene sequencing. The influence of mutations in EGFR gene on the growth, metastasis and survival rate of NSCLC was evaluated.\nEGFR mutations were detected in 30 (28.0%) of 107 patients. The mutation distribution was as follows: exon 18 (n \u003d 1), exon 19 (n \u003d 8), exon 21 (n \u003d 20), and exons 18 and 19 multiple (triple mutations, n \u003d 1). NSCLC with EGFR mutations had a higher growth velocity than that without EGFR mutations [M(Q(1-3)): 0.42 (0.17 - 1.04) mm/d vs 0.21 (0.19 - 1.00) mm/d, P \u003c 0.05]. EGFR mutations had no significant impaction on neither the lymph node metastasis of NSCLC (P \u003e 0.05) nor on the tumor metastasis to other organs (P \u003e 0.05). The mean survival time of patients with and without EGFR mutations were (18.2 ± 8.9) and (25.5 ± 7.8) months respectively. The 1, 2 and 3-year survival rate were 62.2% vs 72.2%, 47.7% vs 57.3% and 46.9% vs 56.3% respectively between patients with and without EGFR mutations. Log-rank test didn\u0027t show a significant difference among them (χ(2) \u003d 0.59, P \u003e 0.05).\nThe EGFR mutations promote the growth of NSCLC. But it may not be a factor of predicting prognosis.","title":"[Influence of mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor gene on growth, metastasis and survival rate of non-small cell lung carcinoma].","pubmedId":"20979823"}
