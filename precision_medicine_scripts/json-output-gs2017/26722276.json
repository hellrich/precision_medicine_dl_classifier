A decreased CCNG2 expression serves as a marker for poor prognosis in several types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to clarify the correlation of CCNG2 expression with overall survival and histopathological factors in pancreatic cancer patients. This retrospective analysis included data from 36 consecutive patients who underwent complete surgical resection for pancreatic cancer and did not undergo any preoperative therapies. The association between prognoses and the expression of CCNG2 was assessed using immunohistochemical staining. Multivariate analysis identified that the expression of CCNG2 is an independent prognostic factor. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival revealed that decreased expression of CCNG2 was a consistent indicator of poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients (P\u003d0.0198). A decreased CCNG2 expression significantly correlated with venous invasion in tumor specimens and the tumor invasion depth. In conclusion, CCNG2 expression inversely reflected cancer progression and may be a novel, independent prognostic marker in pancreatic cancer.","title":"Cyclin G2: A novel independent prognostic marker in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"26722276"}
