Tumour genotype may have a significant influence on the activity of sunitinib in patients with imatinib-resistant GIST. Sunitinib activity was observed across different GIST genotypes and particularly in patients with wild-type and KIT exon 9 mutations (all relatively resistant to standard-dose imatinib) and in patients with secondary KIT exons 13 and 14 mutations. Adverse events with sunitinib were generally mild to moderate and easily managed by dose reduction, dose interruption or standard supportive measures. Treatment discontinuation can be avoided in most patients by close monitoring before and during treatment with appropriate adverse event management as necessary. The correlation between treatment exposure and clinical response is prompting the search for new approaches to treatment optimisation to ensure that patients derive maximum benefit from sunitinib therapy, including dose adjustments based on blood testing to ensure optimal drug exposure, and the use of the alternative CDD regimen to avoid treatment interruption.","title":"Pharmacological management of gastrointestinal stromal tumours: an update on the role of sunitinib.","pubmedId":"19675092"}
