The retroperitoneum and thigh represent the most common anatomic locations for both the sarcomas. Despite their morphologic similarity, the issue of whether these 2 sarcomas share overlapping immunohistochemical and molecular features has not been well studied. We examined the expression of the lipogenic tumor-related markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), CDK4, and MDM2 in 15 cases of DDL and 45 cases of retroperitoneal/thigh UHGPS. Patients with DDL ranged from 31 to 82 years (mean 63 y) with a male:female ratio of 5:3. Patients with UHGPS ranged from 14 to 80 years (mean 52 y) with a male:female ratio of 3:2. All 15 DDLs expressed CDK4 and MDM2 (100%), and 8 of 15 cases expressed PPAR-gamma (53%). Twenty-three of 45 (51%) UHGPS expressed at least 1 of these 3 markers. We also studied MDM2 and CDK4 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 28 immunohistochemically positive cases, including 5 DDLs and 23 UHGPSs. All 5 cases of DDL showed MDM2 and/or CDK4 amplification (100%), whereas 6 of 45 UHGPSs showed MDM2 and/or CDK4 amplification (13%). Our results demonstrate that (1) the lipogenic tumor markers CDK4 and MDM2 can be used as surrogate immunohistochemical markers for the diagnosis of malignant lipomatous tumors with high sensitivity; (2) approximately 26% of retroperitoneal/thigh UHGPS cases that were positive for PPAR-gamma, CDK4, or MDM2 by immunohistochemistry showed characteristic CDK4 and MDM2 gene amplification, suggesting that a subset of UHGPS cases represent DDL despite lacking histologic evidence of lipoblasts.","title":"Overlapping features between dedifferentiated liposarcoma and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma.","pubmedId":"19574885"}
