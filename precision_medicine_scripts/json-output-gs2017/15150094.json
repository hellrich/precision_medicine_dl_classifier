Although other mutations have been reported, their functional consequences are poorly understood. In our earlier study, we demonstrated that colon tumor-associated B-Raf mutations within the kinase activation segment are not necessarily associated with an increase in mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/Erk) or nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) signaling activity or in NIH3T3-transforming ability. In this study, we examined the effect of colon tumor-associated mutations within the B-Raf glycine-rich loop (G loop) on MEK/Erk and NFkappaB signaling and on the transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts or IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells. Of the six G loop mutations examined, only the B-Raf G468A significantly increased MEK/Erk and NFkappaB signaling and NIH3T3 transformation. Only this mutation induced transformed phenotypes of IEC-6 cells. In contrast, the B-Raf G468E mutation significantly decreased MEK/Erk signaling and NIH3T3 transformation and had no effect on NFkappaB signaling. The B-Raf F467C mutation moderately elevated MEK/Erk signaling and NIH3T3 transformation. The other three B-Raf mutations, R461I, I462S, and G463E, did not increase MEK/Erk or NFkappaB signaling or NIH3T3 transformation. Except for F467C, none of the tumors with B-Raf mutations examined in this study had K-Ras mutations. These results suggest that some of the B-Raf G loop mutations reported in colorectal tumors do not increase kinase or transforming activities but might contribute to carcinogenesis via other mechanisms or be irrelevant to carcinogenesis.","title":"Different effects of point mutations within the B-Raf glycine-rich loop in colorectal tumors on mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and nuclear factor kappaB pathway and cellular transformation.","pubmedId":"15150094"}
