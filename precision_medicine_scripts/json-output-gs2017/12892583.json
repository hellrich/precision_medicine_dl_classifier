In contrast, COMP expression was weak to absent in the cytoplasm of cancer cells in pancreatic cancer tissues, and in ductal cells and islet cells in normal pancreatic tissues.\nCOMP is preferentially expressed in degenerating acinar cells in CP and in CP-like areas in pancreatic cancer, suggesting a potential role of this molecular in acinar cell dysfunction in CP.","title":"[Preferential expression of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein in degenerating acinar cells in chronic pancreatitis and in chronic pancreatitis-like lesions].","pubmedId":"12892583"}
