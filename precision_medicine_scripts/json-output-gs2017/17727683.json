Intact pancreatic tissue samples were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats with histologically proven pancreatic cancer (n \u003d 5), chronic pancreatitis (n \u003d 5), and two matched controls (n \u003d 5 per group). Two (1)H NMR experiments, single-pulse and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill, were carried out separately. Increases in phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine levels and decreases in leucine, isoleucine, valine, lactate and alanine levels were observed in chronic pancreatitis, whereas the opposite trends were observed in pancreatic cancer. Increasing taurine and decreasing betaine were found both in chronic pancreatitis and in pancreatic cancer. Additionally, the lipid content in pancreatic cancer was higher than that in chronic pancreatitis. PCA was carried out for the single-pulse and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (1)H NMR spectra, respectively, to visualize separation among the samples and to extract characteristic metabolites of pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Decreased phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine were suggested as unique metabolite indicators of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, even with the disturbance of various quantities of lipid contents pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis could be differentiated well by the combination of high-resolution magic angle spinning (1)H NMR and PCA. Thus this combination was demonstrated to have the potential to improve magnetic resonance spectroscopy for positive early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in clinical settings.","title":"Discrimination of metabolic profiles of pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis by high-resolution magic angle spinning 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and principal components analysis.","pubmedId":"17727683"}
