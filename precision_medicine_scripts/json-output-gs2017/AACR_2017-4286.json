Several small studies have identified pathogenic variants in 4% to 14% of unselected PC patients using multigene panels of predisposition genes, but only BRCA2, ATM, and PALB2 have been clearly implicated in this disease. We aimed to assess the clinical and molecular characteristics of PC patients referred for hereditary cancer genetic testing, and to estimate the risk of PC associated with pathogenic variants in panel-based cancer predisposition genes.Methods: PC patients (n\u003d1,819) were ascertained from a large cohort of over 140,000 patients undergoing multigene panel testing (MGPT) of predisposition genes between March 2012 and June 2016 at a single diagnostic laboratory. Clinical histories and molecular results were reviewed and summarized. Gene-level variant frequencies among PC cases were compared to those from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) to calculate gene-specific pancreatic cancer risk ratios.Results: PC patients were predominantly Caucasian (76.5%) and female (58.9%), with a median age at diagnosis of 61 years (51.7). Of these, 33.5% reported additional cancer primaries, and 44.8% reported a family history of PC. Overall, 15.4% of PC patients were found to have at least one pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in panel-based predisposition genes. Genes with the highest frequencies of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants included BRCA2 (3.9%), ATM (3.6%), CHEK2 (excluding p.Ile157Thr) (2.0%), PALB2 (1.5%), VHL (1.4%), CDKN2A (1.2%), BRCA1 (0.8%), and MSH6 (0.8%). 21.8% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers did not meet BRCA1/2 testing criteria and 61.5% of MSH6 carriers did not meet Lynch syndrome testing criteria. No CDKN2A families met diagnostic criteria for familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome, and 44% did not report any personal or family history of melanoma. To estimate associations between pathogenic variants and pancreatic cancer, Caucasian PC cases were compared to non-Finnish European, non-TCGA ExAC reference controls. Pathogenic variants in ATM, BRCA2, CDKN2A, MSH6, and PALB2 were significantly associated with high PC risks. Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 were associated with a moderate risk of PC (RR\u003d2.7).Conclusions: These findings shed light on the spectrum of mutations that can be expected for PC patients referred for cancer predisposition testing. The results confirm the associations of CDKN2A and BRCA2 variants with PC, and expand on the phenotypic spectrum associated with these variants. Furthermore, these results suggest that ATM, PALB2, and MSH6 may be high-risk PC genes, warranting further investigation in case-control and family-based studies.","title":"What have we learned from pancreatic cancer patients undergoing multigene panel testing.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-4286"}
