In Japan, adjuvant chemotherapy using oral administration of 5-fluorouracil is widely accepted in spite of no statistical evidence until the presentation by Kinoshita in 2005. In 1999, Fujimoto mentioned that adjuvant chemotherapy and chemo-immune-therapy cause a second malignancy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was once the standard treatment for early gastric cancer patients. So, we investigated the relation between adjuvant chemotherapy and second malignancy for early gastric cancer patients. As a result, adjuvant chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil(Tegafur)did was not cause second malignancy under multivariate analysis. The most important factor in second malignancy with post-operative early gastric cancer patients was heredity(cancer within first-degree relatives). From this point of view, early gastric patients after gastrectomy and endoscopic treatment are necessary in regular examinations to detect other organ cancers and remnant gastric cancer, especially in patients with hereditary factors.","title":"[Second malignancy after gastrectomy for early gastric cancer-is there any evidence that adjuvant chemotherapy for early gastric cancer causes a second malignancy ?].","pubmedId":"18701845"}
