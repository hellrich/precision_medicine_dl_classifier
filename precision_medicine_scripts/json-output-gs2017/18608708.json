These pictures were assessed by the same four observers at two time points. Patients were scored using the DLE-Skin Score (DLE-SS). In addition, the DLE-Photo Score (DLE-PS) was calculated. Statistical analysis was carried out by measuring inter- and intra-observer agreement for both methods and by measuring the correlation between the DLE-SS and DLE-PS.\nBoth the DLE-SS and DLE-PS proved reliable methods in the assessment of CDLE. The inter-observer variability of the DLE-SS and DLE-SS was low. The intra-observer variability was estimated to be 0 in both methods. The correlation coefficient between the DLE-SS and DLE-PS was high (0.81).\nBoth the DLE-SS and the DLE-PS are reliable and easy-to-use methods to score disease activity in CDLE patients, and can be used in monitoring single target lesions in clinical trials.","title":"Validation of clinical and image skin scoring systems for a single chronic discoid lupus erythematosus lesion.","pubmedId":"18608708"}
