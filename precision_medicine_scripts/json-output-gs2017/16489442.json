We describe a unique case of relapsing retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma with biochemical, immunohistochemical, and molecular evidence of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ectopic production. The lesion was associated to elevated AFP plasma levels that subsided after tumor removal. Immunohistochemical studies showed AFP production by a minority of tumor cells and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed AFP mRNA expression. Finding of MDM2 and CDK4 iperexpression by immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.","title":"alpha-fetoprotein expression in a dedifferentiated liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"16489442"}
