There were 42 males and 43 females, with a median age of 58 (30-87). ALK rearrangements were screened by using immunohistochemistry on Benchmark XT auto-stainer.\nThe frequency of ALK positive reactivity was 15.3% among the 85 patients. The incidence of ALK expression was more frequent in patients \u003c60 years as compared with patients ≥ 60 years of age (26.1%, 2.6%, χ² \u003d9.015, P\u003d0.002). Among the ALK-positive patients, 8 were males and 5 were females (19.1%, 11.6%, χ² \u003d0.903, P\u003d0.259). There were 8 never-smokers and 5 smokers harboring ALK rearrangement (17.0%, 13.5%, χ²\u003d0.379, P\u003d0.827). Among patients with ALK rearrangement, 6 received EGFR detection, and 5 showed no EGFR mutation, and 1 showed 19del EGFR mutation. Among the 13 ALK-positive patients, 4 received crizotinib therapy, and all showed partial response.\nPatients with lung adenocarcinoma with ALK rearrangement were significantly younger than those with ALK wild-type, and ALK rearrangement was rarely concur with EGFR mutation. Screening ALK fusion protein expression in patients with lung adenocarcinoma by paraffin-embedded sediments of pleural effusion was useful in guide of crizotinib therapy.","title":"[Relationship between expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase in pleural effusion and clinicopathological features of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and the response to crizotinib].","pubmedId":"26703339"}
