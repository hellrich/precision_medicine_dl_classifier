Their responses to current multimodal therapeutic regimens are limited. It is urgently needed to identify the molecular mechanism underlying pancreatic oncogenesis. Twelve core signaling cascades have been established critical in PDAC tumorigenesis by governing a wide variety of cellular processes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are aberrantly expressed in different types of tumors and play pivotal roles as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Here, we will describe how miRNAs regulate different signaling pathways that contribute to pancreatic oncogenesis and progression.
