The preoperative computer tomographic images of 6 acinar cell carcinoma patients and 67 pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients in 4 phases (non-contrast, arterial, portal venous, and delayed phase) were compared. The scan delay times were 40, 70, and 120 s for each contrast-enhanced phase. The visual pattern, tomographic attenuation value, and time attenuation curve were assessed and compared between AC and ACC cases using the χ² test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Mann Whitney U test.\nThe adenocarcinomas tended to be hypodense in all 4 phases. The acinar cell carcinomas also tended to be hypodense in the 3 contrast-enhanced phases, although their computed tomographic attenuation values were higher. Further, 5 of the 6 acinar cell carcinomas (83%) were isodense in the non-contrast phase. The time attenuation curve of the adenocarcinomas showed a gradual increase through the 4 phases, and all adenocarcinomas showed peak enhancement during the delayed phase. The time attenuation curve of the acinar cell carcinomas showed peak enhancement during the portal venous phase in 4 cases and during the arterial phase in 2 cases. None of the 6 acinar cell carcinomas showed peak enhancement during the delayed phase.\nThe tumor density in the non-contrast phase and time attenuation curve pattern clearly differ between acinar cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas, and multidetector-row computed tomography can thus distinguish these tumors.","title":"Comparison of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma using multidetector-row computed tomography.","pubmedId":"24039366"}
