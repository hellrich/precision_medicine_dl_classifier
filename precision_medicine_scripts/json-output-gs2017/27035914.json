Recent studies have reported the prognostic value of decreased LKB1 expression in different tumors. However, the results of these studies remain controversial. Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to more accurately estimate the role of decreased LKB1 in the prognostication of human solid tumors.\nA systematic literature search in the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and CNKI (updated to October 15, 2015) was performed to identify eligible studies. The overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and clinicopathological features data were collected from these studies. The hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled with a random-effects models using Stata12.0 software.\nA total of 14 studies covering 1915 patients with solid tumors were included in this meta-analysis. Decreased LKB1 was associated with poorer OS in both the univariate (HR: 1.86, 95%CI: 1.42-2.42, P\u003c0.001) and multivariate (HR: 1.55, 95%CI: 1.09-2.21, P \u003d 0.015) analyses. A subgroup analysis revealed that the associations between decreased LKB1 and poor OS were significant within the Asian region (HR 2.18, 95%CI: 1.66-2.86, P\u003c0.001) and obvious for lung cancer (HR: 2.16, 95%CI: 1.47-3.18, P\u003c0.001). However, the articles that involved analyses of both RFS and DFS numbered only 3, and no statistically significant correlations of decreased LKB1 with RFS or DFS were observed in this study. Additionally, the pooled odds ratios (ORs) indicated that decreased LKB1 was associated with larger tumor size (OR: 1.60, 95%CI: 1.09-2.36, P \u003d 0.017), lymph node metastasis (OR: 2.41, 95%CI: 1.53-3.78, P\u003c0.001) and a higher TNM stage (OR: 3.35, 95%CI: 2.20-5.09, P\u003c0.001).\nThese results suggest that decreased LKB1 expression in patients with solid tumors might be related to poor prognosis and serve as a potential predictive marker of poor clinicopathological prognostic factors. Additional studies are required to verify the clinical utility of decreased LKB1 in solid tumors.","title":"The Prognostic Value of Decreased LKB1 in Solid Tumors: A Meta-Analysis.","pubmedId":"27035914"}
