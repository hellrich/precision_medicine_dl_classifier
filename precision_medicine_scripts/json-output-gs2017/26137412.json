We have recently revealed that Natural Killer (NK) cells play an essential role in the BRAFV600E inhibitor control of melanoma metastases in mice that may be therapeutically exploited to help overcome drug resistance.","title":"Natural Killer cell control of BRAFV600E mutant melanoma during targeted therapy.","pubmedId":"26137412"}
