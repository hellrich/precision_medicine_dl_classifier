The tumors with amplified N-myc are initially sensitive to chemotherapy but often acquire resistance to therapy, recur, and ultimately kill the patients. We measured amplification and expression of N-myc and expression of mdr-1 in 35 surgically resected neuroblastomas, before acquisition of drug resistance and in 4 recurrent tumors resistant to chemotherapy. The mdr-1 mRNA expression was found to be inversely correlated with the N-myc expression. The mdr-1 gene expression was at a low level in advanced stage and histologically undifferentiated neuroblastomas, the same group of tumors in which N-myc expression is elevated. A significantly better prognosis was noted in those patients whose tumors had a high level of mdr-1 expression and a low level of N-myc expression. The role, if any, of increased expression of mdr-1 in the acquisition of multidrug resistance in neuroblastoma remains unclear. However, the aggressive clinical behavior associated with N-myc amplification and/or expression appears to be linked to down-regulation of mdr-1 expression.","title":"Inverse correlation between expression of multidrug resistance gene and N-myc oncogene in human neuroblastomas.","pubmedId":"2185879"}
