The role of β-catenin expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is somewhat controversial. Transcription factor PROX1 is a target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and it is involved in carcinogenesis through alterations in its expression. The actions can be either oncogenic or tumor suppressive depending on the tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate PROX1 and β-catenin expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\nExpression of PROX1 and β-catenin were evaluated in 156 patients by immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays. Associations between tumor marker expression and clinicopathological parameters were assessed by the Fischer\u0027s exact-test or the linear-by-linear association test. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for survival analysis. Uni- and multivariate survival analyses were carried out by the Cox regression proportional hazard model.\nHigh PROX1 expression was seen in 74 (48 %) tumors, and high β-catenin expression in 100 (65 %). High β-catenin expression was associated with lower tumor grade (p \u003d 0.025). High PROX1 and β-catenin expression associated significantly with lower risk of death from PDAC in multivariate analysis (HR \u003d 0.63; 95 % CI 0.42-0.95, p \u003d 0.026; and HR \u003d 0.54; 95 % CI 0.35-0.82, p \u003d 0.004; respectively). The combined high expression of PROX1 and β-catenin also predicted lower risk of death from PDAC (HR \u003d 0.46; 95 % CI 0.28-0.76, p \u003d 0.002).\nIn conclusion, high PROX1 and β-catenin expression were independent factors for better prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","title":"PROX1 and β-catenin are prognostic markers in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27411302"}
