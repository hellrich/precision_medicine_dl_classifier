Real-time quantitative PCR-Sanger sequencing and TaqMan probe method were performed to detect the KRAS/BRAF mutations. The frequency and types of KRAS/BRAF mutations, clinicopathological characteristics and survival time were analyzed.\nKRAS mutations were detected in 39.8% (137/344) and 38.7% (133/344) of 344 colorectal carcinomas by using real-time quantitative PCR-Sanger sequencing and TaqMan probe method, respectively. BRAF mutation was detected in 4.7% (16/344) and 4.1% (14/344), respectively. There was no significant correlation between the two methods. The frequency of the KRAS mutation in female was higher than that in male (P \u003c 0.05). The frequency of the BRAF mutation in colon was higher than that in rectum. The frequency of the BRAF mutation in stage III-IV cases was higher than that in stageI-II cases. The frequency of the BRAF mutation in signet ring cell carcinoma was higher than that in mucinous carcinoma and nonspecific adenocarcinoma had the lowest mutation rate. The frequency of the BRAF mutation in grade III cases was higher than that in grade II cases (P \u003c 0.05). The overall concordance for the two methods of KRAS/BRAF mutation detection was 98.8% (kappa \u003d 0.976). There was statistic significance between BRAF and KRAS mutations for the survival time of colorectal carcinomas (P \u003d 0.039). There were no statistic significance between BRAF mutation type and BRAF/KRAS wild type (P \u003d 0.058).\n(1) Compared with real-time quantitative PCR-Sanger sequencing, TaqMan probe method is better with regard to handling time, efficiency, repeatability, cost and equipment. (2) The frequency of the KRAS mutation is correlated with gender. BRAF mutation is correlated with primary tumor site, TNM stage, histological types and histological grades.(3) BRAF gene mutation is an independent prognostic marker for colorectal carcinomas.","title":"[Comparative analysis of real-time quantitative PCR-Sanger sequencing method and TaqMan probe method for detection of KRAS/BRAF mutation in colorectal carcinomas].","pubmedId":"24742565"}
