The correlations between MUC4 promoter methylation status in vivo and either pancreatic cancer progression or MUC4 mRNA expression need to be demonstrated. We used the techniques of quantitative real-time PCR and DNA methylation-specific PCR combined microdissection to precisely detect MUC4 expression and promoter methylation status in 116 microdissected foci from 57 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Both mRNA expression and hypomethylation frequency increased from normal to precancerous lesions to pancreatic cancer. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that high-level MUC4 expression (P \u003d 0.008) and tumor-node-metastasis staging (P \u003d 0.038) were significant independent risk factors for predicting the prognosis of 57 patients. The MUC4 mRNA expression was not significantly correlated with promoter methylation status in 30 foci of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. These results suggest that high mRNA expression and hypomethylation of the MUC4 gene could be involved in carcinogenesis and in the malignant development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The MUC4 mRNA expression may become a new prognostic marker for pancreatic cancer. Microdissection-based quantitative real-time PCR and methylation-specific PCR contribute to the quantitative detection of MUC4 expression in clinical samples and reflect the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of MUC4 in vivo.","title":"The increase in the expression and hypomethylation of MUC4 gene with the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20922503"}
