The aim of this study was to investigate genetic causes of familial breast cancer in a pedigree with recessive pattern of inheritance.\nWe applied exome sequencing as a useful approach in heterogeneous diseases gene identification in present study for familial breast cancer. Sanger sequencing was applied for validation and segregation analysis of mutations.\nHere, we describe a family with three affected sisters of early-onset invasive ductal carcinoma due to heterozygous frame shift mutation rs80359352 in BRCA2 gene as the first report in Iranian patients in association with a novel missense SNP of STK11 (p.S422G). These mutations are inherited from their normal father.\nDespite apparent recessive pattern of inheritance a dominant gene (here BRCA2) can be involved in pathogenesis of hereditary breast cancer which can be explained by incomplete penetrance of BRCA2 mutations.","title":"Double Heterozygosity of BRCA2 and STK11 in Familial Breast Cancer Detected by Exome Sequencing.","pubmedId":"26576347"}
