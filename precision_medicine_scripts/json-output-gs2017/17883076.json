Computed tomography of brain revealed a large lobulated, extra axial, hyperdense lesion in the right fronto-temporal region extending up to to the right frontal and ethmoidal sinuses, eroding the bone, enhancing homogeneously with contrast, which was suggestive of atypical meningioma. He had no predisposing factors that could lead to the suspicion of opportunistic infection. Craniotomy and total excision of the lesion was done. Histopathological study revealed aspergilloma.","title":"Cerebral aspergilloma presenting as atypical meningioma in an immunologically competent patient: a case report.","pubmedId":"17883076"}
