This tumor was composed of nodular, reticulin-free zones (pale islands) surrounded by densely packed, highly proliferative cells that produced a dense intercellular reticulin network. Some of the cells were heavily pigmented, and this pigment proved to be melanin. Adult age, desmoplastic nature, and melanin pigmentation are some of the rare features of this tumor that need documentation. Further, this pigment was in the primitive cells, unlike in the published cases, in which it was present in the tubular or tubulopapillary component. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published case of desmoplastic pigmented medulloblastoma, and the patient is the oldest reported to have this tumor.","title":"A melanotic desmoplastic medulloblastoma: report of a rare case and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"12622139"}
