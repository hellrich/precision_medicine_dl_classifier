This chapter will focus on the discovery of these mutations and describes their relevance to a wide range of common human tumor types.Of note, the identification and functional analysis of the PIK3CA gene are reviewed in other chapters in this book. However, a brief mention will be made here of its general properties as background to our focus on the discovery of its cancer-specific mutations.","title":"Oncogenic mutations of PIK3CA in human cancers.","pubmedId":"20535651"}
