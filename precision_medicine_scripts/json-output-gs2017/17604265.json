Postmortem examination discovered an adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar growth pattern as a cause of severe dyspnoea, extreme pulmonary hypertension, and chronic cor pulmonale. The tumour involved all lobes of the lung. In the hilar lymph node metastasis was detectable. Histology showed tumour cell emboli in branches of the pulmonary arteries, intimal fibrosis, which was associated with fibrin precipitation and involvement of lymphatic vessels showing lymphangiosis carcinomatosa. The intrapulmonary dissemination of the adenocarcinoma could be caused by the isolated haematogenous dissemination via the thoracic duct. The authors discuss the possible pathomechanism of pulmonary hypertension and the way of tumour cell dissemination in the lung. They highlight the histological changes, which accompany the syndrome of pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy. In this case, which can be regarded rarely published in the literature, they emphasise the differential diagnostic questions.","title":"[Primary lung cancer causing pulmonary artery microembolization and pulmonary hypertension].","pubmedId":"17604265"}
