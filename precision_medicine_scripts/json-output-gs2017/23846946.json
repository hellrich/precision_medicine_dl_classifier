Despite a strict surveillance protocol, some patients are diagnosed with metastatic distinct ductal adenocarcinoma after resection of IPMN.\nWe herein report a patient with unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that developed in the remnant pancreas 18 months after resection of branch duct IPMN. Although the patient was surveyed every 6 months after the operation and imaging studies at 6 and 12 months postoperatively demonstrated no evidence of recurrence, invasive ductal adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis appeared 18 months after the operation. The patient subsequently underwent chemotherapy; however, he died 9 months after the diagnosis of metachronous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nIn some patients with branch duct IPMNs, 6-month surveillance seems to be insufficient to detect resectable concomitant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Therefore, identification of high-risk patients who require surveillance at shorter intervals is urgently needed.","title":"Unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the remnant pancreas diagnosed during every-6-month surveillance after resection of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: a case report.","pubmedId":"23846946"}
