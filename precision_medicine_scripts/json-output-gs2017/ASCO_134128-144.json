{"genes":["pts","KIT exon 9","SDH"],"publicationTypes":["2014 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background:  S0033 was designed to study the impact of IM, randomized between two doses, in patients (pts) with incurable GIST.   Methods:  Full accrual to this phase III trial occurred over 8 months, ending 01SEP2001. A study amendment allowed collection of additional clinical information on long-term survival outcomes and annotation of any therapies subsequent to IM.  Results:  Of 695 eligible patients, 180 (26%) survived 8 years or longer [94 on IM 400 mg/day arm and 86 on IM 800 mg/d arm). The 10-year estimate of overall survival (OS) across both study arms combined is 22% (95% confidence interval (CI)\u003d19-26%). Additional therapy information was obtained for 137 long-term survivors: IM was the sole therapy, administered continuously, in 49%;  fifty-four (39%) received subsequent systemic agents, including sunitinib (41) and sorafenib (16). Local therapies, includingsurgical resection of metastases, radiofrequency ablation, and radiation therapy were also utilized in subsets. Univariate analyses with long-term survival data show that pts whose tumors harbored a KIT exon 9 mutation had a significantly shorter OS than those with KIT exon 11 mutations (p\u003d0.0013) or  KIT/PDGFRAwild-type (WT) genotypes (0.047).    Conclusions:  A significant subset of pts with metastatic GIST achieved durable long-term overall survival with single-agent IM. Further investigation of what enables pts to live progression-free for more than a decade is warranted to optimize treatment approaches in this oncogene-driven disease, as well as to improve outcomes for more challenging molecular subsets, including KIT exon 9 or SDH-deficient (KIT/PDGFRA WT) GIST.
