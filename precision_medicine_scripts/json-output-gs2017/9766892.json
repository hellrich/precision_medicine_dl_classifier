For primer construction FAV1, FAV10 and EDS virus hexon proteins were aligned and conserved and variable regions were determined. Two primer sets (H1/H2 and H3/H4) for single use were constructed which hybridize in three conserved regions of hexon genes. Each primer pair amplifies approximately half of the hexon gene including two loop regions. An amplification product was detected with both primer sets using purified DNA from all FAV1-12 reference strains. Viral EDS DNA was negative using the H1/H2 or H3/H4 primer pair. HaeII digestion of the H1/H2 amplification products differentiates between all viruses except FAV4 and FAV5. In comparison, much more clustering among genomic closely related FAV serotypes was seen after HpaII digestion of the H3/H4 PCR products. Oligonucleotides H5/H6 located in the variable regions of EDS virus hexon gene do not detect any of the FAV serotypes. The PCRs and REA described are suitable to detect all avian adenoviruses infecting chickens, to distinguish all 12 FAV reference strains and to differentiate FAVs from the EDS virus.","title":"Hexon based PCRs combined with restriction enzyme analysis for rapid detection and differentiation of fowl adenoviruses and egg drop syndrome virus.","pubmedId":"9766892"}
