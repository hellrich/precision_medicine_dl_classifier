These TRK fusions occur rarely, but in a diverse spectrum of tumor histologies. LOXO-101 is an orally administered inhibitor of the TRK kinase and is highly selective only for the TRK family of receptors. Preclinical models of LOXO-101 using TRK-fusion-bearing human-derived cancer cell lines demonstrate inhibition of the fusion oncoprotein and cellular proliferation in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. The tumor of a 41-year-old woman with soft-tissue sarcoma metastatic to the lung was found to harbor an LMNA-NTRK1 gene fusion encoding a functional LMNA-TRKA fusion oncoprotein as determined by an in situ proximity ligation assay. In a phase I study of LOXO-101 (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT02122913), this patient\u0027s tumors underwent rapid and substantial tumor regression, with an accompanying improvement in pulmonary dyspnea, oxygen saturation, and plasma tumor markers.\nTRK fusions have been deemed putative oncogenic drivers, but their clinical significance remained unclear. A patient with a metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma with an LMNA-NTRK1 fusion had rapid and substantial tumor regression with a novel, highly selective TRK inhibitor, LOXO-101, providing the first clinical evidence of benefit from inhibiting TRK fusions.","title":"An Oncogenic NTRK Fusion in a Patient with Soft-Tissue Sarcoma with Response to the Tropomyosin-Related Kinase Inhibitor LOXO-101.","pubmedId":"26216294"}
