Surgical resection provides the only possibility for cure. Advances in hepatobiliary imaging and surgical strategies to treat this disease have resulted in improved postoperative outcomes.\nWe performed a review of the English literature on hilar cholangiocarcinoma from 1990 to 2007. This review included preoperative evaluation, surgical techniques, issues and controversies in management, prognostic variables, and considerations for future directions.\nComplete resection remains the most effective and only potentially curative therapy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Negative resection margins are associated with improved outcomes, and major hepatic resections have enhanced the likelihood of R0 resection. Portal vein embolization may be indicated in selected patients before extensive hepatic resection. Staging laparoscopy should be considered to detect occult metastatic disease. Orthotopic liver transplantation might be applicable for a highly selected subgroup.\nSurgical resection including major hepatic resection remains the mainstay of treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Additional evidence is needed to fully define the role of orthotopic liver transplantation. Improvements in adjuvant therapy are essential for improving long-term outcome.","title":"Hilar cholangiocarcinoma: current management.","pubmedId":"19638920"}
