Compared with conventional Sanger sequencing (n \u003d 673), dual-priming oligonucleotide-PCR and MEMO sequencing detected more tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation (n \u003d 919 and n \u003d 1044, respectively), especially tumors with a benign, indeterminate, or nondiagnostic cytology. All BRAF-positive tumors that were histologically examined were shown to be PTC, regardless of cytology results. The clinical sensitivities of the three assays for detecting PTC were 54.8, 74.4, and 79.7%, respectively. BRAF V600E mutations in microcarcinomas (â‰¤ 10 mm) were detected more efficiently as the detection sensitivity of the assay increased (P \u003c 0.001). Tumor size correlated significantly with multifocality, extrathyroidal extension, and lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.003, P \u003c 0.001 and P \u003c 0.001, respectively), but the BRAF V600E mutation status was not associated with any of those features.\nHighly sensitive and specific molecular assays such as MEMO sequencing are optimal for detecting the BRAF mutations in thyroid FNAC because these techniques can detect PTC that might be missed by cytology or less sensitive molecular assays.","title":"Clinical implication of highly sensitive detection of the BRAF V600E mutation in fine-needle aspirations of thyroid nodules: a comparative analysis of three molecular assays in 4585 consecutive cases in a BRAF V600E mutation-prevalent area.","pubmedId":"22500044"}
