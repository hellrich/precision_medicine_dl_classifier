Interaction with its ligand, stem cell factor, is essential in the development of hematopoietic stem cells, mast cells, gametocytes, melanocytes, and interstitial cells of Cajal. C-kit expression has been identified in a number of different neoplasms that includes mastocytosis/mast cell leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, seminoma/dysgerminoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This study examines c-kit expression in uterine endometrial stromal sarcomas, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas using immunohistochemistry.\nArchival tissue from 38 patients with the uterine mesenchymal tumors (16 leiomyosarcomas, 8 leiomyomas, 11 low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas, and 3 high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas) was stained with polyclonal antibody for c-kit. Modified avidin biotin (ABC) immunoperoxidase method was employed for antibody detection. Individual tumors were considered positive if more than 10% of the cells comprising the neoplasm displayed immunoreactive staining. Staining intensity was graded 1+ to 3+ and distribution graded as focal (10-30% of the cells), intermediate (30-60% of the cells), or diffuse (\u003e60% of the cells).\nC-kit was positive in 12 (75%) of the 16 leiomyosarcomas. The staining was 3+ and diffuse in the majority of the positive tumors. C-kit expression was not detected in any of the 8 leiomyomas. Two of the 3 high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas displayed c-kit positivity. Staining was diffuse and 3+ in both of these tumors. Expression of c-kit was observed in only 3 of the 11 low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas.\nC-kit is expressed in uterine leiomyosarcomas and endometrial stromal sarcomas. Adjunctive diagnostic studies using c-kit may be useful in distinguishing leiomyosarcomas from benign leiomyomas in uterine tumors that offer uncharacteristic features. Furthermore, studies should investigate the prospect of treating these malignant tumors with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","title":"The proto-oncogene c-kit is expressed in leiomyosarcomas of the uterus.","pubmedId":"12893208"}
