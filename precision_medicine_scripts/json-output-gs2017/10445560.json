The aim of the present study was to clarify the molecular differences underlying the biological differences between IMHN and ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.\nThe expression of p53 and cyclin A in IMHN was compared with that in ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas immunohistochemically.\nIn IMHN, the incidence of p53 and cyclin A ascertained by positive nuclear staining was significantly lower than that in ductal adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, in ductal adenocarcinoma, p53 and cyclin A are topographically coexpressed.\nThese results suggest that the overexpression of p53 and cyclin A plays a role in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and sparse expression of both antigens in IMHN may partly contribute to its low-grade malignant characteristics.","title":"Reduced expression of p53 and cyclin A in intraductal mucin-hypersecreting neoplasm of the pancreas compared with usual pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"10445560"}
