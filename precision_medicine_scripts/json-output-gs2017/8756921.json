Eleven patients also received external-beam radiation therapy, and 13 patients received chemotherapy. Patency was defined as absence of jaundice or cholangitis that necessitated hospitalization, or as seen on hepatobiliary scans. Survival was determined from the time of stent insertion after brachytherapy.\nPatients with cholangiocarcinoma had extended mean stent patency of 19.5 months (range, 2-46 months) and mean survival of 22.6 months (range, 2-72 months). Patients with secondary malignant tumors had a mean patency of 4.8 months (range, 1.5-8 months) and a mean survival of 5.3 months (range, 2-9 months).\nRadiation therapy including intraluminal Ir-192 appears to extend stent patency and survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma treated with Gianturco metal stents compared with patients with other extrahepatic bile duct malignant diseases and patients treated without combined-modality therapy in other studies.","title":"Malignant biliary duct obstruction: long-term experience with Gianturco stents and combined-modality radiation therapy.","pubmedId":"8756921"}
