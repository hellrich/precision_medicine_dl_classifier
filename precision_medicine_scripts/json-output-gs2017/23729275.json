In this study, we genotyped the frequency of KRAS rs712 to test its effect on gastric cancer (GC) risk in a hospital-based case-control study in a Chinese population, with 181 histologically confirmed GC patients and 674 cancer-free controls, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. The TT genotype of rs712 was associated with an increased risk of GC when taking GG genotype as a reference (adjusted odds ratio (OR) \u003d 3.05, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.53-6.08). Similarly, the T allele of rs712 was associated with a statistically significant increase in susceptibility compared with G allele (adjusted OR \u003d 1.44, 95 % CI, 1.10-1.90). Our data demonstrated that the T allele of the let-7 binding site polymorphism rs712 in KRAS 3\u0027 UTR was associated with a significantly increased risk of GC, suggesting that the KRAS rs712 polymorphism may be a genetic marker for the development of GC.","title":"A let-7 binding site polymorphism rs712 in the KRAS 3\u0027 UTR is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"23729275"}
