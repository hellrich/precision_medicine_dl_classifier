This study evaluated the association between tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-308, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)+874 and interleukin-10 (IL-10)-1082 gene polymorphisms and cervical cancer risk.\nThe study population included 186 histopathologically confirmed cases of cervical cancer and 200 healthy controls. TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-10 and IFN-γ gene polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers.\nThe IFN-γ+874A/A genotype was associated with high risk for the development of cervical cancer [odds ratio (OR) 2.22, p\u003d0.012], and the A allele was associated with a 1.47-fold increased risk of cervical cancer (p\u003d0.009). In contrast, no significant difference was found in the frequencies of TNF-α-308G/A, TGF-β1 codons 10 and 25 C/C-G/G and IL-10-1082G/A gene polymorphisms between patients with cervical cancer and healthy controls.\nHomozygous IFN-γ+874A/T polymorphisms may be associated with increased risk for the development of cervical cancer.","title":"Association between cytokine gene polymorphisms and cervical cancer in a Chinese population.","pubmedId":"21719187"}
