The case series mentioned here were derived from highly selected groups from a much larger population of patients with recurrent disease; thus fully combined management may be only appropriate for a minority of people with recurrent disease. There is a need for multicenter randomized trials to better delineate the real benefits from the combined approach. Multimodality management of recurrent colorectal cancer, however, involves more than the combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy for a select minority of resectable patients. It involves the use of each modality to its greatest advantage for all patients, as determined by a multidisciplinary team of specialists. We should also not confine our attention to the treatment aspects of recurrent disease alone, as the greatest promise for improved survival could be with a more general application of total mesorectal excision. Because most people who develop local recurrence of colorectal cancer will die from their disease, the main contribution of a multimodality approach may be towards palliation.","title":"Multimodality management of locally recurrent colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"12507209"}
