Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is the predominant ligand for ERBB3 and can promote the heterodimerization of ERBB3 with other ERBB family members, resulting in activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways. AV-203 is a humanized IgG1/κ ERBB3 inhibitory antibody that completed a first-in-human phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of this preclinical study was to identify potential biomarker(s) that may predict response to AV-203 treatment in the clinic.\nWe conducted in vivo efficacy studies using a broad panel of xenograft models representing a wide variety of human cancers. To identify biomarkers that can predict response to AV-203, the relationship between tumor growth inhibition (TGI) by AV-203 and the expression levels of ERBB3 and NRG1 were evaluated in these tumor models.\nA significant correlation was observed between the levels of NRG1 expression and TGI by AV-203. In contrast, TGI was not correlated with ERBB3 expression. The correlation between the levels of NRG1 expression in tumors and their response to ERBB3 inhibition by AV-203 was further validated using patient-derived tumor explant models.\nNRG1 is a promising biomarker that can predict response to ERBB3 inhibition by AV-203 in preclinical human cancer models. NRG1 warrants further clinical evaluation and validation as a potential predictive biomarker of response to AV-203.","title":"Neuregulin 1 expression is a predictive biomarker for response to AV-203, an ERBB3 inhibitory antibody, in human tumor models.","pubmedId":"25542901"}
