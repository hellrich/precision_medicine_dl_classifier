Although in the majority of cases the changes occur only in the cancer cells there is a small proportion of cancers where a germline mutation confers an increased risk for cancer. Cancer susceptibility genes have effects that range from high to low penetrance with a corresponding high to lower likelihood for cancer in the carriers. Pancreatic cancer-prone families have been identified and some of the germline mutations responsible elucidated. Germline mutations in the BRCA2, CDKN2A/p16, hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2, LKB1/STK1, and PRSS1 genes have been associated with increased risk for pancreatic cancer. The concept of screening high-risk groups for pancreatic cancer is emerging, preferably in specialised centres with a multidisciplinary team approach.","title":"Pancreatic cancer genetics.","pubmedId":"12120238"}
