Extra-abdominal metastases are less frequent. In this report we describe the case of a patient with resected adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater who developed skeletal metastases in the lower extremity and brain metastases. We briefly discuss aspects of this comparatively rare gastrointestinal malignancy.","title":"Bone and brain metastases from ampullary adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19496199"}
