However, amplification patterns are consistent with the existence of four cores of amplification, suggesting the involvement of additional genes. Here we present evidence strongly suggesting the involvement of the recently characterized EMSY gene in the formation of the telomeric amplicon. EMSY maps at 11q13.5, 100 kb centromeric to the GARP gene, which has been mapped within the core of the distal amplicon. The EMSY protein was shown to interact with BRCA2 and has a role in chromatin remodeling. This makes EMSY a strong candidate oncogene for the 11q13.5 amplicon. DNA amplification was studied in a total of 940 primary breast tumors and 39 breast cancer cell lines. Amplification profiles were consistent with the EMSY-GARP locus being amplified independently of CCND1 and/or EMS1. EMSY RNA expression levels were studied along with those of five other genes located at 11q13.5 by real-time quantitative PCR in the 39 cell lines and a subset of 65 tumors. EMSY overexpression correlated strongly with DNA amplification in both primary tumors and cell lines. In a subset of 296 patients, EMSY amplification was found by both uni- and multivariate analyses to correlate with shortened disease-free survival. These data indicate that EMSY is a strong candidate oncogene for the 11q13.5 amplicon.","title":"Amplification of the BRCA2 pathway gene EMSY in sporadic breast cancer is related to negative outcome.","pubmedId":"15355907"}
