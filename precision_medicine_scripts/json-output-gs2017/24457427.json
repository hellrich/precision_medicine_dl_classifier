Overall, 45% of the tumors showed mutations and, in particular, 33% had multiple mutations. Based on our results, we conclude that the assessment of mutation status of multiple genes, including CDKN2A, could provide a genetic profile that can be useful as a prognostic and therapeutic marker in melanocytic tumors.","title":"Mutational profiling in melanocytic tumors: multiple somatic mutations and clinical implications.","pubmedId":"24457427"}
