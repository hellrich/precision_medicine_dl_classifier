We examined the reproducibility of MDM2 and CDK4 staining between 2 laboratories and between tissue microarrays and whole tissue sections. Sixty-two soft tissue tumors were immunostained at the Bergoni√© Institute, Bordeaux, France, and the Curie Institute, Paris, France. We also examined 203 soft tissue neoplasms on standard tissue sections and tissue microarrays. There was high concordance of results obtained from the 2 laboratories (with 2 different pathologists) for MDM2 (kappa, 0.93) and CDK4 (kappa, 0.8) staining. There also was excellent concordance between results on tissue microarray and on whole tissue sections for MDM2 (kappa, 0.80) and CDK4 (kappa, 0.93). Immunostaining for MDM2 and CDK4 is a reproducible technique that may be exported to different laboratories for routine use. Tissue microarray is indicated for studying large series.","title":"Reproducibility of MDM2 and CDK4 staining in soft tissue tumors.","pubmedId":"16707369"}
