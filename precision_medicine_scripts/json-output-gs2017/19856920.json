In many tumor types, p53 is deleted or mutated, but in others p53 is inactivated by overexpression or amplification of its negative regulator mouse double minute 2 (MDM2). A high-throughput screening effort identified 6,7-bis(4-bromophenyl)-7,12-dihydro-6H-chromeno[4,3-d][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine as a potent inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 protein-protein interaction. This screening hit was found to be chemically unstable and difficult to handle due to poor DMSO solubility. Co-crystallization with the target protein helped to direct further optimization and provided a tractable lead series of novel MDM2-p53 inhibitors. In cellular assays, these compounds were shown to upregulate p53 protein levels and p53 signaling and to cause p53-dependent inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis.","title":"Discovery and optimization of chromenotriazolopyrimidines as potent inhibitors of the mouse double minute 2-tumor protein 53 protein-protein interaction.","pubmedId":"19856920"}
