The current study was undertaken to determine the clinicopathologic characteristics, PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha) mutation frequency, and outcomes after metastasectomy in patients with BRAF-mutant mCRC.\nData from 1941 consecutive patients with mCRC who underwent KRAS/BRAF mutation testing between 2009 and 2012 at a single institution were identified to identify BRAF-mutant mCRC cases (92 cases). BRAF wild-type mCRC cases from 2011 (423 cases) served as a control group.\nBRAF-mutated mCRC was found to be significantly associated with older age at diagnosis, female sex, right-sided location, poorly differentiated morphology, and mucinous histology compared with wild-type cases. BRAF-mutant cases more frequently progressed from stage III disease (32% vs 17%; P \u003d .003) and among those patients with stage III disease, T4 disease was more common (48% vs 27%; P \u003d .05). PIK3CA was found to be co-mutated in 5% of BRAF-mutant tumors versus 17% of KRAS-mutant tumors (P \u003c .01) and 4% of BRAF/KRAS wild-type cases. Patients with BRAF-mutated mCRC presented more frequently with peritoneal involvement (26% vs 14%; P \u003c 0.01) and less frequently with liver-limited metastases (41% vs 63%; P \u003c .01). Patients with BRAF-mutated mCRC were less likely to undergo metastasectomy (41% vs 26% at 2 years from diagnosis of metastatic disease; P \u003c .01) and were found to have lower overall survival (P \u003c .01) after metastasectomy.\nBRAF-mutant mCRC is associated with worse clinical outcome. Patients with BRAF-mutant tumors more commonly develop peritoneal metastases, less frequently present with disease limited to the liver, and have shorter survival after metastasectomy compared with patients with BRAF wild-type tumors.","title":"BRAF mutation predicts for poor outcomes after metastasectomy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"24737664"}
