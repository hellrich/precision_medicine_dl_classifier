Cucurbitacin I was used as a pharmacological tool to investigate the role of STAT3 in Pim-1 activation. Stably overexpressing Pim-1 kinase cell lines were characterized for their response to IL-6 in vitro and for their growth rate as flank tumors in scid mice.\nInterleukin 6 receptor was expressed across multiple cancer cell lines. In Panc-1 cells, IL-6 treatment increased expression of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and Pim-1 kinase. Cucurbitacin I treatment alone increased pErk1/2 expression in wild-type and Pim-1-overexpressing cell lines and resulted in exaggerated Pim-1 kinase protein levels in control and IL-6-stimulated cells, suggesting that up-regulation of Pim-1 may be partially STAT3 independent. Pim-1 overexpression did not significantly affect growth rate in vitro or in vivo in Panc-1 or MiaPaCa2 cell lines.\nInterleukin 6 activates STAT3 and stimulates Pim-1 kinase in pancreatic cell line models. The regulation and consequence of Pim-1 expression seems to be highly context dependent.","title":"IL-6 stimulates STAT3 and Pim-1 kinase in pancreatic cancer cell lines.","pubmedId":"22273698"}
