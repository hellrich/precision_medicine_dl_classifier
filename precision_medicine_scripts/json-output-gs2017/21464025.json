In this study 22 intraoperative thyroid tissue samples (11 pathologic and 11 normal) were examined. Somatic single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed by LigthCycler melting method, while translocations were identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction technique. In tumorous sample 3 BRAF, 2 NRAS and one HRAS mutations were found, as well as one RET/PTC1 translocation. Results confirm international data showing that these oncogene mutations and translocations are linked to thyroid cancer. Cytological examination completed with genetic data may support the diagnosis of thyroid malignancies. In addition, genetic alterations may indicate malignant transformation and may become prognostic factors in future.","title":"[Comparative study of somatic oncogene mutations in normal thyroid tissues and thyroid neoplasms].","pubmedId":"21464025"}
