These genes encode a group of closely related 21,000 dalton proteins termed p21. An immunohistochemical study of ras p21 expression was carried out on paraffin sections of 54 human breast carcinomas using monoclonal antibodies to p21. The control group consisted of ten cases of benign fibrocystic disease. The p21 expression was significantly higher in cancer cells than in epithelial cells of control specimens. No correlations, however, were observed between oncogene product expression and tumor size, histologic type, or grade. As a group, tumors with axillary lymph node metastases expressed higher levels of ras p21 than nonmetastasizing tumors. However, because of the significant overlap in individual p21 values, it is unlikely that the immunohistochemical assay for p21 could be used to predict the behavior of mammary carcinomas.","title":"Expression of ras oncogene p21 protein in relation to regional spread of human breast carcinomas.","pubmedId":"2467732"}
