Expression of apoptosis-associated proteins (including cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase [PARP]) and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1 (AKT) signalling pathway were detected by Western blotting.\nTransfection of DEPTOR-specific shRNA successfully knocked down DEPTOR gene expression in transfected RPMI-8226 cells. These transfected cells, together with control RPMI-8226 cells, were treated with 20 Âµmol/l melphalan for 24 h. Knockdown of DEPTOR exacerbated melphalan-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis, increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, and reduced levels of phosphor-AKT.\nDownregulation of DEPTOR inhibited proliferation and increased chemosensitivity to melphalan in human multiple myeloma RPMI-8226 cells via inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway.","title":"Knockdown of DEPTOR inhibits cell proliferation and increases chemosensitivity to melphalan in human multiple myeloma RPMI-8226 cells via inhibiting PI3K/AKT activity.","pubmedId":"23613505"}
