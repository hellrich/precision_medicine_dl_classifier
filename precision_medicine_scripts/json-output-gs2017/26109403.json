However, vemurafenib was associated with a number of skin-related adverse events (AEs).\nTo investigate the incidence and management of vemurafenib-associated skin AEs.\nThis retrospective, observational study included adult patients with stage IIIC or IV melanoma who received vemurafenib between March 2010 and August 2013. Patients received oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily, with dose interruptions and reductions allowed for AE management.\nIn total 107 patients were treated with vemurafenib during the study period. The most frequent clinically important skin-related AEs were rash (64%), squamoproliferative growths (41%), photosensitivity (40%) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or keratoacanthoma (KA; 20%). Rare cases of granulomatous dermatitis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma were also found. Rash was manageable with corticosteroids and dose modifications; squamoproliferative growths and SCCs/KAs were treated with cryotherapy and surgical excision, respectively. Patients were counselled regarding phototoxicity. The uncontrolled nature and retrospective design of the study, and the small patient numbers are limitations.\nVemurafenib appears to have a predictable and manageable AE profile. Proactive management can limit the impact of AEs on patients, allowing treatment to continue despite toxicities.","title":"Cutaneous toxicities associated with vemurafenib therapy in 107 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic melanoma, including recognition and management of rare presentations.","pubmedId":"26109403"}
