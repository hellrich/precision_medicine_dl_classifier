This case report presents a patient with PJS with a concomitant breast cancer, bilateral stromal tumors with annular tubules of the ovaries, and adenoma malignum of the cervix.\nA 43-year-old woman presented with an advanced-stage breast cancer and a pelvic mass. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by laparotomy with a hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Final pathologic examination revealed a concomitant breast cancer with metastasis to the ovaries, bilateral stromal tumors with annular tubules of the ovaries, and adenoma malignum of the cervix.\nPatients with PJS are at a high risk for intestinal and extraintestinal malignancies and can present with multiple concomitant malignancies.","title":"A case of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome with breast cancer, bilateral sex cord tumor with annular tubules, and adenoma malignum caused by STK11 gene mutation.","pubmedId":"19955943"}
