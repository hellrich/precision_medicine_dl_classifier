In this study, we used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to analyze sporadic breast cancers at stages II and III from untreated patients. We obtained 4.1 chromosomal alterations per sample, less than in previous reports. We identified a small region in Xq27 with high-level amplification in 3 of 16 samples. This amplification has been reported only in pancreatic and gastric cancer cell lines and in testis tumors; in addition, this amplification had been reported in one primary breast cancer, but in a more extended region that we identified. We also identified a loss in 2p13, not previously reported in this neoplasia. The most frequent alterations were amplifications in 4q, 5q, 8q, 12p, and 13q and losses in 1p, 8p, 16p, 19q, and Xp. CGH provides data for better understanding of molecular events in this neoplasia.","title":"Identification of chromosomal changes with comparative genomic hybridization in sporadic breast cancer in Mexican women.","pubmedId":"15262439"}
