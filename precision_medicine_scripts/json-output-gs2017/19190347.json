Recently, it has been shown by several groups as well as ours that insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) overexpression is related to higher proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and highly invasive pancreatic tumors. Several studies have been carried out to understand the pathways that lead to growth factor-mediated signaling, but the molecular mechanism of receptor overexpression remains mostly unknown. Treatment with neutralizing antibodies or a specific kinase inhibitor against IGF-IR could block the receptor expression in PCA cells. Furthermore, we also showed that insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2, but not IRS-1, is involved in regulation of IGF-IR expression, which is most likely not transcriptional control. By blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway with rapamycin as well as other biochemical analysis, we defined a unique regulation of IGF-IR expression mediated by protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) and mTOR pathway. Moreover, we showed that the down-regulation of IGF-IR expression due to IRS-2 small interfering RNA can be compensated by overexpression of dominant-active mutant of PKCdelta, suggesting that PKCdelta is downstream of IGF-IR/IRS-2 axis. Overall, these findings suggest a novel regulatory role of IRS-2 on the expression of IGF-IR through PKCdelta and mTOR in pancreatic cancer cells.","title":"Insulin receptor substrate-2 mediated insulin-like growth factor-I receptor overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma through protein kinase Cdelta.","pubmedId":"19190347"}
