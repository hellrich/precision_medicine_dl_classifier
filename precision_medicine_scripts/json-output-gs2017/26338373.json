The rise is mostly due to an increased detection of small papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) (≤20  mm), predominantly microPTC (≤10  mm). Although small tumors generally have an excellent outcome, a considerable percentage may have a more aggressive disease and worse prognosis. The clinical challenge is to preoperatively identify those tumors that are more likely to recur.\nTo improve risk stratification and patient management, we sought to determine the prognostic value of BRAF V600E, NRAS or RET/PTC mutations in patients with PTC measuring \u003c20  mm, mainly microPTC.\nThe prevalence of RET/PTC fusion genes was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61 mutations were determined by PCR sequencing. To further elucidate why some small PTC are less responsive to radioactive iodine treatment therapy, we explored if these genetic alterations may modulate the expression of iodine metabolism genes (NIS, TPO, TG, TSHR and PDS) and correlated with clinico-pathological findings that are predictors of recurrence.\nThis study shows that tumors measuring ≤20  mm exhibited higher prevalence of BRAF V600E mutation, which correlated with aggressive histopathological parameters, higher risk of recurrence, and lower expression of NIS and TPO. Although this correlation was not found when microPTC were evaluated, we show that tumors measuring 7-10  mm, which were positive for BRAF mutation, presented more aggressive features and lower expression of NIS and TPO.\nWe believe that our findings will help to decide the realistic usefulness of BRAF V600E mutation as a preoperative marker of poor prognosis in small PTC, primarily in microPTC.","title":"BRAF V600E and decreased NIS and TPO expression are associated with aggressiveness of a subgroup of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26338373"}
