Data suggest that lung adenocarcinomas harboring c-METex14 are sensitive to c-Met kinase inhibitors. The highly selective c-Met inhibitor tepotinib is well tolerated and active at an oral dose of 500 mg QD. This single-arm phase II trial (NCT02864992) is investigating the efficacy and safety of tepotinib in patients (pts) with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring METex14. Methods: Adults with stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma who have failed 1 or 2 lines of systemic therapy, including a platinum doublet-containing regimen, are eligible. Tumors must harbor mutations that are known to cause exon 14 skipping, confirmed by a central laboratory, but not activating EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements. Pts receive tepotinib 500 mg QD until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal from treatment for other reasons. The primary endpoint is objective response rate. Secondary endpoints include progression-free and overall survival, safety, pharmacokinetics, and quality of life. Recruitment of 60 patients in Europe, USA, and Japan is planned. Results: Four pts (age 6477 years; 3 stage IV, 1 stage IIIB, all Caucasian males) have been enrolled. All had received two prior chemotherapy regimens including a platinum doublet. Pts have currently completed 15 cycles of tepotinib therapy. The majority of adverse events observed to date have been grade 1/2 in severity; grade 3 disease-related dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and pleural effusion were observed in one patient and grade 3 tepotinib-related elevated serum amylase in another. Of the 3 pts with post-baseline tumor evaluations, two have had an unconfirmed partial response and the third (with only one post-baseline assessment) stable disease. Conclusions: These initial data suggest that the efficacy of tepotinib 500 mg QD is comparable to that of less selective c-Met inhibitors in pts with c-METex14 NSCLC (ORR \u003e 40%). Tepotinib is also well tolerated. Recruitment to the trial is ongoing.
