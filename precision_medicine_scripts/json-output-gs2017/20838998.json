The primary endpoint was confirmed objective tumor response per RECIST and independent review. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP); objective response by (18)FDG-PET and by changes in tumor size and/or density (Choi criteria); pharmacokinetics and safety.\nIn the patients evaluable for response (N \u003d 102), the objective response rate was 3%; 59% of patients achieved stable disease, with 14% achieving durable stable disease ≥24 weeks; 38% had disease progression. Higher objective response rates were observed per (18)FDG-PET (N \u003d 91) (30%) and Choi criteria (41%). The median PFS was 16 weeks (95% CI \u003d 14-24 weeks); the median TTP was 17 weeks (95% CI \u003d 15-24 weeks). The most common motesanib treatment-related grade 3 adverse events included hypertension (23%), fatigue (9%), and diarrhea (5%). Motesanib did not accumulate with daily dosing.\nIn this study of patients with imatinib-resistant GIST, motesanib treatment resulted in acceptable tolerability and modest tumor control as evident in the proportion of patients who achieved stable disease and durable stable disease.","title":"Efficacy and safety of motesanib, an oral inhibitor of VEGF, PDGF, and Kit receptors, in patients with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"20838998"}
