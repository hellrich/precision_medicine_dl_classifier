Mutations in the EGFR kinase domain predict sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in lung adenocarcinoma, while activating point mutations in KRAS and BRAF confer resistance to the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab in colorectal cancer. The development of new generation methods for systematic mutation screening of these genes will allow more appropriate therapeutic choices.\nDetection of KRAS mutation in Egyptian colorectal cancer (CRC) patients by the KRAS StripAssay.\nExamination of 20 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is done to detect KRAS mutations by KRAS StripAssay. For the StripAssay, a mutant-enriched PCR was followed by hybridization to KRAS-specific probes bound to a nitrocellulose strip.\nAmong 20 patients, KRAS mutations were identified in 80% of patients by the KRAS StripAssay.\nOur preliminary results suggest that KRAS StripAssay is an alternative to protocols currently in use for KRAS mutation detection.","title":"The KRAS StripAssay for detection of KRAS mutation in Egyptian patients with colorectal cancer (CRC): a pilot study.","pubmedId":"23499205"}
