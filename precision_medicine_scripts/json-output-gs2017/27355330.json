MMR deficient tumors are considered to have better prognosis whereas BRAF mutation is associated with poor prognosis. Studies evaluating the combined effect of BRAF and MMR status suggest MSI-high and BRAF mutant patients have a poorer prognosis as compared to MSI-high and BRAF wild type patients. Emerging evidence suggests MMR status predicts the immune response to anti-PD-1 therapy in CRC patients; however little is known about combined MMR and BRAF mutation status in this context. Therefore, it is important to identify whether there is a differential response to anti-PD-1 therapy based on BRAF status in the subset of MSI-high CRC patients.\nWe report the first case of MSI-high, BRAF mutant metastatic CRC that had an excellent response (pathologic complete response) to anti-PD-1 therapy. We take this opportunity to review the similar cases in literature and discuss combined MMR and BRAF status as a potential biomarker for anti-PD-1 therapy.\nThe case presented illustrates that anti-PD-1 therapy can be effectively used to treat CRC patients with MSI-high and BRAF mutant status which is usually considered a poor prognostic category as opposed to MSI-high and BRAF wild type tumors. Future studies with anti-PD-1 therapy distinguishing these molecular subgroups will improve our knowledge of whether BRAF status can add to MMR status as a predictive biomarker for anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with metastatic CRC.","title":"Pathological complete response with anti-PD-1 therapy in a patient with microsatellite instable high, BRAF mutant metastatic colon cancer: a case report and review of literature.","pubmedId":"27355330"}
