There is little information in the literature with respect to Ang-(1-9) properties. A number of studies show a link between peptides of the renin-angiotensin system and thrombosis.\nWe have investigated the influence of Ang-(1-9) on stasis-induced venous thrombosis in the rat. The contribution of coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) and MAS receptor in the mode of Ang-(1-9) action was also determined.\nAng-(1-9) enhanced thrombosis development, decreased plasma concentration of tissue plasminogen activator and increased the level of its inhibitor (PAI-1). The action of Ang-(1-9) was reversed by selective antagonist of AT1 receptor, but not Ang-(1-7) antagonist. Ang-(1-9) did not bind to the AT1 receptor.\nAng-(1-9) enhances venous thrombosis in the rat because of the impairment of fibrinolysis. The prothrombotic effect of Ang-(1-9) is mediated by Ang II acting via the AT1 receptor.","title":"Angiotensin-(1-9) enhances stasis-induced venous thrombosis in the rat because of the impairment of fibrinolysis.","pubmedId":"23884911"}
