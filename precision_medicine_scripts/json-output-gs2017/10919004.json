Currently, radical resection is the only potentially curative treatment modality for these patients. However, complete resection is often impossible and, even when achieved, is typically followed by metastasis and/or local recurrence. During the past 25 years, patients with cholangiocarcinoma have received chemotherapy in an attempt to improve their prognosis; effective methods are systemic administration, hepatic arterial infusion, and intraductal infusion. 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, mitomycin C, and cisplatin remain the agents used most frequently (either singly or in combination) for treating cholangiocarcinoma. In particular, 5-fluorouracil has been a component of most chemotherapy regimens for bile duct cancer. However, regardless of the administration scheme, results from the use of 5-fluorouracil as a single agent have been disappointing. Recent phase II (albeit small-population) trials that addressed the biochemical modulation of 5-fluorouracil in combination with methotrexate, leucovorin, cisplatin, interferon, or mitomycin C yielded better results than did a classic (combination of 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, and mitomycin C) FAM regimen. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy was associated with the highest response rate and survival in patients with localized cholangiocarcinoma (localized in the liver, with no extra-hepatic metastasis); however, these results need to be confirmed in large, randomized trials. Studies regarding intraductal chemotherapy for patients with obstructive jaundice are still in the preliminary stages; therefore, no associated benefit could be ascertained. The present review discusses current chemotherapy regimens for bile duct cancer and outlines possible future clinical investigations.","title":"Chemotherapy for bile duct carcinoma in the light of adjuvant chemotherapy to surgery.","pubmedId":"10919004"}
