MET signaling pathway is involved in oncogenesis in various cancers. Nothing is currently known about the role of MET in ITACs.\nIn a series of 72 ITACs, we investigated MET protein levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene copy number by in situ hybridization. These findings were analyzed as a function of clinical data, histological typing, and patient outcome.\nMET protein was overproduced in 64% of cases and chromosome 7 polysomy was observed in 52% of cases. No tumor displayed MET amplification. The presence of mucinous or solid histological components, T3/T4 tumors, and incomplete resection were associated with a poor outcome.\nMET is overproduced in about two third of ITACs, suggesting a role for the MET signaling pathway in the oncogenesis of these tumors.","title":"Study of MET protein levels and MET gene copy number in 72 sinonasal intestinal-type adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"24913906"}
