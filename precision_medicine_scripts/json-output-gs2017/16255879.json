Blood samples were collected and serum carcinoma markers CA19-9, CA242, CA50 and CEA were measured. Fecal K-ras and p53 gene mutation were also measured. We decided the optimal cut-off points with receiver operating characteristic curves and calculated the areas under the curve (AUC).\nThe AUC of serum CA19-9 and CA242 were 0.855 +/- 0.031 (95% CI 0.794 - 0.916) and 0.859 +/- 0.031 (95% CI 0.799 - 0.920) respectively. The optimal cut-off point for serum CA19-9 was 68 U/ml, with the sensitivity of 84.4% (98/116) and the specificity of 84.3% (145/172) for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The optimal cut-off point for serum CA242 was 25 U/ml, with the sensitivity of 88.4% (84/95) and the specificity of 79.1% (144/182). The sensitivity of fecal K-ras mutation was 77.8%, and the specificity was 82.2%. The sensitivity and specificity of fecal p53 gene mutation were 27.8% and 95.2% respectively. The diagnostic scale of pancreatic cancer was calculated by four variables: serum CA19-9, CA242, fecal K-ras and p53, of which each variable deserved one point if measured positive. The optimal cut-off point for the scale was 2, and the AUC of the diagnostic scale was 0.946 +/- 0.017 (95% CI 0.912 - 0.980).\nSerum CA19-9 and CA242 are valuable diagnostic tools for pancreatic cancer. The diagnostic value will be further improved when they are combined with the measurement of fecal K-ras and p53 gene mutation.","title":"[The diagnostic value of serum carcinoma markers, fecal K-ras and p53 gene mutation in pancreatic cancers].","pubmedId":"16255879"}
