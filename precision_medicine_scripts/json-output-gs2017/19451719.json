ABCC2 plays an important role in the biliary clearance of endogenous and exogenous toxic compounds. Recently, the ABCC2 variant c.3972C\u003eT in exon 28 has been shown to be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma risk. Our aim was to assess the role of this ABCC2 variant on cholangiocarcinoma susceptibility.\nProspectively, we recruited 60 cholangiocarcinoma patients and 73 healthy controls of Caucasian origin. The c.3972C\u003eT polymorphism was genotyped using solution-phase hybridization reactions with 5\u0027-nuclease and fluorescence detection (TaqMan assays).\nAllele frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p \u003e 0.05). The c.3972T allele was significantly more frequent in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (39.2%) compared to healthy controls (26.0%, p \u003d 0.022), resulting in an odds ratio (OR) of 1.83 (95% CI \u003d 1.09-3.08). Armitage\u0027s trend test showed a significant association between genotypes and cancer susceptibility (p \u003d 0.026, OR \u003d 1.95).\nWe describe a novel association between the common ABCC2 variant c.3972C\u003eT and cholangiocarcinoma risk. Further studies are warranted to replicate our findings in different populations and to elucidate the mechanisms of this observation.","title":"Association of the c.3972C\u003eT variant of the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 Gene (MRP2/ABCC2) with susceptibility to bile duct cancer.","pubmedId":"19451719"}
