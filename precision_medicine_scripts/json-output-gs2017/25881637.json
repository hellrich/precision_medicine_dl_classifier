Nabpaclitaxel plus gemcitabine activity was demonstrated in first line setting, but there are no clear evidence suggesting its use after that. We report a retrospective data analysis of 23 patients who received nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine after first line treatment at our Oncology Department. We observed a significant clinical benefit (43,5%) with a median overall survival of 5 months. In addition, manageable side effects were reported. Our data, despite the small sample, seem to indicate that nab- paclitaxel plus gemcitabine is an active and well tolerated regimen even in pretreated patients.
