The study of PanINs holds great promise for the identification of early detection markers and effective cancer-preventing strategies. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) represents an intriguing target for therapeutic and preventive approaches in various human malignancies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a selective COX-2 inhibitor to prevent the progression of PanINs in a conditional Kras(G12D) mouse model. Offspring of LSL-KRAS(G12D) x PDX-1-Cre intercrosses were randomly allocated to a diet supplemented with the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide (400 ppm) or a control diet. After 10 months, animals were sacrificed. Successful recombination in the pancreas was evaluated by PCR. The pancreas of KRAS(G12D);PDX-1-Cre mice was analyzed for the presence of murine PanINs. Animals fed the COX-2 inhibitor had significantly fewer PanIN-2 and PanIN-3 lesions than control animals (P \u003c 0.05). Ten percent of all pancreatic ducts in the nimesulide-fed animals showed PanIN-2 or PanIN-3 lesions, whereas 40% of the pancreatic ducts in the control animals had PanIN-2 or PanIN-3 lesions. Intrapancreatic prostaglandin E(2) levels were reduced in nimesulide-fed animals. Immunohistochemistry confirmed COX-2 expression in early and late PanINs. In summary, we found that the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide delays the progression of pancreatic cancer precursor lesions in a preclinical animal model. These data highlight the importance of COX-2 in the development of pancreatic cancer. Inhibition of COX-2 may represent an intriguing strategy to prevent pancreatic cancer in high-risk patients.","title":"Delayed progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia in a conditional Kras(G12D) mouse model by a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor.","pubmedId":"17652141"}
