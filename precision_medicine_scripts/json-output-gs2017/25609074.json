The aim of this study was to evaluate the cumulative incidence of meningiomas in a cohort of CCS who previously underwent CRT.\nWe considered all CCS who received CRT and were followed up at the \"Transition Unit for Childhood Cancer Survivors\" in Turin. Even though asymptomatic, they had at least one brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging performed at a minimum interval of 10 years after treatment for pediatric cancer.\nWe identified 90 patients (median follow-up 24.6 years). Fifteen patients developed meningioma (median time from pediatric cancer, 22.5 years). In four patients, it was suspected on the basis of neurological symptoms (i.e., headache or seizures), whereas all other cases, including five giant meningiomas, were discovered in otherwise asymptomatic patients. Multiple meningiomas were discovered in four CCS. Ten patients underwent surgical resection. An atypical meningioma (grade II WHO) was reported in four patients. One patient with multiple meningiomas died for a rapid growth of the intracranial lesions. A second neoplasm (SN) other than meningioma was diagnosed in five out of the 15 patients with meningioma and in ten out of the 75 CCS without meningioma. Cox multivariate analysis showed that the occurrence of meningioma was associated with the development of other SNs, whereas age, sex, or CRT dose had no influence.\nCCS at risk of the development of meningioma deserve close clinical follow-up, especially those affected by other SNs.","title":"Meningiomas after cranial radiotherapy for childhood cancer: a single institution experience.","pubmedId":"25609074"}
