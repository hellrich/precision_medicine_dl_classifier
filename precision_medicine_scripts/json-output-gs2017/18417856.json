It has features of a typical benign meningioma with many small or large vascular channels which may predominate over its meningothelial elements. We present here a series of three cases of angiomatous meningioma, which posed diagnostic difficulty to clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists. All the three cases showed a tumor entirely composed of thin-walled vascular channels and cells with bland morphology in the background. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. We present series of three cases to highlight the histomorphological features of this uncommon variant of meningioma that could help in distinguishing it from hemangioblastoma and hemangiopericytoma.","title":"Angiomatous meningioma: a diagnostic dilemma.","pubmedId":"18417856"}
