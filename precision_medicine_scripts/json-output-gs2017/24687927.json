Analysis was restricted to BRAF-wild-type tumors, because BRAF mutation was associated with poor prognosis, and BRAF and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive.\nThe seven most common KRAS mutations in codon 12 and codon 13 were examined in 2,478 BRAF-wild-type tumors. Because KRAS mutations in codon 12 (n \u003d 779) or 13 (n \u003d 220) were not predictive of adjuvant cetuximab benefit, study arms were pooled for analysis. Disease-free survival (DFS) was evaluated by HRs using Cox models.\nKRAS mutations in codon 12 (multivariate HR, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.28-1.80; P \u003c 0.0001) or codon 13 (multivariate HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04-1.77; P \u003d 0.0248) were significantly associated with shorter DFS compared with patients with wild-type KRAS/BRAF tumors, independent of covariates. KRAS codon 12 mutations were independently associated with proficient mismatch repair (P \u003c 0.0001), proximal tumor site (P \u003c 0.0001), low grade, age, and sex, whereas codon 13 mutations were associated with proximal site (P \u003c 0.0001).\nKRAS mutations in either codon 12 or 13 are associated with inferior survival in patients with resected stage III colon cancer. These data highlight the importance of accurate molecular characterization and the significant role of KRAS mutations in both codons in the progression of this malignancy in the adjuvant setting.
