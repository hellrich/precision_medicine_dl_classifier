All of the patients showed improvement in visual acuity and visual fields.\nA rapid response to radiation therapy may occur in some patients with optic nerve sheath meningioma. In such patients, it may be possible to customize the radiation dose by assessing of visual function during the course of therapy.","title":"Optic nerve sheath meningioma: visual improvement during radiation treatment.","pubmedId":"16876528"}
