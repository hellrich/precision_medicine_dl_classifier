It is unknown whether such activity also occurs in patients with EGFR gene overexpression, regardless of mutation status. This phase II study investigated the activity and safety of afatinib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with increased EGFR gene copy number and/or gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), with or without EGFR mutation.\nEGFR gene overexpression was assessed by FISH analysis; patients with high polysomy or gene amplification were considered FISH positive. Patients received daily afatinib less than or equal to 50â€‰mg (monotherapy). Endpoints included objective response rate (ORR; primary), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.\nOf 223 patients screened, 69 patients were FISH-positive and met eligibility criteria for treatment. The ORR was 13.0% overall (n \u003d9 of 69). Higher ORRs were observed in patients with gene amplification (20.0%; n \u003d5 of 25) and EGFR mutation-positive tumors (25.0%; n \u003d3 of 12). The DCR was 50.7% overall (n \u003d 35 of 69; median duration: 24.9 weeks) with higher DCRs observed in patients with gene amplification 64.0%; (n \u003d 16 of 25), and in patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors 66.7% (n \u003d 8 of 12). In the overall population, median PFS was 8.4 weeks and median OS was 50.4 weeks. The most common afatinib-related adverse events were rash/acne (83%) and diarrhea (78%).\nFirst- or second-line afatinib demonstrated preliminary activity and manageable safety in EGFR FISH-positive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","title":"Phase II study of afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family blocker, in EGFR FISH-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25514804"}
