ERBB2 expression increased and ERBB4 decreased from normal samples to carcinomas. There was no difference between NMCs and MCs in ERBB2, ERBB3 and ERBB4, but the NMCs expressed more EGFR than both NU and MC samples. There were no associations with T category, grade or survival. All combinations of expression levels for the four receptors were detected, with no dominant profile.\nWe hypothesise that: (i) ERBB4 is important for differentiation in NU; (ii) ERBB2 is up-regulated with carcinogenesis in the urinary bladder but does not discriminate between bladder cancer with or without metastases; (iii) EGFR may be a marker of indolent disease. A current hypothesis, that superficial layers of NU do not express EGFR and thus protect the basal cells from the mitogenic effect of urinary EGF, is challenged.","title":"Expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor family in normal and malignant urothelium.","pubmedId":"15892828"}
