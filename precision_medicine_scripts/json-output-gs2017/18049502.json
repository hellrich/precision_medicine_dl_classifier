Adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce the recurrence rate of the disease. It is therefore important that those who may benefit from such therapy are offered the optimal regimens in due time. The background for adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer is presented.\nThe manuscript is based on a survey of randomized clinical trials (from 1990 to 2007) retrieved from PubMed, and on own clinical experience.\nCure rates after curative resections of colon cancer (stage III) are improved by about 12% if patients are treated with adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin combined with 5-fluoruracil and folinat (or capecitabine) for 6 months. Certain subgroups of stage II (Dukes\u0027 stage B) are also likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.","title":"[Adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer].","pubmedId":"18049502"}
