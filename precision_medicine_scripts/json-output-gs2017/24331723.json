Serum CEA and CA 19-9 levels were normal. Splenopancreasectomy found a desmoid tumour. A 69-year-old male was referred to our institution for chronic anemia and inflammatory syndrome with splenomegaly. Splenectomy showed an important splenic congestion and siderosis. Both patients had a type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, histological examination revealed pancreatic endocrine microadenomas. The two patients\u0027 postoperative course was unremarkable.
