We examined 528 samples of tumor DNA from patients with primary breast cancer for MI, using 14 polymorphic CA-repeat markers. The frequency of MI in these tumors was unexpectedly low (10/528, 1.9%). The ten MI+ tumors were analyzed for mutations in five potential target genes that contain simple repeat sequences (TGFBIIR, IGF2R, hMSH6, BAX and PTEN/MMAC1). A somatic insertion of an extra adenine in the (A)6 region at codon 321-323 (exon 8) of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene, leading to a frame-shift, was identified in one tumor. This observation represented the first documented instance of PTEN/MMAC1 alteration in a MI+ primary breast cancer.","title":"Somatic mutation of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in breast cancers with microsatellite instability.","pubmedId":"10503872"}
