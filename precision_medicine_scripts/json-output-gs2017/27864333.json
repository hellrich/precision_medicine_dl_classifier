Previous results indicated that serum levels of CA125 (encoded by MUC16) could be used to predict which groups of pancreatic cancer patients may benefit from surgery. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Herein, using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and clinicopathological data obtained from our center, we demonstrate that high CA125 serum levels and expression levels of MUC16 are predictive of poor prognosis. Combination with in vivo and in vitro experimental data, we validated that MUC16 is a downstream target of KRAS, and their expression strongly correlated with each other. Mechanistically, the KRAS/ERK axis induced up-regulation of MUC16 and shedding of CA125 via its effector c-Myc in SW1990 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, proto-oncogene c-Myc could bind to the promoter of MUC16 and transcriptionally activate its expression. Taken together, these data establish CA125 as a prognostic marker for pancreatic cancer, and mechanistic studies uncovered the KRAS/c-Myc axis as a driving factor for up-regulation of MUC16.\nThe current study uncovers the contribution of oncogenic KRAS to serum marker CA125 production through a mechanism that involves the ERK/c-Myc axis.","title":"Oncogenic KRAS Targets MUC16/CA125 in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27864333"}
