Mucin protein epitopes and mRNA levels were frequently altered in adenocarcinomas compared to corresponding normal tissues. Clinically, hepatolithiasis has been regarded as a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma. The aims of this study were to determine the possible alteration of mucin gene expression in stone-containing intrahepatic bile ducts and cholangiocarcinomas and to try to predict whether or not hepatolithiasis has a predisposition to development of cholangiocarcinoma. In situ hybridization with DIG-tailed oligonucleotides was performed on sections of paraffin-embedded tissues of stone-containing intrahepatic bile ducts, cholangiocarcinomas, and normal controls to identify the expression of MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5B, and MUC5AC in nonneoplastic and neoplastic biliary epithelium. The findings showed that (1) while multiple diverse mucin genes were expressed in the biliary epithelium, MUC3 and MUC5B mRNA were the main mucin genes expressed in the biliary epithelium of stone-containing intrahepatic bile ducts and normal controls; (2) absent or decreased expression of MUC2, MUC3, and MUC5B of mRNA was found in cholangiocarcinomas in contrast to nonneoplastic biliary epithelium; and (3) increased expression of MUC4 and MU5AC of mRNA was found in cholangiocarcinomas and the biliary epithelium, especially for dysplastic cells of stone-containing intrahepatic bile ducts compared with normal controls. In this study, using in situ hybridization we demonstrated that neoplastic transformation of the biliary epithelium is accompained by alterations in mucin gene expression, the altered mucin gene expression in dysplastic cells of stone-containing intrahepatic bile ducts may reflect a higher potential for malignant transformation in these cells, and it could be a precursor of cholangiocarcinoma in the presence of hepatolithiasis.","title":"Altered mucin gene expression in stone-containing intrahepatic bile ducts and cholangiocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"11680592"}
