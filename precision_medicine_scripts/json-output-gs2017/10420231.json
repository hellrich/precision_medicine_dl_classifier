We describe a patient with a family history consistent with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer who had 3 malignant lesions in the right colon, namely, a mucinous cancer, a lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, and a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with prominent lymphoid stroma. To the best of our knowledge, lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma has not been described previously in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.","title":"Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the colon in a patient with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"10420231"}
