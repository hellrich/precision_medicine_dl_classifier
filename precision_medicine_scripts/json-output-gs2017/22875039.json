The B-Raf protein kinase, a key hub in the canonical MAPK signaling cascade, is mutated in a broad range of human cancers and especially in malignant melanoma. The most prevalent B-Raf(V600E) mutant exhibits elevated kinase activity and results in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, thus making it a promising drug target for cancer therapy. Herein, we describe the development of novel B-Raf(V600E) selective inhibitors via multi-step virtual screening and hierarchical hit optimization. Nine hit compounds with low micromolar IC(50) values were identified as B-Raf(V600E) inhibitors through virtual screening. Subsequent scaffold-based analogue searching and medicinal chemistry efforts significantly improved both the inhibitor potency and oncogene selectivity. In particular, compounds 22f and 22q possess nanomolar IC(50) values with selectivity for B-Raf(V600E)in vitro and exclusive cytotoxicity against B-Raf(V600E) harboring cancer cells.","title":"Development of a novel class of B-Raf(V600E)-selective inhibitors through virtual screening and hierarchical hit optimization.","pubmedId":"22875039"}
