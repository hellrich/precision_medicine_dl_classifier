Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin/etoposide (PE) or CAV (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and vincristine) alternating with PE was established as standard regimens. Dose intensive chemotherapy, such as weekly regimens or using G-CSF, is being investigated. In patients with limited disease (LD), combined modality treatment is proven to produce favorable results, but the best sequence or fractionation of thoracic radiotherapy is unknown. More progress in the treatment of small cell lung cancer is expected.","title":"[Chemotherapy of small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"8751797"}
