A strong correlation was found between c-myc and CCNE2 amplification (P \u003c 0.01). The breast cancers showing c-myc and CCNE2 amplifications were all aneuploidy, and were HER2 positive (P \u003c 0.05). Tumors with c-myc amplification also showed higher Ki-67 index (P \u003c 0.05).\nC-myc and CCNE2 amplifications are common events in breast cancer, and they often coexist. C-myc and CCNE2 genes may play critical roles in the pathogenesis and development of breast cancer through unique and overlapping signaling pathways.","title":"[Evaluation of c-myc and CCNE2 amplification in breast cancer with quantitative multi-gene fluorescence in-situ hybridization].","pubmedId":"25327794"}
