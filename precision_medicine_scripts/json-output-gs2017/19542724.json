He was diagnosed as having advanced ampullary carcinoma(T4 N0 H1, Stage IV b). To reduce the degree of obstructive jaundice, a self-expandable metallic stent was placed in the area of the biliary obstruction. Immediately after relief from obstructive jaundice, combination chemotherapy of S-1 and gemcitabine was given. Subsequently, CA19-9, the tumormarker level was reduced, the metastatic liver tumor disappeared, and the size of the primary lesion was remarkably reduced. Therefore, a curative surgical resection was done. This is a very instructive case for developing effective chemotherapy options to treat biliary tract cancers involving ampullary carcinoma.","title":"[A case of advanced ampullary carcinoma successfully resected after primary chemotherapy with s-1 and gemcitabine].","pubmedId":"19542724"}
