The melanoma was located on the left buttock and in several left inguinal lymph nodes. Following complete resection and lymph node dissection the patient developed widespread leukoderma. To our knowledge this is the first report of malignant melanoma arising in a common blue nevus. The literature on SCLE and leukoderma in the setting of melanoma is reviewed.","title":"Metastatic malignant melanoma arising from a common blue nevus in a patient with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.","pubmedId":"2656327"}
