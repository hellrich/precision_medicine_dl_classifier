However, the stability of this clustering over the course of childhood has yet to be determined. The purpose of this study was to determine the tracking of clustered CVD risk from young school age through adolescence and to examine differences in tracking between levels of overweight/obesity and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO(2peak)).\nBeginning at 6 y, children (n \u003d 434) were measured three times in 7 y. Anthropometrics, blood pressure, and VO(2peak) were measured. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for CVD risk factors. A clustered risk score (z-score) was constructed by adding sex-specific z-scores for blood pressure, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), triglyceride (TG), skinfolds, and negative values of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and VO(2peak).\nSignificant tracking coefficients were found between clustered z-score at all time intervals (r \u003d 0.514, 0.559, and 0.381 between ages 6-9, 9-13, and 6-13 y, respectively, all P \u003c 0.0001). Tracking was higher for low-fit children, whereas no clear pattern was found for different levels of body fat.\nWe found that clustered z-score is a fairly stable characteristic through childhood. Implementation of preventive strategies could therefore start at early school age.","title":"Tracking of clustered cardiovascular disease risk factors from childhood to adolescence.","pubmedId":"23165452"}
