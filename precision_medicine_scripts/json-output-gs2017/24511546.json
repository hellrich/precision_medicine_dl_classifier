The parotid gland is the most common location. Its molecular genetic characteristics remain largely unknown. We have previously reported high incidence of PIK3CA somatic mutations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in pharyngeal cancers. Here we examined the PIK3CA gene expression status and hotspot mutations in six cases of SDC by immunohistochemistry and genomic DNA sequencing. Immunohistochemistry showed that PIK3CA expression was elevated in all six patients with SDC. By DNA sequencing, two hotspot mutations of the PIK3CA gene, E545K (exon 9) and H1047R (exon 20), were identified in two of the six cases. Our results support that oncogenic PIK3CA is upregulated and frequently mutated in human SDC, adding evidence that PIK3CA oncogenic pathway is critical in the tumorigenesis of SDC, and may be a plausible drug target for this rare disease.
