Positive signals were shown in cytoplasma and cell membrane.\nOf 122 GISTs, 118 (97%) were positive for c-kit. Localization of positive signals was accurate. The rate of c-kit protein in benign, potentially malignant and malignant cases was 98% (53/54), 93% (12/13), 96% (53/55) respectively. Compared with benign GIST, the positivity of c-kit in metastasis or recurrent cases decreased, but c-kit protein expression rate was not significantly different between the three patterns of GIST (chi(2) \u003d 1.167, P \u003e 0.05). Leiomyomas and schwannomas were typically c-kit negative.\nAs a sensitive and specific marker of GIST, c-kit seems to be a useful antibody in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of GIST, but it may not be used as a prognostic index.","title":"[Expression and clinical significance of c-kit oncogene in gastrointestinal stromal tumors].","pubmedId":"12133359"}
