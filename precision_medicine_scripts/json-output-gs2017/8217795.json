Using in vitro DNA amplification followed by oligonucleotide hybridization analysis, 45 AML and six MDS patients were screened for activating mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 of N-ras. Ten of them (eight AML and two MDS) were found positive. These 10 patients and 10 others without activating N-ras mutation were further analysed by direct sequencing of the amplified exons for p53 mutations and for atypical N-ras mutations. Beside the activating mutations in the N-ras gene, no additional transforming or nontransforming mutations could be detected in the N-ras. However, exon 7 of p53 was mutated in two AML patients without activating N-ras mutation. These data show that p53 mutations occurred with half the frequency of N-ras mutations in AML and that no positive correlation could be found between the onset of mutations in N-ras and p53 genes.","title":"Occurrence of point mutations in p53 gene is not increased in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia carrying an activating N-ras mutation.","pubmedId":"8217795"}
