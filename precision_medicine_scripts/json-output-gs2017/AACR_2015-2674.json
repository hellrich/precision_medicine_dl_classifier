Here, we report on the activity, mode of action and biomarker analysis of BAY1082439, a balanced PI3K/ inhibitor, in cell lines and xenografts from Asian and Caucasian gastric cancer patients.Methods: Twenty cell lines were screened in vitro for the sensitivity to BAY1082439 using cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion assays. In vivo activity and mode of action of BAY 1082439 were further assessed by pathway inhibition, tumor growth inhibition, and effects on tumor stromal cells. Molecular features were assessed by Oncocarta analysis, gene expression arrays, and immunohistochemistry.Results: Seven cell lines were sensitive to BAY1082439, which included 6/7 cell lines with PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss. In vivo study with 15 PDX and 2 cell line models revealed that tumors with genetic alteration of PIK3CA and PIK3CB, PTEN-loss, and/or HER2/HER3/FGFR overexpression were more sensitive to BAY 1082439 (tumor growth inhibition \u003e90%), while tumors harboring KRAS mutation and/or overexpressing EGFR were insensitive or less responsive to BAY 1082439. Interestingly, BAY1082439 did not inhibit proliferation of MKN45 cells in-vitro (IC50\u003e10M), however it induced tumor stasis in this highly vascularized MKN45 xenografts. The anti-angiogenic activity BAY 1082439 was also demonstrated in patient derived gastric cancer models assessed by CD31 immunohistochemistry. BAY1082439 was also active in many tumors resistant to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Synergistic or additive effects on tumor growth and apoptosis were observed for BAY1082439 in combination with paclitaxel, 5-FU, and capecitabine/oxaliplatin.Conclusions: The PI3K/ balanced inhibitor BAY1082439 showed considerable anti-tumor activity including tumor regression in gastric cancer models with genetic alteration or activation of PI3K/ and/or PI3K/ as single agent or in combination.","title":"Activity of BAY1082439, a balanced PI3K/ inhibitor, in gastric cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2674"}
