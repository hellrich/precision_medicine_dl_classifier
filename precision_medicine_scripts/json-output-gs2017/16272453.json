In stage III patients, there has been a steady improvement in 3-year disease-free survival with the use of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) regimens and capecitabine (Xeloda); Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ, http://www.rocheusa.com) regimens. A median survival longer than 20 months was observed in patients with metastatic disease when treated with combination chemotherapy containing oxaliplatin (Eloxatin); Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc., New York, http://www.sanofi-synthelabo.us) or irinotecan (Camptosar); Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, New York, http://www.pfizer.com). This has led to 5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin becoming standard therapy, along with 5-FU/LV/irinotecan. New data confirm the beneficial effect on disease-free survival of adding oxaliplatin to adjuvant colorectal cancer regimens based on 5-FU. These regimens show an effect when given in bolus as well as in infusional schedules. Interest in future adjuvant regimens focuses on the potential additional benefit of molecularly targeted agents, such as bevacizumab (Avastin); Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, http://www.gene.com), and on the ability of applied genomics to distinguish between high- and low-risk populations.","title":"Rapid evolution in colorectal cancer: therapy now and over the next five years.","pubmedId":"16272453"}
