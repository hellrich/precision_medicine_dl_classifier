Moreover, several molecular markers, such as microsatellite instability (MSI) and BRAF, have been widely investigated as prognostic factors. Recently a high stroma component (EMT+ subtypes) has also been associated with poor outcome. The aim of the study is to analyze the prognostic value of MSI, BRAF and tumor-stroma ratio in a prospective series of stage II CC patients.  Methods:  FFPE tissue from 432 stage II CC patients operated at Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge (1996 - 2006) were included in the study. MSI status was assessed by the analysis of 5 mononucleotide repeat markers (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24 and MONO-27). BRAF V600E mutation was analyzed by single strand conformation polymorphism technique. Tumor-stroma ratio was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Associations between molecular factors and clinical features were assessed by Chi-Squared (X2) tests. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the Relapse Free (RFS) and the Colon Cancer specific Survival.  Results:  MSI status could be determined in 350 patients. 48 (14%) had MSI high (MSI-H) tumor. BRAF status could be assessed in 380 cases. 58 (15%) cases were BRAF mutated. Tumor-stroma ratio was analyzed in 407 tumor samples. 176 (43%) tumors had more than 50% intra-tumor stroma and were classified as stroma-high.  MSI-H tumors were significantly located in right colon (X2 p-value \u003d 1.03e-5), were poorly differentiated (X2 p-value \u003d 0.003) and had more than 12 lymph nodes resected (X2 p-value \u003d 0.037). MSI-H tumors were associated with BRAF mutation (X2 p-value \u003d 0.02) and stroma-low (X2 p-value \u003d 0.0005). When a molecular prognostic risk classification was performed, patients with MSI-H /stroma-low suggested a low risk of relapse comparing to MSI-H/stroma-high, microsatellite stable (MSS)/stroma-low and MSS/stroma-high patients (HR \u003d 3.15; 95 CI, 0.76  13.1, p-value \u003d 0.0602).  Conclusions:   MSI-H tumors have BRAF mutation as well as low intra-tumor stroma.  Our results suggest that tumor-stroma ratio can explain differential prognosis in MSI-H stage II tumors.","title":"Prognostic biomarkers in a series of stage II colon cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_116614-132"}
