How to choose the sensitive patients and improve the effect was difficulty in clinic. This study was to assess the correlation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and HER2/3 protein expression with the effect of gefitinib on Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC.\nFrom May 2002 to February 2005, a total of 106 Chinese NSCLC patients who had failed at least one chemotherapy regimen were treated with gefitinib 250 mg once a day. The mutations in the exons 18-24 of EGFR gene were detected in the tumor tissues from 106 patients before the treatment of gefitinib, and HER2/3 expression in 84 tumor samples were detected by immunohistochemistry.\nMutation was identified in 32 (30.2%) tumor tissues. Overall remission rate was significantly higher in the HER2 high expression patients than in the HER2 low expression patients (36.8% vs 17.4%, P\u003d0.044). HER2 and HER3 expression levels were not associated with time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). The patients with HER2/3 single high expression had relatively longer TTP and OS than those with HER2/3 single low expression (6.1 vs 9.1 months, P\u003d0.725; 6.1 vs 9.0 months, P\u003d0.862), while those with concomitant HER2/3 high expression had significant longer TTP and OS. EGFR-mutated patients with HER2 expression or high HER2 and HER3 expressions were more sensitive to gefitinib.\nEGFR mutations combined with HER2/3 expressions is a significant predictor for gefitinib efficacy on Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC.","title":"[Correlation of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and HER2/3 protein expression with clinical outcome in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib].","pubmedId":"20038315"}
