Pancreatology, 2001;1(5):466-471). OtherBRCA-associated cancers have demonstrated increased sensitivity toplatinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors (PARPi) with improvedclinical outcomes compared to sporadic cases (J Clin Oncol, 2008 Dec1;26(34):5530-6). Outcomes in BRCA-associated pancreatic cancer areunknown. Methods: Patientswith a known BRCA1 or -2 mutation and a diagnosis of PAC wereretrospectively identified from the MSKCC Familial Pancreas CancerRegistry and via institutional database review. Outcomes and clinicalcharacteristics were reviewed. 7 patients (1 male) with BRCA2 mutationand PAC, 4 patients (1 male) with BRCA1 mutation and PAC, wereidentified. Two further cases of BRCA mutation and cholangiocarcinomawere identified. Results: SeeTable for patient demographics. Treatment for advanced disease includeda PARP inhibitor (PARPi) in 2 cases; both pts had a radiologic partialresponse (PR) to therapy. Five patients received platinum-basedchemotherapy for advanced disease, 4 of whom had a PR. Median survivalfor all patients was 27.6 months. Conclusions:The use of platinum- containingchemotherapy, radiation therapy, and PARPi to target theBRCA-associated defective DNA repair mechanism is deserving of furtherinvestigation in these patients. PARPi have demonstrated promisingefficacy in patients with BRCA-mutatedbreast and ovarian cancer and are undergoing prospective evaluation inPAC. Genetic testing in patients presenting with a personal history orstrong family history of BRCA associated cancers may help to guidechoice of therapy.BRCAand PAC(n\u003d11)BRCAand biliary ca(n\u003d2)Medianage at diagnosis60yrs50yrs, 87 yrsGenderMale:2 pts (18%)Female: 9 pts (82%)Femalex 2Priorbreast cancer6pts (55%)NoTumorlocationHead:6 pts (55%)Body: 2 pts (18%) Tail: 3 pts (27%)N/AStageat diagnosisOperable:3 pts (27%)Locally advanced: 2 pts (18%)Metastatic: 6 pts (55%)Operable2 ptsBRCAmutationBRCA1:4 pts (36%)BRCA2: 7 pts (64%)BRCA2:2 pts","title":"Clinical outcomes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) associated with a known BRCA mutation.","pubmedId":"ASCO_71222-103"}
