Tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors (TKIs) are already in clinical use. The aims of this study were to examine the gene copy number and expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in 155 patients with PDAC, and investigate the effects of the FGFR-specific inhibitor BGJ398 on FGFR1-amplified pancreatic tumour cells in vitro.\nFluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemical analysis of 155 PDACs were performed using tissue microarrays. Amplification of FGFR1 was found in 2.6% (4/155) of cases. Four per cent of tumours (5/125) were shown to express FGFR1 by immunohistochemistry. Sequence analysis demonstrated an activating KRAS mutation (exon 2) in all FGFR1-amplified cases. The FGFR1-amplified pancreatic carcinoma cell line PT45P1 showed high levels of FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression. Proliferation of this cell line can be inhibited using the FGFR1 inhibitor BGJ398.\nFGFR1 represents a potential new therapeutic target in a subset of patients harbouring FGFR1-amplified tumours. Identification of pancreatic cancers harbouring FGFR1 amplification may be important in preselecting patients and/or interpreting clinical studies using TKIs.","title":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene amplification in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23808822"}
