A single 640 base-pair Eco RI--Hind III fragment of the transforming gene, isolated by DNA transfection and molecular cloning, can detect a single Eco RI fragment (2.9 kilobase pairs) of DNA from phenotypically normal cells. The data suggest a constant chromosomal location of c-Ki-ras2.","title":"Human c-Ki-ras2 proto-oncogene on chromosome 12.","pubmedId":"6823569"}
