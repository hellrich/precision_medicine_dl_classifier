To better define the role of PALB2 in breast cancer susceptibility in Italian breast or breast-ovarian cancer families we screened 95 index cases negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations. The mutational analysis of the PALB2 gene in a index case of an high risk breast cancer family, has identified a frameshift mutation (c.1517delG) in the exon 4 that leads to the formation of a stop codon, 12 residues downstream of the mutation (Leu451X). The mutation was identified in a woman 52 year old with an infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma and in two of the three sisters without breast cancer. Our results confirmed that PALB2 could be a susceptibility gene for familial breast cancer also in Italian population.","title":"PALB2: a novel inactivating mutation in a Italian breast cancer family.","pubmedId":"20852946"}
