In this work, we altered the levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors, individually and in combination, by using 6-finger and 12-finger synthetic zinc finger protein artificial transcription factors (ATFs) in an epidermoid squamous cell carcinoma line, A431. We successfully designed 12-finger ATFs capable of coregulating ErbB3 and ICAM-1 or ErbB2 and ErbB3. With ATFs, the effects of changes in ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptor levels were evaluated by using cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell signaling assays. Cell proliferation was increased when ErbB2 and ErbB3 were both overexpressed. Cell migration on collagen was decreased when ErbB2 was down-regulated, yet migration on laminin was significantly increased with ErbB3 overexpression. ErbB2 and ErbB3 overexpression also stimulated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Our ATF approach has elucidated differences in ErbB receptor-mediated proliferation, migration, and intracellular signaling that cannot be explained merely by the presence or absence of particular ErbB receptors and emphasizes the dynamic nature of the ErbB signaling system. The transcription factor approach developed here provides a gene-economical route to the regulation of multiple genes and may be important for complex gene therapies.","title":"Zinc finger transcription factors designed for bispecific coregulation of ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors: insights into ErbB receptor biology.","pubmedId":"16199884"}
