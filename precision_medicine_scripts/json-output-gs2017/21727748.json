We describe a 13-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus who presented with hepatomegaly and severe transaminase flares. Liver histology confirmed GH. Treatment consists of improving glycemic control. Hepatomegaly due to excess glycogen storage in poorly controlled type 1 diabetics has been associated with younger patients with poor glycemic control, occurring about 2-4 weeks after starting insulin treatment, and resolving upon glucose stabilization. We conclude that glycogenic hepatopathy can cause hepatomegaly and significant transaminase elevations in individuals with type I diabetes mellitus, The recovery of severe transaminase elevations in this patient illustrates the more benign course of GH, which is a condition with a far better prognosis. Clinician awareness of GH should prevent diagnostic delay and will provide better insight into the prevalence of GH.","title":"Glycogen hepatopathy in a 13-year-old male with type 1 diabetes.","pubmedId":"21727748"}
