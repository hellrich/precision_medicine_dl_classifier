We conducted a prospective multicenter study to determine the feasibility of atDNA genotyping on a Next-Generation Sequencing (NSG) platform and ctDNA genotyping among patients with advanced solid malignancies. ctDNA genotyping was concurrently performed and variables associated with Con were investigated. Methods: Patients at 5 BC Cancer Agency Centers were enrolled over 14 months. atDNA genotype was performed using NSG and high-throughput multiplex amplification of a 27 gene panel (Raindance). ctDNA genotyping was done with Boreal Genomics OnTarget on 4cc plasma from blood collected in Streck tubes processed within 96 hours. Con was determined in clinical gene subsets for Colorectal (CR) (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF), Lung (L) (EGFR, KRAS) and Melanoma (M)(BRAF). Results: Of 300 patients, tumor origin was CR (46%), L (28%), M (M) (7.7%), and Other (18%). The number of metastatic sites was 1 in 39% and \u003e1 in 54% and 64% had resected primary tumors. 50% of patients had received systemic or radiation therapy within 3 months (median 18 d of ctDNA) and 48% had 1 elevated tumor marker. In multivariate analysis, higher Con was seen in CR compared to L (OR 2.5; 95%CI 1.2, 5.2) and when time between atDNA and ctDNA was 1 year versus \u003e1 year (OR 2.4; 95%CI 1.03, 5.5). Con was not affected by # or type of metastasis, receipt of prior therapy, resection of the primary tumor or elevated tumour marker. ctDNA analysis was completed on the initial 181 cases. Conclusions: Concordance between atDNA and ctDNA was lower in L cancer and higher concordance was associated with shorter time interval between surgical and liquid biopsy. It was not associated with extent of metastatic disease and other measured variables. Discordance was more frequently related to variants not found in ctDNA. Updated results for the full cohort will be presented.
