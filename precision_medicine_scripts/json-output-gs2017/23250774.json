Because there is presently no cure for cancer, the best strategy to combat oncological diseases is through early detection and prevention. The methods currently available are vaccines to target specific viruses (primary prevention), in combination with screening (secondary prevention), use of biomarkers, and administration of adjuvant therapy (tertiary prevention). Modifiable lifestyle-related risk factors are also important in cancer prevention. Vaccination has been proven to be highly effective against targeted diseases leading to the development of cancer, particularly if the vaccination is given in the early years of life. The need for regular screening (for breast cancer, cervical cancer, etc.) should not be neglected and should be followed to detect unusual changes or abnormalities in the body. With discoveries as targeted therapies, adjuvant treatment becomes a secure component of tertiary prevention in the betterment of disease management. The discovery of biomarkers and subsequent targeted therapies has led to personalized medicine as the current trend in cancer care.","title":"Prevention of oncological diseases: primary and secondary prevention.","pubmedId":"23250774"}
