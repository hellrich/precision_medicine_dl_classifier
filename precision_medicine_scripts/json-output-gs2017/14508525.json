Recent studies have reported that mutations of the BRAF gene were detected with varying frequencies in several cancers, notably more than 60% in melanoma. We analysed mutations of BRAF and RAS genes in 100 cases of thyroid carcinoma to investigate genetic aberrations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAP kinase pathway. BRAF mutations were detected exclusively in papillary carcinomas (40 in 76 cases: 53%), and were exclusively V599E, a mutation frequently observed in other carcinomas. NRAS mutation was observed in six cases (6%), all in histological types other than papillary carcinoma, and was exclusively Q61R. No mutations were found in KRAS or HRAS. Our results suggest that BRAF mutations may play a critical role in the carcinogenesis of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.","title":"BRAF mutations in papillary carcinomas of the thyroid.","pubmedId":"14508525"}
