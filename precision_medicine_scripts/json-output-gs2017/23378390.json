A 61-year-old woman who had a past history of ampullary carcinoma surgically treated two year previously, presented with symptoms of left visual disturbance and left hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance images demonstrated a right occipital lobe tumor with peritumoral edema and midline shift. Gross total resection was carried out. Pathological diagnosis was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with compartments of signet-ring cell carcinoma. Metastases outside the abdominal cavity are rare. Brain metastases from ampullary carcinomas are extremely rare and there are few reports about such cases.","title":"[A brain metastasis from ampullary carcinoma: a case report].","pubmedId":"23378390"}
