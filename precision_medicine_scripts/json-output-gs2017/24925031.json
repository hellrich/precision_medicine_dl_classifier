Identification and characterization of pancreatic cancer stem cells may aid our ability to improve diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Novel approaches are necessary for the earlier diagnosis of pancreatic cancer as well as improved treatment to prevent distal metastasis. Key markers for the identification of pancreatic cancer stem cells include CD133, ALDH, side population cells and the triplet combination CD44+ CD24+ESA+. The roles of these proteins as markers for stemness in pancreatic cancer as well as recent studies with the c-Met proto-oncogene will be discussed. The ability of these markers to predict survival of pancreatic cancer patients is being examined clinically. Stemness and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be linked. Expression of some of these markers may be associated with distant metastasis. Treatment of pancreatic cancer patients by targeting the pancreatic cancer stem cells holds promise.
