Immunohistochemical staining for p53, pRb, p16, and cyclin D1 was performed on a tissue microarray from 103 patients with urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical cystectomy. Of the patient samples analyzed, 36 (35%), 61 (59%), 47 (46%) and 30 (29%) had altered expression of p53, pRb, p16, and cyclin D1, respectively. Abnormal expression of p53 and pRb correlated with depth of invasion (P\u003d0.040 and P\u003d0.044, respectively). Cyclin D1 expression was associated with tumor stage and recurrence (P\u003d0.017 and P\u003d0.036, respectively). Altered pRb was significantly correlated with overall survival (P\u003d0.040). According to the expression pattern of pRb and p53, p53/pRb (altered/normal) had worse survival than p53/pRb (normal/altered) (P\u003d0.022). Alteration of all markers had worse survival than all normal (P\u003d0.029). As determined by multivariate analysis, tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and the combined expression of p53 and pRb are independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, immunohistochemical evaluation of cell cycle regulators, especially the p53/pRb combination, might be useful in planning appropriate treatment strategies.","title":"Expression of pRb, p53, p16 and cyclin D1 and their clinical implications in urothelial carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20890425"}
