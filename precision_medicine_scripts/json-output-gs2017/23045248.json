C-07 tested the worth of adding oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin, and C-08 tested the worth of adding bevacizumab to FOLFOX. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess prognostic or oxaliplatin predictive value of mutations for tumor recurrence, overall survival (OS), and survival after recurrence (SAR).\nBRAF mutations were associated with MMR-deficient tumors (P \u003c 0.0001), poor OS [HR, 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.20-1.79; P â‰¤ 0.0002], and poor SAR (HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.83-2.95; P \u003c 0.0001). Mutations in KRAS, NRAS, MET, and PIK3CA were not associated with recurrence, OS, or SAR. MMR-deficient tumors were associated with an improved prognosis based on recurrence (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33-0.70; P \u003c 0.0001). Mutations and MMR status were not predictive for oxaliplatin benefit.\nThis study shows that BRAF mutations profiled from stage II and III colon cancer tumors were associated with poor SAR and validates and explains, at least in part, previous observations associating it with poor OS. Profiling of all of these mutations is warranted for future clinical trials testing new targeted therapies that block relevant signaling pathways. Such clinical trials are under development at NSABP.","title":"Mutation profiling and microsatellite instability in stage II and III colon cancer: an assessment of their prognostic and oxaliplatin predictive value.","pubmedId":"23045248"}
