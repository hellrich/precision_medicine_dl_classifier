To identify rational co-targeting strategies to enhance clinical outcomes, we explored the molecular basis of ALK oncogene dependence in ALK gene rearrangement positive (ALK+) lung adenocarcinoma. We discovered that the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is the critical downstream pathway necessary for ALK+ tumor cell survival. Upfront co-targeting of ALK plus MEK enhanced response and forestalled resistance in preclinical ALK+ tumor models, providing rationale for a new approach the treatment of ALK+ patients.
