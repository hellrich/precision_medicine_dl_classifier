They have the potential to be new targets for the diagnosis and therapeutics in several different types of cancers. To identify fusion genes in gastric cancer, we conducted RNA sequencing with 18 gastric cancer cell lines and 11 pairs of primary human gastric cancer tissues and their adjacent normal tissues. We identified PPP1R1B-STARD3 fusion gene and validated the expression of this fusion gene by Real-Time PCR in the expanded panel of the human gastric tissue samples. Interestingly, PPP1R1B-STRAD3 fusion gene was detected in approximately 30% of primary human gastric cancers, but not in adjacent matched normal gastric tissues. Overexpression of PPP1R1B-STARD3 in MKN-28 significantly increased cell proliferation and colony formation. This increased proliferation was mediated by activation of PI3K/Akt signaling. To confirm if the expression of PPP1R1B-STARD3 fusion gene affects the tumorigenic capacity of gastric cancer cells in vivo, we performed the xenograft assay with MKN-28 cells that stably express PPP1R1B-STARD3 fusion gene. Overexpression of the fusion gene enhanced the MKN-28 tumor growth in nude mice. Hence, PPP1R1B-STARD3 fusion gene overexpression gives growth advantage in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicate that PPP1R1B-STRAD3 fusion gene increased cell proliferation through the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in gastric cancer cells.","title":"PPP1R1B-STARD3 fusion gene promotes gastric tumorigenesis through activation of PI3K/Akt signaling.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-4304"}
