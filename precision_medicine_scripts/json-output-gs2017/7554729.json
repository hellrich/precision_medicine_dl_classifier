In case of 3rd nerve involvement, usually unilateral extra ocular muscles are affected. However, ptosis is very rare in patients with diabetic neuropathy. In this report, we describe bilateral ptosis with ophthalmoplegia in diabetes. In ophthalmoplegia associated with diabetes, ischemic nerve infarction was reported. We treated this patient with Lipo prostaglandin (PG) E1. Since then, increased platelet aggregation activity was found in this patient. After two months, the symptoms of this patient were improved.","title":"Bilateral ptosis with ophthalmoplegia in a 72-year-old woman with diabetes.","pubmedId":"7554729"}
