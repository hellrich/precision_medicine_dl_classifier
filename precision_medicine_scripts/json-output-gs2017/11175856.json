Similarly, the extent to which established mammary tumors remain dependent on individual mutations for maintenance of the transformed state is unknown. Here we use the tetracycline regulatory system to conditionally express the human c-MYC oncogene in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice. MYC encodes a transcription factor implicated in multiple human cancers. In particular, amplification and overexpression of c-MYC in human breast cancers is associated with poor prognosis, although the genetic mechanisms by which c-MYC promotes tumor progression are poorly understood. We show that deregulated c-MYC expression in this inducible system results in the formation of invasive mammary adenocarcinomas, many of which fully regress following c-MYC deinduction. Approximately half of these tumors harbor spontaneous activating point mutations in the ras family of proto-oncogenes with a strong preference for Kras2 compared with Hras1. Nearly all tumors lacking activating ras mutations fully regressed following c-MYC deinduction, whereas tumors bearing ras mutations did not, suggesting that secondary mutations in ras contribute to tumor progression. These findings demonstrate that c-MYC-induced mammary tumorigenesis proceeds through a preferred secondary oncogenic pathway involving Kras2.","title":"c-MYC induces mammary tumorigenesis by means of a preferred pathway involving spontaneous Kras2 mutations.","pubmedId":"11175856"}
