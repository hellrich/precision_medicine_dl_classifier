Of 833 breast cancer patients (T1-T2, N0) who underwent SLN biopsy and had their SLNs examined intra-operatively with the OSNA assay, 161 with SLN metastasis and treated with completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) were randomly divided into a training (n \u003d 81) and a validation (n \u003d 80) cohort. Non-SLN metastasis of the training cohort was associated with the number of positive SLNs (P \u003d 0.001), CK19 mRNA copy number (P \u003d 0.001), and clinical tumor size (P \u003d 0.055). These parameters were used to construct the intra-operative prediction model of non-SLN metastasis. Its diagnostic accuracy (AUC of ROC curve) was 0.809 and 0.704 for the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The intra-operative prediction model using OSNA may have a diagnostic accuracy of non-SLN metastasis comparable to that of the conventional, post-operative prediction model, indicating that it might help decide the indication for cALND.","title":"One-step nucleic acid amplification assay for intraoperative prediction of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis.","pubmedId":"24973902"}
