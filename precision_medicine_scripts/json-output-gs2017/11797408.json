The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference of benefit between lobectomy and limited resection at second lung resection. Forty-eight patients, who had already undergone lobectomy due to primary lung cancer, undergoing second lobectomy (n \u003d 30) or limited resection (n \u003d 18) for metachronous lung cancer were investigated. The over-all 5-year survival rate of second operation was 51.9%. Although there was no significant difference of 5-year survival rates between lobectomy and limited resection, 50.4% and 49.4%, respectively, lobectomy for T1N0 subset prolonged the survival compared to limited resection, 5-year survival rates, 69.6% and 31.7%, respectively. However, lobectomy resulted in more postoperative complications and less preservation of lung function. Lobectomy should be considered the surgical procedure of choice for patients with metachronous T1N0 lung cancer when lung function is preserved.","title":"[Metachronous lung cancer: indication and outcome].","pubmedId":"11797408"}
