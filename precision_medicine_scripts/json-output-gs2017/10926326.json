According to the 1993 WHO criteria, revised by Perry et al., the 69 meningiomas were classified into: grade I \u003d 54 benign meningiomas, grade II \u003d 10 atypical meningiomas, grade III \u003d 5 malignant meningiomas. The patients were followed until death or for an average of 6.7 years. The 69 meningiomas were divided into two groups, according to the absence (n \u003d 42) or presence (n \u003d 27) of recurrences. In the last group we included 3 patients who died of meningioma recurrence. According to the percentage of MIB-1 positively stained cells, meningiomas were divided into three groups: \u003c1% (n \u003d 36), 1-10% (n \u003d 28), \u003e10% (n \u003d 5). We found the MIB-1 labeling index (LI) \u003c1% in 33 grade I (61%) and in 3 grade II (30%) meningiomas. On the other hand, 7 grade II (70%) and all grade III (100%) meningiomas presented a MIB-1 LI \u003e1%. Correlation between histological grade and MIB-1 LI was statistically significant (p \u003d 0.0006). The correlation between MIB-1 LI and follow-up was also highly significant (p \u003c 0.001): the majority of meningiomas which did not recur (32/42 equal to 76%) were characterized by a low (\u003c1%) MIB-1 LI. In the recurrence group MIB-1 LI was significantly higher than in the disease-free patients\u0027 group. Moreover, MIB-1 appeared to be a prognostic parameter not strongly related to the histological grade. In fact, it was significantly higher in recurrent histologically benign meningiomas, as compared with benign meningiomas without recurrence (p \u003d 0.0006). Positive p53 protein expression (\u003e1%) was shown in 26/45 meningiomas (57%), with an LI of 1-10% in 18 (40%) and an LI of \u003e10% in 8 (17%) meningiomas. Although the p53 LI tended to be higher in atypical and malignant meningiomas, no significant correlation was found between the p53 expression and the recurrence (p \u003d 0.05). The authors conclude that quantitative MIB-1 labeling is a useful technique in the routine diagnostic assessment of meningiomas, and helpful in obtaining more information about prognosis and thereby in planning the most suitable treatment.","title":"Correlation between histological grade, MIB-1, p53, and recurrence in 69 completely resected primary intracranial meningiomas with a 6 year mean follow-up.","pubmedId":"10926326"}
