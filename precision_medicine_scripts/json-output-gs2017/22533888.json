These are rare mesenchymatous tumours, while they represent the most common mesenchymal tumours of the alimentary tract. The majority of GISTs develop in the stomach and small intestine and more rarely in the rectum, colon, esophagus and mesentery; only 3-5% of all GISTs are located in the duodenum. The presenting symptoms include early satiation, dysphagia, bloating, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding, either acute or chronic. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for localized, non-metastatic, resectable GISTs. We present a case of duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumour of the third portion of the duodenum that presented with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding treated with segmental duodenal resection.","title":"Duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding treated with segmental resection.","pubmedId":"22533888"}
