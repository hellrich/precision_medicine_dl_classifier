Our purpose is to develop the new treatment for EGFR-TKI resistance. Methods: We used PC9 human lung cancer cell line harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion (E746-A750). When PC9 cells were cultured with 2 M gefitinib solved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), most of cells died and surviving cells proliferated slowly. By 90 days-culture with 2 M gefitinib, PC9 gefitinib resistant cells (PC9GR90) were established and confirmed that EGFR-T790M resistance-related mutation was negative. In PC9GR90, an immunoblot assay revealed MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) amplification and alternative EGFR3 tyrosine phosphorylation, which is known as one of the major resistant mechanisms. Results: When PC9GR90 were cultured with 2 M gefitinib and one inhibitor (histone deacetylase inhibitor, insulin-like growth factor receptor inhibitor, gamma secretase inhibitor, or imatinib known as bcr-abl, c-kit and platelet derived growth factor receptor inhibitor), 10 M imatinib treatment with gefitinib showed significant suppression of cell growth. The ratio of cell count of 2 M gefitinib/DMSO and 10 M imatinib with 2 M gefitinib/DMSO were 91.7% and 6.0%, respectively. When imatinib concentration was decreased to 1 M known as appropriate concentration for chronic myeloid leukemia treatment, there was no effect. The imatinib effect was not shown for NCI-H1975 lung cancer cells harboring both EGFR-L858R and -T790M. By immunoblot, we found EGFR3 phosphorylation was inhibited by imatinib treatment. Conclusion: It is the first report that imatinib inhibits EGFR3 phophorylation and induce cell death in the EGFR-TKI resistant lung cancer with MET amplification and EGFR3 phophorylation. Although further studies are required to apply this strategy to a clinical setting, we demonstrate a hopeful data to conquer one important resistant mechanism.","title":"Imatinib treatment for gefitinib-resistant lung cancer harboring epidermal growth factor receptor mutation","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1793"}
