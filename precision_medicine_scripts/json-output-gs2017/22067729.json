Semiquantitative scores of zero (no staining or staining in less than 10% of cancer cells), 1+, 2+, or 3+ were assigned to each sample based on the intensity of staining. Scores of 2+ or 3+ were defined as HER3-positive staining, i.e., HER3 overexpression.\nHER3 overexpression was observed in 52 of the 126 tissue samples (41.3%). There were no associations between HER3 overexpression and clinicopathological factors, including tumor location, tumor size, tumor differentiation, T/N categories according to the International Union against Cancer, and serum carbohydrate antibody 19-9 level (CA19-9). Univariate analysis demonstrated the median survival time of patients with HER3 overexpression was 37.2 months, while that of patients with HER3-negative samples was 58.6 months (p \u003d 0.008). HER3 overexpression, lymph node metastasis, and elevated serum CA19-9 level were independent predictors of poor prognosis based on multivariate survival analysis.\nA new prognostic predictor, HER3 overexpression, was identified for resected pancreatic cancer.","title":"HER3 overexpression as an independent indicator of poor prognosis for patients with curatively resected pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"22067729"}
