Cowden syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome associated with a germline PTEN mutation and increased risk of breast, thyroid, endometrial and colon cancer. In this report we present a case of a 14-year-old nulligravid female diagnosed with grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma. She subsequently developed fibrocystic breast disease and colon polyps and was diagnosed with Cowden syndrome at age 20. We therefore recommend formal evaluation for Cowden syndrome to be considered when endometrial cancer is diagnosed in adolescence.","title":"Endometrial cancer in a 14-year-old girl with Cowden syndrome: a case report.","pubmedId":"23279635"}
