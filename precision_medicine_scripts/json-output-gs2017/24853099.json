This study aimed to analyze the relationship of MET expression with tumor phenotype and clinical outcome in bladder cancer and the role of gene amplification for MET overexpression. A bladder cancer tissue microarray containing 686 bladder cancers was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and by fluorescence in situ hybridization. MET immunostaining was seen in normal urothelium and was recorded in 459 of 560 analyzable urothelial carcinomas (82.0%). Low MET staining was associated with a more unfavorable tumor phenotype. MET staining was seen in 89.8% of 266 pTa, 81.1% of 132 pT1, and 69.4% of 160 pT2-4 cancers (P \u003c 0.0001). MET staining was detectable in 92.4% of 66 grade 1, 85.6% of 257 grade 2, and 75.1% of 237 grade 3 cancers (P \u003d 0.001). MET expression status was not associated with overall or tumor-specific survival in muscle-invasive cancers (pT2-4), tumor progression in pT1 cancers, or recurrences in pTa tumors. Only four of the analyzed tumors (0.8%) showed amplification of the MET gene. We conclude that MET is not overexpressed in urothelial cancer but rather downregulated in a fraction of cancers. Accordingly, rare amplification of the genomic area including the MET gene was not associated with MET protein overexpression.
