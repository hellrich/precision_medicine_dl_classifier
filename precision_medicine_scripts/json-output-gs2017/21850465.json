The low dialysis clearance, accounting for a minor part of the total body clearance and the absence of detectable trabectedin in the dialysate samples, suggests that hemodialysis does not efficiently clear trabectedin. Trabectedin tolerance was good.\nThis case reports for the first time the feasibility of trabectedin therapy in a hemodialyzed patient. Given the rising incidence of cancer in patients with end-stage renal disease, it is crucial to provide data that improve the management of anticancer drugs in dialyzed patients.","title":"Pharmacokinetics of trabectedin on hemodialysis: an application for the management of cancer patients with end-stage renal disease.","pubmedId":"21850465"}
