Fifty-four per cent were females and 46 per cent males. The prevalence of congestive heart failure in the Internal Medicine Department was 4.8%. Between the ages of 15 and 44 years the hospital age-specific prevalence was between 16.1/10,000/year and 26.7/10,000/year for women and between 14.5/10,000/year and 16.1/10,000/year for men. For ages equal or greater than 75 years it was between 508.9/10,000/year and 561.3/10,000/year for women and between 300.2/10,000/year and 421.8/10,000/year for men. Possible causes of congestive heart failure were: valve disease in 26 per cent of patients, coronary artery disease in 24 per cent and hypertension in 20 per cent. The average case-fatality rate was 15.15% (female: 15.54%; male: 14.69%; chi 2 \u003d 0.36; p \u003e 0.55) evolving from 19.45% in 1989 to 12.59% in 1994 (chi 2 \u003d 6.85; p \u003c 0.01). Between the ages of 15 and 44 years the hospital cause-specific mortality rate was 16.2/100,000 and for ages equal or greater than 75 years it was 743.6/100,000. Stepwise logistic regression produced the following odds ratios for the variables significantly associated with dead during hospital admission: age (\u003e or \u003d 70 years)--1.48; infectious diseases--1.37; central nervous system diseases--2.28; chronic renal diseases--1.96; cardiac arrest--24.1; pulmonary embolism--2.26; acute renal failure--7.93; clinical signs of severe sodium and water retention--1.49; hyponatremia--3.39; other electrolyte abnormalities and acid-base balance disturbances--1.78. The simple linear regression of daily admissions on time produced a positive slope of 0.0002 (p \u003c 0.002).\nThe hospital prevalence of congestive heart failure is identical to other Western countries and is greater among the elderly patients. Valve disease, coronary artery disease and hypertension are the most frequent causes of congestive heart failure. An increasing trend in hospital admissions for congestive heart failure was observed. The hospital mortality was reduced in the last 6 years and was greater among the elderly patients. Age (\u003e or \u003d 70 years), the presence of comorbidity (infectious disease, central nervous system disease, acute renal failure, chronic renal disease and pulmonary embolism), hyponatremia, other electrolyte abnormalities and acid-base balance disturbances, resuscitated cardiac arrest and the presence of severe sodium and water retention have prognostic significance.","title":"[Epidemiologic features of congestive heart failure.
