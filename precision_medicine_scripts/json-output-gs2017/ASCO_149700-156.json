These genetic alterations are the targets of multiple approved therapies, preferentially inhibiting cancer cells while limiting damage to normal cells. Given the advances in the efficacy of targeted therapies, current guidelines recommend molecular testing of specific genes to match patients with targeted therapies for which there is clinical benefit. However, approximately one-third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients lack tissue samples for analysis and are not eligible for targeted therapies. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), shed into the blood from tumor tissue, contain alterations specific to the genetic profile of the malignancy in tissue and can stratify patients for targeted therapies through a liquid biopsy.  Methods:  We have developed LungSelect, a ctDNA approach to interrogate clinically actionable genetic alterations in NSCLC that are recommended by clinical guidelines or targeted in late stage clinical trials. LungSelect uses digital next-generation sequencing approaches to comprehensively examine single-base mutations, insertions and deletions in BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS and NRAS while assessing translocations in ALK, EGFR, NTRK1,RET and ROS1with a high degree of precision and accuracy.  Results:  To evaluate the analytical sensitivity of LungSelect, we examined well characterized somatic mutations through a combination of tumor derived DNA and wild-type derived DNA at various levels of tumor contribution, achieving a lower limit of detection of \u003e 0.01% with a specificity of \u003e 99.9%. In addition, we examined the utility of LungSelect to detect these genetic alterations in late-stage lung cancer patients through comparison of plasma and matched tissue biopsy specimens. These analyses revealed a high concordance between the genetic alterations identified in plasma and matched tissue biopsies.  Conclusions: LungSelect comprehensively detects genetic alterations non-invasively, allowing for a greater proportion of patients to obtain the survival benefit associated with targeted therapies in NSCLC.","title":"A comprehensive noninvasive approach for the stratification of lung cancer patients for targeted therapies.","pubmedId":"ASCO_149700-156"}
