These observations suggest that inhibition of B-Raf activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK cascade may be an effective approach for the treatment of RAS and B-RAF mutation-positive melanomas and colon carcinomas. Although recent studies with interfering RNA (RNAi) and pharmacologic inhibitors support a critical role for B-Raf signaling in melanoma growth, whether mutant B-Raf has an equivalent role in promoting colorectal carcinoma growth has not been determined. In the present study, we used both RNAi and pharmacologic approaches to further assess the role of B-Raf activation in the growth of human melanomas and additionally determined if a similar role for mutant B-Raf is seen for colorectal carcinoma cell lines. We observed that RNAi suppression of mutant B-Raf(V600E) expression strongly suppressed the anchorage-dependent growth of B-RAF mutation-positive melanoma, but not colorectal carcinoma, cells. However, the anchorage-independent and tumorigenic growth of B-RAF mutation-positive colorectal carcinomas was dependent on mutant B-Raf function. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition of MEK and Raf was highly effective at inhibiting the growth of B-RAF mutation-positive melanomas and colorectal carcinoma cells, whereas inhibitors of other protein kinases activated by Ras (AKT, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK) were less effective. Our observations suggest that Raf and MEK inhibitors may be effective for the treatment of B-RAF mutation-positive colorectal carcinomas as well as melanomas.","title":"Context-dependent roles of mutant B-Raf signaling in melanoma and colorectal carcinoma cell growth.","pubmedId":"17699719"}
