To elucidate the role of LKB1/STK11 in the carcinogenesis of primary and secondary human brain tumors, a total of 309 tumors were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at microsatellite loci D19S886, DI9S878, and D19S565. Low LOH rates were observed for glioma (17.3%, n \u003d 139), meningioma (5.3%, n \u003d 57), schwannoma (0%, n \u003d 21), pituitary adenoma (18.8%, n \u003d 16), primary CNS lymphoma, neuroblastoma, plasmocytoma, medulloblastoma, germinoma, and papilloma of the choroid plexus (6.6%, n \u003d 15). In contrast, brain metastases exhibited a mean LOH frequency of 42.6% (n \u003d 61), with breast (56.3%) and lung cancer metastases (58.3%) being most frequently affected. Genomic DNA sequencing of the complete coding region of LKB1/STK11 was performed in all brain metastases exhibiting LOH (n \u003d 26); no mutation was revealed, but we did find a germline mutation in a PJS patient. Despite high LOH fiequencies at the 19p13.3 locus in carcinoma metastases to the brain and occasional mutations reported for certain primary carcinomas, there are no mutations in LKB1/STK11. This fact suggests that alterations of LKB1/STK11 occur relatively early in tumorigenesis and are rarely involved in the development of carcinoma metastases. Based on these findings, the genes adjacent to LKB1/STK11 may be relevant for the development of metastases to the brain from certain carcinomas.","title":"Frequent loss of heterozygosity at the 19p13.3 locus without LKB1/STK11 mutations in human carcinoma metastases to the brain.","pubmedId":"11212897"}
