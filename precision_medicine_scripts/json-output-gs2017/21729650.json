This study was aimed to investigate efficacy of gefitinib for such population. The primary endpoint was response rate (RR) and at least 12 cases were needed. Overall RR was 59% (95% confidence interval, 33%-81%) and first-line gefitinib was effective for elderly patients.\nFeasibility of gefitinib therapy in elderly patients with non-small-cell lung cancer is uncertain. This phase II study aimed to investigate the efficacy and usefulness of gefitinib therapy as a first-line treatment for elderly patients who have advanced lung adenocarcinoma with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.\nWe enrolled chemotherapy-na√Øve advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients aged 75 years or older. Patients were administered gefitinib (250 mg) once daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was response rate (RR), and secondary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR; defined as complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR] plus stable disease [SD]), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity profile.\nBetween April 2008 and November 2009, 17 lung adenocarcinoma patients were enrolled. Overall RR was 59% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 33% to 81%), with 2 patients achieving CR and 8 PR. SD was noted in 5 patients, and DCR was 88% (95% CI: 62% to 98%). Median PFS was 12.9 months (95% CI: 2.2 to 23.6 months), and median OS had not yet been reached. Major grade 3 toxicities were skin rash (12%) and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase (18%).\nFirst-line treatment with gefitinib was effective and well-tolerated in elderly patients with EGFR mutations.","title":"Gefitinib as first-line treatment in elderly epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma: results of a Nagano Lung Cancer Research Group study.","pubmedId":"21729650"}
