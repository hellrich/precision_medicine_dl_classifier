All mutations segregated with disease where it was possible to check. Of the 14 families fulfilling BCLC criteria, 9 (64%) had mutations whilst only 3/16 (19%) of male breast cancer patients with less significant female breast cancer family history having a mutation. All 3 families with ovarian cancer and 3 families with multiple male breast cancer cases had BRCA2 mutations. These data are a further guide to how to prioritise samples for BRCA2 mutation analysis.","title":"High detection rate for BRCA2 mutations in male breast cancer families from North West England.","pubmedId":"14574168"}
