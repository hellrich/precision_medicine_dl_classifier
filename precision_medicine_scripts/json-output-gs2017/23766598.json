Most are associated with pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM). However, it can occur in patients without PBM.

Herein, we report a case of ampullary carcinoma associated with gall bladder carcinoma diagnosed nonoperatively and palliated with biliary metal stenting.","title":"Gall bladder carcinoma with ampullary carcinoma: a rare case of double malignancy.","pubmedId":"23766598"}
