LKB1 expression in normal cervical tissues and cervical cancers was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression profiles of cervical cancer HeLa cells stably expressing LKB1 were analyzed by microarray. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) terms and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) PATHWAY database. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate the microarray data. The expression of lipid phosphatase inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) was confirmed by western blotting.\nExpression of LKB1 inhibited HeLa cell proliferation, activated AMPK and was lost in more than 50% of cervical carcinomas. More than 200 genes were differentially expressed between HeLa cells with and without LKB1. Bioinformatics analysis with GO annotation indicated that LKB1 plays a role in receiving diverse stimuli and converting them into molecular signals. KEGG PATHWAY analysis showed that 8 pathways were significantly regulated. These include arginine and proline metabolism and inositol phosphate metabolism. The differential expression of 7 randomly selected genes was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, the steady-state level of INPP4B protein was up-regulated in LKB1-overexpressing cells.\nThis study establishes LKB1 as an important tumor suppressor in cervical cancer and sheds light on a novel signaling pathway regulated by LKB1.","title":"Expression and transcriptional profiling of the LKB1 tumor suppressor in cervical cancer cells.","pubmedId":"24792998"}
