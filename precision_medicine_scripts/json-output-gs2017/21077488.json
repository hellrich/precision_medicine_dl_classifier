Concurrent chemotherapy has become the mainstay of treatment and platinum remains the most effective single agent. Combinations of other agents have not demonstrated significant advantages. The application of angiogenesis inhibitors such as bevacizumab, an antibody inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor, in metastatic or advanced cervical cancer remains to be evaluated. We present the case of a patient with platinum-resistant recurrent cervical cancer treated with low-dose bevacizumab and carboplatin, with resultant improved disease progression and tolerable toxicity profiles.","title":"Chemotherapy with low-dose bevacizumab and carboplatin in the treatment of a patient with recurrent cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"21077488"}
