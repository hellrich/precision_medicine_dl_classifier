However, certain tumors may present with specific stromal changes that may assist/enhance the diagnosis. In this presentation, diagnostic stromal features have been reviewed. The cytoplasm is enclosed by a unit membrane, which serves as a barrier to, as well as an interface with, surrounding structures. Epithelial cells usually show characteristic basal-apical orientation. In mesenchymal tissue, different types of interface can be found in different types of mesenchymal tissue. External lamina can be defined as an anatomic structure, which encloses anatomic functional units. In epithelial tissue, cells in a functional unit are enclosed within a well-defined external lamina (EL). In malignant epithelial tumors, EL can become increasingly indistinct as tumors become less differentiated, and one has to look for it diligently. Within the external lamina, epithelial cells are closely packed with closely apposed cell membranes and cell attachment junctions. In contrast to epithelial tissue, mesenchymal tissue is usually characterized by the stromal elements they produce. Individual cells are embedded in the stroma, and individual mesenchymal cells represent the functional unit. Vascular endothelial cells are an exception since their relationship to stroma resembles to that of epithelial cells. Thus, tumors deriving from mesenchymal cells known to have external lamina such as muscle cells and Schwann cells tend to show total enclosure of cells by external lamina. In malignant muscle tumors, external lamina production can be focally present and found only by diligent search. In Schwann cell tumors, the presence of EL is prominent in low-grade tumors and more irregular and variable in malignant tumors. In the latter, stromal aggregation of scrolls of external lamina can be characteristic. Similar features are seen in ossifying fibromyxoid tumors. Fibronexus junctions (composed of extracellular fibronectin fillements linking intracellular 5-nm filaments) is claimed to be typical of myofbroblasts. Finding them in spindle cell tumors justifies a diagnosis of myofibroblastomas. There have been several stromal changes diagnostic for certain tumors found only by electron microscopy. Fibrous long-spaced collagen (known as Luse bodies) is diagnostic for peripheral nerve sheath tumors, but they can rarely be found in other tumors. Luse bodies usually appear as focally as crystallized aggregates apart from the regular collagenous interstitial stroma. They should be distinguished from other nonspecific long-spaced collagen changes. The changes are diffusely stromal in contrast to Luse bodies. Spiny collagen and amianthoid fibers are interesting collagen fibrils and their diagnostic value is questionable. Skeinoid fibers (SF) are short-spaced collagen of 41- to 45-nm banding so-named because of their peculiar appearance by electron microscopy simulating skeins of yarn. They were originally described in neurogenic tumors and small intestinal stromal tumors with features of gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumors (GANT). Although there have been a few sporadic case reports of the presence of skeinoid fibers in nonneurogenic tumors, the frequent presence of SF in spindle cell tumors signifies their neurogenic nature in this authors\u0027 experience. An exception to this is that SF can be a constant element of rare ciliary body tumors known as ciliary mesectodermal leiomyomas, in which tumor cells show some resemblance to smooth muscle as well as Schwann cells. In addition to SF, several other types of peculiar crystallized collagen were observed in GANT tumors, particularly those with multiple tumor syndromes such as neurofibromatosis and Carney\u0027s triad. They simulate the appearance of railroad tracks or centrosomes. The reason for this is not known. The authors speculate that such collagen crystallization may be caused by genetic alterations involving collagenosis. Further studies will be necessary to clarify their pathogenesis. Another peculiar stromal change is electron-dense stromal filamentous aggregates with extra-long banding of \u003e 250-nm periodicity previously described in Ewing sarcomas. This stromal change simulating a tiger skin pattern is also seen in primitive neuroectodermal tumors and malignant melanomas. In view of continually new discoveries of stromal changes that can be used for the differential diagnosis of tumors, the importance of close evaluation of stromal elements of tumors, and diligent application of electron microscopy in tumor diagnosis cannot be overemphasized.","title":"Stromal elements for tumor diagnosis: a brief review of diagnostic electron microscopic features.","pubmedId":"16036885"}
