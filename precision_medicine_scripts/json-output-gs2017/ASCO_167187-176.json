The 19-gene RespondR score significantly stratifies TNBC patients by likelihood of response to AT therapy. To identify potentially effective therapeutics for AT-insensitive TNBC patients; i.e., those with low RespondR score, we explore genomic and genetic data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and response in a cisplatin-treated dataset. Methods: The RespondR score was calculated for TNBC patients in TCGA treated with a taxane (n \u003d 84), and TNBC patients in GSE18864 treated with neoadjuvant cisplatin (n \u003d 24). Results: Taxane-treated TNBC patients in TCGA with high RespondR score (RR-high, 46%) have significantly better 5-year relapse-free survival (0.92, 95%CI 0.82-1.0) than patients with low RespondR (RR-low) score (0.68, 95%CI 0.52-0.89). In these RR-low TCGA samples, relapse is significantly (p \u003d 0.03) associated with loss of the gene PTEN (36% of the RR-low patients with PTEN loss relapse, while 12% of the samples without PTEN loss relapse). In RR-high, relapse is not associated with loss of PTEN (None of the RR-high group with PTEN loss relapse, while 10% of those without PTEN loss relapse). In addition, 31% of the RR-low relapse cases have loss of genes involved in DNA repair, e.g., XRCC4 and BRCA2, indicating possible sensitivity to platinum-based therapy. In the dataset GSE18864, 50% of the patients with low RespondR score achieve partial or complete pathological response to cisplatin treatment. Conclusions: The addition of other agents to AT treatment for patients with high RespondR score is unlikely to significantly improve survival over AT alone. Loss of PTEN is associated with higher incidence of recurrence specifically in patients with low RespondR scores. Patients with low RespondR score and PTEN loss could be ideal candidates for PARP1 or PI3K-AKT signaling inhibitors. DNA damaging agents may also significantly improve survival for low RespondR patients. RespondR provides vital information to TNBC patients and their physicians in the search for the most effective choice of chemotherapy.","title":"RespondR signature to predict potential alternative therapies for taxane resistant triple-negative breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_167187-176"}
