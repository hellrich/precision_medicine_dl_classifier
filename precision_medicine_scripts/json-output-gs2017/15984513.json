Recently, several randomized trials with a large number of enrolled patients have shown that platinum-based chemotherapy has potential for improving survival among patients with completely resected NSCLC in Western countries. In Japan, uracil-tegafur was also shown to improve survival among patients with completely resected stage I adenocarcinoma. This review evaluated the role of adjuvant chemotherapy, based on the results of randomized trials and meta-analyses.","title":"[Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"15984513"}
