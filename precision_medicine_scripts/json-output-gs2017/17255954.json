Using sequence analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, we found a novel mutation (Asp108 Tyr), segregating with the disease in three families. This mutation has previously been detected as a somatic mutation in other cancers. We found a previously described Swedish founder mutation (ins113Arg) in one family and a large duplication encompassing the CDKN2A gene locus in another family. Moreover, a debated polymorphism (Ala148Thr) was found in nine families, in which the polymorphism did not segregate with the disease.","title":"Novel CDKN2A mutations detected in western Swedish families with hereditary malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"17255954"}
