This report examines the death pathways of human cells with various BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotypes after exposure to gamma-rays. A lack of functional BRCA1 and BRCA2 led to defective repair of DNA double-strand breaks in irradiated cells. This impairment resulted in a relaxation of cell cycle checkpoints, production of micronuclei, and a loss of proliferative capacity. Heterozygous BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations also led to enhanced radiosensitivity, with an impaired proliferative capacity after irradiation. The existence of a phenotype related to radiosensitivity in BRCA1+/- and BRCA2+/- cells raises the question of the response of heterozygous women to radiation.","title":"Gamma-rays-induced death of human cells carrying mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2.","pubmedId":"10602489"}
