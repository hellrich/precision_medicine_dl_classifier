The relationship between the genetic polymorphisms and development to HCC were evaluated in well-matched patients with HCC (HCC group, n \u003d 67) and without HCC (non-HCC group, n \u003d 67) using propensity scores in age, sex, and prevalence of diabetes mellitus.\nDaily amount of ethanol consumption was significantly lower (P \u003d 0.005), and consumptive period was significantly longer (P \u003d 0.003) in HCC group than non-HCC group. Of 134 well-matched patients, 113 (84.3%) had ALDH2*1/*1 genotype and 21 (15.7%) had ALDH2*1/*2 genotype. In HCC development, consumptive long period (P \u003d 0.007) and carrying ALDH2*1/*2 genotype (P \u003d 0.026) were identified as significant factors independently participated, while there was no relation to ADH1B polymorphism. In addition, consumptive period was significantly longer in HCC group than non-HCC group in ALDH2*1/*1 genotype patients (P \u003d 0.0005), while there was no difference in profile of ethanol consumption in ALDH2*1/*2 genotype patients. Among HCC group, daily (P \u003d 3.78 × 10(-6) ) and cumulative amount (P \u003d 4.89 × 10(-6) ) of ethanol consumption were significantly higher in ALDH2*1/*1 genotype patients than ALDH2*1/*2 genotype patients.\nIn alcoholic liver cirrhosis, investigations of ALDH2 polymorphism and ethanol consumption profile are useful for prediction of HCC development.","title":"Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 polymorphism for development to hepatocellular carcinoma in East Asian alcoholic liver cirrhosis.","pubmedId":"25778454"}
