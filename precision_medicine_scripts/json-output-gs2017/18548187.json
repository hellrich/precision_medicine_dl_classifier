Under 50 years of age these tumors are more commonly genetical and have worse prognosis. A 25-year-old woman presented with back pain and progressive walking difficulty. An intradural extramedullary tumor extending from thoracal 9th to lumbar 2nd vertebral body was detected. The patient was operated and the tumor was totally removed. The histopathological diagnosis was angiomatous meningioma. Neurological symptoms and signs partially improved postoperatively. Interestingly, magnetic resonance imaging of this patient might easily be confused with ependymoma. Although we performed laminectomy and instrumentation, to maintain stability laminoplasty should be the first treatment modality for such a young patient.","title":"A multilevel thoracolumbar meningioma in a young woman.","pubmedId":"18548187"}
