Most cases of oncogenic osteomalacia have been associated with benign tumors of bone or soft tissue; however, whether malignant neoplasms can also produce and secrete FGF23 is currently unknown.\nThe aim was to determine whether a malignant neoplasm could cause oncogenic osteomalacia through excessive production and secretion of FGF23.\nWe describe an 80-year-old woman with stage IV colon adenocarcinoma who presented with severe hypophosphatemia (0.4 mg/dL; reference, 2.6-4.5 mg/dL).\nFractional excretion of phosphate was 34% (reference, \u003c5% in the setting of hypophosphatemia), and plasma levels of FGF23 were highly elevated at 674 RU/mL (reference, \u003c180 RU/mL). Immunohistochemical analysis of the patient\u0027s tumor showed strong staining for FGF23. Genetic analyses revealed a point mutation in the KRAS gene.\nWe present the first case in which a malignant neoplasm is documented to produce and secrete FGF23, leading to renal phosphate-wasting. Oncogenic osteomalacia should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with a malignant tumor who present with hypophosphatemia.","title":"Oncogenic osteomalacia due to FGF23-expressing colon adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23393166"}
