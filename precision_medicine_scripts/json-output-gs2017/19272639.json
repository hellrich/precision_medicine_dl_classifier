ERBB2 amplification was examined using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes for ERBB2 and the centromere of chromosome 17 (CEP17).\nERBB2 amplification, defined as \u003e2 copies of ERBB2/CEP17, was a rare event in EOC with 7% (9/133) of women exhibiting between 2.2 and 33.7 copies of ERBB2/CEP17, and was not associated with patient age, race, GOG performance status, stage, cell type, grade, measurable disease status, volume of ascites, tumor response or disease status post-chemotherapy. Women with \u003e2 verses \u003c or \u003d2 copies of ERBB2/CEP17 did not have a reduced risk of disease progression (hazard ratio [HR]\u003d0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u003d0.27-1.16; p\u003d0.120) or death (HR\u003d0.57; 95% CI\u003d0.26-1.23; p\u003d0.152), and ERBB2 amplification was not an independent prognostic factor for PFS or OS. ERBB2 amplification, defined as \u003e4 copies of ERBB2/nuclei, was observed in 9% (12/133) of women with levels ranging from 4.2 to 49.2 copies of ERBB2/nuclei, and was associated with older age and volume of ascites, but not with the other clinical covariates or outcome.\nERBB2 amplification is a rare event and has no predictive or prognostic value in suboptimally-resected, advanced stage EOC treated with platinum-based combination chemotherapy.","title":"Associations between ERBB2 amplification and progression-free survival and overall survival in advanced stage, suboptimally-resected epithelial ovarian cancers: a Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.","pubmedId":"19272639"}
