Patients with these phenomena had a poor survival prognosis, 7 months VS 18 months. However amplification of EGFR and deletion of PTEN were relatively low in other malignancy brain tumors. They were 36% and 8% in medulloblastomas, and 28% and 8% in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, and 24% and 4% in anaplastic ependymomas.\nPTEN mutation and EGFR amplification are important prognostic factors in patients with glioblastoma multiformes. PTEN mutation and EGFR overexpression are rare in medulloblastoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and anaplastic ependymoma, so the EGFR or PTEN targeted antitumor approaches may be useful in glioblastoma multiformes but the other 3 tumors.","title":"[Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and PTEN in malignancy brain tumors].","pubmedId":"17236582"}
