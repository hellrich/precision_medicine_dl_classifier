It has been clearly demonstrated that mutations in the genetic information is the initiating event of cancer. DNA damage such as DNA double-strand breaks leads to genomic instability and cancer development. Cells can repair DNA double-strand breaks through several mechanisms. Nevertheless, only homologous recombination repair is faithful and repairs DNA without creating mutations. Here, we review the roles of PALB2 and BRCA2 in homologous recombination and genome stability.","title":"[Functions of PALB2 and BRCA2 tumor suppressors in DNA double-strand break repair].","pubmedId":"23544385"}
