It was so complicate for each patient underwent the BGS detection with clones. It is important to explore a simple, rapid and accurate method to detect methylated CpG site count to predicting the prognosis for gastric cancer patients.\nAt present study, we detected hypermethylated and hypomethylated CpG site count of RNF180 DNA promoter in samples of 480 gastric cancer patients by direct bisulfite sequencing.\nWe found that patients who possessed seven or less hypermethylated CpG sites of RNF180 DNA promoter had much better survival (p\u003d 0.008), which was similar to our previous research results by using the BGS with clones. With the multivariate survival analysis, we found that T stage, N stage and hypermethylated CpG site count of RNF180 DNA promoter were the independent predictors of prognosis for gastric cancer patients.\nhypermethylated CpG site count of RNF180 DNA promoter for evaluating the prognosis of gastric cancer was reasonable by using the direct bisulfite sequencing.","title":"Evaluating the clinical feasibility: The direct bisulfite genomic sequencing for examination of methylated status of E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF180 DNA promoter to predict the survival of gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"25769451"}
