However, toxicities of NSAIDs have limited their use as antineoplastic therapy. Recent data have suggested that the benefit of aspirin after CRC diagnosis is limited to patients with PIK3CA-mutant cancers. We sought to determine the predictive utility of PIK3CA mutation for benefit from both cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition and aspirin.\nWe performed molecular analysis of tumors from 896 participants in the Vioxx in Colorectal Cancer Therapy: Definition of Optimal Regime (VICTOR) trial, a large randomized trial comparing rofecoxib with placebo after primary CRC resection. We compared relapse-free survival and overall survival between rofecoxib therapy and placebo and between the use and nonuse of low-dose aspirin, according to tumor PIK3CA mutation status.\nWe found no evidence of a greater benefit from rofecoxib treatment compared with placebo in patients whose tumors had PIK3CA mutations (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; 95% CI, 0.53 to 2.72; P \u003d .66; (P)INTERACTION \u003d .47) compared with patients with PIK3CA wild-type cancers (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.16; P \u003d .34). In contrast, regular aspirin use after CRC diagnosis was associated with a reduced rate of CRC recurrence in patients with PIK3CA-mutant cancers (HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.001 to 0.832; P \u003d .027; (P)INTERACTION \u003d .024) but not in patients lacking tumor PIK3CA mutation (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.42; P \u003d .71).\nAlthough tumor PIK3CA mutation does not predict benefit from rofecoxib treatment, it merits further evaluation as a predictive biomarker for aspirin therapy. Our findings are concordant with recent data and support the prospective investigation of adjuvant aspirin in PIK3CA-mutant CRC.","title":"Evaluation of PIK3CA mutation as a predictor of benefit from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"24062397"}
