The tumour was a suprasellar meningioma in one case and an optic chiasm/hypothalamic astrocytoma in the other. In both cases, the aneurysm was successfully embolized using Guglielmi detachable coils. Subsequently craniotomy was performed with complete excision of the meningioma and subtotal removal of the astrocytoma. Endovascular techniques can be employed to make the surgical excision of an intracranial tumour co-existing with an incidental aneurysm safer.","title":"Cerebral aneurysm associated with an intracranial tumour: staged endovascular and surgical treatment in two cases.","pubmedId":"15327233"}
