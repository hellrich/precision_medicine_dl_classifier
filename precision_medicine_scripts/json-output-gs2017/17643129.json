Tamoxifen benefits all stages of the disease, but its use increases the risk of uterine cancer and thromboembolic events and it can only be administered for 5 years. Aromatase inhibitors are superior to tamoxifen at advanced stages of disease and as adjuvants; however, because they increase fractures, aromatase inhibitors are unlikely to be used to prevent disease. Raloxifene, a second-generation SERM, leads, like tamoxifen, to approximately 50% fewer cases of invasive breast cancer in high risk women, with a lower incidence of thromboembolic events. Several other SERMs are in development to improve tissue specificity, efficacy and tolerance. Raloxifene shows protection against vertebral fractures similar to bisphosphonates; however, no significant effect has been observed on nonvertebral fractures. Many SERMs are in development for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. As breast cancer metastasizes early and advanced disease cannot be cured, prevention is essential. To avoid the concerns about the use of traditional hormone replacement therapy, dehydroepiandrosterone--a tissue-targeted precursor of sex steroid formation--offers hope of a physiological tissue-targeted hormone replacement that, combined with a SERM, would simultaneously prevent breast and uterine cancer.","title":"Drug insight: breast cancer prevention and tissue-targeted hormone replacement therapy.","pubmedId":"17643129"}
