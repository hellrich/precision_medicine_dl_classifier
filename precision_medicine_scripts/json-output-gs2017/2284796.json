The treatment with steroidogenesis blockers (Metyrapone, o,p\u0027DDD) led to a limited improvement. The well expressed organic changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and pulmonary thromboembolism led to a fatal outcome. The post mortem examination revealed a pancreatic tumor 30/30 mm in size (histologically carcinoid) and enlarged hypophyseal gland with oxyphil cell hyperplasia. The electron microscopic examination found secretory granules in the pancreatic tumor cells. Concurrent ectopic secretion of ACTH by the oxyphil tumor cells is discussed.","title":"[Cushing\u0027s syndrome resulting from ectopic hormonal secretion].","pubmedId":"2284796"}
