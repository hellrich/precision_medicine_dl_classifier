The clinical data were retrospectively reviewed and the pathological examination was reviewed. Follow-up was performed.\nThere were 176 males and 101 females. The age ranged from 20 to 81 years old (median,57). Location of the tumor included colorectum (n\u003d28),small bowel(n\u003d76), stomach(n\u003d173). All the patients had en bloc resection, including local excision in 98 patients, organ resection in 64, and extended resection in 115. The 5-year survival rates were 83.5%, 71.9%, and 61.9% in the three different procedures, respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant(P\u003e0.05). Cox model showed that the tumor size, recurrence and metastasis were independent risk factors associated with the prognosis in GIST patients(P\u003c0.05).\nSurgery remains the major approach for gastrointestinal GIST. Complete resection is the principal treatment. Extensive resection or extended lymph nodes dissection is not associated with improved survival.","title":"[Surgical treatment and prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor].","pubmedId":"22030776"}
