In the present study we investigated whether this method is useful for the diagnosis of lung cancer in small pulmonary lesions, which are difficult to diagnose cytologically as lung cancer by bronchoscopic examination. We examined bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from 33 patients with single nodular pulmonary lesions of less than 2 cm in diameter (measured on chest computed tomography scans) for K-ras (codon 12) mutation, by PCR-PIREMA. Transbronchial fiberscopic examinations had not revealed lung cancer cytologically in any of the patients. The final diagnoses for the 33 lesions were 20 adenocarcinomas, 5 cases of focal fibrosis, 5 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of tuberculosis, 1 hamartoma, and 1 case of lymph node swelling. BALF cell lysates were amplified and digested with a restriction enzyme to detect the K-ras oncogene. Only the normal K-ras was observed after the first amplification and digestion for each of the 33 patients. Three amplifications and digestions were performed for each sample. We detected mutation of K-ras in BALF cells from 15 (75%) of 20 lung cancer patients and in cells from only 4 (31%) of 13 patients with nonmalignant lesions. The detection rate of the K-ras mutation in lung cancer was significantly greater than that in nonmalignant lesions (P \u003d 0.012). Our results indicate that the detection of the codon 12 K-ras mutation in BALF cells by PCR-PIREMA aids the diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with small pulmonary lesions with negative cytological findings.","title":"Detection of K-ras mutations of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells aids the diagnosis of lung cancer in small pulmonary lesions.","pubmedId":"10100714"}
