We screened the 10q locus for loss of heterozygosity and the promoter methylation status of PTEN, MGMT, MXI1, and FGFR2 in neuroblastic tumors and neuroblastoma cell lines. Expression of these genes in cell lines was analyzed with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Loss of heterozygosity at 10q was detected in 18% of tumors and microsatellite instability in 14%. Promoter hypermethylation of MGMT appeared in 8% of tumors and 25% of cell lines. Correlation between methylation status and lack of expression was evident for PTEN, FGFR2, and MXI1 and was less clear for MGMT. No associations between these alterations and MYCN amplification, 1p deletion, or aggressive tumor histology could be demonstrated, singly or in combination. These data suggest that 10q alterations might be implicated in the development of a small number of neuroblastomas.","title":"Loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability on chromosome arm 10q in neuroblastoma.","pubmedId":"17350460"}
