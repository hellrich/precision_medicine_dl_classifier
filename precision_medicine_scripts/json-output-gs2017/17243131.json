FGFR2 also has been shown to be amplified in stomach and breast cancers. We report the case of a 13-year-old female with Apert syndrome who developed an ovarian dysgerminoma. The FGFR2 exon 7 sequencing showed the classical Apert syndrome c.758C \u003e G transversion (p.Pro253Arg). The genomic analyses of the tumor cells showed low level gains and losses of several chromosomes. This is the second report of the association of Apert syndrome with cancer. Our observation raises the hypothesis of a role for FGFR2 mutations in tumorigenesis.","title":"Ovarian dysgerminoma and Apert syndrome.","pubmedId":"17243131"}
