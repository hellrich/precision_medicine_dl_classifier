KRAS MASI was defined as predominance of the mutant allele over the wild-type allele. We assessed the frequency of KRAS MASI by comparing peak heights of mutant and wild-type alleles on sequencing electropherograms and by KRAS fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A review of sequencing electropherograms of 207 KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinomas demonstrated 23 (11%) cases with the mutant allele peak higher than the wild-type allele peak and 15 (7%) cases with the mutant allele peak equal to the wild-type allele peak. Of 17 cases with the mutant allele peak higher or equal to the wild-type allele peak, 8 (47%) showed KRAS amplification by FISH. KRAS FISH analysis of 36 KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinomas with the mutant allele peak lower than the wild-type allele peak, 21 KRAS and EGFR wild-type and 16 EGFR-mutated adenocarcinomas showed no KRAS amplification. KRAS MASI was associated with selective amplification of the KRAS mutant allele (P\u003c0.001). Patients with KRAS MASI showed worse overall survival. The cumulative proportion surviving at 17 months for KRAS MASI group was 35% compared with 84.1% for patients with KRAS mutant allele peak lower than wild-type allele peak (P\u003d0.012). The adverse prognostic significance of KRAS MASI was independent of clinical stage and was maintained among stage I patients. The detection of KRAS MASI in lung adenocarcinomas by sequencing electropherograms may identify patients with more aggressive disease.","title":"KRAS mutant allele-specific imbalance in lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"21743433"}
