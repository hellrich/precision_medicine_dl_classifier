Atypical imaging findings that should suggest diagnoses other than adenocarcinoma include the absence of significant duct dilatation, incidental detection, hypervascularity, large size (\u003e 5 cm), IV tumor thrombus, and intralesional ducts or cysts.","title":"Pancreatic imaging mimics: part 1, imaging mimics of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22826390"}
