The authors briefly review the topic of oncogenes and the relevance of oncogenes to breast carcinoma; also included is a description of current techniques commonly employed in the study of aberrant oncogene structure and function. Also presented is the authors\u0027 own work on oncogene expression in breast neoplasms, which implicates the neu, fms, PDGF-A and Ki-ras oncogenes in the control of mammary epithelial cell proliferation by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.","title":"Oncogene structure, function, and expression in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"2669069"}
