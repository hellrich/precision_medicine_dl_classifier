Immunohistochemistry using a mouse monoclonal antibody has a high specificity and sensitivity for detecting IDH1 R132H mutant protein in sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Angiocentric glioma (AG), a unique neoplasm with mixed phenotypic features of diffuse glioma and ependymoma, has recently been codified as a grade I neoplasm in the 2007 World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors. The present study was designed to evaluate IDH1 R132H protein in AG. Three cases of AG were collected, and the diagnoses were confirmed. Expression of mutant IDH1 R132H protein was determined by immunohistochemistry on representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections using the antihuman mouse monoclonal antibody IDH1 R132H (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Known IDH1 mutation-positive and IDH1 wild-type cases of grade II to IV glioma served as positive and negative controls. All 3 patients were male, aged 3, 5, and 15 years, with intra-axial tumors in the right posterior parietal-occipital lobe, right frontal lobe, and left frontal lobe, respectively. All 3 cases showed characteristic morphologic features of AG, including a monomorphous population of slender bipolar cells that diffusely infiltrated cortical parenchyma and ensheathed cortical blood vessels radially and longitudinally. All 3 cases were negative for the presence of IDH1 R132H mutant protein (0/3). All control cases showed appropriate reactivity. IDH1 R132H mutation has been described as a common molecular signature of grade II and III diffuse gliomas and secondary glioblastoma; however, AG, which exhibits some features of diffuse glioma, has not been evaluated. The absence of mutant IDH1 R132H protein expression in AG may help further distinguish this unique neoplasm from diffuse glioma.","title":"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 R132H mutation is not detected in angiocentric glioma.","pubmedId":"22445362"}
