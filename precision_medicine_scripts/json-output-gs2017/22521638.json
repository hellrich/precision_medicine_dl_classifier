First, it is a highly lethal disease, with a median survival of less than 6 months and a 5-year survival rate less than 5%. Second, PDA tumor cells are surrounded by an extensive stroma, which accounts for up to 90% of the tumor volume. It is well recognized that stromal microenvironment can accelerate malignant transformation, tumor growth and progression. More importantly, the interaction loop between PDA and its stroma greatly contributes to tumor growth and progression. We propose that the extensive stroma of PDA is closely linked to its poor prognosis. An improved understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to pancreatic tumor growth and progression is therefore urgently needed. Targeting the stroma may thus provide novel prevention, earlier detection and therapeutic options to this deadly malignancy. Accordingly, in this review, we will summarize the mechanism of PDA stroma formation, the role of the stroma in tumor progression and therapy resistance and the potential of stroma-targeted therapeutics strategies.","title":"Stroma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: an interaction loop.","pubmedId":"22521638"}
