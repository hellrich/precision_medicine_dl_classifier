Expression of cdx2 mRNA, CDX2 protein, muc2 mRNA, MUC2 apomucin, and MUC5AC apomucin were determined.\nOf 23 IPMN, expression of cdx2 was detected in 8 of 9 adenomas, 6 of 8 borderline malignancies, and 3 of 6 malignancies, respectively. Of the 3 cdx2-expressing malignant IPMN, 2 did not display CDX2 expression. The appearance of CDX2-positive neoplastic cells in IPMN coincided with that of MUC2-positive neoplastic cells. All 23 IPMN displayed a positive MUC5AC expression irrespective to the status of CDX2 expression. Of 30 ductal adenocarcinomas, none displayed cdx2, CDX2, and MUC2 expression, while 10 cases displayed positive MUC5AC expression.\nAberrant expression of cdx2 homeobox gene was detected in IPMN but not in ductal adenocarcinoma, which might determine their diverse carcinogenesis.","title":"Aberrant expression of cdx2 homeobox gene in intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas but not in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"15782100"}
