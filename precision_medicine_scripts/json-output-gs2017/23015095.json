We investigated the prognostic value of IDH mutations and methylation of the promoter region of the MGMT gene in 99 patients with sHGG and analyzed the clinical course of those tumors. Patients with sHGG were screened for IDH mutations by direct sequencing, and, for promoter status of MGMT gene, by the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. A total of 48 of 99 patients (48.5 %) had secondary anaplastic gliomas (Group 1), while 51 patients had secondary glioblastomas (Group 2). The median survival time after malignant progression of all patients with sHGG and with an IDH mutation was 4 years, which is significantly longer than in patients with wild-type IDH (1.2 years, p \u003d 0.009). Patients\u0027 survival was not significantly influenced by the tumors\u0027 MGMT promoter status, both in Group 1- 9.7 years vs. 6.1 years, methylated vs. unmethylated promoter (p \u003d 0.330)-as well as in Group 2-1.5 years vs. 1.6 years, methylated versus unmethylated promoter (p \u003d 0.829). In our population, the IDH mutation status was not associated with increased PFS or median survival time in sGBM patients. However, patients with secondary anaplastic glioma and IDH mutation had a significantly improved outcome. In addition, IDH mutations are a more powerful prognostic marker concerning both PFS and MS than the MGMT promoter status in those patients.","title":"The prognostic value of IDH mutations and MGMT promoter status in secondary high-grade gliomas.","pubmedId":"23015095"}
