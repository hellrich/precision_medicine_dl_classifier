Although the role of the MYC gene as the driver of the 8q24 amplicon is well established, the significance of the 8q21 amplicon is less clear. The breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 contains three separate 8q21 amplicons, the distal two of which correspond to putative target genes TPD52 and WWP1. To understand the effect of proximal 8q21 amplification on breast cancer phenotype and patient prognosis, we analyzed 8q21 copy number changes using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a tissue microarray containing more than 2000 breast cancers. Amplification at 8q21 was found in 3% of tumors, and was associated with medullary type (P\u003c0.03), high tumor grade (P\u003c0.0001), high Ki67 labeling index (P\u003c0.05), amplification of MYC (P\u003c0.0001), HER2, MDM2, and CCND1 (P\u003c0.05 each), as well as the total number of gene amplifications (P\u003c0.0001). 8q21 copy number gains were significantly related to unfavorable patient outcome in univariate analysis. However, multivariate Cox regression analysis did not reveal an independent prognostic value of 8q21 amplification. The position of our FISH probe and data of a previously performed high-resolution CGH study in the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 involve TCEB1 and TMEM70 as new possible candidate oncogenes at 8q21 in breast cancer.","title":"Amplification of 8q21 in breast cancer is independent of MYC and associated with poor patient outcome.","pubmedId":"20139910"}
