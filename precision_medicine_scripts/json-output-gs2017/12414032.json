Of these 564 patients, 101 patients were found to have pathologic N2 disease. Systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed in all these patients. Recurrence was determined and nineteen clinicopathologic prognostic factors were evaluated in relation to recurrence-free survival.\nComplete resection rate was 83.2% and overall 5-year survival was 23.3%. Locoregional and distant metastasis were detected in 50 of 101 patients (49.5%) during follow-up. Five-year recurrence-free survival was 19.6%. Among 19 clinicopathologic prognostic factors, incomplete resection and non-downstaging after neoadjuvant therapy were unfavorable prognostic factors in univariate analyses. Clinical N2 status, multiple N2 nodes, and cell type of adenocarcinoma showed poor prognosis but were not statistically significant. Postoperative chemotherapy showed good prognosis but was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis showed that significant favorable prognostic factors were complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.\nComplete resection and responsiveness to neoadjuvant therapy were the most important favorable prognostic factors in recurrence-free survival. Postoperative chemotherapy was also a favorable prognostic factor but not statistically significant in recurrence-free survival in pN2 non-small cell lung cancer.","title":"Recurrence-free survival and prognostic factors in resected pN2 non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"12414032"}
