She presented to us with only a light fever and early stage ampullary carcinoma was subsequently diagnosed by endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including an endoscopic retrograde choledochopancreatography. The patient is presently alive and well without any evidence of recurrence 33 months after undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy.","title":"Ampullary carcinoma associated with familial polyposis coli--a case report.","pubmedId":"1964703"}
