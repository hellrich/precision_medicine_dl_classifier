Loss of Klotho protein expression, klotho promoter hypermethylation, high miR-504 levels, and high phospho-IGF-1R levels significantly correlated with poor survival, high clinical and pathological stages in PDAC patients. The demethylation reagent and miR-504 inhibitor increased klotho gene expression, invasion, and migration in BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells. Klotho is a tumor suppressor whose expression in PDAC correlated with progression and prognosis of PDAC.","title":"Identification of novel predictive markers for the prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24745611"}
