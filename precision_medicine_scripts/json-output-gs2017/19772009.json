It can be associated with cystic pulmonary lesions, which may be evident at the time of diagnosis or predate the appearance of the tumour. There are contradictory reports about the value of prophylactic resection of pulmonary cysts in protecting patients from developing PPB. We report an individual case where asymptomatic congenital lobar emphysema was incidentally picked up on CXR. Following a period of surveillance the lesion was resected due to increasing size. The histology of the lesion revealed PPB Type I.","title":"Pleuropulmonary blastoma type I following resection of incidentally found congenital lobar emphysema.","pubmedId":"19772009"}
