The IDH1 mutation induces down-regulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and up-regulation of lipid metabolism. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) regulate not only the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids but also acyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 that halts the cell cycle at G1. Here we show that SREBPs were up-regulated in U87 human glioblastoma cells transfected with an IDH1(R132H)-expression plasmid. Small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) for SREBP1 specifically decreased p21 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels independent of the p53 pathway. In IDH1(R132H)-expressing U87 cells, phosphorylation of Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein also decreased. We propose that metabolic changes induced by the IDH1 mutation enhance p21 expression via SREBP1 and inhibit phosphorylation of Rb, which slows progression of the cell cycle and may be associated with non-aggressive features of gliomas with an IDH1 mutation.
