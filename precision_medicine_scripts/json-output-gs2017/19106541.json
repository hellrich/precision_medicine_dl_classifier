Its chief complaint of the case was epigastralgia in April 2007, and the diagnosis was locally-advanced cancer of pancreatic body (4 cm, Stage IVa) in June 2007. Laparotomy was performed, but the locally-advanced cancer was unresectable because of the invasion to the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery. Tumor biopsy and intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT, 12 MeV, 20 Gy) were only performed. The result of biopsy was moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma. After laparoptomy, systemic chemotherapy (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/body) was performed once a week. After 4-set chemotherapy, her cancer pain was completely relieved and the tumor size was decreased to 25 mm on CT scan in October 2007. She has been treated as an outpatient.","title":"[A case report of intra-operative radiotherapy and gemcitabine for unresectable pancreatic body cancer].","pubmedId":"19106541"}
