The lack of treatments with durable responses for stage IV melanoma may be due, at least in part, to an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate tumor initiation and/or progression to metastasis. Recent evidence supports miRNA dysregulation in melanoma impacting several well-known pathways such as the PI3K/AKT or RAS/MAPK pathways, but also underexplored cellular processes like protein glycosylation and immune modulation. There is also increasing evidence that miRNA can improve patient prognostic classification over the classical staging system and provide new therapeutic opportunities. The integration of this recently acquired knowledge with known molecular alterations in protein coding genes characteristic of these tumors (i.e., BRAF and NRAS mutations, CDKN2A inactivation) is critical for a complete understanding of melanoma pathogenesis. Here, we compile the evidence of the functional roles of miRNAs in melanomagenesis and progression, and of their clinical utility as biomarkers, prognostic tools and potential therapeutic targets. Characterization of miRNA alterations in melanoma may provide new angles for therapeutic intervention, help to decipher mechanisms of drug resistance, and improve patient classification for disease surveillance and clinical benefit.","title":"MicroRNA and cutaneous melanoma: from discovery to prognosis and therapy.","pubmedId":"22693259"}
