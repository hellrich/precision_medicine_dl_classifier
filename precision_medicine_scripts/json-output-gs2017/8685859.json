Up to now, there is no possibility to screen patients for pancreatic carcinomas, and the symptoms of the disease are uncharacteristic and often misleading. Surgical treatment, with resection of the tumor is the only chance for cure, but for experienced pancreatic surgeons, an advanced tumor stage at the time of operation is a common finding. Large studies reveal the poor prognosis of the disease. Only 20-30% of all patients suffering from pancreatic cancer can be operated with curative intention. In 80-85% of all cases, the tumor has spread into peripancreatic lymph nodes. Thus, mean 5-years survival rates of 3 to 5% are commonly reported, and the median survival time after establishment of diagnosis is 4-6 months. Improvements in surgical technique and postoperative patient\u0027s care have led to an impressive decrease in the formerly considerable morbidity and mortality after pancreatic resection. If the tumor can be resected at an early stage and the regional lymph nodes are not involved, median 5-years survival rates of 20-40% are commonly reported. Further approaches include more radical surgical procedures with dissection of the entire peripancreatic region and resection of the upper abdominal blood vessels. Whether this new technique or a combination of operation, radiation and chemotherapy will improve the prognosis of the disease remains unclear. Large clinical trials are necessary to prove these assumptions.","title":"[Prognosis in pancreatic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"8685859"}
