Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed retroperitoneal liposarcoma in the right retroperitoneal space. He underwent surgical excision of the tumor with Gerota fascia and perinephrium. The resected tissue was a pale yellow solid and white mucous mass, weighing 1,100 g. Histopathological examination of excised tumors revealed mixed-type liposarcoma (well-differentiated and myxoid types). He received no adjuvant therapy.","title":"[Retroperitoneal mixed-type liposarcoma detected by health examination].","pubmedId":"19827617"}
