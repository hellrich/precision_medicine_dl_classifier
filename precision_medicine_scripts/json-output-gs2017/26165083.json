The frequency of gastric cancer without history of H. pylori infection was less than 1% in Japan. Although preventive effect for gastric cancer of H. pylori eradication can be expected, risk of gastric cancer incidence continues after eradication of H. pylori. The frequency of gastric cancer after successful eradication has been increasing, since eradication treatment was widely spread in Japan. The features of H. pylori-negative gastric cancer were reported to be different from conventional H. pylori-positive gastric cancer. Endoscopic screening of gastric cancer requires to understand the characteristics of gastric cancer based on status of H. pylori infection.","title":"[H. pylori-negative gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"26165083"}
