Bioinformatic analysis was carried out to identify a possible pathway regulating Lgr5 expression in PDAC.\nLgr5 expression was not associated with the expression of tested cancer stem cell markers. Moreover, it was not an independent predictor of survival neither at univariate analysis (p \u003d 0.21) nor at multivariate analysis (p \u003d 0.225).\nBased on the lack of correlation between Lgr5 and tested cancer stem cell markers, Lgr5 does not seem to be a potential stemness marker or prognostic factor in PDAC.","title":"Lgr5 expression, cancer stem cells and pancreatic cancer: results from biological and computational analyses.","pubmedId":"25804119"}
