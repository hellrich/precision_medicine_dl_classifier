Patients harboring ALK rearrangements show very favourable outcomes if treated with targeted agents, among which crizotinib is the first and best studied. Crizotinib, an oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of ALK, MET, and ROS1 kinases, is a very active and well tolerated drug. Nevertheless, the optimal therapy management with this new drug is still partially unknown, especially with regard to the safety of combined treatments. Recently, the integration of locoregional treatments has been proposed as a feasible multimodality strategy in selected patients with good clinical conditions and slow-growing or oligoprogressive disease. In this report, a case of advanced lung adenocarcinoma, progressed after first line chemotherapy and re-biopsied detecting ALK rearrangement, is described. During crizotinib treatment the primary lung tumor showed an excellent regression; meanwhile a major surgery for a metachronous uterine cancer was safely and successfully carried out.
