The products of the locus--p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and ARF--play widespread and independent roles in tumor suppression. Recent data also suggest that expression of p16(INK4a) induces an age-dependent decrease in the proliferative capacity of certain tissue-specific stem cells and unipotent progenitors. Here, we discuss the regulation and role of p16(INK4a), ARF, and p15(INK4b) in cancer and aging.","title":"The regulation of INK4/ARF in cancer and aging.","pubmedId":"17055429"}
