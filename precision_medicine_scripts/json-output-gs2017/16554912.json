In this study, a total of 100 CRCs were evaluated histopathologically, and IMD, bFGF and nm23-H1 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry. IMD of patients increased with grade and stage, and this increase was statistically significant (p\u003c0.05). A significantly higher incidence of high bFGF expression scores was also associated with increasing grade and stage (p\u003c0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the grades in nm23-H1 expression (p\u003d0.234). nm23-H1 expression occurred with lower incidence in stages C1, C2 and D than in stages B1 and B2 (p\u003c0.05). Thus, a negative correlation was found between nm23-H1 expression and stage or lymph node metastasis (LNM) (p\u003c0.05). IMD and bFGF expression were positively correlated with grade, stage, LNM, and lymphovascular invasion. Although positive correlation was found between IMD and bFGF, nm23-H1 expression negatively correlated with both of them. As a result, in clinical practice, increased IMD and bFGF expression and decreased nm23-H1 expression may provide valuable information in characterizing the malignant phenotype.","title":"The intratumoral microvessel density and expression of bFGF and nm23-H1 in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"16554912"}
