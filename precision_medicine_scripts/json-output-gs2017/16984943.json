Smokers with scleroderma and cancer smoke more than smokers with scleroderma without cancer (p\u003d0.019). Pulmonary fibrosis and anti-topoisomerase antibody do not increase the risk of lung cancer. Peripheral lung tumours occur earlier after the onset of scleroderma symptoms than bronchogenic tumours (p\u003d0.05).\nSmokers with scleroderma should be monitored for the presence of lung cancer and counselled to quit smoking. The earlier development of peripheral lung tumours is not consistent, with pulmonary fibrosis being an aetiological factor.","title":"Risk factors for lung cancer in patients with scleroderma: a nested case-control study.","pubmedId":"16984943"}
