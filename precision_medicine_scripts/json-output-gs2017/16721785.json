RAS mutations are known to occur in prostate adenocarcinomas, but little is known about BRAF mutations in these tumors. In the present study, BRAF and KRAS mutations were characterized in 206 prostate adenocarcinomas by enhanced PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing. The identified KRAS and BRAF mutations were then analyzed with respect to preoperative serum PSA levels, Gleason scores and tumor stages. Mutations in codon 600 of BRAF were identified in 21 (10.2%) of 206 prostate adenocarcinomas. KRAS mutations in codons 12 or 13 were found in 15 (7.3%) of 206 prostate adenocarcinomas. However, no tumor specimen contained both BRAF and KRAS mutations. Prostate adenocarcinomas with a BRAF mutation tended to show higher preoperative serum PSA levels, Gleason scores and tumor stages than prostate adenocarcinomas with a KRAS mutation. The results obtained show that BRAF mutations are as uncommon as KRAS mutations in prostate adenocarcinoma. Although BRAF and KRAS are members of the same RAS/ERK signaling pathway, prostate adenocarcinomas with a BRAF mutation showed clinicopathologic features that differed from those of prostate adenocarcinoma with a KRAS mutation.","title":"BRAF and KRAS mutations in prostatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"16721785"}
