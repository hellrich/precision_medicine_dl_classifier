{"publicationTypes":["2014 AACR Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Objectives: Cervical cancer is not only a leading gynecologic cancer in the developing countries but disproportionately accounts for the burden due to cancer. In spite of the need for holistic care of cervical cancer, little is known about the experience of the affected populations beyond their cancer treatment. This study aims to investigate the pattern and distribution of symptoms burden in subjects with cervical cancer in a developing context.Methods: This cross sectional study was carried out among 122 consenting participants with cervical cancer using a designed questionnaire to elicit socio-demographic with clinical profile and symptoms burden. Subsequently, Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale Revised (CESD-R) was used to ascertain presence of depressive symptoms in participants. Data analyses were done using SPSS-15.Results: Majority of the subjects, 50(41.0%) and 68(55.7%) were in their fifth decade of life and unmarried respectively. Six (4.9%) participants presented with early stage cancer, while close to two-thirds of the participants made up of 76(62.3%) subjects had advanced stage cancer. The largest proportion, consisting of about 7 in every 10 participants had pain, 70(57.4%) participants reported sexual dysfunction, and common sexual problems that were reported include loss of libido, dyspareunia and anorganism among others. In addition, physical complications like ulcer, weight loss and multiple complaints were seen in 56(45.9%) participants. Significant depressive symptoms based on CESD-R cut-off score of 16 and above was elicited among close to half of the participants, 58(47.5%).Conclusions: Late presentation and significant burden of diverse symptoms including pain, sexual, physical and depressive were prevalent among individuals with cervical cancer. Health education with proactive health interventions to promote early presentation and supportive care to ensure qualitative overall care are implied.","title":"Symptoms burden in subjects with cervical cancer and supportive care:A view from a developing country","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3845"}
