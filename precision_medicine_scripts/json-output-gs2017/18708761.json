Clinically, absence of Pim-1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in prostate cancer. In the present study, the expression of Pim-1 is analyzed in pancreatic cancer and correlated to clinicopathological parameters.\nCompared to benign, inflammatory and pre-malignant conditions (i.e., the normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis and benign intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm), expression of Pim-1 mRNA and protein increased significantly in pancreatic malignancies. Absence of Pim-1 immunopositivity in cancer cells strongly correlated with a poor prognosis (median survival 13.8 vs. 23.4 months, p \u003d 0.0016). In vitro, rapidly dividing (high versus low serum concentrations) and hypoxic cells displayed higher Pim-1 mRNA and protein levels.\nPim-1 mRNA and protein was evaluated with quantitative real-time RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry analyses. Ex vivo expression analysis using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed using human pancreatic tissues of the normal pancreas (n \u003d 10), chronic pancreatitis (n \u003d 30), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 59) and other pancreatic tumors (n \u003d 42). In consecutive sections HIF1-alpha was used as a marker of hypoxia. Survival of patients (n \u003d 35) was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test. In vitro analyses were performed using cultured pancreatic cancer cell lines (n \u003d 8) and primary human pancreatic stellate cells.\nHypoxia is a novel inducer of Pim-1 expression. Compared to non-malignant tissues Pim-1 significantly increases in pancreatic cancer. However, the presence of Pim-1 in cancer cells has a positive prognostic impact.","title":"Hypoxia-inducible proto-oncogene Pim-1 is a prognostic marker in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18708761"}
