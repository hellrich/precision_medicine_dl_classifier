We used interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with anonymous cosmid probes and gene-specific P1 clones to determine the minimal common region of increased copy number and to study involvement of known genes at 20q13. Based on high-level copy number increases (3 to 10-fold) found with one or more probes in 5 of 14 (35%) breast cancer cell lines and in 3 of 36 (8%) primary tumors, the critical region was narrowed to approximately 1.5 megabases at 20q13.2 defined by fractional length pter values 0.81-0.84. Previously known genes were excluded as candidates, implying that this chromosomal region harbors a novel oncogene that contributes to the malignant progression of breast cancer.","title":"Increased copy number at 20q13 in breast cancer: defining the critical region and exclusion of candidate genes.","pubmedId":"8044767"}
