Herein, we evaluated CDKN2A promoter methylation and p16 protein expression for the differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from other liver tumors.\nTumor and corresponding non-tumor liver tissue samples were obtained from 85 patients with liver tumors. CDKN2A promoter methylation was studied using MethyLight technique and methylation-specific PCR (MSP). In the MethyLight analysis, samples with \u003e or \u003d 4% of PMR (percentage of methylated reference) were regarded as hypermethylated. p16 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tissue sections (n \u003d 148) obtained from 81 patients using an immunoreactivity score (IRS) ranging from 0 (no expression) to 6 (strong expression).\nHypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter was found in 23 HCCs (69.7%; mean PMR \u003d 42.34 +/- 27.8%), six (20.7%; mean PMR \u003d 31.85 +/- 18%) liver metastases and in the extralesional tissue of only one patient. Using MSP, 32% of the non-tumor (n \u003d 85), 70% of the HCCs, 40% of the CCCs and 24% of the liver metastases were hypermethylated. Correspondingly, nuclear p16 expression was found immunohistochemically in five (10.9%, mean IRS \u003d 0.5) HCCs, 23 (92%; mean IRS \u003d 4.9) metastases and only occasionally in hepatocytes of non-lesional liver tissues (mean IRS \u003d 1.2). The difference of CDKN2A-methylation and p16 protein expression between HCCs and liver metastases was statistically significant (p \u003c 0.01, respectively).\nPromoter methylation of CDKN2A gene and lack of p16 expression characterize patients with HCC.","title":"Promoter methylation of CDKN2A and lack of p16 expression characterize patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20569442"}
