Patients from group A (20 patients) had a laparoscopic lymph node dissection and patients belonging to group B (22 patients) had an extraperitoneal lymphadenectomy. Historical data, clinical and surgical characteristics, perioperative and post-operative complications were analyzed. Follow-up was conducted according to the oncologic requirements.\nNo significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of blood loss, post-operative pain, transfusions, hospital stay and post-operative hematomas. The extraperitoneal group (group B) significantly showed a reduced operating time, a greater number of nodes removed (p\u003c0.05). The only lymphocyst occurred in group B.\nExtraperitoneal pelvic lymphadenectomy can be considered an adequate technique to complement radical vaginal operations for cervical cancer.","title":"Pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical cancer: extraperitoneal versus laparoscopic approach.","pubmedId":"16359771"}
