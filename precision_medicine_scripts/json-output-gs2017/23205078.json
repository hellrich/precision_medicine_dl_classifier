Among the several factors associated with breast cancer development, angiogenesis plays an essential role and has currently emerged as a potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic target. Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) have important activities in tumor angiogenesis and progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of these two receptors, hypothesising significant correlations between receptor expression in tumor angiogenesis and clinicopathological parameters customarily used in breast cancer prognosis and prediction. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples of ductal invasive breast carcinomas were used to analyze the expression of PAR1 and FGFR1, in the tumor cells as well as in the tumor stroma, and further determine intratumoral microvessel density (iMVD) to quantify intratumoral angiogenesis. Correlations between PAR1 and FGFR1 expression in tumor cells and stroma, iMVD and several clinicopathological parameters and molecular markers used in breast cancer diagnosis have been addressed. The correlation between PAR1 and FGFR1 suggests an association of the two receptors with a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype and, consequently, a potential role during tumor progression. The results reported in the present study also emphasize the importance of microenvironmental factors in tumor progression, while precluding the positive association between iMVD and breast cancer aggressiveness.","title":"Characterization of PAR1 and FGFR1 expression in invasive breast carcinomas: Prognostic significance.","pubmedId":"23205078"}
