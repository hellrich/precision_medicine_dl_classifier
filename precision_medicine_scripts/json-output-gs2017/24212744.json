The predominant form was found to be NADP-IDH1 while NADP-IDH2 represented only about 4% of the total leaf enzyme activity. These enzymes share few common epitopes as NADP-IDH2 was poorly recognized by the specific polyclonal antibodies raised against NADP-IDH1, and as a consequence NADP-IDH2 does not result from a post-translational modification of NADP-IDH1. Subcellular fractionation and isolation of chloroplasts through a Percoll gradient, followed by the identification of the associated enzymes, showed that NADP-IDH1 is restricted to the cytosol and NADP-IDH2 to the chloroplasts. Compared with the cytosolic isoenzyme, NADP-IDH2 was more thermolabile and exhibited a lower optimum pH. The data reported in this paper constitute the first report that the chloroplastic NADP-IDH and the cytosolic NADP-IDH are two distinct isoenzymes. The possible functions of the two isoenzymes are discussed. ","title":"Chromatographic and immunological evidence that chloroplastic and cytosolic pea (Pisum sativum L.)
