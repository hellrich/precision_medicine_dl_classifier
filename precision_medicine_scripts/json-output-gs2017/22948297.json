This study aimed to elucidate the antitumor activity of AZ64 and             its mechanism of action against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our results             demonstrate that AZ64 has a potent anti-proliferative effect on NSCLC cells and             acts in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that AZ64 suppresses             the anchorage-independent growth and invasion of NSCLC cells. InÂ vivo experiments             demonstrated that AZ64 significantly reduced the tumor growth of NSCLC xenografts             in nude mice and was well-tolerated. Mechanistic experiments revealed that AZ64             induced the G2/M arrest of NSCLC cells by the accumulation of phospho-cdc2 (Tyr15)             at the G2/M transition, following the downregulation of Cdc25C expression. Collectively,             our data demonstrate that AZ64 is a potential antitumor drug that may be used             for the treatment of NSCLC, which functions by targeting the G2/M transition via             the inhibition of the dephosphorylation of phospho-cdc2 (Tyr15).","title":"Antitumor activity of AZ64 via G2/M arrest in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22948297"}
