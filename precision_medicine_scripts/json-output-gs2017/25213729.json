Simple and multiple analyses were performed to determine the association between Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis and the BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC.\nHashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis was present in 11.5% of patients (204/1780) with PTC. Multiple logistic regressions showed that BRAF(V600E) (odds ratio [OR] \u003d 0.493; 95% confidence interval [CI] \u003d 0.360-0.678) and the female sex (OR \u003d 7.146; 95% CI \u003d 3.408-18.347) were independent factors associated with Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis in PTC. BRAF(V600E) mutation and the Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis-negative PTC group were associated with aggressive disease (OR \u003d 3.069; 95% CI \u003d 1.654-5.916).\nHashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis was associated less frequently with BRAF(V600E) , and frequently with the female sex in patients with PTC. Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis and BRAF(V600E) status may help to predict clinical outcome of PTC.","title":"Combined effect of Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis and BRAF(V600E) mutation status on aggressiveness in papillary thyroid cancer.","pubmedId":"25213729"}
