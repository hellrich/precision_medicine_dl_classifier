NAION is very rarely reported in association with raised intraocular pressure. In contrast to optical coherence tomography, the failure of scanning laser polarimetry to detect axonal swelling was another interesting finding. Possible reasoning for these observations is discussed.","title":"Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy precipitated by acute primary angle closure.","pubmedId":"20689205"}
