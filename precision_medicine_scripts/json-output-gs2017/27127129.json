The PIK3CA mutations were indicated only in males (3% of all males). One of the patients was reported to be a non-smoker with adenocarcinoma (AC; 2.5% of the AC group), however, the other two patients were smokers with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 3.4% of SCC group).\nThis is the first report of the presence of PIK3CA gene mutation in CNS-metastatic lesions of NSCLC worldwide that could broaden therapeutic choices in such patients.","title":"PIK3CA Mutations Detected in Patients with Central Nervous System Metastases of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.","pubmedId":"27127129"}
