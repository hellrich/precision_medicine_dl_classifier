Plasma levels of VEGF and sFlt-1 were determined by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.\nThere was a positive relationship between plasma level of sFlt-1 and serum level of CEA (p \u003d 0.13). The other combinations did not show any statistical correlations. Also, in terms of the doubling time (DT), there was a positive relationship between the sFlt1-DT and the CEA-DT (p \u003d 0.04). The levels of VEGF tended to change in accordance with the efficacy of chemotherapy. In contrast, plasma levels of sFlt-1 increased in patients with the progressive disease, whereas the levels did not decrease in patients with the partial response.\nThese results suggested that (1) VEGF may be a useful tumor marker during the chemotherapy in patients, whose CEA and CA19-9 are below the cutoff, and (2) the shrinkage of liver metastases may not cause a decrease in sFlt-1 or the half-life of sFlt-1 may be considerably long.","title":"[The relationship between plasma level of VEGF or soluble Flt-1 and efficacy of hepatic arterial chemotherapy in patients with liver metastasis of colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"17212123"}
