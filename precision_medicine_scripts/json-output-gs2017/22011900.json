DNA methylation is characterized by the addition of methyl groups in cytosines within CpG islands in the promoter gene. DNA methylation can decrease the expression of tumor suppressor genes and contribute to the development of neoplastic lesions. The aim of study was to evaluate the methylation pattern of the tumor suppressor genes P16 (CDKN2A), P21 (CDKN1A), P27 (CDKN1B), P53 (TP53) and RB1 in OM and dental pulp. Methylation was evaluated using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The transcription was studied in some cases by using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. A higher frequency of unmethylated P27, P53, and RB1 samples was observed in the OM when compared with the dental pulp. OM expressed mRNA of all the genes evaluated. Considering all the samples together, the expression of Rb was higher in the unmethylated samples compared with the partially methylated samples. This investigation revealed hypomethylation of the genes P27, P53, and RB1 in OM. In addition, methylation of tumor suppressor genes was found to be an usual event in normal dental pulp.","title":"Hypomethylation of tumor suppressor genes in odontogenic myxoma.","pubmedId":"22011900"}
