Resected pancreatic tissue sections (n \u003d 40) and FNA samples (n \u003d 65) were stained for clusterin-beta, MUC4, survivin, and mesothelin. For each biomarker, the staining patterns in adenocarcinoma and in reactive ductal epithelium were evaluated and compared. Clusterin-beta stained reactive ductal epithelium significantly more frequently than pancreatic adenocarcinoma (P \u003c .001). In comparison, MUC4 and mesothelin were expressed more frequently in pancreatic adenocarcinoma on tissue sections. Positive staining for MUC4 (91% vs 0%; P \u003c .001) and mesothelin (62% vs 0%; P \u003d .01) and absence of staining for clusterin-beta (90% vs 7%; P \u003c .001) were noted significantly more frequently in adenocarcinoma cells than in reactive cells in FNA samples. Clusterin-beta and MUC4 can help distinguish reactive ductal epithelial cells from the cells of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in FNA samples.","title":"Biomarkers in Diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma in fine-needle aspirates.","pubmedId":"17019794"}
