No significantly elevated bFGF levels were found in the veins draining the tumours compared with arterial samples in our patient population. This suggests that, in contrast to what is generally presumed, serum bFGF levels might also be derived from other sources besides the tumour, e.g., platelets.","title":"Circulating basic fibroblast growth factor is partly derived from the tumour in patients with colon, cervical and ovarian cancer.","pubmedId":"15302993"}
