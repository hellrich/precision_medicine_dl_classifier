The possibility of dissociating the mitogenic activity of basic FGF (FGF2) from its urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)-inducing capacity both at pharmacological and structural levels prompted us to evaluate the role of these autophosphorylation sites in transducing FGF2-mediated uPA upregulation. To this purpose, L6 myoblasts transfected with either wild-type (wt) or various FGFR1 mutants were evaluated for the capacity to upregulate uPA production by FGF2. uPA was induced in cells transfected with wt-FGFR1, FGFR1-Y463F, -Y585F, -Y730F, -Y766F, or -Y583/585F mutants. In contrast, uPA upregulation was prevented in L6 cells transfected with FGFR1-Y463/583/585/730F mutant (FGFR1-4F) or with FGFR1-Y463/583/585/730/766F mutant (FGFR1-5F) that retained instead a full mitogenic response to FGF2; however, preservation of residue Y730 in FGFR1-Y463/583/585F mutant (FGFR1-3F) and FGFR1-Y463/583/585/766F mutant (FGFR1-4Fbis) allows the receptor to transduce uPA upregulation. Wild-type FGFR1, FGFR1-3F, and FGFR1-4F similarly bind to a 90-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein and activate Shc, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)2, and JunD after stimulation with FGF2. These data, together with the capacity of the ERK kinase inhibitor PD 098059 to prevent ERK2 activation and uPA upregulation in wt-FGFR1 cells, suggest that signaling through the Ras/Raf-1/ERK kinase/ERK/JunD pathway is necessary but not sufficient for uPA induction in L6 transfectants. Accordingly, FGF2 was able to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation, but not uPA upregulation, in L6 cells transfected with the FGFR1-Y463/730F mutant, whereas the FGFR1-Y583/585/730F mutant was fully active. We conclude that different tyrosine autophosphorylation requirements in FGFR1 mediate cell proliferation and uPA upregulation induced by FGF2 in L6 cells. In particular, phosphorylation of either Y463 or Y730, dispensable for mitogenic signaling, represents an absolute requirement for FGF2-mediated uPA induction.","title":"Different tyrosine autophosphorylation requirements in fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 mediate urokinase-type plasminogen activator induction and mitogenesis.","pubmedId":"9880324"}
