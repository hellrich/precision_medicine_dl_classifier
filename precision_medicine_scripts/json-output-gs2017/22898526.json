Very few data, however, are available regarding the application of this technology in the chest during anatomic lung resection. In the present review, we evaluated the use of energy-based fusion and lung sealants during anatomic lung resection.\nWe performed a review of case series and published studies to evaluate the use of energy-based coagulative fusion technology and lung sealants during anatomic lung resection. We then used energy-based coagulative fusion technology during anatomic lung resection (segmentectomy or lobectomy) in 316 cases from 2008 to 2011. Two energy applications were applied to the arterial and venous branches before vessel division.\nIn the first 12 cases, we used a device with a small curved jaw (range, 3.3-4.7 mm). Two partial venous dehiscences were noted and controlled intraoperatively. For the remaining cases, we used a larger jaw (6 mm Ã— 22 mm) with no arterial or venous dehiscence occurring (vessels ranged from 0.4 to 1.2 cm). Autologous or synthetic tissue sealants applied to the parenchymal staple lines might reduce the severity and duration of perioperative air leaks. Suture line buttressing with pericardial or absorbable biosynthetic polyester strips might reduce the severity of air leaks in patients with severe emphysema undergoing anatomic lung resection or lung volume reduction surgery.\nThe bipolar tissue fusion system provides a safe and effective technique for the division of the pulmonary arterial and venous branches during anatomic lung resection. Surgical sealants and buttressing adjuncts might reduce perioperative air leak potential.","title":"Use of energy-based coagulative fusion technology and lung sealants during anatomic lung resection.","pubmedId":"22898526"}
