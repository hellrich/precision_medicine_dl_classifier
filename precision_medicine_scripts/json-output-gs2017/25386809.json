This article reports the case of a 33-year-old woman diagnosed with breast cancer and referred for oncofertility counseling before her treatment. Despite a previous negative cancer workup, a transvaginal ultrasound scan, performed for antral follicle count as part of the initial ovarian reserve assessment, revealed a synchronous ovarian adenocarcinoma. A BRCA1 mutation was confirmed weeks later. This report highlights the role of transvaginal ultrasound in the initial evaluation and reviews the risks associated with fertility preservation in breast cancer patients.","title":"Serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary diagnosed during ultrasound evaluation for fertility preservation.","pubmedId":"25386809"}
