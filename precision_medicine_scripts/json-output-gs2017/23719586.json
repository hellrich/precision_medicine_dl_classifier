Although Pdx1-Cre is expressed in the embryonic endoderm, which gives rise to all pancreatic lineages, the possible consequences of KRAS(G12D) expression in the endocrine compartment have never been finely explored.\nWe examined by histology whether Pdx1-driven expression of KRAS(G12D) could induce islets of Langerhans defects.\nWe observed in Pdx1-Cre; LSL-KRAS(G12D) early disorganization of the endocrine compartment including i) hyperplasia affecting all the endocrine lineages, ii) ectopic onset of Ck19-positive (ductal-like) structures within the endocrine islets, and iii) the presence of islet cells co-expressing glucagon and insulin, all occurring before the onset of ducts lesions.\nThis work indicates that expression of KRAS(G12D) in Pdx1-expressing cells during embryogenesis affects the endocrine pancreas, and highlights the need to deepen possible consequences on both glucose metabolism and PDAC initiation.","title":"The conditional expression of KRAS G12D in mouse pancreas induces disorganization of endocrine islets prior the onset of ductal pre-cancerous lesions.","pubmedId":"23719586"}
