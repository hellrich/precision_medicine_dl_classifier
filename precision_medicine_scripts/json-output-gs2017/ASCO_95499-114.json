FGFR1 amplification has emerged as a potential biomarker. This study aimed to explore clinicopathologic characteristics of FGFR1 amplification in Chinese SCC patients and further explore the correlation between FGFR1 amplification and EGFR mutations.  Methods:    One hundred seventy-seven SCC patients were included in this retrospective study. Gene copy number of FGFR1 and EGFR mutations were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), respectively.  Results:    FGFR1 amplifications were detected in 24.9% (44/177) Chinese SCC patients. FGFR1 amplification in SCC was more common in male (28.0%, 40/143) and smokers (28.7%, 39/136) than female (11.8%, 4/34, p\u003d0.049) and nonsmokers (12.2%, 5/41, p\u003d0.032). FGFR1 amplification and EGFR mutations were mutually exclusive (p\u003d0.006), fourty-one of 139(29.4%) patients with wild-type EGFR had FGFR1 amplification, while 3 of 38 (7.9%) patients with EGFR mutation had FGFR1 amplification.  Conclusions:    FGFR1 amplification was common in Chinese squamous cell lung cancer, and mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations.","title":"FGFR1 amplification and EGFR mutation in Chinese squamous cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_95499-114"}
