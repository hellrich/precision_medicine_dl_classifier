In the current study we evaluated the clinical phenotype and germline MET mutation of 3 new HPRC families. We describe the early onset clinical features of HPRC.\nWe identified new HPRC families of Italian (family 177), Spanish (family 223) and Cuban (family 268) descent. We evaluated their clinical features, performed MET mutation analysis by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequencing, and estimated age dependent penetrance and survival using Kaplan-Meier analysis. We characterized renal tumors by histology and fluorescence in situ hybridization.\nIdentical germline MET c.3522G --\u003e A mutations (V1110I) were identified in families 177 and 268 but no evidence of a founder effect was found. Affected members of family 223 carried a germline c.3906G --\u003e C.3522G --\u003e A MET mutation (V1238I). Age dependent penetrance but not survival was significantly earlier for the c.3522G --\u003eA mutation than for the c.3906G --\u003e A mutation in these HPRC families. Trisomy of chromosome 7 and papillary renal carcinoma type 1 histology were detected in papillary renal tumors.\nHPRC can occur in an early onset form. The median age for renal tumor development in these 3 HPRC families was 46 to 63 years. HPRC associated papillary renal tumors may be aggressive and metastasize, leading to mortality. Median survival age was 60 to 70 years. Families with identical germline mutations in MET do not always share a common ancestor. HPRC is characterized by germline mutations in MET and papillary type 1 renal tumor histology.","title":"Early onset hereditary papillary renal carcinoma: germline missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the met proto-oncogene.","pubmedId":"15371818"}
