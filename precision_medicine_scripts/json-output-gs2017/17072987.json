In the p53 codon 72 genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP.\nPatients with gastric cancer had a significantly higher frequency of the homozygous proline (Pro) allele than the control (P\u003d0.032). Patients with AGC had a significantly higher frequency of the Arg/Arg (arginine) allele (P\u003d0.038) than EGC and a similar Pro/Pro allele. The signet ring cell type had a higher frequency of the Pro/Pro allele than other types (P\u003d0.031). The Pro/Pro genotype carries a 3.9-fold increased risk of developing gastric cancer (95% CI, 1.3-15.4, P\u003d0.039) when compared to Arg/Arg and Arg/Pro genotypes and to develop EGC is a 5.25 fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.8-19.6, P\u003d0.021).\nThe Pro/Pro genotype of the p53 codon 72 polymorphism carries a higher risk for gastric cancer in general and is also associated with a much higher risk for EGC than AGC.","title":"A p53 genetic polymorphism of gastric cancer: difference between early gastric cancer and advanced gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"17072987"}
