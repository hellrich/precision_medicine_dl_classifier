This therapeutic regimen has the potential to be a revolutionary treatment for which the most appropriate indication is lung adenocarcinoma. Currently, there is no difference in the treatment of brain metastasis, especially multiple brain metastases, in patients with lung adenocarcinoma of patients with other lung carcinomas. Furthermore, limited clinical trials that combine a TKI with WBRT to treat multiple lung adenocarcinoma metastases have been conducted, and many clinical questions remain unanswered. Lung adenocarcinoma has a high propensity to metastasize to the brain, and targeted therapy has been widely used; however, clinical trials are necessary to provide data to support the combination of erlotinib and WBRT.
