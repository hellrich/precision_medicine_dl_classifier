Mutations and/or deletions within the tumor suppressor gene neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) are associated with meningioma development and progression. We studied 29 meningioma samples by cytogenetic analysis and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) using a locus-specific probe for the NF2 gene region. We detected loss of the NF2 gene in all samples except for one. In 10 of the 29 samples, karyotypic analyses confirmed the I-FISH results and revealed additional numerical and/or structural rearrangements in nine of them. Our study confirmed: i) the limited role of banding cytogenetics in assessing chromosomal rearrangements in meningioma, as this tumor is hard to be grown in cell culture; ii) we could show that two-color I-FISH is well-suited for NF2-deletion screening. Our results were in accordance with those of comparable studies, even though the frequency of 97.0% of meningiomas with NF2 deletions is exceptionally high in the studied Sudanese patients.
