Amplification of the HER-2 gene has been reported in lung cancer, where it has been associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated whether the four polymorphisms (-3444C\u003eT, -1985 G\u003eT, I655A A\u003eG and P1170A C\u003eG) of the HER-2 gene are associated with the risk of lung cancer in Korean populations.\nThe frequencies of 4 polymorphisms of the HER-2 gene were examined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism or the single-nucleotide polymorphism-identification technology assay in the 407 lung cancer patients and 407 healthy controls.\nThe frequencies of the 4 polymorphisms were not significantly different between patient and control groups in overall subjects. However, in the subgroup analysis, the 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (-3444C\u003eT, -1985G\u003eT and P1170A C\u003eG) showed statistically significant differences in the subgroups of females, non-smokers, and non-drinkers (p \u003c 0.05). Additionally, we found the association between the risk of lung cancer and the polymorphisms of HER-2 gene in non-smoker subgroups with adenocarcinoma (p \u003c 0.05).\nOur results suggest that the polymorphisms of the HER-2 gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to lung cancer in females, non-smokers and non-drinkers subgroups in the Korean population.","title":"The genetic polymorphisms of HER-2 and the risk of lung cancer in a Korean population.","pubmedId":"19055823"}
