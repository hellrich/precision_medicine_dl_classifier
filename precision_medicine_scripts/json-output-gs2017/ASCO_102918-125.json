Nanotechnology is the exciting field focused on man-made materials in the size range of 1-100 nanometers (nm). Nanoparticles (NPs) are on the scale of many cellular-level processes and hence are attractive for targeting breast cancer. Emerging nanotechnologies promise new approaches to early detection and treatment of breast cancer. Our group has reported Gold Speckled Silica NPs (GSS) as multimodal contrast agents for fluorescence, magnetic resonance and photoacoustic tomographic (PAT) imaging. The near infrared (NIR) optical absorption property of these particles makes them potentially useful for therapeutic applications such as thermal ablation of tumors. Fulfilling the promise of nanotechnologies for patients with metastatic breast cancer, necessitates delivery of nanomaterials to sites of breast cancer. Now we have focused on the cancer metabolism, we have recently developed active targeting NPs with surface functionalizing agent such as glucose conjugated NPs. We hypothesize that active targeting NPs is more incorporated into cancer cells compared to normal NPs.  Methods:  Human breast cancer cells, BT474, were incubated with active targeting NPs or normal NPs (as control). The tumor cell uptake was assessed using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy experiments.  Results:  Uptake of active targeting NPs was significantly higher than uptake of normal NPs.  Conclusions:  Active targeting NPs can be used as suitable targeting NPs for development of imaging agents for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Evolving bio-nanotechnologies such as active targeting NPs promise to enhance the early detection and non-invasive treatment of breast cancer.","title":"Active targeting nanoparticle for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.","pubmedId":"ASCO_102918-125"}
