Combined with clinical postoperative follow-up data, the expression of TGF-β1 and FGFR4 in HCC and the relationship with the prognosis of patients were analyzed by statistically.\nThe positive expression rate of TGF-β1 was 84.1% (106/126) in tumors, and that in peritumoral liver tissues was 64.3% (81/126); the positive expression rate of FGFR4 in tumors was 74.6% (94/126) and that in peritumoral liver tissues was 57.1% (72/126). The expression of TGF-β1 and FGFR4 in the carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in peritumoral liver tissues (p \u003c 0.05). Intratumoral TGF-β1 and FGFR4 expression was associated with TNM stage (p \u003c 0.05). TGF-β1 and FGFR4 expression levels didn\u0027t significantly correlate with other clinicopathological parameters, including age, sex, tumor size, serum AFP level, tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, etc. (p \u003e 0.05). TGF-β1 expression was positively correlated with FGFR4 expression (r \u003d 0.595, p \u003c 0.05). Patients with positive FGFR4 or TGF-β1 expression had shorter overall survival compared with negative expression (p \u003c 0.05).\nThe expression of TGF-β1 and FGFR4 could make synergy on the occurrence and progression of HCC, and may be used as prognosis indicators for HCC patients.","title":"FGFR4 and TGF-β1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma: correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis.","pubmedId":"24324363"}
