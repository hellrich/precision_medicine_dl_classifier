Long-term survivors of Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma and childhood cancers have two-fold to more than seven-fold increased risks for late cardiac deaths after total tumour doses of 30-40 Gy, given in 2 Gy fractions, where large volumes of heart were included in the field. Increased cardiac mortality is also seen in women irradiated for breast cancer. Breast doses are generally 40-50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, but only a small part of the heart is included in the treatment fields and mean heart doses rarely exceeded 10-15 Gy, even with older techniques. The relative risks of cardiac mortality (1.1-1.4) are consequently lower than for Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma survivors. Some epidemiological studies show increased risks of cardiac death after accidental or environmental total body exposures to much lower radiation doses. The mechanisms whereby these cardiac effects occur are not fully understood and different mechanisms are probably involved after high therapeutic doses to the heart, or part of the heart, than after low total body exposures. These various mechanisms probably result in different cardiac pathologies, e.g. coronary artery atherosclerosis leading to myocardial infarct, versus microvascular damage and fibrosis leading to congestive heart failure. Experimental studies can help to unravel some of these mechanisms and may identify suitable strategies for managing or inhibiting CVD. In this overview, the main epidemiological and clinical evidence for radiation-induced CVD is summarised. Experimental data shedding light on some of the underlying pathologies and possible targets for intervention are also discussed.","title":"Understanding radiation-induced cardiovascular damage and strategies for intervention.","pubmedId":"23876528"}
