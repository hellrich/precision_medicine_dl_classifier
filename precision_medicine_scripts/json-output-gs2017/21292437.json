However, its role in human pancreatic carcinoma has not been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of EphB2 in human pancreatic carcinoma CFPAC-1 cells. A lentivirus-based RNA interference (RNAi) vector was designed, synthesized and transfected into CFPAC-1 cells to inhibit EphB2 expression. WST-8 based Colorimetric Assay Cell Counting kit 8 (CCK-8) in vitro and xenograft transplantation model in nude mice was used to evaluate cell proliferation and growth respectively. Cell-cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). RT-PCR and Western blot were used to assess mRNA expression and protein levels. EphB2 expression was significantly suppressed both in mRNA and protein levels using the lentivirus-based EphB2 RNAi in CFPAC-1 cells (P\u003c0.01, P\u003c0.01). Silencing EphB2 stimulated cell growth in vitro (P\u003c0.05) and proliferation in vivo (P\u003c0.01) versus Control RNAi. EphB2 RNAi significantly increased S phase cells from 18.15 to 27.18% (P\u003c0.05), and significantly decreased G1 phase cells from 72.93 to 57.61% compared with Control RNAi (P\u003c0.05). In addition, decreased apoptosis was observed in CFPAC-1 EphB2 RNAi cells compared with Control RNAi cells (P\u003c0.01). The apoptosis rate was 1.63% and 7.44%, respectively. Silencing EphB2 increased CyclinD1, cyclindependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and Bcl-2 expression in both mRNA and protein levels compared with Control RNAi. A lentivirus-based EphB2 RNAi efficiently inhibited EphB2 gene and its protein expression. Silencing EphB2 stimulated pancreatic carcinoma growth by increasing cell proliferation through G1/S phase breakthrough, which relied on a CyclinD1/CDK6 cell-cycle regulated signal. Similarly, EphB2 inhibition also reduced CFPAC-1 cells apoptosis by up-regulating Bcl-2 expression. Thus, at least in the context of pancreatic carcinoma CFPAC-1 cells, EphB2 plays a tumor suppressor role in cell proliferation and apoptosis.","title":"Promoted cancer growth by stimulating cell proliferation and decreasing apoptosis using a lentivirus-based EphB2 RNAi in pancreatic carcinoma CFPAC-1 cells.","pubmedId":"21292437"}
