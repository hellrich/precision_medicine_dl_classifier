Little information is available regarding the response and progression-free survival (PFS) in platinum-based chemotherapy (CT) versus EGFR-TKIs in the presence or absence of KRAS mutation, particularly in patients without EGFR mutation.\nFrom 2007 to 2010, 353 patients with NSCLC were treated with first-line CT, EGFR-TKIs were used in the second or third line of treatment. Tests were performed for EGFR and KRAS mutation and the results of the mutations were obtained 3 to 4 months after the start of the treatment. We analyzed clinical characteristics, mutation profile, response and PFS to CT and EGFR-TKIs, and overall survival. The protocol is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01023828.\nPresence of the wild-type (WT) KRAS was independently associated with increased response rate to first-line CT when compared with KRAS mutation (41.4% vs. 14.7%; P\u003d0.001). The EGFR mutation (57.8% vs. 11.7%; P\u003c0.001) and WT-KRAS (39.6% vs. 3.3%; P\u003d0.001) were associated with the EGFR-TKIs response. PFS of patients with WT-EGFR and KRAS mutation treated with EGFR-TKIs was shorter when compared with patients with WT-EGFR and WT-KRAS (P\u003c0.001).\nKRAS mutation status is a good biomarker for response to EGFR-TKIs in patients with NSCLC. KRAS mutational status could impact the decision to give CT or EGFR-TKIs as a second line of treatment to patients with NSCLC, particularly in patients with WT-EGFR.","title":"KRAS mutation as the biomarker of response to chemotherapy and EGFR-TKIs in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: clues for its potential use in second-line therapy decision making.","pubmedId":"23538866"}
