Using next-generation sequencing, we screened 739 mutation hotspots in 46 cancer-related genes in EGFR L858R-mutant lung adenocarcinomas from 29 patients who received EGFR-TKI therapy; 13 had short (\u003c 3 months) and 16 had long (\u003e 1 year) progression-free survival (PFS). We discovered MLH1 V384D as a genetic variant enriched in the group of patients with short PFS. Next, we investigated this genetic variation in 158 lung adenocarcinomas with the EGFR L858R mutation and found 14 (8.9%) patients had MLH1 V384D; available blood or non-tumor tissues from patients were also tested positive for MLH1 V384D. Patients with MLH1 V384D had a significantly shorter median PFS than those without (5.1 vs. 10.6 months; P\u003d 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that MLH1 V384D polymorphism was an independent predictor for a reduced PFS time (hazard ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 7.2; P\u003d 0.001). In conclusion, MLH1 V384D polymorphism is associated with primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR L858R-positive lung adenocarcinoma and may potentially be a novel biomarker to guide treatment decisions.
