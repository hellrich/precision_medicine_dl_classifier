Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men with type 2 diabetes is associated with obesity but not duration of diabetes, elevated glycosylated hemoglobin, or the presence of microvascular complications of diabetes. Recent data show that hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is also observed frequently in nondiabetics with the metabolic syndrome or obesity, but it is not associated with type 1 diabetes. Low testosterone concentrations in men with type 2 diabetes have also been related to a higher C-reactive protein concentrations, lower hematocrit, increased total and regional adiposity, lower bone mineral density, and erectile dysfunction. This article discusses the pathophysiology of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men with type 2 diabetes and its signs and symptoms. Clinical trials are required to determine whether testosterone replacement therapy alleviates insulin resistance, inflammation, and symptoms related to sexual dysfunction care.","title":"Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men with type 2 diabetes.","pubmedId":"19491539"}
