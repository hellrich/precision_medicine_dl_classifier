The crude mortality rate of lung cancer was 78.06 per 100,000 from 2001 to 2013, with the increasing rate of 4.77%. The mortality rate of lung cancer in males and females were about 108.90 per 100,000 and 26.08 per 100,000 with the increasing rate of 4.24% and 6.91%, respectively. During the thirteen years, the PYLL and average PYLL (APYLL) of lung cancer were 3 721.71 person-years and 8.58 years. The APYLL of lung cancer in females (15.94 years) was higher than that in males (7.87 years). The WPYLL and the average WPYLL (AWPYLL) of lung cancer were 1161.00 person-years and 2.68 years, respectively. The AWPYLL of lung cancer was also higher in females than in males. The direct economic burden of lung cancer from 2001 to 2010 in Jinchang cohort was 6309.39 Yuan per case with no increased trend.\nLung cancer is the main health problem in Jinchang cohort, causing heavy disease burden.","title":"[Disease burden of lung cancer in Jinchang cohort].","pubmedId":"27005526"}
