In women, 120 cases of congestive heart failure occurred during 35 563 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for multiple confounders, risk for congestive heart failure was lower among men at all levels of alcohol consumption compared with men who consumed less than 1 drink/wk. The hazard ratio for congestive heart failure was lowest among men who consumed 8 to 14 drinks/wk (0.41 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.81]) compared with those who consumed less than 1 drink/wk. In women, the age-adjusted hazard ratio for congestive heart failure was lowest among those who consumed 3 to 7 drinks/wk (0.49 [CI, 0.25 to 0.96]) compared with those who consumed less than 1 drink/wk. However, after adjustment for multiple predictors of congestive heart failure, this association was no longer statistically significant.\nIn the community, alcohol consumption is not associated with increased risk for congestive heart failure, even among heavy drinkers (\u003e or \u003d 15 drinks/wk in men and \u003e or \u003d 8 drinks/wk in women). To the contrary, when consumed in moderation, alcohol appears to protect against congestive heart failure.","title":"Alcohol consumption and risk for congestive heart failure in the Framingham Heart Study.","pubmedId":"11827493"}
