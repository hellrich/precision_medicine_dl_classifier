A homozygous point mutation of the N-ras gene was identified at codon 61 in BON cells in conjunction with overexpression of N-ras mRNA and protein. BON cells also exhibited increased expression of c-myc and cdc2 kinase mRNA and protein; TGF-beta 1, p53 and retinoblastoma (RB) mRNA and protein levels were decreased. In addition, increased expression of the mdm2 oncogene and both the truncated and the wild-type RB protein were noted in BON. SIM cells exhibited moderately increased N-ras and c-myc mRNA levels along with decreased levels of RB mRNA and protein. Similar to BON and SIM, analysis of STAN showed increased N-ras and c-myc levels. Our data show multiple molecular changes in the three human endocrine tumours with the BON cell line exhibiting the most dramatic changes. Furthermore, our data suggest the existence of different molecular pathways in the pathogenesis of endocrine tumours. These cell lines will provide unique in vitro models to further analyse the significance of these molecular alterations.","title":"Analysis of multiple molecular changes in human endocrine tumours.","pubmedId":"7952399"}
