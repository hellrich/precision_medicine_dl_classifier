Intensity and pattern of expression were evaluated. Molecular analysis to identify KIT mutations was performed in 15 selected cases (tumour-rich areas \u003e50%). KIT immunostaining score and pattern were statistically related to patients\u0027 age, sex, diagnostic category, presence of relapse, disease-free survival, presence of metastases, metastasis-free survival, limbal versus nonlimbal tumour location and thickness of melanomas.\nKIT stains were documented in 48% of melanomas, 50% of PAMs and 24% of nevi. The mean score of KIT staining in the melanomas/PAMs group was significantly different from nevi (p \u003d 0.0076). No statistically significant differences were detected between either c-kit immunostaining score or pattern and each of the other clinico-pathologic parameters considered. No KIT gene mutations were detected in melanomas and nevi. A silent mutation/polymorphism in KIT exon 13 was found in one PAM.\nDespite the high level of KIT immunostains in PAMs and melanomas, this parameter seems not to be a good predictor of the presence of molecular mutations. KIT-activating mutations should be considered an uncommon event in this tumour.","title":"C-Kit SCF receptor (CD117) expression and KIT gene mutation in conjunctival pigmented lesions.","pubmedId":"23742652"}
