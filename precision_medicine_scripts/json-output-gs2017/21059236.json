The gene expression is quantified by normalization to one or more reference genes which are presumed stably expressed throughout a given experiment. The aim of this study was to validate a standardized experimental setup to identifying reference genes for normalization of qRT-PCR in the metastatic and non-metastatic colon cancer.\nIn this study, expression of 16 commonly used reference genes was quantified in tumour tissue and individual-matched normal mucosa in 18 non-metastatic colon cancer patients and 20 colon cancer patients with distant metastases using TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA). The expression stability was determined and compared by means of geNorm and NormFinder.\nTwo pairs of genes, HPRT1/PPIA and IPO8/PPIA, were identified to be suitable to normalize gene expression data in metastatic and non-metastatic colon cancer patients, according to geNorm and NormFinder respectively.\nWe propose a standardized approach of finding the most suitable reference gene(s) in every qRT-PCR experiment using TLDA.","title":"Evaluation of suitable reference genes for normalization of real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis in colon cancer.","pubmedId":"21059236"}
