We analyzed lung LCNECs to identify biologically relevant genomic alterations.\nWe performed targeted capture sequencing of all the coding exons of 244 cancer-related genes on 78 LCNEC samples (65 surgically resected cases, including 10 LCNECs combined with non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] types analyzed separately, and biopsies of 13 advanced cases). Frequencies of genetic alterations were compared with those of 141 SCLCs (50 surgically resected cases and biopsies of 91 advanced cases).\nWe found a relatively high prevalence of inactivating mutations in TP53 (71%) and RB1 (26%), but the mutation frequency in RB1 was lower than that in SCLCs (40%, P \u003d 0.039). Additionally, genetic alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were detected in 12 (15%) of the tumors: PIK3CA 3%, PTEN 4%, AKT2 4%, RICTOR 5% and mTOR 1%. Other activating alterations were detected in KRAS (6%), FGFR1 (5%), KIT (4%), ERBB2 (4%), HRAS (1%) and EGFR (1%). Five of ten cases of LCNECs combined with NSCLCs harbored previously reported driver gene alterations, all of which were shared between the two components. The median concordance rate of candidate somatic mutations between the two components was 71% (range 60-100%).\nLCNEC have a similar genomic profile to SCLC, including promising therapeutic targets such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and other gene alterations. Sequencing-based molecular profiling is warranted in LCNEC for targeted therapies.","title":"Genomic profiling of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"27507618"}
