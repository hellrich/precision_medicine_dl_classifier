Surgery for operable cancer in the head of the pancreas typically involves an open pancreaticoduodenectomy with a post-operative median survival of 21 months. Newer surgical techniques, however, aim to improve patient outcomes in terms of both their hospital experience and better oncological results. This article focuses on the evidence to date for some of these surgical techniques including laparoscopic and robotic surgery, the no-touch technique, venous and arterial resection, intra-operative radiofrequency ablation and intra-operative irreversible electroporation. With the increased use of these techniques we hope to see better quality of life and survival for these patients.
