Next-generation sequencing was performed for 4561 exons of 287 cancer-related genes and for 47 introns of 19 genes on indexed, adaptor-ligated, hybridization-captured libraries using a proprietary sequencing system (the Illumina HiSeq 2000).\nGenomic profiles were generated successfully from 16 of 16 (100%) pulmonary FNAs, which included 14 nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and 2 small cell lung cancers (SCLCs). The NSCLC group included 6 adenocarcinomas, 5 squamous cell carcinomas, and 3 NSCLCs not otherwise specified. Genomic profiles were successfully obtained from 23 of 23 (100%) pancreatic FNAs and from 5 of 5 (100%) matched pancreatic primary tumors, which included 17 ductal adenocarcinomas, 3 mucinous adenocarcinomas, 2 adenocarcinomas NOS, and 1 neuroendocrine tumor. Eighty-one genomic alterations were identified in the 16 pulmonary FNAs (average, 5.1 genomic alterations per patient); and the most common genomic alterations were TP53, RB1, SOX2, PIK3CA, and KRAS. Eighty-seven genomic alterations were identified in the 23 pancreatic tumor FNAs (average, 3.8 genomic alterations per patient); and the most common genomic alterations were KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A/B, SMAD4, and PTEN. Among the pancreatic tumors, there was 100% concordance of 20 genomic alterations that were identified in 5 patient-matched FNA and surgical primary tumor pairs.\nThe authors were able to perform next-generation sequencing reliably on FNAs of pulmonary and pancreatic tumors, and the genomic alterations discovered correlated well with those identified in matched resected pancreatic tumors.","title":"Clinical next-generation sequencing successfully applied to fine-needle aspirations of pulmonary and pancreatic neoplasms.","pubmedId":"23893923"}
