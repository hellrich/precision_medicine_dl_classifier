Mutations found in the tyrosine kinase membrane receptors c-kit and pdgfra are associated with clinical and pathological characteristics of GIST. New drugs that inhibit the expression of these oncogenes at the molecular level substantially improve the quality of life for patients with this tumor. It is therefore essential for patient care in Panama that genetic analysis of GIST tumors continues to develop from the pilot study presented herein into routine clinical use. This study evaluated 39 cases of GIST in Panama, using samples archived at the Instituto Oncológico Nacional from 1994 to 2004. DNA from paraffin‑embedded tumor tissues was isolated and amplified for the exons of c-kit and pdgfra associated with a high frequency of mutations. Direct PCR sequencing of specific exons was performed, and those with different alleles were cloned and re-sequenced. Amino acid sequences were inferred from DNA and aligned to Genbank reference sequences to determine the position and type of mutation. The highest frequency of mutations was found in exon 11 of the c-kit gene (70%). Mutations found in this exon were heterogeneous, while only one type of mutation (p.A502_Y503dup) was observed in c-kit exon 9. Mutations in the pdgfra gene constituted several substitutions, with the deletion p.D842V being observed most frequently. The observed GIST-associated mutations were previously described. Four patients with mutations associated with familial GIST were also found. The majority (66%) of patients with mutations in exon 11 (residues 550-591) were considered to be at high risk and 75% of patients with mutations specifically within residues 556-560 (exon 11) were considered to have high-risk GIST. This is the first molecular study of GIST in Central America. It was performed to gain a better understanding of the cancer-associated mutations of KIT and platelet‑derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) receptors. This may aid in the prediction of clinical evolution and guide the use of specific drug treatments in patients with GIST in Panama.","title":"Beginning of personalized medicine in Panama: Molecular and pathological characteristics of gastrointestinal stromal tumors from archival paraffin-embedded tissue.","pubmedId":"22866155"}
