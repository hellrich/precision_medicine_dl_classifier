Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) is a well-documented tumor suppressor gene and is commonly methylated in cervical cancer. However, the relationship between methylated CDKN2A and carcinogenesis in cervical cancer is inconsistent, and the diagnostic accuracy of methylated CDKN2A is underinvestigated. In this study, we attempted to quantify the association between CDKN2A methylation and the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer, and its diagnostic power.\nWe systematically reviewed four electronic databases and identified 26 studies involving 1,490 cervical cancers, 1,291 CINs, and 964 controls. A pooled odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated to evaluate the association between methylated CDKN2A and the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer. Specificity, sensitivity, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the diagnostic odds ratio were computed to assess the effect of methylated CDKN2A in the diagnosis of cervical cancer.\nOur results indicated an upward trend in the methylation frequency of CDKN2A in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer (cancer vs control: OR \u003d23.67, 95% CI \u003d15.54-36.06; cancer vs CIN: OR \u003d2.53, 95% CI \u003d1.79-3.5; CIN vs control: OR \u003d9.68, 95% CI \u003d5.82-16.02). The specificity, sensitivity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99), 0.36 (95% CI: 0.28-0.45), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.95), and 43 (95% CI: 19-98), respectively.\nOur findings indicate that abnormal CDKN2A methylation may be strongly correlated with the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. Our results also demonstrate that CDKN2A methylation might serve as an early detector of cervical cancer. These findings require further confirmation.","title":"The association between methylated CDKN2A and cervical carcinogenesis, and its diagnostic value in cervical cancer: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"27574435"}
