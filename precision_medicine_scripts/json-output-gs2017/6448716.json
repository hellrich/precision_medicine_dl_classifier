Seven of 22 patients (32%) responded and 4 of 22 (18%) had stable disease. Median survival of the entire group was 6 months, and of responders 9.5 months. In 13 patients with localized disease, five responses (38%) were seen and median survival was 7.5 months. Toxicity of the regimen was moderate, being predominantly gastrointestinal and renal. The usefulness of this regimen in localized pancreatic cancer should be explored further.","title":"Phase II trial of streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and 5-fluorouracil in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"6448716"}
