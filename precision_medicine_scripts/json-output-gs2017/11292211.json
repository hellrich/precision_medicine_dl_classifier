The study included 41 patients who met the diagnostic criteria for MCTD and showed abnormal findings on high-resolution CT. The presence, extent, and distribution of various high-resolution CT findings were evaluated. The predominant abnormalities included areas of ground-glass attenuation (n \u003d 41), subpleural micronodules (n \u003d 40), and nonseptal linear opacities (n \u003d 32). Other common findings included peripheral predominance (n \u003d 40), lower lobe predominance (n \u003d 39), intralobular reticular opacities (n \u003d 25), architectural distortion (n \u003d 20), and traction bronchiectasis (n \u003d 18). Less common findings included honeycombing, ill-defined centrilobular nodules, airspace consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, thickening of bronchovascular bundles, bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, and emphysema. Pulmonary involvement of MCTD is characterized by the presence of ground-glass attenuation, nonseptal linear opacities, and peripheral and lower lobe predominance. Ill-defined centrilobular opacities were uncommonly seen.","title":"Pulmonary involvement in mixed connective tissue disease: high-resolution CT findings in 41 patients.","pubmedId":"11292211"}
