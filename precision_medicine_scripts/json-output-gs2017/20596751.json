The anti-neoplastic effects of lopinavir have not been established or studied in brain tumors. Primary cultures of three fetal leptomeninges and 18 meningiomas were treated with lopinavir alone or with PDGF-BB. DNA synthesis was assessed by CyQUANT. Lopinavir effects on basal and PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the Akt-mTOR, MEK1/2-MAPK and STAT3 pathways, phosphorylation of Rb, Caspase 3 activation and reductions in survivin were assessed by Western blots. Lopinavir produced a significant reduction in PDGF-BB stimulation of DNA synthesis in a leptomeningeal culture (P \u003d 0.0013) and 1 of 6 WHO grade I and 1 of 4 grade II meningiomas at 24 h and in 3 of 6 WHO grade I, 4 of 4 grade II and 1 of 1 grade III cell cultures (P \u003d 0.0001) at 72 h. Lopinavir reduced PDGF-BB stimulation of phosphorylation/activation of MAPK in the 22 week fetal leptomeningeal cell cultures and in cells from 1 grade I meningioma at 24 h, but in none of 4 grade I and 5 grade II meningiomas at 6 h. Lopinavir had no notable effect on basal or PDGF-stimulated p-mTOR, p-MEK1/2, or p-STAT3, activation of Caspase 3 or survivin levels. Lopinavir treatment for 24 h had no effect on basal Rb phosphorylation but reduced Rb phosphorylation in all four meningioma cultures. These studies suggest that lopinavir may inhibit meningioma growth, and does so in part by cell cycle arrest. Additional evaluation of lopinavir as a potential adjunct chemotherapy is warranted.","title":"Lopinavir inhibits meningioma cell proliferation by Akt independent mechanism.","pubmedId":"20596751"}
