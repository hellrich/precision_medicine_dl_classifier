The MR image clearly indicated the exact location, size and anatomical relationship of the tumor. Scintigraphic evaluation was useful in suggesting the malignant nature of the tumor and showed no distant metastasis. Both examinations were effective in treating this case.","title":"67Ga citrate and 99mTc(v)-DMSA scintigraphy in a case of maxillary sinus liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"8384871"}
