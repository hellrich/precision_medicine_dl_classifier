In particular, the amplifications and products of oncogenes which code growth factors and receptors can be different indicators of clinical malignancy from the conventional prognostic factors. We investigated the relation of c-erbB-2 and int-2 gene amplification, expression, ER and EGFR with clinical characteristics. In retrospective study, the cumulative 10-year survival rate of patients with c-erbB-2 and int-2 gene amplification was significantly lower than in patients without amplification. In 72 cases with tumor diameter less than 3.0 cm, which can be an indication of breast preservation surgery, the survival rates of patients in these gene amplified groups were significantly lower than in the non-amplified groups. As for prospective study, the results were the same as those from retrospective study. These data show that the cases with these gene amplification have a high biological malignancy and high risk of recurrence to distant organs, despite the small tumor diameter.","title":"[Abnormalities and clinical characteristics of growth factors and receptor systems in breast cancer].","pubmedId":"7913599"}
