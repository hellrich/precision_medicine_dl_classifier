ARHGEF11, which encodes the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 11, was analyzed as a positional candidate gene for this linkage because this protein may stimulate Rho-dependent signals, such as the insulin signaling cascade. The ARHGEF11 gene, and two adjacent genes NTRK1 and INSRR, were sequenced in 24 Pima Indians who were not first-degree relatives. Sequencing of the coding regions, 5\u0027 and 3\u0027 untranslated regions and putative promoter regions of these genes, identified 28 variants in ARHGEF11, 11 variants in NTRK1, and 8 variants in INSSR. These 47 variants, as well as 84 additional public database variants within/between these genes, were genotyped for association analysis in the same group of Pima Indians who had participated in the linkage study (n \u003d 1,228). An R1467H in ARHGEF11, and several additional noncoding variants that were in high linkage disequilibrium with this variant, were nominally associated with young-onset type 2 diabetes (P \u003d 0.01; odds ratio 3.39) after adjusting for sex, family membership, and Pima heritage. The risk allele H had a frequency of 0.10. In a subgroup of 262 nondiabetic, full-heritage Pima Indians who had undergone detailed metabolic testing, the risk allele H also was associated with a lower mean insulin-mediated glucose disposal rate and a lower mean nonoxidative glucose storage rate after adjusting for age, sex, nuclear family membership, and percentage of body fat (P \u003c or \u003d 0.01). These findings suggest that variation within ARHGEF11 nominally increases risk of type 2 diabetes, possibly as a result of increased insulin resistance.","title":"Variants in ARHGEF11, a candidate gene for the linkage to type 2 diabetes on chromosome 1q, are nominally associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians.","pubmedId":"17287471"}
