Our study was to determine the clinical relevance of KRAS mutation detection in mCRC patients treated with cetuximab, and practical application of using predictive biomarkers to select patient in China. Methods: We analyzed tumor samples from 303 patients with colorectal cancer by direct sequencing, to observe the mutations status in exon 2A3 of K-ras gene and exon15 of BRAF gene. And 107 mCRC patients were followed up for their treatment outcome of cetuximab plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Results: KRAS mutations were identified in 37.95% patients with mCRC in exon2/3, which including 9 mutation types. The BRAF V600E mutation was found in 1 of 37 (5.6%) assessable patients received cetuximab. Only one of the 20 patients with a KRAS mutation had a response to cetuximab plus chemotherapy, whereas 10 of the 35 nonmutated patients were responders (p \u003d 0.042). There was a significant interaction between treatment group and KRAS mutation status for disease control (CR+PR+SD:77.1% vs. 50% vs. 30% vs. 40.9% respectively in four groups, p \u003c 0.05). Of special interest is the finding that 6 out 20 (30%) patients with mutated KRAS experienced long-term disease control to cetuximab-based therapy, the presence of a heterozygous KRAS mutation in the tumor was a mutant peak with a height of 1/3 or 1/4 of that of the wild type. Conclusions: The East China patients share the same mutation frequency and type of KRAS gene with other races. Patients with wild type KRAS mutation have significantly higher response rate and disease control rate on cetuximab plus chemotherapy treatment. Our results once again show that somatic mutations status of KRAS is a major determinant of cetuximab response in mCRC. There was no statistical correlation between acne-like rash of the major toxicities and mutations status of KRAS. In regard to the 1/3-1/4 mutation patients, we should reconsider and given access to treatment. That would need to be validation between Chinese or ethnicity association phenotype by a large numbers of samples.","title":"Practical application of using predictive biomarkers to select patients with metastatic colorectal cancer for treatment with cetuximab.","pubmedId":"ASCO_60628-101"}
