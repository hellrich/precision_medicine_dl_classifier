All patients underwent mastectomy and samples were submitted to AFIP (Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi) for histopathology and determination of estrogen and progesterone receptors and Her-2/neu gene amplification. Moreover, association of Her-2/neu amplification to other characteristics like tumour size, node involvement, histological grade and presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors were also studied.\nOut of 50 patients, 18 (36%) were positive for Her-2/neu overexpression. Among the various prognostic factors, age showed a statistically significant relation to Her-2/neu positivity (p\u003d0.001). The Her-2/neu positive cancers were larger in size (mean size of 7.9 +/- 3.615 and 5.4 +/- 1.906 cm in Her-2/neu positive and negative cases respectively; p\u003d0.002). Her-2/neu positive cases had statistically significant relation to number of involved lymph nodes (mean number of 9.9 and 4.4 lymph nodes in Her-2/neu positive and negative cases respectively; p\u003d0.001). Tumour grade and nuclear grade had no statistically significant relation to Her-2/neu status (p\u003d0.19 and 0.434 respectively). Both estrogen and progesterone receptors are inversely related to Her-2/neu positivity (p\u003d0.028 and 0.006 respectively).\nThe pathological and clinical characteristics of Her-2/neu positive and negative subsets differ, and Her-2/neu overexpression was associated with other poor prognostic factors of age, tumour size and number of nodes involved. There was an inverse relation of Her-2/neu status and hormone receptor.","title":"Her-2/neu gene overexpression in breast carcinoma and its association with clinicopathological characteristics of the disease.","pubmedId":"19409162"}
