Cough and expectoration during the last 6 years. - Exposure: Driver of cereals, massive exposure to mouldy and pest contaminated grains. Gave up his profession in 1979 due to dyspnea with short (2-3 h) latency after exposure. Since 1980 intermittent exposure during occasional jobs; renewed symptomatology. Aspergillus fumigatus detected on agar plates inoculated with material from wet areas in bathroom and kitchen. - Clinical symptoms: Barely audible vesicular breathing, barrel-shaped thorax, inspiratory-intercostal retraction. - Bodyplethysmography: Obstructive pulmonary emphysema with FEV1 0.8 l, TLC 7.8 l, RV/TLC relation 67%. - Precipitin-detection: Significantly increased IgG against Fusarium. Other moulds including Aspergillus: negative; thermophilic actinomycetes: negative; pigeon and chicken: negative; Ouchterlony with native material from patients flat: negative. - CT including HR-CT: Bilateral-substantial emphysema, no bullae, no ground glass-opacity, no signs for interstitial lung diseases, no mediastinal enlargement of lymph nodes. - Alpha-1-Antitrypsin: 1.67 to 2.3 g/l (normal range), phenotype M1. - Histology: In resected material from right-side lung-volume-resection detection of pulmonary emphysema as well as lymphocyte infiltration and numerous epitheloid cell granulomas with Langhans\u0027giant cells without caseation assessed as residues of an exogenous allergic alveolitis. - Conclusion: In a patient with lung volume reduction surgery due to severe emphysema histologically a persistent exogenous allergic alveolitis was detected, which might have caused the emphysema.","title":"Histologically proven extrinsic allergic alveolitis with severe obstructive pulmonary emphysema","pubmedId":"10756171"}
