Around 2007, the highest male rates were in France (6.2/100,000), Spain (4.9), and Italy (4.0), while the lowest ones were in Sweden (1.1), the Netherlands (1.2), and the UK (1.8). In women, mortality was lower (0.8/100,000 in 2007 in the EU), and showed more favourable trends, with a decline of over 2% per year over the last two decades as compared with 0.4% in men, in the EU. In contrast, the EU mortality from ICC increased by around 9% in both sexes from 1990 to 2008, reaching rates of 1.1/100,000 men and 0.75/100,000 women. The highest rates were in UK, Germany, and France (1.2-1.5/100,000 men, 0.8-1.1/100,000 women).\nPLC mortality has become more uniform across Europe over recent years, with an overall decline; in contrast, ICC mortality has substantially increased in most Europe.","title":"A comparison of trends in mortality from primary liver cancer and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Europe.","pubmedId":"23378539"}
