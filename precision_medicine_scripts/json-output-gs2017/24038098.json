Three types of stigmatization were identified: stigmatization by anticipation, stigmatization through rejection, and stigmatization by affiliation. Participants described potential impacts on their womanhood, felt threatened by others, and revealed fears that their children would inherit their stigmatization. These findings indicate the importance of psychological support in the follow-up of such patients. ","title":"Genetic testing: when prediction generates stigmatization.","pubmedId":"24038098"}
