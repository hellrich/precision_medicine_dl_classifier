Despite continuing research, effective treatments continue to be elusive with median survival of only 8-12 months. Treatment options for locally advanced pancreatic cancer include radiation therapy, concurrent chemoradiation or chemotherapy. It is felt that radiation therapy is a suboptimal treatment as most of patients will die of systemic disease. In the past, radiation with 5-FU was the standard treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. But now radiation has been used with combination other chemo agents such as paclitaxel or gemcitabine in order to increase the efficacy. Chemotherapy such as gemcitabine alone or gemcitabine doublet also has been studied in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer as well with overall survival being approximately the same magnitude as chemoradiation. The exact role of chemoradiation or chemotherapy in treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer is yet to be defined. Hence, this review summarizes and compares of role of radiation, chemoradiation and chemotherapy in treating this disease.","title":"Is there an optimal neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer?","pubmedId":"17495356"}
