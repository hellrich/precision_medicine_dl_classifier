Positive TKTL1 and p63 expression significantly correlated with larger tumor size, deeper invasion, higher TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis (P\u003c 0.05). The expression of TKTL1 significantly correlated with p63 expression in gastric cancer tissues (r \u003d 0.476, P \u003c 0.01). Univariate analysis revealed that positive TKTL1 and/or positive p63 expression correlated significantly with shorter survival and lower 5-year survival rate (P \u003d 0.001). Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that expression of TKTL1 and p63 is an independent prognostic factor (P \u003c 0.05) in gastric cancer.\nBoth TKTL1 and p63 are independent prognostic factors of the poor outcome of gastric cancer patients.","title":"TKTL1 and p63 are biomarkers for the poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients.","pubmedId":"26406948"}
