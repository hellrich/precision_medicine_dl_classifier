Data are emerging demonstrating the safety of the laparoscopic approach for distal (left) pancreatectomy, with potential benefits over the standard open approach; however, less information exists as to the effects of laparoscopic resection of cancers of the pancreas. This article reviews and analyzes the existing literature on laparoscopic pancreatectomy for pancreatic malignancies.","title":"Laparoscopic management of pancreatic malignancies.","pubmedId":"20362796"}
