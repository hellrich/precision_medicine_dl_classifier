We explored the combination of the MEK inhibitor trametinib with the AKT inhibitor GSK2141795 in BRAF/NRAS WT and BRAF WT/NRAS mutant (MT) melanoma.  Methods:    Study accrual goal was 24 patients (pts) with metastatic BRAF WT/NRAS WT melanoma and 24 pts with BRAF WT/NRAS MT melanoma. Eligibility criteria included: unresectable stage III or IV disease, ECOG status 0-2, stable CNS disease, and adequate cardiac function (LVEF  50%, QTc \u003e 480). For each cohort, an interim analysis was pre-specified after 10 pts. If no responses were seen, the cohort would be closed. If one or more responses were seen, an additional 14 pts would be accrued. Pts received trametinib (1.5 mg) and GSK 2141795 (50 mg) orally, once daily for each cycle lasting 28 days. ORR was assessed by RECIST 1.1 with restaging performed every 8 weeks (2 cycles).   Results:    Twenty pts were enrolled from October 2013 to October 2014: 10 pts in each NRAS cohort. Rash (70%) and diarrhea (50%) were the most common drug-related adverse events (AEs) for all grades; mucositis occurred in 40% of pts. The best overall response was stable disease in 65%: 80% of BRAF WT/NRAS WT patients and 50% of BRAF WT/NRAS MT patients. No RECIST-confirmed partial or complete responses were observed. As a result, both cohorts were closed to further accrual. Median progression-free survival was 2.75 months (IQR: 1.7 to 3.7 mos), with no difference between the NRAS cohorts (p \u003d 0.46).   Conclusions:    The combination of trametinib and GSK2141795 is safe, but at these doses and schedules, is ineffective in the BRAF WT population, regardless of NRAS status. Clinically significant adverse events were common at the doses tested. Pharmacodynamic studies are ongoing to determine the extent of pathway inhibition achieved.
