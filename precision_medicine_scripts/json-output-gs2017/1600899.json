Among them, 34 women and 11 men had mixed mood disorders with a symptomatology near that of typical depression (major depression, according to the DSM III-R criteria) but not of mixed bipolar disorder. The main symptoms were: dysphoric mood with irritability; internal tension, psychic and sometimes physical agitation; emotional lability; head crowded with thoughouts or thoughts that vanish too quickly; sleep disorders with initial insomnia or with frequent night awakenings; suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide with impulsiveness. These patients sustained severe suffering. They were in no way slow-minded but rather talkative and expressive. Antidepressant drugs increased agitation and insomnia, and in some cases, suicidal impulses. BZDs had limited efficacy but neuroleptics given in small doses, anticonvulsants and lithium gave very effective results. A limited number of electroshocks provided rapid improvement. In many respects, depression with delirium seems a more severe form of the above-described combined depressive syndrome and responds to the same treatments. We think that this mood disorder includes excitement as an important component, although this was not clearly evident. However, it is not easy to conceive this syndrome as a mixture of depressive and manic symptoms; it should rather be regarded as another specific mood condition, either permanent or transient, situated between the two other conditions.","title":"[Mixed depressive syndrome].","pubmedId":"1600899"}
