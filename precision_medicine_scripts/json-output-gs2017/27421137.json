Prior studies reported a MET amplification rate of 9-18% in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) but do not differentiate increased gene copy numbers due to chromosomal level aberrations from focal gene amplifications. Validation of MET amplification rate in mCRC is critical to this field.\nIn tumor tissue-based analyses, overall MET amplification rate was 1.7% (10/590). MET amplification was seen in 0/103 (0%), 4/208 (1.9%) and 6/279 (2.2%) cases, in cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Rate of MET amplification in cfDNA of cohort 4 patients refractory to anti-EGFR therapy (n \u003d 53) was 22.6% (12/53) and was significantly higher compared to patients not exposed to anti-EGFR therapy (p \u003c 0.001).\nWe analyzed MET amplification in mCRC (n \u003d 795) using different methods across multiple cohorts. Cohort 1 (n \u003d 103) and 2 (n \u003d 208) included resected liver metastases and tumor biopsies, respectively, tested for MET amplification using fluorescence in-situ hybridization [amplification: MET/CEP7 ratio ≥ 2.0]. Using another tissue-based approach, cohort 3 (n \u003d 279) included tumor biopsies sequenced with HiSeq (Illumina) with full exome coverage for MET [amplification: ≥ 4 copies identified by an in-house algorithm]. Using a blood-based approach by contrast, cohort 4 (n \u003d 205) included patients in whom the full exome of MET in circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) was sequenced with HiSeq.\nContrary to prior reports, in this large cohort, MET amplification was a rare event in mCRC tissues. In plasma by stark contrast, MET amplification identified by cfDNA occurred in a sizable subset of patients that are refractory to anti-EGFR therapy.","title":"MET amplification in metastatic colorectal cancer: An acquired response to EGFR inhibition, not a de novo phenomenon.","pubmedId":"27421137"}
