Traditionally, their detection is based on direct DNA sequencing and their frequency has been reported to be 8-10% in the Caucasian non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) population with 90% of these being the exon 21 L858R point mutation and exon 19 D746-750 deletion. Here, we assess the frequency of these two mutations with immunohistochemistry in two large NSCLC Caucasian cohorts. Methods: Cohorts were analyzed in a tissue microarray format including 145 cases from Yale Cancer Center and 266 cases from Sotiria General Hospital, Athens, and Patras Hospital, Rion, Greece. D746-750 and L858R mutation specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies) were used and detection was measured with quantitative immunofluorescence (AQUA). Results: The Yale cohort included 71 adenocarcinoma (AC) and 30 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases, 67 females and 78 males. One SCC was a L858R carrier and one large cell carcinoma specimen was found D746-750 positive, yielding a frequency of mutated EGFR of 1.37%. The Greek cohort included 104 AC and 132 SCC cases, 33 females and 218 males, 203 smokers and 21 never-smokers. Three mutations were detected (3/266, 1.12%), 1 D746-750 AC and 2 L858R SCCs. For the majority of cases in both cohorts, the staining pattern was either clearly positive or negative; rare cases with minimal expression above background by quantitative assessment proved negative for mutation by DNA sequencing for the Yale cohort. The positive cases all showed a homogeneous pattern throughout the spot. There were no cases that showed a few positive cells admixed with negative cells. Conclusions: Although these antibodies are estimated to detect only 90% of the mutated forms, the frequencies of EGFR mutations in these NSCLC Caucasian cohorts are much lower than previously reported. This immunohistochemistry-based test is easily applicable and could be valuable for screening large populations for EGFR mutation status.
