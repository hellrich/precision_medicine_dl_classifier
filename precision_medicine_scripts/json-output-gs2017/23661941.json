The EUS-FNA specimen showed small amounts of atypical epithelium with noticeable lymphocytes and plasma cells. A pancreatic resection was performed, and the histopathological features showed an invasive pancreatic ductal carcinoma with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis (LPSP)-like lesions. Most of the plasma cells were immunoreactive to anti-IgG4 antibody. EUS-FNA may be necessary for the differential diagnosis of AIP and pancreatic cancer, and close attention should be given to the presence of marked lymphoplasmacytic cells in EUS-FNA specimens while making the diagnosis.","title":"A case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with marked infiltration with IgG4-positive cells.","pubmedId":"23661941"}
