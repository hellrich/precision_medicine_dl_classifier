Increasing evidence demonstrates stromal cells play pivotal roles in promoting breast cancer progression and metastasis. Breast cancer stroma is comprised mainly of Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs secrete various growth factors and cytokines that promote breast cancer progression and metastasis; one of these factors is SDF-1 (CXCL12), a soluble chemokine that is promotes chemotaxis and motility, and facilitates cancer cell motility and angiogenesis. CAFs also secrete soluble factors that activate ERK 1/2 MAPK signaling in breast cancer cells, which has been shown to promote loss of estrogen receptor (ER) in luminal breast cancer cells. Hyperactivation of MAPK signaling (hMAPK) also associates with aggressive, basal-like and HER2-positive breast cancer and poor prognosis. Recently, we identified a patient-derived hMAPK-microRNA signature indicative of poor clinical outcome that contains microRNAs known to regulate breast cancer associated genes. The vast majority of ER- breast cancers display this microRNA signature, as do a subset of ER+ breast cancers with poorer clinical outcome. We also discovered that the breast cancers that exhibit this microRNA signature display high stromal and immune infiltrate scores, suggesting that breast cancer stroma provides important contributions to this microRNA signature and the poor clinical outcomes associated with it.To study the role of CAFs and CAF-secreted factors in breast cancer progression and metastasis, we established primary breast CAF lines from indolent breast cancers (Luminal A), and from aggressive breast cancers (ER-/HER2 amplified; triple negative). We have demonstrated that these CAFs differentially express several members of the hMAPK-microRNA signature compared to cultured primary breast cancer cells, supporting the contribution of stroma to the signature. Importantly hMAPK-microRNAs secreted from aggressive CAFs can be taken up by breast cancer cells, whereupon they repress their targets. Normal human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) and indolent CAFs do not secrete these microRNAs.We identified a novel class of circulating cells in the blood of breast cancer patients with metastases -CAFs (cCAFs). Patients without metastases did not have these cCAFs - suggesting cCAFs may be aggressive CAFs that facilitate breast cancer metastasis. Patients with overt metastasis and elevated counts of cCAFs have significantly higher levels of circulating SDF-1 in their plasma, as well as differential circulating microRNAs, and specifically hMAPK-microRNAs also found secreted by aggressive CAFs. Our results suggest there is a hierarchy of CAFs whereby aggressive tumors establish aggressive CAFs to facilitate metastasis. We also establish a clear link between circulating CAFs and CAF-secreted factors such as SDF-1 and microRNAs with breast cancer metastasis.","title":"Circulating CAFs and CAF-secreted factors may be indicative of breast cancer metastasis","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4396"}
