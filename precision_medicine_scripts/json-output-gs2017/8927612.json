Ki-ras oncogene point mutations are known to be involved in pancreatic oncogenesis. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and also functions as a nuclear transcription factor. Point mutations in the p53 gene have been observed in a variety of malignancies. We determined the frequency of p53 protein overexpression and p53 point mutations in the conserved and nonconserved domains in pancreatic cancers as well as the coincidence of Ki-ras mutation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Genomic DNA was isolated from 20 frozen pancreatic adenocarcinomas (14 primary, six metastases) along with six specimens of control pancreatic tissue and screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by direct genomic sequencing of SSCP variants. SSCP analysis was accomplished by incorporating 32P-dCTP in 12 separate polymerase chain (PCR) amplifications covering the p53 coding exons 2-11. All mobility shifts on SSCP were subjected to direct genomic sequencing by the modified dideoxy method. Immunoperoxidase (IP) staining was also done with a p53 monoclonal antibody. Ki-ras codon 12 mutational analysis was accomplished by incorporating 32P-dCTP by polymerase chain reaction amplification utilizing mismatched primers, which create a BstN1 restriction endonuclease site spanning codon 12; the products were digested by BstN1. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis allowed distinction between wild-type and mutant Ki-ras. p53 mutations were found in 5 of 20 pancreatic cancers (three of 14 primary tumors, two of six metastatic tumors). Point mutations were observed in three of 14 primary tumors, and one of six metastases, while a 2-base pair duplication resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 5 was found in one metastatic tumor. Point mutations were noted in conserved domains (exons 4, 5, 8) and in the nonconserved domain (exon 10). IP staining revealed that eight of 14 of the primary tumors and two of six metastases exhibited moderate to strong nuclear staining (\u003e 30%), while no nuclear staining was evident in the controls. Ki-ras codon 12 mutations were found in 14 of 20 (70%) pancreatic cancers (nine of 14 primary tumors, five of six metastatic tumors) and none of the six controls. Fifty percent of the primary pancreatic tumors demonstrated moderate to strong nuclear staining. Extensive genetic analysis demonstrated mutations in 30% of the pancreatic cancers. One cancer had a nonsense mutation not detected by IP. Seven of 19 (37%) pancreatic cancers exhibited both Ki-ras point mutation and p53 protein overexpression or mutation. Both genetic analysis and IP are required to characterize all p53 mutations in pancreatic cancer. Ki-ras codon 12 mutations and p53 protein overexpression are important steps in pancreatic oncogenesis.","title":"Ki-ras and p53 mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"8927612"}
