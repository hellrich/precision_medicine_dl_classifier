We have discovered a small, fusion-type tyrosine kinase EML4-ALK that is generated through a tiny inversion within the short arm of human chromosome 2. Transgenic mice expressing EML4-ALK in lung developed hundreds of lung cancer nodules soon after birth, but such nodules were readily eradicated upon treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Clinical trials for EML4-ALK-positive lung cancer with an ALK inhibitor is ongoing, with its interim results being highly promising.","title":"[ALK inhibitor].","pubmedId":"21368458"}
