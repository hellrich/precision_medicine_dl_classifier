However, current risk stratification schemes may still have room for improvement. This study seeks to analyze prognostic factors for primary GISTs from 3 aspects, including clinicopathological parameters, immunohistochemical biomarkers, and gene mutational status, and attempts to find novel valuable factors predicting the malignancy potential of GISTs.\nRetrospective data from 114 primary GIST patients after R0 resection were collected. Clinicopathological data was obtained from medical records and re-evaluated. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using the Tissue Microarray method for Ki67, p16, p27, p53, SKP2, CD133, and actin. KIT gene exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and PDGFRÎ± gene exons 12 and 18 were tested for mutations using PCR.\nUnivariate analysis revealed the following factors as poor prognostic indicators for relapse-free survival with a median follow-up of 50 months: male gender, gastrointestinal bleeding, mitotic index \u003e5/50HPFs, tumor size \u003e5 cm, non-gastric site, necrosis, epithelioid or mixed cell type, surrounding tissue invasion, Ki67\u003e5%, p16\u003e20%, p53 index \u003e10, SKP2\u003e10%, and KIT exon 11 deletion. Besides mitotic index, tumor size and site, SKP2 high expression (RR \u003d 2.91, 95% CI: 1.41-5.99, P \u003d 0.004) and KIT exon 11 deletion (RR \u003d 2.73, 95% CI: 1.04-7.16, P \u003d 0.041) were also independent risk factors in multivariate analysis, with gastrointestinal bleeding also showing a trend towards significance (RR \u003d 1.88, 95% CI: 0.98-3.64, P \u003d 0.059). In addition, gastrointestinal bleeding and SKP2 high expression showed a good ability to stratify high-risk patients further.\nOur results show that gastrointestinal bleeding, SKP2 high expression, and KIT exon 11 deletions may be useful indicators of high recurrence risk for primary GIST patients.","title":"SKP2 high expression, KIT exon 11 deletions, and gastrointestinal bleeding as predictors of poor prognosis in primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"23690967"}
