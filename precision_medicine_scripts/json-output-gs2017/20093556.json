Because abnormal microRNA production is commonly detected in cancer, we investigated noninvasive precursor pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions for microRNA production as a potential early biomarker of PDAC.\nPathologists identified and classified ductal lesions. We extracted total RNA from laser-capture microdissected PanIN tissue samples from a conditional KRAS(G12D) mouse model (n \u003d 29) or of human origin (n \u003d 38) (KRAS is v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog). MicroRNA production was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR. Internal controls included 5S and U6 RNAs.\nProduction of microRNAs miR-21, miR-205, and miR-200 paralleled PanIN progression in the KRAS(G12D) mouse model, compared with microRNA production in samples of nonpathologic ducts. miR-21 demonstrated the highest relative concentrations in the precursor lesions. Interestingly, miR-205 and miR-21 up-regulation preceded phenotypic changes in the ducts. The production of microRNAs miR-21, miR-221, miR-222, and let-7a increased with human PanIN grade, with peak production occurring in hyperplastic PanIN-2/3 lesions. In situ hybridization analysis indicated miR-21 production to be concentrated in pathologic ductal cells. miR-21 production was regulated by KRAS(G12D) and epidermal growth factor receptor in PDAC-derived cell lines.\nAberrant microRNA production is an early event in the development of PanIN. Our findings indicate that miR-21 warrants further investigation as a marker for early detection of PDAC.","title":"MicroRNA-21 is induced early in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma precursor lesions.","pubmedId":"20093556"}
