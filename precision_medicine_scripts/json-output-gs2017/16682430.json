DNA was extracted from these paraffin embedded surgical margins and assessed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction to detect the K-ras gene mutation at codon 12. Detection of K-ras mutation was correlated with standard clinicopathological factors.\nK-ras mutation was detected in histologically negative surgical margins of 37 of 70 (53%) patients. A significant difference in overall survival was demonstrated between patients with margins that were K-ras mutation positive compared with negative (median 15 v 55 months, respectively; p \u003d 0.0008). By univariate and multivariate analyses, detection of K-ras mutation in the margins was a significant prognostic factor for poor survival (hazard ratio (HR) 2.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-5.3), p \u003d 0.0009; and HR 2.8 (95% CI 1.4-5.5), p \u003d 0.004, respectively).\nDetection of cells harbouring K-ras mutation in histologically negative surgical margins of pancreatic cancer may represent unrecognised disease and correlates with poor disease outcome. The study demonstrates that molecular-genetic evaluation of surgical resection margins can improve pathological staging and prognostic evaluation of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","title":"Unfavourable prognosis associated with K-ras gene mutation in pancreatic cancer surgical margins.","pubmedId":"16682430"}
