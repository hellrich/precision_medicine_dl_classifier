Understanding BRCA1/2 genes mutations is important for reducing breast cancer (BC) incidence, accurate risk assessment and counseling. This systematic review of the literature was conducted to addressing BRCA1/2 mutations in Iranian BC patients.\nA search for relevant articles was run on before January 2014 using MedLine, PubMed, Science Iranian Database, Google, and Web sites related to the study topic. The key words included: BC and Iran with Genes, BRCA Genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2; \"Cancer Genes,\" and \"Iran.\"\nThirteen articles retrieved from this search strategy were eligible for this review. The overall BRCA1 mutation rate for Iranian female BC patients was detected 31.8% (377/1183). Although this gene mutation rate for male patients is \u003c0.01%. Eight BRCA1 mutations (c. 4837A \u003e G, c. 3419G \u003e A, c. 3119G \u003e A, c. 2612C \u003e T, c. 3113A \u003e G, c. 2311T \u003e C, c. 4301T \u003e C and c. 4308T \u003e C in BRCA1, and one BRCA2 mutation (c. 6494G \u003e C) were found in multiple case subjects and represent candidate founder mutations.\nAccording to these studies, there is heterogeneity in BRCA mutations in Iranian BC patients.","title":"BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Iranian breast cancer patients: A systematic review.","pubmedId":"26109977"}
