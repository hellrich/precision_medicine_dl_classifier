It is a heterogeneous disease stage encompassing stage IIIa, for which surgery in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy represents a treatment strategy for select patients, and stage IIIb, for which chemoradiation represents the prevailing standard of care. Overcoming unacceptably high rates of intrathoracic tumor failures remains a central obstacle. Current clinical trial efforts focus on targeted therapies, new chemotherapy regimens, dose-escalated radiation therapy, and improvements in radiation therapy treatment delivery.","title":"Combined modality therapy for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"20685581"}
