Here, we have performed whole-exome sequencing in five widely used experimental metastasis models that were independently derived through in vivo selection from heterogeneous human cancer cell lines. In addition to providing an important characterization of these model systems, our study examines the genetic evolution of metastatic phenotypes. We found that in vivo selected highly metastatic cell populations showed little genetic divergence from the corresponding parental population. However, selection of genetic variations that preexisted in parental populations, including the well-established oncogenic mutations KRAS(G13D) and BRAF(G464V), was associated with increased metastatic capability. Conversely, expression of the wild-type BRAF allele in metastatic cells inhibited metastatic outgrowth as well as tumor initiation in mice. Our findings establish that metastatic competence can arise from heterogeneous cancer cell populations without the need for acquisition of additional mutations and that such competence can benefit from further selection of tumor-initiating mutations that seed primary tumorigenesis.","title":"Metastatic Competence Can Emerge with Selection of Preexisting Oncogenic Alleles without a Need of New Mutations.","pubmedId":"26208905"}
