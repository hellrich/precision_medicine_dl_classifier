Up to 37% of DCIS overexpress HER2. Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that directly inhibits HER2 receptor signaling by blocking the receptors kinase activity. This study tested the hypothesis that lapatinib works inhibiting Ras/Raf/MAK and PI3K/AKT signaling in HER2-positive DCIS. Methods: Patients with HER2-positive (FISH rate \u003e2.2) DCIS diagnosed by core needle biopsy with low risk of having a hidden invasive component were eligible. Neoadjuvant lapatinib 1500mg daily was administered for 4 weeks prior to surgical resection. EGFR was analyzed by FISH in the biopsy specimen. Ki67, PTEN, AKT, pAKT and pERK were evaluated by IHQ. PI3KCA mutations were screened at exons 9 and 20 by PCR. Apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL assay. All biological markers were measured before and after lapatinib treatment. Results: Eighteen pts with HER2-positive DCIS have been included to date. Median FISH amplification was 7 (range 2.70-14). Evaluation pre-lapatinib showed that: none of the pts had EGFR amplification; eight pts (44%) had a Ki67 \u003e25%; pAKT was overexpressed (3+) in 4 pts (22%) and pERK in 2 pts (11%); PTEN was deleted in 4 pts (22%). PI3KCA mutations were detected in only 1 pt (6%). After lapatinib treatment, 17 pts were evaluable. We observed a trend for inactivation of the Ras/Raf/MAK signaling pathway in 12 pts (71%) patients and 2 out of these 12 pts with no evidence of residual DCIS.  Interestingly, 5 of these pts had paradoxical activation of PI3K/Akt suggesting a compensatory feed back loop. One out of these 2 pts has PTEN deleted. In addition, 3 pts (33%) showed an increase in the apoptotic index. Conclusions: In our study, four weeks of lapatinib against HER2-positive DCIS resulted mainly in inactivation of Ras/Raf/MAK pathway; however an activation of the PI3K/Akt was seen as the same time in 5 pts suggesting a compensatory effect. This could generate the hypothesis of the benefit of adding a PI3K/Akt inhibitor to lapatinib.","title":"Biologic study of the effects of lapatinib in PI3K/akt- and ras/raf/MAK-signaling pathways in HER2-positive ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS).","pubmedId":"ASCO_80144-102"}
