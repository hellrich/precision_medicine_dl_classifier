Although they may arise anywhere of GI tract, colonic presentation is infrequent. We report 2 new cases of colonic GISTs localized at descending and sigmoid colon. Endoscopic biopsies were diagnostic for GISTs and no distant metastasis were observed. Both cases underwent resective surgery as the only treatment. No recurrence was observed during the follow-up period. In this clinical note we review the diagnosis, management and therapeutical options in colonic GISTs, according to literature. KIT immunoreactivity is the base for diagnosis. Risk of malignancy is based on the primary tumor diameter and the mitotic count. Anatomic localization is not an independent prognostic factor. Surgery is the standard treatment for localized primary disease and imatinib is indicated if metastatic or unresectable GISTs.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the colon.","pubmedId":"20575602"}
