Thus, identification of ALK rearrangements has become a standard diagnostic test in advanced NSCLC patients. Our institution has been a referral center in Spain for ALK determination by Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility and the FISH patterns of the ALK gene and to evaluate the clinical and pathological features of patients with ALK alterations.\nBetween 2010 and 2014, 1092 samples were evaluated for ALK using FISH technique (927 histological samples, 165 cytological samples). Correlation with available clinical-pathological information was assessed.\nALK rearrangement was found in 35 patients (3.2%). Cytological samples (using either direct smears or cell blocks), were more frequently non-assessable than histological samples (69% versus 89%, respectively) (p \u003c 0.001). Within the ALK-rearranged cases the majority were female, non-smokers, and stage IV.\nAlthough assessable in cytological samples, biopsies are preferred when available for ALK evaluation by FISH. The ALK translocation prevalence and the associated clinico-pathological features in Spanish NSCLC patients are similar to those previously reported.","title":"Assessment of ALK status by FISH on 1000 Spanish non-small cell lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"25393795"}
