In embryonic rat brain days 13-21 (E13-E21), an abundant 1.8 kb bFGF mRNA was detected. Expression of 1.8 kb bFGF mRNA was the highest at E17 to E19 and was relatively undetectable 20 days after birth. However, very little mitogenic activity was associated with prenatal brain. On the other hand, multiple bFGF mRNA species of 6.0, 3.7, 2.5, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4 and 1.0 kb were detected in total adult rat brain and a significant amount of mitogenic activity was present. Differential and spatial bFGF mRNA expression was found in different parts of developing rat brain. Embryonic hypothalamus was found to contain the 1.8 kb bFGF mRNA while the 6.0 kb bFGF mRNA transcript was predominant in adult hypothalamus. Adult pituitary and cortex transcribed the lower molecular weight mRNAs but not the 6.0 kb mRNA. Expression of high-affinity bFGF receptor (flg) mRNA was found to be temporally regulated. flg 4.3 kb mRNA expression was high in embryonic rat brain (E13-E19). There appears to be coordinate expression between the 1.8 kb bFGF mRNA and flg. These results suggest that the expression of basic FGF mRNA is complex since it is both temporally and differentially regulated with different species being expressed at different times in development.","title":"Temporal, differential and regional expression of mRNA for basic fibroblast growth factor in the developing and adult rat brain.","pubmedId":"1662747"}
