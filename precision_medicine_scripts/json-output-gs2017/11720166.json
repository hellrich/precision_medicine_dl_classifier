A healthy 51 year-old-female with no history of hypertension presented with sudden onset of consciousness disturbance and right hemiparesis. Computed tomography revealed a hematoma 5.5 cm in diameter surrounded by thick edematous brain in the left temporal lobe and a tumor 3.5 cm in diameter in the pineal region. Bilateral carotid angiography detected occlusion of the Galenic vein and straight sinus. No causative abnormality of hemorrhage was apparent. However, the left basal vein of Rosenthal had disappeared, and anastomotic venous channels could be observed in the medial left temporal lobe, contiguous to the hematoma. Emergency craniotomy failed to detect any abnormality which could cause hemorrhage in the brain parenchyma surrounding the hematoma. Subtotal removal of the tumor, histologically diagnosed as fibrous meningioma, was achieved three months later employing an occipital transtentorial approach. Venous congestion caused by compression due to the tumor was considered to be one of possible causes of the hemorrhage.","title":"Falcotentorial meningioma accompanied by temporal lobe hematoma.","pubmedId":"11720166"}
