Expression of CD40, VEGF, AKT, and PI3K significantly increased with T stage, while S100 expression decreased with T stage. Lymph node metastasis was associated with low or negative S100 expression. PI3K expression increased with clinical stage, while negative S100 expression was associated with higher clinical stages. Multivariate analysis did not indicate significant associations between any of these markers and recurrence or mortality.\nThe correlation between T stage of gastric cancer and the higher expression of CD40, VEGF, AKT, and PI3K, along with lower S100 expression in DC, may provide insights into future targets for more effective immunotherapy for cancer.","title":"Markers CD40, VEGF, AKT, PI3K, and S100 correlate with tumor stage in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"23429328"}
