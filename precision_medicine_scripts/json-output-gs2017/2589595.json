Of the 21 patients who survived pancreaticoduodenectomy, 4 had tumor confined to the ampulla, 7 had tumor extending into the duodenum, and 10 had tumor invasion beyond the duodenum. Nine of these patients had positive lymph nodes and 12 had negative lymph nodes. The patient who had local excision was disease-free at last follow-up 104 months postoperatively. Each of the three bypassed patients died of tumor progression within 15 months. The estimated 5-year survival rate for resected patients was 60 percent and was independently related to lymph node metastases (p \u003d 0.031) and to tumor size (p \u003d 0.039). This experience suggests that long-term survival is possible in patients with lymph node metastases or invasive tumors extending beyond the duodenal wall and that curative pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed with a low operative mortality; therefore, aggressive surgical resection is recommended for all patients with ampullary carcinoma.","title":"Significance of tumor spread in adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.","pubmedId":"2589595"}
