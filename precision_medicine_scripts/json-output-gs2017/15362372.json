Membranous, cytoplasmic, and/or nuclear expression of p-TrkA was seen in 54.6% of primary melanomas and 30% of metastases. Membranous p-TrkA was detected in 21.7% of primary and 14% of metastatic melanomas and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in 28.9% of primary tumors and in 22% of metastases. Significantly fewer metastases than primary tumors expressed nuclear p-TrkA (16% vs 39.5%; P \u003d .006). A significantly higher percentage of nodular than superficial spreading melanomas expressed membranous (40% vs 11%; P \u003c .0001) p-TrkA. Nevi expressed no membranous or cytoplasmic p-TrkA; 63% showed nuclear reactivity. p-TrkA expression varied significantly with thickness of primary tumors (lower expression in thinner lesions: membranous, P \u003d .004; cytoplasmic, P \u003d .001; nuclear, P \u003d .031). An association between ulceration and membranous (P \u003d .054), cytoplasmic (P \u003c .0001), and nuclear (P \u003d .022) p-TrkA expression was found. Membranous p-TrkA significantly predicted decreased overall survival (P \u003d .002). A significant association between membranous p-TrkA and cyclin A (P \u003d .004) and Ki-67 (P \u003c .0001) and between cytoplasmic p-TrkA and cyclin A (P \u003c .0001), Ki-67 (P \u003d .004), and cyclin D3 (P \u003d .027) was found. p-TrkA had no effect on MAPK(ERK1/2) activation. A significant inverse association between cytoplasmic beta-catenin and cytoplasmic p-TrkA levels (P \u003d .006) and between nuclear p-TrkA and cytoplasmic E-cadherin (P \u003d .022) was seen. We present the first evidence of a role for TrkA activation in a subset of melanomas as a predictor of an aggressive phenotype and poor outcome.","title":"Expression of activated TrkA protein in melanocytic tumors: relationship to cell proliferation and clinical outcome.","pubmedId":"15362372"}
