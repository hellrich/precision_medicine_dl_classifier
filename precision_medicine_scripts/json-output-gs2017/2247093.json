Following 2 days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel weighed the evidence and prepared their consensus statement. Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) breast conservation treatment is an appropriate method of primary therapy for the majority of women with Stage I and II breast cancer and is preferable because it provides survival equivalent to total mastectomy and axillary dissection while preserving the breast; (2) the majority of patients with node negative breast cancer are cured by surgery or by surgery and radiation without further therapy; (3) there is clear evidence that the rate of local and distant recurrence is decreased by both adjuvant combination cytotoxic chemotherapy and by adjuvant tamoxifen; (4) the decision to use adjuvant treatment should follow a thorough discussion with the patient regarding the possible risks and toxicities of therapy and its impact on quality of life; (5) and patients with tumors less than or equal to 1 centimeter have an excellent prognosis and do not require adjuvant therapy outside of clinical trials.
