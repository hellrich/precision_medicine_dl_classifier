Inappropriate activation of c-Met can be induced by ligand-independent mechanisms such as gene amplification, specific genetic mutations, and transcriptional upregulation, or by ligand-dependent autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. Indeed, amplification of the c-Met gene, with consequent protein overexpression and constitutive kinase activation, has been reported in a number of human cancers, including gastric, esophageal and non-small-cell lung carcinomas. It has been reported that 10-20% of gastric tumors have increased copy numbers of the MET gene and overexpression of c-Met significantly correlates with poor prognosis in gastric cancer. c-Met antibody LY2875358 treatment reduces proliferation of gastric cancer cell lines with ligand-independent activation of c-Met resulting from gene amplification. The ability of LY2875358 to internalize and deplete cell surface c-Met is implicated in its activity against ligand-independent driven gastric cell lines. Here, we demonstrate that the pre-clinical combination of c-Met antibody LY2875358 with gastric cancer standard-of-care treatment has better efficacy than either treatment alone, both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that LY2875358 in combination with standard-of-care may be a promising treatment for gastric cancer.","title":"c-Met antibody LY2875358 (LA480) has pre-clinical enhanced efficacy with gastric cancer standard-of-care in vitro and in vivo","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2738"}
