Results from 1 ST sample were not interpretable because of PCR inhibitors. Among the 11 remaining patients, 10 had positive ST samples, whereas only 4 had positive SF samples (P \u003c 0.05).\nThese data suggest that detection of chromosomal B burgdorferi DNA may be more efficient in ST than SF.","title":"Detection of Borrelia burgdorferi by DNA amplification in synovial tissue samples from patients with Lyme arthritis.","pubmedId":"8639170"}
