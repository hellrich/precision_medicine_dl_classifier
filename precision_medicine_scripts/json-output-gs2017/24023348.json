We evaluated the influence of blood products use on postoperative recurrence and outcome of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nThe study included 82 patients who underwent elective pancreatic resections for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma without distant metastasis or other malignancies between January 2001 and December 2010. We retrospectively investigated the influence of the use of perioperative blood products including red cell concentrate, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and albumin preparation, and clinical variables regarding disease-free and overall survival.\nIn disease-free survival, serum carcinoembryonic antigen more than 10 ng/ml (p\u003d0.015), serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) more than 200 U/ml (p\u003d0.0032), R1 resection (p\u003d0.005), and FFP transfusion were independent risk factors for cancer recurrence in the Cox proportional regression model, pancreaticoduodenectomy (p\u003d0.057) and advanced tumor stage (p\u003d0.083) tended to associate with poor disease-free survival, but were not statistically significant. In overall survival, male gender (p\u003d0.012), advanced tumor stage (p\u003d0.005), serum CA19-9 more than 200 U/ml (p\u003c0.001), and FFP transfusion (p\u003d0.003) were positively associated with poor overall survival in the Cox proportional regression model.\nFFP transfusion is associated with poor therapeutic outcome after elective pancreatic resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","title":"Negative impact of fresh-frozen plasma transfusion on prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma after pancreatic resection.","pubmedId":"24023348"}
