Palliation with biliary endoprostheses results in median survival times of 4-6 months for advanced bile duct cancer. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a local photochemical tumor treatment consisting of a photosensitizing agent combined with laser irradiation of a distinct wavelength. Tumor ablation with PDT combined with biliary stenting reduces cholestasis and significantly improves median survival time. However, the treatment is not widely available, and the photosensitizers used for PDT cause prolonged photosensitivity. Optimum control of tumor spread along the bile ducts and control of cholestasis and cholangitis will prolong survival in one to two thirds of patients, and renders them suitable for other antitumor therapies.","title":"The role of photodynamic therapy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"21179270"}
