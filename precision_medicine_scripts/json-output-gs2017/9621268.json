The patient\u0027s visual acuity and visual field have remained stable for 2 years following treatment, and the appearance of the tumor has not changed by neuroimaging. We believe that stereotactic radiosurgery is a viable option for treating optic nerve sheath meningioma.","title":"Preservation of residual vision 2 years after stereotactic radiosurgery for a presumed optic nerve sheath meningioma.","pubmedId":"9621268"}
