It usually involves large airways and presents clinically and radiologically with nonspecific features. Because of nonspecific presentation diagnosis is frequently delayed. We report the case of a 29-year-old male patient wherein a clinico-radiological consideration of tuberculosis (TB) led to a prolonged treatment with anti-TB medications without response. Flexible bronchoscopic biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of MEC following that the patient underwent curative surgical resection.
