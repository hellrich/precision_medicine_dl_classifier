MET is an oncogene including exon 14 mutations and gene amplification associated with worse prognosis. We here report the case of a 47-year-old former smoker, woman, with a stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with multiple chemotherapy failure. A MET amplification was identified and the patient consequently received crizotinib. A major response was observed after eight weeks of treatment. MET amplification screening appears to be interesting with some oncogenic-addicted tumor response rate. Those patients should be enrolled in clinical trials dedicated to tumor with MET alteration.","title":"[Interest of crizotinib in a lung cancer patient with de novo amplification of MET].","pubmedId":"27745897"}
