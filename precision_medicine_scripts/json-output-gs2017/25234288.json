These efforts have led to the discovery of novel oncogenic fusion genes such as ROS1 and RET. However, the molecular and clinicopathologic characteristics associated with RET or ROS1 fusion, compared with ALK fusion-positive lung cancer, remain unclear. We accordingly analyzed the clinicopathologic characteristics of RET- and ROS1-fusion-positive lung adenocarcinomas. We further performed immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (FISH) in 15 cases of RET and 9 cases of ROS1 fusion tumors by identified NanoString\u0027s nCounter screening. RET fusion-positive patients were younger in age, never-smokers, and in early T stage; ROS1 fusion-positive patients had a higher number of never-smokers compared with patients with quintuple-negative (EGFR-/KRAS-/ALK-/ROS1-/RET-) lung adenocarcinoma. Histologically, RET and ROS1 fusion tumors share the solid signet-ring cell and mucinous cribriform pattern, as previously mentioned in the histology of ALK fusion tumors. Therefore, it can be presumed that fusion gene-associated lung adenocarcinomas share similar histologic features. In immunohistochemistry, the majority of 15 RET and 9 ROS1 fusion-positive cases showed positivity of more than moderate intensity and cytoplasmic staining for RET and ROS1 proteins, respectively. In FISH, the majority of RET and ROS1 rearrangement showed two signal patterns such as one fusion signal and two separated green and orange signals (1F1G1O) and an isolated 3\u0027 green signal pattern (1F1G). Our study has provided not only characteristics of fusion gene-associated histologic features but also a proposal for a future screening strategy that will enable clinicians to select cases needed to be checked for ROS1 and RET rearrangements based on clinicohistologic features.
