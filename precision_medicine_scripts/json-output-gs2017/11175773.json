Two new studies offer insights as to how the disease may arise and progress. The first describes mapping and cloning of a new candidate gene, ELAC2, whereas the second demonstrates how cooperation between Cdkn1b and Pten contribute to suppression of prostate tumors.","title":"Prostate cancer: simplicity to complexity.","pubmedId":"11175773"}
