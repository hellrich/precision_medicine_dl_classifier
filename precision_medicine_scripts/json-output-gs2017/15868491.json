Colorectal cancer presents as an emergency situation (obstruction, bleeding or perforation) in approximately 25% of cases and with more or less obvious chronic symptoms in the rest of cases. Rectal cancer patients, with a T1 tumour can be offered local excision whereas patients with more advanced cancer must be offered a more radical abdominal procedure. In large bulky tumours (T3 or definitely T4), MRI should guide the choice of preoperative radiotherapy. Three major indications for radiotherapy are reduction of local recurrences in mobile rectal cancer in order to improve survival, down-staging of the tumour in primary irresectable tumours, and downsizing of low-lying tumours in an attempt to perform a sphincter-saving procedure. The surgical strategy is to remove the tumour-bearing bowel segment with, if possible, a locoregional curative procedure, to restorate bowel continuity, and to ensure an optimal quality of life. In most situations, it is possible to achieve local radical resection. In rectal cancer surgery, the main problem is to stick to the embryological planes during the whole procedure. The whole mesorectum is taken out as a packet down to the level of division. This TME procedure dramatically reduced the local recurrence rate to 3%-7%. Surgeon case volume may be an important factor in cancer surgery success. Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer has stimulated a great deal of interest in recent years, but there are concerns regarding this type of surgery. In conclusion, modern surgery for colorectal cancer is a well-defined technique where the anatomical planes have to be identified. Care must be taken to learn all the essential steps. Data from the literature strongly support that the surgeon is the most important factor for an excellent outcome.","title":"Good colorectal cancer surgery.","pubmedId":"15868491"}
