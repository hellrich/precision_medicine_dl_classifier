Group A (53 patients) had PPV with ILM peeling, and group B (59 patients) had PPV without ILM peeling. SD-OCT imaging and fluorescein angiography were performed postoperatively.\nPreoperative visual acuity was 0.04 and final postoperative visual acuity was 0.27 in both groups (23.4 months in group A, 60 months in group B). Postoperative central retinal thickness was 193 μm (group A) and 258.6 μm (group B). Epiretinal membranes were observed less frequently in group A than in group B (24% vs 49%). Repeated surgeries were performed in 38 cases in group A and in 51 cases in group B.\nFewer cases of epiretinal membranes and macular edema are observed postoperatively with ILM peeling. Visual acuity is similar in both groups, but additional surgeries are fewer with ILM peeling.","title":"The role of ILM peeling in vitreous surgery for proliferative diabetic retinopathy complications.","pubmedId":"23676224"}
