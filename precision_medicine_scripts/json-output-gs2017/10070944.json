Polymorphisms in CDKN2A have also been described, but it is not known whether they influence melanoma risk. We investigated the association of CDKN2A mutations and polymorphisms with melanoma risk in a population-based sample of families ascertained through probands with melanoma.\nThe 482 Queensland, Australia, families in our sample were characterized previously as having high, intermediate, or low family risk of CMM. Unrelated individuals (n \u003d 200 families/individuals) drawn from the Australian Twin Registry served as control subjects. For individuals in the high-risk group, the entire CDKN2A gene coding region was screened for mutations by use of the polymerase chain reaction, agarose gel electrophoresis, allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization, and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. The intermediate- and low-risk families and control subjects were analyzed by ASO hybridization for a total of six recurring mutations as well as for polymorphisms at nucleotides (Nts) 442, 500, and 540.\nCDKN2A mutations were found only in the high-risk families (nine [10.3%] of 87). The prevalence of the Nt500G (guanosine) polymorphism increased linearly with increasing familial risk (two-sided P \u003d .02) and was highest in the nine (primarily Celtic) families with CDKN2A mutations. After adjustment for ethnic origin, the relationship between risk group and the frequency of the Nt500G allele was weakened (P \u003d .25); however, there was no relationship between ethnic origin and Nt500-polymorphism frequency among the control subjects.\nCDKN2A mutations are rare in this population (approximately 0.2% of all melanoma cases in Queensland) and appear to be associated with melanoma in only the most affected families. The Nt500G allele appears to be associated with familial risk, but this association probably reflects Celtic ancestry.","title":"CDKN2A variants in a population-based sample of Queensland families with melanoma.","pubmedId":"10070944"}
