Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in the earlier stages has become possible by taking note of early symptoms, mild abdominal pain, back pain, anorexia, diabetes and obstructive jaundice. Presently, measurements of amylase in serum and urine, serum elastase-1, serum CA 19-9 and US are usually used for screening patients with the symptoms. Furthermore, for correct diagnosis, intensive study by US, dynamic CT, ERCP, MRI, cytological examination and CEA of pancreatic juice, endoscopic pancreatoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography are used. The results of surgical treatment for resectable pancreatic cancer are not generally favorable. Extended pancreatic resection (pancreatoduodenectomy, total pancreatectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with en bloc dissection of the lymph nodes has been performed for patients with invasive cancer. However, local recurrence and distant metastasis usually occurred after surgery. It seems difficult to cure pancreatic cancer by surgery alone. To improve the prognosis of resectable pancreatic cancer, multimodality treatment with intraoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy is performed and a better outcome is achieved.","title":"[Selection of methods for diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer].","pubmedId":"1463336"}
