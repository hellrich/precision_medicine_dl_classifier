The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GADS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-Lifetime (GAD-LT), designed for FDS2, assessed current and past anxiety. Data were analysed using analysis of covariance and multiple mediation models, controlling for age, gender, marital status, and diabetes duration.\nL-MDD and L-GAD were independently associated with more severe current depression (both P\u003c0.001) and anxiety (both P\u003c0.001) symptoms. Mediation models revealed that, through increasing the severity of current depressive symptoms, L-MDD was associated with higher HbA1c and body mass index (BMI), greater likelihood of current smoking, and reduced self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (indirect regression path ab, all P\u003c0.001). In combination, L-MDD+L-GAD additionally elevated the risk of higher HbA1c and worse diabetes management, by increasing the severity of current depressive symptoms (indirect regression path ab, all P\u003c0.001).\nLifetime depression and anxiety increase risk of more severe psychological symptoms, hyperglycaemia, and difficulties with health behaviour in type 2 diabetes. Early screening for these disorders at diabetes diagnosis may be warranted to maximize long-term health outcomes.","title":"Lifetime depression and anxiety increase prevalent psychological symptoms and worsen glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: The Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II.","pubmedId":"27865961"}
