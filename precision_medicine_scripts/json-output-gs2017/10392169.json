Due to the axial CT-scans the simulation of the RT-field is often difficult. MRI in its superior ability to demonstrate and characterize soft tissue and its possibilities of multiplanar imaging can be beneficial. As MRI is less available and more expensive the use of MRI in radiotherapy planning is still restricted. With the introduction of open low-field MRI-systems there is now a cost-saving alternative. The aim of this study was the clinical evaluation of the use of a new open low-field MRI in radiotherapy planning of bronchogenic cancer.\nFifteen patients undergoing primary radiotherapy for lung cancer were studied using an open low-field MRI-system (Picker Outlook 0.23 Tesla). Conventional CT-assisted treatment planning was compared to a MRI-assisted procedure. Contours from coronary T1-weighted MRI-sections were superimposed onto the simulator radiograph using a subtrascope (MR-simulation).\nOpen low-field MR-imaging using T1-weighted sequences resulted in excellent delineation of tumor masses from mediastinal fat, the airways and the vascular structures as well as the radial tumor infiltration into the vicinity of the lung (Figures 1a to 1c). This allowed an exact and reproducible transfer of tumor contours onto the simulator radiograph. The MR-simulation led to optimization in the field configuration in 5/15 patients (Figure 2).\nOpen low-field MRI-systems can be very useful in treatment planning. They are less expensive and need less extensive rebuilding compared to high-field MRI-systems. In the radiotherapy planning of bronchogenic carcinoma the MR-simulation is reasonable and clinically practicable. One of the main advantages of open MRI-systems in comparison to CT and standard MRI-systems in radiotherapy planning is that there is a much greater variety of treatment positions.","title":"[MRI simulation of bronchogenic carcinomas using an open low-field MRI].","pubmedId":"10392169"}
