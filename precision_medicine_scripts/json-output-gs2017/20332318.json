NPe6 is a second-generation photosensitizer, and because it has a longer absorption band (664 nm) than Photofrin (630 nm), we hypothesized that NPe6-PDT would exert a strong antitumor effect against cancer lesions \u003e1.0 cm in diameter, which are assumed to involve extracartilaginous invasion and to be unsuitable for treatment with Photofrin-PDT.\nBetween June 2004 and December 2008, 75 patients (91 lesions) with CLELC underwent NPe6-PDT after the extent of their tumors had been assessed by fluorescence bronchoscopy for photodynamic diagnosis and tumor depth had been assessed by optical coherence tomography.\nSeventy cancer lesions \u003c or \u003d1.0 cm in diameter and 21 lesions \u003e1.0 cm in diameter were identified, and the complete response rate was 94.0% (66 of 70) and 90.4% (19 of 21), respectively. After the mass of large tumors and deeply invasive tumors had been reduced by electrocautery, NPe6-PDT was capable of destroying the residual cancer lesions.\nNPe6-PDT has a strong antitumor effect against CLELCs \u003e1.0 cm in diameter that have invaded beyond the bronchial cartilage, thereby enabling the destruction of residual cancer lesions after mass reduction of large nodular- or polypoid-type lung cancers by electrocautery. The PDT guidelines for lung cancers should therefore be revised because use of NPe6-PDT will enable expansion of the clinical indications for PDT.","title":"Outcome of photodynamic therapy using NPe6 for bronchogenic carcinomas in central airways \u003e1.0 cm in diameter.","pubmedId":"20332318"}
