Two genes underlying this disease have so far been identified: the KAL-1 gene, which encodes anosmin-1, an extracellular matrix protein that promotes axonal guidance and branch formation in vitro; and KAL-2, which encodes the known FGFR1. The implication of FGFR1 and anosmin-1 in the same developmental disease led us to test whether anosmin-1 and FGFR1 interact during the development of the olfactory system. In this paper, we showed that the two proteins co-localise in the olfactory bulb during development in rat. Using cross-immunoprecipitation assays of olfactory bulb extracts, we also demonstrated that anosmin-1 and FGFR1 are comprised within the same protein complex. Moreover, we show that anosmin-1 expression in CHO transfected cells increases FGFR1 accumulation, suggesting that anosmin-1 may act as a positive extracellular regulator of FGFR1 signalling. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that anosmin-1 is an essential component of a FGFR1 pathway that plays a key role during olfactory bulb morphogenesis.","title":"FGFR1 and anosmin-1 underlying genetically distinct forms of Kallmann syndrome are co-expressed and interact in olfactory bulbs.","pubmedId":"17186267"}
