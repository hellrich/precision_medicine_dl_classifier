As a major tumor suppressor, PTEN function must be tightly regulated. Both phosphorylation and membrane association have been reported to regulate PTEN activity. In addition, the COOH terminus of PTEN has a typical PDZ domain-binding motif that interacts with several PDZ domain-containing proteins. In this report, we show that PTEN is acetylated on Lys(402), which is in the COOH-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif. We show that CBP plays a major role in PTEN acetylation, whereas the SIRT1 deacetylase is mainly responsible for PTEN deacetylation. Interestingly, Lys(402) acetylation modulates PTEN interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins, indicating a potential role of acetylation in regulating PTEN function.","title":"PTEN acetylation modulates its interaction with PDZ domain.","pubmedId":"18757404"}
