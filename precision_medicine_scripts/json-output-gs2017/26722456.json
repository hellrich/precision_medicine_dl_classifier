PPAR-γ and PTEN detection was conducted using immunohistochemistry staining. The association of PPAR-γ and PTEN with the clinical parameters and prognosis of RCC was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox\u0027s proportional hazards regression model were used for exploring the relation between variables and prognosis.\nAmong normal renal tissues, para-carcinoma tissues and renal cell carcinomas, positive PPAR-γ expression presented with a progressive tendency (P \u003c 0.001), while positive PTEN expression a degressive tendency (P \u003c 0.001). PPAR-γ expressions were closely related to tumor size, clinical stage and lymph node metastases (all P \u003c 0.05). PTEN expressions were in close association with tumor size, Fuhrman grading, lymph node metastases (all P \u003c 0.05). PPAR-γ expressions were in a negative relation with PTEN expressions (r \u003d -0.417, P \u003c 0.001). Negative PPAR-γ expressions confer a significantly higher overall survival rate than positive PPAR-γ expressions (P \u003d 0.015), while negative PTEN expressions confer a significantly lower overall survival rate than positive PTEN expressions (P \u003d 0.003). Clinical staging, Fuhrman grading, lymph node metastases, PPAR-γ and PTEN were independent prognostic factors for prognosis (all P \u003c 0.05).\nPPAR-γ and PTEN expressions are related to the clinical parameters and prognosis of RCC and may be a biomarker for prognosis of RCC.","title":"Prognostic role of PPAR-γ and PTEN in the renal cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26722456"}
