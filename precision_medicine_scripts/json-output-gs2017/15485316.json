Over the past 30 years, interferon-alpha has been the only agent approved for adjuvant therapy of melanoma. This review summarizes the rationale for adjuvant therapy, and discusses the roles of interferon, immunotherapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the adjuvant setting. New approaches and novel combinations that appear promising for the adjuvant therapy of malignant melanoma are also outlined.","title":"Adjuvant therapy for malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"15485316"}
