Concurrently, gene therapy techniques have been developed that allow targeting or replacement of dysfunctional genes in cancer cells, such as activated tumor-promoting oncogenes, inactivated tumor-suppressing, or apoptosis-promoting genes. This article will review the therapeutic implications of molecular changes associated with non-small cell lung cancer and the status of gene therapy.","title":"Gene therapy for lung cancer.","pubmedId":"16253824"}
