The tumor was diagnosed as papillary meningioma arising from the left falcotentorium with such pathologic characteristics of bronchoalveolar adenocarcinoma. At postoperative day 40, he developed generalized tonic clonic seizure and then progressed to a status epilepticus pattern. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed irregular leptomeningeal enhancement with a significant peritumoral area. Through a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study, we identified the meningioma cells of the papillary type from the CSF. At the postoperative day 60, he fell into semicomatose state, and the computed tomography imaging showed low density on both cerebral hemispheres, except the basal ganglia and cerebellum, with overall brain swelling and an increased intracranial pressure. He died on the following day. We experienced a rare case of a papillary meningioma with leptomeningeal seeding.","title":"Papillary meningioma with leptomeningeal seeding.","pubmedId":"21519503"}
