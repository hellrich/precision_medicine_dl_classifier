However, it is still unclear how this protein is activated in response to this carcinogenic agent. We have shown here that UVC upregulates p16(INK4A) and the phosphorylated form of the protein at the 4 serine sites; Ser-7, Ser-8, Ser-140, and Ser-152. This accumulation of p16(INK4A) occurred through increasing the stability of both forms of the protein. Importantly, phospho-p16(INK4A) showed much higher stability, and UV treatment strongly increased its level in absence of de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, we have shown that the UV-dependent upregulation of both forms of p16(INK4A) is under the control of the protein kinase Atr, which suppresses their UVC-dependent proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, although this degradation is ubiquitin-related for p16(INK4A) through the Skp2 ubiquitin ligase protein, it is ubiquitin-independent for the phosphorylated form. In addition, we present clear evidence that Skp2 is upregulated in ATR-deficient cells, leading to the downregulation of the p27(Kip1) protein in response to UVC light. Moreover, we have shown a preferential association of endogeneous phospho-p16(INK4A) with Cdk4. This association increased following UV-treatment mainly for p16(INK4A) phosphorylated at Ser-140 and Ser-152. Besides, we have shown that Atr regulates UV-related p16/Cdk4-dependent and -independent phosphorylation of pRB and G1 cell cycle delay. Together, these results indicate that p16(INK4A) and p27(Kip1) are key targets in the Atr-dependent signaling pathway in response to UV damage.","title":"The atr protein kinase controls UV-dependent upregulation of p16INK4A through inhibition of Skp2-related polyubiquitination/degradation.","pubmedId":"21270107"}
