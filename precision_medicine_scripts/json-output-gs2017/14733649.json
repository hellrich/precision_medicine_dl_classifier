{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Gene therapy is emerging as a promising modality for the treatment of lung cancer. Diverse strategies employing gene therapy for lung cancer have been investigated in vitro and in animal models, and a number of these approaches have met with promising results. Several phase I and II clinical trials have been undertaken, and early results suggest that it may be safe to administer gene therapy to lung cancer patients. It remains to be determined whether this modality will be efficacious as primary or adjunctive therapy in the setting of lung cancer.","title":"Gene therapy for lung cancer.","pubmedId":"14733649"}
