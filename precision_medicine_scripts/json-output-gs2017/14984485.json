Based on the latest results from this trial and on previous investigations of other AIs, a proposed sequence of hormonal therapies (including anastrozole, tamoxifen, letrozole, fulvestrant, and megestrol acetate) for the treatment of breast cancer is beginning to emerge for various patient populations.","title":"Hormonal therapy in early and advanced breast cancer.","pubmedId":"14984485"}
