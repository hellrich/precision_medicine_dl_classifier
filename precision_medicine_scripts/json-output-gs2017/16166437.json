GISTs with low mRNA expression of the CDKN2A transcripts p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) but high mRNA expression of CDK4, RB1, MDM2, TP53, and E2F1 were associated with aggressive clinical behavior and unfavorable prognosis, whereas GISTs with a low mRNA expression of CDK4, RB1, MDM2, TP53, and E2F1 were not. GISTs with a moderate to high mRNA expression of all examined genes also seemed to be associated with unfavorable prognosis. Regarding mutation analysis, we found significant differences in the KIT/PDGFRA genotype among the three clusters. Univariate analysis revealed high expression of E2F1 to be associated with mitotic count, proliferation rate, KIT mutation, and aggressive clinical behavior. These findings on mRNA level could be confirmed by immunohistochemistry.\nOur findings implicate differential regulation schemes of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor pathway converging to up-regulation of E2F1 as the critical link to increased cell proliferation and adverse prognosis of GISTs.","title":"Prognostic role of E2F1 and members of the CDKN2A network in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"16166437"}
