This goal was achieved by employing structure-based drug design and traditional optimization strategies, based on WZ4002 and CO1686. These derivatives inhibited the enzymatic activity of EGFR(L858R/T790M) mutants with IC50 values in subnanomolar ranges, while exhibiting hundreds of fold less potency on EGFR(WT). These compounds also strongly inhibited the proliferation of H1975 non-small cell lung cancer cells bearing EGFR(L858R/T790M), while being significantly less toxic to A431 human epithelial carcinoma cells with overexpressed EGFR(WT). The EGFR kinase inhibitory and antiproliferative activities were further validated by Western blot analysis for activation of EGFR and the downstream signaling in cancer cells.
