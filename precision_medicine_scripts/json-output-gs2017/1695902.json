This indicates agonist-induced activation of phospholipase C and hydrolysis of the inositol phospholipids. Pretreatment of the HEL cells with iloprost, a prostacyclin analog that increases cellular cyclic AMP levels, dramatically reduced the formation of inositol phosphates and the increase of [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The inhibitory effects of iloprost were associated with the phosphorylation of a 24-kDa protein, which was detected with an antiserum obtained against the rap 1 protein. The catalytic subunit of protein kinase A inhibited formation of polyphosphoinositides during phosphorylation of the rap 1 protein in membranes. This rap 1 protein might have functional relevance in the inhibition of agonist-induced inositide metabolism.","title":"Effect of protein kinase A on inositide metabolism and rap 1 G-protein in human erythroleukemia cells.","pubmedId":"1695902"}
