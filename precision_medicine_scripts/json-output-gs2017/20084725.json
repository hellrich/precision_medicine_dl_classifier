The induction chemotherapy consists of cisplatin (80 mg/m2) day 1 and Gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2), infusion day 1 and 8. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. Radiotherapy was given 4-6 weeks after chemotherapy to a dose of 60 Gy/30 fractions/6 weeks.\nA total of 66 patients were evaluable for response; 34 in group A and 32 in group B. The overall response rate was 41.2% for group A and 21.8% for group B (P \u003c 0.5) but with no complete response observed in either group. At a median follow up of 15 months, the overall survival was 65% and median survival was 12 months for group A. However in group B the overall survival at 15 months was 30% and the median survival was 9 nt (P \u003c 0.001). Treatment toxicity in group A was mainly haemotological in 79% of patients none of them was grade II or IV. Grade Nausea and vomiting was reported in 73.5% of patients, grade I esophagitis in 5.8% of patients, grade I, radiation pneumonitis in 26.4% of patients. Alopecia was observed in 29.4% of patients, nephrotoxicity in 17.4%. Treatment toxicity in group B were generally less than in group A but not statistically significant except fr grade III vomiting (15.6%) and alopecia (0%).\nCombination chemotherapy of cisplatin and gemcitabine is a tolerable and active induction chemotherapy regimen for patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Sequential radiotherapy given after induction chemotherapy is tolerable and offers a hope of improved locoregional control and survival compared with radiotherapy alone.","title":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"20084725"}
