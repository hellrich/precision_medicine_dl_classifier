{"organisms":["9103"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"We present our data comparing retrospectively the efficacy of abiraterone and cabazitaxel in patients who progress after docetaxel treatment.\nThe study included 56 patients diagnosed with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer who were previously treated with abiraterone therapy at four oncology centers in Turkey.\nWith abiraterone, the patients had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.9 months (95% confidence interval (CI) for hazard ratio (HR) (4.4-7.4)) and an overall survival of 13.4 months (95% CI for HR (5.5-21.3)). When we compared the disease-free survival (DFS) of reference patients treated with cabazitaxel as a second-line treatment with those receiving second-line abiraterone therapy, there was no significant difference. (PFS \u003d 5.9 months with cabazitaxel vs. 6.7 months with abiraterone, P \u003d 0.213).\nThis study has shown that in our experience abiraterone acetate is an effective agent in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) regardless of the line of treatment.","title":"Line of abiraterone acetate in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer--Does it matter? report of a multi-institutional experience.","pubmedId":"26960509"}
