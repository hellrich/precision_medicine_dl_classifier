This study aimed to evaluate the possible prognostic role of serum ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA expressions in lung adenocarcinoma patients. One hundred newly diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma patients and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Expression was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR and overall survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Serum ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA expressions was found to be significantly associated with distant metastases and TNM stages. It was observed that patients with distant metastases had 4.8- and 3.4-fold high ERBB3 and ERBB4 expression in contrast to patients without distant metastases, respectively. It was also found that ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA expression was 7.7-fold and 6.7-fold high in TNM stage IV compared to TNM stage I, respectively. Significantly, 2.6-fold increased serum ERBB4 mRNA expression was found in patients with pleural effusion compared to patients without pleural effusion (p \u003d 0.005). Lung adenocarcinoma patients with ≤8- and \u003e8-fold increased serum ERBB3 mRNA expression had 10.0 and 5.5 months of overall median survival while serum ERBB4 mRNA with ≤10- and \u003e10-fold increased expression showed 11.4 and 5.0 months overall median survival, respectively. ERBB3 and ERBB4 together also found to be significantly associated with poor overall median survival. Patients with ≤8 + ≤10- and \u003e8 + \u003e10-fold expression showed 11.3 vs 4.8 months of overall median survival, respectively. In conclusion, serum ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA expressions may be a prognostic marker and monitoring of serum ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA can be one of the predictive factors for metastases and poor overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients.
