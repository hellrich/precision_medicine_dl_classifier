Laparoscopic surgical staging is emerging as a valid approach, compared to clinical and imaging staging, to better identify the treatment plan. Minimally invasive surgery plays the greatest role in the treatment of early cervical carcinoma (ECC). Laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy (LARVH) is an alternative surgical strategy in this subset of patients. Interest has been increasing in using conservative fertility-sparing surgery such as laparoscopic vaginal radical trachelectomy (LVRT) or chemo-conization, options to be preferred in selected patients, with early-stage disease and asking for future fertility. Chemoradiotherapy currently represents the gold standard in the treatment of patient with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). In Italy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by radical surgery is today emerging as a valid alternative to the standard chemoradiation and the paclitaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin (TIP) regimen is one of the most active neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic treatments. Moreover, the combination of different strategies to maximize local control should be considered. Among different approaches to this issue the use of a three-modality treatment, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery has been investigated. Our data on a large single-institutional series of LACC patients treated with chemoradiation followed by radical surgery confirm that this three-modality treatment can achieve overall survival (OS) and Disease Free Survival (DFS) rates at least comparable to chemoradiation alone, with an acceptable rate of complications. Tailoring of radical surgery, on the basis of intraoperative findings, such as lympho-nodes status, might play an important role in diminishing the overall rate of complications and eventually improve quality of life (QoL) of these patients. Cervical cancer generally has an aggressive impact on relatively young women and, as we experienced, the relevance of psychosocial aspects in gynaecologic oncology has become a main issue.","title":"Treatment of cervical cancer in Italy: strategies and their impact on the women.","pubmedId":"19480960"}
