Using Envision detection system, paraffin-embedded sections of the resected cholangiocarcinoma tissue were stained with antibodies against CD34 and c-kit, respectively. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, and the results were examined under light microscope. Normal tonsil and mammary tissues were used as positive controls for CD34 and c-kit, respectively.\nCD34 was positive in all sections, but only in capillary endothelial cells of tumor tissue. No cholangiocarcinoma cells were positive for CD34. In one case of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a few tumor cells (about 5%) were immunoreactive with c-kit.\nCD34 or c-kit positive cells in liver tissue may represent liver stem cells, as they can differentiate into mature biliary cells in vitro. The expression of c-kit by some cholangiocarcinoma cells suggests that cholangiocarcinoma might originate from liver stem cells. However, other mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis, such as de-differentiation of mature cholangiocytes, may also exist.","title":"Possible stem cell origin of human cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"15484322"}
