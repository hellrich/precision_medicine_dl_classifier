Sixty-six prospectively collected CMN patients were analyzed for NRAS Q61 mutations using Sanger sequencing. Negative cases were evaluated for BRAF V600E mutation. NRAS Q61 mutations affected 51 patients (77.3%), and BRAF V600E was found in 5 (7.6%). NRAS Q61 mutation affected 29 (80.6%) of 36 giant, 16 (80.0%) of 20 large, and 5 (62.5%) of 8 medium-size CMN; BRAF mutation affected 1 (5%) of 20 large and 4 (11.4%) of 36 giant CMN. Compared to NRAS, BRAF-mutated nevi show scattered/extensive dermal and subcutaneous nodules (100% BRAF+ vs 34.8% NRAS+) (P\u003d0.002). Neurocutaneous melanocytosis (NCM) affected 16 (24.2%) of 66 patients, with NRAS Q61 mutation in 12 (75.0%), and BRAF V600E in 2 (12.5%), P\u003d0.009. Two patients were negative for both mutations (12.5%). In conclusion, although NRAS Q61 mutations predominate, BRAF V600E mutation also affects patients with large/giant CMN (L/GCMN), and with NCM, a novel finding. BRAF V600E is also associated with increased dermal/subcutaneous nodules. These findings open the possibility of BRAF-targeted therapy in some L/GCMN and NCM cases.","title":"BRAF mutations are also associated with neurocutaneous melanocytosis and large/giant congenital melanocytic nevi.","pubmedId":"25490715"}
