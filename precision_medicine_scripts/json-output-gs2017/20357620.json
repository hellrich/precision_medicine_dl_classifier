Four of 31 (13%) cases were discordant (K \u003d 0.736; p \u003c 0.001).\nOur data support the feasibility and reliability of epidermal growth factor receptor gene assessment by FISH on cytology.","title":"Is cytology reliable for epidermal growth factor receptor gene evaluation in non-small cell lung cancer?","pubmedId":"20357620"}
