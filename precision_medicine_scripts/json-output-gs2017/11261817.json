On immunohistochemical study, the neoplastic cells reacted with antibodies against cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and ACTH. Clinicopathologic findings of this rare case of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome are discussed with a literature review.","title":"Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the thymus complicated by Cushing\u0027s syndrome.
