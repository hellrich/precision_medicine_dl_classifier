Average annual percentage of change and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed for trend using linear models assuming a Poisson distribution. The Serbian female population showed an increase in breast cancer mortality continuously from 1991 to 2010 (average annual percentage of change \u003d + 0.9, 95% CI \u003d 0.6-1.1). Breast cancer mortality declined in women aged 30-49 years but increased in women â‰¥50 years old. Decline in breast cancer mortality in young women was observed during the entire period and was significant in those 35-49 years old. In women 50-54 years old, a significant increase in breast cancer mortality during the period 1991-1997 was followed by significant decrease until 2010. In all older age groups, mortality rates significantly increased during all periods observed. The only exception was among women aged 65-69 years old in whom a small, non-significant decrease in breast cancer mortality was observed in the period 1991-1998, followed by significant increase until 2010. According to a comparability test, breast cancer mortality trends in 30-49, 50-69, and 70+ year age groups differed significantly (p \u003c 0.01).
