These approaches include advances in breast irradiation and hormonal and systemic adjuvant therapies. In addition to the identification of new drug targets and targeted therapeutics (eg, trastuzumab), there is renewed re-emphasis in the development of biomarkers for the prediction of response to therapy. One example is the pharmacogenetics of tamoxifen metabolism and the individualization of hormonal therapy. The current treatment of breast cancer continues to evolve rapidly, with new scientific and clinical achievements constantly changing the standard of care and leading to substantial reductions in breast cancer mortality. The goal of this article is to provide clinicians who care for women with breast cancer a multidisciplinary, state-of-the art approach to the treatment of these patients.","title":"A multidisciplinary approach to the management of breast cancer, part 2: therapeutic considerations.","pubmedId":"17803883"}
