Routine HE staining was done for comparison. The results were processed by Chi-square tests in SPSS 10.0 soft ware.\nFifteen of the 32 patients (46.9%) were found to have micro-metastasis in 21 of 181 mLN (11.6%) examined by immunohistochemical staining though routine histopathological examinations were negative. Of those 15 cases, micro-metastasis was detected in 9 only by IHC and in 6 both by IHC and HE stainings. The positive rate of micro-metastasis in N0, N1, and N2 stratified by routine pathology was 36.8% (7/19), 33.3% (2/6) and 85.7% (6/7), respectively (N0 vs N2, P \u003c 0.05). When stratified according to clinical staging (cTNM), pathological staging (pTNM) and pathological staging on the basis of IHC (iTNM), the frequencies of N2 cases were 0, 18.8% and 46.9%, respectively (differences among the three groups: P \u003c 0.01). Nine cases reported as N0(7) and N1(2) by routine histopathological examination were found to have micro-metastasis in mLN by IHC staining, therefore they were actually N2 cases.\nIHC staining with a monoclonal antibody specific for epithelial cells (Ber-Ep4) is more sensitive in the detection of mediastinal micro-metastais than routine HE staining. Underestimation of the extent of mLN metastasis by cTNM and/or pTNM stagings frequently exists in patients with clinically early lung cancer.","title":"[Mediastinal lymph nodes micro-metastases in patients with clinical stage I-II lung cancer].","pubmedId":"15946566"}
