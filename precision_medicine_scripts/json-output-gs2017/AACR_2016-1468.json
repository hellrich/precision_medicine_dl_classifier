High numbers of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes has been showed to be a predictor of favorable clinical outcome in several solid cancers. The role of B cells in tumor microenvironment is still unclear. Recent studies have reported a correlation between the densities of B cells and the favorable clinical outcome of cancer patients. Moreover, some studies considered the organization of tumor infiltrating B cells as criteria in addition to the cell density. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are defined as transient ectopic lymphoid organizations that can develop in non-lymphoid tissues at the site of chronic inflammation, and are anatomically and functionally similar to secondary lymphoid organs. In the present study, we investigated the association between tumor infiltrating B cells and clinicopathological features in gastric cancer.Materials and Methods: Tumor blocks were obtained from 226 patients with stage Ib to stage IV gastric cancer who had undergone initial surgical resection. The density of CD20+ B cells within the tumor and invasive margin area was assessed by immunohistochemistry. We also evaluated CD3+ T cells, CD21+ follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), Bcl6 germinal center B cells, and PNAd+ high endothelial venules (HEVs) to show the presence of TLSs in gastric cancer.Results: Tumor infiltrating B cells mostly organized clusters surrounded by CD3+ T cells. B cell area contained FDCs and some clusters had Bcl6+ B cells. There were HEVs around follicles. We observed most of TLSs at the tumor invasive margin. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that high number of CD20+ B cells was associated with significantly better survival (P\u003c0.0001). Univariate analysis demonstrated a correlation between CD20 high and longer OS, and multivariate analysis also showed that CD20 high was one of the independent predictors of OS.Conclusion: We demonstrated that B cells mostly infiltrated as TLSs and were associated with better prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. Our results suggested that B cells, perhaps as the structure of TLSs, might play an important role for immune response against gastric cancer.","title":"Intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures are associated with favorable prognosis of patients with gastric cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1468"}
