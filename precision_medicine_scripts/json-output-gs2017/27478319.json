This study was to investigate the survival difference between first-line first generation EGFR-TKIs and chemotherapy in patients with either Del19 or L858R, and to directly compare OS in these two mutation groups.\nEligibles were all prospective and retrospective studies comparing EGFR-TKIs with conventional chemotherapy or receiving single agent EGFR-TKIs and demonstrating survival analysis based on mutation types. The primary outcome was OS measured as pooled hazard ratios (HRs). All measures were pooled using randomeffects models and 95% confidential interval (95% CI) was calculated.\nA total of 14 studies incorporating 1,706 patients with either Del19 or L858R were included. Enrolling patients with Del19 or L858R in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), first-line first generation EGFR-TKIs were associated with no OS benefit, compared with chemotherapy (pooled HRTKI/Chemo for Del19: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.64-1.06, P \u003d 0.14; pooled HRTKI/Chemo for L858R: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.85-1.56, P \u003d 0.38). Direct comparison of Del19 with L858R receiving with first-line first generation EGFR-TKIs demonstrated no significant survival difference (pooled HR19/21: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.67-1.16, P \u003d 0.37).\nAmong patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring Del19 and L858R, first-line first generation EGFR-TKIs demonstrated no survival benefit comparing with chemotherapy. Direct comparison between Del19 and L858R revealed no significant survival difference after first-line first generation EGFR-TKIs.","title":"Comparing overall survival between first generation EGFR-TKIs and chemotherapy in lung cancer patients with Del19/L858R.","pubmedId":"27478319"}
