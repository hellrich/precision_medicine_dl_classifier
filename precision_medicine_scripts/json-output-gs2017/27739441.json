We analyzed 47 resected non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas. Histologically, 78% were tubular-type adenocarcinomas mostly gastro-pancreatobiliary type and only 19% pure intestinal. Immunohistochemistry (n\u003d38) revealed commonness of \u0027gastro-pancreatobiliary markers\u0027 (CK7 55, MUC1 50, MUC5AC 50, and MUC6 34%), whereas \u0027intestinal markers\u0027 were relatively less common (MUC2 36, CK20 42, and CDX2 44%). Squamous and mucinous differentiation were rare (in five each); previously, unrecognized adenocarcinoma patterns were noted (three microcystic/vacuolated, two cribriform, one of comedo-like, oncocytic papillary, and goblet-cell-carcinoid-like). An adenoma component common in ampullary-duodenal cancers was noted in only about a third. Most had plaque-like or ulcerating growth. Mismatch repair protein alterations were detected in 13% (all with plaque-like growth and pushing-border infiltration). When compared with ampullary (n\u003d355) and pancreatic ductal (n\u003d227) carcinomas, non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas had intermediary pathologic features with mean invasive size of 2.9â€‰cm (vs 1.9, and 3.3) and 59% nodal metastasis (vs 45, and 77%). Its survival (3-, 5-year rates of 57 and 57%) was similar to that of ampullary-duodenal carcinomas (59 and 52%; P\u003d0.78), but was significantly better than the ampullary ductal (41 and 29%, P\u003c0.001) and pancreatic (28 and 18%, P\u003c0.001) carcinomas. In conclusion, non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas are more histologically heterogeneous than previously appreciated. Their morphologic versatility (commonly showing gastro-pancreatobiliary lineage and hitherto unrecognized patterns), frequent plaque-like growth minus an adenoma component, and frequent expression of gastro-pancreatobiliary markers suggest that many non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas may arise from Brunner glands or gastric metaplasia or heterotopic pancreatobiliary epithelium. The clinical behavior of non-ampullary-duodenal carcinoma is closer to that of ampullary-duodenal subset of ampullary carcinomas, but is significantly better than that of ampullary ductal and pancreatic cancers. The frequency of mismatch repair protein alterations suggest that routine testing should be considered, especially in the non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas with plaque-like growth and pushing-border infiltration.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 14 October 2016; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.174.","title":"Non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas: clinicopathologic analysis of 47 cases and comparison with ampullary and pancreatic adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"27739441"}
