Five years later, the tumor relapsed (stage IV disease) and she initiated chemotherapy with carboplatin, gemcitabine and bevacizumab as a first-line therapy. Despite partial remission after four cycles, this regimen was discontinued due to unacceptable toxicity. In 2008, the disease progressed and the patient was started on Erlotinib as second-line treatment. The patient had a sustained partial remission which she maintains at present - 52 months after initiation of Erlotinib. Molecular testing performed on the primary lung tumor revealed an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene mutation (deletion in exon 19).
