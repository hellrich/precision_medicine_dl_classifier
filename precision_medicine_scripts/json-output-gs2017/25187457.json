Neu, Cre and PTEN genes were amplified by PCR for genotyping of the offsprings. ErbB2/Neu and PTEN expression in mammary tumors were detected by immunohistochemistry. Tumor formation time, tumor number, histopathology and lung metastasis were compared between two models, Ki-67 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL staining of tumor tissues was performed.\nTwo genetically engineered mouse models of ErbB2/Neu positive-PTEN homozygous deficient breast cancer were generated. The models were confirmed by genotyping and immunohistochemistry. One model with exogenous MMTV promoter driven expression of activated ErbB2/Neu and Cre coupling PTEN disruption was designated as NIC/PTEN(-/-) mice, and the other with MMTV-Cre induced endogenous promoter driven expression of activated ErbB2/Neu with PTEN disruption was designated as ErbB2KI/PTEN(-/-) mice. The tumor formation time in NIC/PTEN(-/-) mice was significantly shorter than that of ErbB2KI/PTEN(-/-) mice (30 vs 368 d, P\u003c0.01); the number of tumor and incidence of lung metastasis was also significantly higher in NIC/PTEN(-/-) mice (10 vs 1-2 and 75.0% vs 37.5%, respectively, Ps\u003c0.01). The Two models displayed distinct histopathological morphology. NIC/PTEN(-/-) tumor showed more Ki-67 positive cells than ErbB2KI/PTEN(-/-) tumor did (86.9%±2.8% vs 37.4%±7.2%, P\u003c0.01), while the amount of cell apoptosis in tumors was not significantly different between two models.\nTwo genetically engineered mouse models of ErbB2/Neu positive-PTEN homozygous deficient breast cancer with different phenotypes have been successfully generated, which may provide useful resource for further investigation of the initiation and progression of HER2/ErbB2 breast cancer, as well as for the development of novel prevention and treatment regimens of this malignance.","title":"[Generation and comparison of two genetically engineered mouse models of ErbB2/Neu positive-PTEN deficient breast cancer].","pubmedId":"25187457"}
