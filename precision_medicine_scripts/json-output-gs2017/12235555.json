Age at diagnosis, intracranial meningiomas, and type of treatment center were informative predictors of the risk of mortality. In Cox models, the relative risk of mortality increased 1.13-fold per year decrease in age at diagnosis (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.18) and was 2.51-fold greater in people with meningiomas compared with those without meningiomas (95% CI 1.38-4.57). The relative risk of mortality in patients treated at specialty centers was 0.34 compared with those treated at nonspecialty centers (95% CI 0.12-0.98). In a separate model, the relative risk of mortality in people with constitutional NF2 missense mutations was very low compared with those with other types of mutations (nonsense or frameshift mutations, splice-site mutations, and large deletions), but the CI could not be well quantified because there was only one death among people with missense mutations. We conclude that age at diagnosis, the strongest single predictor of the risk of mortality, is a useful index for patient counseling and clinical management (as are intracranial meningiomas). To ensure optimal care, we recommend that people with NF2 be referred to specialty treatment centers.","title":"Predictors of the risk of mortality in neurofibromatosis 2.","pubmedId":"12235555"}
