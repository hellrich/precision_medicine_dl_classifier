We report a case of a 55 year-old woman, diagnosed with stenosing sigmoid cancer and liver metastases, which underwent multimodal treatment: palliative surgery -Hartmann segmental colectomy, and adjuvant chemotherapy -second line monotherapy with cetuximab, according to standard protocols. After 6 months of XELOX chemotherapy,during which she showed progression of metastatic disease, she was switched to monotherapy with cetuximab, with favorable outcome. Comparing relevant literature, in which complete response to treatment with cetuximab is obtained in low percentages ( 3%) after 3 months of treatment with cetuximab the patient shows clinical and paraclinical complete response and increased quality of life. Proper selection of patients with metastatic colon cancer for treatment with anti-EGFR therapy may lead to prolonged survival and time to progression.","title":"Efficacy of cetuximab in metastatic colon cancer - case report.","pubmedId":"24956345"}
