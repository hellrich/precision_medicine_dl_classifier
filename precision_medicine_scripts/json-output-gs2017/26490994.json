We have previously shown that extravillous trophoblast (EVT) lineage cells express ErbB2 and ErbB3, of which the potential as an oncogenic unit is well established. However, a physiological function of this receptor combination in humans remains a puzzling question. Here, we demonstrate neuregulin 1 (NRG1) expression and secretion by human decidual stromal cells. Stimulation of human primary trophoblasts with exogenous NRG1 induced phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and related downstream effectors. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the formation of ErbB2-ErbB3 dimers upon ligand engagement. Along this line, receptor knockdown and ErbB3 neutralization strongly diminished NRG1-dependent activation of the signalling complex. Functional studies revealed that NRG1 promotes EVT formation in placental explant cultures. Although, in the presence of NRG1, basal and camptothecin-induced trophoblast apoptosis was significantly repressed, this effect was abolished upon ErbB3 inhibition. Notably, camptothecin provoked a strong reduction of trophoblast cell column size, whereas NRG1-treated explants were refractory to the compound. Taken together, our findings newly identify a physiological function of the NRG1-ErbB2-ErbB3 axis in trophoblast survival during human placental development.
