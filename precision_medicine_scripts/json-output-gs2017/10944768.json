Partial resection and segmental resection are classified as limited resections for lung cancer to preserve pulmonary function. Minor complications occur more frequently with limited resection than with lobectomy. Partial resection of the lung and simple lobectomy can be performed as video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Systemic hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection is not yet standardized using VATS. On the other hand, VATS preserves chest wall muscles. The difference between standard thoracotomy and VATS is a difference of approach to the thoracic cavity. It is most important for lung cancer surgery to be performed in the thoracic cavity with the minimum burden on patients.","title":"[Limited operation of lung cancer: the role of video-assisted thoracic surgery for lung cancer].","pubmedId":"10944768"}
