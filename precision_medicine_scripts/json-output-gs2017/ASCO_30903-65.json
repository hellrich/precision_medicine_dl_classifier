Methods: A randomized multi-institutional phase II trial was designed to select metronomic chemotherapy (arm A: capecitabine 1 g orally twice daily for 14 days with one week break until tumor progression) or combined anti-inflammatory/angiostatic treatment (arm B: capecitabine as mentioned above plus etoricoxib 60 mg orally, day 1+, and pioglitazone 60 mg orally, day 1+) for further evaluation. Patients with refractory or progressive disease following any first-line therapy except capecitabine or frail were eligible. According to the one stage design, a sample size of 64 patients was calculated for the primary objective, improvement of response rate. Results: As similar response rates were observed (arm A/B 15/14%) after the accrual of 42 patients, the study was closed (n\u003d20 (A), n\u003d22 (B); median age 69 years (range 46 to 86ys); frail A/B n\u003d9/11). Median progression- free survival for arm A/B was 3.0/2.9 months (P\u003d0.878), and overall survival 5.0/6.1 months (P\u003d0.778). In both treatment arms a significant decline of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was observed within the first 4 to 6 weeks on treatment, A/B P\u003d 0.01/0.04, respectively. CRP response \u003e 50% from baseline was associated with a significantly improved overall survival in arm A/B (3.1 versus 11.0 months, P\u003d 0.023/ 3.3 versus 7.1 months, P\u003d 0.078) indicating an impact of inflammation-control on survival. WHO grade 3 (no grade 4) toxicities were reported in arm A/B in 20% and 23%, respectively, mostly due to hand-foot-syndrome. Conclusions: Metronomic low- dose chemotherapy in gastric cancer may induce anti-inflammatory response, but the chosen additional anti-inflammatory approach neither has impact on tumor-associated inflammation nor on response or survival rate. In a historical comparison, CRP-responder have similar outcome as patients treated with combination chemotherapy in first-line.","title":"Control of cancer-associated inflammation and survival: Results from a prospective randomized phase II trial in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_30903-65"}
