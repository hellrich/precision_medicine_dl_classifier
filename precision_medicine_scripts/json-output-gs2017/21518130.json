The well-known synchronous primary cancers of women are combined ovarian and endometrial cancers, especially when both are the endometrioid cell type. Although breast cancer and endometrial cancer are two common female malignancies, they often occur during the postmenopausal period. Therefore, the possibility of concomitant breast cancer and endometrial cancer in a younger woman (premenopausal) is often neglected. The reported case is an example of this situation. A 37-year-old woman was diagnosed with synchronous breast invasive ductal carcinoma and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Since this condition is rarely reported, the correlated risk factors are worthy of our attention and the strategy for prevention is highlighted.","title":"Synchronous breast invasive ductal carcinoma and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma: case report.","pubmedId":"21518130"}
