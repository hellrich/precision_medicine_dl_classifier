We analyzed EGFR and ERBB2 status in 105 gastric and gastroesophageal junction carcinoma and their clinicopathologic features. For EGFR, 92 (88%) tumors were scored as 0, 2 (2%) as 1+, 7 (7%) as 2+, and 4 (3%) as 3+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 4 (4%) tumors showed EGFR amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). For ERBB2, 90 (86%) tumors were scored as 0, 4 (4%) as 1+, 6 (6%) as 2+, and 5 (5%) as 3+ by IHC and 12 (12%) showed ERBB2 amplification by FISH. The concordance rate between IHC and FISH of EGFR was 98.1% (P\u003c0.001) and of ERBB2 was 93.3% (P\u003c0.001). Most tumors with ERBB2 amplification were tubular adenocarcinoma (N\u003d11, P\u003d0.02) and Lauren intestinal type (N\u003d12, P\u003d0.016). There was no statistically significant difference between EGFR amplification and tumor classification. EGFR amplification had significant impact on overall survival in certain subgroups: early stages (stages I and II) (P\u003c0.001), well to moderately differentiated tumors (P\u003d0.001), and fewer regional lymph node metastasis (pN1) (P\u003d0.001). ERBB2 status had little predictive value on overall survival. In conclusion, this study showed ERBB2 amplification was significantly observed in tubular adenocarcinoma and Lauren intestinal-type carcinoma. The IHC scoring criteria for ERBB2 can be applied to EGFR. EGFR amplification had associated with poor prognosis in early, well to moderately differentiated carcinoma.","title":"Assessment of EGFR and ERBB2 (HER2) in Gastric and Gastroesophageal Carcinomas: EGFR Amplification is Associated With a Worse Prognosis in Early Stage and Well to Moderately Differentiated Carcinoma.","pubmedId":"27753660"}
