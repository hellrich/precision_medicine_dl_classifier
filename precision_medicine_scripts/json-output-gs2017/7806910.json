All patients had confirmation of the diagnosis of malignancy either at operation, autopsy, or by clinical follow-up. FNA of liver metastases was positive for malignancy in 12 of 12 patients. FNA of the pancreas was performed on 44 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 11 patients with other pancreatic or peripancreatic malignancies. The diagnosis of cancer was established by FNA in 32 of 44 (72.4%) patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 1 of 11 patients (9.1%) with other pancreatic or peripancreatic malignancies. In the patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 17 of 18 patients (94.4%) who had no operative intervention, 12 of 18 (66.7%) patients who had palliative bypass procedures, and 3 of 8 (37.5%) patients resected had positive FNA. Eighteen of 24 patients (75%) who underwent intraluminal endoscopic biopsies, and 11 of 15 (73.3%) with ampullary carcinoma were positive. We believe that FNA is of limited value in the diagnosis of small resectable tumors of the pancreas as it identified cancer in only 3 of 8 patients in whom it was employed. False negative FNA may delay the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic malignancies. Patients in whom there is a high index of suspicion of pancreatic or peripancreatic malignancy based on clinical presentation, CT scan, or ERCP assessment do not require preoperative, histologic proof of malignancy prior to pancreaticoduodenectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Role of fine needle aspiration cytology and endoscopic biopsy in the preoperative assessment of pancreatic and peripancreatic malignancies.","pubmedId":"7806910"}
