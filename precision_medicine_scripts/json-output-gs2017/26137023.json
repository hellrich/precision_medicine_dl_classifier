Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is commonly used for the diagnosis and staging of PDAC in humans, and can be adopted for optimal use in animal experiments. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the carcinogenic process in a rat pancreatic carcinoma model using small-animal multimodality imaging systems. The utility of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT in detecting the location and size of PDAC during tumor development in the present transgenic rat model was assessed. A small animal multimodality PET/CT system and contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) system were used for the imaging analysis of KRASG12V male transgenic rats (n\u003d6), which developed pancreatic tumors following the administration of an injection of Cre recombinase (Cre)-carrying adenovirus. Laparotomies performed at six weeks post-treatment revealed that all three (100%) Cre-expressing rats developed pancreatic tumors that were \u003c2 mm in diameter, none of which were detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT or CECT. At eight weeks post-treatment, the pancreatic tumors were heterogeneously visualized by 18F-FDG-PET/CT and CECT in two of the three rats. Furthermore, the autopsies confirmed that all three rats had developed pancreatic tumors. These novel findings provide evidence that the FDG-PET/CT imaging system is a valuable tool for the evaluation of the carcinogenic process, and one which may aid in treatment and preventive methods for pancreatic tumors in mammalian models. A limitation associated with the early detection of PDACs warrants further investigation.","title":"In vivo18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of pancreatic tumors in a transgenic rat model carrying the human KRASG12V oncogene.","pubmedId":"26137023"}
