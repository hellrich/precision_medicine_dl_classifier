Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we sought to characterize various patterns of MDM2 amplification among the morphologic spectrum of liposarcoma.\nForty-six cases of liposarcoma in various sites were examined and included 22 WDLs, 14 DLLs, and 10 negative control subjects.\nThe MDM2 amplification ratio (MDM2/CEP12) was lower in WDL (10.2) compared with DDL (18.3) cases (P \u003d .0000002). An amplification ratio of 16 showed optimal sensitivity (0.86) and specificity (0.96) as a cutoff point for progression to DDL. Borderline areas, defined as tumors with increased cellularity and atypia but with preserved lipomatous differentiation, showed a significantly higher MDM2 ratio (17.5; P \u003d .0007) compared with WDL. Central (retroperitoneal and intra-abdominal) tumors also showed a significantly higher MDM2 ratio than peripheral ones (P \u003d .02).\nDifferences in MDM2 amplification profiles among liposarcomas could help further define and predict progression to high-grade neoplasia.","title":"MDM2 copy numbers in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma: characterizing progression to high-grade tumors.","pubmedId":"24515760"}
