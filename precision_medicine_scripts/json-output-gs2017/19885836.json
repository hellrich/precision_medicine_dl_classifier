In vitro studies of imatinib mesylate on cultured cardiomyocytes and biochemical studies of cardiac lysates from mice treated with imatinib mesylate were performed to define the potential cardiotoxic effects of imatinib mesylate.\nGrade 3 or 4 potentially cardiotoxic adverse events (mostly edema or effusions) occurred in 8.2% of patients, were manageable with medical therapy, and infrequently required dose reduction or discontinuation of imatinib mesylate. Arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, or heart failure were uncommon, occurring in \u003c1% of treated patients. However, administration of imatinib in a mouse model system resulted in inhibition of activation of protein kinases that are known to be important in the cardiac stress response.\nThe authors concluded that imatinib is an uncommon cause of cardiotoxicity, and that the cardiovascular adverse events that occur are manageable when recognized and treated. Nevertheless, our preclinical findings suggest that imatinib remains a potential cardiotoxin. Furthermore, the cardiac consequences of long-term imatinib therapy remain unknown. We therefore recommend treatment of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in imatinib-treated patients in accord with the American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heart failure.","title":"Rare incidence of congestive heart failure in gastrointestinal stromal tumor and other sarcoma patients receiving imatinib mesylate.","pubmedId":"19885836"}
