Male breast cancer usually presents with a palpable, nontender, retroareolar mass and occasional bloody discharge from the nipple. The typical age at presentation is between 60 and 70 years old (mean age of 67), which is significantly later than female presentation. Male breast cancer is generally diagnosed at a more advanced stage than female breast cancer.\nA 74-year-old white male presented to his primary care physician with a palpable, nontender 2.5 cm mass in the subareolar region of his right breast. The patient underwent a right mastectomy with right sentinel lymph node biopsy. The final surgical pathology revealed a 20 mm area of stage 0 intracystic papillary-type ductal carcinoma in situ.\nMale breast cancer is a relatively rare cause of morbidity and mortality among men. Screening for male breast cancer is not recommended for the general population but is encouraged for individuals known to be high risk. High-risk status is reserved for patients with extensive family history of breast cancer, known BRCA2 mutations, medical disorders causing hyperestrogenism, or radiation exposure.","title":"Palpable ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.","pubmedId":"25249812"}
