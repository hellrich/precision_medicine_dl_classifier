The primary clinical outcomes included the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The pooled relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) was estimated by using fixed-effects or random-effects models according to heterogeneity between studies.\nTen studies were considered eligible that included 1487 patients with mCRC. Patients who had tumors with the KRAS p.G13D mutation had a significantly higher ORR (10 studies; RR, 1.642; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.131-2.384), longer PFS (1 study; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36-0.81), and longer OS (1 study; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33-0.80) than patients who had tumors with KRAS codon 12 mutations. Compared with patients who had KRAS wild-type tumors, patients with the p.G13D mutation had a significantly lower ORR (9 studies; RR, 0.540; 95% CI, 0.381-0.765) and nonsignificantly shorter PFS (1 study; HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68-1.45) and OS (1 study; HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.66-1.54).\nPatients who had mCRC with the KRAS p.G13D mutation appeared to benefit more from cetuximab than patients who had tumors with KRAS codon 12 mutations. However, because of the limited sample sizes in the current meta-analysis, these results should be interpreted with caution.","title":"KRAS p.G13D mutation and codon 12 mutations are not created equal in predicting clinical outcomes of cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"22972628"}
