Peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping detected KRAS mutations in 47.2% of 72 PDACs. Low tumor cellularity and low PCR amplification efficiency led to be undetected or failed by direct sequencing in pancreatic paraffinized samples.KRAS mutations were an independent worse prognostic factor predicting a reduced progression-free survival rate in the postoperative chemotherapy group.\nPeptide nucleic acid clamp real-time PCR was a sensitive method for detecting KRAS status in paraffinized PDAC samples. We identified a low KRAS mutation rate among the Korean PDAC patients using PNA clamp real-time PCR, potentially implicating epidemiological characteristics. The low KRAS mutation rate and its prognostic role may suggest the further survival benefit in Korean PDAC patients.","title":"Low frequency of KRAS mutation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas in Korean patients and its prognostic value.","pubmedId":"25513781"}
