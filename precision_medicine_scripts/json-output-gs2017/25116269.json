We present a very rare case of high-grade meningioma with rhabdoid features that eventually expressed in a coma state. Comprehensive genomic profiling using a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay revealed three genomic alterations: activating BRAF mutation (V600E), loss of CDKN2A/2B, and APC I1307K. After treatment with BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib), the child\u0027s clinical condition improved progressively. After seven months, an MEK inhibitor was added (trametinib).
