CDK8 is amplified and differentially expressed in colorectal cancer and in certain hematological malignancies such as mantle cell lymphomas. Cells that express elevated CDK8 levels are highly dependent on its expression for proliferation. Here we report development of first-in-class selective inhibitors CDK8. Compounds from the SEL120 series have binding affinities towards CDK8 in the low nM range. Results from the kinome panel indicated that selectivity of SEL120 compounds was comparable with some of the most selective clinical kinase inhibitors. SEL120 compounds reduced viability of mantle cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer cell lines, with particularly good activity in cell lines overexpressing CDK8 and with G13D mutation in KRAS. Slightly lower sensitivity was observed for cells with mutated P53 and other mutations in KRAS/BRAF pathway. In contrast to pan-CDK inhibitors with main target activity on CDK9, treatment with SEL120 compounds did not repress phosphorylation of PolII and did not cause global transcriptional shutdown. Selective inhibition of CDK8 was sufficient to inhibit both paracrine and autocrine activities of cancer cells and stimulated normal cells. Production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 was repressed by SEL120 compounds in normal and cancer cells stimulated by sub-optimal doses of chemotherapeutics. SEL120 also reduced both murine and human IL6 in blood of mice bearing human xenograft models. Oral administration of SEL120 revealed favorable pharmacokinetics profile and strong, dose dependent potency in colon cancer mouse xenograft models. Presented data validate inhibition of CDK8 as a promising strategy for anticancer treatment, particularly for CRC and mantle cell lymphomas resistant to current treatments.","title":"Development of selective CDK8 inhibitors for colorectal cancer and mantle cell lymphoma treatment.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-696"}
