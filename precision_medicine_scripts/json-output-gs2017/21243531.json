Capecitabine and oxaliplatin doses were 400 mg/m(2) and 50 mg/m(2), respectively, at dose level 1; 600 mg/m(2) and 50 mg/m(2) at level 2; and 600 mg/m(2) and 60 mg/m(2) at level 3. A standard dose of gemcitabine was recommended following RT or following surgery (if done). The outcomes of patients treated with this regimen were retrospectively compared to 20 patients treated with 5FU-RT and 30 patients treated with GEM-RT.\nDose level 3 was tolerated with acceptable toxicity. Survival in patients receiving CAPOX-RT did not differ from GEM-RT or 5FU-RT. Response of the primary tumor was observed in 38% of patients treated with CAPOX-RT, 31% of patients treated with 5FU-RT, and 66% of patients treated with GEM-RT (p \u003d 0.03 GEM-RT versus 5FU-RT).\nCAPOX-RT has acceptable toxicity. A retrospective comparison shows higher response rate with GEM-RT versus 5FU-RT, but this difference did not translate into improvement in overall survival.","title":"Prospective phase I study of capecitabine and oxaliplatin concurrent with radiation therapy for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and retrospective comparison to concurrent 5-fluorouracil/radiation and gemcitabine/radiation.","pubmedId":"21243531"}
