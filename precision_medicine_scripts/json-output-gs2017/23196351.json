The data covers an average 119,956 (73,842 male and 46,114 female) workers at 1,159 worksites each year. The prevalences of obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking were calculated in 5-year age groups for each year. Overall prevalence estimates were adjusted for age using the indirect method.\nFor male workers, the crude prevalences of obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking were 26.9%, 19.0%, 22.7%, 6.9%, and 49.4%, respectively, in 2001, and 28.5%, 19.9%, 26.6%, 5.9%, and 34.4%, respectively, in 2011. The age-adjusted prevalence of hypercholesterolemia has increased over the 10-year period. Especially among those aged 50 years or over, significant increasing trends were found for obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. For female workers, the crude prevalences of obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking were 10.4%, 7.1%, 19.1%, 1.7%, and 16.6%, respectively, in 2001 and 11.6%, 7.4%, 16.7%, 1.7%, and 10.3%, respectively, in 2011. The age-adjusted prevalence of hypercholesterolemia has decreased over the 10-year period. Especially among those aged 40-59 years, a significant decreasing trend was found for hypercholesterolemia. Smoking prevalence showed a steady decrease among both male and female workers.\nOverall cardiovascular risk prevalence of Japanese workers has remained almost unchanged over the 10-year period, but there is a significant increasing trend in the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia among male workers. Male workers aged 50 years or over are identified as a subgroup requiring special attention, whose cardiovascular risk prevalence is increasing.","title":"[Changes in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in Japanese workers during decade 2001-2011].","pubmedId":"23196351"}
