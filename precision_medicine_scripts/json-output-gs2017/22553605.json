The cDNA of the mRNA in the paraffin sections of fetus and adult HLEC was synthesized by reverse transcription reaction. After PCR amplification, in situ hybridization test was performed with synthesized oligonucleotide probe and relative quantification was carried out using image analysis.\nHLECs of adults and fetuses expressed FGFR1 gene, the expression level was higher in fetuses than in adults. The difference between them had significance (P\u003c0.05).\nFGFR1 exist in HLEC and the expression is age-related, which could be one of causes of the high occurrence of post operational after-cataract in children.","title":"Comparison of FGFR1 expression on lens epithelial cells between adults and fetuses.","pubmedId":"22553605"}
