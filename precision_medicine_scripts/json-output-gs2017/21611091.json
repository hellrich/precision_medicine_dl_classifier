In recent years, more and more effort has been put on the relationship between pancreatic cancer and apoptosis. As a newly discovered inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin has drawn more attention. Strong evidence has shown that survivin is expressed in pancreatic cancer cells on frozen sections. Survivin increases in the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and its expression can be a marker in evaluating the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Survivin itself may be a new target in the treatment of pancreatic cancer and a survivin DNA vaccine could generate specific antitumor effects in pancreatic carcinoma models.","title":"Survivin and pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"21611091"}
