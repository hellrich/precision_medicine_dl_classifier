(Kris JAMA 2014)  The number of molecular lesions that can be targeted with drugs continues to grow and Next-Generation Sequencing permits more comprehensive testing of more aberrations with less tumor tissue. To translate these advances, we initiated LCMC 2.0 to test initial tumor specimens for 12 oncogenic drivers and to provide the results to clinicians for treatment decisions and research.  Methods:  The 16 site LCMC 2.0 is testing tumors from 1000 patients with lung adenocarcinomas in CLIA laboratories for KRAS, EGFR, HER2, BRAF, PIK3CA, MAP2K1, AKT1, and NRAS mutations, MET amplification, rearrangements in ALK, RET, and ROS1,and PTEN (MAb 138G4) and MET (MAb SP44) expression by immunohistochemistry. All patients were diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV after May 2012, had a performance status 0-2 and available tumor tissue.  Results:  Of 986 patients registered, data is now reported for 617. An oncogenic driver has been found in 52% (95% CI 49 to 56%). Drivers detected 13 RET  (2%, 95% CI 1 to 3%) , 17 ROS (1%, 95% CI \u003c 1 to 2%), 135 KRAS  (22%, 95% CI 19 to 25%), 77 EGFR (13%, 95% CI 13 to 15%), 20 ALK (3%, 95% CI 2 to 5%), 18 BRAF (3%, 95% CI 2 to 4%), 4 PIK3CA  ( \u003c 1%, 95% CI \u003c 1to 1%), 9 HER2  (2%, 95% CI \u003c 1 to 3%), 12 MET amplification (2%, 95% CI 1 to 3%), 3 NRAS ( \u003c 1%, 95% CI \u003c 1 to 1%), 1 MAP2K1 ( \u003c 1%, 95% CI \u003c 1 to 1%), 0 AKT1, 26 had    2 findings (4%, 95% CI 3 to 6%). PTEN loss was detected in15% (95% CI 12 to 17%) and MET expression in 54% (95% CI 50 to 58%). Next-Generation platforms were used at 81% of LCMC 2.0 sites. Results were used to select a targeted therapy or trial in 16%.  Conclusions:  Next-Generation Sequencing is rapidly becoming routine practice at LCMC 2.0 centers with use going from 0 to 81% of sites since 2012. LCMC 2.0 identified additional targets (RET and ROS1 rearrangements and PTEN loss) and detected an actionable oncogenic driver in the majority of initial lung adenocarcinoma specimens.
