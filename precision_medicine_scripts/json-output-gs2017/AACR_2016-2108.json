We established a cell line with acquired resistance to gefitinib by continuously exposing lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells to gefitinib. MET amplification was confirmed in this clone, designated as PC-9MET. In PC-9MET, no T790M mutation was detected in EGFR, and combined treatment with EGFR/MET inhibitors suppressed cell proliferation. To investigate further bypass pathways, we established a clone with dual-resistance to EGFR/MET inhibitors by exposing PC-9MET cells to increasing concentrations of MET-TKI (PHA665752) in the presence of 1 M gefitinib. This clone was designated as PC-9DR2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES. To investigate new bypass signals, we used a human phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (phospho-RTK) array. Cell proliferation and signal transduction were determined by MTT assay and Western-blot analysis, respectively. mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR. Mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines derived from IGF-1R-deficient mice and engineered to overexpress human IGF-1R were used to measure IGF bioactivity in cell culture media.RESULTS. In PC-9DR2 cells, up-regulation of IGF-1R activity was confirmed on phospho-RTK array, whereas MET expression was partially attenuated. Exposure of PC-9DR2 cells to the IGF-1R-TKI OSI906 plus the MET-TKI PHA665752 suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Interestingly, IGF-1R activation leads to PI-3K/AKT via IRS-1, and MET activation separately leads to ERK1/2 via Gab2. Furthermore, combined treatment with the MET-TKI PHA665752 and the IGF-1R inhibitor BI 836845, a humanized monoclonal antibody against IGF-1 and IGF-2, also suppressed cell proliferation, suggesting that increased ligand activation might lead to the phosphorylation of IGF-1R as a bypass signal. In a cell-based human IGF-1R phosphorylation assay, the culture medium of PC-9DR2 more potently phosphorylated IGF-1R than did the medium of PC-9MET cells. However, PC-9DR2 cells were not associated with increased expression of either IGF-1 or IGF-2, the ligands of IGF-1R. The insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP) are a family of six proteins that function as transport proteins for IGF-1 and IGF-2 in the circulation and regulate their access to the potentially oncogenic IGF-1R. The expression levels of IGFBP2 and IGFBP4 were significantly attenuated in PC-9DR2 cells. Moreover, exposure of PC-9DR2 cells to human recombinant IGFBP2 or IGFBP4 inhibited IGF-1R phosphorylation, and concurrent treatment with PHA665752 suppressed cell proliferation.CONCLUSION. Our findings suggest that combined treatment with IGF-1R/MET inhibitors might be of value clinically.","title":"Mechanism underlying acquisition of dual resistance to EGFR and MET inhibitors by EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2108"}
