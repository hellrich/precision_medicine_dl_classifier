The authors present a case series involving patients with characteristic periodontal features.\nThe authors assessed three patients, two of whom already had been diagnosed with BRRS: a 60-year-old man and his 33-year-old daughter, both of whom had pathognomonic oral and cutaneous manifestations, and a 26-year-old man affected by multiple micropapillomatous and keratotic periodontal lesions, through which the diagnosis of CD was made. All three patients were referred to the oral medicine unit of the authors\u0027 institution because of asymptomatic lesions of the oral mucosa, and two of them underwent incisional biopsy.\nThis series of cases emphasizes that oral health care workers always should perform a more careful visual inspection of the oral cavity without neglecting a macroscopic analysis of the gingival pattern. The knowledge of these diseases and their clinical features, associated with a multidisciplinary approach, allows clinicians to achieve remarkable diagnostic success.\nGingival manifestations may represent one of the primary clinically detectable manifestations of these rare systemic diseases, in respect of which an early diagnosis could decrease the associated mortality and morbidity.","title":"Oral manifestations of phosphatase and tensin homolog hamartoma tumor syndrome: a report of three cases.","pubmedId":"25170002"}
