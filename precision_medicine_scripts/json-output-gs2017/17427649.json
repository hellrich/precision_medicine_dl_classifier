We report a 71-year old male patient with cutaneous metastasis from an ampullary adenocarcinoma. The patient had a history of pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy for carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater two years prior to presentation. Physical examination revealed ill-defined, painful and hard erythematous nodules at the left thumb and distal phalanx of the right middle finger. The computed tomography scan showed low density masses in the retroperitoneum; the histological examination of a nodule from the right middle finger showed a metastatic adenocarcinoma. This case illustrates that cutaneous metastasis from ampullary carcinoma has a poor prognosis.","title":"Acral metastasis in a patient with ampullary carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17427649"}
