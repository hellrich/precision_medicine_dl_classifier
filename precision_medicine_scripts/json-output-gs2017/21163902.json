Methylation data were subjected to recursively partitioned mixture modeling (RPMM) to derive methylation classes. Differential DNA methylation between tumor and nontumor was also assessed. The association between methylation class and IDH mutation (IDH1 and IDH2) was tested using univariate and multivariable analysis for tumors (n \u003d 95) with available substrate for sequencing. Survival of glioma patients carrying mutant IDH (n \u003d 57) was compared with patients carrying wild-type IDH (n \u003d 38) using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nWe observed a statistically significant association between RPMM methylation class and glioma histological subtype (P \u003c 2.2 × 10(-16)). Compared with nontumor brain tissues, across glioma tumor histological subtypes, the differential methylation ratios of CpG loci were statistically significantly different (permutation P \u003c .0001). Methylation class was strongly associated with IDH mutation in gliomas (P \u003d 3.0 × 10(-16)). Compared with glioma patients whose tumors harbored wild-type IDH, patients whose tumors harbored mutant IDH showed statistically significantly improved survival (hazard ratio of death \u003d 0.27, 95% confidence interval \u003d 0.10 to 0.72).\nThe homogeneity of methylation classes for gliomas with IDH mutation, despite their histological diversity, suggests that IDH mutation is associated with a distinct DNA methylation phenotype and an altered metabolic profile in glioma.","title":"DNA methylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation, and survival in glioma.","pubmedId":"21163902"}
