Although no effective treatment is available, promising new strategies are being developed. A better understanding of the inner workings of the disease would undoubtedly lead to improved treatments. Mouse melanoma models have been used to elucidate many key regulatory pathways involved in melanoma initiation and progression, and models with mutations in the oncogenes RAF and RAS have been particularly informative. Here, we summarize and evaluate the human relevance of various RAF and RAS mouse melanoma models and their contribution to our understanding of melanoma.
