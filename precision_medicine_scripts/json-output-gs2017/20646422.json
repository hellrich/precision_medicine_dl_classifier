Immunohistochemical staining was employed to examine the expression pattern of BRSK2 translated protein. Semi-quantitative analysis was used to evaluate the intensity and content of protein expression in tumor tissues. The expression outcome was compared in peri-tumorous tissues and normal pancreatic tissues. Meanwhile, tumor samples were grouped according to their differentiation, TNM stage, with or without vascular or neural invasion. Then the possible relationship was explored between clinical, pathological and survival data and the expression profile of BRSK2 in tumor tissues.\nBRSK2\u0027s expression was weak in normal pancreatic tissues, including islets and minor ducts such as intercalated ducts, intralobular ducts and interlobular ducts. BRSK2\u0027s expression was also weak in peri-tumorous tissues. BRSK2\u0027s expression was strong in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. It had a close relationship with lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, TNM staging as well as peri-pancreatic neural invasion. Tumors with lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis and peri-pancreatic neural invasion or at later stages showed a higher expression of BRSK2 than those without or those at early stages. However the expression had no correlation with tumor size, differentiation and vascular invasion. The expression of BRSK2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas was correlated with the prognosis of patients. Those with a higher expression pattern showed a shorter survival period.\nBRSK2 is up-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. And its expression is correlated with tumor biological behaviors and patient prognosis.","title":"[Clinical implication of BRSK2 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"20646422"}
