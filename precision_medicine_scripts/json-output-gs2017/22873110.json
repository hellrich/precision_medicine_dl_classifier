One-third of malignant tumors arising in the retroperitoneum are sarcomas. Liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma and retroperitoneal sarcoma. Liposarcoma accounts for at least 20% of all sarcomas in adults and up to 41% of all retroperitoneal sarcomas. Here we present the case of a huge retroperitoneal liposarcoma and a brief literature review.\nA 34-year-old woman was referred to our hospital from a local clinic, because of abdominal distention, pain, and palpable mass. On admission we found that her abdomen was markedly distended. Computed tomography showed a the huge left ovarian mass that occupied almost the entire abdominal cavity. The mass consisted mainly of fat, and calcified material. She was operated under the diagnosis of a huge teratoma. The tumor was located in the retroperitoneal cavity and it abutted the left adnexa. The retroperitoneal tumor, including the left adnexa was removed. The tumor measured 22 x 15 x 11 cm, and showed many histological and pathological findings. On the basis of the histopathological finding, the tumor was diagnosed as a dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the retroperitoneum. The patient is presently undergoing radiation therapy.\nIn retroperitoneal liposarcoma, histological subtype, incomplete resection, contiguous organ resection, and older age are strongly associated with tumor-related mortality. For liposarcoma, it is necessary to customize the treatment strategy on a case-by-case basis.","title":"A huge retroperitoneal liposarcoma: case report.","pubmedId":"22873110"}
