The mutation status of the KRAS gene determines the benefits of molecular targeting drugs in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, although many methods are available to detect such mutations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of assay sensitivity on the detection frequency of mutated genes.\nColorectal tumors in 224 colorectal cancer patients were characterized for KRAS mutations using PCR amplification following by direct sequencing as well as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-clamp real-time PCR-based assay.\nKRAS mutations were observed in 32.1% (72/224) patients by direct sequencing, and 43.3% (97/224) by PNA-clamp PCR. The chi-square test revealed that the difference in the frequency of KRAS mutations determined by direct sequencing and PNA-clamped PCR (threshold for 1% detection) was statistically significant (p\u003c0.015).\nOur data suggest that assay method sensitivity clearly influences the detection frequency of mutated genes. As more sensitive assays detect more mutated genes in clinical samples, this must be taken into consideration when determining KRAS gene status in clinical practice.","title":"The frequency of KRAS mutation detection in human colon carcinoma is influenced by the sensitivity of assay methodology: a comparison between direct sequencing and real-time PCR.","pubmedId":"20361930"}
