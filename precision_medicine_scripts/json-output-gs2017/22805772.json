The time until progression and the clinical outcome of diffuse astrocytomas vary significantly. We have shown that IDH1 mutations reliably distinguish between primary glioblastomas (without IDH1 mutations) and secondary glioblastomas (with IDH1 mutations). The most frequent genetic alteration shared by primary and secondary glioblastomas is loss of heterozygosity at 10q (up to 60% of cases). Here, we first assessed The Cancer Genome Atlas data to identify gene loss at 10q in glioblastomas with or without IDH1 mutations. Using log-ratio thresholds of -1.0, 10 genes were identified; with the log-ratio thresholds of -2.0, only the DMBT1 (deleted in malignant brain tumor 1) gene at 10q26.13 remained as a deleted gene in glioblastomas with or without IDH1 mutations (12.5% vs 8.0%). We then analyzed a total of 404 gliomas by differential polymerase chain reaction and found a DMBT1 homozygous deletion at a similar frequency in primary and secondary glioblastomas (19.6% vs 20.8%). A fraction (11.3%) of diffuse astrocytomas showed a DMBT1 homozygous deletion that was significantly associated with a shorter overall survival (52.8 vs 84.0 months; p \u003d 0.003). These results indicate that a DMBT1 homozygous deletion is present in a fraction of diffuse astrocytomas and that it is associated with an unfavorable clinical outcome.","title":"DMBT1 homozygous deletion in diffuse astrocytomas is associated with unfavorable clinical outcome.","pubmedId":"22805772"}
