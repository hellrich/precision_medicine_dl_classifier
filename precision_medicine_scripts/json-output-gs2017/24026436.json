However, the role of gas5 in pancreatic cancer progression remains largely unknown. In the current study, we assay the expression level of gas5 in pancreatic cancer tissues and define the role of gas5 in the regulation of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. We verify that the expression level of gas5 is significantly decreased in pancreatic cancer tissues compared with normal control. Overexpression of gas5 in pancreatic cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation, whereas gas5 inhibition induces a significant decrease in G0/G1 phase and an increase in S phase. We further demonstrate that gas5 negatively regulates CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 6) expression in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, knockdown of CDK6 partially abrogates gas5-siRNA-induced cell proliferation. These data suggest an important role of gas5 in the molecular etiology of pancreatic cancer and implicate the potential application of gas5 in pancreatic cancer therapy.
