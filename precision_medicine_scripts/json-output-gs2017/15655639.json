A number of options are available to clinicians for the treatment of patients relapsing after surgical excision of their primary tumour, such as 5FU in association with FA, the new drugs such as irinotecan and oxaliplatin and the oral fluoropyrimidines: capecitabine and uracil/tegafur (UFT). It has been shown that combination therapy with 5FU/FA and irinotecan or oxaliplatin is more active than 5FU/FA in the first line of treatment in MCRC. New agents acting on novel targets are under development such as epidermal growth factor inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors.","title":"Chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"15655639"}
