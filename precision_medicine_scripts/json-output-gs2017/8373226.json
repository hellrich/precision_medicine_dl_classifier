The first case is a 47-year-old female. A total dose of 150 mg ADM was injected via reservoir. After satisfactory local response, mastectomy followed by giant rectus-abdominis musculocutaneous flap reconstruction was performed. The other case is a 64-year-old female. A total dose of 160 mg ADM was injected via reservoir. She was also operated in the same manner as in the first case. Complications of both cases were minimal. It was concluded that this combined treatment was useful for controlling local lesion and sustaining QOL.","title":"[Two cases of stage IIIb breast cancer treated by intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy using implantable reservoir combined with rectus-abdominis musculocutaneous flap reconstruction after mastectomy].","pubmedId":"8373226"}
