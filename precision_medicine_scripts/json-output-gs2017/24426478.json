Biliary complications in patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) at our institute between March 2007 and June 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. 32 patients underwent Deceased Donor Liver Transplantation (DDLT) and in 12 patients Living Donor Liver Transplantation (LDLT) was done. No patients were lost to follow up. Follow up ranged between 4 and 44 months. During the study period, 44 patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. Patients were divided into two groups: Biliary Complications group (BC) n \u003d 5 and Non Biliary Complications group (NBC) n \u003d 39. Biliary complications occurred in 15.9 % of patients. Bile leaks accounted for majority of biliary complications. Fifteen variables were analyzed as possible risk factors for biliary complications. Of these, split grafts, duct to duct biliary anastomosis and total blood loss were statistically significant (P \u003c 0.05) for biliary complications. Endoscopic treatment was successful in managing biliary complications in 75 % of patients. Biliary complications are the most common major complications in orthotopic liver transplantation. Significant risk factors are split liver grafts and duct to duct biliary anastomosis. Increased blood loss is a predictor for post operative biliary complications. These complications should be managed by endoscopic interventions. Surgery is indicated following failure of endoscopic interventions.
