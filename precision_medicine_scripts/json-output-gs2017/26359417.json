Proteins with this mutation are reported to be 130-fold more active, which results in induced proliferation, differentiation, cellular survival, and angiogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate tumor tissues, together with the surrounding non-tumoral tissues, for BRAF mutation presence, which may be an indicator for possible recurrence or prognosis as in the \u0027field carcinogenesis\u0027 model.\nThe BRAF V600E genotype of 152 colorectal adenocarcinoma paraffin-embedded specimens were determined by mutant-allele-specific amplification-polymerase chain reaction.\nAccording to our results, the presence of BRAF mutation increases risk of lymph node invasion by 1.55-fold [χ(2)\u003d3.83, p\u003d0.05, odds ratio (OR)\u003d1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u003d1.00-2.42], histologically medium or high-grade tumor by 1.60-fold (χ(2)\u003d4.34, p\u003d0.030, OR\u003d1.60, 95% CI\u003d1.03-2.48), vascular invasion by 1.55-fold (χ(2)\u003d3.55, p\u003d0.05, OR\u003d1.55, 95% CI\u003d0.99-2.42), perineural invasion by 1.50-fold (χ(2)\u003d3.16, p\u003d0.07, OR\u003d1.5, 95% CI\u003d0.96-2.33) and the combination of these poor prognostic features by 1.54-fold (χ(2)\u003d2.47, p\u003d0.11, OR\u003d1.54, 95% CI\u003d0.93-2.53). We also found that females are more prone to having the mutation and that being female increases the risk of having this mutation by 1.54-fold (χ(2)\u003d3.58, p\u003d0.05, OR\u003d1.54, 95% CI\u003d0.97-2.44).\nBRAF V600E mutation in non-tumoral surrounding tissue in patients with colorectal cancer may be used as a valuable marker to foresee clinical outcome or a possible recurrence. To our knowledge, this was the first study to take into consideration the non-tumoral surrounding tissues in addition to the tumor tissue.","title":"Co-existence of BRAF V600E Gene Mutation in Tumor and Non-tumoral Surrounding Tissues in Colorectal Cancer.","pubmedId":"26359417"}
