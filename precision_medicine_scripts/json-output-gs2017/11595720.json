Her-2/neu expression was a predictor for response to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the Her-2/neu cell surface receptor. Data regarding the expression of Her-2/neu in lung cancer are far more limited, and there is little information regarding the influence of Her-2/neu expression and response to trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. In this report we evaluated Her-2/neu gene expression by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and the cell surface expression of the Her-2/neu receptor by immunohistochemistry using the HercepTest and by FACS analysis in 31 lung cancer cell lines with 5 breast cancer cell lines as controls. By FACS, we found Her-2/neu overexpression (mean fluorescence intensity \u003e8) in 2 of the 22 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (9%), none of 11 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, and 4 of 5 breast cancer cell lines. A positive HercepTest (2+ or 3+) was found in 6 of 19 NSCLC cell lines (26%, 2+; 5%, 3+), 1 of 3 SCLC cell lines (33%), and 4 of 5 breast cancer cell lines (80%). One of 6 NSCLC cell lines examined (17%) had gene amplification with \u003e32 copies of Her-2/neu/cell and had homogeneous staining regions. One NSCLC cell line had a maximum of 14 copies of Her-2/neu/cell, and 3 had modest increases in Her-2/neu gene copy number without gene amplification (maximum 5-8 copies/cell). None of the SCLC cell lines had more than a maximum of 4 copies/cell, whereas the 2 breast cancer cell lines had maximum Her-2/neu copy numbers of 80 and 5, respectively. Aneusomy rather than true amplification was the major cause of increased Her-2/neu expression in most of the NSCLC cell lines. There was a strong correlation when the results of fluorescence-activated cell sorter, HercepTest results, and FISH were compared in pairs. Furthermore, Trastuzumab produced a G(1) cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition only in cell lines expressing Her-2/neu. The IC(50) for growth inhibition was correlated with cell surface Her-2/neu expression. The combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapeutic agents produced more than additive growth inhibition in cell lines expressing Her-2/neu, but the level of additivity was not related to the amount of Her-2/neu expression. These data indicate that trastuzumab alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic agents should be tested in NSCLC patients and that Her-2/neu should be assessed by both immunohistochemistry and FISH methods in these studies to determine which test is the best predictor of outcome.","title":"Expression of Her-2/neu in human lung cancer cell lines by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization and its relationship to in vitro cytotoxicity by trastuzumab and chemotherapeutic agents.","pubmedId":"11595720"}
