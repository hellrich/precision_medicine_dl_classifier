There was no evidence that pancreatic cancer was more common in patients with long-standing diabetes. The increased incidence of pancreatic cancer in diabetic patients is probably the result of patients presenting with the symptoms of diabetes as long as four years before the cancer becomes manifest. An underlying pancreatic tumour should be suspected when an elderly diabetic proves difficult to control and loses weight despite adequate treatment.","title":"Pancreatic cancer and diabetes mellitus.","pubmedId":"6242787"}
