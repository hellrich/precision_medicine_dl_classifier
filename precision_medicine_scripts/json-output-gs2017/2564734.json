Alterations and/or amplification of several oncogene sequences have been observed in primary human breast tumors, in breast tumor cell lines, and in mammary tumors in model systems. In principle, such alterations could be sites of primary lesions for human breast cancer, causes of tumor progression or metastasis, or simply secondary lesions of highly aberrant tumor genomes. The present study tested genetic linkage of breast cancer susceptibility to nine oncogenes in 12 extended families including 87 affected individuals. Lod scores for close linkage of each candidate sequence to breast cancer were -19.6 for HRAS, -12.3 for KRAS2, -1.0 for NRAS, -6.0 for MYC, -6.1 for MYB, -8.2 for ERBA2, -7.9 for INT2, and -5.1 for RAF1. Regions of chromosome 11p associated with tumor homozygosity and the region of 3p carrying the gene for Von Hippel-Lindau disease could also be excluded from linkage to human breast cancer. The 5-kb allele of the MOS oncogene, previously proposed to be associated with breast cancer, was absent in these families, suggesting that polymorphism at this locus is not associated with inherited susceptibility. These results strongly suggest that oncogenes are not the sites of primary alterations leading to breast cancer. On the other hand, alterations in one or more of these sequences may be associated with tumor progression.","title":"Oncogenes and human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"2564734"}
