To examine the effect of Brca2 deficiency on mutagenesis, we measured the spontaneous mutation rate at the endogenous hprt gene in the Brca2-deficient Chinese hamster cell mutant V-C8. A 4.3-fold increase was found in the spontaneous mutation rate at this locus, indicating the importance of Brca2 in the prevention of mutagenesis. In addition, following exposure to IR, a 2.3-fold increase in mutant frequency per Gy was found for V-C8 in comparison with wild-type V79. These data suggest a potential risk from ionizing radiation for BRCA2 patients.","title":"Brca2 (XRCC11) deficiency results in enhanced mutagenesis.","pubmedId":"14614187"}
