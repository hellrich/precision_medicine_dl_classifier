RANKL in bone has also been shown to serve as a chemoattractant for cancer cells, thu explaining the tropism of certain cancers such as breast and prostate cancer to preferentially metastasize to bone. Here, we will discuss the important role of RANKL and its possible role in the management of bone loss in patients with breast cancer.","title":"Targeting RANKL in the management of bone loss in patient with breast cancer.","pubmedId":"25345075"}
