From 30 to 40% of the tumors presenting this amplification show concomitant amplification at the FGFR1 locus in 8p12. Similarly, MDA-MB-134 breast cancer cells bear CCND1 and FGFR1 coamplified, resulting in the formation of a hybrid intrachromosomal amplification assembling 11q13 and 8p12 sequences. To learn whether similar amplified structures arise in breast tumors, we used a two-color FISH approach on interphase nuclei. A cohort of 225 breast tumors was analyzed by Southern blotting and a subset of 12 tumors presenting the 11q13-8p12 coamplification was selected for further study by interphase FISH. In 6/12 tumors the FISH signals for 11q13 and 8p12 probes formed colocalizing clusters of green and red spots in the nuclei. The FISH patterns were identical to those observed on MDA-MB-134 interphase nuclei hybridized with 11q13 and 8p12. These data, suggesting the formation in these tumors of a hybrid amplification domain in which 11q13 and 8p12 sequences are joined, were reinforced by dual-color FISH on extended chromatin showing that the said were sequentially aligned in these tumors. Furthermore, 3/6 nuclei with colocalized 11q13 and 8p12 amplifications showed fusion of centromeric sequences from chromosomes 8 and 11. Our data strongly suggest the occurrence, in approximately 3% of primary breast tumors, of a recurrent rearrangement involving the proximal portions of 8p and 11q and resulting in the formation of a hybrid amplified structure composed of 11q13 and 8p12 sequences.","title":"CCND1 and FGFR1 coamplification results in the colocalization of 11q13 and 8p12 sequences in breast tumor nuclei.","pubmedId":"9669664"}
