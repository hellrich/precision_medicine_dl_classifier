Oncogenic BRAFV600E mutations in colorectal cancer (CRC) are associated with poor prognosis and treatment resistance. BRAF mutations activate MAP kinase signaling and may confer apoptosis resistance by upregulating anti-apoptotic BCL-2/BCL-XL/MCL-1 proteins.Results. Ectopic expression of mutant BRAFV600E was shown to potently activate MEK/ ERK that mediated the phosphorylation (T163) and upregulation of MCL-1, but not BCL-2 or BCL-XL. MEK/ERK-mediated phosphorylation of MCL-1 (T163) increased its protein stability, shown by an MCL-1 phospho-mimic mutant. In human colon cancers, mutant vs wild-type BRAF was associated with increased MCL-1 expression by IHC. MEK/ERK inhibition by cobimetinib induced pro-apoptotic BIM in BRAF mutant CRC cell lines (HT-29, RKO), and suppressed phospho-MCL-1/MCL-1 proteins as did ERK siRNA. Suppression of MCL-1 by shRNA or using a small molecule MCL-1 inhibitor (A-1210477) synergistically enhanced cobimetinib-induced apoptosis (Table) that was associated with BAK/BAX activation. A-1210477 antagonized MCL-1 by disrupting its interaction with BAK and BIM proteins, shown by immunoprecipitation.Conclusion. BRAF/MEK/ERK induces upregulation of MCL-1 via phosphorylation/stabilization to confer apoptosis resistance that can be overcome by combined ERK and MCL-1 inhibition, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy against BRAF mutant CRCs.Drug-induced apoptosis (annexin V) in CRC cell lines","title":"MEK/ERK and MCL-1 inhibition synergistically reverse apoptosis resistance in colon cancer cells with BRAF(V600E)-mediated MCL-1-upregulation","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2115"}
