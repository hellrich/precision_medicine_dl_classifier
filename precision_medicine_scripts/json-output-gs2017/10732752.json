Uveal malignant melanoma (UMM) also occurs in a familial setting, or sometimes in association with familial or sporadic CMM. Molecular studies of sporadic UMM have revealed somatic deletions covering the INK4A-ARF locus (encoding P16INK4A and P14ARF) in a large proportion of tumours. We hypothesized that germline mutations in the p16INK4A, p14ARF or CDK4 genes might contribute to some cases of familial UMM, or to some cases of UMM associated with another melanoma. Out of 155 patients treated at the Institut Curie for UMM between 1994 and 1997, and interviewed about their personal and familial history of melanoma, we identified seven patients with a relative affected with UMM (n \u003d 6) or CMM (n \u003d 1), and two patients who have had, in addition to UMM, a personal history of second melanoma, UMM (n \u003d 1), or CMM (n \u003d 1). We screened by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism the entire coding sequence of the INK4A-ARF locus (exon 1alpha from p16INK4A, exon 1beta from p14ARF, and exons 2 and 3, common to both genes), as well as the exons 2, 5 and 8 of the CDK4 gene, coding for the functional domains involved in p16 and/or cyclin D1 binding. A previously reported polymorphism in exon 3 of the INK4A-ARF locus was found in one patient affected with bilateral UMM, but no germline mutations were detected, either in the p16INK4A, p14ARF or CDK4 genes. Our data support the involvement of other genes in predisposition to uveal melanoma.","title":"Individuals with presumably hereditary uveal melanoma do not harbour germline mutations in the coding regions of either the P16INK4A, P14ARF or cdk4 genes.","pubmedId":"10732752"}
