The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network revealed that EBVaGC also has distinct molecular features: PIK3CA mutations, DNA hypermethylation, and JAK2, PD-L1, and PD-L2 amplification. Here, we evaluated PIK3CA, JAK2, PD-L1, and PD-L2 expression in 59 EBVaGC and 796 EBV-negative gastric carcinoma (EBVnGC) cases using immunohistochemistry and found that PIK3CA, JAK2, PD-L1, and PD-L2 were highly expressed in 75.9% and 48.8% (P\u003c.001), 81.8% and 71.1% (P\u003d.091), 92.5% and 84.8% (P\u003d.132), and 98.1% and 89.7% (P\u003d.049) of the EBVaGC and EBVnGC cases, respectively. However, the expression of PIK3CA, JAK2, PD-L1, or PD-L2 was not significantly associated with clinicopathological features or patient outcomes in EBVaGC. In contrast, in EBVnGC, high PIK3CA expression was significantly associated with indolent clinicopathological features and independently predicted better 5-year overall survival (57.8% versus 33.4%, P\u003c.001). Our study indicated that the protein expression of the 4 characteristic molecules of EBVaGC was basically consistent with their genetic alterations, making them potential characteristic protein biomarkers and therapeutic targets of EBVaGC. The favorable impact of PIK3CA overexpression on survival found in this study gives us new insight into the clinical significance of PIK3CA in EBVnGC.
