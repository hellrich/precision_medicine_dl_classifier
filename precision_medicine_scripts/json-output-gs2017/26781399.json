Nine randomized phase III trials have compared EGFR-TKI with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients in a second or later line setting. Two of these trials, TAILOR and DELTA, which were designed to investigate treatment benefits according to EGFR genotype, demonstrated that docetaxel chemotherapy displayed significantly better in progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with the EGFR-TKI erlotinib. Biomarkers to predict clinical benefits of the drug against EGFR WT tumor, and the efficacy of combination regimens using erlotinib or single-use afatinib against tumors are also covered in this article.\nConsidering the modest benefits of erlotinib for EGFR-WT tumors, future studies are warranted, including the exploration of useful biomarkers and new treatment strategies for EGFT-TKI use, as well as the development of more sensitive EGFR mutation tests.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in previously treated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with wild-type EGFR.","pubmedId":"26781399"}
