Thirty-seven (25%) patients had 55 post-operative complications (17 had severe complications requiring surgical or radiological treatment). Two deaths related to postoperative morbidity had occurred. The risk of complications was increased with a radical hysterectomy (OR\u003d2.4; P\u003d0.04) and the presence of residual cervical disease (≤1cm: OR\u003d4.3, \u003e1cm: OR\u003d2.5; P\u003d0.01).\nIn the present study, the morbidity of completion surgery (based on hysterectomy with or without lymphadenectomy) is very high in patients treated with initial CRT for locally advanced cervical cancer whereas the therapeutic value of such surgery remains unproven.","title":"[Postoperative morbidity after completion surgery following homogeneous chemoradiation therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer].","pubmedId":"21030163"}
