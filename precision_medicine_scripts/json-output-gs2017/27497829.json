Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an anti-HER2 antibody conjugated with a vinca alkaloid, has been approved for clinical use in HER2+ breast cancer in many countries. Approximately 5% of NSCLC tumors possess HER2 alterations, and T-DM1 has shown excellent antitumor effects against HER2+ lung cancer cell lines in preclinical models. Therefore, we hypothesized that T-DM1 could significantly inhibit the growth of HER2+ lung cancers. We have launched a nonrandomized phase II trial of T-DM1 monotherapy for patients with HER2+ lung cancers. The major eligibility criteria are as follows: age ≥ 20 years, pathologically diagnosed NSCLC with documented HER2 positivity (immunohistochemistry 3+, both immunohistochemistry 2+ and fluorescence in situ hybridization positive, or exon 20 insertion mutation), and previous chemotherapy. Thirty patients will receive T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint is the overall response rate. This trial will provide information on whether T-DM1 monotherapy is effective against HER2+ lung cancer.","title":"Trastuzumab Emtansine in HER2+ Recurrent Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Study Protocol.","pubmedId":"27497829"}
