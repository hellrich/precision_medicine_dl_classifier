Target validation was achieved via RNA interference.\nG1 arrest induced by SB265610 occurred at concentrations lacking CXCR2 selectivity, persisted upon interleukin 8 (IL8) challenge, and did not affect IL8 downstream target expression. Profiling of G1 regulators revealed cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) (Thr160) hypophosphorylation, cyclin D3 gene down-regulation, and p21 post-translational induction. However, only cyclin D3 and CDK2 contributed towards G1 arrest. Furthermore, SB265610 induced a sustained phosphorylation of the p38MAPK. Pharmacological interference with p38MAPK significantly abrogated SB265610-induced G1 arrest and normalized the expression of cyclin D3, with restoration of its exclusive binding to CDK6, but with weak recovery of CDK2 (Thr160) hypo-phosphorylation.\nThe present study described the mechanisms for the anti-proliferative activity of SB265610 which may be of value in IL8-rich tumor microenvironments.","title":"Induction of G1 Arrest by SB265610 Involves Cyclin D3 Down-regulation and Suppression of CDK2 (Thr160) Phosphorylation.","pubmedId":"26026083"}
