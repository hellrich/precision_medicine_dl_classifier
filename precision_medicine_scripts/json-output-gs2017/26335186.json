In the cancer group, women subjected to CC treatment of at least 3 months in the past were included (n \u003d 37). For each survivor, one random selection from a base population control group was made (n \u003d 37) of a woman without a history of cancer and with similar socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. The sexual function was evaluated through the female sex function index (FSFI) instrument. Data collection occurred through the application of questions in a face-to-face interview.\nIn the cancer group, 64.9 % related vaginal stenosis or shortening; 59.5 % were not sexually active and of those which had sexual relations, 80 % showed dysfunction. The total FSFI score varied between 9.60 and 35.10 in the cancer group and 23.90 and 36.00 in the control group. The means of the cancer group were statistically inferior (P \u003c 0.05) to the control group in all the FSFI domains and in the total score. The mean total score was 21.72 in the cancer group, classified as sexual dysfunction when considering a score of 26 as the cutoff point.\nCC treatment was found to have a negative impact on the sexual function of women. Further, sexual function should be monitored routinely by interdisciplinary teams to provide comprehensive care with the objective of an improved quality of life post-cancer.","title":"Sexual function of women surviving cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"26335186"}
