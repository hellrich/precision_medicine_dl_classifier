We present the case of a 69-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of painful neck swelling. Imaging revealed a large right hemithyroid mass and a left hemithyroid nodule. Fine needle aspiration of the lesions and subsequent total thyroidectomy revealed a Hürthle cell carcinoma in the right lobe and bilateral multicentric papillary carcinoma foci, including 2 foci with a classical pattern and 1 encapsulated follicular variant in the isthmus. BRAF gene mutation analysis revealed V600E gene mutation in the classical variants of papillary carcinoma and in the Hürthle cell carcinoma. The focus of follicular variant of papillary carcinoma in the isthmus and a sample from normal thyroid tissue did not harbor BRAF mutations. This case is remarkable in being an unusual report of a follicular Hürthle cell carcinoma harboring the BRAF V600E mutation and occurring in collision with multifocal papillary carcinoma. Documentation of such cases is important as it helps better understand the pathogenesis, clinical behavior, and radiologic findings of such rare lesions and to determine the optimal treatment modalities.
