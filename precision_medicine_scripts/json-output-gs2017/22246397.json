We analyzed EGFR protein expression             and KRAS gene mutations in 5 mucinous ovarian carcinoma cell lines RMUG-L, RMUG-S,             MN-1, OMC-1 and MCAS and evaluated the in vitro and in vivo effects of cetuximab             on each. EGFR expression was observed in all cell lines except for MN-1 cells,             and a KRAS gene mutation at codon 12 was detected only in the MCAS cell line.             Cetuximab inhibited RMUG-L and OMC-1 cell growth in vitro and completely blocked             RMUG-L tumor growth in vivo. On the other hand, cetuximab did not affect MCAS             cell growth in vitro and only partially reduced the MCAS tumor growth in vivo.             These results suggest the possibility of targeted molecular therapy with cetuximab             for mucinous ovarian carcinoma cells lacking a KRAS gene mutation.","title":"Cetuximab inhibits the growth of mucinous ovarian carcinoma tumor cells             lacking KRAS gene mutations.","pubmedId":"22246397"}
