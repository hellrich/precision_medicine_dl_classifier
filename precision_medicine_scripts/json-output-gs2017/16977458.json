The impact of these aberrations on the metastatic potential and patient\u0027s survival was considered.\nFluorescent in situ hybridization was used to analyse the C-MYC and CDKN2A genes on isolated nuclei from 49 paraffin-embedded primary NMs.\nThirty-six (73.47%) melanoma samples showed CDKN2A deletion while 11 of these 36 (22.45%) additionally displayed C-MYC increased copy numbers. Cases positive for metastases more commonly displayed CDKN2A deletions. However, the combined C-MYC and CDKN2A aberrations were found predominantly in the non-metastasizing group of primary NM. The survival analysis furthermore demonstrated that patients with combined CDKN2A and C-MYC aberrations have a significantly better prognosis than carriers of CDKN2A deletion only.\nWe conclude that the C-MYC increased copy number changes on the background of CDKN2A deletions seem to be related to a low metastatic potential and better patients\u0027 outcome in primary NMs.","title":"Increased C-MYC copy numbers on the background of CDKN2A loss is associated with improved survival in nodular melanoma.","pubmedId":"16977458"}
