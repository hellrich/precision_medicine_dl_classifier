This meta-analysis aims to review all the studies reporting survival outcomes (recurrence free survival (RFS), and/or overall survival (OS)) of patients undergoing resection of CLM, stratified according to KRAS and/or BRAF mutation status.\nData from all published studies reporting survival outcomes (RFS and/or OS) of CRC patients who received resection of CLM, stratified by KRAS and/or BRAF mutation status were collected, according to the PRISMA guidelines. Pooled HRs were calculated for both the OS and/or RFS.\nSeven eligible trials (1403 patients) were included. Pooled analysis showed that KRAS mutations predicted a significantly worse both RFS (HR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.23-2.21) and OS (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.51-2.30) in patients who underwent surgical resection of CLM. BRAF mutations were also associated with a significantly worse OS (HR: 3.90; 95% CI: 1.96-7.73) in this subgroup of patients.\nThis meta-analysis suggests both KRAS and BRAF mutations as poor, prognostic biomarkers, associated with worse survival outcomes, in patients undergoing hepatic resection of CLM.","title":"Can KRAS and BRAF mutations limit the benefit of liver resection in metastatic colorectal cancer patients?
