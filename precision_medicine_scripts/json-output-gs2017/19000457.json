We investigated the expression of hPTTG1 in colorectal cancer tissues, and elucidated its correlation to some clinicopathologic parameters of colorectal cancer.\nThe expression of hPTTG1 in 60 specimens of colorectal cancer and corresponding noncancerous tissues were examined with real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and its correlation to seven clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed.\nThe mRNA level of hPTTG1 was significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissues than in corresponding noncancerous tissues (0.42+/-0.07 vs. 0.03+/-0.01, P\u003c0.001), significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissues with serum CEA level of \u003e 5 ng/mL than in those with CEA of \u003c 5 ng/mL (22.79+/-7.42 vs. 9.34+/-2.61, P\u003c0.001), significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissues with diameter of \u003e or \u003d 3.5 cm than in those with diameter of \u003c 3.5 cm (15.80+/-8.80 vs. 10.91+/-5.22, P\u003c0.05), significantly lower in Dukes\u0027A, B tumors than in Dukes\u0027 C, D tumors (9.03+/-0.35 and 9.58+/-2.93 vs. 15.88+/-8.09 and 25.69+/-7.67, P\u003c0.001), and significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissues with lymph node metastasis (17.63+/-8.47), liver metastasis (31.07+/-4.10) and other organ metastasis (22.78+/-6.39) than in those without metastasis (11.15+/-6.65) (P\u003c0.001). hPTTG1 expression had no relationship with patients\u0027 age, sex and histological type (P\u003e0.05).\nhPTTG1 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer. It is closely related to the progression of colorectal cancer, and may be helpful for prognosis prediction of colorectal cancer.","title":"[Expression of human pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 in colorectal cancer detected with real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and its clinical significance].","pubmedId":"19000457"}
