It affects both sexes, and is most prevalent at the age 50 to 70. Chronic nonspecific ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatolithiasis, congenital hepatic fibrosis, and Caroli\u0027s disease may lead to the increased incidence of CC. Recently, hepatic cirrhosis in the course of virus-associated chronic hepatitis has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis CC. Histologically, 90-95% of CC are well differentiated adenocarcinomas. Usually the tumor grows slowly and metastazes late locally and even less frequently extrahepaticly. CC often causes symptoms by blocking the bile ducts, abdominal pain, weight loss, signs of portal hypertension, rare ascites and thrombophlebitis. Serum chemistry was compatible with obstructive jaundice. The increased expression of CEA, Ca19-9, as well as loss or reduction of sialomucin/sulfomucin concentration in the biliary lining epithelium may be indicative of malignant changes. CC as usually non-vascularized nonencapsulated tumor with a large amount of fibrosis. It is isochogenic in classical USG, CT or MRI. MRCP-magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and virtual endoscopy are more helpful methods on the diagnostics of CC. Recently, FDG positron emission tomography has been suggested to be a sensitive technique in identifying small bile duct cancers. Surgical excision of the lesion confirmed localized CC. The adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy and transplantation are not satisfactory. Palliative therapy includes surgical biliary-intestinal bypass procedures as well as operative and nonoperative techniques for biliary intestinal drainage. Recently, the local treatment of CC by photodynamic therapy as a palliative strategy is very promising. Ordinary CC is reported as a neoplasm with a poor prognosis. Post resection 5-year survival is affirmed in about 25% of CC, whereas after palliative treatment only 1 year.","title":"[Cholangiocarcinoma--bile ducts cancer].","pubmedId":"12901270"}
