The role of HER2/CEP17 ratio on recurrence-free survival was assessed with univariate and multivariate Cox regression models.\nWe found no significant association between risk of recurrence and HER2 equivocal testing in patients with early breast cancer. In subgroup analysis, a significant interaction between HER2/CEP17 ratio and nodal involvement was observed (p\u003d0.02).\nPatients with HER2 equivocal status have no significantly higher risk of recurrence.","title":"HER2 Equivocal Status in Early Breast Cancer Is Not Associated with Higher Risk of Recurrence.","pubmedId":"27354620"}
