{"organisms":["6755"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Advances in the understanding of genomic alterations in cancer, and the various therapies targeted to these alterations have permitted the design of trials directed to bringing this science to the clinic, with the ultimate goal of tailoring therapy to the individual. There is a high need for advances in targeted therapy in colorectal cancer, a disease in which only 2 classes of targeted therapies are approved for use in colorectal cancer, despite the majority of colorectal cancers containing a potentially targetable mutation. Here we outline the key elements to the design of these clinical trials and summarize the current active molecular triage trials in colorectal cancer.
