We conducted this study to clarify if TS and DPD gene expressions are a prognostic indicator for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC).\nThe subjects of this study were 21 patients with IHCC who had undergone surgical resection. Intratumoral TS and DPD mRNA expressions were examined using the Danenberg tumor profile method and classified into two groups according to the median value of each. We then compared the clinicopathological variables, including prognosis, between the high and low expression groups.\nLow DPD expression was correlated with macroscopic type, namely, mass-forming + infiltrative (P \u003d 0.08). Postoperative survival rates in the low DPD expression group were significantly lower than those in the high DPD expression group. Multivariate analysis revealed macroscopic type to be an independent prognostic factor, whereas TS mRNA expression did not correlate with any clinicopathological variables, including prognosis.\nLow DPD mRNA expression was related to macroscopic type and associated with poor prognosis. DPD mRNA expression in tumor cells is suggested to be an important regulator of malignant behavior in IHCC.","title":"Role of thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase mRNA in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22143355"}
