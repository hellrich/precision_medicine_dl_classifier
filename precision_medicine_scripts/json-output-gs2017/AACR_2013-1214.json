Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the EGFR and ALK proteins are effective in the treatment of lung adenocarcinomas that carry EGFR mutations and ALK fusions, respectively. We performed whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing) of 30 lung adenocarcinoma specimens from Japanese individuals to identify new chimeric fusion transcripts that could be targets for therapy. Then, we identified KIF5B (kinesin family 5B)-RET fusion gene, as another druggable oncogene that is present in 2% (6/319) of lung adenocarcinomas (Kohno et al., Nat Med, 2012). The KIF5B-RET fusion leads to aberrant activation of RET kinase and is considered to be a new driver mutation segregating from mutations or fusions in EGFR, KRAS, HER2 and ALK. The RET fusion has preferentially been detected in well or moderately differentiated tumors of never smokers. The RET fusion in lung adenocarcinoma was also identified by three other groups: Dr. Ju et al of Seoul National University, Dr. Takeuchi et al of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, and Dr. Lipson et al of Foundation Medicine, USA. A clinical trial to address the therapeutic efficacy of a RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, will be started in 2013 by Dr. Koichi Gotoh (kgoto@east.ncc.go.jp) of National Cancer Center Hospital East, Japan.","title":"RET fusion gene: translation to the therapy of lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-1214"}
