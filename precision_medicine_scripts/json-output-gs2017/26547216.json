We evaluated the utility of NRAS codon 61 (NRAS61) mutation analysis and core needle biopsy (CNB) for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules previously diagnosed as AUS. This study enrolled 236 patients who underwent both NRAS61 mutation analysis and CNB of thyroid nodules previously diagnosed as AUS at cytology. The NRAS61 mutation was detected in 36 nodules and was more frequently detected in the AUS and follicular neoplasm (FN)/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (SFN) categories, as determined by histological analysis of CNB, than in the benign group (p \u003d 0.005). Sixty-one patients underwent surgery, and 29 nodules were finally diagnosed as malignant after surgery. Among 61 patients who underwent surgery, nodules with the NRAS61 mutation (42-65 %) had a significantly higher malignancy rate than nodules with wild-type NRAS61 (7-37 %, p \u003d 0.038). The association between malignancy and the NRAS61 mutation was significant after adjusting for age, sex, nodule size, and histological diagnosis of CNB (p \u003d 0.01). NRAS61 mutation analysis together with CNB could be helpful for arriving at a clinical decision in patients with thyroid nodules showing AUS in a previous cytology.","title":"Usefulness of NRAS codon 61 mutation analysis and core needle biopsy for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules previously diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance.","pubmedId":"26547216"}
