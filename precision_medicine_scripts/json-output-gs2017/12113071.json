Multimodal treatment option has been investigated, such as the concurrent use of chemotherapy and radiation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical hysterectomy, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. Recently, a flow of randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a benefit from the concurrent chemoradiation for the treatment of the cancer of the cervix. This review will summarize the role and benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with sequential or concurrent radiotherapy and radical surgery for treatment of cervical cancer.","title":"Current approaches of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"12113071"}
