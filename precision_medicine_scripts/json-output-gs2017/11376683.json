By utilizing growth factor-transformable NRK cells and its insensitive mutants, we recently found that oncogenic stimulation invokes Cdk6 to participate in a critical step of the cell cycle start, but not via the regulation of its catalytic activity and that Cdk6 participation closely correlates with the anchorage-independent growth ability. Since many hematopoietic cells employ predominantly Cdk6 for the cell cycle start and perform anchorage-independent growth by nature, this finding raises the possibility that the mechanism by which oncogenic stimulation invokes anchorage-independent growth of NRK cells is similar to the one used for hematopoietic cell proliferation. We discuss this novel mechanism and its implication.","title":"Oncogenic cell cycle start control.","pubmedId":"11376683"}
