The age, sex, location of tumor, cell type, the presence of hemorrhage, and c-kit expression were independently related to the presence of c-kit mutation.\nThe c-kit gene mutation is an important prognostic factor for GIST.","title":"[Effect of c-kit gene mutation on prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor].","pubmedId":"15062057"}
