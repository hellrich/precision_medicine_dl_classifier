The cytologic diagnoses were classified into three groups: malignant, suspicious, or benign. Histopathologic correlation was based on either a needle core biopsy, an excisional biopsy, or a mastectomy specimen.\nA total of 1,158 fine-needle aspirations performed between 1982 and 2000, on women being evaluated for a clinically palpable breast mass were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups: group I consisted of 231 patients aged 40 years and younger, and group II consisted of 927 patients aged 41 years and older. In group I there were 117 (51%) malignant FNA diagnoses, and only 1 (1%) false-positive case, subsequently diagnosed on histopathologic material as an atypical papillomatosis. There were 20 (9%) cases diagnosed as suspicious on FNA. On histopathology 10 were malignant, and 10 were benign. Of the 91 (39%) cases interpreted as benign, only 1 (1%) was a false negative. In group II, which comprised 927 patients, there were 693 (74%) malignant FNA diagnoses, and 3 (less than 1%) false-positive cases, which on follow-up histopathologic examination revealed 2 atypical ductal hyperplasias and 1 atypical papilloma. There were 90 (10%) cases diagnosed as suspicious on FNA. On histopathology, 68 were malignant and 22 were benign. Of the 131 (14%) lesions interpreted as benign, there were 18 false-negative cases (14%), which included 17 infiltrating carcinomas and 1 ductal carcinoma in-situ. Twelve (1%) of the cases were inadequate for the study.\nThe sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were remarkably high and comparable in both groups: group I had 99% sensitivity, 99% positive predictive value, 99% specificity, and 99% negative predictive value; and group II had 98% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 99% positive predictive value, and 86% negative predictive value. The overall rate of false-positive (less than 1%) and false-negative cases (9%) is comparable with published literature. Suspicious cases should be further evaluated, as our study revealed more than 50% to be malignant. The incidence of malignancy in patients presenting with a clinically palpable breast mass with follow-up biopsy was 51% in patients aged 40 years and younger and 74% in patients aged 41 years and older. Fine-needle aspiration is an excellent diagnostic tool in assessing clinically palpable breast masses.","title":"Fine-needle aspiration of clinically suspicious palpable breast masses with histopathologic correlation.","pubmedId":"12433603"}
