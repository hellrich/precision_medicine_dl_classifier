AVAPERL1 is designed to investigate if continuing pem with bev offers additional benefit over bev alone following 1L bev-cis-pem therapy.  The study is fully enrolled and is ongoing. Methods: Eligible pts with advanced, metastatic or recurrent nsNSCLC received 4 cycles of 1L therapy with bev (7.5 mg/kg)-cis (75 mg/m2)-pem (500 mg/m2) q3w.  Pts with CR/PR/SD were randomized to receive bev or bev-pem until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI CTC v.3.0. Results: As of 08 Oct 10, 373 pts who received  1 dose of any study drug were included in the safety analysis.  Baseline characteristics (%): male 59; stage IV 92; adenocarcinoma 88; ECOG PS 0/1 45/53; median age 60 yr.  Median follow-up time was 4.4 months; 43% of pts are on treatment, 34% in follow-up and 23% off-study.  227 pts (61%) completed 1L therapy and initiated mtc therapy. AEs are summarized in the table.  Consistent with the safety profile of regimens indicated for use with bev, the most common grade (G) 3 AEs by % pts are: neutropenia  (8), embolism (3), hypertension, anemia, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hyperglycemia, pneumonia and dyspnea (2 each).  The most common SAEs by % pts are pneumonia (3), dyspnea, embolism, pulmonary embolism, neutropenia, renal failure and nausea (2 each). Conclusions: 1L bev-cis-pem was well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to that of regimens indicated for use with bev; most AEs were G 1/2. 61% of pts initiated mtc; to date, the incidence of G 3 AEs was similar in both mtc arms, but more SAEs were reported in patients treated with bev-pem.Safetypopulationn\u003d373Bev mtcn\u003d110Bev-pem mtcn\u003d117AE any G, n2,8778671,134Pts with any G AE, n (%)345 (92)102 (93)110 (94)AE G 3, n3005544Pts with G 3 AE, n (%)169 (45)38 (35)45 (38)SAE, n1982955Pts with SAE, n (%)131 (35)22 (20)36 (31)Pts with AE by phase, %1L878286Mtc426572Pts with AE by intensity, %G 1/282/7185/7390/74G 3/439/831/437/6G5532","title":"AVAPERL1 (MO22089): Maintenance (mtc) bevacizumab (bev) with or without pemetrexed (pem) in patients (pts) with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsNSCLC) treated with first-line (1L) bev-cisplatin (cis)-pem: Interim safety data.","pubmedId":"ASCO_78255-102"}
