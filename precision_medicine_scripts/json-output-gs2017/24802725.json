NRAS mutations (4/24, 21%) were more prevalent than KIT mutations (1/24, 4%), while BRAF mutations were absent. Three of four NRAS mutations were present in vaginal melanomas (21%), mainly affecting codon 61 (3/4). They were mutually exclusive with the KIT mutation. The KIT mutation was present in a vaginal melanoma and affected exon 17.\nMelanomas of the female urogenital tract relatively commonly harbor mutations in NRAS; this makes NRAS an interesting therapeutic target for these patients in the advanced setting. KIT mutations were rare in our study in contrast to some previous reports. We cannot exclude that anatomical site-related differences and/or population related differences in KIT mutation frequency exist within urogenital tract melanomas.","title":"NRAS mutations are more prevalent than KIT mutations in melanoma of the female urogenital tract--a study of 24 cases from the Netherlands.","pubmedId":"24802725"}
