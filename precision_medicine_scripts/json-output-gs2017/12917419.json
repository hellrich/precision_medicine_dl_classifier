The activating V599E mutation accounted for 80% of all mutations detected in cutaneous melanoma cell lines. Reconstitution experiments have shown that this mutation increases ectopically expressed B-Raf kinase activity and induces NIH3T3 cell transformation. Here we used tumor-derived cell lines to characterize the activity of endogenous mutated B-Raf protein and assess its specific role in transformation. We show that three cell lines (OCM-1, MKT-BR, and SP-6.5) derived from human choroidal melanoma, the most frequent primary ocular neoplasm in humans, express B-Raf containing the V599E mutation. These melanoma cells showed a 10-fold increase in endogenous B-RafV599E kinase activity and a constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK pathway that is independent of Ras. This, as well as melanoma cell proliferation, was strongly diminished by siRNA-mediated depletion of the mutant B-Raf protein. Moreover, blocking B-RafV599E-induced ERK activation by different experimental approaches significantly reduced cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of melanoma cells. Finally, quantitative immunoblot analysis allowed us to identify signaling and cell cycle proteins that are differentially expressed between normal melanocytes and melanoma cells. Although the expression of signaling molecules was not sensitive to U0126 in melanoma cells, the expression of a cluster of cell cycle proteins remained regulated by the B-RafV599E/MEK/ERK pathway. Our results pinpoint this pathway as an important component in choroidal melanoma cell lines.","title":"Mutation of B-Raf in human choroidal melanoma cells mediates cell proliferation and transformation through the MEK/ERK pathway.","pubmedId":"12917419"}
