{"keywords":["CD117","Extra-gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor","retroperitoneum"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract. More rarely neoplasms with histology and immunohistochemistry similar to GISTs may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract ( omentum, mesentery and retroperitoneum) and are so-called Extra-gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (EGISTs). EGISTs arising in the retroperitoneum are extremely rare: to date, only 58 cases have been reported in the literature.\nWe herein report a case of a primary EGIST of the retroperitoneum surgically treated. The pre-operative radiological evaluation showed a retroperitoneal mass, placed in left paravertebral region.\nMorphological and immunohistochemical features led to a diagnosis of extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumor (intermediate-low risk form).\nAs a result of the rarity of reports of primary EGISTs of retroperitoneum we need to analyze the data of reported cases in order to gain a better understanding about the pathogenesis, prognosis and optimal treatment of this disease.","title":"Primary Extra-gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor of Retroperitoneum.","pubmedId":"22563251"}
