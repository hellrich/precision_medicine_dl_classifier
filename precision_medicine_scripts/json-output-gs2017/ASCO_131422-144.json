Methods:  We retrospectively examined NSCLC pts with EGFR mutations treated with EGFR-TKIs, and evaluated patient characteristics and serum tumor markers from the perspective of prognosis. Survival time was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression modeling.  Results:  Participants comprised 159 pts, among whom 106 were women, 115 were never- or light smokers, and 155 had with adenocarcinoma. Deletions in exon 19 were seen in 76 pts, the L858R mutation in 67, and other EGFRmutations in 16. All pts were treated with EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, n\u003d110; erlotinib, n\u003d28; both sequentially, n\u003d17; other, n\u003d4). No significant relationship was observed between response rate and patient characteristics; however, progression-free survival (PFS) with EGFR-TKI treatment was significantly associated with ECOG PS at start of treatment with EGFR-TKI (good PS [0,1] vs. poor PS [2-4], MST 10.9 m vs. 7.0 m; p\u003c0.001), serum albumin level (low [\u003c3.5 mg/dl] vs. high, 8.9 m vs. 10.9 m; p\u003d0.003), LDH level (low [\u003c250 IU/l] vs. high, 10.8 m vs. 7.2 m; p\u003d0.01), CEA level (normal [\u003c5 ng/ml] vs. high, 13.2 m vs. 9.5 m; p\u003d0.007) and CYFRA 21-1 level (normal [\u003c3.5 ng/ml] vs. high, 11.4 m vs. 8.9 m; p\u003d0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that good PS was independently associated with PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; p\u003d0.04). Overall survival (OS) from starting treatment with EGFR-TKI was significantly associated with PS (good vs. poor, 25.5 m vs.17.1 m; p\u003c0.001), albumin level (low vs. high, 14.3 m vs. 25.5 m; p\u003c.001), LDH (25.5 m vs. 17.8 m; p\u003c0.001), CEA (normal vs high, 63.1 m vs. 21.5 m; p\u003c0.001), CYFRA 21-1 (32.2 m vs. 16.0 m; p\u003c0.001) and smoking status (never- or light smoker vs. heavy smoker, 24.8 m vs. 19.4 m; p\u003d0.03). Multivariate analysis revealed high CEA level (HR, 3.01; p\u003d0.002), high CYFRA 21-1 level (HR, 2.24; p\u003d0.01) and low albumin level (HR, 2.04; p\u003d0.04) as independently associated with poor prognosis.  Conclusions:  Serum CEA and CYFRA 21-1 levels represent independent prognostic factors not related to anti-tumor effect or PFS of EGFR-TKI treatment in NSCLC pts with EGFR mutations.","title":"Retrospective analysis of prognostic factors in non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations.","pubmedId":"ASCO_131422-144"}
