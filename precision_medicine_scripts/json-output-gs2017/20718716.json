It is characterized by activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase genes c-kit or PDGFRA. This study examined the mutation rate and type in a population-based material. All gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors over the years 1990-2004 were evaluated and GIST tumors identified using immunohistochemistry (c-kit) and conventional pathologic parameters. Paraffin sections from all tumors were subjected to mutation analysis on exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 of the c-kit gene and exons 12 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene. To screen for mutations, we used a highly sensitive conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) and to define the mutated alleles, we employed direct automated DNA sequencing. All c-kit-positive gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors were entered into the study. Fifty-six tumors from 55 patients were analyzed. Mutations were found in 52 tumors representing a 92.9% mutational rate. Most of the mutations were found in c-kit exon 11 (76.8%), followed by c-kit exon 9 (10.7%). PDGFRA mutations were only found in three tumors. No correlation of mutation type with biologic behavior was found. This population-based study, using a sensitive CSGE method, identifies mutations in the great majority of patients with GIST.","title":"Tyrosine kinase mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors in a nation-wide study in Iceland.","pubmedId":"20718716"}
