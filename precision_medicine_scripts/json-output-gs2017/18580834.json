R0 (no residual disease) resection is the only curative measure. Surgical extirpation of gastric cancer is indicated in patients with stages I, II, and III disease, with minimal lymph node involvement. Tumor size and location dictate the type of surgical procedure to be used. The type of gastrectomy and the extent of lymphadenectomy must be carefully planned for each individual patient with gastric cancer. Current issues are - subtotal versus total gastrectomy, extended lymphadenectomy and \"prophylactic\" splenectomy.","title":"[Gastric cancer - current state of the problem (II part).
