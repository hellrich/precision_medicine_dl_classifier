Dovitinib (TKI258) is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that demonstrated potent antitumor activities in FGFR1-amplified tumor cell lines. This phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dovitinib in metastatic HER2- BC. Methods: Patients were stratified into 4 groups based on FGFR1 and hormone receptor (HR) tumor subtype: 1) FGFR1+, HR+; 2) FGFR1+, HR-; 3) FGFR1-, HR+; 4) FGFR1-, HR-. Screening for FGFR1 status was performed by fluorescence/chromogenic in situ hybridization (cutoff  6 gene copies). Dovitinib (500 mg) was administered once daily on a 5-day-on/ 2-day-off schedule. The primary endpoint was RECIST best overall response rate in patients with measurable disease per external radiology review. Results: Data from 77 of 81 treated patients were available as of January 2011 (n\u003d21, n\u003d34, n\u003d22 in groups 1, 3, 4, respectively). Median number of prior therapies in the metastatic setting was 2 chemotherapy lines (all patients) and 2 endocrine therapy lines (HR+ patients). Liver metastases were present in 58% of patients (81%, 50%, 50% in groups 1, 3, 4, respectively). Most common adverse events included vomiting (75%; grade 3 [g3]: 6%), diarrhea (72%; g3: 6%), nausea (62%; g3: 5%), and asthenia (61%; g3: 17%). Median dovitinib exposure was 1.7 (range, 0-8.2) months, including 8 patients with \u003e 4 months of therapy. Of patients with measurable disease at baseline, in group 1, 13% had unconfirmed partial responses and 44% had stable disease  4 months (SD4). In groups 3 and 4, 29% and 11% had SD4. Conclusions: This is the first trial reporting efficacy of an FGFR1 inhibitor in patients with FGFR1-amplified BC. Dovitinib showed antitumor activity in patients with HR+, FGFR1- amplified BC and disease stabilization in other subgroups. FGFR1 is likely a relevant target in BC, and FGFR1 amplification may define a segment of dovitinib-sensitive disease. Further evaluation of dovitinib in patients with HR+ BC is planned.","title":"A multicenter, open-label phase II trial of dovitinib, a fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) inhibitor, in FGFR1-amplified and nonamplified metastatic breast cancer (BC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_86550-111"}
