We aim to define the demographics, imaging features of cHCC-CC on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in this study.\nFrom January 2005 to December 2014, 45 patients with pathologically proven cHCC-CC who underwent preoperative CEUS and 43 patients who had additional CT scan in our institution were included. A retrospective review of the imaging studies and clinical data in these patients was conducted.\nIn our series, cHCC-CC accounted for 1.6 % of all primary liver malignancy. Mean age of patient with cHCC-CC was 52.8 year (range: 28-74 year) and 88.9 % (40/45) of patients were male. Thirty of forty five patients (66.7 %) had cirrhosis and 20 % (9/45) of patients had chronic hepatitis B without cirrhosis. Alpha--fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated in 62.2 % (28/45) of patients and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) elevated in 22.2 % (10/45) of patients). Both AFP and CA19-9 were simultaneously elevated in 15.6 % (7/45) of patients. Enhancement pattern resembling cholangiocarcinoma (CC) was noted in 53.3 % (24/45) of patients (on CEUS and in 30.2 % (13/43) of patients at CT. Enhancement pattern resembling hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was observed in 42.2 % (19/45) of patients on CEUS and in 58.1 % (25/43) of patients at CT. The percentage of tumors showing CC enhancement pattern (27.9 %, 12/43) was comparable with that of tumors showing HCC enhancement pattern (44.2 %, 19/43) on both CEUS and CT (p \u003d 0.116). Simultaneous elevation of tumor markers (AFP and CA19-9) or tumor marker elevation (AFP or CA19-9) in discordance with enhancement pattern on CEUS was demonstrated in 51.1 % (23/45) of patients and on CT in 53.5 % (23/43) of patients, which was significantly more than simultaneous elevation of tumor markers (AFP and CA19-9) alone (p \u003d 0.000).\nThe clinical characteristics of cHCC-CC are similar to those of HCC. The cHCC-CC tumors display enhancement patterns resembling CC or HCC in comparable proportion on both CEUS and CT. Combination of simultaneous elevation of tumor makers (AFP and CA19-9) and tumor mark elevation (AFP or CA19-9) in discordance with presumptive imaging findings on CEUS or CT may lead significantly more patients to be suspicious of the diagnosis of cHCC-CC.","title":"Combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (biphenotypic) tumors: clinical characteristics, imaging features of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and computed tomography.","pubmedId":"26917546"}
