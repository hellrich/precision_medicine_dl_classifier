However, the molecular basis for cell death or survival signaling in response to radiation is unclear at present. Here, we show opposing roles of the c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the mitochondrial cell death in response to ionizing radiation in human cervical cancer cells. Ionizing radiation triggered Bax and Bak activation, Bcl-2 down-regulation, and subsequent mitochondrial cell death. Inhibition of JNK completely suppressed radiation-induced Bax and Bak activation and Bcl-2 down-regulation. Dominant-negative forms of stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (SEK-1)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4 (MKK-4) inhibited JNK activation. Radiation also induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation. Interestingly, inhibition of PI3K effectively attenuated radiation-induced mitochondrial cell death and increased clonogenic survival. Inhibition of PI3K also suppressed SEK-1/MKK-4 and JNK activation, Bax and Bak activation, and Bcl-2 down-regulation. In contrast, inhibition of p38 MAPK led to enhanced Bax and Bak activation and mitochondrial cell death. RacN17, a dominant-negative form of Rac1, inhibited p38 MAPK activation and increased Bax and Bak activation. Exposure of cells to radiation also induced selective activation of c-Src among Src family kinases. Inhibition of c-Src by pretreatment with Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 or small interfering RNA targeting of c-Src attenuated radiation-induced p38 MAPK and Rac1 activation and enhanced Bax and Bak activation and cell death. Our results support the notion that the PI3K-SEK-1/MKK-4-JNK pathway is required for the mitochondrial cell death in response to radiation, whereas the c-Src-Rac1-p38 MAPK pathway plays a cytoprotective role against mitochondrial cell death.","title":"Opposing roles of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in the cellular response to ionizing radiation in human cervical cancer cells.","pubmedId":"19010820"}
