The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the addition of preoperative radiation therapy (XRT) to radical resection for RP-LPS at a single institution was associated with improved LR.\nThis retrospective analysis included patients with unifocal, primary RP-LPS who underwent complete R0/R1 resection at a single institution between 1991 and 2013. Multiple patient, tumor, and surgeon characteristics were tested to evaluate their association to LR (recurrence in the retroperitoneal space). We used competing risk hazards regression to evaluate the effect of preoperative XRT on the probability of LR.\nThere were 41 patients with liposarcoma histology whose tumors included entirely well-differentiated (N \u003d 13), de-differentiated components (n \u003d 26), myxoid (n \u003d 1), and NOS (n \u003d 1). Preoperative XRT was significantly associated with a lower probability of LR (HR 0.11, 95%CI 0.01-0.91, P \u003d 0.04) and a higher 5-year local recurrence-free survival (95.6%, 95%CI 72.4-99.4%, vs. 75.0%, 95%CI 40.8-91.2%; P \u003d 0.0213), but not with 5-year distant recurrence-free survival or disease-specific survival.\nPreoperative XRT combined with complete R0/R1 resection for unifocal, primary RP-LPS was associated with improved LR and it should be considered in the multimodality treatment of RP-LPS.
