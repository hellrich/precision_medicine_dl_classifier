So far, CD271 is one of the most specific markers for bone marrow (BM)-derived MSC. In search of additional markers, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with specificity for immature cells were screened by flow cytometry for their specific reactivity with the rare CD271(+) population. The recognized CD271(+) populations were fractionated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and the clonogenic capacity of the sorted cells was analyzed for their ability to give rise to CFU-F. The results showed that only the CD271(bright) but not the CD271(dim) population contained CFU-F. Two-color flow cytometry analysis revealed that only the CD271(bright) population was positive for the established MSC markers CD10, CD13, CD73, and CD105. In addition, a variety of mAbs specific for novel and partially unknown antigens selectively recognized the CD271(bright) population but no other BM cells. The new MSC-specific molecules included the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (CD140b), HER-2/erbB2 (CD340), frizzled-9 (CD349), the recently described W8B2 antigen, as well as cell-surface antigens defined by the antibodies W1C3, W3D5, W4A5, W5C4, W5C5, W7C6, 9A3, 58B1, F9-3C2F1, and HEK-3D6. In conclusion, the described markers are suitable for the prospective isolation of highly purified BM-MSC. These MSC may be used as an improved starting population for transplantation in diseases like osteogenesis imperfecta, cartilage repair, and myocardial infarction.","title":"Novel markers for the prospective isolation of human MSC.","pubmedId":"17395729"}
