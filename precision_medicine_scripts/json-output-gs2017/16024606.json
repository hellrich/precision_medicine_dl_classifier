We evaluated a large population-based sample of individuals with colon cancer to determine its relationship to survival and other clinicopathologic variables. The V600E BRAF mutation was seen in 5% (40 of 803) of microsatellite-stable tumors and 51.8% (43 of 83) of microsatellite-unstable tumors. In microsatellite-stable tumors, this mutation was related to poor survival, CIMP high, advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, and family history of colorectal cancer [odds ratio, 4.23; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.65-10.84]. The poor survival was observed in a univariate analysis of 5-year survival (16.7% versus 60.0%; P \u003c 0.01); in an analysis adjusted for age, stage, and tumor site [hazard rate ratio (HRR), 2.97; 95% CI, 2.05-4.32]; in stage-specific, age-adjusted analyses for AJCC stages 2 to 4 (HRR, 4.88, 3.60, and 2.04, respectively); and in Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for AJCC stages 2 to 4 (P \u003c 0.01 for all three stages). Microsatellite-unstable tumors were associated with an excellent 5-year survival whether the V600E mutation was present or absent (76.2% and 75.0%, respectively). We conclude that the BRAF V600E mutation in microsatellite-stable colon cancer is associated with a significantly poorer survival in stages 2 to 4 colon cancer but has no effect on the excellent prognosis of microsatellite-unstable tumors.","title":"Poor survival associated with the BRAF V600E mutation in microsatellite-stable colon cancers.","pubmedId":"16024606"}
