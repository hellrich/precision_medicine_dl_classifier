We explored the efficacy and survival of Gefitinib for young patients with unknown epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation of advanced lung adenocarcinoma.\nThe clinical data of 55 young patients with unknown EGFR gene mutation in advanced lung adenocarcinoma referred to the Cancer Hospital \u0026 Institute, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from Jan 2006 through Dec 2010 were analyzed retrospectively.\nOf 55 young patients enrolled, the median age was 41 years. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 43.6% and 90.9%, respectively.. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.0 months. Among the factors analyzed, brain metastasis had significant effect on PFS (P\u003d0.017). The median overall survival (OS) was 24.0 months. The independent prognostic factors to significantly improve OS included non-smoking history (P\u003d0.028) and receiving other anti-cancer treatment after Gefitinib therapy (P\u003c0.001).\nThe median PFS and OS of the young patients with Unknown EGFR gene mutation in advanced lung adenocarcinoma were similar with general population.\n背景与目的 肺癌在青年患者中发病率较低，本研究旨在探讨吉非替尼治疗表皮生长因子受体酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）基因突变状态不明青年晚期肺腺癌患者的疗效及生存情况的影响因素。方法 对2006年1月-2010年12月在中国医学科学院肿瘤医院接受吉非替尼治疗的55例EGFR基因突变状态不明的青年晚期肺腺癌患者的临床资料进行回顾性分析。结果 全组55例患者中位年龄41岁，吉非替尼治疗的客观有效率为43.6%，疾病控制率为90.9%。中位无进展生存期为9.0个月，是否存在脑转移对无进展生存期有明显影响（P\u003d0.017）。中位总生存期为24.0个月，无吸烟史（P\u003d0.028）及进展后是否接受后续治疗（P\u003c0.001）是明显改善总生存期的独立预后因素。结论 EGFR基因突变状态不明的青年晚期肺腺癌患者接受吉非替尼治疗与非年龄选择人群相比疗效相似。","title":"[Efficacy of gefitinib for young patients with unknown EGFR gene mutation \u2029in advanced lung adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"24854557"}
