Each patient underwent a 20-min pad test and urodynamic study prior to and 3 months after radical hysterectomy. ANOVA, Bonferroni test and paired t -test were utilized for analysis. The mean age of the 20 patients was 50.2+/-8.7 years with a mean parity of 3.5+/-1.5. Four (20%) of the 20 cases revealed normal urodynamic findings preoperatively, and the urodynamic findings became abnormal after surgery. Comparing the urodynamic parameters of both bladder voiding and storage functions pre- and post-surgery, we found significant impairments postoperatively in all 20 cases. Our data demonstrate that abnormal urodynamic findings may pre-exist for some patients with cervical cancer prior to surgical treatment. These findings may worsen, and/or additional abnormal states may arise subsequent to radical hysterectomy.","title":"Impact of radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer on urodynamic findings.","pubmedId":"15549261"}
