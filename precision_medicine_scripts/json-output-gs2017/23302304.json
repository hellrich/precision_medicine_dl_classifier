There were 29(24.2%) patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion, 14 (11.7%) patients with EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation and one (0.8%) with EGFR exon 21 L861Q mutation in the patients. All the mutations were single point mutations, and no multiple points mutations detected. EGFR mutation rate of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and adenocarcinoma were higher than that of non-adenocarcinoma (P \u003d 0.009). EGFR mutation rate was higher in female patients or patients without smoking history than male patients or patients with smoking history (P \u003d 0.014, P \u003d 0.001, respectively) in NSCLC patients. EGFR mutation rate was higher in patients without smoking history or patients with well-differentiated carcinoma than patients with smoking history or patients with moderately-and poorly-differentiated carcinoma (P \u003d 0.008, P \u003d 0.018, respectively). There was no difference in prognosis and EGFR-TKI treatment response rate between EGFR mutation patients and EGFR wild-type patients. Nine (8.7%) patients with KRAS mutation were detected in 104 NSCLC patients. There were four types of KRAS gene mutations detected: KRAS Gly12Ala (GGT \u003e GCT), KRAS Gly12Arg (GGT \u003e CGT), KRAS Gly12Val (GGT \u003e GTT) and KRAS Gly12Cys (GGT \u003e TGT). There were 4 patients with Cys mutation, 2 with Arg mutation, 2 with Val mutation and 1 with multiple points mutation of both Cys and Arg in exon 12. No relationship was found between KRAS mutation and clinicopathological feature either in NSCLC or in adenocarcinoma. Prognosis was worse in patients with KRAS mutation than in wild-type patients (P \u003d 0.008). No patient with both EGFR and KRAS mutation was detected.\nEGFR mutation rate is related with gender, smoking history and pathological type in NSCLC patients, and is also related with differentiation and smoking history in adenocarcinoma patients. And prognosis is worse in patients with KRAS mutation than that with wild type.","title":"[Relationship between EGFR and KRAS mutations and prognosis in Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a mutation analysis with real-time polymerase chain reaction using scorpion amplification refractory mutation system].","pubmedId":"23302304"}
