It was reported that EGFR mutations were more sensitive to EGFRTKI than those without the mutations among lung cancer patients. A subgroup of patients of Asian origin, female sex, adenocarcinoma, and no history of smoking were significantly associated with a high rate of EGFR mutations. These patients with EGFR mutations were not only favorable responders but also had a longer survival than without. In this article, we discuss the EGFR-TKI predictive factors by EGFR mutations.","title":"[Prediction of effectiveness of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the patients with by EGFR mutations].","pubmedId":"17431338"}
