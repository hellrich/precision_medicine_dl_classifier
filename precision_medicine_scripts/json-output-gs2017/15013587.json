After three cycles of cisplatin/etoposide patients receive either hyperfractionated radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent carboplatin/vindesine and then surgery (arm A) versus surgery and then conventional RT (arm B). Quality of life (QL) was assessed throughout therapy using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC 13. Of 126 eligible patients, 54 completed treatment. For patients in both treatment arms physical functioning decreased, whereas dyspnoea, fatigue and pain increased from beginning to the end of treatment. For self-assessed QL no statistically significant effect was found in or between the two treatment arms. The combined modality approach with preoperative radio/chemotherapy proves to be feasible in treating locally advanced NSCLC patients without decreasing their subjective QL.","title":"Combined modality treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: preoperative chemoradiation does not result in a poorer quality of life.","pubmedId":"15013587"}
