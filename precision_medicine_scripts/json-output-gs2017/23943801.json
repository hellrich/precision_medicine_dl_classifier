In this study, proteomic analyses reveal that coculture with tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF) induces significant overexpression of FGFR4, but not other FGFRs, in colorectal cancer cell lines. Mechanistic study shows that FGFR4 plays crucial roles in TAF-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer cell lines. Accumulated FGFR4 in cell membrane phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus. Further, TAF-derived CCL2 and its downstream transcription factor, Ets-1, are prerequisites for TAF-induced FGFR4 upregulation. Furthermore, FGFR4-associated pathways are shown to be preferentially activated in colorectal tumor samples, and direct tumor metastasis in a mouse metastasis model. Our study shows a pivotal role of FGFR4 in tumor-stroma interactions during colorectal cancer metastasis, and suggests novel therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of colorectal cancer.","title":"FGFR4 promotes stroma-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"23943801"}
