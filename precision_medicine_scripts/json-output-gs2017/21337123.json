In order to arrive at better control, prevention, diagnosis, and therapeutics for lung cancer, we must be able to personalize the approach towards the disease. Mind-mapping has existed for centuries for physicians to properly think about various \"flows\" of personalized medicine. We include here the epidemiology, diagnosis, histology, and treatment of lung cancer-in particular, non-small cell lung cancer. As we have new molecular signatures for lung cancer, this is further detailed. This review is not meant to be a comprehensive review, but rather its purpose is to highlight important aspects of lung cancer diagnosis, management, and personalized treatment options.","title":"Mind-mapping for lung cancer: towards a personalized therapeutics approach.","pubmedId":"21337123"}
