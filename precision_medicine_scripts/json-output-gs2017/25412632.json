In recent years, its prognosis has improved because of wider resections and the establishment of local treatment and chemotherapy in the palliative situation.\nThis review is based on pertinent articles that were retrieved by a selective literature search in the PubMed database with the keywords \"cholangiocarcinoma AND diagnostic OR therapy.\" Articles in English or German published up to January 2014 were considered.\nThe sole curative treatment for CCA is surgery, but 40-85% of all patients have recurrent disease even after radical excision. Because of this high recurrence rate, adjuvant treatments are now under intense discussion. For unresectable CCA without distant metastases, small case series have shown that liver transplantation can yield promising survival rates of over 50% at 5 years. For many patients with CCA, however, only palliative treatments can be offered, including endoscopic clearing of the biliary pathways. Because of the low prevalence of the disease, there have been only a few phase 3 studies of palliative chemotherapy for CCA. On the basis of one positive phase 3 study, chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin is considered the standard and now plays an established role in palliative care.\nCCA presents a special challenge in gastroenterology, oncology, and visceral surgery because of the difficulty in establishing the diagnosis, local complications in the biliary pathways, and a high recurrence rate after resection. Future studies should address not only the role of adjuvant chemotherapy, but also the efficacy of combined local and systemic treatment.","title":"The diagnosis and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25412632"}
