These tumors occur most commonly in the first decade of life, and have a particular radiological, histological and evolution features. We report a case of a PNET in an 8-year-old boy who presented intracranial hypertension studied with computed tomography scan, which demonstrated a sharply circumscribed expansive mass in the frontoparietal deep white matter, with a large cystic component, which was considered at first as a glial tumor. It was treated by total excision, and the histologic study demonstrated a medulloepithelioma. We studied the concept of PNET and their pathological, radiological and prognostic features.","title":"[A rare primitive neuroectodermal tumor: the medulloepithelioma].","pubmedId":"11104970"}
