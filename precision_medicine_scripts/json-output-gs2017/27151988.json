Archived pathologic samples from the patient\u0027s primary breast cancer were retested to confirm HER2-negative disease. Patients with confirmed HER2-negative primary breast cancer underwent 89Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT to screen for 89Zr-trastuzumab metastases. Metastases avid for 89Zr-trastuzumab by PET/CT were biopsied and pathologically examined to define HER2 status. Patients with pathologically proven HER2-positive metastases subsequently received off-protocol HER2-targeted therapy to evaluate treatment response.\nNine patients were enrolled, all of whom had pathologic retesting that confirmed HER2-negative primary breast cancer. Five demonstrated suggestive foci on 89Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT. Of these 5 patients, 2 had biopsy-proven HER2-positive metastases and went on to benefit from HER2-targeted therapy. In the other 3 patients, biopsy showed no evidence of HER2-positive disease, and their foci on 89Zr-trastuzumab PET were considered false-positive.\nIn this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that 89Zr-trastuzmab PET/CT detects unsuspected HER2-positive metastases in patients with HER2-negative primary breast cancer. Although these are only initial results in a small sample, they are a proof of the concept that HER2-targeted imaging can identify additional candidates for HER2-targeted therapy. More specific HER2-targeted agents will be needed for clinical use.","title":"Detection of HER2-Positive Metastases in Patients with HER2-Negative Primary Breast Cancer Using 89Zr-Trastuzumab PET/CT.","pubmedId":"27151988"}
