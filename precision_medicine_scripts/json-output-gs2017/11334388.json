Recent reports have shown the existence of gain-of-function mutations in the juxta-membrane domain of receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) in GISTs. We present a 77-year-old woman with GIST diagnosed by positive immunostaining of cluster designation (CD) 34 and KIT. This case had a novel mutation at codon 576 located in the juxta-membrane domain of KIT. Our results indicate the importance of mutations in this KIT region and suggest the possibility of the existence of other types of mutations in this region in GISTs.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor with a novel mutation of KIT proto-oncogene.","pubmedId":"11334388"}
