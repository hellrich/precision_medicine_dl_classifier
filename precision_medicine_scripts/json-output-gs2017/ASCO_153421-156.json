We recently identified that major subsets of KRAS-mutant LUAC defined on the basis of co-occurring genomic alterations in STK11/LKB1, TP53 and CDKN2A/B display distinct immune profiles. Specifically, inactivation of the LKB1 tumor suppressor is associated with striking lack of immune system engagement. Here, we systematically assess the immune contexture of LUACs in the context of LKB1 inactivation. Methods:    Our datasets include 431 LUACs from TCGA with available exome sequence and RNA-Seq data, as well as a cohort of 106 early stage tumors collected at MDACC (PROSPECT dataset) with available mRNA (Illumina), phospho-protein (RPPA) expression and quantitative IHC data. The un-paired t test and Wilcoxons rank-sum test were used for comparisons of mean mRNA expression and Histo-scores respectively. PROSPECT tumors were dichotomized into LKB1-low and LKB1-high based on LKB1 protein expression. Results:    Somatic mutation of LKB1 was associated with wide suppression of cytolytic T cell responses. This included apparent defects in MHC class I and II antigen presentation pathways [HLA-A (P \u003d 0.057), HLA-B (P \u003d 1.55e-06), HLA-C (P \u003d 1.28e-05), B2M (P \u003d 1.8e-03), HLA-DMA (P \u003d 2.8e-04), HLA-DMB (P \u003d 6.08e-07),HLA-DOA (P \u003d 6.28e-07), HLA-DOB (P \u003d 3.5e-04) ] as well as reduced expression of co-stimulatory [CD28 (P \u003d 3.9e-03), CD80 (P \u003d 5.55e-07), CD86 (P \u003d 6.79e-06),CD40 (P \u003d 5.09e-09), CD70 (P \u003d 5.7e-04), TNFRSF9 (P \u003d 3.79e-05), TNFSF9 (P \u003d 0.007), ICOS (P \u003d 3.3e-03),ICOSLG (P \u003d 1.2e-03)] and co-inhibitory [CTLA (P \u003d 0.034), PDCD1 (P \u003d 0.0125), CD274 (P \u003d 1.16e-08), PDCD1LG2 (P \u003d 8.66e-06), LAG3 (P \u003d 0.023), LGALS9 (P \u003d 1.65e-05)] molecules. A number of these were further validated in PROSPECT. In the context of KRAS-mutant LUACs, LKB1 inactivation was associated with a lower PD-L1 IHC score (P \u003d 0.039) and reduced populations of CD3+, CD8+ and CD45RO+ lymphocytes. Detailed IHC data will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions:    LKB1 inactivation is associated with a muted tumor immune phenotype and may thus predict for resistance to immunotherapy approaches that incorporate immune checkpoint blockade.","title":"Association of inactivation of STK11/ LKB1 with a suppressive immune microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_153421-156"}
