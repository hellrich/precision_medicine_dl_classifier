However, KRAS mutation as a prognostic factor of survival outcome remains controversial in CRC, independent of anti-EGFR therapies.\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 103 CRC patients who were available for evaluation of KRAS mutation status. None of the patients analyzed had received anti-EGFR therapies. The role of KRAS mutation status was evaluated as a predictive factor for oxaliplatin or irinotecan and as a prognostic factor in CRC patients who did not receive anti-EGFR therapies.\nMutations in KRAS were observed in 48.5% of patients. The response for oxaliplatin- (p\u003d0.664) and irinotecan-based (p\u003d0.255) cytotoxic chemotherapy did not differ according to the KRAS mutation status. In addition, no significant difference in progression free survival (PFS; oxaliplatin, p\u003d0.583 and irinotecan, p\u003d0.426) and overall survival (OS; p\u003d0.258) was observed between the wild and mutant type of the KRAS gene. In univariate and multivariate analyses, KRAS mutations did not have a major prognostic value regarding PFS (oxaliplatin: hazard ratio, 0.892; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.590 to 1.347; p\u003d0.586 and irinotecan: hazard ratio, 0.831; 95% CI, 0.524 to 1.319; p\u003d0.433) or OS (hazard ratio, 0.754; 95% CI, 0.460 to 1.236; p\u003d0.263). In addition, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies did not affect PFS to oxaliplatin or irinotecan and OS.\nKRAS mutation is not a prognostic marker for PFS to oxaliplatin or irinotecan and OS in CRC patients who did not receive anti-EGFR therapies.","title":"Impact of KRAS Mutation Status on Outcomes in Metastatic Colon Cancer Patients without Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Therapy.","pubmedId":"23613671"}
