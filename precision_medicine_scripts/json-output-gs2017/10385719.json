Among the other 43 patients EUS revealed signs of unresectability in 20 additional patients who then underwent palliative surgical or medical treatment (median survival time 7 to 8 months). Twenty-three carcinomas were considered resectable according to EUS findings: Palliative surgery was performed in 9 cases (survival time 6 months), and 14 tumors could be resected in a curative way with a median survival period of 15 (pancreatic) to 16 months (ampullary). In evaluation of resectability, EUS had a 50% sensitivity (positive examination), 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, 61% negative predictive value, and 72% accuracy.\nEUS is accurate for evaluating resectability of ampullary and pancreatic cancer. EUS staging can prevent unnecessary surgery, and the findings correlate well with prognosis. The management of ampullary and pancreatic cancer could be improved with EUS.","title":"Role of EUS in the management of pancreatic and ampullary carcinoma: a prospective study assessing resectability and prognosis.","pubmedId":"10385719"}
