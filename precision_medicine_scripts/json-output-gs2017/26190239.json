The average duration of BRAF inhibition before lesion excision was 8Â months. Frequently associated histologic features included pigmentation of the stratum corneum, hyperpigmented keratinocytes, dermal melanophages, and deep HMB-45 expression. The lesions were BRAFV600E and neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog wild-type, expressed diffuse weak-moderate pERK, and possessed a predominance of CD8(+) in comparison with CD4(+) T lymphocytes within the dermal infiltrates.\nThis is a retrospective study of a small and heterogeneous group.\nThe nevi associated with BRAF inhibitor therapy invariably lack BRAFV600E mutation. BRAF inhibition appears to cause an increased cytotoxic T-cell response and increased mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in BRAF wild-type lesions, supported by pERK expression, possibly resulting in an activated phenotype characterized by increased melanin pigmentation and deep HMB-45 expression.","title":"Melanocytic nevi excised during B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) inhibitor therapy: A study of 19 lesions from 10 patients.","pubmedId":"26190239"}
