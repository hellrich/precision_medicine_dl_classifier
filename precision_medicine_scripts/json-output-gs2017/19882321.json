A 68-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a tumor close to the head of the pancreas. Imaging studies revealed submucosal tumors of the duodenum. The retroperitoneal tumor was diagnosed before surgery. Besides the main tumor in the duodenum, multiple small submucosal tumors were found in the duodenum and upper part of the jejunum during the operation. All of these tumors were resected. The histological diagnosis of all these tumors was GISTs. These tumors were immunohistochemically positive for KIT, but they demonstrated no mutation in c-kit exons 9, 11, 13, and 17, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha exons 12 and 18. No recurrence occurred for a year after surgery.","title":"Multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumors in neurofibromatosis type 1: report of a case.","pubmedId":"19882321"}
