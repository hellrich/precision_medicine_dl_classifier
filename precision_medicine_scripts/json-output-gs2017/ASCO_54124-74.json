Cix, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets IGF-IR with high affinity and antagonizes IGF-I and IGF-II ligand binding and signaling. It inhibits the IGF-IR pathway by effecting internalization and degradation of IGF-IR. In vitro and in vivo, cix inhibits proliferation of a variety of human tumor cell lines (Cancer Res. 2003;63:8912; Clin Cancer Res. 2005;11:3065). Temsirolimus inhibits mTOR, (Oncogene 2007;26:1932) and has been shown to inhibit growth of histologically diverse tumor cells. Since activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTor signaling is associated with negative feedback on IGF-1R and other upstream pathways, it is hypothesized that relief of this negative feedback with a rapamycin-analog may paradoxically activate IGF/AKT signaling, thus attenuating antitumor effects. Inhibition using an IGF-1R antibody in addition to mTOR inhibition may restore antitumor activity (Cancer Res 2006;66:1500). Prostate cancer, despite a high frequency of PTEN loss (\u003e50%) and AKT/mTOR signaling, is relatively insensitive to single agent mTOR inhibition and is an ideal setting to test an IGF-1R antibody in combination with mTOR inhibition. Methods: The starting dose of cix [6 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.)] and tem (25 mg i.v.) is based on phase I studies of the combination in advanced solid tumors. If not tolerated in the first 6 patients with CRPC, the dosage will be systematically decreased. The primary endpoint is tumor response rate and/or composite time to progression in 20 patients. If predetermined efficacy criteria based on reported results with cix alone in CRPC (J Clin Oncol 27:15s, 2009; abstr 5142) are met, the study will proceed to a randomized phase II study of cix alone vs cix with tem. Correlative studies include analysis of circulating tumor cells, FDG PET imaging, and optional FDHT PET and tumor biopsies. This study is a DOD/PCF PCCTC trial sponsored by CTEP.","title":"Anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-IR) monoclonal antibody cixutumumab plus mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor temsirolimus in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_54124-74"}
