A total of 69 LSTs, comprising 36 Gr-LSTs and 33 NGr-LSTs, were immunohistochemically stained with MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, CD10 (markers of gastrointestinal cell lineage), p53, β-catenin and Ki-67 antibodies, and examined for alteration in exon 1 of v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and exon 15 of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF) by polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing.\nHistologically, 15 Gr-LST samples were adenomas with low-grade dysplasia (LGD), 12 were high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and 9 were adenocarcinomas invading the submucosa (INV), while 12 NGr-LSTs demonstrated LGD, 14 HGD and 7 INV. In the proximal colon, MUC5AC expression was significantly higher in the Gr-type than the NGr-type. MUC6 was expressed only in NGr-LST. MUC2 or CD10 did not differ. P53 expression demonstrated a significant stepwise increment in progression through LGD-HGD-INV with both types of LST. Nuclear β-catenin expression was significantly higher in the NGr-type. Ki-67 expression was significantly higher in the Gr-type in the lower one third zone of the tumor. In proximal, but not distal colon tumors, the incidence of KRAS provided mutation was significantly higher in the Gr-type harboring a specific mutational pattern (G12V). BRAF mutations (V600E) were detected only in two Gr-LSTs.\nThe two subtypes of LST, especially in the proximal colon, have differing phenotypes of gastrointestinal cell lineage, proliferation and activation of Wnt/β-catenin or RAS/RAF/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling.","title":"MUC5AC/β-catenin expression and KRAS gene alteration in laterally spreading colorectal tumors.","pubmedId":"23112547"}
