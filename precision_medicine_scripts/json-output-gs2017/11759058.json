Their actions depend on binding to four specific receptors--FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4--whose distribution in normal endocrine cells and related tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) system has previously been examined. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal tissues and 60 well-characterized GEP endocrine tumors were immunostained using specific antibodies directed against various GEP hormones, aFGF, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. Acidic FGF immunoreactivity (IR) was found in gut EC cells; FGFR1 immunoreactivity in rare duodenal endocrine cells and in pancreatic A cells; FGFR2 immunoreactivity in gastric and duodenal G cells, pancreatic B cells, and rectal EC cells; FGFR3 immunoreactivity in duodenal G cells; and FGFR4 immunoreactivity in rectal L cells and in pancreatic B, PP, and A cells. Immunoreactivity for at least one of the four FGFRs was found in all tumors, independently of FGFR expression in the putative cell of origin. EC cell tumors, which were all positive for aFGF, were found to express at least three different FGFRs. FGFRs also were localized in the stromal cells of all the tumors examined. The tumor stroma was more abundant in EC cell tumors than in other types of neoplasms. The results suggest that aFGF-FGFR interaction may be involved in the modulation of normal endocrine cell functions and in the regulation of tumor growth and stromal proliferation of EC cell carcinoids.","title":"Immunohistochemical detection of fibroblast growth factor receptors in normal endocrine cells and related tumors of the digestive system.","pubmedId":"11759058"}
