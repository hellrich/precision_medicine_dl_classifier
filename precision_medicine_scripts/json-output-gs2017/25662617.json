Previous research has revealed that STK33 expression plays a special role in cancer cell proliferation. However, the mechanisms of STK33 induction of cancer cells remain largely unknown. In this study, it is demonstrated that STK33 expression varies in NL9980 and L9981 cells which are homogeneous cell lines with similar genetic backgrounds. STK33 can promote cell migration and invasion and suppress p53 gene expression in the NL9980 and L9981 cells. In addition, this protein also promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, STK33 knockdown decreases tumor-related gene expression and inhibits cell migration, invasion, and EMT, suggesting that STK33 may be a mediator of signaling pathways that are involved in cancer. In conclusion, our results suggest that STK33 may be an important prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for the metastatic progression of human lung cancer.
