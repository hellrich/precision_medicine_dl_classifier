These findings suggest a close and/or synergistic nature in the relationship between the two disease processes; however, no prospective data exist on the incidence rate of hypertension in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nThe present study assessed the risk of developing hypertension in 840 postmenopausal women: 102 women (12.1% of the cohort) with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 738 (87.9%) free of diabetes. The mean +/- SD follow-up was 3.2 +/- 0.9 years (range 0.5-6.0 years).\nThe incidence rate (cases of hypertension per 100 person-years) was 1.1 for the group of women without diabetes versus 5.6 in women with diabetes (P \u003c 0.0001). Compared with the non-diabetic group, women with type 2 diabetes mellitus had a statistically significant higher risk of developing hypertension. The relative risks for women with diabetes was 5.09 [crude: 95% confidence interval (CI) \u003d 3.52-7.36; P \u003c 0.0001]; 3.43 (adjusted for body mass index and waist circumference: 95% CI \u003d 2.25-5.14; P \u003c 0.001); and 2.95 (adjusted for all potential confounders: 95% CI \u003d 1.86-4.32; P \u003c 0.01).\nIn our prospective study, on the incidence of hypertension, the presence of type 2 diabetes was found to be a potent independent risk determinant. This suggests that postmenopausal women affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus comprise a population at high risk for the subsequent development of hypertension.","title":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the development of hypertension in postmenopausal women.","pubmedId":"16957562"}
