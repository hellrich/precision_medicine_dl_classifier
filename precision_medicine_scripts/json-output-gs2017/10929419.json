We report on an example of microcystic meningioma arising in the skull of an elderly woman. Radiological examination revealed a localized osteolytic lesion in the left parietal bone. At surgery, it was discovered that the tumor was located within the skull without any evidence of extraosseous extension. The light microscopic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features were consistent with a microcystic variant of meningioma. To our knowledge, this is the first case of an intraosseous microcystic meningioma, and we believe that this type of meningioma should be considered in the differential diagnoses of myxoid bone tumors of the calvarium.","title":"Intraosseous microcystic meningioma.","pubmedId":"10929419"}
