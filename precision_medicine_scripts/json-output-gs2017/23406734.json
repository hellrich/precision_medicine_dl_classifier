T2DM is significantly associated with the increased risk of PLC in both men [hazard ratio (HR) \u003d 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-2.51] and women (HR \u003d 1.64, 95% CI 1.03-2.61). The highest risk of incident liver cancer was observed in the first 5 years after diabetes diagnosis, and decreased substantially with the prolonged diabetes duration (P(trend) \u003c 0.001). No synergistic interaction in the development of PLC was found between diabetes and other known risk factors.\nT2DM is associated with the increased risk of subsequent liver cancer within 5 years after diagnosis in Chinese population, suggesting that hyperinsulinaemia rather than hyperglycaemia is more likely to be a primary mediator for this association.","title":"Prospective evaluation of type 2 diabetes mellitus on the risk of primary liver cancer in Chinese men and women.","pubmedId":"23406734"}
