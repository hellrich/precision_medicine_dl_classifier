A high frequency of allelic loss at the BRCA2 gene locus has also been reported in a variety of sporadic epithelial tumors including oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and sporadic head and neck SCC.\nThe present study aimed to examine the integrity of the BRCA2 gene in cutaneous SCC.\nAllelic imbalance/loss of heterozygosity (AI/LOH) was examined in 22 histologically confirmed cutaneous SCC at two microsatellite markers, D13S260 (centromeric to the BRCA2 gene) and D13S267 (telomeric to the BRCA2 gene). Immunohistochemical analysis of BRCA2 protein expression was also examined in the cutaneous SCC.\nAI/LOH at the D13S260 locus was found in eight of the 19 informative SCC, and AI/LOH at the D13S267 locus was found in 12 of the 18 informative SCC. Seven SCC showed allelic loss at both markers, and six SCC showed retention of heterozygosity at both markers. Expression of BRCA2 protein was only detected in six of the normal epidermises and three of the 21 SCC examined.\nAI/LOH of the BRCA2 gene region was found to be common in the cutaneous SCC.","title":"Molecular genetic analysis of the BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene region in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas.","pubmedId":"18095987"}
