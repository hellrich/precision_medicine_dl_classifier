In addition, immunohistochemistry was done to detect CEA in colon cancers.\nThe mRNA expression of HCCR-1 in colon cancers was higher than that in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P \u003c 0.05), and the mRNA expression of HCCR-1 in adjacent non-cancerous tissues was higher than that in normal tissues (P \u003c 0.05). The positive rate of HCCR-1 in colon cancers was 80.9%, which was higher than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P \u003c 0.05). Almost no HCCR-1 expression was observed in normal tissues, weak expression in adjacent non-cancerous tissues and strong expression in colon cancers. The positive rate of HCCR-1 in colon cancer at Duke stage B-C was 87.3%, which was higher than that in stage A colon cancer (63.6%, P \u003c 0.05).\nHCCR-1 is over-expressed in colon cancers, indicating that HCCR-1 may participate in occurrence and development of colon cancer and has a correlation with the pathological progress of colon cancer progression.","title":"Human cervical cancer oncogene-1 over expression in colon cancer and its clinical significance.","pubmedId":"25785079"}
