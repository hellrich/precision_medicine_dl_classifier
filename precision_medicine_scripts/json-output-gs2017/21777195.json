Although it has critical physiological functions in embryonic development and tissue repair, this signaling cascade is frequently deregulated in a wide range of tumors. Aberrant HGF/c-MET signaling, driven by various mechanisms, including constitutive activation and over-expression, has multifunctional effects in oncogenesis and is implicated in the acquisition of an aggressive phenotype with metastatic potential. The central role of c-MET activity in cancer progression, as well as disparities between quiescent HGF/c-MET signaling in normal tissue and overexpression in tumor may provide a degree of tumor selectivity for therapeutic intervention, making HGF or c-MET inhibition an attractive proposition in oncology. This review focuses on the underlying oncogenic role of aberrant HGF/c-MET signaling in malignant progression, as well as recent preclinical and clinical data on the different strategies employed in inhibiting HGF/c-MET function.","title":"HGF/c-MET targeted therapeutics: novel strategies for cancer medicine.","pubmedId":"21777195"}
