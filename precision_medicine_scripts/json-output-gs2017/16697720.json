Different mutations are reportedly associated with distinctive phenotypes and possibly clinical behavior. We investigated the correlation among mutation type, phenotype, and clinical course in a preimatinib, population-based series of GIST with long-term follow-up.\nGenomic DNA from 177 GIST patients was analyzed for KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18 mutations using denaturating high-performance liquid chromatography and bidirectional sequencing.\nKIT exon 11 mutations were detected in 101 of 177 GIST (61 deletions, 23 missense mutations, and 17 duplications); wild-type (WT) KIT and PDGFRA were detected in 63; KIT exon 9 and exon 17 mutations in 6 and 1, respectively; and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18 mutations in 3 each. GIST \u003e5 cm vs GIST \u003c/\u003d1 cm had mutations in 73% and 33%, respectively. KIT exon 11 deletions were significantly associated with a higher proportion of high risk or overtly malignant groups compared with WT GIST. KIT exon 11 deletions adversely affected outcome. KIT exon 11 duplications and exon 9 mutations were found exclusively in gastric and small intestinal GIST, respectively.\nKIT exon 11 deletion is an independent adverse prognostic factor in patients with GIST.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors with KIT exon 11 deletions are associated with poor prognosis.","pubmedId":"16697720"}
