A total of 109 prospectively sampled cancer patients, receiving the first treatment with an EGFR inhibitor, were genotyped for functional EGFR polymorphisms and tagging variants in genes involved in receptor downstream signaling. Skin rash was absent in 26 (23.9%) patients and associated with shorter overall survival compared with patients presenting skin rash (P\u003d0.005). The EGFR polymorphisms, 497G/A (P\u003d0.008), and the haplotypes of the promoter variants, EGFR-216G/T and -191C/A (P\u003d0.029), were associated with the appearance of skin rash. In addition, a common haplotype in the PIK3CA gene was associated with skin rash (P\u003d0.045) and overall survival (P\u003d0.009). In conclusion, genetic variation within the EGFR gene and its downstream signaling partner PIK3CA might predict EGFR-inhibitor-related skin rash.","title":"Pharmacogenetic predictors for EGFR-inhibitor-associated skin toxicity.","pubmedId":"22158333"}
