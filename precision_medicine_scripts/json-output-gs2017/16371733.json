All patients were histologically diagnosed as having cholangiocarcinoma. The proximal resection margins were cancer-negative in 7 patients and cancer-positive in 1 patient. Four patients with multiple lymph node metastases died of cancer recurrence within 3 years after hepatectomy. One patient died of liver failure without recurrence 42 months after hepatectomy. The remaining 3 patients without lymph node metastasis are now alive after more than 5 years.\nAnatomic right hepatic trisectionectomy with caudate lobectomy can produce a longer proximal resection margin and can offer a better chance of long-term survival in some selected patients with advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"\"Anatomic\" right hepatic trisectionectomy (extended right hepatectomy) with caudate lobectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"16371733"}
