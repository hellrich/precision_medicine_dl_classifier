The aim of this study was to detect the expression of multidrug resistant gene 1 (MDR1) in pancreatic cancer cell lines.\nMDR1 mRNA and P-gp were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical assay (IHC) in three pancreatic cancer cell lines SW1990, CAPAN-1 and P3. P-gp functions were evaluated through the rhodamine extrusion test.\nTwo of the three cell lines expressed MDR1 positively at different levels. The rhodamine extrusion test showed that the percentage of positive cells in MDR(+) cells was significantly lower than that in MDR1(-) cells. The results of IHC, RT-PCR and the rhodamine extrusion test were consistent with each other.\nAll of these methods are reliable in the detection of MDR1 in pancreatic cancer tissue, thus providing a guide for clinical chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Detection of multidrug resistant gene 1 in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"15138133"}
