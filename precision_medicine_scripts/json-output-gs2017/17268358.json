The diagnostic approach is dictated by the concern not to overlook any metastatic sites. Small cell bronchial carcinoma is often metastatic at the time of diagnosis and should be considered an actual or potential systemic disease. Chemotherapy is therefore the basis of treatment. It should consist of at least a two drug regime combining cisplatin and etoposide. In extensive disease, that is when all the disease cannot be contained within one irradiation field, chemotherapy alone is recommended. In limited disease combined simultaneous radiotherapy and chemotherapy is recommended. Prophylactic cranial irradiation is indicated in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. The therapeutic armamentarium has recently been enlarged by the development of new antineoplastic drugs and the development of non-toxic targeted agents including those influencing angiogenesis. The understanding of the specific mechanisms of drug resistance and the study of the tumour phenotypes and genotypes will allow, in the future, the development of treatments adapted for each patient.","title":"[Small cell lung cancer (CPC).
