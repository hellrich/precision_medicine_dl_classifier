The aim of this study was to develop a novel and effective approach to knockdown FHL2, which can serve as a promising target of colon cancer therapy. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) was generated bearing with FHL2-shRNA and transfected into LoVo cells. Cell cycle and growth were assessed. The interaction between FHL2 and G0/G1 cell cycle and growth was evaluated by flow cytometry, western blot analysis and WST-1 assay. We showed that suppression of FHL2 by rAAV-shRNA induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibited cell growth. Apoptosis-related proteins and their activity was investigated at the same time. rAAV-FHL2‑shRNA activated intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways and increased cell susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli by 5-FU. Moreover, a xenograft model was established to explore rAAV-FHL2-shRNA with 5-FU mediated tumorigenesis in vivo. A strong anti-tumorigenic effect of rAAV-FHL2-shRNA was shown in nude mice and this antitumor effect was enhanced when combined with 5-FU treatment. These findings implicate FHL2 as a cell cycle and growth modulator and thus inhibit apoptosis in colon cancer cells. rAAV-shRNA-FHL2 may serve as a novel and potent therapeutic or 5-FU co-therapeutic agent for colon cancer.","title":"A novel colon cancer gene therapy using rAAV‑mediated expression of human shRNA-FHL2.","pubmedId":"24008552"}
