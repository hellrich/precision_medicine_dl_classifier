Among them, glandular lesions are the most common, but their properties are obscure. We report here a 53-year-old woman with PJS who developed multiple hamartomatous polyps in the jejunum and mucinous glandular lesions in multiple organ systems: glandular metaplasia in the urinary bladder; lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia in the uterine cervix; mucinous metaplasia in the right fallopian tube; mucinous adenoma in the left ovary. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses disclosed that all of the intestinal and extra-intestinal lesions were associated with pyloric gland metaplasia/differentiation across the organ systems. In the general population, the organs described above rarely or infrequently show pyloric gland phenotype, to say nothing of trans-organ involvement. It is strongly suggested that commitment to pyloric gland metaplasia/differentiation is closely associated with PJS.","title":"Pyloric gland metaplasia/differentiation in multiple organ systems in a patient with Peutz-Jegher\u0027s syndrome.","pubmedId":"21615613"}
