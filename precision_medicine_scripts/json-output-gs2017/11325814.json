Here we report two identical mutations in FGFR2 that cause craniosynostosis syndromes, Crouzon, Apert, and Pfeiffer in gastric carcinoma. A missense mutation (Ser267Pro) in exon IIIa and a splice site mutation (940-2A--\u003eG) in exon IIIc were detected in gastric cancer patients. Interestingly, these heterozygous somatic mutations are identical to the germinal activating mutations in FGFR2 reported previously in craniosynostosis syndromes. In addition, the two novel mutations of FGFR3 in colorectal carcinomas were identified. All identified mutations occurred at highly conserved sequences, not only in the FGFR family of molecules, but also throughout evolution and clustered in the immunoglobulin-like loop-III domain, highlighting the functional importance of this domain. Our results indicate that FGFR2 and FGFR3, in addition to their potential role in skeletal dysplasias, play an important role in tumorigenesis.","title":"Mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 genes associated with human gastric and colorectal cancers.","pubmedId":"11325814"}
