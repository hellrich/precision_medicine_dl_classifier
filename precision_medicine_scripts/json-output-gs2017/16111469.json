Until recently, chemotherapeutic treatment options were limited to various 5-fluorouracil-leucovorin combinations. However, the last 10 years have seen rapid developments in the treatment of colon cancer. These include the introduction of two additional chemotherapeutic agents, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Additional agents have been developed, namely the targeted therapies in the form of the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab and cetuximab. The oral forms of chemotherapy (i.e., capecitabine and uracil-tegafur) have been demonstrated to be as efficacious as traditional intravenously administered 5-fluorouracil. As a result, the number of possible treatment options available to patients has increased dramatically. The aim of this review is to report the currently accepted stage-specific chemotherapeutic treatment options for colon cancer, the evidence for these regimens and future developments.","title":"Current stage-specific chemotherapeutic options in colon cancer.","pubmedId":"16111469"}
