However, this has not been investigated for rare EGFR mutations or their impact on treatment response and outcome to EGFR TKIs (primary objective) and chemotherapy (secondary objective).\nIn an observational prospective cohort, we analyzed 188 NSCLC patients from Mexico, Colombia and Costa Rica with EGFR mutations. As a first line of treatment, 66.5% received platinum-based chemotherapy. All patients received TKIs in first-line treatment or after progression to chemotherapy. The clinical-pathological characteristics as well as the f of common and rare EGFR mutations associated with treatment response were analyzed.\nOf all patients, 79.5% had common and 20.5% had rare EGFR mutations. Lepidic and acinar adenocarcinomas were associated with common EGFR mutations (p\u003d0.010). Patients with common EGFR mutations had higher response rates to EGFR-TKIs than those who had rare EGFR mutations (63.8 vs 32.4%, p\u003c0.001). Women had increased progression-free survival (PFS) to EGFR-TKIs than men (16.4 vs 9.5 months, p\u003d0.02). The median PFS and overall survival (OS) were better in patients with common EGFR mutations (15.5 vs 3.9 months, p\u003c0.001; and 37.3 vs 17.4 months, p\u003c0.001) respectively.\nOur findings suggested that only patients with rare EGFR mutations could receive platinum-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment, due to their low response rates and short PFS in response to EGFR-TKIs. Consequently, EGFR-TKIs could be reserved as a second- or third-line treatment. In patients with EGFR mutations, women have better PFS to EGFR-TKIs than men, and rare EGFR mutations are more frequent in high grade adenocarcinomas than in low grade tumors.","title":"The impact of common and rare EGFR mutations in response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25558790"}
