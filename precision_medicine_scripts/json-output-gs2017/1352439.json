Amplification was detected in two cases. By applying the isochizomers Hpall and Mspl we tested for alterations in the DNA methylation status. Whereas in colon tumors with non-amplified erbB2 this status was unchanged, one case with erbB2 amplification showed additional MspI bands indicating a methylation of the amplified gene sequences. In stomach carcinoma, however, we detected differences between tumor and mucosa samples but not between amplified and non-amplified tumor samples. Independent of the DNA methylation status, significant amounts of the erbB2 oncoprotein were detected in the cases with gene amplification; weaker immunostaining of erbB2 was also seen in a few additional tumors.","title":"Tumor-specific methylation patterns of erbB2 (HER2/neu) sequences in gastro-intestinal cancer.","pubmedId":"1352439"}
