The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of KRAS and BRAF mutation in patients treated with adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX).\nKRAS exon 2 and BRAF codon 600 were analyzed in patients with stage II and III CRC who underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant FOLFOX. Clinicopathologic features and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared.\nAmong a total of 437 patients, mutational data of KRAS and BRAF were available in 388 and 433 patients, respectively. KRAS mutation (codon 12 and 13) and BRAF V600E mutation was found in 26.5 and 3.7 % of patients. DFS was significantly worse in the KRAS mutant patients compared to KRAS wild type patients (3-year DFS 79 and 92 %, p \u003d 0.006). Multivariate analysis revealed KRAS mutation as an independent negative prognostic factor for DFS (adjusted hazard ratio 2.30, 95 % confidence interval 1.23-4.32). Among the various subtypes of KRAS mutation, G13D (3-year DFS 76 %, p \u003d 0.008) was significantly associated with poor DFS, while G12D was not associated with prognosis (3-year DFS 86 %, p \u003d 0.61). There was no association between BRAF mutation and DFS.\nKRAS mutation has an adverse prognostic impact on stage II or III CRC treated with adjuvant FOLFOX.","title":"KRAS mutation is associated with worse prognosis in stage III or high-risk stage II colon cancer patients treated with adjuvant FOLFOX.","pubmedId":"24889488"}
