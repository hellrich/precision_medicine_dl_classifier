This therapy included extended pancreatic resection, intraoperative irradiation by 30 Gy of electrons, and intraoperative hepatic arterial or portal infusion of mitomycin C. Furthermore, postoperative chemotherapy with mitomycin C, using Seldinger\u0027s method or iv administration, was added. The study consisted of 13 patients with carcinoma of the pancreatic head and six patients with carcinoma of the body and tail. The one- and three-year survival rates for these patients were 88 and 50%, respectively. The five-year survival rate was calculated as 28%, although there is only one five-year survivor. The effectiveness of this therapy was studied by changes in Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level. Thirteen of the 15 patients with high CA19-9 levels showed a decrease to a level less than 50 U/mL after this therapy. In the postoperative course, the patients showing a tendency of elevation of the CA19-9 level could be suspected of having cancer recurrence at this time without any physical sign or other laboratory findings.","title":"Evidence of effective multidisciplinary treatment for resectable pancreatic cancer from the viewpoint of the CA19-9 level.","pubmedId":"1744441"}
