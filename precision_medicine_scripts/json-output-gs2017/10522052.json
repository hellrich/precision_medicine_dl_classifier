A 43 year-old man had pancreatic cancer with para-aortic lymph node metastases. He received FP therapy and achieved a partial response. After the initiation of chemotherapy, his symptoms such as severe pain and fatigue improved remarkably. Serum interleukin-6 levels correlated with these symptoms; the level was high before chemotherapy, but the levels were decreased during the courses of FP therapy. It is important to achieve symptomatic improvement in patients with pancreatic cancer, and serum interleukin-6 levels may be useful to evaluate a symptomatic response to chemotherapy.","title":"A case of pancreatic cancer achieving symptomatic improvement with systemic chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"10522052"}
