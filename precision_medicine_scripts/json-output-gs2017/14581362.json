The role of each tumor suppressor pathway in low-grade diffuse astrocytomas and their relationships with clinical behavior remain to be elucidated.\nWe assessed the alterations of the RB1/CDK4/p16(INK4a)/p15(INK4b) and the TP53/MDM2/p14(ARF) pathways in 46 WHO grade II astrocytomas and analyzed their impact on prognosis.\nThe TP53/MDM2/p14(ARF) pathway was altered in 32 of 46 cases (70%) by either TP53 mutation (25 cases) or p14(ARF) methylation (9 cases). The RB1/CDK4/p16(INK4a)/p15(INK4b) pathway was disrupted in 6 of 46 cases (13%) by either RB1 methylation (1 case), p16(INK4a) methylation (3 cases), or p15(INK4b) methylation or homozygous deletion (3 cases). Generally speaking, individual tumors thus tended to display alteration of only one component from both pathways. Any independently analyzed genetic alteration failed to provide statistically prognostic information. The alternate or simultaneous presence of TP53 mutation and p14(ARF) methylation emerged as a univariate predictor of a shorter progression-free survival (P \u003d 0.0456) but was not statistically significant when age and extent of surgery were included in the analysis.\nAlternative disruption of the TP53/p14(ARF) pathway represents a frequent event in low-grade diffuse astrocytomas and correlates with an unfavorable clinical course. However, its value is unlikely to include prognostic utility that is independent of other conventional prognostic factors.","title":"Deregulation of the TP53/p14ARF tumor suppressor pathway in low-grade diffuse astrocytomas and its influence on clinical course.","pubmedId":"14581362"}
