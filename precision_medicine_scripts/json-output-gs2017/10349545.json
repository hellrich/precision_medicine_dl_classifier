Early surgical resection offers the best likelihood of cure. The initial staging of melanoma patients determines subsequent therapeutic decisions and follow-up care. The prognosis and appropriate therapy for each stage of melanoma are discussed. We review the controversy over lymph node dissection, and recent recommendations for the use of lymphoscintigraphy. Interferon-alpha continues to be the only Food and Drug Administration-approved adjuvant therapy for high-risk patients. In addition, the follow-up care of melanoma patients will be discussed.","title":"Current therapy of cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"10349545"}
