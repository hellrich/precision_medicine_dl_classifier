Risk assessment depends on the grade, stage and prostate specific antigen. Options for treatment of localised prostate cancer include active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, curative external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy. Androgen deprivation therapy in combination with radiation therapy has been shown to increase survival in men with high and high/intermediate risk of occult metastases. Survival rates are essentially equivalent for each modality and are over 90% at 10 years and over 75% at 15 years.","title":"Localised prostate cancer - current treatment options.","pubmedId":"22003477"}
