They may occur with familial polyposis syndromes or neurofibromatosis. It can be difficult to distinguish them from their periampullary counterparts on clinical, radiologic or histologic grounds. Because most ampullary and periampullary tumours are malignant, they tend to be treated by radical surgery. A 67-year-old man was seen with a sporadic ampullary hamartoma that simulated cancer. It was successfully treated by local excision through a transverse duodenotomy.","title":"Sporadic ampullary hamartoma simulating cancer.","pubmedId":"9194785"}
