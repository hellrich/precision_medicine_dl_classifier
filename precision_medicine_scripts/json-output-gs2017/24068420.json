The initial examination detects a fleshy tumor, orange in color, under the superior temporal bulbar conjunctiva, as well as two oval-shaped hyperpigmented conjunctival lesions, near the limbus at 10 o\u0027clock, causing moderate blepharoptosis. Vision was normal, there was no diplopia, proptosis, afferent pupillary defect or lymphadenopathy; there was no orbital involvement in MRI. An isolated 15/15 mm tumor, with no connections with the eye socket, was excised. Histopathology revealed a poorly differentiated myxoid liposarcoma. Five recurrences occurred, of which four were treated by local excision and the last required exenteration. Repeat histopathology detects lipoblasts, small round cells, with immunohistochemistry positive for CD34, S100 and vimentin. The last two rapidly evolving and large recurrences, as well as pulmonary metastasis and finally death of the patient, underlined the aggressive character of round cell conjunctival liposarcoma.\nConjunctival myxoid liposarcoma is characterized by numerous local recurrences, but the speed of the succession and volume of the recurrences may suggest a change in the underlying histopathological aspect, that is definitory for the therapeutical and prognostic approach of the case.","title":"Myxoid/round cell conjunctival liposarcoma.
