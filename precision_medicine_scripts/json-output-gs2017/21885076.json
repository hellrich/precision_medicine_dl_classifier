However, the interest on metabolism has been recently renewed by the discovery of recurrent mutation of IDH1 genes by systematic sequencing of a glioblastoma series. IDH1 encodes the cytoplasmic NADP dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase1 that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate. IDH1, more rarely IDH2, is mutated in 40% of gliomas (roughly 70% of low-grade gliomas, 50% of grade III, and 5 to 10% of primary glioblastomas). IDH1/IDH2 mutations are associated with genomic profile, being present in nearly all the 1p19q codeleted gliomas, and virtually absent in gliomas with EGFR amplification. It is a strong and independent predictor of survival, whatever grade considered. IDH1/IDH2 mutation results in a new enzymatic activity transforming α-ketoglutarate into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). The oncometabolite 2-HG accumulates in the cell and acts as a competitive inhibitor of many α-ketoglutarate dependent cellular reactions. The cellular consequences of this mutation offer potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics.","title":"Metabolism of glioma and IDH1/IDH2 mutations.","pubmedId":"21885076"}
