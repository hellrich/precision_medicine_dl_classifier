Bevacizumab is a monoclonal anti-body targeting VEGF, and cetuximab and panitumumab are monoclonal anti-bodies targeting EGFR. In some clinical trials, these drugs brings a survival benefit with acceptable toxicity. In Western, bevacizumab, cetuximab and panitumumab have been already approved for patients with unresectable colorectal cancer, and used in clinical practice. In Japan, bevacizumab was approved in April 2007, cetuximab and panitumumab probably will be approved within several years. It is very important to know their efficacy and safety of these drugs for the clinical practice of Japanese patients.","title":"[Molecular target therapy and chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"18487907"}
