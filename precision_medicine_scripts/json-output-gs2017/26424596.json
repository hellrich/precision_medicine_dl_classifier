In this study we aimed to evaluate the frequency of PTEN alteration and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and possible link between these two biomarkers in Iranian men.\nWe assessed 42 fresh frozen tissue samples of prostate cancer (PCA) obtained by radical prostatectomy, interrogating the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene along with PTEN gene status using Real Time PCR and FISH methods.\nUsing Real Time PCR we identified the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in 64% (27/42) of tumor samples, which was confirmed by FISH technique, giving 21 positive samples with deletion, suggesting the presence of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene. By contrast, PTEN deletion was detected in 52% (11/21) of PCA samples, which all showed low expression in Real Time. Concomitance of PTEN deletion or low expression and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was present in PCA samples (P\u003d0.005). All of the PTEN deletion samples showed TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, (11/11, 100%) while not all of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive samples showed PTEN deletion. None of 29 cases of BPH and 8 cases of normal zone of tumor tissue showed TMPRSS2-ERG fusion.\nThese results indicate that PTEN loss occurs in cooperation with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in PCA. While the majority of PCA samples harbor TMPRSS2-ERG fusion as well as PTEN gene deletion, normal tissues do not show these molecular aberrations.","title":"Frequency of PTEN alterations, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and their association in prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"26424596"}
