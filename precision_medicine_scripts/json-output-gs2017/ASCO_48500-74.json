Methods: We conducted a clinical trial (NCT00578396) to determine if dietary derived Res inhibits Wnt signaling in colonic mucosa. 30 normal volunteers were placed on a controlled low Res diet for 2 weeks after which sigmoidoscopy was performed to biopsy colonic mucosa. Participants were then assigned to one of three cohorts ingesting 1/3, 2/3 or 1 lbs of red grapes per day for 2 weeks, followed by an additional biopsy. Biopsies were evaluated for Ki67 expression by fluorescent IHC. Parallel samples were processed for RNA to evaluate Wnt pathway target gene expression by qRT-PCR. Pre- and post-grape results were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: A diet supplemented with grapes led to a reduction in weight (174.5 lbs to 172.1 lbs; p \u003d 0.0018) and fat intake (35.1  7.8% to 30.8  6.1%; p \u003d 0.01). Grape ingestion decreased colonic mucosal proliferation: cyclinD1 expression decreased significantly (p \u003c 0.01) as did positive staining for Ki67 (18.3  6.75 to 11.9  4.67; p \u003d 0.016) in colonocytes in the bottom 1/3 of the colonic crypt. Expression of several Wnt target genes was downregulated though the suppression was statistically significant only for cyclinD1 and CD133. Interestingly, participants over the age of 50 expressed significantly higher basal levels of cyclinD1, axin II, c-jun, c-myc, and CD133 (all p \u003c 0.05) compared to younger subjects. Grape ingestion in the older participants reduced expression to levels equivalent to basal levels in younger individuals. Conclusions: After just two weeks, a grape supplemented diet reduced colonic mucosal proliferation and expression of Wnt target genes and a colonic stem cell marker (CD133). These data suggest a mechanism for and potential utility of dietary approaches with Res rich foods for colon cancer prevention.","title":"Dietary grape-derived resveratrol for colon cancer prevention.","pubmedId":"ASCO_48500-74"}
