Therefore, it is paramount to delineate the molecular characteristics of this disease entity.\nIn this study, we retrospectively examined the surgical specimens of 61 patients who underwent lung surgery. Mutational or gene amplification statuses of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), k-ras, c-kit, c-met, and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) were examined using genomic DNA sequencing, real-time PCR and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\nThe median age was 61 years, and 50 patients were men and 11 were women. In the histologic review of epithelial component, adenocarcinoma were in 44 cases (72%), squamous cell carcinoma in 15 (25%) and large cell carcinoma in 2 patients (3%). Overall, 30 cases (49%) had any molecular alterations. Nine patients (15%) possessed EGFR deletion in exon 19 (n \u003d 8) or L858R mutations in exon 21 (n \u003d 1), while 3 other cases having atypical EGFR mutations. Six patients (9.8%) had k-ras mutations in exon 12, and 3 had c-kit mutations. High gene copy number of c-met was found in 11 patients (18.0%) and that of FGFR was in 6 patients (9.8%). No significant relationships were identified among the occurrence and type of mutations and patient survival or any other clinicopathological variables.\nGiven the diverse repertoire of mutational profiles observed in PPC samples, clinical trials based on accurate cancer-genotyping should be considered as a legitimate treatment scheme for this rare disease entity in the future.","title":"Molecular profiles of EGFR, K-ras, c-met, and FGFR in pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma, a rare lung malignancy.","pubmedId":"21626008"}
