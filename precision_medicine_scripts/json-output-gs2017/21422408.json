Mainly small studies have addressed the association between clotting factor gene polymorphisms and the onset of colorectal cancer. We examined the association between six well-known clotting factor gene polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk in a large case-control study.\nFactor V Leiden (rs6025), prothrombin G20210A (rs1799963), PAI-1 4G/5G (rs1799889), MTHFR 677C\u003eT (rs1801133), fibrinogen gamma 10034C\u003eT (rs2066865), and factor XIII Val34Leu (rs5985) were genotyped in 1,801 patients with colorectal cancer and 1,853 healthy controls from a large German population-based study. The risk of colorectal cancer associated with gene variants was determined by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs using logistic regression.\nHomozygous carriers of the prothrombotic factor V Leiden polymorphism showed a 5.8-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.69 to 19.72) for colorectal cancer compared with noncarriers. A 30% reduced risk was found for heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden (OR \u003d 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.90) and prothrombin G20210A (OR \u003d 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.96), implying an advantage for slightly increased thrombin generation. Carriers of the antithrombotic factor XIII Val34Leu polymorphism showed a 15% reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer (OR \u003d 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.97) compared with noncarriers. Our results did not support an effect of PAI-1 4G/5G, MTHFR 677C\u003eT, and fibrinogen gamma 10034C\u003eT on colorectal cancer risk.\nOur results support a role of clotting factor polymorphisms and thereby the coagulation system in the risk of colorectal cancer.","title":"Clotting factor gene polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk.","pubmedId":"21422408"}
