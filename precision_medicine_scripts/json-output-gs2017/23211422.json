The aim of this study was to investigate the response rate in platinum-resistant, KRAS wild-type ovarian cancer patients treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) supplemented with panitumumab.\nMajor eligibility criteria were relapsed ovarian/fallopian/peritoneal cancer patients with platinum-resistant disease, measurable disease by GCIG CA125 criteria and KRAS wild-type. Patients were treated with panitumumab 6 mg/kg day 1 and day 15 and with PLD 40 mg/m2 day 1, every 4 weeks.\nForty-six patients were enrolled by 6 study sites in this multi-institutional phase II trial. The response rate in the intention-to-treat population (n \u003d 43) was 18.6%. Progression-free and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 2.7 months (2.5-3.2 months, 95% confidence interval) and 8.1 months (5.6-11.7 months, 95% confidence interval), respectively. The most common treatment-related grade 3 toxicities included skin toxicity (42%), fatigue (19%), and vomiting (12%).\nThe combination of PLD and panitumumab demonstrates efficacy in platinum refractory/resistant patients but the skin toxicity was considerable.","title":"Panitumumab and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer with KRAS wild-type: the PaLiDo study, a phase II nonrandomized multicenter study.","pubmedId":"23211422"}
