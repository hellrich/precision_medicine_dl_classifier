We analyzed the transcriptome of lung adenocarcinomas and normal lung tissue by expression profiling and found that ETS2 was significantly downregulated in adenocarcinomas. In this study, we probed the yet unknown functional role of ETS2 in lung cancer pathogenesis.\nLung adenocarcinomas (n \u003d 80) and normal lung tissues (n \u003d 30) were profiled using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST platform. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was conducted to determine ETS2 protein expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histologic tissue specimens (n \u003d 201). Patient clinical outcome, based on ETS2 IHC expression, was statistically assessed using the log-rank and Kaplan-Meier tests. RNA interference and overexpression strategies were used to assess the effects of ETS2 expression on the transcriptome and on various malignant phenotypes.\nETS2 expression was significantly reduced in lung adenocarcinomas compared with normal lung (P \u003c 0.001). Low ETS2 IHC expression was a significant predictor of shorter time to recurrence in NSCLC (P \u003d 0.009, HR \u003d 1.89) and adenocarcinoma (P \u003d 0.03, HR \u003d 1.86). Moreover, ETS2 was found to significantly inhibit lung cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion (P \u003c 0.05), and microarray and pathways analysis revealed significant (P \u003c 0.001) activation of the HGF pathway following ETS2 knockdown. In addition, ETS2 was found to suppress MET phosphorylation and knockdown of MET expression significantly attenuated (P \u003c 0.05) cell invasion mediated by ETS2-specific siRNA. Furthermore, knockdown of ETS2 augmented HGF-induced MET phosphorylation, cell migration, and invasion.\nOur findings point to a tumor suppressor role for ETS2 in human NSCLC pathogenesis through inhibition of the MET proto-oncogene.","title":"ETS2 mediated tumor suppressive function and MET oncogene inhibition in human non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23659968"}
