They had many coexisting DIS diagnoses, and some of them had no DIS diagnosis. The key to the coexistence relationships in DIS diagnosis was a major depressive episode, and the subjects were classified into four types by the DIS coexistence relationships; Type I: 28 cases (26.4%) had coexisting diagnoses belonging to anxiety disorders or somatoform disorders, in addition to a major depressive episode. They were suffering from clinically severe neurosis accompanied by borderline personality disorder. Type II: 30 cases (28.3%) belonged to anxiety disorders or somatoform disorders without a major depressive episode without anxiety disorders or somatoform disorders, and had clinically depressive neurosis or depressive episode with less distortion of the personality. Type IV: 30 cases (28.3%) were other than Type I-III, and were clinically similar to symptomatic neurosis.","title":"Neurosis from the viewpoint of DIS (Diagnostic Interview Schedule).","pubmedId":"2637387"}
