Selected sarcoma subtypes are being treated with Trabectedin in second line, which promotes DNA damage and p53-dependent apoptosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the improvement of Trabectedin response with MDM2 inhibitors in soft tissue sarcomas. The antitumor effects of Trabectedin, Nutlin-3A and RG7112 as single agents or in combination were examined in vitro. RG7112 significantly synergized with Trabectedin in MDM2-amplified liposarcoma cells, representing a promising new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of sarcomas with MDM2 amplification.","title":"RG7112, a Small-Molecule Inhibitor of MDM2, Enhances Trabectedin Response in Soft Tissue Sarcomas.","pubmedId":"26279182"}
