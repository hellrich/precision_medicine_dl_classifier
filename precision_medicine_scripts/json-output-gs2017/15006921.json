To avoid the potential influence of subclinical cancer on IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, all subjects in this study were alive without clinical evidence of cancer during their 5th year of the cohort follow-up. Four hundred randomly selected cohort controls and 93 incident pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases that occurred between their 5th follow-up year through 1997 (i.e., up to 12.7 years of follow-up) were included in this study. Concentrations of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were measured in serum samples obtained at baseline using ELISA. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression models, adjusted for confounders. Neither IGF-1, IGFBP-3, nor the IGF-1:IGFBP-3 molar ratio was significantly associated with pancreatic cancer: highest compared to lowest tertile, OR \u003d 0.67, 95% CI 0.37-1.21, P trend \u003d 0.17; OR \u003d 0.70, 95% CI 0.38-1.27, P trend \u003d 0.12; and OR \u003d 0.85, 95% CI 0.50-1.46, P trend \u003d 0.54, respectively. Our results do not support the hypothesis that serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations are associated with pancreatic cancer risk among male smokers. Further studies are necessary to evaluate these associations in other populations.","title":"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-binding protein-3, and pancreatic cancer in male smokers.","pubmedId":"15006921"}
