About one third of all melanomas detected disseminate, with the metastatic spread occurring either via lymphatic or blood vessels. In the treatment of advanced melanoma the conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy has not been very successful. Melanoma is known to have immunologically provocative features. In recent years immunological therapies, mainly cytokines, have been applied in the treatment of melanoma. The most widely used cytokines are Interferons and interleukin-2. These agents are used either alone or in combination with each other or with chemotherapeutics. Interferon and interleukin-2 therapies have yielded response rates of 15-20% on average, whereas combinations of immunotherapy and chemotherapy offer response rates as high as 50-60%. Unfortunately, average survival of patients with disseminated melanoma has been short, from 6 to 12 months. The immunotherapy approach has yielded some long-term responses and probably even a cure for a small proportion of patients. Understanding of basic mechanisms of tumour destruction by cytokines and new agents coming into clinical use will undoubtedly further improve treatment results.","title":"Cytokine therapy of malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"8811166"}
