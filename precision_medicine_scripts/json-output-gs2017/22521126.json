This study was to determine the protein expression of PTEN and phosphorylation of PTEN (p-PTEN) at residue Ser380 in different histology specimens of gastric tissues.\nA total of 179tissue specimens of normal gastric mucosa, chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and gastric cancer were recruited for immunohistochemical analysis of PTEN and p-PTEN expression. Four gastric cancer AGS, MKN-45, MKN-28, and SGC-7901 cell lines and a non-cancerous gastric GES-1 cell line were used to detect expression of PTEN and p-PTEN protein using Western blot.\nExpression level of PTEN protein was significantly decreased in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal gastric mucosa, chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia (P\u003c0.05). In contrast, p-PTEN protein level was significantly increased in intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and gastric cancer compared to normal gastric mucosa and chronic gastritis (P\u003c0.05). However, there was no any association of PTEN and p-PTEN expression with clinicopathological characteristics from gastric cancer patients. Moreover, the ratio of p-PTEN and PTEN was higher in gastric cancer cell lines than that of the non-malignant cells.\nThis study demonstrated that aberrant expression of PTEN and p-PTEN at residue Ser380 was early event that could contribute to gastric carcinogenesis, and that PTEN phosphorylation at residue Ser380 could be a mechanism for PTEN inactivation.","title":"Reduced expression of PTEN and increased PTEN phosphorylation at residue Ser380 in gastric cancer tissues: a novel mechanism of PTEN inactivation.","pubmedId":"22521126"}
