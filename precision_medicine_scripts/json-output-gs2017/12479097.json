Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which could degrade ECM, were implicated in cancer invasion and metastasis. Activated MMPs were controlled by specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). This study was designed to investigate the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1, TIMP-2 in human squamous cell carcinomas of uterine cervix, and the association with invasion and metastasis of human squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix.\nTissue samples from 40 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, 29 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and 16 cases of normal cervices were stained immunohistochemically.\nImmunohistochemical staining of tumor cells for MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were noted 82.5%, 70.0%, 62.5%, and 97.5% in carcinomas, 44.8%, 62.1%, 86.21%, and 96.55% in CIN lesions respectively, for MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 in 25.0% normal cervices, but for TIMP-2 in 56.25% normal cervices. There was significant difference for MMP-2 among carcinomas, normal cervices, and CIN respectively (P \u003c 0.01). There was significant difference for MMP-9 among normal cervices, carcinomas, and CIN, respectively (P \u003c 0.05). The positive rates of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in the cervical carcinoma group and CIN group were obviously higher than that in normal cervical group(P \u003c 0.01). The positive rates of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in lymph node metastasis were obviously higher than that in without lymph node metastasis(P \u003c 0.01), but for TIMP-2 was contrary and there was no significant difference for TIMP-1. No significant correlation could be established among the expression of these markers and the tumor diameter, the clinical stage, and pathologic grade.\nThe over-expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 may play a key role in invasion and lymph-node metastasis of in squamous carcinoma of the cervix.","title":"[Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, 9 and their inhibitor-TIMP 1,2 in human squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix].","pubmedId":"12479097"}
