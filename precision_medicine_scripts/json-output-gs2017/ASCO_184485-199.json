The response of patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma to checkpoint inhibitor therapy is so far unknown. A previous study suggested a higher response rate of NRAS-mutated melanoma to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 with an objective response in 7 out of 11 (64%) patients compared to 35% and 21% in BRAF wildtype or BRAF V600-mutated melanoma, respectively. Methods: In total, 224 patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma were analyzed. Of these, 180 patients received ipilimumab, 98 anti-PD1 monotherapy, and one patient combined ipilimumab and anti-PD1 therapy. We evaluated overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival to checkpoint inhibitor therapy in these patients. Results: In this patient cohort with NRAS-mutated melanoma, 27% had brain metastases, 62% an elevated LDH and 22% an ECOG \u003e \u003d 1. ORR was 15% for treatment with ipilimumab and 34% for anti-PD1 therapy. Disease control rates were 27% for ipilimumab and 52% for anti-PD1 therapy. PFS was 4.5 months for ipilimumab and 11.4 months for anti-PD1 therapy. Overall survival of all patients was 29 months. Conclusions: The efficacy data of ipilimumab or anti-PD1 therapy in NRAS-mutated melanoma patients were similar to the known response rates of NRAS wildtype melanoma patients.","title":"NRAS-mutated melanoma patients have similar response rates to therapy with checkpoint inhibitors as other cohorts.","pubmedId":"ASCO_184485-199"}
