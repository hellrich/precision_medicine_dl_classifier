Surgeons are consequently divided between opposed to and in favor of routine central neck dissection associated with total thyroidectomy.\nClinical records of 210 patients undergoing from January 2000 to December 2006 total thyroidectomy without routine lymph node dissection were retrospectively evaluated. One hundred and ninety eight patients (94.2%) underwent radioiodine ablation as well, followed by Thyroid Stimulating Hormone suppression therapy. In patients with loco regional lymph nodal recurrence, central (VI) and ipsilateral (III-IV) lymph node dissection was performed.\nIncidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism (iPTH \u003c 10 pg/ml) and permanent vocal fold paralysis were respectively 1.4% and 1.9%. After an 8-year mean follow-up, the rate of loco regional recurrence was 4.2%-9/210 patients. In these cases selective lymph node dissection was carried out without complications.\nThe role of neck dissection in papillary thyroid cancer management, is still subject of research and controversial regarding routine or therapeutic indications, surgical extension, its impact on local recurrence and survival.\nA low loco regional recurrence rate may be observed after total thyroidectomy without prophylactic lymph node dissection. Lymph nodal recurrences were more frequent in young male patients, sometime affected by follicular variant, in each case less than 2 cm. There is a general agreement about the extension of therapeutic lymph node dissection, while routine central neck dissection is still controversial and may be indicated in high risk patients.","title":"Clinicopathological pattern of lymph node recurrence of papillary thyroid cancer.
