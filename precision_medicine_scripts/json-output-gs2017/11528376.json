This activated form of ras has always been described as a dominant oncogene. A new study indicates that wildtype Kras2 has properties of a tumor suppressor gene and may have the capacity to reduce the transforming potential of oncogenically activated ras.","title":"A new verdict for an old convict.","pubmedId":"11528376"}
