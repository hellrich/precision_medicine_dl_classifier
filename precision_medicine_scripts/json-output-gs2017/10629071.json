We examined 33 primary ovarian cancers and 3 ovarian borderline tumors for allelic imbalance (AI) of the 10q23.3 region using 5 polymorphic markers, including an insertion/deletion-type polymorphic marker identified in intron 4 of the PTEN gene. AI at one or more loci was detected in 12 of 31 (39%) informative ovarian cancers and none of 3 ovarian borderline tumors. The commonly deleted region was mapped between the D10S215 and D10S541 loci, including the PTEN locus. Moreover, the incidence of AI at the PTEN locus (38%) was the highest among the 5 loci examined. Therefore, we searched for mutations in the entire coding region of the PTEN gene by PCR-SSCP and sequencing analyses in these tumors and 7 ovarian cancer cell lines. Mutations were detected in 3 of the 33 (9%) ovarian cancers: 2 cases with double mutations and 1 case with a mutation on 1 allele accompanied by deletions on both alleles in the poly T tract preceding the splice acceptor site in intron 7. An intragenic deletion was detected in 1 of the 7 (14%) ovarian cancer cell lines. PTEN mutations were detected not only in the endometrioid type but also in the serous and mucinous types of ovarian cancer. However, PTEN was not mutated in the 12 tumors that showed AI of the PTEN locus. Our results suggest that the PTEN gene plays an important role in the development of a subset but diverse histological types of ovarian tumors. However, it is possible that another tumor-suppressor gene in the close vicinity of the PTEN gene is also inactivated by AI of the 10q23.3 region.","title":"Allelic imbalance and mutations of the PTEN gene in ovarian cancer.","pubmedId":"10629071"}
