{"keywords":["Concurrent radiation and chemotherapy","Locally advanced breast cancer","Reirradiation"],"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"The authors present a case report of a patient with breast cancer diagnosed in 2005, treated with conservative surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, followed by hormonal therapy until 2010, who relapsed under the form of inflammatory breast cancer in 2011. After tumor progression detected during primary systemic therapy, a concurrent radiation and radiosensitizing chemotherapy were proposed. There was a significant clinical response to this treatment, enabling curative chance with total mastectomy. The histological examination of the breast and regional lymph nodes revealed a complete response, since there was no evidence of residual tumor. There are few reports concerning concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer, but it could be a suitable \"loco regional rescue therapy\" to further reduce tumor progression and allow curative surgery. Study of this treatment strategy in randomized clinical trials is warranted.
