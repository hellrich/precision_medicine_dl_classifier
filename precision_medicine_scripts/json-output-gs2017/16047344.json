The genetically homogeneous Sardinian population may be useful for defining the role of such genetic alterations further through a clinical evaluation program.\nOne hundred two of 659 patients with breast carcinoma (15.5%) who were collected consecutively had a family history of breast carcinoma and were screened for BRCA1/2 mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequencing.\nThree deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations were detected in 15 of 102 families (14.7%), including 13 families (86.7%) with BRCA2 mutations and 2 families (13.3%) with BRCA1 mutations. A single variant, BRCA2-8765delAG, was the most recurrent mutation in the series and was found in 12 of 102 families (11.8%) and in 18 of 657 patients (2.7%). The average age at diagnosis was significantly younger in families with BRCA1/2 mutations (48.6 yrs) compared with the age of patients who had no detectable mutation (52.9 yrs; P \u003d 0.039). Moreover, BRCA1/2 mutations were found at a significantly higher rate in families who had at least 1 member with ovarian carcinoma or male breast carcinoma (5 of 12 families; 41.7%) than in families without such an association (10 of 90 families; 11.1%; P \u003d 0.003).\nBRCA2 mutations were approximately 6 times more prevalent than BRCA1 mutations. A diagnosis of breast carcinoma before age 50 years, ovarian carcinoma, male breast carcinoma, and 3 affected generations all were associated significantly with BRCA1/2 mutations. Although the current findings provided further support for the hypothesis that additional breast carcinoma susceptibility genes remain to be identified, such indicators of the presence of BRCA1/2 mutations may be useful in counseling patients about undergoing genetic testing.","title":"Spectrum and prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in Sardinian patients with breast carcinoma through hospital-based screening.","pubmedId":"16047344"}
