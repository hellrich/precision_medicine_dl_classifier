Endoscopy is the main diagnostic tool for tumors of moderate diameter (\u003c5cm). Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the best procedure to differenciate GISTs from other submucosal tumors. Fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) allow to obtain an histological diagnosis if necessary. Surgery remain the gold standard of treatment for localized GISTs, whereas endoscopic resection is not recommended for these tumors.","title":"[Endoscopic approach to GIST].","pubmedId":"19060841"}
