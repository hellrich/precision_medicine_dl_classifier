However, it is unclear whether IDH1 mutation is associated with a less aggressive phenotype or directly linked to increased sensitivity to radiotherapy.\nWe determined the influence of IDH1(R132H) mutant protein on proliferation and growth in 3D culture, migration, cell survival and radiosensitivity in vitro under normoxia (21% O2) and hypoxia (\u003c1% O2) in a panel of human malignant glioma cell lines (U-251MG, U-343MG, LN-229) with stable overexpression of wild-type (IDH1(wt)) and mutated IDH1 (IDH1(R132H)).\nOverexpression of IDH1(R132H) in glioma cells resulted in slightly decreased cell proliferation, considerably reduced cell migration and caused differences in growth properties in 3D spheroid cultures. Furthermore, IDH1(R132H)-positive cells consistently demonstrated an increased radiosensitivity in human malignant glioma cells U-251MG (DMF10: 1.52, p\u003c0.01 and 1.42, p\u003c0.01), U-343MG (DMF10: 1.78, p\u003c0.01 and 1.75, p\u003c0.01) and LN-229 (DMF10: 1.41, p\u003c0.05 and 1.68, p\u003c0.01) under normoxia and hypoxia, respectively.\nOur data indicate that IDH1(R132H) mutation causes both a less aggressive biological behavior and direct radiosensitization of human malignant glioma cells. Targeting IDH1 appears to be an attractive approach in combination with radiotherapy.","title":"IDH1(R132H) mutation causes a less aggressive phenotype and radiosensitizes human malignant glioma cells independent of the oxygenation status.","pubmedId":"26328938"}
