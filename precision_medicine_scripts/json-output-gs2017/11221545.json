A retrospective study was performed evaluating 76 familial breast cancer patients in 69 families, which included two BRCA1 related cases and six BRCA2 related cases. Patients were compared with 425 non-familial sporadic cases. Familial breast cancer patients had similar ages and stages as non-familial patients (mean, 46.6 years vs 48.9 years, p \u003d 0.306). However, the familial breast cancer patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 related cases presented at lower stages (p \u003d 0.034) and younger ages than non-familial patients (mean, 45.1 years vs 48.9 years P \u003d 0.042). The occurrence of infiltrating ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ was not significantly different in the two groups. Mucinous carcinoma was represented with 6.7% (4/76) and 1.3% (1/76) medullary carcinoma. The overall grade of familial breast cancer, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 related cases in 8 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, was significantly higher than that of controls. The mean follow up was 4.5 years for familial breast cancers. Five- and 10-year overall survival rates were 69% and 61% for those with a family history, compared with 86% and 64% for those in the control group (p \u003d 0.644). There were no statistically significant differences in disease-free survival rates between the two groups at 5 or 10 years (69% vs 78% in 5 years; 48% vs 58% in 10 years) (p \u003d 0.862). Despite the younger ages and earlier stages at presentation in familial breast cancer patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 related cases, the familial breast cancer patients had higher grade patholobiologic characteristics, but similar prognoses when compared with sporadic breast cancer patients. Owing to the limited number of familial cases in this study, more cases and longer follow up are needed.","title":"Familial breast cancer in southern Taiwan.","pubmedId":"11221545"}
