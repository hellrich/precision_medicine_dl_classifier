In the present study, we demonstrate that selective BRAF(V600E) inhibition activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which induces autophagy as a mechanism of therapeutic resistance in human cancers. The present data show AMPK-dependent cytoprotective roles of autophagy under conditions of therapeutic BRAF(V600E) inhibition, and AMPK was negatively correlated with BRAF(V600E)-dependent activation of MEK-ERK-RSK signaling and positively correlated with unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), a key initiator of autophagy. Furthermore, selective BRAF(V600E) inhibition and concomitant suppression of autophagy led to the induction of apoptosis. Taken together, present experiments indicate that AMPK plays a role in the survival of BRAF(V600E) CRC cells by selective inhibition and suggest that the control of autophagy contributes to overcome the chemoresistance of BRAF(V600E) CRC cells.
