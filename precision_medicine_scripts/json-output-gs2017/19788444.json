The purpose of this study was to ascertain the utility of the RAF/RAS mutational status as a diagnostic adjunct in lesions with histologic features that deviate from a typical Spitz nevus and, to examine expression of Insulin growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), a tumor suppressor acting through autocrine/paracrine pathways to inhibit BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling, in the same. Genomic DNA for genotyping was isolated from 6 regular Spitz nevi and 14 atypical spitzoid nevomelanocytic proliferations (including 1 melanoma with spitzoid histomorphology). NRAS1, NRAS2 and KRAS were analyzed, in addition to BRAFV600E. A mutation in BRAFV600E was noted in only one case-that of a regular Spitz nevus. IGFBP7 expression appeared to be maintained in this case, but was absent in 7/17 cases, which included 5 atypical spitzoid nevomelanocytic proliferations. Lack of expression of IGFBP7 in atypical spitzoid nevomelanocytic proliferations with histologically concerning features but BRAF-WT indicates that the evolutionary path in atypical spitzoid nevomelanocytic proliferations is genetically distinct from that of IGFBP7-negative BRAF-positive melanoma. From an oncogenic BRAF perspective, our findings suggest that the majority of \u0027atypical\u0027 spitzoid nevomelanocytic proliferations are probably no different from conventional Spitz nevi.","title":"Oncogenic BRAF and the tumor suppressor IGFBP7 in the genesis of atypical spitzoid nevomelanocytic proliferations.","pubmedId":"19788444"}
