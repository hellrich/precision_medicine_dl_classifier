It commonly occurs in the extremities with extrapulmonary metastatic potential. Round cell liposarcoma, recently, is widely agreed to be the aggressive counterpart of the myxoid liposarcoma, mostly arising in adverse, local recurrence, and metastatic lesions. Metastatic liposarcoma with pure myxoid element is unusual. The authors report an extremely rare case of a 47-year-old Thai male patient having a metastatic pure myxoid liposarcoma to the thoracic vertebrae, one year after primary tumor documented on the left thigh. Histology of the primary and metastatic sites shows only myxoid pattern. Round cell feature was not documented. To the best of the authors\u0027 knowledge, this is the second case report of metastatic myxoid liposarcoma without round cell morphology.","title":"Neurological deficit from metastatic low grade liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"16146262"}
