The purpose of this review was to summarize the existing epidemiologic evidence of the adverse effect of breast cancer, cutaneous malignant melanoma, and Hodgkin\u0027s disease on birth outcome.\nThe MEDLINE database was used to review the literature systematically. Studies that examined the following outcomes were included: preterm birth, low birth weight, low birth weight at term, stillbirths, congenital abnormalities, male proportion of newborns, and mean birth weight. Studies were grouped according to whether the woman had been diagnosed with the specific cancer before, during, or shortly after pregnancy.\nFew data exist on birth outcome in women with breast cancer, melanoma, or Hodgkin\u0027s disease. The overall results from the limited number of studies, which included a comparison group for birth outcome, were reassuring. However, for women diagnosed with breast cancer before pregnancy, the only 2 studies that included comparison groups for birth outcome had conflicting results regarding the risk of preterm birth and congenital abnormalities. Furthermore, a recent cohort study of birth outcome in women who were diagnosed with Hodgkin\u0027s disease before pregnancy indicated a slightly increased risk of congenital abnormalities among the newborns.\nOverall, the existing studies offer reassuring results concerning the risks of adverse birth outcome for women diagnosed with breast cancer, melanoma, or Hodgkin\u0027s disease before, during or shortly after pregnancy. A limitation of most studies was the imprecise risk estimates caused by the small number of adverse birth outcomes and the lack of results stratified by treatment. Therefore, international collaboration is necessary in the future, to obtain more precise risk estimates for adverse birth outcomes, and to allow stratified analyses according to, for example, treatment.","title":"Birth outcome in women with breast cancer, cutaneous malignant melanoma, or Hodgkin\u0027s disease: a review.","pubmedId":"21326655"}
