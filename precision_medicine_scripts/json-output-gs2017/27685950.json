Thus, we compared the EGFR mutation status of LN samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA and PTs to estimate the efficacy of using EBUS-TBNA specimens for EGFR testing in advanced, non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nUsing data of patients from the EBUS-TBNA database (N \u003d 1914) obtained between January 2009 and January 2013, we identified 100 treatment-na√Øve, advanced, non-squamous NSCLC patients (stage 3 and 4) with matched LN specimens obtained by EBUS-TBNA and PT specimens. Of these, 74 patients with paired specimens were feasible for EGFR mutation analysis, which we performed using a direct sequencing method.\nOf the 74 cases, at least one major [exon 19 deleted (19del) and L858R] or minor (T790M, exon 20 insertion, and other point mutations) EGFR mutation was detected in 31 cases (41.9%), which included PT (n \u003d 31, 41.9%) and LN (n \u003d 28, 37.8%) specimens. Major mutations were detected in 25 PT (33.8%, 19del \u003d 13, L858R \u003d 12) and 22 LN (29.8%, 19del \u003d 11, L858R \u003d 11) specimens. The discordance rate in major mutations between matched PT and LN specimens was 4.1% (3/74). Among minor mutations, T790M was detected in LN specimen only in 2 cases with L858R in PT and LN. The discordance rate major and minor EGFR mutations combined between matched PT and LN specimens was 12% (9/74).\nWe observed a high concordance rate of major EGFR mutations between matched LN specimens sampled by EBUS-TBNA and PTs, suggesting that LN samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA from advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients are effective for use in EGFR mutation testing.","title":"Comparison of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations between Metastatic Lymph Node Diagnosed by EBUS-TBNA and Primary Tumor in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","pubmedId":"27685950"}
