Here, we investigated the lipid binding properties of the PHs of type II DGK isozymes using protein-lipid overlay and liposome binding assays. The PH of DGKη showed the most pronounced binding activity to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) among the various glycero- and sphingolipids including PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate, PI 3,4-bisphosphate, PI 3-phosphate, PI 4-phosphate, and PI 5-phosphate. Moreover, the PI(4,5)P2binding activity of the DGKη-PH was significantly stronger than that of other type II DGK isozymes. Notably, compared with the PH of phospholipase C (PLC) δ1, which is generally utilized as a cellular PI(4,5)P2- probe, the DGKη-PH is equal to or superior than the PLCδ1-PH in terms of affinity and selectivity for PI(4,5)P2 Furthermore, in COS-7 cells, GFP-fused wild-type DGKη1 and its PH partly translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where the PLCδ1-PH was co-localized in response to hyperosmotic stress in an inositol 5-phosphatase-sensitive manner, whereas a PH deletion mutant did not. Moreover, K74A and R85A mutants of DGKη-PH, which lack the conserved basic amino acids thought to ligate PI(4,5)P2, were indeed unable to bind to PI(4,5)P2and co-localize with the PLCδ1-PH even in osmotically shocked cells. Overexpression of wild-type DGKη1 enhanced EGF-dependent phosphorylation of ERK, whereas either K74A or R85A mutant did not. Taken together, these results indicate that the DGKη-PH preferentially interacts with PI(4,5)P2and has crucial roles in regulating the subcellular localization and physiological function of DGKη. Moreover, the DGKη-PH could serve as an excellent cellular sensor for PI(4,5)P2.
