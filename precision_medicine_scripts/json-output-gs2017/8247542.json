Previous work has shown that the expression of this gene is frequently unregulated in human breast carcinoma-derived cell lines and in tumour biopsy material. As there is no evidence of gene amplification, we decided to examine the control of c-erbB-3 transcription in overexpressing cells. In this paper we describe the cloning of the c-erbB-3 promoter and its functional analysis within mammary-derived cell lines. We show that the promoter is more active in overexpressing cells and this is largely due to the action of the OB2-1 transcription factor which we have recently identified as mediating overexpression of the c-erbB-2 promoter in similar cell lines.","title":"Transcriptional regulation of the c-erbB-3 gene in human breast carcinoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"8247542"}
