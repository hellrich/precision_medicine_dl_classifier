In multivariate logistic regression analyses, we studied the association of age and residence county (rural vs urban and micropolitan) with each of 3 CRC treatments by anatomic site.\nAfter adjusting for patient demographics, insurance payer, ratio of providers to population, and cancer stage, patients with colon cancer living in micropolitan counties were more likely to receive chemotherapy than those living in rural counties (P \u003c.001). Compared with patients aged 19 to 64 years, patients with colon cancer 85 years and older (P \u003c.001) and patients with rectal cancer 75 years and older (P \u003c.05) were less likely to undergo surgery. Patients with CRC 75 years and older were less likely to receive radiation, and patients with colon cancer 65 years and older and patients with rectal cancer 75 years and older were less likely to receive chemotherapy (P \u003c.001 for both).\nIn Nebraska, older patients with CRC were less likely to undergo surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Patients with colon cancer in rural counties were less likely to undergo chemotherapy than those in micropolitan counties. Decision makers need to consider issues of age and rural residence in patient access to CRC treatments.","title":"Age and rural residence effects on accessing colorectal cancer treatments: a registry study.","pubmedId":"20394462"}
