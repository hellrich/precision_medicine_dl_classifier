Transfection of H123Y led to the down-regulation of p27(Kip1) and p21(Waf1/Cip1) protein levels and the up-regulation of phosphorylated PKB/Akt. An overexpression of PTEN decreased cyclin E/cdk2 activity and inhibited S-phase entry in MCF-7. In BT-549 these changes were not observed, but overexpression of PTEN led to a diminution of PKB/Akt phosphorylation.\nPTEN function is mediated through the inhibition of the cell cycle and PKB/Akt phosphorylation in breast cancer cells.","title":"Tumour suppressor PTEN regulates cell cycle and protein kinase B/Akt pathway in breast cancer cells.","pubmedId":"16619501"}
