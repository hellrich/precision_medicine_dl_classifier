Currently, the standard endocrine therapy for premenopausal women is tamoxifen; a role for ovarian suppression or ablation has also been identified. Uncertainty remains about the optimal use of endocrine therapy in this setting. The role of ovarian suppression with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor, the optimal duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy and the utility of biomarkers and pharmacogenetic studies to select therapy are questions worthy of further investigation.","title":"Adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with early breast cancer.","pubmedId":"18190722"}
