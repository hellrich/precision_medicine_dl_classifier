This article will describe recent advances in prostate radiotherapy, focussing on the results of randomised trials which have addressed the role of radiation dose escalation and of adjuvant hormone therapy. Current controversies will then be considered, including the merits of radiotherapy in comparison with alternative approaches to early prostate cancer, and the possible role of adjuvant radiation following surgery. Finally, future developments will be described, including hypofractionation and dose individualisation, which have the potential to further improve the outcome of external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.","title":"Radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"12787711"}
