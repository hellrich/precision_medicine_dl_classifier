Now, there is widespread scientific and clinical interest in GIST because its principal pathogenetic defect has been identified and a specific molecular inhibitor of GIST has been developed. Most GISTs contain a gain-of-function mutation in the c-kit proto-oncogene. Mutation results in constitutive activation of the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase, which induces cellular proliferation. STI571 is an oral agent that selectively inhibits Kit. It is a landmark development in cancer treatment and marks a new era of targeted molecular therapy. Its efficacy proves that a specific inhibitor can counteract the effects of a genetic defect responsible for neoplasia. Although STI571 was first applied to GIST only 2 years ago, it has already revolutionized the treatment of patients with metastatic disease and is also currently being tested as an adjuvant therapy after the resection of primary GIST.","title":"The GIST of targeted cancer therapy: a tumor (gastrointestinal stromal tumor), a mutated gene (c-kit), and a molecular inhibitor (STI571).","pubmedId":"12417503"}
