Beyond confirming the structural findings by multinuclear NMR spectroscopic investigations and density functional calculations (RI-BP86/SV(P) level), [Ga(PhC2 H4 Ph)](+) [Al(OR(F))4](-) (4) and [(C6 H5 F)Ga(μ-1,3-Ph2 C6 H4)2 Ga(C6 H5 F)](2+) {[Al(OR(F) )4] (-)}2 (5), featuring ansa-arene ligands, were tested as catalysts for the synthesis of highly reactive polyisobutylene (HR-PIB). In comparison to the recently published 1 and the [Ga(1,3,5-Me3 C6 H3)2](+) [Al(OR(F))4](-) salt (6) (1,3,5-Me3 C6 H3 \u003dmesitylene), 4 and 5 gave slightly reduced reactivities. This allowed for favorably increased polymerization temperatures of up to +15 °C, while yielding HR-PIB with high contents of terminal olefinic double bonds (α-contents\u003d84-93 %), low molecular weights (Mn \u003d1000-3000 g mol(-1)) and good monomer conversions (up to 83 % in two hours). While the chelate complexes delivered more favorable results than 1 and 6, the reaction kinetics resembled and thus concurred with the recently proposed coordinative polymerization mechanism.","title":"Univalent gallium complexes of simple and ansa-arene ligands: effects on the polymerization of isobutylene.","pubmedId":"25382015"}
