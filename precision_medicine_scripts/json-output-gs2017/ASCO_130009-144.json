Pts with tumors carrying EGFR exon 19 del or 21 L858R mutations are particularly sensitive to EGFR TKIs.  Methods:  RADIANT was a randomized trial of postoperative E v P in pts with completely resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC. Pts were stratified by histology (adenocarcinoma, other), stage (IB, II, IIIA), adjuvant chemotherapy (yes, no), smoking history (never, current/former), EGFR FISH (positive, negative/undetermined) and country. Pts were randomized 2:1 to receive E 150mg/day or P for up to 2 yr. Among 973 randomized pts, EGFR mutation status was determined for 921 (95%); 161 (17%) had mutations (55% exon 19 del, 45% exon 21 L858R). These pts form the basis of this report.  Results:  Pts with mutations were more frequently female (65%) and non-smokers (63%); 47% had stage IB, 29% stage II, 22% stage IIIA; 49% received adjuvant chemotherapy; 47% were Asian. Some imbalances were observed (E: less chemo and lower stage; P: smaller tumor size). There were 102 pts randomized to E and 59 to P. Median duration (range) of treatment was 21.2 (0.16-22.93) m for E and 21.9 (2.43-22.93) m for P; 34 (34%) and 24 (41%) pts completed \u003e22 m of E and P, respectively. DFS events occurred in 71 (44%) pts. Pts on E had longer disease-free survival (DFS) v P (median 46.4 v 28.5 m; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.98, p\u003d0.039); however, this result is not statistically significant due to the hierarchical testing procedure. The effect on DFS remained consistent after adjusting for other prognostic variables via an exploratory multivariate Cox model (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36-0.98, p\u003d0.046). There were more brain relapses on E (40%) v P (13%), and fewer bone relapses 14% v 29%. Deaths occurred in 35 (21.7%) pts. There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS median not reached in either arm; HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.56-2.16, p\u003d0.815). For drug-related events, AE, serious AE and discontinuations for AE were higher with E compared to P (98% v 61%; 4% v 0%; 25% v 0%, respectively).  Conclusions:  Although not statistically significant, these data suggest adjuvant E prolongs DFS in pts with completely resected EGFR mutated NSCLC. OS interpretation is limited.
