This is the first report of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in the setting of co-occurrence of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and a BRCA2 mutation. Further cases with a similar presentation should be reported and studies should be directed to identify the possible mechanisms involved.","title":"Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in association with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and a BRCA2 mutation.","pubmedId":"20887823"}
