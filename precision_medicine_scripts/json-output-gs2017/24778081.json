To date, there is no curative therapy for MM. The receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was found to be mutated in many cases of cancer and used as a target in biological therapies. We investigated whether this pharmacological treatment could also be applicable to MM.\nThe state of ALK was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization in 63 MM tissue specimens.\nNone of the 63 MM samples showed overexpression or translocation of ALK.\nOur preliminary data exclude the utility of analysis of the ALK gene in MM and suggest that ALK inhibitor therapy is not applicable to MM.","title":"Status of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) in malignant mesothelioma.","pubmedId":"24778081"}
