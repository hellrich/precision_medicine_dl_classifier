Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TKIs) have been reported to exert a significant impact in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in patients harbouring mutations in the EGFR gene. The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) gene translocation has been described in a subset of patients with NSCLC and possesses potent oncogenic activity. This translocation represents one of the most novel molecular targets in the treatment of NSCLC. Patients who harbour the EML4-ALK rearrangement possess lung tumours that lack EGFR or K-ras mutations. The present study reports the case of a patient possessing the EML4-ALK rearrangement that was initially treated with erlotinib and achieved a lasting clinical response. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first report of a clinical response to EGFR-TKI in a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harbouring the EML4-ALK fusion gene, but no EGFR mutations. However, as the disease progressed, the ALK gene status of the tumour was investigated, and based upon a positive result, the patient was treated with crizotinib and achieved a complete response. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the EML4-ALK rearrangement is not always associated with resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Further studies are required to clarify the biological features of these tumours and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs when the EML4-ALK rearrangement is present.","title":"Response to erlotinib in a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harbouring the EML4-ALK translocation: A case report.","pubmedId":"25788996"}
