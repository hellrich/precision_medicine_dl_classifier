Interpreting PTEN deficiency in the appropriate microscopic context of cancer may be important to understand its role in tumor development and progression. This may be particularly relevant in heterogeneous tumors. Here, we discuss the usefulness of 3D cultures in understanding the consequences of PTEN inactivation in tissue architecture. Afterwards, we discuss the role of immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization in assessing PTEN loss in tumors. In this review, endometrial carcinoma is used as a model.
