The majority of families fulfilling definition of Li-Fraumeni syndrome demonstrate inherited abnormalities involving the p53 gene. Cells with dysfunctional p53 are predisposed to the development of cancer phenotype. Advexin (Introgen Therapeutics Inc., TX, USA) is an adenoviral-based experimental therapeutic that provides delivery of wild-type p53 to cancer cells and demonstrates anticancer activity following adequate expression of p53. Theoretically, correction of p53 function in cancer developing in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome through treatment with Advexin will provide anti-tumor activity. One patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome has been reported to have responded to Advexin. This review will summarize background knowledge of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, mechanisms of Advexin and clinical response of cancer to Advexin with a focus on Li-Fraumeni syndrome.","title":"Potential of Advexin: a p53 gene-replacement therapy in Li-Fraumeni syndrome.","pubmedId":"19086841"}
