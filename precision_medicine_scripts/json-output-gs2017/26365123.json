Twelve patients with normal MII-pH profiles were not considered for analysis. The reflux parameters of 113 GERD patients with abnormal MII-pH results were analyzed.\n(1) DeMeester scores were above the normal range in 46.90% (53/113) of GERD patients. Weakly acidic refluxes were prevalent in GERD patients, and the frequency of abnormal weakly acidic reflux was 75.22% (85/113). The frequencies of abnormal symptom index (SI) and symptom association probability (SAP) were 19.47% (22/113) and 14.16% (16/113), respectively. (2) The frequencies of DeMeester scores, the %time at pH\u003c4, and the numbers of reflux episodes and of long reflux episodes \u003e5 min were significantly higher in male patients than in female patients. (3) The %time at pH\u003c4 was much higher during upright periods than during supine periods. During supine periods, 31.86% (36/113) of GERD patients had delayed bolus clearance time, compared with 19.47% (22/113) during upright periods. (4) The number of abnormal DeMeester scores, %time at pH\u003c4, and the number of acid refluxes during upright periods were significantly higher in obese GERD patients than in GERD patients with a normal BMI. Overweight GERD patients also had many more acid refluxes during upright periods than GERD patients with a normal BMI.\nWeakly acidic refluxes were prevalent in Chinese GERD patients. The factors male, gender, upright position, obesity (BMIâ‰¥25), but not age, may increase the frequency and severity of GER.","title":"Reflux characteristics of 113 GERD patients with abnormal 24-h multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH tests.","pubmedId":"26365123"}
