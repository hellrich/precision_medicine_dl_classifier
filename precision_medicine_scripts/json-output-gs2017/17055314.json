Previous studies have clearly demonstrated the feasibility both regarding toxicities and resectability rates of the sequential and concurrent combination of radiation to chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant setting. However, induction chemoradiation has never been randomly compared to exclusive preoperative chemotherapy. Besides, the doses of radiation and the optimal drug combination remain undetermined at the time. Regarding the global therapeutic strategy of stage III non-small cell lung cancer, recently reported phase III trials evaluating the role of surgical resection after induction chemotherapy or chemoradiation, all showed the prognostic importance of the tumoral and mediastinal downstaging to select patients really benefiting from surgery. These developments make of the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer a model for multimodal therapeutic strategies combining chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.","title":"[Neoadjuvant chemoradiation in non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"17055314"}
