But, the clinical significance and functions of miRNA-203 in gastric cancer (GC) remain elusive.\nDecreased expression of miRNA-203 was correlated with tumor size, poor prognosis and recurrence in GC patients. Overexpression of miR-203 or knockdown of its target progesterone immunomodulatory binding factor 1 (PIBF1) inhibited GC growth in vitro and in vivo, while miR-203 knockdown promoted GC proliferation. In addition, PIBF1 overexpression attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-203 on GC growth and enhanced that effect on p-Akt expression.\nMiR-203 as a tumor biomarker suppresses GC growth through targeting the PIBF1/Akt signaling, suggesting that it may have the important therapeutic potential for the treatment of GC.","title":"MicroRNA-203 suppresses gastric cancer growth by targeting PIBF1/Akt signaling.","pubmedId":"26980572"}
