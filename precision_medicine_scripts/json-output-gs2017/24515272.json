Pretreatment prostate biopsies were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH for ERG rearrangement and overexpression, PTEN deletion, and expression loss. Univariable and multivariable Cox-regression analyses evaluated association of ERG and PTEN status with biochemical recurrence (BCR).\nWithin a median follow-up of 73 months, 11% of patients experienced BCR. Of 80 samples with both IHC and FISH performed for ERG, 46 (57.8%) demonstrated rearrangement by FISH and 45 (56.3%) by IHC. Of 77 samples with both IHC and FISH for PTEN, 14 (18.2%) had PTEN deletion by FISH and 22 (28.6%) by IHC. No significant associations were found between ERG, PTEN status, and clinicopathologic features. Patients with concurrent ERG rearrangement and PTEN deletion demonstrated significantly worse relapse-free survival rates compared with those with ERG or PTEN wild type (P \u003c 0.01). In multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for the effects of standard clinicopathologic features, combined ERG rearranged and PTEN deletion was independently associated with BCR (HR \u003d 2.6; P \u003d 0.02).\nConcurrent ERG rearrangement and PTEN loss was independently associated with time to BCR in patients undergoing brachytherapy. Future studies are needed to validate prostate cancer molecular subtyping for risk stratification.\nIdentifying patients in the ERG-rearranged/PTEN-deleted molecular subclass may improve treatment personalization.","title":"Recurrent prostate cancer genomic alterations predict response to brachytherapy treatment.","pubmedId":"24515272"}
