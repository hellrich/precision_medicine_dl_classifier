The role of KRAS mutation as a predictor of response to chemotherapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC is poorly understood.\nFrom a retrospective database of two university hospitals, all patients with advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC treated with first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy were selected. Mutation analysis for KRAS was performed and the relation with response to chemotherapy was assessed. Secondary endpoints were its relation with response to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\nA total of 161 patients, 94 men and 67 women, were included in this study. Median age was 60 years. The majority of patients (79%) had stage IV disease, of which 60 patients (37%) had a KRAS mutation. Patients with a KRAS mutation had a similar response to treatment as patients with KRAS wild-type (wt) (p \u003d 0.77). Median PFS in KRAS-mutated patients was 4.0 months versus 4.5 months in KRAS wt patients (hazard ratio \u003d 1.3; [95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.8]; p \u003d 0.16). Median OS in patients with KRAS mutation was 7.0 months versus 9.3 months in patients with KRAS wt (hazard ratio \u003d 1.2; [95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.7]; p \u003d 0.25). Type of KRAS mutation had no influence on response or outcome.\nOn the basis of our multicenter data presented here, we conclude that KRAS mutation is not predictive for worse response to chemotherapy, PFS, and OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy in first-line setting.","title":"KRAS mutations in advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy have no predictive value.","pubmedId":"23787801"}
