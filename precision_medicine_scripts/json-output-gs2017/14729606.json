Characterization of amplified regions of the genome in breast cancer has led to the identification of important oncogenes including erbB-2/HER-2, C-MYC, and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2. Chromosome 8p11-p12 is amplified in 10-15% of human breast cancers. The putative oncogene FGFR1 localizes to this region; however, we show evidence that FGFR inhibition fails to slow growth of three breast cancer cell lines with 8p11-p12 amplification. We present a detailed analysis of this amplicon in three human breast cancer cell lines using comparative genomic hybridization, traditional Southern and Northern analysis, and chromosome 8 cDNA microarray expression profiling. This study has identified new candidate oncogenes within the 8p11-p12 region, supporting the hypothesis that genes other than FGFR1 may contribute to oncogenesis in breast cancers with proximal 8p amplification.","title":"Genomic and expression analysis of the 8p11-12 amplicon in human breast cancer cell lines.","pubmedId":"14729606"}
