It is believed to play a role in angiogenesis, but in addition, recent data suggest that it can directly stimulate mitogenesis in some colon carcinoma cell lines. To clarify the role of bFGF in human colon carcinoma, we developed a model of Caco-2 which grew in serum-free conditions so that the effect of bFGF on multiplication, migration, and differentiation could be studied in defined conditions. Through morphological and biochemical studies in serum-free conditions, we demonstrated that this subline of Caco-2 differentiated spontaneously on reaching confluence. Using this model, we found that bFGF did not affect differentiation but that multiplication and migration were increased. The implication of these findings is that bFGF, released from the extracellular matrix by invading cells or produced by neovascular endothelial cells, can increase the mitogenic rate and migratory potential of colon carcinoma cells. In addition, the dual role of bFGF in stimulating colon carcinoma cells directly and promoting angiogenesis suggests that anti-bFGF strategies could form the basis of a novel approach to the treatment of colon carcinoma.","title":"Basic fibroblast growth factor increases the multiplication and migration of a serum-free derivative of CACO-2 but does not affect differentiation.","pubmedId":"7923221"}
