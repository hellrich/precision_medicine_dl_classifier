Recently, reciprocal activating mutations of NRAS and BRAF were found in benign melanocytic nevi and cutaneous melanomas. We had previously reported a similar epistatic relationship between activating NRAS mutations and inactivating PTEN/MMAC1 alterations. We thus hypothesized that BRAF and PTEN/MMAC1 mutations may cooperate to promote melanoma tumorigenesis. Overall, 40 of 47 (85%) melanoma cell lines and 11 of 16 (69%) uncultured melanoma metastases had mutations in NRAS, BRAF, or PTEN/MMAC1. NRAS was exclusively mutated in nine of 47 (19%) cell lines and two of 16 (13%) metastases, whereas BRAF was solely mutated in 28 of 47 (60%) cell lines and nine of 16 (56%) metastases. In the 12 of 15 melanoma cell lines (80%) and two of two melanoma metastases with PTEN alterations, BRAF was also mutated. These findings suggest the existence of possible cooperation between BRAF activation and PTEN loss in melanoma development.","title":"Genetic interaction between NRAS and BRAF mutations and PTEN/MMAC1 inactivation in melanoma.","pubmedId":"15009714"}
