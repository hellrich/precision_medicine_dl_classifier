One hundred patients were recruited, including controls with non-operated stomachs (duodenal ulcer or gastric cancer patients). In endoscopically taken biopsies glycogen was determined by the anthrone method. It was found that the glycogen content in the gastric remnants was higher than in non-operated stomachs and increased with the time after surgery. It is possible that the risk of gastric cancer, which increases with the time from surgery, may be related to glycogen storage.","title":"Glycogen content in the gastric mucosa of partially resected stomach; a possible relationship with the development of cancer.","pubmedId":"9619867"}
