The first among these agents to be approved for the treatment of NSCLC was gefitinib, a potent, selective and reversible inhibitor of HER1/EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. The review summarizes its clinical development and the new therapeutic options, with particular focus on predictive markers of susceptibility to this drug.","title":"Gefitinib in lung cancer therapy: clinical results, predictive markers of response and future perspectives.","pubmedId":"19182534"}
