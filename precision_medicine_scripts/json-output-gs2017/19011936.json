We have now investigated the frequency of these gene polymorphisms among colorectal cancer patients.\nA total of 157 colorectal cancer patients and 117 cancer-free healthy people were recruited at the Surgical Department of the Universit√§tsklinikum Mannheim. All patients and healthy people are Caucasians. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and gene polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).\nThe distribution of EGF 61 G/G homozygotes among colorectal cancer patients was more frequent than that in the control group (33.1% versus 11.1%; Odds Ratio [OR]\u003d3.962; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]\u003d2.036-7.708). The frequency of the \"G\" allele in the colorectal cancer patient group was also higher than that in the control group (51.3% versus 33.3%; OR\u003d2.105; 95% CI\u003d1.482-2.988). No difference could be found for the TGF-beta1 and VEGF genotypes among colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls.\nThe EGF 61 G/G genotype and the G allele are significantly related to colorectal cancer. The TGF-beta1 -509 T/C and VEGF 936 T/C gene polymorphisms are not related to colorectal cancer.","title":"Association between EGF, TGF-beta1, VEGF gene polymorphism and colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"19011936"}
