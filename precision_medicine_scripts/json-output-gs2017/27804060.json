In order to find out if the behavior pattern in families with a CDKN2A mutation is similar to what we previously have described in families with a BRCA1 mutation, we have studied the uptake of genetic services in probands and their relatives. We describe whether they attend genetic counseling when invited, whether they want a mutation test after being counseled and whether they adhere to recommendations for surveillance. 66 % (95/144) of first-degree relatives to mutation carriers contacted us within the study period. 98 % (126/128) of all relatives who came for genetic counseling decided on genetic testing for their family\u0027s mutation, and 93 % (66/71) of all mutation carriers wanted referral to yearly skin examinations. Female relatives had a significantly higher uptake of genetic services compared to males, similar to the findings in families with a BRCA1 mutation. Uptake of genetic services in general in families with a CDKN2A mutation is high. Females seem to have a higher interest in genetic testing than males, regardless of gene mutated.","title":"Uptake of genetic counseling, genetic testing and surveillance in hereditary malignant melanoma (CDKN2A) in Norway.","pubmedId":"27804060"}
