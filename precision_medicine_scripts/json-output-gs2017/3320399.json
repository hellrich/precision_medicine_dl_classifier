Histologically, the tumor uncovered was found to be a well differentiated adenocarcinoma and, as had been expected, in Dukes\u0027 A stage. An absolute curative operation was achieved. The operative procedure for juvenile rectal cancer must be planned to achieve both tumor removal and bodily function preservation to assure the best possible quality of postoperative life. We recommend intrarectal ultrasonography at the preoperative stage, the results to be used in deciding on the operative procedure.","title":"[Adenocarcinoma of an extraperitoneal rectum in a 17-year-old female].","pubmedId":"3320399"}
