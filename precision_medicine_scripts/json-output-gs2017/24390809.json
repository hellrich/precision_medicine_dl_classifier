The authors hypothesized that LRPPRC levels can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer.\nImmunochemistry analysis was performed to evaluate the levels of LRPPRC in 112 samples collected from patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) and 38 samples from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who were enrolled in hospitals in Guangzhou City, China and were followed for 10 years.\nSignificantly higher levels of LRPPRC were found in PCa samples compared with BPH samples. Greater than 75% of patients with PCa demonstrated high levels of LRPPRC whereas only 10% of patients with BPH were found to have similar levels of LRPPRC. The levels of LRPPRC were found to be positively correlated with tumor grade, metastasis, and serum prostate-specific antigen level, but were negatively correlated with hormone therapy sensitivity after 2 years of surgery and overall survival. The association between high levels of LRPPRC and late-stage PCa or hormone therapy insensitivity was confirmed in tissue samples collected from prostate-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)(-/-) mice or hormone-dependent and hormone-independent PCa cell lines.\nLRPPRC levels may be used as an independent biomarker for patients with PCa at a late stage with poor prognosis.","title":"Elevated levels of mitochondrion-associated autophagy inhibitor LRPPRC are associated with poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"24390809"}
