Since an activating mutation in KDR was identified in 70% of lung adenocarcinoma patients we sought to identify the number of available clinical trials targeting KDR in lung adenocarcinomas and/or solid tumors, thereby increasing therapeutic options and treatment accessibility for these patients.DNA from thirteen lung cancer FFPE samples was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 or MiSeq sequencers using a CLIA-certified 358-gene targeted sequencing assay. FASTQ files generated from Illumina\u0027s CASAVA software were submitted to a Clinical Genome Analytics (CGA) data analysis pipeline to perform automated read quality assessment, alignment, and variant calling. Clinical reports were written for each sample through extensive literature and clinicaltrials.gov searches.Thirteen lung biopsies were obtained and subdivided based on pathology reports, into 10 lung adenocarcinomas, 1 mixed NSCLC/SCLC, 1 small cell carcinoma, and 1 squamous carcinoma. KDR Q472H was identified in 7/10 lung adenocarcinomas and 1/1 mixed NSCLC/SCLC, but not in the small or squamous cell carcinomas. KDR encodes Vegfr-2, a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors. KDR Q472H is an activating missense mutation, which increases phosphorylation and activation of Vegfr-2, thereby promoting increased microvessel density in lung tumor tissues. At the time of clinical report writing, there were a total of 47 actively recruiting clinical trials targeting KDR and 4 trials requiring the patient to have a molecular alteration of KDR. Further breakdown of these trials identified the use of 33 off-label VEGFR inhibitors, 5 investigational pan-VEGFR inhibitors, and 5 investigational specific KDR (VEGFR2) inhibitors.Next-generation sequencing of 358 genes from lung cancer biopsies identified a common KDR activating mutation, Q472H, in 70% of lung adenocarcinomas. Searching clincialtrials.gov by pan-VEGFR and specific KDR inhibitors identified 47 actively recruiting trials, thus increasing the accessible repertoire of treatment options for lung adenocarcinoma patients.","title":"Targeting KDR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-73"}
