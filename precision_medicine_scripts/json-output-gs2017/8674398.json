However, some investigators have found that short-duration postprandial pH monitoring in the upright position is also useful, while others have failed to find such results. Therefore, we have compared a 6-hr period of pH monitoring (3-hr postprandial period after daytime meal and 3-hr supine period) with a total 24-hr period in detecting abnormal gastroesophageal reflux. Sixty-five patients (44 men, mean age 41.3 years) with GERD and 16 healthy volunteers (11 men, mean age 34.3 years) underwent 24-hr pH monitoring according to a standard protocol. Various reflux parameters during 24-hr pH monitoring were compared with reflux parameters during the 6-hr period. Abnormal GER was detected in 56 patients presenting with typical symptoms of GERD (sensitivity 86.2%). These patients could be further divided into upright (N \u003d 18), supine (N \u003d 15), and combined (N \u003d 23) refluxers, depending on the posture in which abnormal reflux occurred. Esophageal pH monitoring during the 3-hr postprandial upright period showed abnormal reflux in only 35 patients (sensitivity 53.8%; P \u003c 0.00005, compared with the 24-hr pH monitoring period). Abnormal GER was identified in 13 of 18 upright, 19 of 23 combined, and only one of 15 supine refluxers, as well as in two of nine patients with normal 24-hr pH-metry. However, inclusion of the 3-hr supine monitoring period in the 3-hr postprandial upright period improved detection of abnormal GER to 78.5% (51 patients; P \u003d NS compared with 24-hr pH monitoring period). This was related mainly to improved detection of abnormal GER in supine refluxers (11 of 15; 73.3%). Esophageal acid exposure time correlated significantly with severity of esophagitis only during the total and supine periods of both the 24- and 6-hr periods and not during the upright period. Esophageal acid clearance correlated significantly with increasing grades of esophagitis for the supine and total periods only. We conclude that 3-hr postprandial pH monitoring, as has been conventionally practiced, is not appropriate in the detection of abnormal GER; inclusion of a supine period in the short-duration pH monitoring schedule increases the detection of pathological reflux. We therefore recommend that a supine period should be included in short-duration pH monitoring schedules. We also found that supine reflex was the most important factor in the development of esophagitis.","title":"Inclusion of supine period in short-duration pH monitoring is essential in diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease.","pubmedId":"8674398"}
