The major toxicities of irinotecan are neutropenia and diarrhea, although there is interpatient variability in the severity of symptoms. The combination of irinotecan and cisplatin is likewise significantly active against SCLC, with an acceptable toxicity profile. A phase III study comparing irinotecan and cisplatin with etoposide and cisplatin has been conducted in the treatment of previously untreated patients with extensive disease SCLC. The results of this study may define a new standard care for SCLC. Irinotecan and etoposide is also an active new combination in the treatment of both previously treated or untreated SCLC. Neutropenia was the most commonly observed toxicity in this combination; there were no severe gastrointestinal toxicities, including diarrhea.","title":"Irinotecan in small-cell lung cancer--Japanese trials.","pubmedId":"10981292"}
