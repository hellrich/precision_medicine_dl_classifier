Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated by Ï‡(2) test to estimate the significance difference of genotype and allele frequencies in case and control groups. ORs and 95% CIs were adjusted by logistic regression analysis with age, gender, drinking and smoking. The genotypes distributions of control group were tested by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).\nThe genotypes frequencies of controls for rs6965469 and rs763317 polymorphims were consistent with HWE. The distribution of rs6965469 TT genotype in two groups was significantly different (P\u003c0.05) and TT genotype was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (OR\u003d6.92, 95% CI\u003d1.33-36.00). AA genotype and A allele of rs763317 were also the susceptible factors of lung cancer. Individuals with AA genotype or A allele were more likely to suffer lung cancer (AA vs. GG: OR\u003d7.20, 95% CI\u003d1.33-39.07; A vs. G: OR\u003d2.61, 95% CI\u003d1.04-6.59).\nThe EGFR rs6965469 and rs763317 polymorphisms may be risk factors for lung cancer.","title":"Association between EGFR polymorphisms and the risk of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26823874"}
