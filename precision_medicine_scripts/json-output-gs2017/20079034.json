The following clinical parameters were recorded and compared, including operative time, blood loss, intraoperative and postoperative complications, the changes of hemoglobin before and after surgery, postoperative temperature, the time of postoperative anus exhaust and urination, hospitalization, pathologic exam, and the number of lymph nodes.\nLaparoscopically robotic assisted radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed successfully on those 5 patients without the conversion to laparotomy. No intraoperative and postoperative complications were observed. The operative time were 305, 365, 275, 240 and 245 minutes, respectively, with a mean value of 286 minutes. Estimated blood loss was 200, 400, 650, 300 and 400 ml, respectively. The mean blood loss was 390 ml. Temperatures of all patients were not higher than 37.5 degrees C and anus exhaust was recovered at 36 hours after surgery. Those five patients were hospitalized for 11, 13, 9, 12 and 12 days respectively. Squamous carcinoma of cervix were diagnosed by the pathologic examination. The resected margin of vagina and parametrium was clear. The numbers of pelvic lymph nodes were 14, 22, 16, 21 and 18, respectively. No evidence of lymph nodes metastasis was found.\nLaparoscopically robotic assisted radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy is feasible as a novel approach in the treatment of cervical cancer.","title":"[Preliminary study on laparoscopically robotic assisted radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy on cervical cancer.].","pubmedId":"20079034"}
