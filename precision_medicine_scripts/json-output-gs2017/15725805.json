We studied the expression of cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 17 (CK17), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), CDX2, mucin 1 (MUC1), mucin 2 (MUC2), and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) in 46 cases of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, 18 ampulla of Vater adenocarcinomas, and 24 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. The expression of MUC1 and CK17 was restricted to pancreatic ductal carcinoma (41 of 46, 89%; 38 of 46, 83%, respectively), the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin (6 of 6, 100%; 5 of 6, 83%, respectively), and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (20 of 24, 83%; 17 of 24, 71%, respectively). More than 50% of cases of pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas showed diffuse cytoplasmic CK17 positivity. In contrast, less than 5% cases (8 of 184) of extra-pancreatobiliary nonmucinous adenocarcinomas expressed CK17, and only 3 of them showed diffuse CK17 positivity. The expression of MUC2 and CDX2 was restricted to the intestinal, mucinous, and signet-ring cell-type adenocarcinomas of duodenal papillary origin (9 of 11, 82%; 11 of 11, 100%, respectively). MUC2 was rarely expressed in pancreatic ductal carcinoma (1 of 46, 2%) and was negative in the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin and in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. A heterogeneous CDX2 staining pattern was seen in 1 of 6 cases of the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin (17%), 5 of 24 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (21%), and 10 of 46 (22%) pancreatic ductal carcinomas. In contrast, all 11 cases of the intestinal, mucinous, and signet-ring cell-type adenocarcinomas of duodenal papillary origin showed homogeneous CDX2 nuclear positivity. We concluded that CK17 is a useful marker in separating pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas from extra-pancreatobiliary nonmucinous adenocarcinomas, including adenocarcinomas from the colon, breast, gynecologic organs, stomach, lung, prostate, thyroid, kidney, and adrenal gland, and malignant mesothelioma. MUC1+/CK17+ can be used as positive markers for pancreatic ductal carcinomas, the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin, and cholangiocarcinomas with positive predictive values of 76%, 83%, and 58%, respectively. MUC2+/CDX2+ can be used as positive markers for the intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of duodenal papillary origin with a positive predictive value of 82%.","title":"Immunohistochemical staining in the diagnosis of pancreatobiliary and ampulla of Vater adenocarcinoma: application of CDX2, CK17, MUC1, and MUC2.","pubmedId":"15725805"}
