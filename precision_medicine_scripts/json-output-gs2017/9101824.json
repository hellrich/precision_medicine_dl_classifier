The most important factor influencing the survival rate is the extent of the lymph node dissection. The histopathological investigation of our pancreatoduodenectomy specimens demonstrates clearly that local excision of ampullary cancer may be indicated only in high risk patients with a pT1, well-differentiated tumor smaller than 0.6 cm in diameter.","title":"[Extent of radical surgery in carcinoma of Vater\u0027s ampulla].","pubmedId":"9101824"}
