The purpose of the study is to perform correlation of FAK expression with patient prognostic factors using tissue microarrays (TMA) samples.\nWe analyzed FAK expression by immunohistochemical staining in 196 breast primary tumor samples from stage II-IV patients and in 117 metastatic tissues matched to the primary tumors using TMA that were stained with FAK monoclonal antibody.\nHigh FAK expression in primary tumors was associated with a younger age of patients (p \u003d 0.033), lymphovascular invasion (p \u003d 0.001) and with the triple-negative phenotype (p \u003d 0.033). FAK expression in 117 metastatic tissues positively correlated with FAK expression in matched primary tumors by Spearman correlation analysis. In addition, a strong positive correlation was observed between high FAK expression and shorter overall survival and progression free survival in patients with metastatic tumors.\nThe data demonstrate a high potential for FAK as a therapeutic target, especially in triple-negative breast cancer patients with high FAK expression.","title":"High focal adhesion kinase expression in breast carcinoma is associated with lymphovascular invasion and triple-negative phenotype.","pubmedId":"25326692"}
