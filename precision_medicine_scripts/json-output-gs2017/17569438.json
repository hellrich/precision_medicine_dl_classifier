Computed tomography showed a large intraabdominal mass. In the differential diagnosis a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or a metastasis of an unknown primary neoplasia were considered. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).","title":"[Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): imaging findings and differential diagnosis].","pubmedId":"17569438"}
