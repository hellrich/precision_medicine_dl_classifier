E-3810 (Cancer Res. 2011 in press) is a novel dual-targeted small molecule inhibitor of VEGFR1, 2, 3 and FGFR1 showing strong anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity in preclinical models at well-tolerated oral doses, with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and potential for use in combination.  Methods:  A first-in-man, phase I dose escalation study is ongoing in patients with advanced solid tumors and no established therapeutic options to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodinamics of E-3810 given orally, once daily for a 4-week course. Treatment can continue without interval until progression based on overall clinical benefit. We use a standard 3+3 MTD design, starting from 5 mg (1/12 of monkey MTD) and up to the MTD based on DLTs in the initial cycle. Dose is doubled till the first instance of G2 drug-related toxicity or G2 uncontrolled hypertension, with smaller increments thereafter. The MTD is the level where  2/6 patients suffer a DLT, the next lower level being the recommended dose (RD). An expansion basket phase is planned at the RD, in patients who could benefit from E-3810, i.e. with tumors sensitive to anti-angiogenic therapy and failing a prior anti-angiogenic regimen, or breast cancer with FGFR1 amplification, to identify indications for further development. PK after single and repeated administration is evaluated by a validated LC-MS/MS method. Correlative studies (baseline, days 7 and 28) include: (i) quantitative assessment of the effects of E-3810 on tumor vasculature by DCE-MRI and DCE-US imaging; (ii) assay of angiogenesis biomarkers i.e. soluble VEGFR2, VEGFR1, VEGF, bFGF, Collagen IV (by ELISA) and  circulating endothelial and progenitors cells (CEC and CEP, by flow cytometry). Tumor response is based on imaging according to RECIST; circulating tumor cells (CTC) are measured by the immunomagnetic CellSearch method.    Recruitment started in July 2010; the dose escalation phase is ongoing with 10 patients enrolled as of January 2011. No DLT has been observed up to 20 mg.","title":"First-in-man study of E-3810, a novel VEGFR and FGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_81321-102"}
