Previously we have shown that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4) gene therapy increased apoptosis and decreased mitosis in colon cancer. In this experiment we used HT-29 colon cancer cells to induce subcutaneous cancers in nude mice and administered either the mammalian expression vector with IGFBP-4 insert or vector only around the tumour site. Three weeks after gene transfer, tumours were harvested and expressions of Bax, Bcl-2 and IGF-I receptor in tumours were determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Micro-vessel counting was performed by immunostaining with CD34 and von Willebrand antibodies. Results showed that tumours treated with IGFBP-4 gene had higher expression of Bax, lower expression of Bcl-2 and IGF-I receptor. Bcl-2 was localised to tumour cell cytoplasm while Bax was expressed both in the interstitial area and cytoplasm. IGFBP-4 treatment also decreased micro-vessel count in tumour tissues. Micro-vessels were mainly located in the periphery and interstitial area. This experiment shows that IGFBP-4 gene therapy increases tumour apoptosis via altering the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax and decreasing the angiogenesis in colorectal cancer.","title":"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4 gene therapy increases apoptosis by altering Bcl-2 and Bax proteins and decreases angiogenesis in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"17332927"}
