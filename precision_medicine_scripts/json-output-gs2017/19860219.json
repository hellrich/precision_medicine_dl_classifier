Regular examination is essential for the prevention of cervical cancer. Two problems have been pointed out regarding cervical cancer examination in Japan: low rates of participation in the examination, and the accuracy of cytological diagnoses. If HPV testing is conducted in combination with cytological diagnoses performed at present, it is estimated that higher levels of screening accuracy will be achieved, and almost 100% of cervical cancer will be detected as a precancerous lesion. Moreover, an HPV vaccine was developed. The incidence of cervical cancer is expected to decrease almost to zero in the near future because of increased awareness of HPV vaccination and cancer screening including HPV testing. In this symposium, four specialists will give lectures on present cervical cancer examinations, including methods for the cytological diagnosis and reporting forms, and their problems. We will also discuss prospects in HPV testing and cervical cancer examination.","title":"[HPV and cervical cancer examination--prospects in cervical cancer examination].","pubmedId":"19860219"}
