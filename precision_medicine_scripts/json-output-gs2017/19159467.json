Recent advances in cancer biology have led to the identification of new targets in neoplastic cells and the development of novel targeted therapies. At this time, two targeted agents are approved by the FDA in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib, and the anitangiogenic bevacizumab. A third agent, cetuximab, which was recently shown to enhance survival when used with cisplatin and vinorelbine as first line therapy for advanced NSCLC, will likely be approved by regulatory agencies. With more than 500 molecularly targeted agents under development, the prospects of identifying novel therapies that benefit individual patients with lung cancer are bright.","title":"Recent advances of novel targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"19159467"}
