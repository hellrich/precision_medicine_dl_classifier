The role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is poorly defined in NF2, and although the procedure has excellent control rates in the non-NF2 population, its utility has been questioned because radiation has been hypothesized to predispose patients to malignant transformation of benign tumors. To the authors\u0027 knowledge, this is the first study to examine the use of SRS specifically for meningiomas in patients with NF2.\nThe authors searched a tumor registry for all patients with NF2 who had undergone Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for meningioma in the period from January 1, 1999, to September 19, 2013, at a single tertiary care cancer center. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for patient and tumor characteristics and outcomes.\nAmong the 12 patients who met the search criteria, 125 meningiomas were identified, 87 (70%) of which were symptomatic or progressive and thus treated with GKRS. The median age at the first GKRS was 31 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27-37 years). Five patients (42%) had multiple treatments with a median of 27 months (IQR 14-50 months) until the subsequent GKRS. The median follow-up in surviving patients was 43 months (IQR 34-110 months). The 5-year local tumor control and distant treatment failure rates were 92% and 77%, respectively. Toxicities occurred in 25% of the GKRS treatments, although the majority were Grade 1 or 2. At the last follow-up, 4 patients (33%) had died a neurological death at a median age of 39 years (IQR 37-46 years), and their cases accounted for 45% of all tumors, 55% of all treated tumors, and 58% of all GKRSs. Univariate analysis revealed several predictive variables for distant failure, including male sex (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.086-0.92, p \u003d 0.036), age at distant failure (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.90-0.95, p \u003c 0.0001), and prior number of GKRS treatments (HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4, p \u003d 0.0049). Local failure, maximum size of the treated tumor, delivered tumor margin dose, and WHO grade were not significant. On multivariate analysis, age at distant failure (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.95, p \u003c 0.0001) and prior number of GKRSs (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p \u003d 0.004) remained significant. No malignant transformation events among treated tumors were observed.\nRadiosurgery represents a feasible modality with minimal toxicity for NF2-associated meningiomas. Increasing patient age was associated with a decreased rate of distant failure, whereas an increasing number of prior GKRS treatments predicted distant failure. Further studies are necessary to determine the long-term patterns of treatment failure in these patients.","title":"Gamma Knife radiosurgery for meningiomas in patients with neurofibromatosis Type 2.","pubmedId":"25555193"}
