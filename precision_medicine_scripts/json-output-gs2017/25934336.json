Efficient control of cancer growth may substantially improve the survival of PDAC patients. However, no efficient treatments are so far available. Here, we inhibited transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptor signaling by overexpression of a key inhibitor of this pathway, SMAD7, in the mouse pancreas, using a recently developed intraductal infusion method. Overexpression of SMAD7 significantly increased growth of both implanted PDAC and PDAC by K-ras modification. Our data thus suggest that TGFβ receptor signaling restrains growth of PDAC, and modulation of TGFβ receptor signaling may be an effective treatment for PDAC.","title":"Transforming growth factor β receptor signaling restrains growth of pancreatic carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"25934336"}
