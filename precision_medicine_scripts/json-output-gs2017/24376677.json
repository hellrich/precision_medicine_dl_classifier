However, a subset of this population doesn\u0027t respond to EGFR-TKI treatment. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate survival outcome in NSCLC EGFR-mutant patients who were treated with EGFR TKIs.\nAmong the 580 consecutive NSCLC patients who were treated at our facility between 2008 and 2012, a total of 124 treatment-naïve, advanced NSCLC, EGFR-mutant patients treated with EGFR TKIs were identified and grouped into non-responders and responders for analyses.\nOf 124 patients, 104 (84%) responded to treatment, and 20 (16%) did not; and the overall median PFS was 9.0 months. Notably, the PFS, overall survival (OS) and survival rates were significantly unfavorable in non-responders (1.8 vs. 10.3 months, hazard ratio (HR) \u003d 29.2, 95% confidence interval (CI), 13.48-63.26, P\u003c0.0001; 9.4 vs. 17.3 months, HR \u003d 2.74, 95% CI, 1.52-4.94, P \u003d 0.0008; and 58% vs. 82% in 6, 37% vs. 60% in 12, and 19 vs. 40% at 24 months, respectively). In multivariate analysis, treatment efficacy strongly affected PFS and OS, independent of covariates (HR \u003d 47.22, 95% CI, 17.88-124.73, P\u003c0.001 and HR \u003d 2.74, 95% CI, 1.43-5.24, P \u003d 0.002, respectively). However, none of the covariates except of the presence of EGFR exon 19 deletion in the tumors was significantly associated with better treatment efficacy.\nA subset of NSCLC EGFR-mutant patients displayed unfavorable survival despite EGFR TKI administration. This observation reinforces the urgent need for biomarkers effectively predicting the non-responders and for drug development overcoming primary resistance to EGFR TKIs. In addition, optimal therapeutic strategies to prolong the survival of non-responders need to be investigated.","title":"Distinct clinical outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors: non-responders versus responders.","pubmedId":"24376677"}
