The tumors express the cell surface transmembrane receptor KIT that has a tyrosine kinase activity and is a protein product of KIT protoeoncogene. These tumors occur in the whole of Gastrointestinal tract. Treatment includes surgical resection for localized tumors. For metastatic disease treatment options include systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, with a response rate of less than 10%. Presently Imatinib; a tyrosine kinase inhibitor has shown promising result with response rates upto 59-69% in phase II results in metastatic setting; and ongoing phase II \u0026 phase III trials in adjuvant setting will help to establish its role as an adjuvant to surgery. We have treated eleven patients of metastatic GIST with Imatinib and we hereby present these cases.","title":"Imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"15656032"}
