Current guidelines stratify treatment recommendations based on life expectancy; therefore, accurate determination of life expectancy is essential. Evidence shows that patient-related factors, including age, comorbidities, and functional status, are critical determinants of life expectancy. Equally strong evidence supports tumor-related factors, including Gleason score, tumor stage, and prostate-specific antigen, and efficacy of treatment. Currently, no available tools comprehensively consider all pertinent factors in determining life expectancy.","title":"Counterpoint: prostate cancer life expectancy can not be accurately predicted from currently available tools.","pubmedId":"17692176"}
