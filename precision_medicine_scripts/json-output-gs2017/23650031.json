In order to understand the behavior of HM781-36B in vitro and in vivo we validated an analytical method for HM781-36B and its major metabolites in plasma.\nIn vivo and in vitro metabolism of HM781-36B was studied in dog plasma, urine and feces as well as using human and dog liver microsomes with extraction by ethyl acetate or methyl tert-butyl ether, respectively, and successfully separated by high-performance liquid chromatography diode-array detection mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD/MS). Ten metabolites were identified by LC/ESI-ion trap mass spectrometry (MS, MS(2) , MS(3) and MRM) and LC/Q-TOF-MS/MS for exact mass measurement. For accurate characterization of the major metabolites, authentic standards (M1, M2, M4, and M10) were synthesized.\nTen metabolites of HM781-36B in an in vitro mixture were separated and identified by LC/ESI-MS(n) . The MS/MS spectral patterns of the parent drug and metabolites exhibited two characteristic ions (A- and B-type ions) attributed to the cleavage of the ether bond between the piperidine ring and the quinazoline ring, providing important information on the site of chemical conversion during the metabolism. Six hydroxylated derivatives including dehalogenation and demethylation, two N-oxide forms, a demethylated form and de-acryloylpiperideine metabolites were observed.\nThe LC/ESI-ion trap MS(n) technique was effective in obtaining structural information and yielded diagnostic ions for the identification of diverse metabolites. The multiple metabolic pathways of HM781-36B were suggested in in vitro and in vivo samples and the dihydroxylation (M1) and demethylation (M2) appeared to be the major metabolites.","title":"Metabolite identification of a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor, HM781-36B, and a pharmacokinetic study by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.","pubmedId":"23650031"}
