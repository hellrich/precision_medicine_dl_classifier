Bronchological methods and bioptic measurements take the first place in the diagnosis of bronchial carcinoma. With these methods an exact localization of tumour growth in the bronchial system, collection of specimens from the tumour for histological and cytological examinations, and the examination of the bronchial system with regard to the local operability are possible. The bronchological technique using rigid and flexible instruments allows an exact inspection of all bronchial parts down to the bronchi of the 5th generation. With supplementary equipment peripheral tumours are also attainable. The value of bronchological and bioptic methods are critically represented.","title":"[The importance of bronchologic procedures in the diagnosis of bronchial carcinoma].","pubmedId":"2688594"}
