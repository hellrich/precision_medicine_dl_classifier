Colonic drug delivery has gained increased importance not just for the delivery of the drugs for the treatment of local diseases associated with the colon but also for its potential for the delivery of proteins and therapeutic peptides. To achieve successful colonic delivery, a drug needs to be protected from absorption and /or the environment of the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and then be abruptly released into the proximal colon, which is considered the optimum site for colon-targeted delivery of drugs. Colon targeting is naturally of value for the topical treatment of diseases of colon such as Chron\u0027s diseases, ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer and amebiasis. Peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides and vaccines pose potential candidature for colon targeted drug delivery.\nThe various strategies for targeting orally administered drugs to the colon include covalent linkage of a drug with a carrier, coating with pH-sensitive polymers, formulation of timed released systems, exploitation of carriers that are degraded specifically by colonic bacteria, bioadhesive systems and osmotic controlled drug delivery systems. Various prodrugs (sulfasalazine, ipsalazine, balsalazine and olsalazine) have been developed that are aimed to deliver 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) for localized chemotherapy of inflammatory bowl disease (IBD). Microbially degradable polymers especially azo crosslinked polymers have been investigated for use in targeting of drugs to colon. Certain plant polysaccharides such as amylose, inulin, pectin and guar gum remains unaffected in the presence of gastrointestinal enzymes and pave the way for the formulation of colon targeted drug delivery systems. The concept of using pH as a rigger to release a drug in the colon is based on the pH conditions that vary continuously down the gastrointestinal tract. Times dependent drug delivery systems have been developed that are based on the principle to prevent release of drug until 3-4 h after leaving the stomach. Redox sensitive polymers and bioadhesive systems have also been exploited to deliver the drugs into the colon.\nThe approach that is based on the formation of prodrug involves covalent linkage between drug and carrier. The type of linkage that is formed between drug and carrier would decide the triggering mechanism for the release of drug in colon. The presence of azo reductase enzymes play pivotal role in the release of drug from azo bond prodrugs while glycosidase activity of the colonic microflora is responsible for liberation of drugs from glycosidic prodrugs. Release of drugs from azo polymer coated dosage forms is supposed to take place after reduction and thus cleavage of the azo bonds by the azoreductase enzymes present in the colonic microflora. Natural polysaccharides have been used as tools to deliver the drugs specifically to the colon. These polysaccharides remain intact in the physiological environment of stomach and small intestine but once the dosage form enters into colon, it is acted upon by polysaccharidases, which degrades the polysaccharide and releases the drug into the vicinity of bioenvironment of colon. However, they should be protected while gaining entry into stomach and small intestine due to enormous swelling and hydrophilic properties of polysaccharides. This has been achieved either by chemical crosslinking or by addition of a protective coat. Formulation coated with enteric polymers releases drug when pH move towards alkaline range while as the multicoated formulation passes the stomach, the drug is released after a lag time of 3-5 h that is equivalent to small intestinal transit time. Drug coated with a bioadhesive polymer that selectively provides adhesion to the colonic mucosa may release drug in the colon.\nImproved drug delivery systems are required for drugs currently in use to treat localized diseases of the colon. The advantages of targeting drugs specifically to the diseased colon are reduced incidence of systemic side effects, lower dose of drug, supply of the drug to the biophase only when it is required and maintenance of the drug in its intact form as close as possible to the target site.","title":"Pharmaceutical approaches to colon targeted drug delivery systems.","pubmedId":"12753729"}
