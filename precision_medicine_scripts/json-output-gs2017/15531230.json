Patients with ampulla of Vater and distal common bile duct adenocarcinoma indicate a much more favorable prognosis. Controversy exists as to whether adjuvant therapy could improve the outcome in these patients after resection. The aim of the present study was to analyze the pattern of recurrence in patients with periampullary adenocarcinoma after pancreatoduodenectomy. Between January 1992 and December 2002, all patients with an R0 resection were identified and used for this analysis. A total of 190 patients underwent a microscopically radical resection and received no adjuvant therapy. Of those, 72 patients were diagnosed with pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma, 86 patients were diagnosed with ampulla of Vater adenocarcinoma, and 31 patients were diagnosed with distal common bile duct adenocarcinoma. Recurrent disease was indicated in 81% of the patients with pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma, 50% of the patients with ampulla of Vater adenocarcinoma, and in 74% of the patients with bile duct adenocarcinoma. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymph node metastases were prognostic for recurrent disease in patients with pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (P \u003d 0.038). The depth of invasion (T4, P \u003c 0.032) and lymph node metastases (P \u003c 0.001) were prognostic in patients with ampulla of Vater adenocarcinoma. Poor tumor differentiation (P \u003c 0.001) was prognostic in patients with distal bile duct adenocarcinoma. Selected patients with periampullary malignancies exhibited a high recurrence rate and should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials for adjuvant treatment including local therapy (radiotherapy) according to the identified prognostic factors.","title":"Recurrent disease after microscopically radical (R0) resection of periampullary adenocarcinoma in patients without adjuvant therapy.","pubmedId":"15531230"}
