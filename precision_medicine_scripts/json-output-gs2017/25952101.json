Different techniques are routinely used to determine BRAF status in clinical samples. However, low tumor cellularity and tumor heterogeneity can affect the sensitivity of somatic mutation detection. Digital PCR (dPCR) is a next-generation genotyping method that clonally amplifies nucleic acids and allows the detection and quantification of rare mutations. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical routine performance of a new dPCR-based test to detect and quantify BRAF mutation load in 47 paraffin-embedded cutaneous melanoma biopsies. We compared the results obtained by dPCR with high-resolution melting curve analysis and pyrosequencing or with one of the allele-specific PCR methods available on the market. dPCR showed the lowest limit of detection. dPCR and allele-specific amplification detected the highest number of mutated samples. For the BRAF mutation load quantification both dPCR and pyrosequencing gave similar results with strong disparities in allele frequencies in the 47 tumor samples under study (from 0.7% to 79% of BRAF V600E mutations/sample). In conclusion, the four methods showed a high degree of concordance. dPCR was the more-sensitive method to reliably and easily detect mutations. Both pyrosequencing and dPCR could quantify the mutation load in heterogeneous tumor samples.
