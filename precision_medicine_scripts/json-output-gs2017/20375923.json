Incidence and mortality, as well as rates of increase, have been significantly higher in elderly people compared with younger age groups. Lower survival rates from CM among elderly are mainly the result of late diagnosis of tumors with dismal prognostic features. Expansion of current preventive strategies to include older age groups is therefore warranted. Despite differences in clinical presentation and pathological characteristics of CM in the elderly, there is no evidence that primary surgical treatment should differ from that proposed generally for melanoma. However, the rate of positive sentinel node dissection decreases with age, even though overall survival is shorter in older patients, a paradox that remains to be explained. The use of adjuvant treatment with interferon-alpha in elderly patients requires careful discussion of the risks and benefits, especially when serious illness coexists. For metastatic melanoma, complete metastasectomy is the only treatment associated with benefit for overall survival. However, careful selection of surgical oncogeriatric candidates is necessary, probably with the use of tools to provide a comprehensive geriatric assessment, to identify patients more likely to benefit from this treatment. In the absence of any effective systemic treatment for disseminated CM, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Practical means to improve accrual of older patients in clinical trials are necessary to provide better evidence for their treatment.","title":"Cutaneous melanoma in the elderly: epidemiology, prognosis and treatment.","pubmedId":"20375923"}
