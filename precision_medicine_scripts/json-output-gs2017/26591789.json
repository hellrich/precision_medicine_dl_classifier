Increased tobacco use in women causes a higher incidence of both lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The end of the hormonal substitution, since it was identified as increasing breast cancer risk, has produced a decreased incidence of the later, while cardiovascular diseases keep increasing after menopausal. These examples highlight the necessity of medical studies taking into consideration women specificities, as well as of an individual weighting of risk factors by physicians.","title":"[Causes of death in woman, between heart and cancer].","pubmedId":"26591789"}
