In many types of cancer, alterations of Cdkn2a abrogate the functions of both suppressors, implying that both are integral to the genesis of certain cancer types. While this has been observed in mouse lung adenocarcinogenesis, recent observations also suggested that naturally occurring variation at the Cdkn2a locus is probably operative in the development of these tumors. Firstly, two common haplotypes of mouse Cdkn2a have been identified, each of which encodes cosegregating variants of p16INK4a and p19ARF. The p16INK4a variants differ at amino acids 18 (histidine or proline) and 51 (valine or isoleucine), whereas the p19ARF variants differ only at amino acid 72 (histidine or arginine). Secondly, genetic resistance to lung tumor formation appears to segregate with one particular haplotype, which also is deleted preferentially in lung adenocarcinomas of Cdkn2a heterozygous mice. Here we attempt to explain these observations and to characterize further the roles of p16INK4 and p19ARF in mouse lung tumorigenesis by examining the function and expression of each of the variants of Cdkn2a. Functional analysis showed that the proline 18/isoleucine 51 p16INK4a variant was diminished in cdk6 binding, cdk6 inhibition and NIH/3T3 fibroblast growth suppression compared with the histidine 18/valine 51 variant, whereas both of the p19ARF variants suppressed growth with similar potencies. Also, the different alleles for p16INK4a and p19ARF were transcribed equally in the normal lungs of Cdkn2a heterozygotes, as determined by comparative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis. These results indicate that strain-specific variation in p16INK4a function is exploited in mouse lung tumorigenesis and strongly implicate a role for p16INK4a in lung cancer predisposition and development.","title":"Cdkn2a encodes functional variation of p16INK4a but not p19ARF, which confers selection in mouse lung tumorigenesis.","pubmedId":"10365910"}
