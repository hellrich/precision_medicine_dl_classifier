Additionally, current post-operative surveillance methods including tumor marker CA19-9, clinical symptoms, and CT scans lack sensitivity and specificity for early recurrence. Hence, a practical, blood-based biomarker that could identify cancer at an earlier time point, and prompt a change in management, would be clinically important.  Methods:  Using a highly sensitive digital DNA quantification approach, we measured KRAS mutation-associated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the archived sera of 46 resected pancreas adenocarcinoma patients taken 8-10 weeks post-operatively, after confirming the mutational presence in the primary tumor. Approximately 10 years of patient data were available from chart review and clinical databases to assess disease recurrence. A mutant allele fraction \u003e 0.02% was considered positive.  Results:  In a subgroup analysis, patients whose tumor had a p.G12V KRAS mutation and who did not have detectable levels of ctDNA had significantly longer time to disease recurrence than did patients with detectable ctDNA (p \u003d 0.02; CI 1.037 to 12.77). Amongst patients whose tumor harbored a p.G12R KRAS mutation, those with undetectable ctDNA also had significant longer time to disease recurrence as compared to those with detectable ctDNA (p \u003d 0.01; CI 1.241 to 36.99). In combination, 14 of the total 46 patients who had undetectable ctDNA following their resection trended, though statistically insignificant, towards longer time to disease recurrence (median time 545 to 471 days; HR \u003d 0.58; p \u003d 0.3) including 3 ctDNA-negative patients who still remain disease free.  Conclusions:  This retrospective analysis demonstrates that ctDNA can be detected in peripheral blood, and may be a valuable clinical marker for specific tumor mutations. Additional larger, prospective studies are needed to validate the clinical utility as a prognostic biomarker for recurrence in resected pancreas cancer.","title":"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a prognostic marker for recurrence in resected pancreas cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_144379-156"}
