Here, we focus on ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), an mTOR effector not implicated previously in cancer. Phosphorylation of rpS6 was increased in pancreatic acinar cells upon implantation of the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) or transgenic expression of mutant Kras. To examine the functional significance of rpS6 phosphorylation, we used knockin mice lacking all five phosphorylatable sites in rpS6 (termed rpS6(P-/-) mice). Strikingly, the development of pancreatic cancer precursor lesions induced by either DMBA or mutant Kras was greatly reduced in rpS6(P-/-) mice. The rpS6 mutants expressing oncogenic Kras showed increased p53 along with increased staining of γ-H2AX and 53bp1 (Trp53bp1) in areas of acinar ductal metaplasia, suggesting that rpS6 phosphorylation attenuates Kras-induced DNA damage and p53-mediated tumor suppression. These results reveal that rpS6 phosphorylation is important for the initiation of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 attenuates DNA damage and tumor suppression during development of pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"23361300"}
