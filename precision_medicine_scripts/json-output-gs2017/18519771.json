Although the presence of dMMR seems to be a favorable prognostic marker, data suggest that these patients do not respond as well to adjuvant chemotherapy.\nIn this study, we examined the prognostic significance of tumor MMR deficiency and the presence of a specific mutation in BRAF (V600E) in a group of patients (n \u003d 533) who participated in a randomized prospective clinical trial through the North Central Cancer Treatment Group.\nTumors with dMMR were found to be associated with higher tumor grade (P \u003d 0.001), proximal location (P \u003c 0.0001), and improved overall and disease-free survival (P \u003d 0.05 and 0.04, respectively). Among all cases examined, evaluation of the BRAF V600E mutation status revealed no statistically significant differences in either disease-free or overall survival. Patients were then grouped into four categories for further analysis: dMMR/BRAF(-), dMMR/BRAF(+), pMMR/BRAF(-), and pMMR/BRAF(+). The dMMR/BRAF(-) group had a significantly improved overall survival (5-year overall survival of 100% versus 73%, P \u003d 0.002) compared with all others. The remaining three groups had very similar survival outcomes. An additional cohort of tumors previously classified as having dMMR were also tested for the BRAF V600E alteration. Results remained significant (P \u003d 0.006) when the two groups were combined for analysis.\nOverall, these data suggest that the underlying molecular etiology of those tumors having dMMR may influence the disease outcome in these patients.","title":"Prognostic significance of defective mismatch repair and BRAF V600E in patients with colon cancer.","pubmedId":"18519771"}
