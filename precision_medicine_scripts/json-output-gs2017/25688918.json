In univariate analyses, overall survival (OS) was influenced by thoracic nodal status (median OS: 98 months for pN-, 27 months for pN+, P\u003c0.0001), multiple thoracic metastases (75 months vs 101 months, P\u003d0.008) or a history of liver metastases (94 months vs 101 months, P\u003d0.04). mBRAF had a significantly worse OS than mKRAS and wild type (WT) (P\u003c0.0001). The 5-year OS was 0% for mBRAF, 44% for mKRAS and 100% for WT, with corresponding median OS of 15, 55 and 98 months, respectively (P\u003c0.0001). In multivariate analysis, WT BRAF (HR: 0.005 (95% CI: 0.001-0.02), P\u003c0.0001) and WT KRAS (HR: 0.04 (95% CI: 0.02-0.1), P\u003c0.0001) had a significant impact on OS.\nmKRAS and mBRAF seem to be prognostic factors in patients with CRC who undergo lung metastasectomy. Further studies are necessary.","title":"KRAS and BRAF mutations are prognostic biomarkers in patients undergoing lung metastasectomy of colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"25688918"}
