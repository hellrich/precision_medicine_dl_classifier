This study was a retrospective analysis of the characteristics of meningioma cases consecutively operated on at a single institution in China from 2001 to 2010.\nThis study investigated the demographic background of 7084 meningioma cases, and the subtypes and locations of the tumors. Sex and age distributions were analyzed, and the pathological subtypes were classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The location of the meningiomas was also categorized.\nThe female:male ratio of the 7084 cases was 2.34:1. The mean age was 51.4 years (range, 11 months-86 years). The mean age of cases of WHO grade I meningioma was significantly older than that of grade II or III meningiomas (P \u003c 0.001, Fisher\u0027s Least Significant Digit test). There was a significantly higher female:male ratio in WHO grade I meningiomas than in grade II or grade III meningiomas (2.57, 1.03 and 0.76, respectively; P \u003c 0.001, Ï‡(2) test). Meningothelial (n \u003d 2061) and fibrous meningiomas (n \u003d 3556) were the most common subtypes, comprising 79.3% of all meningiomas. All meningioma cases were classified into 23 locations in this study, with the cerebral convexity the most common site (38.33%, n \u003d 2722). Cases with uncommon locations such as extra-cranial and sylvian fissure meningiomas were also present in this series.\nFemale predominance was found for benign meningiomas, while malignant subtypes showed male predominance. The mean age of patients with WHO grade I meningiomas was older than that of patients with higher-grade tumors. Meningothelial and fibrous meningiomas were the most common subtypes. The cerebral convexity was the most common meningioma location.","title":"Histopathological classification and location of consecutively operated meningiomas at a single institution in China from 2001 to 2010.","pubmedId":"23422112"}
