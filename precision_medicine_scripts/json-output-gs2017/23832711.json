The myxoid component which was present in the well differentiated liposarcomatous component gave the tumor atypical radiological features. The case presented initial diagnostic difficulties, mainly because of the bland histomorphological appearance of the limited biopsy material from the sampled non-lipogenic, dedifferentiated component. The dedifferentiated part of the tumor turned out to harbor significant heterogeneity with regards to cellularity, cytomorphology and proliferative activity.","title":"Dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the deep (paralaryngeal) soft tissue: lessons learnt from a case with a partly deceptively benign appearing dedifferentiated component.","pubmedId":"23832711"}
