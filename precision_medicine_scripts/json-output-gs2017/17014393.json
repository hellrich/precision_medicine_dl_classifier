The number of mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in lung cancer has expanded considerably over the past three decades, and the crucial role of stress resistance pathways is increasingly recognised as a cause of intrinsic and acquired chemo- and radiotherapy resistance. This paper reviews recent evidence for stress defence proteins, particularly RALBP1/RLIP76, in mediating intrinsic and acquired chemotherapy and radiation resistance in human lung cancer.","title":"Therapeutic resistance in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"17014393"}
