{"genes":["MEK","BRAF","coBRIM"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"The MEK inhibitor cobimetinib (Cotellic(®)) is indicated for the treatment of patients with BRAF (V600) mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, in combination with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (Zelboraf(®)). In the pivotal coBRIM trial, previously untreated patients with BRAF (V600) mutation-positive unresectable, stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma received cobimetinib 60 mg once daily for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle plus vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily or vemurafenib alone. Compared with vemurafenib alone, cobimetinib plus vemurafenib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (primary endpoint) and was associated with a significantly higher overall response rate and significantly prolonged overall survival. Cobimetinib plus vemurafenib had a manageable tolerability profile. In conclusion, cobimetinib plus vemurafenib is a valuable option for use in BRAF (V600) mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
