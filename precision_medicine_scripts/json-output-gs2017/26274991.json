Here, the prognostic significance of atypical features in benign meningiomas was determined. METHODS Data from patients diagnosed with WHO Grade I benign meningiomas per the 2007 WHO criteria and who underwent surgery between 2002 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified by the absence or presence of 1 to 2 atypical features with review of the clinical and histological factors. RESULTS A total of 148 patients met the inclusion criteria (n \u003d 77 with atypia; n \u003d 71 without atypia). The median follow-up duration after pathological diagnosis was 37.5 months. Thirty patients had progression/recurrence (P/R) after initial treatment, and 22 (73%) of 30 patients with P/R had 1-2 atypical features. The presence of atypical features was significantly associated with P/R (p \u003d 0.03) and independent of the MIB-1 labeling index. The 1-year and 5-year actuarial rates of P/R were 9.6% versus 1.4% and 30.8% versus 13.8% fortumors with and without atypical features, respectively. Higher Simpson grade resection (II-IV vs I) was associated with the increased risk of P/R (p \u003c 0.001). Stratification of patients into low-risk (Simpson Grade I), intermediate-risk (Simpson Grade II-IV with no atypical features), and high-risk groups (Simpson Grade II-IV with atypical features) was significantly correlated with increased risk of P/R (p \u003c 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Patients with benign meningiomas with atypical features and those undergoing Simpson Grade II-IV resection are at significantly increased risk of P/R. Patients with these features may benefit from the consideration of additional surgery and/or radiation therapy.
