TNBC is a term derived from tumors that are characterized by the absence of ER, PgR, and HER2. So patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based therapies. TNBCs are biologically aggressive, although some reports suggest that they respond to chemotherapy better than other types of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor. This is due to: shortened disease-free interval in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting and a more aggressive course in the metastatic setting.
