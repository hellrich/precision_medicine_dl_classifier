For 58 samples archived from NSCLC patients, we measured the expression of miR-34a and c-MET, CDK4/6, and CCND1 by quantitative RT-PCR and assessed the relationship between miR-34a expression, clinicopathological factors, and RFS. The expression of miR-34a was significantly lower in squamous cell tumors (P \u003c 0.001) and in tumors associated with lymphatic invasion (P \u003d 0.001). We found significant inverse correlations between miR-34a and c-MET (R \u003d -0.316, P \u003d 0.028) and CDK6 expression (R \u003d -0.4582, P \u003d 0.004). RFS were longer in adenocarcinoma patients with high miR-34a expression than in those with low miR-34a expression (55.6 vs. 21.6 months; P \u003d 0.020). With univariate analysis, statistically significant prognostic factors for RFS in adenocarcinoma patients were miR-34a expression (Relative risk (RR), 8.14; P \u003d 0.049), TNM stage (RR, 13.55; P \u003d 0.001), LN metastasis (RR, 4.19; P \u003d 0.043), and the presence of lymphatic invasion (RR, 7.05; P \u003d 0.015). In multivariate analysis, only miR-34a was prognostic for RFS (RR, 11.5; P \u003d 0.027). miR-34a expression was inversely correlated with that of c-MET and CDK6 in NSCLC, and had prognostic significance for RFS, especially in adenocarcinoma patients.","title":"The expression of microRNA-34a is inversely correlated with c-MET and CDK6 and has a prognostic significance in lung adenocarcinoma patients.","pubmedId":"26104764"}
