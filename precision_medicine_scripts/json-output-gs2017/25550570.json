We present the immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular cytogenetic findings of DDLS arising in the right chest wall of a 76-year-old man. Magnetic resonance imaging exhibited a large mass composed of two components with heterogeneous signal intensities, suggesting the coexistence of a fatty area and another soft tissue component. The grossly heterogeneous mass was histologically composed of an ALT/WDLS component transitioning abruptly into a dedifferentiated component. Immunohistochemistry was positive for murine double-minute 2 (MDM2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and p16 in both components, although a more strong and diffuse staining was found in the dedifferentiated area. The MIB-1 labeling index was extremely higher in the dedifferentiated area compared to the ALT/WDLS area. Cytogenetic analysis of the ALT/WDLS component revealed the following karyotype: 46,X,-Y,+r. Notably, cytogenetic analysis of the dedifferentiated component revealed a similar but more complex karyotype. Spectral karyotyping demonstrated that the ring chromosome was entirely composed of material from chromosome 12. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 in both components. These findings suggest that multiple abnormal clones derived from a single precursor cell would be present in DDLS, with one or more containing supernumerary rings or giant marker chromosomes.
