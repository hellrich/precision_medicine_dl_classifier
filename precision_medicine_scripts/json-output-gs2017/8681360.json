The objective of the present investigation was to assess the occurrence of the mentioned risk factors (Fbg, t-PA and PAI-1) in diabetes mellitus (DM) type 1 and 2, compare them with findings in a healthy control group and the two types of diabetes mutually.\nFifty patients with type 1 DM were examined (mean BMI 23.8), 59 patients with type 2 DM (mean BMI 28) and 33 healthy subjects as controls (mean BMI 24.6). Both groups of diabetics were compensated. To assess the t-PA and PAI-1 concentration the ELISA test was used, Fbg was assessed by Clauss\u0027 method. The euglobulin fibrinolysis time (ECLT) was also examined. In both groups of patients with DM higher concentration of t-PA were found (DM type 7.06 +/- 2.4 ng/ml, p \u003c 0.05, DM type 2 15.15 +/- 6.07 ng/mg, control 4.67 +/- 2.87 ng/ml, p \u003c 0.05). In patients with DM type 1 a higher concentration of t-PA was found in patients with retinopathy (8.2 +/- 1.7 ng/ml than in patients with DM type 1 without retinopathy (6.9 +/- 1.3 ng/ml), p \u003c 0.05). The PA-1 concentration was, as compared with controls, raised only in type 2 diabetics (DM type 2 124.57 +/- 47.22 ng/ml, control 88.57 +/- 15.7 ng/ml p \u003c 0.05). Between the two groups also a difference in the PAI-1 level was found (DM type 179.25 +/- 17.95 ng/ml, vs. DM type 2, p \u003c 0.05). With these findings corresponded the ECLT activation in DM type 1 (203.4 +/- 76.8 min. vs. ECLT in the control group 276.08 +/- 84.87 min., p \u003c 0.05) and conversely a reduction of the euglobulin fibrinolysis in type 2 DM (448 +/- 117 min.), as compared with the controls (p \u003c 0.05), as well as compared with DM type 1 (p \u003c 0.05). The fibrinogen level was also elevated only in DM type 2 (3.619 +/- 0.69 g/l) as compared with the control group (2.42 +/- 0.42 g/l, p \u003c 0.05) as well as compared with DM type 1 (2.53 +/- 0.47 g/l, p \u003c 0.05). No difference was found in the fibrinogen level between DM type 1 and the control group.\nIn both groups of patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2 among the mentioned cardiovascular risk factors only a raised t-PA concentration was recorded. Concurrent elevation of PAI-1 and fibrinogen was found only in diabetes mellitus type 2.","title":"[Levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (T-PA), its inhibitor (PAI-1) and fibrinogen in the blood of patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus].","pubmedId":"8681360"}
