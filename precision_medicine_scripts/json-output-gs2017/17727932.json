The ideal surgical management of cervical cancer patients should be tailored on the basis of prognostic factors and quality of life. Within the discussion concerning the optimal level of radicality of hysterectomy, which is still controversial, the new concept of NSRH has to be considered in order to reduce morbidity without compromising the oncological disease control. Surgical strategies have been developed to spare the autonomic functions with promising results.\nTo date, there is a growing body of data about NSRH in cervical cancer. However, there is not yet a consensus concerning to which part of uterine support ligaments a NS approach should be directed.","title":"Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy in cervical cancer: evolution of concepts.","pubmedId":"17727932"}
