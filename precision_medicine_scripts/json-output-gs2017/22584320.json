Multidisciplinary treatment planning is needed(involving pathologists, radiologists, surgeons and medical oncologists)for patients with GIST. Medical treatment is usually selected for unresectable GIST, metastatic GIST at the initial examination, and recurrent GIST. Imatinib is strongly recommended for patients with KIT-positive GIST; the standard dose of imatinib mesylate(Glivec)is 400 mg/day. For patients with imatinib-resistant GIST, Sunitinib (Sutent)is now approved in Japan and is covered by medical insurance. However, high-dose imatinib(\u003e400mg/day)has not yet been approved in Japan.","title":"[Medical treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in Japan].","pubmedId":"22584320"}
