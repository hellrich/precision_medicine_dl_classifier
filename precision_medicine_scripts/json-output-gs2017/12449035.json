The doublet gemcitabine and cisplatin is a standard treatment, widely used in the world. The review of the literature, and specially several recent randomised phase III trial in stage IV NSCLC demonstrates the reproducibility of the results, and a manageable toxicity which allows its use in preoperative setting in stages I, II and resectable III. The carboplatin-gemcitabine doublet is under investigation.","title":"[Combinations of platinum salts and gemcitabine in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"12449035"}
