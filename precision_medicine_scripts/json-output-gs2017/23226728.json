The aim of the present study was to investigate the invasion- and metastasis-related gene, neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 9 (NEDD9), in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and cell lines. The expression of NEDD9 was analyzed by the SP method of immunohistochemistry for 60 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung adenocarcinoma tissues in which 32 cases were metastastic and 28 were without metastases. NEDD9 mRNA expression and protein levels were quantified by fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) and western blotting in the highly invasive lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549 and 95D as well as in SPC-A-1 cells with low invasive potential. The immunostaining scores revealed a statistically significant difference between metastatic and non-metastatic lung adenocarcinomas (p\u003c0.001). FQ-PCR and western blotting demonstrated that NEDD9 expression was higher in A549 and 95D compared to SPC-A-1 cells (P\u003d0.003). Our results provide evidence that NEDD9 is upregulated in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and in highly invasive lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, suggesting its potential involvement in regulating cell migration and invasion.","title":"Role of NEDD9 in invasion and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23226728"}
