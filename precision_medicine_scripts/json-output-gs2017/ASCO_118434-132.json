De novo EGFR T790M mutations in TKI-nave patients are rare when assessed by standard genotyping methods. The response to EGFR TKIs in patients with de novo EGFR T790M mutations is unknown.   Methods:  Patients with EGFRmutations were identified through routine testing, using PCR-based fragment length analysis, mass spectrometry-based genotyping (Sequenom), and Sanger sequencing.  Clinical characteristics, progression free survival (PFS) from start of EGFR TKI and overall survival (OS) were obtained from the medical record.   Results:  From 2008-2012, we observed EGFR T790M in 21 tumors from 20 patients who had not previously been treated with an EGFR TKI representing \u003c2% of all tumors with identified EGFR mutations. Two patients are included in reports from the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium. The median age at lung cancer diagnosis was 57 (range 35-90).  55% presented with stage IV disease. 60% were women.  65% were never-smokers. In all cases, T790M occurred concurrently with another EGFR mutation, L858R (76%, 16/21) or exon 19 deletion (24%, 5/21).  Compared to a contemporary cohort of  593 patients with EGFR mutations, in these patients with de novo EGFR T790M, L858R was more frequent than exon 19 deletion (p\u003d0.003).  Thirteen patients received erlotinib monotherapy as treatment for metastatic disease. Their response rate (CR+PR) was 9% (1/11, 95% Confidence Interval:  0-40%).  SD was observed in 36% (4/11). The median progression-free survival was 3 months and the median overall survival was 16 months.   Conclusions:   De novo EGFR T790M mutations are rare and occur most commonly with EGFR L858R. Overall survival for patients with de novo EGFR T790 mutations is shorter than what is seen in patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R, and appears more similar to EGFR wild-type patients. Response rate to EGFR TKI in these patients is low. EGFR TKI therapy for patients with de novo EGFR T790M appears to have limited objective benefit and should be considered only after standard cytotoxic chemotherapy.","title":"Response to erlotinib and prognosis for patients with de novo epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutations.","pubmedId":"ASCO_118434-132"}
