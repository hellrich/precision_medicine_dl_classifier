The RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway is involved in the development of A-ACs and is a potential therapeutic target. However, molecular profiles of A-ACs and their prognostic impact are poorly understood. Peptide nucleic acid-mediated polymerase chain reaction clamping and Mutyper were used to detect KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in 62 paraffinized samples of A-ACs. Of 62 A-ACs, 30.6% had KRAS mutations, but no BRAF mutations and low frequency (1.6%) of PIK3CA mutation were detected. KRAS mutation was correlated with poor tumor differentiation and was a predictor of shorter recurrence-free survival period in overall A-ACs, whereas the prognosis according to the histologic subtypes was not affected by KRAS mutation. Lymph node metastasis was an independent prognostic factor of poor overall survival. Intestinal- and pancreatobiliary-type A-ACs had similar prognosis. Intestinal- and pancreatobiliary-type A-ACs had different prognostic factors; tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis strongly predicted overall survival and recurrence-free survival in pancreatobiliary-type tumors, respectively, whereas no independent prognostic factors were demonstrated for intestinal-type tumors. Low incidence of KRAS mutations and their strong prognostic value in A-ACs may suggest the potential of survival benefit depending on the epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy. Much lower frequencies of BRAF and PIK3CA mutations may suggest that they do not play a major role in the tumorigenesis of A-ACs. Different therapeutic protocols should be considered for treating pancreatobiliary- and intestinal-type A-ACs.
