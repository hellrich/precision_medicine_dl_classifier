Inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction is a promising approach for activating p53, because this association is well characterized at the structural and biological levels. MDM2 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity, favours its nuclear export and stimulates its degradation, so inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction with synthetic molecules should lead to p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis in p53-positive stressed cells.","title":"Inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction: an important target for cancer therapy.","pubmedId":"12563309"}
