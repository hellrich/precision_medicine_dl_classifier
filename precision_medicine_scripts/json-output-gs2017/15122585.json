Immunohistochemical analysis for 133 cases revealed 2 types of staining pattern. The first group consisted of 95 cases (71.4%) characterized by apoptotic cells showing intensely positive staining for cdk4 and cyclin D1 but negative for other proteins (type A). In the second group (type B), comprising 38 cases (28.6%), apoptotic cells exhibited intense positive staining for any cyclins and cdks. Most of the latter cases had lost expression of Rb protein. When tumor cells retrieved from paraffin-embedded tissue were examined by flow cytometry, higher proportions of cells expressing only cdk4 or cyclin D1 in type A cases and of cells expressing any cyclin or cdk in type B cases showed a subdiploid DNA content. In survival analysis using the LI of apoptotic cells and cyclin/cdk-positive cells, the high-apoptosis/high-cyclin D1 group showed the poorest prognosis. Furthermore, forced overexpression of only cdk4 or cyclin D1 induced apoptosis in cultured cells with normal Rb protein, whereas overexpression of any cyclin or cdk induced apoptosis in cells defective for Rb protein. In conclusion, upregulation of cdk4/cyclin D1 may be a primary and critical factor in induction of apoptosis in human lung carcinomas in vivo. Moreover, inactivation of Rb protein renders cells more prone to apoptosis by abnormal expression of any cell-cycle protein.","title":"Overexpression of cdk4/cyclin D1, a possible mediator of apoptosis and an indicator of prognosis in human primary lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"15122585"}
