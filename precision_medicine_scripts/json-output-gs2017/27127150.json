The details of clinical data were examined, and risk factors for POPF and poor prognostic factors after PD were identified.\nPOPF occured in 26 patients (15%), and 18 patients (10%) were diagnosed as Grade B/C POPF. The independent risk factors for Grade B/C POPF were body mass index (BMI) ≥25 (Odds Ratio [OR]\u003d21.1, p\u003d0.006) and absence of post-operative enteral nutrition (EN) (OR\u003d10.2, p\u003d0.04). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survivals of patients with PDAC after PD were 76%, 35%, and 18%, respectively. R1/2 operation was identified as the only independent poor prognostic factor (Hazard Ratio\u003d3.66; p\u003d0.0002).\nPatients with BMI ≥25 should be closely monitored for POPF after PD. Post-operative EN might help prevent POPF. Performing R0 resection is an important goal for ensuring patient survival after PD for PDAC.","title":"Surgical Results of Pancreaticoduodenectomy for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: a Multi-institutional Retrospective Study of 174 patients.","pubmedId":"27127150"}
