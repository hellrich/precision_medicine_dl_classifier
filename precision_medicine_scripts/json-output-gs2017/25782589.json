Forty (58 %) patients received postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) to a median dose of 50.4 Gy with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil concurrently in all but one case; 15 patients also received gemcitabine prior to PORT. Twenty-nine (42 %) patients received gemcitabine-based chemotherapy without PORT for a median of 6 cycles.\nThe median overall survival for patients receiving PORT was 24.4 months compared to 25.6 months for patients not receiving PORT (p \u003d 0.943). At 2 years, the rate of local control was 57 % for patients receiving PORT compared to 37 % for those who did not (p \u003d 0.034). At 2 years, the rate of palliative local interventions was 16 % for patients receiving PORT compared to 18 % for patients who did not (p \u003d 0.821).\nThe use of PORT was associated with improved local control in the gemcitabine era for patients with resected, node-positive, pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The rates of overall survival and palliative interventions did not differ between the two groups.","title":"Patterns of Failure for Lymph Node-Positive Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma After Adjuvant Radiotherapy or Gemcitabine-based Chemotherapy Alone.","pubmedId":"25782589"}
