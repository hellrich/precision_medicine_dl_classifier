He was diagnosed with distal cholangiocarcinoma and paraneoplastic necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM). Treatment of NAM consisted of dexamethasone pulse therapy, prednisone, and single-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. The distal cholangiocarcinoma was resected through a total laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy. After hospital discharge, muscle strength initially increased postoperatively; however, pneumonia resulted in the deterioration of his general condition and death 5 months after the diagnosis of paraneoplastic NAM.","title":"Paraneoplastic Necrotizing Autoimmune Myopathy in a Patient Undergoing Laparoscopic Pancreatoduodenectomy for Distal Cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27843429"}
