Remarkable about this case was that the woman was not living in an endemic area and that the disease occurred outside the usual season. Furthermore, this indicates that an increase in transmission of tick-borne encephalitis can be expected outside the classical endemic areas in higher altitudes, possibly as a consequence of climate changes.","title":"[Headache and transient aphasia in a 35-year-old female patient].","pubmedId":"23558777"}
