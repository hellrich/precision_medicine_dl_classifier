The common activation of ALK has led to the use of the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib in a range of patient populations and to the rapid development of second-generation drugs targeting ALK. In this Review, we discuss our current understanding of ALK function in human cancer and the implications for tumour treatment.
