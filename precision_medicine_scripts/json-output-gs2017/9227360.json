The accumulated fluids, follicular fluid and Butschwiler\u0027s medium were compared for their effects on various parameters of boar sperm motility using the CellSoft, computer-assisted, digital image analysis system. Sperm velocity (micron s-1 +/- SEM) was significantly higher (P \u003c 0.05) in follicular fluid (84 +/- 3; n \u003d 5) than in fluids from the ampulla during peri- and early postovulatory intervals, and from the isthmic-utero-tubal junction during pre- and early postovulatory intervals. It was also higher (P \u003c 0.05) than in the fluid from the ampullary-isthmic junction during pre- and early postovulatory intervals; however, sperm velocity in follicular fluid was not significantly different from that in the periovulatory fluid from the ampullary-isthmic junction. The mean lateral head displacement (ALHmean) of spermatozoa was significantly greater in follicular fluid (3.9 +/- 0.3 microns; n \u003d 5) than in fluid from the ampulla during peri- and early postovulatory intervals and from the isthmic-utero-tubal junction during pre- and early postovulatory intervals, and was also higher (P \u003c 0.05) than in fluid from the ampullary-isthmic junction during the preovulatory period, but was not different from the peri- and postovulatory ampullary-isthmic junction fluids. The proportion of spermatozoa exhibiting circular motion was significantly higher (P \u003c 0.05) in the periovulatory fluid from the ampullary-isthmic junction (24 +/- 3%) compared with fluids obtained during preovulatory and early postovulatory periods. Follicular fluid had no effect on the proportion of spermatozoa exhibiting circular motion. The average radius of sperm movement in circular trajectories was higher in follicular fluid than in the periovulatory fluids from the ampulla and ampullary-isthmic junction (P \u003c 0.05). In hydrosalpingeal fluids collected 2-5 days after ovulation, the average radius of movement was greater in the ampulla fluid and ampullary-isthmic junction fluid than in fluid from the isthmic-utero-tubal junction (P \u003c 0.05). These results demonstrate that follicular fluid and oviductal fluids have considerable influences on boar sperm motility. Furthermore, the immediate effect of periovulatory ampullary-isthmic junction fluid in increasing the percentage of spermatozoa swimming in circles (hyperactivated) is relevant, since it is at this time and within this region that fertilization occurs.","title":"Motility of spermatozoa in hydrosalpingeal and follicular fluid of pigs.","pubmedId":"9227360"}
