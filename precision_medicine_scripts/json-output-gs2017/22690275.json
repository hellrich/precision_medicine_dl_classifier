MRI demonstrated a lobulated, septated intermuscular mass with marked heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement. A small focus of the tumor demonstrated fat suppressed signal more characteristic of well-differentiated liposarcoma. Pathologic analysis following wide local excision revealed a large, high grade sarcomatous component with highly pleomorphic cells with a thin rim of well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcoma on histologic examination. Dedifferentiated liposarcomas arising outside of the retroperitoneum are very rare, as are dedifferentiated liposarcomas arising from a histologically mixed liposarcoma. In this regard, this case illustrates an unusual combination of tumor location and histology which, to our knowledge, has not previously been reported.","title":"Primary dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the axilla arising in a mixed, well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"22690275"}
