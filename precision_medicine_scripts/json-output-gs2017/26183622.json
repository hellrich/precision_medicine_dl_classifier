Because ICC is relatively rare, the TNM staging system for ICC was finally established in the 2000s. Resection margin status and lymph node metastases are important prognostic factors after surgery for ICC; however, the true impact of wide resection margins or lymph node dissection on postoperative survival is unclear. Although adjuvant chemotherapy can improve the postoperative prognosis of patients with various types of cancer, no standard regimen has been developed for ICC. Over 50 % of patients suffer postoperative recurrence, even after curative resection, and no effective treatment for recurrent ICC has been established. Therefore, despite advances in imaging studies and hepatobiliary surgery, significant challenges remain in improving the prognosis of patients with ICC.","title":"Surgical treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26183622"}
