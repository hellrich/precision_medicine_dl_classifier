Its low or lacking expression closely relates with tumor progress and poor prognosis. The regulation and function ascribed to PTEN have become more diverse since its discovery as a putative phosphatase mutated in many human tumors. PTEN function is positively and negatively regulated at the transcriptional level, as well as post-translationally by phosphorylation, oxidation and acetylation. Deregulation of PTEN is implicated in other human diseases in addition to cancers, including diabetes and obesity, modulation of PTEN level has widespread therapeutic applications to those tumorigenesis and non-tumor diseases. This review will summarize the new points on the regulation of PTEN and briefly discuss the potential therapeutic role of PTEN in some diseases.","title":"New insights into PTEN regulation mechanisms and its potential function in targeted therapies.","pubmedId":"22902055"}
