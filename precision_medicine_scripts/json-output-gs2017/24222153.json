A therapeutic response of disease control (DC) and the onset of skin rash prolonged the progression-free survival (PFS), whereas the onset of interstitial lung disease shortened both PFS and overall survival (OS). The DC group also experienced prolonged OS.\nErlotinib may be a therapeutic option for EGFR-mutated NSCLC with gefitinib resistance, as well as for NSCLC with wild-type EGFR. Therapeutic response of DC and the onset of the described adverse events may be practical predictors of survival in erlotinib treatment.","title":"Clinical significance of erlotinib monotherapy for gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations.","pubmedId":"24222153"}
