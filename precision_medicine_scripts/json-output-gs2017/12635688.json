Previously, a retroperitoneal liposarcoma had been surgically removed followed by postoperative radiation. Visual acuity was normal. There was proptosis of the left eye, increased retrobulbar resistance and reduced mobility. Trans-septal orbital biopsies showed liposarcoma. The patient was initially treated with prednisolone and later received radio- and chemotherapy. Despite treatment he lost vision of the left eye and died a few months later.\nHistological examination of the orbital tumor revealed a spindle-cell liposarcoma similar to the primary tumor of the retroperitoneum.\nLiposarcoma metastatic to the orbit is rare, but should be suspected in a patient with proptosis caused by a space-occupying lesion and a history of liposarcoma.","title":"Liposarcoma metastatic to the orbit.","pubmedId":"12635688"}
