The variations may serve as prognostic and predictive biomarkers to allow for more individualized therapy.\nWe evaluated 832 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the OmniExpress genotyping platform (IlluminaÂ®) in the boundaries of 61 candidate genes reported to be involved in the androgen metabolic pathway. The purpose was to investigate them for an association with time to treatment failure in 68 white men with metastatic, castration refractory prostate cancer undergoing treatment with abiraterone acetate. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used with Gleason score, age, level of alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen at treatment initiation as covariates. Each single nucleotide polymorphism was assessed using an allele carriage genetic model in which carriage of 1 or more minor alleles contributes to increased risk. Subset analyses were done to determine whether metastasis site, or prior treatment with ketoconazole or docetaxel would interact with the single nucleotide polymorphisms investigated.\nSix single nucleotide polymorphisms in the estrogen sulfotransferase gene SULT1E1 were associated with time to treatment failure on abiraterone acetate therapy after false discovery rate (q value) correction for multiple testing while controlling for Gleason score, age, level of alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen at treatment initiation (q \u003c0.05).\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms in SULT1E1 were significantly associated with time to treatment failure in men on abiraterone acetate therapy. The single nucleotide polymorphisms may serve as predictive markers for treatment with abiraterone acetate.","title":"Inherited Variants in SULT1E1 and Response to Abiraterone Acetate by Men with Metastatic Castration Refractory Prostate Cancer.","pubmedId":"27150425"}
