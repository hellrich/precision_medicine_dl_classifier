Few options are available to patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure refractory to oral medical therapy. Over the last 15-20 years milrinone, a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, has been used occasionally to treat patients with acute heart failure and as a bridge to heart transplantation and, more recently, has been used intermittently or continuously on an outpatient basis. We report a patient with severe, chronic congestive heart failure, whom we treated successfully with continuous milrinone infusions as an outpatient. We were able to wean him of the milrinone after successful up-titration of carvedilol. Nine months after discontinuation of milrinone the patient remains stable in New York Heart Association class I on high dose carvedilol. Research is required to validate the possibility that patients with severe heart failure may be successfully weaned from milrinone using carvedilol and achieve significant improvement of their functional status and quality of life. This may prove to be an effective strategy for the treatment of selected patients with severe, chronic congestive heart failure.
