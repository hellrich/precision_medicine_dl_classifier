However, the etiology of EGFR mutations in this population remains unclear. The authors hypothesized that the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16/18 (HPV16/18) E6 oncoprotein may contribute to EGFR mutations in Taiwanese patients with lung cancer.\nOne hundred fifty-one tumors from patients with lung cancer were enrolled to determine HPV16/18 E6 and EGFR mutations using immunohistochemistry and direct sequencing, respectively. Levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u0027-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in lung tumors and cells were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. An supF mutagenesis assay was used to determine H2 O2 -induced mutation rates of lung cancer cells with or without E6 expression.\nPatients with E6-positive tumors had a greater frequency of EGFR mutations than those with E6-negative tumors (41% vs 20%; P \u003d .006). Levels of 8-oxo-dG were correlated with EGFR mutations (36% vs 16%; P \u003d .012). Two stable clones of E6-overexpressing H157 and CL-3 cells were established for the supF mutagenesis assay. The data indicated that the cells with high E6 overexpression had higher H2 O2 -induced SupF gene mutation rates compared with the cells that expressed lower levels of E6 and compared with vector control cells.\nHPV16/18 E6 may contribute in part to EGFR mutations in lung cancer, at least in the Taiwanese population.","title":"Association of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations with human papillomavirus 16/18 E6 oncoprotein expression in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23797467"}
