Despite and increasing incidence of breast cancer, mortality has undergone a gradual decline. This decline in mortality is likely due to numerous factors, including earlier stage at diagnosis, advances in local therapy, and advances in systemic treatment of breast cancer. This article review the background and implementation of the current use of chemotherapy in adjuvant setting.\nThe authors reviewed data from published randomized trials and meta-analyzes to analyze the rationale behind the current use of systemic chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting. Recent data regarding the use of taxanes as well as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in also presented.\nNumerous randomized trial and the data obtained from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists\u0027 Collaborative Group confirm that both pre- and postmenopausal woman benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Anthracycline- containing regimens are superior to those hot containing anthracycline, and should be incorporated into the care of most patients with operable breast cancer. The decision to use chemotherapy should be based upon the potential benefits and theoretical risks associated with therapy and individualized for each patient.","title":"Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.","pubmedId":"12269263"}
