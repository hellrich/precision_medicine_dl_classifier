Those bands were both assigned to chromosome 5. Such a finding was somewhat in contrast with the reportedly low frequency of APC gene mutations in ampullary cancers, located at chromosome 5q21, and suggested that loci different from that of APC might be the target of chromosome 5 allelic losses (LOH) in these tumours. Therefore, we analysed chromosome 5 LOH in a panel of 27 ampullary tumours, including eight adenomas, four early- and 15 advanced-stage cancers, using 16 PCR-amplified CA microsatellite polymorphic markers spanning the entire chromosome. Nineteen cases (70%) showed LOH, and the interstitial deletions found in these tumours described two smallest common deleted regions, in which putative suppressor genes might reside. They were at 5q13.3-q14 and at 5q23-q31 respectively, which correspond to those found in gastric tumours. In addition, the presence of 5q LOH in six of eight adenomas and in three of four early-stage cancers suggests that such phenomena occur at early stages of neoplastic progression of the ampullary epithelium.","title":"Chromosome 5 allelic losses are early events in tumours of the papilla of Vater and occur at sites similar to those of gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"9862579"}
