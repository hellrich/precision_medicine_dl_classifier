The introduction of targeted biologic therapies, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has expanded the treatment options and has shown promise for patients with advanced disease. This article gives a history of the treatment of colorectal cancer, with a focus on the efficacy and toxicity of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and their implications for the nursing community.","title":"Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor in colorectal carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17666985"}
