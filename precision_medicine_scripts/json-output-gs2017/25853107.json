In particular, missense mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) at arginine 132, mostly substituted into histidine (IDH1-R132H) were observed to frequently occur in glioma patients.\nWe have purified recombinant IDH1 and IDH1-R132H proteins and monitored their catalytic activities. In parallel experiments, we have attempted to find new selective IDH1-R132H chemical inhibitor(s) from a fragment-based chemical library.\nWe have found that IDH1, but not IDH1-R132H, can catalyze the conversion of isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). In addition, we have observed that IDH1-R132H was more efficient than IDH1 in converting α-KG into (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG). Moreover, we have identified a new hit molecule, e.g., 2-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)isothioazol-3(2H)-one as a new selective IDH1-R132H inhibitor.\nWe have observed an underlying biochemical mechanism explaining how a heterozygous IDH1 mutation contributes to the generation of R-2HG and increases cellular histone H3 trimethylation levels. We have also identified a novel selective IDH1-R132H chemical hit molecule, e.g., 2-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)isothioazol-3(2H)-one, which could be used for a future lead development against IDH1-R132H.","title":"Identification of a new selective chemical inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase-1.","pubmedId":"25853107"}
