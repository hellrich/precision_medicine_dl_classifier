Strategies targeting members of this family, especially CCN2, are under development as novel therapeutic approaches to highly metastatic cancers such as pancreatic cancer. In prior reports, the Kleer laboratory and colleagues have linked reduced expression of CCN6 (WISP3) with aggressive breast cancers. Loss of CCN6 was associated with elevated Akt phosphorylation and TAK1 activation. In a recent report, the same group reports that, by modulating Notch signaling, CCN6 can promote the maintenance of an epithelial phenotype and also reduce cancer cell migration and invasion, tumor initiation, and metastasis (Oncotarget in press DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.7734 ). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that addition of CCN6 peptides may represent a novel, viable therapeutic approach to blocking aggressive breast cancers.
