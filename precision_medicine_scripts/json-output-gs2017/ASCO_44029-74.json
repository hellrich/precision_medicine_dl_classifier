It is expected that specific signaling pathway-activating mutations like PTEN-loss will produce changes in the surface and secreted proteomes of the affected tissue and should be detectable as biomarker signatures in the serum. Methods: We applied a novel two-stage strategy for the discovery of PCa biomarker signatures corresponding to cancer-causing PTEN loss. First, we used quantitative proteomic technologies to identify 785 glycoproteins from sera and prostate tissue of wild-type and prostate-specific PTEN-null mice. Second, following bioinformatic prioritization, we quantified 48 human orthologue candidate biomarkers in sera of patients with PCa or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The resulting candidate protein profiles were used to compute highly predictive regression models. Results: We identified a 5-protein signature that correctly predicted 71% of cases belonging to patients having aberrant or normal PTEN status (sensitivity\u003d68%, specificity\u003d85%, AUC\u003d0.85). In addition we identified a 3-protein signature that correctly predicted patients having tumors with a Gleason score  7(3+4) or  7(4+3) (AUC 0.92). Finally we found a 4-protein signature that discriminated between BPH and PCa with a sensitivity\u003d78% and specificity\u003d63% (AUC\u003d0.74), in combination with PSA with a sensitivity\u003d90% and specificity\u003d83% (AUC\u003d0.84). Conclusions: The identification of the 5-protein signature reflecting tissue PTEN status may aid in selecting patients to treat with inhibitors of the PI3K pathway. Combination of our 4-protein signature and PSA has a higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity than PSA alone and therefore may improve the effectiveness of PCa screening. The predictive 3-protein signature for Gleason score could facilitate decisions on individualized PCa treatment. Taken together our approach suggests a way for rational cancer biomarker discovery guided by human cancer genetics and based on integration of experimental mouse models, novel proteomics-based technologies and computational modeling.","title":"Cancer genetics-guided discovery of serum biomarker signatures for prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_44029-74"}
