For 76.2% of lung adenocarcinomas, the level of KRAS mutation was greater than the upper 95% confidence interval of that in normal lung.\nKRAS mutant tumor subpopulations, not detectable by DNA sequencing, may drive resistance to EGFR blockade in lung adenocarcinoma patients.","title":"Low-frequency KRAS mutations are prevalent in lung adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"27795727"}
