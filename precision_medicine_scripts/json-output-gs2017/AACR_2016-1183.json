It is particularly effective against myxoid liposarcoma, a specific histological subtype within the family of adults soft tissue sarcomas. More than 90% of usual myxoid/round cell liposarcomas (MRCLS) are characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(12;16) (q13; p11), which produces the FUS-CHOP oncogene. Different chimera subtypes seem to respond differently to trabectedin in clinical setting. Trabectedin was able to remove FUS-CHOP type I, II and III from its own target genes but it causes adipocytic maturation and tumor regression only in type I and II, not in type III MRCLS (Di Giandomenico et al, Oncogene, 2014 Oct 30; 33(44): 5201-10). Pioglitazone is a PPARgamma agonist with pro-differentiation effects in different cancer types included liposarcomas (Tontonoz P. et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Jan 7;94(1): 237-41).The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of trabectedin with pioglitazone in type III myxoid liposarcoma xenografts.ML006 and ML004 type III MRCLS xenografts mice were treated with trabectedin 0.15 mg/kg iv every seven days for three times or pioglitazone 150 mg/kg po daily for 28 days or with their combination. For antitumor activity evaluation, tumor growth was measured with a caliper and the tumor weights (1 mm3 \u003d 1 mg) were calculated with the formula: length  (width)2/2. Fifteen days after the last dose of trabectedin and 4 h after the last dose of pioglitazone tumors were collected from a separate group of mice to perform histological and molecular analyses.Trabectedin and pioglitazone as single agents have a comparable antitumor activity on these models with T/C around 40-50% with no tumor regression observed. In the combination groups an impressive and long lasting tumor regression was observed in ML 006 xenograft, with an observed optimal T/C of 17%. In ML004 MRCLS model the combination of trabectedin and pioglitazone induced a minimal regression followed by a long lasting tumor stabilization, resulting in a T/C of 23%. The histological analyses showed adipocytic maturation in tumors treated with pioglitazone alone or in combination but not in samples from mice treated with trabectedin alone.In conclusion, the combination of trabectedin with pioglitazone was able to induce tumor regression and adipocytic maturation in type III myxoid liposarcoma xenografts that were only marginally sensitive to trabectedin alone. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, gene expression profile and Western Blot analysis are on-going to unravel the molecular mechanism behind the potentiation of the antitumor efficacy observed with this combination.","title":"PPARgamma agonist promotes adipocytic differentiation and potentiates the activity of trabectedin in myxoid liposarcoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1183"}
