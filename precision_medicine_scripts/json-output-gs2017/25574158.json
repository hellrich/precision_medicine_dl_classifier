This review focuses on our current understanding of functional and therapeutic potentials of histone demethylases in colon cancer. Colon cancer is the third most common malignancy worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The key protein families responsible for demethylation of histones, histone demethylases, have emerged as new therapeutic targets in different cancer types including colon cancer. These families are of great interest as potential novel biomarkers for diagnosis and targets for therapy and prevention of colon cancer. In this manuscript, we will discuss our current understanding of the histone demethylase family, and the role they play as epigenetic activators or repressors of different genes in colon cancer.","title":"Histone Demethylases in Colon Cancer.","pubmedId":"25574158"}
