The ability to predict which patients might be at increased risk prior to exposure would be valuable to optimally counsel risk to benefit ratio for each patient. Herein we present a genome wide approach for biomarker discovery with two validation cohorts to predict CHF from adult patients planning to receive an anthracycline. Methods: We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) in 3431 patients from the randomized phase III adjuvant breast cancer trial E5103 to identify SNP genotypes associated with an increased risk of anthracycline-induced CHF. We further attempted candidate validation in two independent phase III adjuvant trials, E1199 and BEATRICE. Results: When evaluating for cardiologist adjudicated CHF, 11 SNPs had a p-value \u003c10-5 of which 9 independent chromosomal regions were associated with increased risk. Validation of the 2 top SNPs in E1199 revealed one SNP, rs28714259 that demonstrated a borderline increased CHF risk (p\u003d0.04, OR\u003d1.9). rs28714259 was subsequently tested in BEATRICE and was significantly associated with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (p\u003d0.018, OR\u003d4.2). Combining results from these independent studies provided further evidence of a significant association between rs28714259 and cardiac damage (p\u003d7.4 x10-9). Conclusions:rs28714259 represents a validated SNP that is associated with anthracycline-induced CHF in three independent, phase III adjuvant breast cancer clinical trials.","title":"Genome wide association study for anthracycline-induced congestive heart failure.","pubmedId":"ASCO_163525-176"}
