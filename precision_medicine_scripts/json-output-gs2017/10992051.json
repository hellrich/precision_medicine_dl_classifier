Curative excision is contraindicated in case of metastasis to the liver, peritoneum or distal nodes or in case of arterial invasion. Inversely, isolated venous invasion is not incompatible with curative surgery if one can accept the potential overmortality due to the vascular risk. Palliative surgery may be indicated for tumors limited to the pancreas in selected patients as it appears to improve survival and quality of life over derivation surgery. Preoperative biliary drainage using an endoscopic, a percutaneous or a surgical approach increases the rate of surgical complications and mortality and should be avoided, especially when the resectability of the tumor is not formally established. Wide node dissection does not modify prognosis after excision and would not be warranted on the basis of current data. Preserving the pyloris increases the rate of postoperative gastroparesia without bringing the expected nutritional advantages. It is not warranted in this indication. The type of pancreas anastomosis (pancreatogastric or pancreatojejunal) does not modify the incidence of complications or pancreatic fistulae. The rate of pancreatic fistulae and postoperative complications is decreased by preventive administration of octreotide, particularly when the pancreas is healthy. The prevalence of postoperative gastroparesia is decreased by preventive treatment with intravenous erythromycin. Progress will undoubtedly issue from complimentary treatments combining radiotherapy and chemotherapy","title":"[Surgical treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: limitations and latest developments].","pubmedId":"10992051"}
