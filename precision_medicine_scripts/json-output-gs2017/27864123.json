Tissues and follow-up data from 142 patients with (LNM group) and 154 without (non-LNM group) metastases were collected. Expression of PTEN/PI3K/AKT was detected using immunohistochemistry staining. With axillary LNM, the positive rate of PTEN was reduced, whereas that of PI3K and AKT was increased. Expression of AKT was negatively correlated with PTEN expression but positively correlated with PI3K expression. Apparent correlations were detected between AKT and axillary LNM with a tumor size â‰¤2 cm; between PTEN, PI3K, and AKT and axillary LNM in stage T1 or T2 breast cancer and invasive carcinoma of a nonspecial type; and between PTEN and AKT and axillary LNM of histologic grade I or II tumors and non-triple-negative breast cancer (all P\u003c.05). In the LNM group, the 5-year survival rate of patients with PTEN-positive tumors was higher than that of patients with PTEN-negative lesions; whereas in the non-LNM group, the 5-year survival rate of patients with AKT-positive tumors was lower than that of patients with AKT-negative lesions (both P\u003c.05). Cox regression analysis showed that PTEN expression was an independent prognostic factor for patients with LNM; AKT expression, tumor diameter, pathologic grade, and pathologic type were independent prognostic factors for patients without LNM. In conclusion, TEN/PI3K/AKT proteins are related to the clinicopathologic features and prognosis of breast cancer with axillary LNM.","title":"PTEN/PI3K/AKT protein expression is related to clinicopathologic features and prognosis in breast cancer with axillary lymph node metastases.","pubmedId":"27864123"}
