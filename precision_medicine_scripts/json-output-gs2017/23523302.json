Factors significantly associated with EUS detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were total bilirubin level greater than 2 mg/dL (P \u003c .001), CT finding of pancreatic duct dilation (P \u003c .001), bile duct stricture (P \u003c .001), and tumor size 1.5 cm or larger detected by EUS (P \u003d .004). Among them, pancreatic duct dilation on CT (odds ratio 4.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-11.05), and tumor size 1.5 cm or larger detected by EUS (odds ratio 8.46; 95% confidence interval, 2.02-35.45) were independent risk factors.\nRetrospective design and patient referral bias.\nWhen MDCT is indeterminate, EUS is a highly sensitive and accurate modality for the detection of pancreatic neoplasm, especially when the tumor is smaller than 2.0 cm.","title":"Use of EUS-FNA in diagnosing pancreatic neoplasm without a definitive mass on CT.","pubmedId":"23523302"}
