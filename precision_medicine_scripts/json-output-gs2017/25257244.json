Mutation testing demonstrated BRAF(V600E) mutation status, an unexpected finding given his age. He died two weeks after presentation.\nAs our understanding of the molecular subtypes of melanoma increases, in the future it may be possible to predict which melanoma patients have a predilection to developing DMC. Mutation testing of DMC patients should be considered as BRAF inhibitors, and other novel targeted therapies may improve the bleak prognosis associated with this unusual presentation of metastatic melanoma.","title":"Diffuse melanosis cutis in the setting of BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"25257244"}
