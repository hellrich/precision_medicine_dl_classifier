The symptoms became persistent and complete on the following day. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute cerebral infarction in the right frontal lobe and a 20 mm diameter tumor in the planum sphenoidale encasing the right anterior cerebral artery. Cerebral angiography demonstrated occlusion of the right A(2) portion. The patient underwent surgery and the tumor was gross totally removed. The histological diagnosis was meningothelial meningioma. Cases of meningioma causing cerebral infarction are very rare, but the possibility should be considered even if the tumor is small.","title":"Meningioma manifesting as cerebral infarction.","pubmedId":"20671387"}
