The impact of common oncogenic driver mutations on prognosis in stage I NSCLC is limited. The pure prognostic value of KRAS mutational status was explored in resected stage I lung adenocarcinoma.\nMutation status was tested in patients who had complete resection of stage I lung adenocarcinoma without any adjuvant therapy, using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction)-based assay. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with KRAS-mutant (KRAS-MUT), KRAS-MUT subtypes, and KRAS wild-type (KRAS-WT) tumors.\nA total of 312 patients were included in this analysis; 127 harbored KRAS mutations and 185 had KRAS-WT tumors. When compared with KRAS-WT, KRAS-MUT was associated with significantly shorter OS (hazard ratio 4.36, 95% confidence interval 2.09-9.07; p \u003c 0.0001) and DFS (hazard ratio 3.62, 95% confidence interval 2.11-6.22; p \u003c 0.0001). When stratifying KRAS-WT patients based on EGFR status, KRAS-MUT patients had worse OS (p \u003d 0.0001) and DFS (p \u003c 0.0001) than patients with EGFR-MUT and EGFR-WT/KRAS-WT (WT/WT). Patients with codon 12 mutations had superior DFS (p \u003d 0.0314), but there were no differences in OS compared with mutations found in codons 13 and 61 (p \u003d 0.1772). We observed better DFS associated with G12C/G12V mutations compared with other amino acid specific KRAS mutations (p \u003d 0.0271) with a trend towards improved OS (p \u003d 0.0636). Multivariate analysis identified KRAS mutation as independent predictor of worse OS (p \u003d 0.001) and DFS (p \u003c 0.0001).\nKRAS is an independent prognostic marker in resected stage I lung adenocarcinoma. Differential outcomes are associated with codon and amino acid specific KRAS mutations.","title":"The prognostic impact of KRAS, its codon and amino acid specific mutations, on survival in resected stage I lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25122432"}
