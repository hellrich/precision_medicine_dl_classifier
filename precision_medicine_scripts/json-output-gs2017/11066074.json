The assay is based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and applicable to archival paraffin-embedded tumour material. All KRAS amplicons are analysed within two lanes of a DGGE gel under a single set of experimental conditions. Six known codon 12 mutations in genomic DNA from different paraffin-embedded tumours could readily be detected. When testing 35 paraffin-embedded Dukes\u0027 C colorectal carcinomas for unknown mutations, 12 tumours were found with mutations in codons 12 or 13. None of the tumours appeared to have a codon 61 mutation. In nine tumours, however, 11 additional sequence variations were found outside the hot-spot codons. None of these occurred in germline DNA from 57 individuals. Of these variations, three are considered as significant mutations, as they result in a non-conservative substitution of amino acid residues essential for the functioning of the KRAS protein. Thus, in total, 15 of the 35 Dukes\u0027 C tumours (43%) had a KRAS mutation of functional significance. Moreover, a novel exon 4B polymorphism was found to occur in 10 of the 35 tumours. The results of this study suggest that in restricting analysis of KRAS to hot-spot mutation sites only, significant information may be missed.","title":"New comprehensive denaturing-gradient-gel- electrophoresis assay for KRAS mutation detection applied to paraffin-embedded tumours.","pubmedId":"11066074"}
