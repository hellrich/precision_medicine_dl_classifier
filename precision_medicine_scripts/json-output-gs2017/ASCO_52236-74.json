However, The association of EGFR gene-copy number with mutation and predictive values to EGFR-TKIs treatment in clinically unselected Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC remain to be unclear. We analyze the relationship between EGFR biomarkers status and clinical outcome in the patients received EGFR-TKI therapy. Methods: Total 102 Chinese patients who received EGFR-TKIs therapy were included in this study. Biomarkers included EGFR mutation (DHPLC), EGFR gene-copy number (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Results: Among 102 patients, 32 (31%) had high EGFR gene-copy number. The objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and median survival time (MST) in the patients with high EGFR gene-copy number were 37.04%,74.07%, 5.13 and 13.20 months, respectively, closed to those with low EGFR gene-copy number (29.33%, 64% 4.75 and 14.70, respectively; p \u003e 0.05). EGFR mutation was detected in 46 out of 102 patients (45%). No relationship was evidenced between EGFR gene-copy number and EGFR mutation (Interaction test p \u003d 0.302). According to EGFR gene-copy number and EGFR mutation status, the patients were divided to four subgroups (FISH+/Mutation-, FISH+/Mutation+, FISH-/Mutation-, FISH-/Mutation+). ORR of four subgroup were 33.33%, 40%, 41% and 20.45%, respectively (p \u003d 0.205). The patients with both EGFR wild-type and low gene-copy number (FISH-/Mutation -) presented poorer ORR than those with EGFR mutation or/and high gene-copy number (20.45% vs 39.66%, p \u003d 0.041). PFS and OS were longer in the patients with co- existing EGFR mutation and high EGFR gene-copy number (7.87 ms, 16.90 ms, respectively) than other three subgroups, but difference didn\u0027t reach statistical significance (p \u003d 0.233, p \u003d 0.339). Conclusions: The association was not found between EGFR gene-copy number and mutation in this patient population.The patients with coexisting EGFR mutation and high EGFR gene-copy number had potential better predicting value to EGFR-TKI.","title":"The relationship between EGFR gene copy number and EGFR mutation and clinical predicting significance in the Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_52236-74"}
