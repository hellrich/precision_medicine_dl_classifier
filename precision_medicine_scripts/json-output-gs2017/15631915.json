The aim of this study is to analyze and establish a therapeutic strategy for early tumors in the upper third of the stomach.\nPatients (n \u003d 673; 79 patients were located in the upper third of the stomach and 594 in more distal sites) with early gastric cancer who underwent curative gastrectomy were included in this study. Clinicopathologic characteristics and results of operations for early tumors were compared between the two groups. Prognostic factors were evaluated with uni- and multivariate analyses.\nTumors in the upper third of the stomach were more often protruded, differentiated, submucosa invasive, and located at the posterior wall, and more often involved venous invasion and adjacent metastatic lymph nodes. Lymph node metastasis, but not tumor location, was an independent prognostic factor in all registered patients. Results of operations were not different between the two groups.\nEarly proximal tumors show distinct features, but prognosis after curative operation is as good as that of distal two-third tumors.","title":"Surgical outcomes for early gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach.","pubmedId":"15631915"}
