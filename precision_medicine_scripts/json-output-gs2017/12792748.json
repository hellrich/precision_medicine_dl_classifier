However, the relations between CDKN2A hypermethylation and clinicopathological findings, and patient prognosis, remain inconclusive. We analyzed the CDKN2A methylation status in primary colorectal cancers using real-time methylation specific PCR (MethyLight) which enables quantitative measuring of the methylation level. CDKN2A promoter methylation was detectable in 55 (61.1%) of 90 tumor samples and the median level of the methylation was 0.187 (range 0.00-197.9). The methylation value of CDKN2A was correlated with certain clinicopathological findings, including tumor differentiation (p\u003d0.018), and Dukes stage (p\u003d0.016). In survival analysis, the CDKN2A methylation level was correlated with a poor prognosis of the patient with colorectal cancer for either all cases (p\u003d0.014) or Dukes C (p\u003d0.004) cases that were analyzed. These results suggest that CDKN2A methylation status is a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer and may be of use for the patient specific design of therapy.","title":"Hypermethylation of the CDKN2A gene in colorectal cancer is associated with shorter survival.","pubmedId":"12792748"}
