There was also no association between polyunsaturated fat and the risk of overall or subgroups of rectal cancer. Linoleic acid, the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in the diet, was associated with increased risk of colon tumors with only a KRAS mutation and no additional truncating APC mutation or lack of MLH1 expression (RR \u003d 1.41, 95% CI 1.18-1.69 for one standard deviation (i.e., 7.5 g/day) increase in intake, p-trend over the quartiles of intake \u003c0.001). Linoleic acid intake was not associated with risk of colon tumors without any of the gene defects, or with tumors harboring aberrations in either MLH1 or APC.\nLinoleic acid intake is associated with colon tumors with an aberrant KRAS gene, but an intact APC gene and MLH1 expression, suggesting a unique etiology of tumors with specific genetic aberrations.","title":"Dietary fat and risk of colon and rectal cancer with aberrant MLH1 expression, APC or KRAS genes.","pubmedId":"17636402"}
