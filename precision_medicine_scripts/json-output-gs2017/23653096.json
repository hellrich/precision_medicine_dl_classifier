Multivariate logistic regression was carried out to analyze the data.\nAfter adjusting for Gleason score, the odds of having capsular penetration were 5.19 times higher (P \u003d 0.015) for ERG+/PTEN- group as compared to the wild type (ERG-/PTEN+).\nThis study presents the first evidence that ERG over expression and PTEN deletion is associated with greater risk of capsular penetration. Although further studies are needed, these results have the potential to change clinical assessment for prostate cancer.","title":"ERG overexpression and PTEN status predict capsular penetration in prostate carcinoma.","pubmedId":"23653096"}
