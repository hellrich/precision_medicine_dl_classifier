Fibroblast growth factor receptor-type 1 (FGFR1) may play a role in the pathogenesis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and amplification of the FGFR1 gene is considered a candidate target for treatment of LSCC. The aim of this study was to simultaneously explore copy number changes of FGFR1 and 23 other genes by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), to compare the results with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) data, and determine the clinicopathological significance of gene amplification.Methods: This study included 81 resected LSCC specimens obtained between 2008 and 2010, and 14 lung cancer cell lines. MLPA was performed using fresh tumor samples and cell lines and FISH was applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.Results: MLPA showed amplification/gain of MYC (48.1% of LSCCs), AURKA (44.4%), MET (29.6%), KIT (21.0%), and FGFR1 (14.8%). FISH showed FGFR1 amplification in 22 LSCCs (27.2%) using a cut-off value of 5. There was high concordance between FISH and MLPA (85.2%). No association between FGFR1 amplification and any clinicopathological variables was observed; however, associations were identified between EGFR and FGFR1 FISH-amplified tumors; PDGFRA and poor differentiation; KDR, ABL1, and MET and age; and SMO and CCND2 and pT stages.Conclusions: Our MLPA and FISH data showed that FGFR1 amplification is a common event, occurring in 15-27.2% of LSCCs. Other amplified genes may be also candidate targets for the treatment of LSCC.","title":"FGFR1 amplification as a druggable target in lung squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-1913"}
