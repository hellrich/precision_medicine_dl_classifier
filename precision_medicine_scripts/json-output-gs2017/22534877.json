The aim of the present follow-up association analysis was to confirm five of these eight loci (single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the CTLA4, IL-2RA, and HLA regions were not included due to previous own findings) and test 12 other loci from the GWAS, which did not surpass the threshold for genome-wide significance. Twenty-three SNPs from the 17 loci were investigated using a sample of 1,702 Central European AA patients and 1,723 controls. Of the five loci with previously reported genome-wide significance, association was confirmed for all of these: ULBP3/ULBP6, PRDX5, IL-2/IL-21, STX17, and IKZF4/ERBB3 (P-value \u003c0.05). To detect robust evidence for association among the 12 other loci, a meta-analysis of the present association data and the data of the recent GWAS was performed. Genome-wide significant association was found for rs20541 (P(comb)\u003d7.52 × 10(-10); odds ratio (OR)\u003d1.30 (1.23-1.38)) and rs998592 (P(comb)\u003d1.11 × 10(-11); OR\u003d1.28 (1.21-1.36)), thus establishing IL-13 and KIAA0350/CLEC16A as susceptibility loci for AA. Interestingly, IL-13 and KIAA0350/CLEC16A are susceptibility loci for other autoimmune diseases, supporting the hypothesis of shared pathways of autoimmune susceptibility.","title":"Follow-up study of the first genome-wide association scan in alopecia areata: IL13 and KIAA0350 as susceptibility loci supported with genome-wide significance.","pubmedId":"22534877"}
