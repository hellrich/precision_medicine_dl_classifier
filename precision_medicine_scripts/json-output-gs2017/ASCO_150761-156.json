Methods:  Advanced gynecologic tumor (GYNT) patients (pts) were analyzed in our Molecular Prescreening Program for MA: mutations (mt) detected with Sequenom (Sq) or VHIO Card Amplicon Seq Panel (VCASP), Notch and PI3K amplifications (amp), PTEN loss (Hscore  50) and PDL1 expression. Pts were allocated to Phase I trials with MTT based on MA. Time to treatment failure (TTF) with MTT (TTF2) was compared to TTF with the previous unmatched therapy (TTF1).  Results:  From Jan 2012 to Dec 2014, 129 GYNT pts (mean age: 52.6 yrs; median no. previous treatments: 3 [0-7]) were screened for MA; 87 ovarian (OC; 23 type I, 64 type II), 27 endometrial (EC; 15 type I, 12 type II) and 15 cervical (CC) cancers. Of 69 pts with MA (53.5%), 33 received MTT (47.8%) including one OC pt treated with 2 consecutive MTT. MA were identified in 15 type I and 27 type II OC pts; mt in PI3KCA (9), KRAS (7), BRAF (2), TP53 (8), amp in Notch (8) and PI3K (1), PTEN loss (18) and PDL1+ (3). In 12 type I and 9 type II EC, mt in PIK3CA (4), KRAS (8), TP53 (2), PTEN (2), FGFR1 (1), ESR1 (1) and ABL1 (1), PTEN loss (13) and PDL1+ (2) were found. KRAS (2), PI3K/AKT(2) mt and PDL1+ (2) were detected in CC. Two Sq wild-type pts tested with VCASP held TP53 mt.  Of 16 PIK3CA MA pts, 6 were treated with -specific PI3Ki, 1 with PI3K/mTORi and 3 with -PI3Ki combined with IGFR1 or FGFRi. KRAS mt pts (17) were matched to MEKi-based combos: 7 MEK/PI3Ki, 2 MEK/AKTi and 1 MEK/IGFR1i. Multiple MA in a type I OC pt (KRAS/BRAF mt) were treated with PI3K/MEKi, a type I EC pt (PIK3CA/KRAS mt) with mTORi, and a type II EC pt (TP53/FGFR1/ABL1 mt) with MET/FGFR/AXLi. Of 10 TP53mt, 1 PTEN loss pt received PI3Ki. Notch-i was offered to 5 of 8 amp OC and anti-PD1/PDL1 agents to 3 of 6 PDL1+ GYNT. Although no differences were found between TTF1 and TTF2 (17.8 vs 15.0 wks, p \u003d 0.156), TTF2/TTF1 was \u003e 1.2 in 11 of 34 MTT (32.4%).  Conclusions:  Albeit statistical significance was not reached, TTF improved in \u003e 30% of pts meriting further evaluation of MTT in GYNT. More time is needed to elucidate the impact of genetic/proteomic tumor profiling in drug development of GYNT.","title":"Early drug development in advanced gynecologic cancer based on genetic tumor profiling.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150761-156"}
