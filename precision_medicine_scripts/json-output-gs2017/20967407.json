In case of lung cancer in clinical stage I to IIb and T3N1 surgical treatment is recommended. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated in stage II and IIIa. In case of limited N2-disease trimodality therapy with chemo- or radiochemotherapy followed by surgery and eventual adjuvant radiotherapy leads to five year survival rate of about 20-40. Non resectable or extended mediastinal lymph node metastases are an indication for definite combined radiochemotherapy. Secondary resection may be evaluated in experienced centers. If the tumor has infiltrated the mediastinum or the upper sulcus (T3/4) or in case of solitary metastasis an individual trimodal treatment plan has to be elaborated. Also for small cell lung cancer surgery combined with chemotherapy can be applied in stage I and II, else and especially in stage III radiochemotherapy should be applied. Additional prophylactic cranial irradiation is used. The majority of lung cancer patients suffers from metastatic disease. The value of systemic chemotherapy is limited with significant, but small improvement in overall survival. Also treatment with the new molecularly targeted drugs does not result in a breakthrough in unselected patient cohorts. Recently, substantial progress could be achieved by personalized treatment approaches for patients harbouring special genetic alterations.","title":"[Multimodality therapy for lung cancer].","pubmedId":"20967407"}
