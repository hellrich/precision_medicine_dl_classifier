The expression status of BAG family genes are related to certain tumor incidence and prognosis. The aim of this study is to explore the association of the BAG family gene expression status with the susceptibility of lung adenocarcinoma.\nThe gene expression data of BAG family genes from 29 cases of lung adenocarcinoma tissues and matched pericancerous lung tissues were generated by microarray chips. Cox regression was used to analyze the association between the expression of BAG family genes and the susceptibility of lung adenocarcinoma and the results were verified by GEO database.\nThe expression levels of BAG-1, BAG-2, BAG-5 in cancer tissues were significantly downregulated compared with matched pericancerous lung tissues and were protective factors of lung adenocarcinoma (P \u003c 0.05, OR \u003c 1); while the expression level of BAG-4 in cancer tissues were remarkably upregulated compared with the matched pericancerous lung tissues and was risk factor of lung adenocarcinoma (P \u003c 0.05, OR \u003e 1).\nBAG-1, BAG-2, BAG-5 might be the potential protective factors while BAG-4 is possible risk factor of lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"[BAG family gene and its relationship with lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility].","pubmedId":"20959066"}
