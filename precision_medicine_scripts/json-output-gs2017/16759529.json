The correlation among these 3 genes was analyzed.\np53, p16, and COX-2 were all significantly highly expressed in the cancerous tissues in comparison with other tissues. P53 and p16 were both significantly correlated with COX-2 (both P \u003c 0.05), however, there was not a correlation between p53 and p16 (P \u003e 0.05). There was a reciprocal relationship between p53 and COX-2 (P \u003c 0.05, OR \u003d 19.686) influencing the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.\nTissue microarray technique is effective method to detect multiple gene protein expression. Pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer is associated with p53, p16, and COX-2.","title":"[Detection of expression of p53, p16, and cyclooxygenase 2 in pancreatic cancer by tissue microarray and correlation among these three genes].","pubmedId":"16759529"}
