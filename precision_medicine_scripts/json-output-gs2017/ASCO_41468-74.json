It is based on hepatic arterial infusion of resin microspheres containing the pure -emitter Yttrium-90. The goal of this cohort analysis was evaluate the clinical efficacy of SIRT and to define biomarkers predicting response to this new option. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 40 pts with breast cancer (39 female, 1 male) at a median age of 60.3 yrs (31-73 yrs) who had received SIRT for metastatic liver disease from 2002-2009. We used survival analysis techniques (Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox regression models) for this exploratory study. Results: 13 pts (33.3%) were premenopausal, 23 (59.0%) postmenopausal, and 3 (7.7%) perimenopausal; 14 pts (36.8%) overexpressed HER2/neu; 27 pts (71.1%) were hormone receptor positive; 39 pts (97.5%) had received previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease, 34 (87.2%) hormone therapy. 37 pts (94.9%) had received anthracyclines, and 34 (89.5%) taxanes before SIRT. Median time from diagnosis of breast cancer to SIRT was 6.8 yrs (1.1-27.3 yrs). In 19 pts (47.5%), metastasis was limited to the liver, 21 (52.5%) pts had liver-predominant metastasis (21 bone, 7 non-regional lymph nodes, 4 lung, 5 others). Overall response rate (ORR) in the liver was 45.5% (95% CI: 0.29-0.62). Stable disease for more than 8 weeks was achieved in 12.1% of pts. Median PFS in the liver was 3.3 mo (1.8-32.8 mo), and median TTP 3.5 mo (1.8-32.8 mo). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.2 mo. Bivariate Cox regression models (using the Wald test) for baseline biomarkers before SIRT revealed a significant correlation of CEA (p\u003d0.022), CA 15-3 (p\u003d0.006), and LDH (p\u003d0.012) with OS. No correlation was observed for C-reactive protein levels (p\u003d0.74). Conclusions: This analysis of SIRT applied in breast cancer pts with metastatic liver disease indicates substantial clinical activity of this treatment option in highly pretreated breast cancer pts. CEA, CA 15-3, and LDH baseline levels in serum before SIRT appear to be predictors for OS.","title":"Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) for treatment of patients with breast cancer with metastatic liver disease.","pubmedId":"ASCO_41468-74"}
