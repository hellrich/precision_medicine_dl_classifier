Median survival after complete resection is commonly less than 20 months and the 5 years survival is in the range of about 20%. Postoperative radiochemotherapy reduces the local recurrence rate but not the overall survival however. Pancreatic carcinoma is characterized by a low chemosensitivity of the drugs commonly used like 5-FU. More aggressive chemotherapy protocols are limited by the reduced status of the patient. Multimodal and prolonged adjuvant schedules did not show a prognostic benefit. The current ESPAC--study investigates the role of simultaneous radiotherapy and 5-FU alone or in combination with neoadjuvant 5-FU and folic acid for 6 months. New protocols will investigate the value of regional adjuvant chemotherapy ESPAC 2) [44] and of gemcitabine, 5-FU or control in a three arm study.--In a multicenter German trial the benefit of gemcitabene as weekly monotherapy for 6 months is investigated. The treatment starts soon after resection due to low toxicity and good patient compliance.","title":"[Adjuvant therapy of pancreatic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"11142141"}
