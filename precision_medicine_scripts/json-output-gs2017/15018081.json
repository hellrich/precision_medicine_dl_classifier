The standard therapeutic options for localised prostate cancer remain radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy. However, some minimally invasive treatments are being investigated, including high intensity focused ultrasound and cryotherapy. In the future these therapies may replace standard treatments in selected patients. On the other hand, only few advances have been made in the treatment of non-localised prostate cancer. Locally advanced cancer is treated with combination of radiotherapy and hormonotherapy, and metastatic cancer is treated with hormone therapy. Docetaxel may improve patient survival in hormone-refractory disease.","title":"[Therapeutic options and controversies in the management of prostate cancer].","pubmedId":"15018081"}
