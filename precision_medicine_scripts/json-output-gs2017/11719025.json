PDAC is also one of the best-studied cancers with regard to molecular pathogenesis. The chief risk factors associated with PDAC are smoking and pancreatitis, in addition genetic predisposition seems to play a major role. This genetic predisposition may in some cases be indirect, for example via the elevated risk of pancreatitis seen in patients with hereditary pancreatitis (HP). The elucidation of the molecular causes of PDAC has enabled the provision of secondary screening for PDAC in conditions such as HP. This review is concerned with the molecular pathogenesis of PDAC and the application of this basic scientific understanding into state-of-the-art clinical practice.","title":"Molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and clinical implications.","pubmedId":"11719025"}
