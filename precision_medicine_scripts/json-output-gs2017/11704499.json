The actions of bFGF are mediated by four different transmembrane receptors (FGFR1-4). Among them, FGFR1 has a high affinity for bFGF, and gain-of-function mutations of the FGFR1 gene cause craniosynostosis in humans. Gene expression for FGFR1 has been analyzed in embryogenesis; however, in skeletal repair, detailed expression of FGFR1 has not been fully established. In the present study, a rat model of closed femoral fracture healing was used to quantify mRNA encoding the FGFR1 and to characterize cells expressing FGFR1 by in situ hybridization. Gene expression for FGFR1 was rapidly upregulated after fracture; its mRNA level on day 1 was 3.4-fold higher than that of unfractured femora. At this stage, a moderate signal for FGFR1 was detected in periosteal osteoprogenitor cells, inflammatory cells near fracture sites, and cells among muscle layers. FGFR1 mRNA reached peak expression when callus remodeling actively progressed (6.8-fold on day 14), and remained elevated even in the later stages of healing (6.3-fold on day 28). During the intermediate stage of fracture healing, a strong signal for FGFR1 was diffusely distributed in mature osteoblasts in the hard callus, and mature osteoclasts also expressed a weak signal for FGFR1. These results suggest that FGF/FGFR1 signaling has multifunctional roles during fracture healing and may regulate both osteoblasts and osteoclasts, contributing to bone formation and callus remodeling.","title":"Spatial and temporal gene expression for fibroblast growth factor type I receptor (FGFR1) during fracture healing in the rat.","pubmedId":"11704499"}
