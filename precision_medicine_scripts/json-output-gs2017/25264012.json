CAIII concentration of femoris quadriceps specimens was quantitatively determined using Western blot methods, CAIIImRNA expression levels of femoris quadriceps specimens were also quantitatively measured using RT-PCR, then compared among the 3 groups.\nThere was significant difference in CAIII quantitative concentration and CAIIImRNA expression level in each group (P \u003c 0.05) , further more, CAIII concentration expression level was significantly higher (P \u003c 0.01) in SMA group (1.260 ± 0.068) than in SMNA group (1.110 ± 0.014) , the latter was significantly higher (P \u003c 0.01) than in the control group (1.000 ± 0.062) . CAIIImRNA expression level was significantly higher (P \u003c 0.01) in SMNA group (2.170 ± 0.412) than in the control group (1.000 ± 0.115) , and was significantly lower than in SMA group (3.770 ± 0.788; P \u003c 0.01). CAIII concentration and CAIIImRNA expression level increased at equal pace in SMNA group and SMA group, however, CAIII quantitative concentration and CAIIImRNA expression level were inconsistent in the two groups.\nThe expression status of CAIII in quadriceps femoris muscle was different in two kinds of muscle clinical phenotype of COPD.","title":"[Carbonic anhydrase III and mRNA expression levels in quadriceps femoris muscle of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients].","pubmedId":"25264012"}
