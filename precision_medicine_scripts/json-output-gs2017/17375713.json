Radical surgery is possible in about two-thirds of the patients, and the prognosis of patients with inoperable tumors is dismal. Only a few cases of liposarcoma complicating pregnancy have been documented. We report a case of a patient who was diagnosed with metastatic abdominal liposarcoma during the third trimester of the pregnancy. After induced vaginal delivery, palliative surgery was performed and one cycle of systemic combination chemotherapy was administered. Despite the multimodality treatment the patient died of progressive disease within one month after diagnosis. Autopsy revealed high-grade pleomorphic liposarcoma arising from the retroperitoneum with liver and lung metastases.","title":"Fulminant course of metastatic liposarcoma after delivery--case report.","pubmedId":"17375713"}
