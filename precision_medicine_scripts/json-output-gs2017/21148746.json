The purpose of this study was to identify genetic alterations that define prognosis of patients with early-stage lung ADC.\nRegions of copy number alterations in 65 small-sized lung ADCs and 40 ADC cell lines were determined by using GeneChip Human Mapping 10-K and 250-K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, respectively. A copy number assay based on real-time genomic PCR (RT-G-PCR) was done for 60 small-sized lung ADCs and 162 stage I lung ADCs.\nSeveral regions on chromosomes 5p, 7p, 8q, and 14q were frequently (\u003e10%) amplified in both small-sized ADCs and lung ADC cell lines. In particular, the MYC gene was mapped in the minimum common region at chromosome 8q24.21, and therefore was indicated to be a target of gene amplification in lung ADCs. MYC amplification correlated with poor prognosis (P \u003d 0.031) of patients with small-sized ADCs. MYC amplification detected by SNP array analysis was well reproduced by RT-G-PCR analysis. Therefore, to investigate the utility of MYC amplification as a prognostic marker for early-stage lung ADCs, 162 stage I lung ADCs were subjected to the analysis. MYC amplification was associated with relapse-free survival in these patients (P \u003d 0.013 by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis).\nThese results strongly indicate that MYC amplification is a prognostic marker of patients with early-stage lung ADCs.","title":"MYC amplification as a prognostic marker of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma identified by whole genome copy number analysis.","pubmedId":"21148746"}
