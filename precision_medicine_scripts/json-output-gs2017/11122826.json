Advances in gene transfer technology have allowed gene therapy strategies to develop that act in such a way as to stimulate the immune system, transfer \"suicide\" genes, inactivate oncogenes, replace tumor suppressor genes, and transfer pro-apoptotic genes. Clinical trials evaluating these possibilities have begun, and findings indicate that the transfer of tumor sup- pressor genes (wild-type p53) is feasible and has low overall toxicity. Subsequent clinical trials have begun to evaluate the clinical potential of these approaches in non-small-cell lung cancer.","title":"Gene therapy in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"11122826"}
