A case of a locally advanced, pulmonary mixed liposarcoma in a 49-year-old male is presented here. Left pneumonectomy with radical lymph node dissection was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful and no recurrence or metastasis was observed for 3 years. Although liposarcoma of the lung is classified as an aggressive, highly metastatic disease, complete resection may result in disease-free survival.","title":"Primary pulmonary liposarcoma--a case report.","pubmedId":"19241318"}
