New evidence from several phase III trials suggests that the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors improves tumor response rate and progression-free survival (PFS). Some of the serious adverse events, in particular, the incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma seen with the monotherapy treatment with a BRAF inhibitor are attenuated with combination therapy, whereas milder side effects such as pyrexia can be more common with combination therapy. Although dose reductions and dose interruptions are slightly more common with combination therapy, overall data supports the notion that combination therapy is safe and improves the outcomes for metastatic melanoma patients compared to single agent BRAF inhibitors.
