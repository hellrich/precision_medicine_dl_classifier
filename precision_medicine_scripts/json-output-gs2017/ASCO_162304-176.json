We analyzed cfDNA for PIK3CA hotspot mutations to determine their impact on the clinical benefit of exemestane (EXE) or EXE plus EVE from the BOLERO-2 trial that randomized patients (pts) to these two treatment arms (2:1). Methods: Baseline plasma samples were analyzed by ddPCR for H1047R, E545K, and E542K mutations (~85% of activating PIK3CAmutations). Cox-proportional hazards model was used to assess PFS in pt subgroups defined by all or domain specific mutations separately (E545K/E542K for helical and H1047R for kinase domain). Results: 550 of 724 pts (76% trial population) had evaluable genotype results. 238 (43.3%) mutations were identified with frequencies of 25.3%, 11.3% and 7.5% for H1047R, E545K and E542K, respectively. Among 247 pts with PIK3CA genotype derived from sequencing matched archival tumors, the mutation site concordance was 66%. Comparable PFS benefit from adding EVE to EXE was observed in all pts, regardless of their PIK3CA genotypes, consistent with the results from archival tumor analysis (Hortobagyi JCO2015). Furthermore, similar PFS EVE benefits were observed in subgroups defined by mutations in helical and kinase domain separately (Table). In the EXE alone arm, pts with helical domain mutations had decreased PFS, compared to WT [HR 1.56 (CI95% 1.12-2.18)]. Conclusions: Retrospective analysis of cfDNA from BOLERO-2 trial show that PFS benefit from EVE was independent of PIK3CA genotypes at the time of study entry. Analysis of larger populations may identify mutation site differences for disease prognosis and/or predictive for treatment benefit.
