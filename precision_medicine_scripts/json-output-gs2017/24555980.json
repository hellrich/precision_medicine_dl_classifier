All of the 66 patients who showed double or multiple primary cancers or metastatic pancreatic malignancies were included into the PPC group or SMC group, respectively. In addition, PPC patients were compared with 570 patients suffering from pancreatic cancer (PC) alone.\nFor the PPC group (n \u003d 34), the most common previous non-pancreatic cancers were gastric cancer, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer. For the SMC group (n \u003d 32), the most common metastatic tumors were lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and gastric cancer. Multivariate analysis identified age (OR \u003d 1.099; 95% CI, 1.007-1.199), previous tumor type (OR \u003d 1.164; 95% CI, 1.046-1.296), and time interval between two tumors (OR \u003d 1.021; 95% CI, 1.003-1.039) as significant indicators. Significantly better survival times were observed after resection than after cryosurgery in the PPC group (p \u003c 0.001) but not in the SMC group (p \u003d 0.670).\nOverall, primary pancreatic cancers are as common as metastasis to the pancreas in patients with a previous cancer. A longer time interval between two tumors indicates a higher possibility that a new pancreatic cancer will occur. Some cancers (particularly RCC) are more likely to metastasize to the pancreas than other cancers. For metastatic cancers, cryosurgery is as effective as resection as a treatment option.","title":"Resection or cryosurgery relates with pancreatic tumor type: primary pancreatic cancer with previous non-pancreatic cancer or secondary metastatic cancer within the pancreas.","pubmedId":"24555980"}
