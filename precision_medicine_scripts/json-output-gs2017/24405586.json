However, the relationship between dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), a 5-FU degrading enzyme, and EGFR mutation status is unknown. Here, we focus on clinicopathologic factors and in vitro correlations between DPD expression and EGFR mutation status.\nEGFR mutations and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of DPD and thymidylate synthase (TS) were analyzed in 47 resected NSCLC tumors by laser-capture microdissection. In addition, relationships between EGFR mutation status and the immunohistochemical expression of DPD and TS in 49 patients with primary NSCLC who were treated with a 5-FU derivative of S-1 postoperatively were examined. Correlations among clinicopathologic factors were evaluated. The effect of epidermal growth factor on DPD expression was also investigated in vitro in various cell lines.\nAdenocarcinoma in situ showed significantly higher DPD mRNA levels and more EGFR mutation frequency than other histological types (P \u003c .05). DPD immunopositive cases were more frequently observed in adenocarcinoma, in females, and in nonsmokers. DPD immunopositive cases were correlated with EGFR mutation status (P \u003c .003). The prognoses of wild-type EGFR and mutated EGFR populations were similarly favorable with postoperative S-1 treatment, which overcomes the problem of 5-FU degradation in mutated EGFR. In vitro, EGFR-mutated cell lines showed high DPD mRNA and protein expression.\nHigh DPD expression was shown to be correlated with EGFR mutation in adenocarcinoma cells and tissues. Clinicians should take this finding into consideration when using 5-FU to treat patients with NSCLC.","title":"High expression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase in lung adenocarcinoma is associated with mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor: implications for the treatment of non--small-cell lung cancer using 5-fluorouracil.","pubmedId":"24405586"}
