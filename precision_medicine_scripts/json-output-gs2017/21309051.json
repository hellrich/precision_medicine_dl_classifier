Sub-clinical inflammation may play a role in the transition from gestational diabetes to type 2 diabetes; the role of the autonomic nervous system as a mediating system has been raised. We aimed to study the association of the sympathetic nervous system and sub-clinical inflammation in women with gestational diabetes.\nWe studied 41 Caucasian women with gestational diabetes and 22 healthy pregnant and 14 non-pregnant controls. We assayed plasma noradrenaline, insulin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, insulin growth factor-1, serum amyloid A, steroid hormone-binding globulin, α-1 acid glycoprotein and cortisol at 2400, 0400 and 0700 h.\nNo differences existed in the concentrations of inflammatory markers between gestational diabetes and normal pregnancy but women with gestational diabetes showed loss of variation in C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A. Levels of hormone-binding globulin were lower in hypertensive compared with normotensive women with gestational diabetes at all time points and lowest at midnight when α-1 acid glycoprotein levels were higher in hypertensive women.\nGestational diabetes is associated with loss of natural variation of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A, suggesting altered modulation of inflammation. Hypertension in gestational diabetes seems not to be associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers other than α-1 acid glycoprotein.","title":"Decreased variation of inflammatory markers in gestational diabetes.","pubmedId":"21309051"}
