LKB1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Patients were followed-up and prognostic factors were evaluated.\nLKB1 expression was decreased in the HCC samples. Loss of LKB1 expression in HCC was significantly related to histologic grade (P\u003d0.010), vascular invasion (P\u003d0.025) and TMN stage (P\u003d0.011). Patients showing negative LKB1 expression had a significantly shorter disease-free and overall survival than those with positive expression (P \u003d 0.001, P\u003d0.000, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that LKB1 expression level was an independent factor of survival (P \u003d 0.033).\nHCC patients with decreased expression LKB1 have a poor prognosis. The loss of LKB1 expression is correlated with a lower survival rate.","title":"Decreased expression of LKB1 correlates with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing hepatectomy.","pubmedId":"23679304"}
