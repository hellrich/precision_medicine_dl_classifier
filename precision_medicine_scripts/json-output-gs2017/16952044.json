After surgery, he was treated with 400 mg/day of imatinib, without recurrence, for 26 months. At 26 months, the imatinib dose was reduced because of nausea, and 4 months after the dose reduction, recurrence of GIST was detected, for which surgical resection was performed again. The first surgical specimen had a mutation of exon 11 in the c-kit receptor gene. Intriguingly, the second surgical specimen had a novel mutation of exon 17, in addition to the above-mentioned mutation, in the c-kit receptor gene. Based on the result of molecular analysis, the novel mutation of exon 17, induced by longterm chemotherapy, was judged to have been responsible for the recurrence, which perhaps was triggered by the dose reduction of imatinib.","title":"Recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) of the stomach associated with a novel c-kit mutation after imatinib treatment.","pubmedId":"16952044"}
