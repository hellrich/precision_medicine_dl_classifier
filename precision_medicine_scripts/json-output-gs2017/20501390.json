The rats received subcutaneous injection of D-galactose for 6 weeks to establish the aging models, and another 6 rats were injected daily with normal saline (NS) to serve as the normal control group. From the third week of the experiment, the rats were given oral OR or Vitamin E (VE) accordingly till the sixth week. After completion of the drug administration, all the rats were sacrificed for detecting the expressions of CyclinD1, CDK6 and P15 in the liver tissue by Western blotting.\nThe relative expression levels of CyclinD1, CDK6 and P15 in the liver of the rats in the OR group were 41.73-/+0.54, 23.29-/+0.30 and 1.49-/+0.30, respectively, significantly up-regulated as compared with those in the ageing model group (P\u003c0.01). The expressions of the proteins were obviously down-regulated in the model group in comparison with those in the normal control group.\nOR treatment can lower the expressions of Cyclin D1 and CDK6 in the liver to enhance the liver cell proliferation in aged male rats. OR also promotes the expression of P15 through a feedback mechanism to prevent excessive proliferation of the cells. The effect of OR against ageing is mediated possibly by up-regulation of the proteins associated with the cell proliferation in the liver, a mechanism different from that of VE.","title":"[Effect of Oviductus Ranae on Cyclin D1, CDK6 and P15 expressions in the liver tissue of aged male rats].","pubmedId":"20501390"}
