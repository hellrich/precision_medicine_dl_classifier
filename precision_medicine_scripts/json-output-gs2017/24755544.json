Neoangiogenesis plays an important role in the growth of various solid cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma. Vascular endothelial growth factor plays an important role in tumor-induced angiogenesis and its expression is associated with the progression and prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma. This study examined whether axitinib (AG-013736, INLYTA(Â®)), a potent and selective second-generation inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3, could be a potentially useful therapeutic agent for cholangiocarcinoma.\nWe performed expression profiling of angiogenesis-related molecules in eight cholangiocarcinoma cell lines and found that three of them showed high vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Among them, we examined the in vivo anti-tumor effect of axitinib on NCC-BD1 (a gemcitabine-sensitive extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell line) and TKKK (a gemcitabine-resistant intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell line) using subcutaneous xenograft models.\nOral administration of axitinib significantly inhibited the growth of TKKK xenografts at a dose of 6 mg kg(-1) day(-1) (P\u003c0.05), and the growth of NCC-BD1 xenografts at 30 mg kg(-1)day(-1) (P\u003c0.05). Treated tumors showed a significant decrease of microvessel density and the tumor cell proliferation index and a mild but significant increase of the apoptotic index in comparison with untreated tumors.\nOur results suggest that axitinib should be a promising therapy for vascular endothelial growth factor-expressing cholangiocarcinoma, irrespective of tumor origin and gemcitabine sensitivity.","title":"Axitinib (AG-013736), an oral specific VEGFR TKI, shows potential therapeutic utility against cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24755544"}
