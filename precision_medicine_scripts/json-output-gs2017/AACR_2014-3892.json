Here, we examined the inhibitory effects of nestin expression using nestin-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) in pancreatic cancer cells. We also investigated the regulatory mechanism of nestin expression in pancreatic cancer. Methods: siRNA targeting nestin was transfected to the pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and PK-45H, and we analyzed the effect on cell behaviors including proliferation, migration, invasion, sphere-forming ability, and sensitivity to gemcitabine. Next, to clarify the mechanisms of nestin expression, pancreatic cancer cells were injected into the spleen of NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Sug/Jic (NOG) mice, and pancreatic cancer cells were also collected from metastatic foci of NOG mice. We compared the methylation status of the promoter and the 1st and 2nd introns of the nestin gene in metastatic and parental cancer cells using bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing.Results: Nestin siRNA inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and sphere-forming ability of the pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Co-treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with gemcitabine and nestin siRNA decreased cell viability compared to administration of gemcitabine or nestin siRNA alone. Cells derived from the metastatic nodules of NOG mice showed higher expression of nestin compared with parental cells, and methylation of the nestin promoter and the 1st and 2nd introns was lower in the metastatic cells. Compared to control siRNA-treated mice, nestin siRNA significantly inhibited primary and metastatic tumor formation derived from human pancreatic cancer cells in an orthotopic implantation model using NOG mice.In summary, decreasing nestin expression in pancreatic cancer cells using nestin siRNA suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and sphere formation in vitro and primary and metastatic tumor formation in vivo. Furthermore, nestin siRNA had synergistic effects with gemcitabine in inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell growth. These findings suggest that nestin plays a key role in pancreatic cancer cell metastasis and stemness, and that administration of nestin siRNA is a novel therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.","title":"Inhibitory effects and regulatory mechanism of nestin in pancreatic cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3892"}
