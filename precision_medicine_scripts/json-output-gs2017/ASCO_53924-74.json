HSP can be induced at elevated temperatures and when released into the extracellular environment following cell necrosis, act as immunomodulatory molecules attracting antigen- presenting cells (APCs) to the sites of immunogenetic peptides. Previous studies have isolated hsp from autologous melanoma tumor cells in vitro and then re-inoculated into patients as exogenous therapeutic vaccines. Heating of cells by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been shown to upregulate hsp expression in vivo. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a commercially available cytokine that works as an immune adjuvant by mediating dendritic cell (DC) maturation, increasing surface expression of MHC class I and II molecules of DCs, and enhancing antibody responses to known immunogens. In this feasibility study, we attempt to create an endogenous hsp vaccine in patients with metastatic melanoma through the use of sublethal radiofrequency treatment (RFT) supplemented with intra-lesional GM-CSF plus or minus subsequent cell killing with either RFA or cryoablation. Methods: With institutional review board approval, consenting HLA-A2 positive patients with metastatic melanoma (liver or soft tissue) are sequentially placed into one of three cohorts with three patients in each cohort. Cohort 1 receives sublethal RFT (42C for 30 minutes) to the target lesion followed by intra-lesional injection of 500 mcg of GM-CSF. Cohort 2 receives sublethal RFT to the target lesion, followed by standard RFA to the target lesion, followed by intra-lesional injection of 500 mcg of GM-CSF. Cohort 3 receives sublethal RFT to the target lesion, followed by cryotherapy, followed by intra-lesional injection of 500 mcg of GM-CSF. In all cohorts, hsp70 (and multiple cytokines) are measured in the peripheral blood at baseline and every three hours for the first 24 hours post procedure. Melanoma specific tetramer analysis is performed on peripheral blood prior to procedure, 3 weeks and 6 weeks postprocedure to evaluate for the primary endpoint of melanoma specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) production. Clinical outcomes will be correlated with laboratory findings.","title":"Endogenous heat-shock protein vaccines for metastatic melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_53924-74"}
