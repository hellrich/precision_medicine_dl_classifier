Here we present a case of reconstruction of a severe postraumatic radial club hand with a free fibular osteoseptocutaneous flap and Sauve-Kapandji procedure in a 28-year-old man. The patient had a radial deviation of the wrist and right upper limb shortening as a result of an infected pseudarthrosis of the radius. This deformity was reconstructed with a free fibular osteoseptocutaneous flap associated to arthrodesis of the distal radioulnar joint and an ulnar resection osteotomy proximal to the arthrodesis in order to restore rotation of the forearm (Sauvé-Kapandji procedure). The flap fully survived and no complications were seen in the early postoperative period at both recipient and donor sites. Radius alignment was restored. At 5-month follow-up, the skeleton was healed. There was minimal osteopenia at the distal radial segment. Wrist extension was 48 degrees, flexion 24 degrees, and pronation-supination was 58-0-48 degrees, with full finger flexion. The patient could hold a 4 kg dumbbell with the elbow flexed without discomfort. His DASH score-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire was 15.83. Combined free fibular osteoseptocutaneous flap and Sauve-Kapandji procedure may be considered in severe forms of postraumatic radial club hand, however, further data are necessary. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
