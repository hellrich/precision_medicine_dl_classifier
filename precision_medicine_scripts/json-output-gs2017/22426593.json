Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) is a major transporter responsible for gemcitabine uptake into cells. This study was conducted to elucidate the association between expression level of hENT1 and outcome for pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy including gemcitabine.\nSixty-three patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by curative surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas were included. Immunohistochemistry was performed using resected specimens and the staining intensity of hENT1 was scored as having no staining, low staining, or high staining; the former two were defined as negative expression of hENT1. The association between expression level of hENT1 and overall survival was evaluated by Cox proportional regression model.\nExpression level of hENT1 was evaluated as positive in 22 (35%) patients, and as negative in 41 (65%) patients. Univariate analysis showed that regional lymph node metastasis, vascular permeation, and perineural invasion are prognostic factors; however, expression level of hENT1 did not reach statistical significance. Multivariate analysis showed only vascular permeation as a prognostic factor.\nExpression level of hENT1 was not associated with prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients who were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation including gemcitabine.","title":"Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 level does not predict prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation including gemcitabine.","pubmedId":"22426593"}
