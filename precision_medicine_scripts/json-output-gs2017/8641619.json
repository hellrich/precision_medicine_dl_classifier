A retrospective analysis of 176 patients with cervical carcinoma FIGO stage IB treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy from 1987 to 1990 was conducted. Immunohistochemical staining using the polyclonal nm23-H1/NDP kinase A antibody was correlated to various histopathological and morphological characteristics (tumor size, histologic type, grade of differentiation, vessel invasion, invasion into parametria, and lymph node metastasis) and relapse-free survival. For controls, sections were obtained from 10 hysterectomy specimens with normal cervical epithelium. Staining for nm23/NDP kinase was observed in 90% of control cases and in 70.5% of cases of cervical carcinoma, more frequent in squamous and adenosquamous cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma and more frequent in poorly differentiated than in more highly differentiated tumors. There were no differences related to size of tumor or invasion into vessels or parametria or occurrence of lymph node metastasis. The relapse-free survival was lower for patients with squamous cell and adenosquamous tumors with positive immunostaining for nm23/NDP kinase than for those with negative tumors when evaluated in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis with tumor size, vessel invasion, invasion into parametria, grade of differentiation, and lymph node metastasis included, this difference was no longer significant. In patients with adenocarcinoma no difference was found. In conclusion, we did not find immunostaining for nm23/NDP kinase to be a useful indicator for prognosis in cancer of the uterine cervix.","title":"Evaluation of the prognostic significance of nm23/NDP kinase protein expression in cervical carcinoma: an immunohistochemical study.","pubmedId":"8641619"}
