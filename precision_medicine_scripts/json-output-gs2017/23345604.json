However, the underlying mechanism is not clear. This study aimed to determine the relationship between Substance P (SP) and pancreatic cancer perineural invasion (PNI) as well as the mechanism of SP mediating pancreatic cancer PNI, which causes pain in patients with pancreatic cancer. Human pancreatic cancer cells and newborn dorsal root ganglions (DRG) were used to determine the expression of SP or NK-1R in pancreatic cancer cells and DRGs cells by QT-PCR and Western blotting. The effects of SP on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasion were analyzed using MTT assay and Transwell Matrigel invasion assay, respectively. Alterations in the neurotropism of pancreatic cancer cells were assessed by coculture system, which mimics the interaction of tumor/neuron in vivo. SP is not only widely distributed in the neurite outgrowth from newborn DRGs but also expressed in MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells. NK-1R is found to be overexpressed in the pancreatic cancer cell lines examined. SP induces cancer cell proliferation and invasion as well as the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in pancreatic cancer cells, and NK-1R antagonists inhibit these effects. Furthermore, SP promotes neurite outgrowth and the migration of pancreatic cancer cell cluster to the DRGs, which is blocked by NK-1R antagonists in the coculture model. Our results suggest that SP plays an important role in the development of pancreatic cancer metastasis and PNI, and blocking the SP/NK-1R signaling system is a novel strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Neurotransmitter substance P mediates pancreatic cancer perineural invasion via NK-1R in cancer cells.","pubmedId":"23345604"}
