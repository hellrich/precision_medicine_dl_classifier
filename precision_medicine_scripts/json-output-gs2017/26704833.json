The presence of ROS1 fusion gene in correlation with clinicopathologic features was analyzed. Sixteen positive and 20 negative samples by RT-PCR were further confirmed by direct sequencing.\nROS1 fusion gene was detected in 16 of 369 lung adenocarcinoma samples (4.3%). The presence of ROS1 fusion gene was not correlated to gender, age, smoking history, tumor site, size, histological subtype, tumor differentiation, T staging, lymph node metastasis, TNM staging and EGFR mutation (P \u003e 0.05). The frequency of ROS1 fusion gene was similar in female and male patients, 4.4% (8/183) vs 4.3% (8/186), P \u003e 0.05. The presence of ROS1 fusion gene in patients of â‰¤ 60 years of age was higher than that in patients of \u003e 60 years, 5.1% (10/195) vs 3.4% (6/174), P \u003e 0.05. The rate of ROS1 fusion gene of non-smokers was a slight higher than that of smokers, 4.4% (14/318) vs 3.9% (2/51), P \u003e 0.05. Both positive and negative cases were confirmed by direct sequencing in all cases.\nROS1 fusion gene occurs more frequently in younger and non-smoking patients of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, and may coexist with EGFR mutations. ROS1 fusion gene seems to define a distinct subset of pulmonary adenocarcinoma.","title":"[Detection of ROS1 fusion gene in pulmonary adenocarcinoma and its clinicopathologic features].","pubmedId":"26704833"}
