Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas in cirrhosis and precirrhotic liver (ICC-cirrhosis) are increasingly being diagnosed, and can display hypervascular enhancement resembling a hepatocellular carcinoma on dynamic imaging.\nIn this study using ICC-cirrhosis (71 cases), ICC with non-specific reactive changes (ICC-reactive) (72 cases) and the cholangiocarcinoma component of combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-ICC) (30 cases), we tried to compare the tumour vasculature.\nIt was found that ICC-cirrhosis and the cholangiocarcinoma component of HCC-ICC showed a higher density of arteries and microvessels (1.59 ± 0.58/mm(2) (mean ± SD) and 140 ± 43/mm(2) in ICC-cirrhosis and 1.74 ± 0.67/mm(2) and 131 ± 46/mm(2) in the cholangiocarcinoma component of HCC-ICC) than in ICC-reactive (1.26 ± 0.61/mm(2) and 103 ± 45/mm(2) ). Dynamic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that a majority of ICC-cirrhosis displayed strong hypervascular enhancement, whereas one-third of ICC-reactive each showed strong, weak and no or minimal enhancement respectively. The increased vascular density was positively correlated with enhanced arterial phase of dynamic CT and MRI.\nThe density of arteries and microvessels of ICC-cirrhosis was higher than that in ICC-reactive and comparable to that in the cholangiocarcinoma component of HCC-ICC, and the higher density of arteries and microvessels in ICC may be responsible for the hypervascular enhancement of ICC-cirrhosis.","title":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas in cirrhosis are hypervascular in comparison with those in normal livers.","pubmedId":"22417172"}
