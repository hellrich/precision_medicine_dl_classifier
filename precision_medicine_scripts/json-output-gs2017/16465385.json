Despite the ability of p53 to significantly inhibit tumor growth in preclinical models, it has met with more limited clinical success. This is due, in part, to the observation that a substantial fraction of tumors are resistant to the effects of p53 expression. We have tested whether combination therapy with Thoc1/p84 and p53 is more effective than single gene therapy in a p53-resistant tumor model of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Infection with Thoc1/p84 and p53 adenovirus inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo to a greater extent than treatment with either one alone at the same total viral dose. Similar results are observed with Thoc1/p84 and Rb1 gene therapy. The data support the use of therapy that targets both the p53 and Thoc1/p84 pathways in tumors that are resistant to perturbation of the p53 pathway alone.","title":"Combination gene therapy with p53 and Thoc1/p84 is more effective than either single agent in an animal model of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"16465385"}
