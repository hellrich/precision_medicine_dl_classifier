Gain-of-function mutations in the juxtamembrane domain of the c-kit gene have been found in several GISTs. In this study, we examined the correlation between the presence of c-kit mutation and prognosis in 124 cases of GIST. DNA samples were extracted from paraffin sections. Exon 11 of the c-kit gene encoding the juxtamembrane domain and exon 17 encoding the kinase domain were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Most GISTs (89%) express the KIT protein, and missense mutations of exon 11 were found in 71 of 124 GISTs (57%). No mutations were detectable in exon 17. These 71 mutation-positive GISTs were larger in size and had more frequently invaded adjacent tissues than did the 53 mutation-negative GISTs. Histologically, the mutation-positive GISTs showed higher mitotic figures and more necrosis and hemorrhage. The patients with mutation-positive GISTs showed more frequent recurrences (P \u003d 0.0005) and higher mortality (P \u003d 0.0001) than did those with mutation-negative GISTs. The c-kit mutation was an independent prognostic factor for overall and cause-specific survival of the patients with GISTs. These results suggest that GISTs may be divided into mutation-positive and -negative subtypes. The prognosis was worse in patients with mutation-positive GISTs than in those with mutation-negative GISTs. Thus, mutation of the c-kit gene may be a good prognostic marker of GISTs.","title":"Effect of c-kit mutation on prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"10485475"}
