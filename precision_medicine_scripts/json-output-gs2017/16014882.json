The patients were stratified according to center, performance status, response to prior chemotherapy, number of prior regimens, and prior platinum-based therapy and were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib, at a dose of 150 mg daily, or placebo.\nThe median age of the 731 patients who underwent randomization was 61.4 years; 49 percent had received two prior chemotherapy regimens, and 93 percent had received platinum-based chemotherapy. The response rate was 8.9 percent in the erlotinib group and less than 1 percent in the placebo group (P\u003c0.001); the median duration of the response was 7.9 months and 3.7 months, respectively. Progression-free survival was 2.2 months and 1.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.61, adjusted for stratification categories; P\u003c0.001). Overall survival was 6.7 months and 4.7 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; P\u003c0.001), in favor of erlotinib. Five percent of patients discontinued erlotinib because of toxic effects.\nErlotinib can prolong survival in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer after first-line or second-line chemotherapy.","title":"Erlotinib in previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"16014882"}
