The 5-year overall survival is less than 5Â %. This very poor prognosis can be explained both by late diagnosis and by treatment resistance, including resistance to radiation therapy. A better understanding of the pancreatic tumorigenesis and knowledge of the most frequent mutations in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (KRAS, p16, TP53, Smad4) open new perspectives for the development of more effective treatments. This review presents the major genetic and molecular alterations in pancreatic cancer that could be targeted to improve radiosensitization.","title":"[New perspectives for radiosensitization in pancreatic carcinoma: a review of mechanisms involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis].","pubmedId":"21664851"}
