Recent research attempts show that only a small population of cancer patients responds to TKI and furthermore, these patients eventually develop resistance. Studies support the classification of resistance in primary and secondary resistance.\nIn the present study the differentiation between primary and secondary resistance to TKI in lung cancer cell lines was investigated. Lung cancer cell lines were tested for viability, apoptosis and cell cycle after exposure to the TKI erlotinib and gefitinib.\nCells with primary resistance showed similar cell-cycle patterns to those with secondary resistance but differences were observed between the two groups in the viability and apoptosis assays.\nUnderstanding the effects of TKI on cell signaling pathways would shed light on the mechanisms of acquired resistance and the differences between primary and secondary resistance.","title":"Primary and secondary resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24922647"}
