The patient was subsequently re-tested by next generation sequencing (NGS) and found to have ALK EIF2AK3-ALK fusion, and responded to crizotinib, but ultimately progressed and showed intolerance to this ALK inhibitor. She was then successfully treated with ceritinib 450 mg/day taken with food, has not suffered from any further gastrointestinal side-effects, and remains on ceritinib treatment after 12 months.\nSecond-line ceritinib treatment, when administered at 450 mg/day with food, is both well tolerated and efficacious in a patient with previously treated lung adenocarcinoma who had discontinued crizotinib due to disease progression and gastrointestinal adverse effects (AEs).","title":"Post-crizotinib management of effective ceritinib therapy in a patient with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"27480287"}
