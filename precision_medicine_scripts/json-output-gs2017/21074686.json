The t(11;19) translocation and its CRTC1/MAML1 fusion transcript have been identified in MEC at different sites and are believed to be associated with the development of a subset of these tumors. However, the status of the fusion transcript has not been reported in intraosseous MEC. Here, we report 3 examples of central MEC of the mandible, including a case with a history of primary retromolar MEC. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing analyses of the microdissected components of these tumors were used for the detection and verification of the fusion transcript. We identified, for the first time, the t(11;19) fusion gene transcript in central MEC, including in the previous primary retromolar MEC. No fusion transcript was detected in the second primary noncentral MEC or in another central MEC. The results indicate that central MEC can manifest the fusion transcript. This finding may have diagnostic and histogenetic roles in the future analysis of this entity.","title":"CRTC1/MAML2 fusion transcript in central mucoepidermoid carcinoma of mandible--diagnostic and histogenetic implications.","pubmedId":"21074686"}
