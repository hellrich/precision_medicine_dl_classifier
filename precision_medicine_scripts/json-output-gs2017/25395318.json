Importantly, while BRCA2 mutation carriers generally have a lower cumulative risk for ovarian cancer, mutations clustered in the central portion of BRCA2 are associated with a higher proportion of ovarian compared with breast cancer cases. The boundaries of this ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR) have been tentatively defined within a 3.3 kb region of BRCA2 exon 11, and herein, we reassessed these boundaries using our series of Italian breast/ovarian cancer families. We used direct sequencing to investigate BRCA mutations in 367 breast/ovarian cancer families. We also studied the association between the location of the mutations and the ovarian cancer phenotype in our cohort of BRCA2-mutated families. We observed the novel c.7309_7309delA frameshift mutation and the c.7007G\u003eA deleterious mutation in BRCA2 exons 14 and 13, respectively, in five independent Italian families characterized by a high proportion of ovarian cancer cases. Of note, a significantly higher proportion of ovarian versus breast cancer cases was associated not only with mutations in the previously defined OCCR (OR \u003d 5.91; p \u003d 0.004), but also with the exon 13-14 region (OR \u003d 7.37; p \u003d 0.001) in our BRCA2-mutated families. Our data provide initial evidence for a novel putative OCCR in BRCA2 exons 13-14.
