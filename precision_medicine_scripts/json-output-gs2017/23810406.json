While traditional management of Type 2 diabetes has focused mainly on glycemic control, robust evidence supports the integration of hypertension and dyslipidemia management to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The primary objective of this study was to assess the level of control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipids (3Bs) among patients with type 2 diabetes. An additional objective was to investigate the impact of hospital type, physician specialty, treatment pattern, and patient profile on clinical outcomes.\nThis was a cross-sectional, multicenter observational study. A nationally representative sample of outpatients with established type 2 diabetes were enrolled at hospitals representative of geographic regions, tiers, and physician specialties in China. Main clinical measurements were the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, and total serum cholesterol in reference to target goals.\nA total of 25,817 adults with type 2 diabetes (mean age 62.6 years, 47% male) were enrolled at 104 hospitals. Seventy-two percent reported comorbid hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both. Patients with concurrent type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were 6 times more likely to report a prior history of cardiovascular disease compared with those with type 2 diabetes alone. The mean HbA1c level was 7.6%. While 47.7%, 28.4%, and 36.1% of patients achieved the individual target goals for control of blood glucose (HbA1c \u003c7%), blood pressure (systolic blood pressure \u003c130 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure \u003c80Â mm Hg), and blood lipids (total cholesterol \u003c4.5 mmol/L), respectively, only 5.6% achieved all 3 target goals. Lower body mass index (\u003c24 kg/m(2)), no active smoking or drinking, higher education, and diabetes duration \u003c5 years were independent predictors of better cardiovascular disease risk control.\nAchieving adequate control of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes remains a clinical challenge. Interventions to achieve control of 3Bs coupled with modification of additional cardiovascular disease predictors are crucial for optimization of clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.","title":"Primacy of the 3B approach to control risk factors for cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes patients.","pubmedId":"23810406"}
