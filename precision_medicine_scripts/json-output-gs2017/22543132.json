The sequence of STK11 gene coding region was analyzed using PCR and DNA sequencing and compared with the normal sequence of STK11 gene.\nOf the 20 patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, 14 showed STK11 gene mutations in the coding region, including 1 patient having two mutations and 13 patients with a single mutation site. In one case, sequence analysis of the STK11 gene identified a novel type of STK11 germline mutation, in which the cytosine (C)460 was substituted by guanine (G) in exon 3 to result in a new amino acid at codon 154. Four patients from 2 families were found to have a common mutation. The remaining 6 patients were not found to have mutations in STK11 gene coding region.\nMutations of STK11 gene is a major cause of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The missense mutation of 460 C→G in exon 3 of STK11 gene is a novel mutation associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","title":"[Mutation analysis of STK11 gene coding region for 20 Chinese patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome].","pubmedId":"22543132"}
