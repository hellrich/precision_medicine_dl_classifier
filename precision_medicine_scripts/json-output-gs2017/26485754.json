Therefore, exploring the regulatory mechanism in Wnt/β-catenin signaling may provide valuable clinical targets for cancer therapy. In the current study, we demonstrated that upregulation of miR-744 in pancreatic cancer promoted Wnt/β-catenin signaling by directly targeting secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and transducin-like enhancer of split 3 (TLE3), important negative modulators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Expression of miR-744 was markedly upregulated in pancreatic cancer and positively correlated with poor patient survival. Furthermore, we found that overexpressing miR-744 enhanced, while inhibiting miR-744 reduced, the stem cell-like phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Importantly, in vivo model of human-derived pancreatic xenografts showed that miR-744 upregulation enhanced the tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer cells. These findings suggest that miR-744 plays a vital role in promoting the stem cell-like phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells, and may represent a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.
