However, many patients develop imatinib resistance due to secondary KIT mutations. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) protects KIT oncoproteins from proteasome-mediated degradation, and we therefore did preclinical validations of the HSP90 inhibitor, 17-allylamino-18-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG), in an imatinib-sensitive GIST cell line (GIST882) and in novel imatinib-resistant GIST lines that are either dependent on (GIST430 and GIST48) or independent of (GIST62) KIT oncoproteins. 17AAG (\u003e100 nmol/L) inhibited imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant KIT oncoproteins, with substantially reduced phospho-KIT and total KIT expression after 30 minutes and 6 hours, respectively. KIT signaling intermediates, including AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase, were inactivated by 17-AAG in the KIT-positive GIST lines, but not in the KIT-negative GIST62. Likewise, cell proliferation and survival were inhibited in the KIT-positive GISTs but not in GIST62. These findings suggest that 17-AAG biological effects in KIT-positive GISTs result mainly from KIT oncoprotein inhibition. The dramatic inactivation of imatinib-resistant KIT oncoproteins suggests that HSP90 inhibition provides a therapeutic solution to the challenge of heterogeneous imatinib resistance mutations in GIST patients.","title":"Heat shock protein 90 inhibition in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","pubmedId":"16982758"}
