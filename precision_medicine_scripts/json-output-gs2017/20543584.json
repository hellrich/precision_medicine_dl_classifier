Active immunity against bFGF could be a promising approach for the biotherapy of cancer. Because bFGF is abundant in normal and malignant tissues, it is presumably difficult for normal bFGF to induce immunity due to self-tolerance. In addition, previous studies have shown that a complex consisting of a cationic liposome and a non-coding plasmid DNA can be used to stimulate innate immunity. This stimulation initiates a potent cytokine response, which can inhibit tumor growth. To investigate the effects of immunity against bFGF on murine colon carcinomas, we employed an N-, C-terminally truncated basic fibroblast growth factor (tbFGF, of human origin) as an antigen and a liposome-DNA complex as an adjuvant. After six immunizations, a robust bFGF-specific immune response was elicited. Subsequently, inhibition of tumor growth and a significant reduction in tumor vasculature were observed. The antitumor effect was confirmed by adoptive therapy of activated spleen cells from the immunized mice. In vitro, a CTL assay revealed that bFGF-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) resulted in the lysis of mouse microvascular endothelial cells (MS1) rather than that of the CT26 colorectal cancer cells. These results suggest that anti-angiogenesis treatment induced by a bFGF-specific CTLs against microvascular endothelial cells may be a useful method for cancer therapy.","title":"An N-, C-terminally truncated basic fibroblast growth factor and LPD (liposome-polycation-DNA) complexes elicits a protective immune response against murine colon carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20543584"}
