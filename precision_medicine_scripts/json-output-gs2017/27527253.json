In case of persistent clinical symptoms despite discontinuation of chemotherapy, cytomegalovirus colitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chemotherapy-induced enterocolitis. We herein report the case of a patient who underwent surgery for lung adenocarcinoma followed by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with uracil-tegafur and was diagnosed as having cytomegalovirus colitis during the therapy. In the course of chemotherapy, cytomegalovirus colitis occasionally occurs even though the patient does not experience severe myelosuppression; thus, it is necessary that we recognize its potential occurrence.","title":"Cytomegalovirus colitis in a patient undergoing postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma with uracil-tegafur.","pubmedId":"27527253"}
