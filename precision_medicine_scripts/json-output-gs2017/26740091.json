Medulloblastoma is well described in this cohort but reports of other brain tumours are uncommon. The molecular profile of tumours from FA patients is not well reported. A glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from a 3-year-old patient with FA and confirmed biallelic BRCA2 mutations was submitted for methylation analysis. This revealed strong clustering with the K27 mutation subgroup and copy number analysis showed gains of chromosomes 1q, 4q, part of 7q, part of 8q and 17q with resultant amplifications of MDM4, CDK6, MET, MYC and PPM1D (WIP1). We also describe for the first time the germline mutation in BRCA2 c.8057T \u003e C resulting in p.Leu2686Pro in our patient with confirmed FA. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations have predisposed to an aggressive and universally fatal subtype of childhood GBM in our patient. Copy number alterations and multiple oncogenic amplifications may be secondary to inherent chromosomal instability and this raises the question of what role BRCA2 may play in the development of GBM in children without FA.","title":"Biallelic FANCD1/BRCA2 mutations predisposing to glioblastoma multiforme with multiple oncogenic amplifications.","pubmedId":"26740091"}
