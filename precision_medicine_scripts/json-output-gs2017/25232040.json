Afatinib is also active in patients progressing on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). We report the results of a large cohort of NSCLC patients receiving afatinib within a compassionate-use program (CUP).\nPatients with advanced NSCLC progressing after one line or more of chemotherapy and one line or more of EGFR-TKI treatment with either an EGFR mutation or documented clinical benefit were enrolled. Data collection was not monitored or verified by central review. The intention of this CUP was to provide controlled preregistration access to afatinib for patients with life-threatening diseases and no other treatment option.\nFrom May 2010 to October 2013, 573 patients (65% female; median age: 64 years [range: 28-89 years]) were enrolled, with strong participation of community oncologists. Comorbidities were allowed, including second malignancies in 11% of patients. EGFR mutation status was available in 391 patients (72%), and 83% tested mutation positive. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) of 541 patients treated with afatinib was 3.7 months (range: 0.0 to \u003e29.0 months). Median TTF was 4.0 and 2.7 months in patients with adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, respectively, and 4.6 months in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Adverse events were generally manageable.\nAfatinib was able to be given in a real-world setting to heavily pretreated patients with EGFR-mutated or EGFR-TKI-sensitive NSCLC. Acknowledging the constraints of data collection in a CUP, afatinib appears to be safe and to confer some clinical benefit in this population.","title":"Experience with afatinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer progressing after clinical benefit from gefitinib and erlotinib.","pubmedId":"25232040"}
