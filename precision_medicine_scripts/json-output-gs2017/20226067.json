BSEP disease is associated with an increased risk of hepatobiliary cancer.\nA 36 year old woman with BSEP disease developed pancreatic adenocarcinoma at age 36. She had been treated with a biliary diversion at age 18. A 1.7 x 1.3 cm mass was detected in the pancreas on abdominal CT scan. A 2 cm mass lesion was found at the neck and proximal body of the pancreas. Pathology demonstrated a grade 2-3 adenocarcinoma with invasion into the peripancreatic fat.\nClinicians should be aware of the possibility of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in patients with BSEP disease.","title":"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma in type 2 progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis.","pubmedId":"20226067"}
