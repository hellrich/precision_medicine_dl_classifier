Here we report final overall survival data from JO22903.\nJO22903 (JapicCTI-101085) was a single-arm, multicenter, phase II, open-label, non-randomized study of first-line erlotinib monotherapy in EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Eligible patients (≥20 years) with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer and confirmed activating mutations of EGFR (exon 19 deletion or L858R point mutation in exon 21) received oral erlotinib 150 mg/day until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival and safety; overall survival was a secondary endpoint.\nAt the final analysis, 102 patients were included in the modified intent-to-treat population and 103 in the safety population. Median follow-up was 32.3 months. Median overall survival was 36.3 months (95 % confidence interval 29.4-not reached). Subgroup analyses of overall survival suggested that the presence of brain metastases was a negative prognostic factor (median overall survival 22.7 months, 95 % confidence interval 19.6-29.4). The impact on overall survival of using versus not using EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in any line of treatment following disease progression was unclear (median 32.8 versus 36.3 months, respectively). No new safety issues were observed.\nIn this survival update, single-agent erlotinib achieved a median overall survival of more than 3 years in patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.","title":"Final overall survival in JO22903, a phase II, open-label study of first-line erlotinib for Japanese patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"27659294"}
