Recently, G12C KRAS mutation in isogenic NSCLC cell line has been shown to be a key player in promoting metabolic rewiring mainly through the regulation of glutamine metabolism to fuel growth and proliferation. Even though cell lines possessing many of the genetic backgrounds of the primary cancer they derive from could be a valuable pre-clinical model, they do not have the additional complexity present in the whole tumor that impact metabolism. This preliminary study is aimed to explore how cancer cell metabolism in culture might recapitulate the metabolic alterations present in vivo. Our result highlighted that the gross metabolic changes observed in G12C KRAS mutant cells growing in culture were also maintained in the derived xenograft model, suggesting that a simple in vitro cell model can give important insights into the metabolic alterations induced by cancer. This is of relevance for guiding effective targeting of those metabolic traits that underlie tumor progression and anticancer treatment responses.
