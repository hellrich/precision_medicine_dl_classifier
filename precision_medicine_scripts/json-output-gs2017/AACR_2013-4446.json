However, acquired resistance to these agents has already been described in treated patients, and the mechanisms of such resistance remain largely unknown.Experimental Design: We established lines of EML4-ALK-positive H3122 lung cancer cells that are resistant to the ALK inhibitor TAE684 (H3122/TR cells) and investigated their resistance mechanism with the use of immunoblot analysis, ELISA, reverse transcription and real-time PCR analysis, and an annexin V binding assay. We isolated EML4-ALK-positive lung cancer cells (K-3) from a patient who developed resistance to crizotinib and investigated their characteristic.Results: The expression of EML4-ALK was reduced at the transcriptional level, whereas phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, and HER3 was up-regulated, in H3122/TR cells compared with those in H3122 cells. This activation of HER family proteins was accompanied by increased secretion of EGF. Treatment with an EGFR-TKI induced apoptosis in H3122/TR cells, but not in H3122 cells. The TAE684-induced inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and STAT3 phosphorylation observed in parental cells was prevented by exposure of these cells to exogenous EGF, resulting in a reduced sensitivity of cell growth to TAE684. K-3 cells also manifested HER family activation accompanied by increased EGF secretion.Conclusions: EGF-mediated activation of HER family signaling is associated with ALK-TKI resistance in lung cancer positive for EML4-ALK.","title":"Activation of HER Family signaling as a mechanism of acquired resistance to ALK Inhibitors in EML4-ALK-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-4446"}
