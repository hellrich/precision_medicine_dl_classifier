Of them, 20 were given simultaneous cyclophosphamide (CTX) and 14 had received mediastinal irradiation. 40 mg/m2 of ADM was given by rapid IV bolus injection which was repeated every 3 weeks. All but 9 had normal electrocardiogram (ECG) before ADM administration. In these 9 patients, when ADM reached certain accumulated dose, ECG showed no further changes. Thirty-seven (24.5%) cases had various types of abnormal ECG, manifested as arrhythmia in 11, non-specific ST-T changes in 12 and low voltage in 14. Of these 37 patients, fatal congestive heart failure developed in 4 cases. To reduce ADM cardiotoxicity, its indication should be strictly adhered to; ADM may be divided to two fractions on Day 1 and 2, for those patients receiving simultaneous CTX or who had had mediastinal irradiation, ADM accumulated dose should be limited to 400 mg/m2; ADM should never be given to patients with lowered QRS voltage greater than or equal to 30% of the normal value or with obvious ST-T changes; the accumulated doses should range from 450 to 550 mg/m2, simultaneous anti-histamines, anti-adrenaline, coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E are indicated.","title":"[Electrocardiogram analysis of adriamycin cardiotoxicity in 160 cases].","pubmedId":"1889343"}
