The computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a right ovarian mass with anterior abdominal wall metastasis. The CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the ovarian mass showed adenocarcinoma. FNAC from the umbilical and skin metastasis also showed adenocarcinoma. Because of the unresectability of the mass, the patient was put on taxol-based chemotherapy, which she took for two cycles, and then died of progressive disease after three months.","title":"Ovarian adenocarcinoma in a young female with skin and umbilical metastasis.","pubmedId":"20838558"}
