Human PDACs overexpress a number of angiogenic factors and their cognate high-affinity receptors, and anti-angiogenic agents reduce tumor volume, metastasis, and microvessel density (MVD), and improve survival in subcutaneous and orthotopic pre-clinical models. Nonetheless, clinical trials using anti-angiogenic therapy have been overwhelmingly unsuccessful. This review will focus on these pre-clinical and clinical studies, the potential reasons for failure in the clinical setting, and ways these shortcomings could be addressed in future investigations of angiogenic mechanisms in PDAC.
