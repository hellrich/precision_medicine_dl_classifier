After 48 d inflammation were observed two groups of rat paw swelling degree (E) and the arthritis index (AI), HE staining of lung tissue pathological changes in the calculation factor of two groups of rat lung (LI), alveolitis points, the immune staining detection of Foxp3, TGF-β1 protein expression. Through the small animal lung function detected by lung function, ELISA determination of cytokine changes in the expression of Treg by flow cytometry.\nCompared with the NC group, Model rats E, AI, LI, 1 seconds, average expiratory flow (FEV1/FVC%), pulmonary inflammation score, serum TNF-α, Th1/Th2, lung tissue TGF-β1, CD4(+);CD25(-);T cells, the expression level was significantly higher, and the difference was statistically significant (P\u003c0.05 or P\u003c0.01); forced vital capacity (FVC), 25% lung capacity, peak expiratory flow (FEF25), 50% vital capacity of the peak expiratory flow (FEF50), 75% lung capacity, peak expiratory flow (FEF75), maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMF), forced maximal expiratory flow (PEF), pulmonary dynamic compliance (Cldyn), serum IL-10, CD4(+);Treg, CD4(+);CD25(+);Treg, lung tissue levels of Foxp3 protein expression significantly decreased(P\u003c0.01). Spearman correlation analysis showed that, AA rats with pulmonary function parameters are E, AI, TNF-α, IL-10, Th1/Th2, and CD4(+);Treg, CD4(+);CD25(+);Treg, CD4(+);CD25(-);T cells, Foxp3, TGF-β1 expression was relevant, and relevant statistical significance (P\u003c0.05 or P\u003c0.01).\nAfter induced inflammation, antigen stimulation showed hypersensitivity reaction condition in rats, Th1/Th2 imbalance in the state, CD4(+);CD25(-);T cells into CD4(+);CD25(+);Treg blocked, the immune regulatory function of disorders, the release of a large number of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, leading to Local joint disease and lung tissue damage, which occurred AA reduced lung function.","title":"[The correlative study on pulmonary function changes and Th1/Th2 cells \u0026 regulatory T cells in adjuvant arthritis rats].","pubmedId":"21208566"}
