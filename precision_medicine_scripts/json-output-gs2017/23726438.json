This study aimed to investigate the association between family history of cancer and EGFR mutation status in NSCLC population.\nFrom February 2008 to May 2012, 538 consecutive NSCLC patients with known EGFR mutation status were included into this study. Amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) method was used to detect EGFR mutation. The associations between EGFR mutation and family history of cancer were evaluated using logistic regression models.\nEGFR activating mutation was found in 220 patients and 117 patients had family cancer histories among first-degree relatives. EGFR mutation was more frequently detected in adenocarcinoma patients (p \u003c 0.001), never-smoker (p \u003c 0.001) and with family history of cancer (p \u003d 0.031), especially who had family history of lung cancer (p \u003d 0.008). In multivariate analysis, the association of EGFR mutation with family history of cancer also existed (p \u003d 0.027).\nNSCLC patients with family history of cancer, especially family history of lung cancer, might have a significantly higher incidence of EGFR activating mutation.","title":"Impact of family history of cancer on the incidence of mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor gene in non-small cell lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"23726438"}
