To settle down the conflict, this metaanalysis is prepared to clarify the present prognostic role of BRAF V600E mutation in patients with PTC.\nThe relevant published researches were incorporated according to the defined inclusion/exclusion criteria from PubMed. The effect sizes of outcome parameters were estimated by hazard ratios (HRs).\nThe current meta-analysis included 19 researches with a total of 6087 patients. We have found that patients with BRAF V600E mutation have a poor overall survival (the pooled HR\u003d2.91, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-6.29). Furthermore, subgroup analysis of the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of PTC patients by races indicated that BRAF V600E mutation predicts poor RFS of patients (the pooled HR\u003d1.63, 95% CI: 1.37-1.93), both Caucasian (the pooled HR\u003d1.57, 95% CI: 1.30-1.90) and Asian (the pooled HR\u003d1.91, 95% CI: 1.28-2.87).\nThe poor prognosis predicted role of BRAF V600E mutation in PTC was certified from the current meta-analysis. The BRAF V600E mutation may be used as a prognostic predictor of patients with PTC.","title":"The BRAF V600E mutation predicts poor survival outcome in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma: a meta analysis.","pubmedId":"26885200"}
