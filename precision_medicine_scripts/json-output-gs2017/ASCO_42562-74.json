Recently, it was shown that this fibrotic reaction limits the delivery and efficacy of chemotherapy, thereby limiting the progress made in the treatment of this cancer. To identify potential therapeutic targets to overcome the desmoplastic reaction, we examined the interplay between fibrosis and a key proteinase required for growth and invasion in the collagen-rich microenvironment. Previously we had published that the proteinase membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and can be induced by the collagen-rich fibrosis. Methods: To further examine the contribution of MT1-MMP to pancreatic cancer progression in the in vivo microenvironment, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing MT1-MMP and mutant Kras in the pancreas. The mice were sacrificed, and their pancreata were permanently fixed and then analyzed for the presence of precancerous lesions. Results: Relative to control Kras+-only mice, Kras+/MT1-MMP+ mice demonstrated a more pronounced phenotype. The Kras+/MT1-MMP+ mice exhibited significant increases in the frequency and size of precancerous lesions, with more fibrosis both around each lesion and throughout the gland when compared to control mice. The bigenic mice also demonstrated significantly more acinar to ductal metaplasia and showed evidence of invasion into the stroma. Conclusions: Given that MT1-MMP functions to promote the desmoplastic reaction and is overexpressed in human PDAC tumors, targeting MT1-MMPprovides a new treatment strategy to address the significant challenge of delivering therapeutic agents through the desmoplastic reaction in pancreatic cancer.","title":"Role of MT1-MMP and Kras in invasive pancreatic tumors with pronounced fibrosis.","pubmedId":"ASCO_42562-74"}
