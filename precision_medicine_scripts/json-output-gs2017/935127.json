One centre (Frankfurt) had nine priapisms in 96 patients, whereas the other centre (Montpellier) had none in 59 patients. The only difference found were higher haematocrits in Frankfurt than in Montpellier. The highest haematocrits were found in the priapism patients. Further evaluation of the Frankfurt data showed that androgen therapy, high haematocrits and hypovolemia increase the risk of dialysis priapism. It is recommended to withdraw androgen therapy when the haematocrit is consistantly above 25%.","title":"Factors predisposing to priapism in haemodialysis patients.","pubmedId":"935127"}
