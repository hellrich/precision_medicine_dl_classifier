Additionally, approximately 70% of Braf(V600E) mice develop melanomas that reproduce many of the cardinal histological and molecular features of human melanoma and whose cells can colonize the lungs of nude mice. We show that the tumor suppressor p16(INK4a) is not required to induce melanocyte senescence and that its loss is not required for tumor progression, although it does regulate tumor penetrance and latency. Thus, we have developed a mouse model of melanoma driven by Braf(V600E) expressed at physiological levels that reflects the genetics and pathology of the human disease.","title":"Oncogenic Braf induces melanocyte senescence and melanoma in mice.","pubmedId":"19345328"}
