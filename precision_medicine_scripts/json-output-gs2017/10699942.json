The prognostic significance of this association is unknown. Two cohorts of patients with a first diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancer and a subsequent diagnosis of either NHL (n \u003d 170) or colon cancer (n \u003d 435) were established using national cancer registry data in Denmark. Two other cohorts of patients in whom NHL (n \u003d 600) or colon cancer (n \u003d 1,541) was the patients\u0027 first known malignancy served as comparison groups. Mortality rates were compared using Cox\u0027s regression analysis. Among patients younger than 80 years at NHL diagnosis, a history of non-melanoma skin cancer was associated with significantly increased mortality [relative risk (RR) \u003d 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.99]. This association was present in both men (RR \u003d 1.38; 1.02-1.86) and women (RR \u003d 2.15; 1.31-3.54) and was similar after both major subtypes of non-melanoma skin cancer. Overall, antedating non-melanoma skin cancer had no prognostic significance for colon cancer patients (RR \u003d 1.00; 0.84-1.18). Whatever the underlying mechanism, our observation has potential clinical implications. If substantiated in other settings, NHL patients with prior non-melanoma skin cancer may constitute a subgroup of lymphoma patients in need of particular therapeutic attention.","title":"Non-melanoma skin cancer may be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma.","pubmedId":"10699942"}
