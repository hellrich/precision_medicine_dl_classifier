It is frequently used with curative intent as a single treatment modality or, more frequently, combined with chemotherapy and/or surgery. Radiotherapy also provides effective palliation of symptoms caused by locally advanced or metastatic disease. In this article, we review the role of radiation in the treatment of lung, colon and prostate cancer. We also discuss ongoing clinical trials and a unique cancer disparity program, \"Walking Forward\", that investigates methods of improving access to cancer care, with the ultimate goal of improving cancer cure rates.","title":"The role of radiation therapy in the management of lung, prostate and colorectal cancer in South Dakota.","pubmedId":"20397493"}
