This unusual localization with atypical clinical and histological appearance may induce diagnostic and treatment delay. We report the 13th case shown in the literature in a 31-year-old woman initially treated for a vulvar lipoma. Arguments based on clinical short term recurrence, histological infiltrating adipocytes, and cytogenentical findings evoked well-differentiated liposarcoma. Even though cytogenetic abnormalities, involving MDM2 and CDK4 genes, have been found, a certainty in malignity diagnosis could be difficult. In these cases, treatment decision may be uneasy. This case report recalls difficulties encountered in uterine hypercellular leiomyomas.","title":"[Atypical lipomatous tumour of the vulva. About one case].","pubmedId":"14736600"}
