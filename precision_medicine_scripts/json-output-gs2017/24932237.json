To determine the risk factors of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, two polymorphisms, solute carrier family 23 member 2 (SLC23A2-05 [rs4987219]) and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-LCS6 (rs61764370), and environmental factors, including smoking and alcohol consumption, were studied in a population. The present study included 165 males diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The control group consisted of 230 healthy male subjects without cancer or a family history of cancer. The SLC23A2-05 and KRAS-LCS6 polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction followed by enzymatic digestion. All patients and healthy subjects were assessed with regard to their smoking habit and alcohol consumption as these are considered to be risk factors for cancer. The statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression, Fisher\u0027s exact and Ï‡2 tests. Additional analyses were performed using the programs, multi-factor dimensionality reduction (MDR; version 2.0) and MDR permutation test (version 0.4.7), which consider all variables as risk factors simultaneously. The results of the present study demonstrate that the SLC23A2-05 and KRAS-LCS6 polymorphisms are not a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In the same samples, the association of alcohol consumption (P\u003c0.001) and smoking habit (P\u003c0.001) with cancer presence was positive when each variable was considered individually. Concerning the environmental factors, a positive association of smoking habit and alcohol consumption with cancer, although not with ethnicity (ratio, 1.0244; testing balance accuracy, 0.8733; P\u003c0.001) was identified using the MDR tool, which analyzed the variables and polymorphism genotypes simultaneously. In conclusion, in the present study, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck was highly affected by environmental factors when compared with the affect of SLC23A2-05 and KRAS-LCS6 polymorphisms.","title":"SLC23A2-05 (rs4987219) and KRAS-LCS6 (rs61764370) polymorphisms in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","pubmedId":"24932237"}
