While surgical, radiotherapeutic and systemic therapy of primary breast cancer are performed according to widely accepted guidelines, the management of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) is still a matter of individualised concepts because of the lack of randomised studies. IBTR represents a significant medical problem, since the recurrence rate is 5-15 % after 5 years and 20-25 % after 10 years. Incidence is higher in younger patients, in tumors with an extensive intraductal component, positive tumor margins, axillary lymph node metastases, negative steroid hormone receptors and high proliferative activity. Distant metastases after IBTR occur more often if the interval between primary diagnosis and IBTR is short (e. g. less than 4 years). Diagnosis of IBTR include breast palpation, mammography and breast ultrasound. In addition breast MRI can be used to further differentiate between benign and malignant lesions after breast conservation. Standard therapy in this setting remains mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery may be considered in the context of clinical trials for patients with certain favorable features. Breast irradiation after secondary breast-conservation can be carried out in some cases. Some local relapses after breast-conserving surgery have a poorer prognosis, and the addition of adjuvant systemic therapy should be considered in addition to mastectomy. The heterogeneous nature of locoregional relapses has made it difficult to conduct prospective randomized clinical trials. However, many retrospective data exist, making it possible to recommend rational treatment approaches for these patients.","title":"[Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after conservative breast cancer surgery -- diagnosis and therapy].","pubmedId":"15389375"}
