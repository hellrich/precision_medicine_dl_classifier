Given that data suggest limited benefit from second line therapy and the challenges associated with a rapid decline in performance status, it is reasonable to evaluate how many patients receive disease-directed therapy after first line failure. This observational analysis of UPMC CancerCenter (UPMC) data captured in the Via Portal (VP) examines the trajectory of care for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Methods: UPMC providers utilize Via Pathways decision support algorithms in their daily practice through the web-based VP. We analyzed all new treatment starts for metastatic pancreatic patients captured in the VP from Jul 2009 to Dec 2014. Patients on therapy at the time of this analysis were excluded in entirety. Days on treatment was defined as time elapsed between patient visits in the VP, not actual treatment start/stop dates. Off treatment decisions (selected from a list) were reported for the last treatment received. We assumed patients were no longer on active treatment if 4 weeks elapsed without a visit. Off treatment decisions were not reported for these patients. Results: A total of 782 new treatment starts were captured. Of those, 534 had off treatment decisions captured for the following: End of Life Care (57%), Observation (18%), Referral to Other Provider (11%), Other Reason (6%), Poor PS (4%), Second Opinion (2%), Patient Refused (2%). Conclusions: The majority of patients did not receive second line therapy and only 13.4% went on to third line. The median number of days on treatment was consistent for the first three therapies received. End of Life Care was chosen most frequently when stopping therapy. Ongoing work includes promoting early incorporation of palliative and/or end of life care into the pathways. Additionally, more active chemotherapy combinations that became the standard of care near the end of the evaluated period may enable more patients to receive multiple lines of therapy. These data are being actively evaluated and will be updated at the time of the presentation.
