Biopsies were diagnostic of carcinoma in 12 (70.5%). Among 11 exophytic tumours biopsy was positive in 8 (72.7%) while in 6 tumours growing inside the papilla biopsies were positive in 4 (66.6%) (NS). It is concluded that endoscopic biopsy may be diagnostic in two-thirds of ampullary carcinomas.","title":"[The value of endoscopic biopsy in the diagnosis of carcinoma of Vater\u0027s ampulla].","pubmedId":"2043401"}
