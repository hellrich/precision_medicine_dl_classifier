In the palliative scenario, the combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin is widely used. Carboplatin is also an active agent in cervical cancer, and its association with paclitaxel could represent a well-tolerated, less toxic, and effective therapeutic option. The objective of this study was to evaluate response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity of carboplatin and paclitaxel in first palliative line for cervical cancer.\nA retrospective search of database at Brazilian National Cancer Institute was performed, and all patients with persistent/recurrent and advanced cervical cancer treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin in first palliative line, between August 2008 and January 2010, were included.\nA total of 153 women were enrolled. Objective responses were documented in 34.6% (5.2% of complete responses and 29.4% of partial responses). With a median follow-up of 27.8 months, the median progression-free survival was 5.2 months, and the median overall survival was 10.63 months. The most common toxicity was myelosuppression: grades 3 and 4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia observed in 43.0%, 17.8%, and 9.2% of the cases, respectively. Neurotoxicity was presented by 30.7% of the patients. Renal toxicity was detected in 21.9% of the patients, but only 4.0% were grade 3, and none were grade 4.\nThis retrospective study has demonstrated that paclitaxel-carboplatin is an active and well-tolerated regimen for the treatment of advanced cervical cancer.","title":"First-line paclitaxel and carboplatin in persistent/recurrent or advanced cervical cancer: a retrospective analysis of patients treated at Brazilian National Cancer Institute.","pubmedId":"23552805"}
