Mutations in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of EGFR were analyzed by Scorpion amplification refractory mutation system (Scorpions ARMS).\nIn a cohort of 53 lung adenocarcinomas, ALK gene rearrangements were identified in 6 tumors (11.3%), including 4 male and 2 female patients. Five were acinar predominant adenocarcinomas and one was mucinous adenocarcinoma (P\u003d1.000). All tumors with the ALK rearrangements had the wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene (P\u003d0.023). The median time of disease-free survival (DFS) in ALK positive patients and negative patients were 14 months (95%CI 8.0-20.0) and 31 months (95%CI 24.9-37.1), respectively and the difference was significant (Log-rank test, P\u003d0.019). ALK gene rearrangements were significantly associated with early recurrence, but not tumor size, pathologic stages, histological differentiation and lymph node metastasis.\nALK gene rearrangements are present at a higher frequency in lung adenocarcinomas of the Chinese patients. ALK gene rearrangements are mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations and associated with early tumor recurrence.","title":"[Clinicopathologic correlation and ALK rearrangement in adenocarcinoma of lung].","pubmedId":"24915814"}
