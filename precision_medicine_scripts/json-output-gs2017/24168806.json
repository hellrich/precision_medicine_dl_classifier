The gastrointestinal stromal tumor universally expresses KIT and DOG-1 and frequently harbors oncogenic mutations in the KIT gene. While the gastrointestinal stromal tumor usually arises in the alimentary tract, it is rarely found in the extragastrointestinal area. When it is, it is called an extragastrointestinal stromal tumor. Although the pathogenesis, prognostic factors and outcomes of gastrointestinal stromal tumors are well known, those of extragastrointestinal stromal tumors have not been fully studied. We report, herein, a unique primary extragastrointestinal stromal tumor from the pleura in a 73-year-old woman who presented with pleural mass. The extragastrointestinal stromal tumor was surgically resected and confirmed by means of an immunohistochemical study and a molecular analysis.
