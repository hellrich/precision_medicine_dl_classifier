The tumour was characterized by a lack of glandular differentiation, tetraploidy, a rapid mitotic index and a high rate of glycolysis. The adenocarcinoma was readily maintained in tissue culture and could be passaged through the host by inoculating either cell suspensions or tissue explants. In the rat, tumour growth resulted in a loss of adipose tissue at a tumour mass of less than 5% body weight indicating that increased energy expenditure was already present at that stage. In addition the tumour caused anaemia, hypercalcaemia and hypoglycaemia. Hyperketonaemia was also observed in fasted tumour-bearing rats. Methotrexate arrested tumour growth in vivo. These aspects of the tumour model make it useful for investigations into host-tumour competition and mechanisms of cachexia.","title":"Biochemical manifestations of a rat mammary adenocarcinoma-producing cachexia: in vivo and in vitro studies.","pubmedId":"2228029"}
