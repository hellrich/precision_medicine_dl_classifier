Long-term overall survival (OS) of these patients is largely unknown. BRCA1/2 mutations are associated with DNA double strand break repair deficiency and more data are needed to establish whether PDAC patients with a BRCA1/2 germline mutation achieve better OS with DNA cross linking agents such as platinum. Methods: The objective was to evaluate OS including survival outcomes achieved with platinum based chemotherapy in a cohort of BRCA1/2germline mutant PDAC patients. Primary endpoint was 5 year OS for patients with stage I \u0026 II operable disease and 2 year OS for patients with inoperable stage III \u0026 IV advanced disease. Evaluable patients, diagnosed between January 1997 and December 2015, were identified from the Ontario Pancreas Cancer Study prospective database. Results: Fifty seven patients, 25 female and 32 male, were identified: 14 BRCA1 mutant, 42 BRCA2 mutant, and 1 double mutant. Median age was 63 years (range 29-84). Twenty six patients (45%) had prior cancer diagnoses (13 breast, 3 prostate, 3 bladder, 2 ovarian, 2 thyroid, 1 colon, 1 melanoma and 1 lymphoma). At a median follow up of 18 months (range 2-87), 40 (70%) have died. Twenty four (42%) had a primary tumor resection (4 stage I + 20 stage II). Their median OS was 19.5 months and 5 year OS 17% (95%CI 6-35%). Thirty three patients (58%) had advanced disease (8 inoperable stage III + 25 stage IV). Their median OS was 9.6 months and 2 year OS 24% (95%CI 11.5-43%). Twenty advanced patients received platinum (oxaliplatin, cisplatin or carboplatin) either as part of first line or subsequent lines of palliative chemotherapy. Their median OS was 15.3 months and 2 year OS 35% (95%CI 18-56%). Of remaining 13 advanced patients, treatment details were not available for one. For 12 advanced patients who did not receive platinum chemotherapy, median OS was 8.3 months and 2 year OS 0%. Conclusions: In this large cohort of germline BRCA1/2 mutant PDAC patients, OS for early stage disease was similar to historical controls, whereas OS for advanced disease was superior to historical controls, particularly for patients who received platinum based chemotherapy.","title":"Overall survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation.","pubmedId":"ASCO_169856-176"}
