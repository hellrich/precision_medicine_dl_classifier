Those molecular targeted strategies are now approved in a wild range of tumors: colorectal cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and head and neck cancer. This paper proposes to describe the development of anti-EGFR drugs, highlighting several strategies points. Predicting biomarkers have been extensively studied for these agents, sustaining the hallmarks of the development of molecular targeting drugs.","title":"[EGFR/HER1: a target life].","pubmedId":"21684835"}
