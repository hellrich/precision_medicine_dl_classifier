Biological hypothesis regarding their mechanisms of action as well a potential direct impact on tumor cells are described according to the most recent laboratory as well as hypothesis-generating clinical data.\nTargeting the RANK pathway is an efficient way to prevent complications of bone metastases in NSCLC. Interesting additional direct effects on tumor biology and evolution are being analyzed and prospectively assessed in clinical trials.","title":"Targeting receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B as a new therapy for bone metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23283210"}
