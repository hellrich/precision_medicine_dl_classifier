Despite the progress in diagnosis and treatment of LPS, there is still a high mortality rate due to local recurrence or metastasis. The mechanisms underlying the development of recurrence and metastasis of LPS remain elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate target gene expression, influencing many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, oncogenesis, and drug resistance in malignant cells. The dysregulation of miRs is involved in the initiation and progression of human cancers, including LPS. Functional studies have shown the potent pro- and anti-tumorigenic activity of specific miRs both in vitro and in vivo. miR signatures that are unique to specific types of LPS have been proposed. Several lines of evidence have shown that miRs can act either as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, as well as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for LPS. In addition, miRs may be a powerful therapeutic target in LPS, although obstacles such as delivery of miRs in vivo need to be overcome. In this review, we discuss the emerging roles of miRs in different histological subtypes of LPS.
