It is very likely that a significant proportion of these cancers evolve from undetected sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs). The prevalence and molecular features of the SSAs in the Chinese population have seldom been investigated.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the colonoscopy database and pathology archives in our medical centre. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and β-catenin expressions were examined in 28 right hyperplastic polyps (RHPs) and 21 SSAs by immunohistochemical staining. The mutations of BRAF, KRAS, APC and β-CATENIN were analysed by direct sequencing. The methylation status of APC promoter in these polyps was analysed by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Samples of left hyperplastic polyps, traditional adenomas and CRC were used as controls.\nSSAs accounted for 4.9% of serrated polyps and 1.0% of all colorectal polyps. BRAF((V600E)) mutations were found in 14.3% of SSAs and 7.1% of RHPs. Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was seen in 28.6% of SSAs and 17.9% of RHPs. APC mutations were detected in 57.1% of SSAs and 67.9% of RHPs. APC methylation was detected in 14.3% of RHPs and 23.8% of SSAs.\nThe prevalence of SSAs in a subset of the Chinese population is much lower than that in the Western population. BRAF((V600E)) mutation is not a frequent event in right colon serrated polyps in a subset of the Chinese population. APC mutation is possibly the main cause for the Wnt signalling activation in right colon serrated polyps.","title":"Prevalence and molecular characterisation of the sessile serrated adenoma in a subset of the Chinese population.","pubmedId":"24570042"}
