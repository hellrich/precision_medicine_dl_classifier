Most of the mutations consisted of in-frame deletion or replication from 3 to 48 bp in heterozygous and homozygous fashions, but none of the mutations disrupted the downstream reading frame of the gene. Point mutation and deletion concentrated at 550 - 570 codons but replication clustered within 570 - 585 codons. The mutation pattern in recurrence tissues was the same as the primary ones. Normal tissues adjacent to GIST with or without c-kit gene mutations showed wild type c-kit gene sequence. No mutation was found in exon 9 and 13. Neither c-kit gene expression nor gene mutations was found in 3 leiomyomas, 8 leiomyosarcomas, 2 schwannomas, 2 intra-abdomenal fibromitoses and 8 adenocarcinomas.\nThe mutations in exon 11 of c-kit gene might partially represent one of the molecular mechanisms of GIST. It can be used as a marker for distinguishing benignancy and malignancy of GIST. The mutations did not involve the reading frame. Except for long frame deletion, most mutations also did not affect protein expression. Mutation of c-kit gene in GIST provides a new genotypic marker to distinguish GIST from authentic leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, schwannomas and etc.","title":"[Analysis of c-kit gene mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors].","pubmedId":"15059325"}
