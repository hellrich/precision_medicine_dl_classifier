Furthermore, the comparative accuracy of inexpensive EGFR mutation tests, mutant-enriched (ME)-PCR and high-resolution melt (HRM) has not been determined. Lung tumour DNA from 522 surgically resected stage I-IV NSCLC and matched serum DNA from a subset of 64 subjects was analysed for EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21 using ME-PCR and HRM. Additionally, 97 subjects had previous EGFR DNA sequencing data available for comparison. ME-PCR and HRM detected EGFR mutations in 5% (27 out of 522) of tumour samples. Compared to DNA sequencing, ME-PCR had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99%, while HRM had 100% sensitivity and specificity. Six subjects with EGFR mutation tumours had matched serum, where ME-PCR detected mutations in three samples and HRM in two samples. In the cohort of never-smoker subjects, those with EGFR mutated tumours had worse survival compared with wild-type tumours (30 versus 49 months; p\u003d0.017). ME-PCR and HRM have similar accuracy in detecting EGFR mutations but the prognostic implications of the mutations in resected NSCLC warrants further study.","title":"Screening for activating EGFR mutations in surgically resected nonsmall cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21349912"}
