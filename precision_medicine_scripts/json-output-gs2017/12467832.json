We present an asymptomatic 64-year-old man with an incidental 9-cm GIST that arose in the posterior mediastinum. Wide surgical excision was performed with rotation of an intercostal muscle flap to buttress a surgically created esophageal wall defect. The patient is now free of disease 26 months postoperative. This tumor is defined by the carcinogenic over-expression of KIT-protein, a tyrosine kinase receptor. Accurate diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor is imperative, as specific medical therapy is now available for potential control of recurrent or metastatic disease.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the posterior mediastinum.","pubmedId":"12467832"}
