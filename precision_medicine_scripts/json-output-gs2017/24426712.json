The incidence is on the rise. It is generally diagnosed in late stages. The progression free survival and overall survival still remains low. Majority of oncology research today is driven towards molecular profiling of lung cancer. Receptor tyrosine kinases have emerged as major molecular markers and targets. These are the results of gene mutations or amplifications. There are many developed targets where therapeutic option is available like EGFR, ALK, MET, KRAS and so on. This review features on few important molecular profiles of lung cancer, especially with more therapeutic implications. ","title":"Molecular biology of lung cancer-a review.","pubmedId":"24426712"}
