We report of a 36-year-old never smoker with advanced squamous cell carcinoma, presenting with a left lower lobe lesion, N3 nodal disease and multiple metastases (pleura, adrenal, muscle, bone). Despite squamous histology we decided on molecular testing. IHC for ALK was positive and confirmatory fluorescent in situ hybridization showed translocation of ALK. Although there is little evidence on ALK rearrangements in squamous NSCLC we decided on first line treatment with Crizotinib (250 mg twice daily). Eight and twelve weeks after treatment initiation a whole-body FDG fusion PET/CT scan showed dramatic tumor response with little remaining metabolic uptake in the left lobe and a single bone lesion. This evidence raises the question whether ALK testing should be done in never smokers with squamous NSCLC in the absence of oncogenic driver mutations. To our knowledge, this the first report of first line treatment of full squamous ALK-positive NSCLC with crizotinib.","title":"First line crizotinib in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearranged squamous cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26519123"}
