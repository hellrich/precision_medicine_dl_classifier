It may be involved in angiogenesis and modulation of the vascular functions necessary for tumor development. Although angiomodulin is expressed in colon cancer, there is limited information on it concerning cancer progression. In the present immunohistochemical study, we examined expression of angiomodulin in human colorectal cancer and its relationship with prognosis. A group of 89 surgically resected colorectal cancers was investigated immunohistochemically. In 37 cases (41.6%), angiomodulin was expressed in invading cancer cells. Early recurrence within 12 months after surgery was higher in patients with angiomodulin-expressing cancer than in those without (p \u003c 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier life table revealed that patients with angiomodulin-positive tumor cells had a shorter survival time than those with negative cells (p \u003c 0.01). The prognosis of patients with Dukes\u0027 C and angiomodulin-positive cells was apparently worse than that of patients with Dukes\u0027 D and angiomodulin-negative cells. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression indicated that only angiomodulin expression in cancer cells, lymph node metastasis and age remained significant prognostic variables for survival (p \u003c 0.05). Angiomodulin showed correlations with poor prognosis, indicating that it may be a useful prognostic marker in patients with colorectal cancer.","title":"Expression of angiomodulin (tumor-derived adhesion factor/mac25) in invading tumor cells correlates with poor prognosis in human colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"11400113"}
