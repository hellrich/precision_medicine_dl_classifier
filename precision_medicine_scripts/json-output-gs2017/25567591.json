Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of R132H mutant IDH1 protein, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was employed to detect 1p/19q deletion.\nDeletion of chromosome 1p and/or 19q was detected in 37 cases (37/75, 49.3%), among which co-deletion of 1p and 19q was seen in 34 cases (closely correlated, P \u003c 0.01). Oligodendrogliomas WHOIIhad a slightly higher deletion rate than oligodendrogliomas WHO III, although without statistical significance. Oligodendrogliomas WHO IIand WHO III had a significantly higher deletion rate of chromosome 1p/19q than oligoastrocytomas WHO II and WHO III (P \u003c 0.05). While combined loss of 1p/19q was always detected in oligodendrogliomas when FISH was positive, isolated 1p or 19q deletion was only found in oligoastrocytomas. The expression of R132H mutant IDH1 was detected in 51 of 75 cases (68.0%), in which oligodendrogliomas had a higher positive rate than oligoastrocytomas. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between the expression of R132H mutant IDH1 protein and the presence of combined 1p/19q deletion in oligodendrogliomas (P \u003c 0.05).\nA significant correlation was observed between the expression of R132H mutant protein and 1p/19q LOH.Expression of 132H mutant IDH1 protein is the potential biomarker for predicating the presence of 1p/19q deletion in oligodendrogliomas.","title":"[Correlation of chromosome 1p and 19q status and expression of R132H mutant IDH1 protein in oligodendroglial tumors].","pubmedId":"25567591"}
