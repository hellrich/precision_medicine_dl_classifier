The impact of these alterations on the course of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is still unsettled.\nTumor tissues of 290 (98 male, 192 female) patients were intra-operatively snap frozen or harvested from archival paraffin-embedded blocks and used for extraction of DNA and RNA. Comprehensive analysis of RET/PTC and NTRK1 rearrangements was carried out by multiplex screening RT-PCR, hybrid-specific RT-PCR and sequencing of detected hybrids. A mutation-specific PCR was used for BRAF analysis.\nThe BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 122/290 (42%), RET rearrangements in 20/137 (14.6%), and NTRK1 rearrangements in 15/93 (16.1%) PTCs. One hundred forty one out of 290 (48.6%) PTCs demonstrated none of the genetic alterations studied. Eight PTCs expressed two different mutations (1 RET/PTC + BRAF, 6 NTRK1 + BRAF, 1 RET/PTC + NTRK1). Tumor-specific survival analysis (mean follow-up, 5.5 years) demonstrated no significant difference, but a tendency toward worse prognosis of BRAF-positive patients compared to BRAF-negative patients or rearrangement-positive patients, respectively.\nLong-term follow-up data on large tumor panels are needed to disclose significant survival differences of prognostic predictors on PTC. This study provides further evidence that patients harboring BRAF-V600E-positive PTCs may experience an unfavorable course of the disease compared to patients with tumors carrying other genetic alterations.","title":"Impact of pathognomonic genetic alterations on the prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
