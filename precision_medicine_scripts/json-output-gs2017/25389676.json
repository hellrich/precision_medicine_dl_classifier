Metastatic workup was negative. Cytologic examination of the vitrectomy specimen showed a malignant neoplasm with neuroendocrine differentiation, suspicious for carcinoid tumor. The patient later was found to have a lung lesion presumed to be a carcinoid tumor. She was treated with external beam radiation to the eye, but 1 year later, a new retinal tumor was discovered inferiorly requiring plaque radiotherapy. Soon thereafter, she developed massive intraocular recurrence. The eye was enucleated. Histopathology revealed small round blue cells with round hyperchromatic nuclei. Rosettes were also present within the tumor consistent with retinoblastoma.\nLate-onset retinoblastoma can occur in adults, and the diagnosis can be challenging.","title":"Retinoblastoma in a 48-year-old woman.","pubmedId":"25389676"}
