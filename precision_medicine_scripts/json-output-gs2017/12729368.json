The patient was treated with radiochemotherapy consisting of external beam radiotherapy (50.4 Gy; 1.8 Gy/fraction; 5 fractions/week) plus 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/day, continuous i.v. infusion, days 2-5, week 1 and 5 of radiotherapy) and mitomycin C (10 mg/m2 i.v., day 2, week 1 of radiotherapy).\nAt five years\u0027 follow-up the patient was in good general condition, without any signs of disease according to CT scan, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and tumor marker determination. Multiple random biopsies performed in the ampullary region were negative for tumor growth.\nIn patients with ampullary carcinoma the use of concurrent chemoradiation should be considered, particularly when surgical resection is unfeasible due to medical contraindications or locally advanced disease.","title":"Complete response after chemoradiation in ampullary carcinoma: a case report.","pubmedId":"12729368"}
