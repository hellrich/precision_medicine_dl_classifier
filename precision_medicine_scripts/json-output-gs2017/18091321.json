Using WHO criteria for malignancy (presence of local or lymphovascular invasion and/or metastases), cases were divided into malignant (20 cases) and benign or uncertain (8 cases). Nuclear staining in \u003e1% of cells was considered positive for p53 and bcl-2, whereas membranous staining was considered positive for c-erb B2 (Her-2/neu).\nAll cases were nonimmunoreactive with anti-c-erb B2 (Her-2/neu), but focal granular or diffuse cytoplasmic staining was seen in occasional neoplasms. One malignant PET showed reactivity with anti-p53, whereas all others were negative. bcl-2 reactivity was identified in 15/28 cases: 9/20 malignant PETs and 6/8 others were positive.\nc-erb B2 (Her-2/neu) and p53 are not useful prognostic factors in PET. c-erb B2 (Her-2/neu) staining must be carefully evaluated to avoid the misinterpretation of artifactual/background staining. bcl-2 is occasionally expressed in PET, but the significance of this finding is still to be determined.","title":"Pancreatic endocrine tumors-c-erb B2 (Her-2/neu), bcl-2, and p-53 immunohistochemical testing and their value in assessing prognosis.","pubmedId":"18091321"}
