Satisfactory images were obtained of all the thoracic aorta, except for a small part of the ascending aorta, by use of a biplane transesophageal probe. We defined atherosclerotic lesions as increased echogenicity of the intima (intimal thickening), raised plaque, calcification, ulceration, or aneurysms. Lesions were observed in 97 patients (58%). The incidence of lesions in patients with hypertension (81%) or hypercholesterolemia (80%) was significantly greater than in those without both conditions (37%, p less than 0.005). The incidence of lesions was significantly increased among patients over 60 years old compared with that in patients under 60 (76% vs 42%, p less than 0.005). Patients without either hypertension or hypercholesterolemia showed a marked increase in the incidence of lesions with age (16% at less than 60 yrs vs. 67% at greater than 60 yrs), and no significant influence of these conditions on the incidence of lesions was found in patients over 60. We conclude that hypertension and hypercholesterolemia might be important risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic aorta in relatively younger patients. Age appears to become a more important determinant of such lesions in Japanese patients over 60 years old irrespective of blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels.","title":"Advances in transesophageal echocardiography for the evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions in thoracic aorta--the effects of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and aging on atherosclerotic lesions.","pubmedId":"1625364"}
