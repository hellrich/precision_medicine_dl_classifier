However, resistance commonly develops, which is associated with second site mutations in KIT. Here, we created the first genetically engineered mouse model of the most common second site mutation, KIT-V654A (mouse KIT-V653A), to study in vivo its oncogenic properties and mechanisms of resistance in order to develop next-generation GIST therapies.The knock-in strategy consisted of inserting into the endogenous murine Kit locus a targeting vector containing both the KitV558Δ exon 11 mutation and the KitV653A exon 13 mutation under the control of a floxed neomycin-resistance gene-expression cassette which acts similar to a loxP-STOP-loxP cassette. Treatments included imatinib 45 mg/kg i.p., sunitinib 40 mg/kg p.o., and cabozantinib 60 mg/kg p.o. Tumors were assessed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and western blot.In contrast to our previously published GIST model with a single mutant KitV558Δ allele, the double knock-in KitV558Δ; V653A-neo allele caused perinatal lethality when activated in pre-implantation embryos with a germline EIIa-Cre approach. We therefore sought to restrict the induction of the KitV558Δ;V653A double mutation to the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), the cell of origin of GIST, via the essential ICC lineage survival factor ETV1. The KitV558Δ; V653A-neo/+ mouse was crossed with the Etv1Cre-ERT2/+ mouse expressing Cre recombinase under the Etv1-specific promoter. Systemic administration of tamoxifen at birth in KitV558Δ; V653A-neo/+; Etv1Cre-ERT2/+ mice resulted in cecal GIST development with full penetrance. The tumors were histologically similar to human GIST, stained positive for KIT, and displayed active p-KIT signaling. As expected, high-dose imatinib treatment did not inhibit p-KIT Y719 in these GISTs and did not induce a histologic response. Sunitinib and cabozantinib each had significant anti-tumor effects, as assessed by decreased Ki67 index and increased histologic response. Compared to single mutant KitV558Δ-neo/+; Etv1Cre-ERT2/+ mice, double mutant KitV558Δ; V653A-neo/+; Etv1Cre-ERT2/+ mice developed larger cecal GISTs and had decreased survival.The KitV558Δ; V653A-neo/+; Etv1Cre-ERT2/+ mouse is the first in vivo model of the most common secondary mutation in GIST and the first in vivo demonstration that cell-autonomous expression of mutant KIT in the ICC lineage gives rise to GIST. We have found cabozantinib, an FDA-approved drug, to be an effective therapy in GISTs harboring the V653A mutation. Furthermore, our results suggest the addition of the KIT-V653A second site mutation leads to increased oncogenesis.","title":"The KIT-V654A second site mutation confers perinatal lethality and increased oncogenesis in a mouse model of GIST.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-1038"}
