The cytotoxic interaction between EGFR inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib) and DNA cross-linking agents (e.g. platinum derivatives) might represent a promising combination for the treatment of triple-negative/basal-like breast tumors that are dependent upon EGFR/MEK/ERK signaling. We evaluated the growth and molecular interactions of the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (erbitux) and the DNA cross-linking agent cisplatin (cis-diammedichloroplatinum; CDDP) in the gefitinib-resistant MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line, an in vitro model system that shows many of the recurrent basal-like molecular abnormalities including ER-PR-HER2-negative status, TP53 deficiency, EGFR overexpression, PTEN loss and constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. Unlike other basal-like breast cancer models, MDA-MB-468 cells do not carry mutations of the key DNA repair gene BRCA1. Concurrent treatment with sub-optimal doses of cetuximab significantly enhanced CDDP-induced apoptotic cell death. However, an isobologram-based mathematical assessment of the nature of the interaction revealed a loss of synergism when employing a high-dose of cetuximab. Since BRCA1 depletion has been found to decrease DNA damage repair and cell survival in MDA-MB-468 cells when treated with DNA-damaging drugs, we employed ELISA-based quantitative analyses to measure BRCA1 protein levels in CDDP+/- cetuximab-treated cells. Cetuximab as single agent was as efficient as CDDP at increasing BRCA1 protein expression. Interestingly, cetuximab co-exposure significantly antagonized the ability of CDDP to up-regulate BRCA1 expression. Low-scale phosphor-proteomic approaches [i.e. phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) Array Proteome Profiler capable of simultaneously identifying the relative levels of phosphorylation of 42 different RTKs and 23 different MAPKs and other serine/threonine kinases, respectively] revealed the ability of Cetuximab, as single agent, to paradoxically induce hyper-phosphorylation of EGFR while concomitantly deactivating p42/44 (ERK1/ERK2) MAPK. Unexpectedly, ELISA-based quantitative analyses of EGFR protein content demonstrated that simultaneous exposure to cetuximab and optimal doses of CDDP completely depleted EGFR protein in MDA-MB-468 cells. Although these findings preclinically support, at least in part, ongoing clinical trials for \u0027triple-negative/basal-like\u0027 metastatic breast cancer patients who are receiving either cetuximab alone versus cetuximab plus carboplatin (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00232505), the unexpected ability of CDDP to promote a complete depletion of the cetuximab target EGFR further suggests that treatment schedules, cetuximab/CDDP doses and BRCA1 status should be carefully considered when combining anti-EGFR antibodies and platinum derivatives in triple-negative/basal-like breast carcinomas.","title":"Growth and molecular interactions of the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab and the DNA cross-linking agent cisplatin in gefitinib-resistant MDA-MB-468 cells: new prospects in the treatment of triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer.","pubmedId":"19020749"}
