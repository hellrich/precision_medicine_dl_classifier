This challenge underscores an unmet need for developing personalized medicine strategies to refine the current treatment decision-making process. To derive a prognostic gene signature for patients with early stage PDAC, a PDAC cohort from Moffitt Cancer Center (n \u003d 63) was used with overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint. This was further evaluated using an independent microarray cohort dataset (Stratford et al: n \u003d 102). Technical validation was performed by NanoString platform. A prognostic 15-gene signature was developed and showed a statistically significant association with OS in the Moffitt cohort (hazard ratio [HR] \u003d 3.26; p\u003c0.001) and Stratford et al cohort (HR \u003d 2.07; p \u003d 0.02), and was independent of other prognostic variables. Moreover, integration of the signature with the TNM staging system improved risk prediction (p\u003c0.01 in both cohorts). In addition, NanoString validation showed that the signature was robust with a high degree of reproducibility and the association with OS remained significant in the two cohorts. The gene signature could be a potential prognostic tool to allow risk-adapted stratification of PDAC patients into personalized treatment protocols; possibly improving the currently poor clinical outcomes of these patients.
