The following experiments are to elucidate this anti-apoptotic mechanism, then the effect of c-Met on autophagy has also been discussed.\nInvestigated was the influence of c-Met on apoptosis, autophagy and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm), and the relevant proteins were examined.\nFirst, we found that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p53 was promoted by c-Met interference. Subsequent studies indicated that ERK was the upstream effector of p53, and this ERK-p53 pathway mediated release of cytochrome c and up-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Secondly, the inhibition of c-Met augmented oridonin-induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm), resulting apoptosis. Finally, the inhibition of c-Met increased oridonin-induced A549 cell autophagy accompanied by Beclin-1 activation and conversion from microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II. Activation of ERK-p53 was also detected in autophagy process and could be augmented by inhibition of c-Met. Moreover, suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or small interfering RNA against Beclin-1 or Atg5 decreased oridonin-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of apoptosis by pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) decreased oridonin-induced autophagy as well and Loss of Δψm also occurred during autophagic process.\nThus, inhibiting c-Met enhanced oridonin-induced apoptosis, autophagy and loss of Δψm in A549 cells.","title":"Inhibition of c-Met promoted apoptosis, autophagy and loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in oridonin-induced A549 lung cancer cells.","pubmedId":"24102522"}
