We report on a case where gamma knife therapy for a 4 cm diameter right cerebellopontine meningioma accelerated hydrocephalus three months post treatment. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed a high protein level and thus, CSF malabsorption and CSF obstruction might have occurred after the radio surgery. It is important to consider this pathology, and the need for long term follow up.","title":"Normal pressure hydrocephalus after gamma knife radiosurgery for cerebellopontine angle meningioma.","pubmedId":"15337152"}
