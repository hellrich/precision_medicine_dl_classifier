However, clinical efficacy is limited by the development of resistance. The most common mechanism of resistance is a second site mutation within exon 20 of EGFR (T790M), observed in 50% of cases. CO-1686 is an irreversible kinase inhibitor that targets the mutant forms of EGFR by inhibiting the common activating mutations (L858R, delE746-A750) and the gatekeeper mutation (T790M) but not the wild-type receptor. Therefore, CO-1686 has the potential to effectively treat first- and second-line NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations without causing the dose limiting toxicities associated with approved EGFR kinase inhibitors or those in clinical development. Experimental procedures: Using structure-based drug design, CO-1686, a covalent, irreversible small molecule, which selectively inhibits mutant EGFR, was identified. CO-1686 potency was assessed against four common EGFR mutations (L858R, delE746-A750, L858R/T790M and delE746-A750/T790M) using in vitro biochemical and cell-based assays. Antitumor activity of CO-1686 as a single agent was assessed in NSCLC xenograft models harboring EGFR mutations: H1975 (L858R/T790M) and HCC827 (delE746-A750). Pharmacodynamic studies were performed to evaluate effects on cell survival and EGFR signaling. Results: In vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies focused on evaluating CO-1686 potency in four EGFR mutations common in NSCLC patients: L858R, delE746-A750, L858R/T790M and delE746-A750/T790M. CO-1686 was shown to be active against all four EGFR mutants. Effects of CO-1686 on cell proliferation and EGFR signaling were evaluated in HCC827 cells (delE746-A750) and its erlotinib-resistant clone, HCC827-EPR harboring the second site mutation T790M (delE746-A750/T790M). CO-1686 inhibited cell proliferation in both cell lines equally (GI50 values of 12 nM in the parental line and 19 nM in the T790M-positive clone). In mouse xenograft studies, oral dosing of CO-1686 in H1975 double mutant (L858R/T790M) and in HCC827 single mutant (delE746-A750) models caused tumor shrinkage as a single agent in a dose-dependent manner. Different dosing schedules were explored. Conclusions: Our results establish CO-1686 as a potent, mutant-selective EGFR inhibitor with excellent in vivo activity in mice bearing tumors with activating EGFR mutations as well as the resistance mutation T790M. These data suggest that treatment with CO-1686 as a single agent can overcome T790M-mediated drug resistance in NSCLC. Initially, clinical development will focus on NSCLC patients with mutant EGFR.","title":"CO-1686, a novel mutant-selective EGFR inhibitor, overcomes T790M mediated resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1791"}
