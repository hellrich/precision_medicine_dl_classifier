As tumours with microsatellite instability (MSI) may confound the effect of S-CRC methylation on outcome, we addressed this issue in a series of CRC characterised by BRAF and MS status.\nDemographics, clinicopathological records and disease-specific survival (DSS) were assessed in 881 consecutively resected CRC undergoing complete colonoscopy. All tumours were typed for BRAF(c.1799T\u003eA) mutation and MS status, followed by search of germ-line mutation in patients with MSI CRC.\nSynchronous colorectal cancers (50/881, 5.7%) were associated with stage IV microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRC (19/205, 9.3%, P\u003d0.001) and with HNPCC (9/32, 28%, P\u003c0.001). BRAF mutation (60/881, 6.8%) was associated with sporadic MSI CRC (37/62, 60%, P\u003c0.001) but not with S-CRC (3/50, 6.0%, P\u003d0.96). Synchronous colorectal cancer (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.15-2.87; P\u003d0.01), synchronous advanced adenoma (HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.27-2.58; P\u003d0.001), and BRAF(c.1799T\u003eA) mutation (HR 2.16; 95% CI 1.25-3.73; P\u003d0.01) were stage-independent predictors of death from MSS CRC. Disease-specific survival of MSI CRC patients was not affected by S-CRC (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.09-5.75; P\u003d0.77).\nMicrosatellite-stable CRCs have a worse prognosis if S-CRC or synchronous advanced adenoma are diagnosed. The occurrence and the enhanced aggressiveness of synchronous MSS advanced neoplasia are not associated with BRAF mutation.","title":"Molecular heterogeneity and prognostic implications of synchronous advanced colorectal neoplasia.","pubmedId":"24434431"}
