Given the high prevalence of MYC amplification in tumours of BRCA1 mutation carriers and the similarities between these and sporadic \"basal-like\" carcinomas, the prevalence of MYC amplification in \"basal-like\" breast carcinomas was investigated.\nMYC gene copy number was assessed on tissue microarrays containing duplicate cores of 245 invasive breast carcinomas by means of chromogenic in situ hybridisation using SpotLight C-MYC amplification probe and chromosome 8 centromeric probe (CEP8). Signals were evaluated at 400x magnification; 30 morphologically unequivocal neoplastic cells in each core were counted for the presence of the gene and CEP8 probes.\nAmplification was defined as a MYC:CEP8 ratio \u003e2. Signals for both MYC and CEP8 were assessable in 196/245 (80%) tumours. MYC amplification was found in 19/196 cases (9.7%) and was not associated with tumour size, histological grade, positivity for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, epidermal growth factor, cytokeratins 14, 5/6 and 17, MIB1 or p53. Only 4% of basal-like carcinomas showed MYC amplification, compared to 8.75% and 10.7% of luminal and HER2 tumours respectively. On univariate analysis, MYC amplification displayed a significant association with shorter metastasis-free and overall survival and proved to be an independent prognostic factor on multivariate survival analysis.\nMYC amplification is not associated with \"basal-like\" phenotype and proved to be an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy.","title":"MYC amplification in breast cancer: a chromogenic in situ hybridisation study.","pubmedId":"17158641"}
