A growing interest in developing orally active protein-kinase inhibitors has recently culminated in the approval of the first of these drugs for clinical use. Protein kinases have now become the second most important group of drug targets, after G-protein-coupled receptors. Here, I give a personal view of some of the most important advances that have shaped this field.","title":"Protein kinases--the major drug targets of the twenty-first century?","pubmedId":"12120282"}
