Her bladder and bowel function were not affected. Following extensive workup, the most likely etiology was presumed radiation-induced lumbosacral plexopathy.\nAlthough metastatic carcinoma is more commonly the reason for progressive lower extremity weakness with pelvic pain in women with advanced cervical cancer, radiation-induced lumbosacral plexopathy, a rare but devastating complication, may be the cause. Diagnosis is by exclusion.","title":"Acute lower extremity paralysis following radiation therapy for cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"10502444"}
