The use of adjuvant chemotherapy post-resection has been established in treating micro metastases and prolonging disease-free survival. However, studies of neoadjuvant therapy have not come to any definitive conclusion regarding the overall efficacy of such treatment, despite the theoretical benefits. In this review, we examine the historical precedent as well as the current state of affairs regarding neoadjuvant therapy in resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In addition, we review the definitions for resectable and borderline resectable disease and highlight key areas of clinical investigation in the field and summarize the major ongoing neoadjuvant studies focused on resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
