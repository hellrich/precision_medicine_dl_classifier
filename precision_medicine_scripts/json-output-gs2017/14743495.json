Different patterns of emphysema are, however, recognized, suggesting possible different pathogenetic processes within the lung. This, coupled with the associated idea of susceptibility factors to the development of emphysema, has led to studies of genes that may be involved in the defence of the lung from proteolytic and oxidative damage. These studies have been driven by the goal of finding a treatment for emphysema, but appear to have lost sight of the fundamental remodelling of the lung that has occurred in patients with emphysema and the fact that it is not a single morphological entity.","title":"Emphysema: the challenge of the remodelled lung.","pubmedId":"14743495"}
