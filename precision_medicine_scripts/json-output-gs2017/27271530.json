We have recently identified OLA1 as a novel BRCA1/BARD1-interacting protein. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate whether any genetic mutations in OLA1 are detected among patients with suspected HBOC without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.\nAmong 53 patients with suspected HBOC enrolled at Hoshi General Hospital, 23 patients without any BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were analyzed for OLA1 mutations. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood samples. PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed to elucidate whether there were any mutations in any of the ten exons and flanking introns of the OLA1 gene.\nNo germline sequence variation was detected in the OLA1 gene among the 23 patients enrolled in this study.\nNo germline mutations were found in the OLA1 gene among the cohort of patients with suspected HBOC without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Further studies are needed to clarify whether other mutations/epigenetic alterations are involved in the pathogenesis of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation-negative inherited disease with breast or ovarian cancer.","title":"OLA1 gene sequencing in patients with BRCA1/2 mutation-negative suspected hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.","pubmedId":"27271530"}
