The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between EGFR mutation status in serum and predicting benefit from EGFR-TKIs therapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nWe examined EGFR mutation status in serum of 80 patients with advanced, EGFR-TKIs given as first-line therapy NSCLC. All patients were received long-term follow-up, and the drug efficacy were observed and evaluated.\nThe EGFR mutation in serum was detected in 33.8% (27/80) of NSCLC patients examined, in which exon 19 deletion mutation was present at a frequency of 44.4% (12/27) and exon 21 point mutation was 55.6% (15/27); The response rate to EGFR-TKI in patients with EGFR mutation in serum was (55.6%, 15/27), which was remarkably higher than that in EGFR wild-type patients (17.0%, 9/53), the difference was statistically significant (χ²\u003d0.370, P\u003c0.001); The median progression free survival (PFS) of patients with EGFR mutation in serum was remarkably better than that of EGFR wild-type patients (9.8 months vs 5.7 months, P\u003d0.014).\nIn patients with advanced, EGFR-positive in serum NSCLC, EGFR-TKIs given as first-line therapy is associated with improved drug efficacy. The results suggest that it is feasible to use serum to detect EGFR mutation, which can predict a benefit from EGFR-TKIs given as first-line therapy.\n背景与目的 小分子酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs）对于表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）基因突变的肺癌患者显示出良好的治疗效果。本研究旨在探讨晚期非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）患者血清EGFR基因突变状态与EGFR-TKIs疗效的关系。 方法 检测80例一线口服EGFR-TKIs晚期NSCLC患者血清EGFR基因的突变状态，对患者进行长期随访并评价治疗效果。结果 80例患者血清EGFR基因突变27例（33.8%），其中外显子19缺失突变12例（44.4%），外显子21点突变15例（55.6%）；血清EGFR基因突变患者的有效率（55.6%, 15/27）高于野生型患者（17.0%, 9/53），差异具有统计学意义（χ2\u003d0.370, P\u003c0.001）；血清EGFR基因突变患者中位无进展生存时间（progress free survival, PFS）明显长于野生型患者（9.8个月 vs 5.7个月，P\u003d0.014）。结论 血清EGFR基因突变患者一线口服EGFR-TKIs的疗效优于野生型患者，血清EGFR基因状态可为EGFR-TKIs的一线治疗提供有效依据。","title":"[Detection and evaluation of EGFR mutation status in serum of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR-TKIs].","pubmedId":"23769345"}
