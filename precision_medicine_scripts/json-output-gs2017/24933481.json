Emerging data suggests that in addition to direct effects mediated through the canonical Notch pathway, Notch may participate in epithelial tumor development through regulation of pathways such as PTEN/PI3K/Akt. Prostate cancer is a disease for which PTEN gene expression is especially essential. This review will summarize a role for Notch in prostate development and cancer with an emphasis on how the Notch pathway may intersect with PTEN/PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling.
