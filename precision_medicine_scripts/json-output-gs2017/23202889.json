Of the three human ras isoforms, KRAS is the most frequently altered gene, with mutations occurring in 17%-25% of all cancers. In particular, approximately 30%-40% of colon cancers harbor a KRAS mutation. KRAS mutations in colon cancers have been associated with poorer survival and increased tumor aggressiveness. Additionally, KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer lead to resistance to select treatment strategies. In this review we examine the history of KRAS, its prognostic value in patients with colorectal cancer, and evidence supporting its predictive value in determining appropriate therapies for patients with colorectal cancer.","title":"Prognostic and predictive roles of KRAS mutation in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"23202889"}
