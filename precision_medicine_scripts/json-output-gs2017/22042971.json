This study aimed to discover microRNAs (miRNA) that target KIT and reveal the relationship between the discovered miRNAs and KIT expression in GISTs.\nFresh-frozen GISTs from 31 patients were used to confirm the relationship between miR-494 and KIT expression using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to assess miR-494 expression levels and Western blotting to assess KIT protein expression levels. A luciferase assay was conducted for the target evaluation. The functional effects of miR-494 on GIST882 cells (GIST cell line with activating KIT mutation) were validated by a cell proliferation assay and fluoresce-activated cell sorting analysis.\nAn inverse relationship was found between the expression levels of miR-494 and KIT in GISTs (r \u003d -0.490, P \u003d 0.005). The direct targeting of KIT by miR-494 was shown by the reduction in KIT expression after miR-494 overexpression and the increase in KIT expression after inhibiting endogenous miR-494 expression. We showed that miR-494 regulates KIT by binding two different seed match sites. Induced miR-494 overexpression in GIST882 reduced the expression of downstream molecules in KIT signaling transduction pathways, including phospho-AKT and phospho-STAT3. Finally, miR-494 overexpression provoked apoptosis and inhibited GIST cell growth, which were accompanied by changes in G(1) and S phase content.\nOur findings indicate that miR-494 is a negative regulator of KIT in GISTs and overexpressing miR-494 in GISTs may be a promising approach to GIST treatment.","title":"MicroRNA-494 downregulates KIT and inhibits gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell proliferation.","pubmedId":"22042971"}
