The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), a self-report measure that assesses the effects of fatigue on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning, in a sample of nondemented PD patients.\nPD patients (N \u003d 100) completed the MFIS, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X), and several additional measures of psychosocial, cognitive, and motor functioning. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and item analysis using Cronbach\u0027s alpha were conducted to determine structural validity and internal consistency of the MFIS. Correlational analyses were performed between the MFIS and the PANAS-X fatigue subscale to evaluate convergent validity and between the MFIS and measures of depression, anxiety, apathy, and disease-related symptoms to determine divergent validity.\nThe PCA identified two viable MFIS subscales: a cognitive subscale and a combination of the original scale\u0027s physical and psychosocial subscales as one factor. Item analysis revealed high internal consistency of all 21 items and the items within the two subscales. The MFIS had strong convergent validity with the PANAS-X fatigue subscale and adequate divergent validity with measures of disease stage, motor function, and cognition.\nOverall, this study demonstrates that the MFIS is a valid multidimensional measure that can be used to evaluate the impact of fatigue on cognitive and physical/social functioning in PD patients without dementia.","title":"Validation of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale in Parkinson\u0027s disease.","pubmedId":"23246138"}
