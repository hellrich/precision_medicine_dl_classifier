Forty-three patients (47%) had a partial remission and 38 (42%) had a stable disease. Thirteen patients (14%) were radically resected yielding one pathologic complete remission. Median survival (OS) was 16.2 months. Median progression-free survival was 9.9 months. Pattern of failure consisted of isolated local failure (N \u003d 26, 35%); both local and systemic failure (N \u003d 14, 19%); isolated systemic failure (N \u003d 35, 47%).\nCombination chemotherapy with four-drug regimens followed by chemoradiation was a feasible strategy showing relevant results in stage III pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"Outcome of upfront combination chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation for locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19381632"}
