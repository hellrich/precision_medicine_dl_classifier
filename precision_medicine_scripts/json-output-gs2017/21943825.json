Amplification of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and deletion of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are implicated in Trastuzumab resistance, however, the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly defined. Activation of Rac1, a member of Rho GTPase family, is capable of causing cytoskeleton reorganization, regulating gene expression and promoting cell proliferation. To investigate the mechanism of Trastuzumab resistance, PTEN knockdown and IGF-IR overexpressing stable cell lines were generated in HER2 overexpression human breast cancer SKBR3 cells. Rac1 was highly activated in PTEN deficient and IGF-IR overexpressing Trastuzumab-resistant cells in a HER2-independent manner. Inactivation of Rac1 by using a Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 or siRNA knocking down the expression of Tiam1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac, significantly reduced Trastuzumab resistance in SKBR3 cells. Inhibition of Rac1 had no effect on the levels of phosphor-HER2 and phosphor-Akt, but significantly decreased the levels of cyclin D1 in Trastuzumab-resistant cells. Inhibition of Akt with an Akt inhibitor also significantly reduced Trastuzumab resistance. However, simultaneous inhibition of both Rac1 and Akt resulted in a significantly more decrease of Trastuzumab resistance than inactivation of Rac1 or Akt alone. These results suggest that Rac1 activation is critically involved in Trastuzumab resistance caused by PTEN deletion or IGF-IR overexpression. Simultaneous inhibition of Rac1 and Akt may represent a promising strategy in reducing Trastuzumab resistance in HER2 overexpression breast cancer.","title":"Inactivation of Rac1 reduces Trastuzumab resistance in PTEN deficient and insulin-like growth factor I receptor overexpressing human breast cancer SKBR3 cells.","pubmedId":"21943825"}
