Novel exploratory endpoints include tumor kinetics, treatment post-progression, circulating tumor DNA, and blood-based biomarkers.   Methods: Pts with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable locally advanced recurrent NSCLC (no prior EGFR TKI therapy and no CNS disease), with documentation of  1 activating EGFR mutation (excluding exon 20 insertions) will be enrolled in this phase 2, open-label study (NCT02186301). Pts will be randomized 1:1 to rociletinib (625 mg) twice daily or erlotinib (150 mg) once daily until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1. Pts will be stratified by sensitizing EGFR mutation (T790M, del19, L858R, or other) and race (Asian vs non-Asian). The primary endpoint is PFS; secondary endpoints include efficacy as determined by objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate and overall survival, and PFS in pts with baseline T790M mutations detected using allele-specific PCR. PFS and OS will be summarized with Kaplan-Meier plots. The stratified log-rank and hazard ratio will compare PFS distributions for rociletinib- vs erlotinib-treated pts. Safety will be assessed via standard adverse event reporting. Planned enrollment is for phase 2 is 200 pts up to 1000 for phase 3. Enrollment is underway with multiple patients in screening.
