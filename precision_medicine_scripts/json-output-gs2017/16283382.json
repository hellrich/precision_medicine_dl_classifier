The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of real-time PCR SNP analysis as a new technique in the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis at the E-cadherin gene locus in sporadic colon cancer.\nOne-hundred cases of human sporadic colon cancer and corresponding normal tissue samples were analyzed using two flanking polymorphic markers commonly used in the LOH analysis at the E-cadherin gene locus by conventional VNTR-LOH analysis. Two intragenic E-cadherin SNP markers were analyzed using real-time PCR SNP analysis.\nLOH (17.6%) was detected using flanking markers, however, no LOH was detected when the intragenic E-cadherin SNP markers were introduced into our study. Since these markers are intragenic they more accurately represent the status of the E-cadherin gene than the previously used flanking markers.\nIn conclusion, real-time PCR SNP analysis was found to be more accurate, faster, simpler, and a more high-throughput method than the conventional VNTR-LOH analysis.","title":"Loss of heterozygosity testing using real-time PCR analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms.","pubmedId":"16283382"}
