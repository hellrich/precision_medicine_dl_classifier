We used the 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) scoring criteria to evaluate HER2 amplification status in 175 cases of breast carcinoma with chromosome 17 polysomy. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine the HER2 amplification status, and 2-color FISH to detect CEP17, and reviewed the results of initial evaluation using the 2007 ASCO/CAP criteria. Of the 175 cases, 17, 95, and 63 were IHC 0/1+, 2+, and 3+, respectively. Evaluation of IHC HER2 status according to the 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria identified significantly more HER2-positive cases compared to cases evaluated using the 2007 criteria (p\u003c0.05). When the FISH results were evaluated in parallel with the 2013 criteria, we found that 22 cases were not HER2-negative despite the presence of polysomy 17, which, according to the 2013 criteria, indicates HER2-positive status. Our findings indicate that in breast carcinoma, HER2 status in the presence of polysomy 17 may vary with the scoring criteria used. In turn, performing FISH and evaluating samples using the 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria means that more patients with breast cancer may be appropriate for targeted treatment with trastuzumab, potentially improving their outcome.
