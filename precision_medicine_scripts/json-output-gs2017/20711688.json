It is estimated that 5-10% of all patients with pancreatic cancer have a first-degree relative with the disease, while up to 20% of cases have a hereditary component. Individuals who carry a germline mutation in the BRCA 1 or 2 genes have an increased lifetime risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma when compared with the general population.\nHere, we present a case of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma arising in a 67-year-old carrier of a BRCA 1 germline mutation.\nIn patients with known BRCA 1 or 2 mutation-associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the addition of a DNA cross-linking agent such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin, or mitomycin to a standard gemcitabine chemotherapy backbone should be considered. Poly ADP-ribose inhibitors are a novel class of drug, which have demonstrated promising efficacy in trials of BRCA 1 and 2 mutant breast and ovarian cancer, and are currently undergoing prospective evaluation in advanced pancreatic cancer.","title":"A 67-year-old woman with BRCA 1 mutation associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20711688"}
