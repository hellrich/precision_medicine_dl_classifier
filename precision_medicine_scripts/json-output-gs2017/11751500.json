PTEN mutations have been described in several types of human cancer. Recently, mutations at an (A)(6) repeat of PTEN exons 7 and 8 in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with microsatellite instability have been detected. Moreover, an involvement of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pathway in hereditary colorectal syndromes has been proposed.\nIn this study, we analyzed the frequency of PTEN gene mutations in 36 CRC patients and 5 colon cancer cell lines. Furthermore, in 16 of 36 patients, microsatellite instability and TGF-beta receptor II analysis was possible. The study was performed by PCR and automated sequencing of the entire coding region of the PTEN gene.\nAbout 17% of colon cancer patients and one of five (HSR 320) colon cancer cell lines had mutations. Mutations were detected only among patients with locally advanced or metastatic CRC. PTEN mutations were detected in three of five (60%) patients showing both microsatellite instability and TGF-beta receptor II mutations. These patients presented with advanced or metastatic CRC CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results show that PTEN alteration together with TGF-beta pathway inactivation could contribute to tumorigenesis and metastatic spread of sporadic and microsatellite unstable CRC.","title":"Colorectal carcinomas and PTEN/MMAC1 gene mutations.","pubmedId":"11751500"}
