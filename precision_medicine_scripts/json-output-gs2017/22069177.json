The management of high risk patients should be evidence based. However, prospective data and a consensus for guidelines concerning the screening of asymptomatic high risk patients and surveillance following multidisciplinary treatment do not exist. This review provides an overview of GIST, with an emphasis on the available data regarding screening and surveillance of certain populations with GISTs.","title":"Surveillance strategies for gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"22069177"}
