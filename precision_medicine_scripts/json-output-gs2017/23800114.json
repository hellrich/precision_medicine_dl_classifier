Here, we investigated the occurrence, clinicopathological correlates and prognostic significance of specific KRAS mutations in tumours from 153 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cases from a pooled, prospective cohort.\nKRAS codon 12,13 and 61 mutations were analysed by pyrosequencing in tumours from 163 incident EOC cases in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study and Malmö Preventive Project. Associations of mutational status with clinicopathological and molecular characteristics were assessed by Pearson Chi Square test. Ovarian cancer-specific survival (OCSS) according to mutational status was explored by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling. KRAS-mutation status was also analysed in 28 concomitantly sampled benign-appearing fallopian tubes.\nSeventeen (11.1%) EOC cases harboured mutations in the KRAS gene, all but one in codon 12, and one in codon 13. No KRAS mutations were found in codon 61 and all examined fallopian tubes were KRAS wild-type. KRAS mutation was significantly associated with lower grade (p \u003d 0.001), mucinous histological subtype (p \u003d \u003c 0.001) and progesterone receptor expression (p \u003d 0.035). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly improved OCSS for patients with KRAS-mutated compared to KRAS wild-type tumours (p \u003d 0.015). These associations were confirmed in unadjusted Cox regression analysis (HR \u003d 2.51; 95% CI 1.17-5.42) but did not remain significant after adjustment for age, grade and clinical stage. The beneficial prognostic impact of KRAS mutation was ony evident in tumours of low-intermediate differentiation grade (p \u003d 0.023), and in a less advanced clinical stage (p \u003d 0.014). Moreover, KRAS mutation was associated with a significantly improved OCSS in the subgroup of endometroid carcinomas (p \u003d 0.012).\nThe results from this study confirm previously demonstrated associations of KRAS mutations with well-differentiated and mucinous ovarian carcinomas. Moreover, KRAS-mutated tumours had a significantly improved survival in unadjusted, but not adjusted, analysis. A finding that merits further study is the significant prognostic impact of KRAS mutation in endometroid carcinomas, potentially indicating that response to Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK-targeting therapies may differ by histological subtype.\nThe virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1788330379100147.","title":"Clinicopathological correlates and prognostic significance of KRAS mutation status in a pooled prospective cohort of epithelial ovarian cancer.","pubmedId":"23800114"}
