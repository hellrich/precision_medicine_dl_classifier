His pulmonary function was severely impaired because of asbestosis and emphysema. Chest computed tomography showed severe emphysema with bilateral multiple bullae. Although chest drainage tubes were placed in the bilateral thorax, the left lung did not completely expand due to a persistent air leak. We performed VATS while retaining the patient\u0027s spontaneous respiration under general sedation with regional epidural anesthesia, since one-lung, positive pressure ventilation was considered to be difficult to achieve. After the airway was secured by a laryngeal-mask, the bullae were then thoracoscopically resected. The pneumothorax improved after surgery.","title":"[A case of surgical treatment for a bilateral pneumothorax that occurred in a patient with severe asbestosis and advanced emphysema].","pubmedId":"24800531"}
