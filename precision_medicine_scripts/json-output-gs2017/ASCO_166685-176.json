Treatment response can be monitored by tracking tumor DNA released into the circulation as free circulating DNA (fcDNA). We studied the dynamics of BRAF V600E mutations in fcDNA isolated from patients (pts) with non-melanoma cancers during targeted therapy. Methods: Pts with exhausted treatment options included in the Copenhagen Prospective Personalized Oncology (CoPPO) research program were selected for targeted therapy against actionable driver mutations identified in freshly obtained tumor biopsies by whole exome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2500). In pts with non-melanoma cancers harboring mutant BRAF V600E, plasma samples were collected at baseline and during targeted treatment. fcDNA was isolated and allele frequency of BRAF V600E mutations were quantified using droplet digital PCR. Results: Among 300+ patients included in the CoPPO research program, BRAF V600E mutations were identified in six patients with non-melanoma cancers who received targeted therapy (NSCLC, n \u003d 1; bile duct cancer, n \u003d 3; colon cancer, n \u003d 2). Treatments included BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib or vemurafenib) alone or in combination with MEK (trametinib) or EGFR inhibitors (panitumumab or cetuximab, colon cancer pts only). All pts but one had reductions in the size of target tumors. Two pts had partial responses as assessed by RECIST 1.1. The allele frequency of BRAF V600E increased within the first 24 hours after treatment initiation and subsequently decreased substantially. Dynamics of allele frequency correlated closely to treatment response. In all cases, timing of changes in allele frequency preceded documented radiological treatment response and/or progression. Analyses of tumor biopsies obtained post-treatment are ongoing. Conclusions: Targeting BRAF mutations in non-melanoma cancers seems feasible with the achievement of clinically relevant tumor activity. Quantitative measurements of BRAF V600E mutations in fcDNA represent a useful method to monitor treatment outcome.
