We examined the antitumor action of the MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066) in gastric cancer cells positive or negative for MET amplification. Inhibition of MET signaling by crizotinib or RNA interference-mediated MET depletion resulted in induction of apoptosis accompanied by inhibition of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in gastric cancer cells with MET amplification but not in those without it, suggesting that MET signaling is essential for the survival of MET amplification-positive cells. Crizotinib upregulated the expression of BIM, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as well as downregulated that of survivin, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and c-IAP1, members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, in cells with MET amplification. Forced depletion of BIM inhibited crizotinib-induced apoptosis, suggesting that upregulation of BIM contributes to the proapoptotic effect of crizotinib. Crizotinib also exhibited a marked antitumor effect in gastric cancer xenografts positive for MET amplification, whereas it had little effect on those negative for this genetic change. Crizotinib thus shows a marked antitumor action both in vitro and in vivo specifically in gastric cancer cells positive for MET amplification.","title":"Antitumor action of the MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066) in gastric cancer positive for MET amplification.","pubmedId":"22729845"}
