The two taxanes (paclitaxel, Taxol, Bristol-Myers Squibb and docetaxel, Taxotere, Rh√¥ne-Poulenc Rorer) share some characteristics, but are also significantly different both in preclinical profile and, most importantly, in clinical characteristics. The main clinical differences are related to their different efficacy-toxicity ratio in relation to dose and schedule; the differing integrability of paclitaxel and docetaxel in anthracycline-taxane containing regimens, secondary to major differences in pharmacokinetic interactions between each taxane and the anthracyclines, and; the potential differences in level of synergism between each taxane and herceptin (HeR2Neu antibody/trastuzumab, Genentech/Roche). In clinical practice, the taxanes are now standard therapy in metastatic breast cancer after prior chemotherapy, in particular anthracyclines, has failed. Their role in combination with anthracyclines in first-line therapy of advanced breast cancer is emerging and sheds new light on the potential role of taxanes in the adjuvant setting. However, the impact of taxanes on the natural history of breast cancer is yet to be defined, despite the trend of results suggesting that these agents have the potential for significant improvements in advanced and, most importantly, adjuvant therapy of breast cancer. The results of all completed or ongoing Phase III trials in first-line metastatic and the adjuvant setting will help determine if taxanes will further improve the outcome of breast cancer or not.","title":"Chemotherapy of breast cancer: are the taxanes going to change the natural history of breast cancer?","pubmedId":"11249542"}
