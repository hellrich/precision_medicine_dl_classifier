In naive control animals as well as in animals injected with non-encephalitogenic, PPD-reactive T lymphocytes, FGF-2 immunoreactivity was low and confined to blood vessels and to a few spinal cord neurons. In rats injected with encephalitogenic, MBP-reactive T lymphocytes, however, FGF-2-immunoreactive cells were detected from day 4 after T cell transfer onward, i.e., from the onset of clinical symptoms. The number of FGF-2 immunoreactive cells was highest between days 6 and 10 after T cell transfer. Increased FGF-2 peptide expression was paralleled by increased FGF-2 mRNA expression on macrophages/microglia in the spinal cord. By 21 days after T cell transfer, i.e. after complete recovery, FGF-2 peptide and mRNA expression had fully subsided. Based on morphological criteria and on double labeling with the macrophage/microglia-binding lectin GSI-B4 two cell types expressed FGF-2: 1) round macrophages within the core, and 2) activated microglia at the edges of white and grey matter perivascular lesions. Paralleling the temporal and spatial expression pattern of FGF-2, FGFR-1/flg immunoreactivity was induced on activated macrophages/microglia but also on reactive astrocytes bordering perivascular inflammatory lesions. In situ hybridisation analysis furthermore showed that macrophages/microglia expressed the FGFR-1/flg mRNA, and that receptor mRNA expression paralleled ligand mRNA expression. Macrophage/microglia-derived FGF-2 could serve two main functions in EAE: 1) regulate microglial activation in an autocrine fashion, and 2) help to target astrocyte-derived insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) to potentially injured oligodendrocytes in demyelination.","title":"Differential expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 and receptor by glial cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)","pubmedId":"8929896"}
