Epicardial adipose tissue is a novel cardio-metabolic risk factor. Our aim was to evaluate epicardial fat thickness (EFT) using echocardiography in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy control subjects. Secondly, we investigated relationship between epicardial fat thickness and clinical and echocardiographic parameters in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe study population included 76 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (64 female; mean age, 53 ±11 years, median disease duration, 7.8 years) and 50 healthy subjects as controls (39 female; mean age, 52 ± 6 years). All patients underwent echocardiography to assess left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy and EFT. All values were compared between groups.\nEFT was higher in rheumatoid arthritis patients than in healthy controls (0.66±0.20 vs. 0.54±0.18; p\u003d 0.003). Thickness of Intra Ventricular Septum (IVS) (1.1±0.06 and 9.8±0.08; p\u003d0.001) and posterior wall (PW) (0.98±0.05 and 0.93±0.08; p\u003d0.015) was higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy controls. Early diastolic myocardiac peak velocity or late diastolic mitral peak velocity (E/A) ratio was lower in rheumatoid arthritis patients compared to healthy patients (1.1 ±0.8 and 1.24±0.1 p\u003d0.001) as well as, E/e\u0027 was higher in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients than healthy patients. (E/e\u0027:8.7±1.6 and 8.0±1.4 p\u003d0.020). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, EFT was positively correlated with hypertension and duration of disease and E/e\u0027 (r: 0.10, p: 0.010, r: 0.306, p: 0.004 and r: 0.465 p: 0.007 respectively) and EFT was negatively correlated with E/A (r: -.262 p:0.022).\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report about epicardial adipose tissue in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Epicardial fat thickness as an indicator of cardiovascular involvement was higher in rheumatoid arthritis patients.","title":"Epicardial fat thickness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","pubmedId":"26124795"}
