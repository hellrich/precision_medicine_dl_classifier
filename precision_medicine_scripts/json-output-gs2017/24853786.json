For afatinib, a new second generation irreversible pan-EGFR TKI, no clinical trials in this setting have as yet been performed.\nWe report a patient with a pretreated metastatic NSCLC receiving afatinib in combination with concomitant palliative radiotherapy to the mediastinum and primary lung tumor. The treatment was feasible and well tolerated. The patient achieved a partial response in the irradiated tumor region and the metastatic sites.\nThe combination of afatinib and radiotherapy is promising and should be investigated further. However, because of the limited experience and potential side effects known for other EGFR TKIs, a decision for treatment outside a clinical trial has to be made very carefully, balancing the risk and benefit on an individual patient basis.","title":"Afatinib with concurrent radiotherapy in a patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24853786"}
