The aim of this study was to characterise BRCA2 germ-line mutations in Spanish male breast cancer patients.\nWe screened DNA from 11 affected men and 6 women with breast cancer (BC) who had an affected male relative (father or brother). Exons 2-9 and 12-27 were screened by SSCP, and exons 10 and 11 were screened by PTT. PCR products with a variant band were sequenced.\nThree BRCA2 frameshift mutations were identified (17.6%): the 3374delA in codon 1049 (exon 11), 6857delAA in codon 2010 (exon 11), and 9254delATCAT in codon 3009 (exon 23). These mutations were present in patients with affected first-degree relatives (3 of 9, 33%). The proportion of male patients with a family history of BC in at least one first-degree relative was 53%.\nThere is an association between BRCA2 mutations and male breast cancer, especially in those with a family history of BC. The high prevalence of BRCA2 mutations among males should be considered when estimating risk for female relatives. All new male cases of BC should be regarded as being possibly inherited and should be fully investigated.","title":"BRCA2 germ-line mutations in Spanish male breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"10690392"}
