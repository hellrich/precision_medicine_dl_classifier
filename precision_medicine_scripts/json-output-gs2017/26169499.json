We hypothesized that the insertion of platinum-doublet chemotherapy after the initial response to EGFR-TKIs might prevent the emergence of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs and prolong survival.\nWe carried out a phase II study of the following first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. Gefitinib (250 mg) was administered on days 1-56. Then, after a two-week drug-free period, three cycles of cisplatin (80 mg/m2) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2) were administered on days 71, 92, and 113. Thereafter, gefitinib was re-started on day 134 and continued until disease progression. The primary endpoint was the two-year PFS rate.\nA total of 34 patients were enrolled. Of the 33 eligible patients and 12 achieved a two-year PFS. Thus, this therapeutic strategy met the criterion for usefulness. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year PFS rates were 67.0%, 40.2%, 36.9%, and 22.0%, respectively, and the median PFS was 19.5 months. The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 90.6%, 71.9%, 64.8%, and 36.5% respectively, and the median survival time was 48.0 months.\nThese results indicate that the insertion of platinum-doublet chemotherapy might prevent the development of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations.","title":"Cytotoxic chemotherapy may overcome the development of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) therapy.","pubmedId":"26169499"}
