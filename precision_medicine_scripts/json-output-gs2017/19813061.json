Median follow-up was 4.1 years (range 0-13.3 years) overall, 5.4 years for survivors.\nMSI and KRAS mutation were detected in 12 and 36% of cases, respectively. MSI was more common in early-stage disease (I, 15%; II, 21%; III, 10%; IV, 2%; P \u003d 0.0001). Prevalence of KRAS mutation did not vary with stage (I, 36%; II, 34%; III, 35%; IV, 40%; P \u003d ns). Disease-specific survival was far superior for MSI tumors than for microsatellite stability (MSS) tumors (5-year survival 92 vs. 59%, P \u003c 0.0001). KRAS mutation was a marker of poor survival (5-year survival 55 vs. 68%, P \u003d 0.0002). Using Cox regression analysis MSI, KRAS mutation, and stage were strong independent predictors of survival in the entire patient population. A high-mortality group with MSS/KRAS-mutant tumors was identified within the stage I and II cohort.\nMSI and KRAS mutation provide fundamental genetic signatures influencing tumor behavior across patient subsets and stages of tumor development.","title":"KRAS mutation and microsatellite instability: two genetic markers of early tumor development that influence the prognosis of colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"19813061"}
