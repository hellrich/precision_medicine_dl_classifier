Therefore, accurate assessment of its prevalence and clinical characteristics is increasingly important in the treatment of NSCLC. Also, this ALK rearrangement was previously reported to be more common in patients with no smoking history or those with adenocarcinoma.\nNever-smokers with completely resected pulmonary adenocarcinoma were screened for ALK rearrangements using Nanostring\u0027s gene expression platform. Clinicopathologic data, such as information about epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS mutation status were retrospectively reviewed.\nOf 231 tumors screened, 20 (9%) had an ALK rearrangement and all were confirmed to be positive with immunohistochemical and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Of the tumors with available data on the EGFR/KRAS mutation status, EGFR and KRAS mutation rates were 64% (69/108) and 5% (5/102), respectively. Amongst the tumors that were free of EGFR and KRAS mutations, the proportion of ALK rearrangements reached up to 33%. At the time of data cut-off, total of 68 tumors were recurred. Although the recurrence rate was similar between the ALK-positive and negative groups (30% vs. 29%), there was a tendency for ALK-positive tumors to recur more frequently in the pleural space (15% vs. 5%). The five-year disease-free survival (61%) and overall survival rates (79%) in the ALK-positive group were similar to those in the ALK-negative group (51% and 83%, respectively). Even after excluding two patients treated with crizotinib after disease recurrence, overall survival was similar between the two groups.\nIn an NSCLC subpopulation based on smoking history, histology, and EGFR and KRAS mutation status, the prevalence of ALK rearrangements is considerably high. However, ALK rearrangement status itself has no prognostic relevance in patients with completely resected NSCLC.","title":"Clinical characteristics associated with ALK rearrangements in never-smokers with pulmonary adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24300132"}
