The tumors studied belonged to clinical stages II and III; histologically, the majority of them were moderately to well differentiated. Amplification represented by 5 or more copies was observed for the genes MYCL1, SEA, CCND1, BCL1, and GLI in one case each (2%); HRAS in 2 cases (4%); and ERBB2 in 7 cases (14%). Amplification of ERBB2 ranged from 5 to 68 copies. In addition, 2 tumors with ERBB2 amplification showed additional restriction fragments suggesting possible mutation or rearrangement of the gene. The high incidence of ERBB2 amplification in cervical cancer suggests that this gene may play an important role in tumorigenesis.","title":"ERBB2 (HER2/neu) oncogene is frequently amplified in squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.","pubmedId":"7905784"}
