Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 5 years were significantly higher for patients who met the node-negative criteria (RFS: 96.6%; OS: 95.9%) than for patients who did not (RFS: 75.5%, p\u003c0.0001; OS: 83.1%, p\u003c0.0001). Among patients who met the node-negative criteria, RFS and OS rates at 5 years were not significantly different between those who underwent lobectomy (RFS: 96.0%; OS: 95.9%) and those who underwent sublobar resection (RFS: 97.2%, p\u003d0.94; OS: 95.9%, p\u003d0.98). Of 264 patients with T1b (2-cm to 3-cm) tumors, 106 (40.2%) met the node-negative criteria.\nSublobar resection without systematic nodal dissection is feasible for clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma that meets the above-mentioned node-negative criteria. Even a T1b tumor, which is generally unsuitable for intentional sublobar resection, can be a candidate for sublobar resection if it meets these node-negative criteria.","title":"Sublobar resection for lung adenocarcinoma meeting node-negative criteria on preoperativeÂ imaging.","pubmedId":"24679941"}
