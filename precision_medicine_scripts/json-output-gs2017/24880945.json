Functional studies, molecular characterization of clinical samples, and clinical trials are providing insights into the landscape of resistance mechanisms in this disease. These findings have implications for the development of rational therapeutic approaches, and have identified several challenges that remain to be overcome if outcomes are to be improved in patients with metastatic melanoma.
