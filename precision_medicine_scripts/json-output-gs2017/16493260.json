In this paper, we review clinical and experimental studies in order to evaluate how basic and clinical research in locally advanced breast cancer has progressed in the past year. We focus on four distinct issues: general strategies and natural history; the role of taxanes; trastuzumab in locally advanced breast cancer; and prognostic and predictive factors.\nThis disease requires an aggressive, multimodality approach incorporating chemotherapy and mastectomy; loco-regional radiation is warranted. This should be followed by hormonal intervention for those with oestrogen-receptor-positive disease. In addition, patients with a poor response to primary chemotherapy should receive a non-cross-resistant regimen, but this issue should be further investigated in clinical trials. The addition of a taxane improves the clinical and pathological response compared with an anthracycline-based regimen. The long-term data for disease-free and overall survival are, however, still being collected. The results of ongoing studies will suggest the best schedule, dose and timing of taxanes. Trastuzumab works well as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.\nWe are entering an exciting era in which new technologies, target therapy and classical approaches may improve operability, safety and possibly the disease-free and overall survival of patients with locally advanced breast cancer.","title":"Locally advanced breast cancer.","pubmedId":"16493260"}
