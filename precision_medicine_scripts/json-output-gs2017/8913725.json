We used 46 microsatellite markers that spanned all of the autosomes. Frequent LOH was observed in six chromosomal regions: in chromosome arms lp (32%), 6q (37%), 9p (50%), 12q (30%), 17p (59%), and 18q (35%). Because chromosome arm 12q is a reported target for allelic loss in some other cancers, we focused on this region with 66 primary specimens and identified the minimal common region of allelic loss within a I-cM interval in 12q22-q23.l. Microsatellite instability (MI) was also examined in this study, and the incidence of MI(+) cases, in which MI of two or more microsatellite loci was detected, was 61% (27 of 44 informative cases). In pancreatic tumors with MI(+), mutations of the transforming growth factor beta receptor II (RII) gene were not detected.","title":"Detailed deletion mapping on chromosome arm 12q in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma: identification of a I-cM region of common allelic loss.","pubmedId":"8913725"}
