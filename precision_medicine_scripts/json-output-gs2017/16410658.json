She was found to have hypertension, severe hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Endocrine data revealed elevated plasma levels of ACTH and cortisol with lack of circadian rhythm, non-suppressibility to high-dose dexamethasone, and hyperresponsiveness to CRH stimulation. Although no pituitary mass was detected by MRI of the brain, inferior petrosal sinus sampling showed a step-up of central to peripheral ACTH levels; these data are consistent with the diagnosis of Cushing\u0027s disease. She was successfully treated with metyrapone to control hypercortisolemia. Ten months later, a mass was detected in the ethmoid sinus, which was surgically removed. After resection of the ethmoid sinus tumor, her Cushingoid features and hypercortisolemia disappeared, but recurred after enlargement of a second mass in the maxillary sinus. After resection of the maxillary sinus tumor, her hypercortisolemia subsided. Histologically, the tumor tissues from both the ethmoid and maxillary sinus were identical and consistent with the diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma. Immunohistochemically, the immunoreactivities of ACTH and POMC were positive in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, and immunoreactive ACTH was demonstrated in both tumor tissues. Thus, this is the second rare case with ectopic ACTH syndrome caused by olfactory neuroblastoma thus far reported.","title":"Olfactory neuroblastoma causing ectopic ACTH syndrome.","pubmedId":"16410658"}
