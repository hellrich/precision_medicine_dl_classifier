It is also considered to be superior in terms of medical economics. In recent years, the development of individualized treatment in non-small cell lung cancer is remarkable, also the usefulness of biomarkers has been well proven. Among the biomarkers of oral anti-cancer agents, thymindylate synthase (TS) expression is related to 5-FU-based anti-tumor agent, and EGFR to TKI-based anti-tumor agent, in addition to the effectiveness of the c-Met-overexpressing in lung cancer has been evolved and phase III clinical trial of oral c-Met inhibitors have been reported. In oral therapeutic agents in lung adenocarcinoma, TS expression, EGFR mutation and c-Met expression was examined and its clinical significance will be applied to the future individualized therapy. Methods: For the tumors from 71 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery in our department, the intratumoral expression of TS and c-Met were evaluated with immunohistochemical staining. The status of EGFR mutations was examined by direct sequence method using extracted DNA from tumors. Results: (1) In the group observed the effect of corresponding therapeutic agent, TS negative was 40 cases (56.3%), EGFR mutant 23 was cases (32.3%), c-Met strongly positive was 17 cases (23.9%). (2) TS, c-Met expression, EGFR mutations, were proved to be the independent predictor for correspounding anti-cancer drug, and there were no significant correlation among these three biomarkers was abserved. (3) TS-negative or EGFR mutant-type was 49/71 (69.0%). Also in the TS-positive and EGFR wild-type, c-Met strongly positive example 5 cases (5/22 cases, 22.7%) was observed. It was considered to be the target of administration, if c-Met inhibitors is commercialized in the future. (4) The possible cases of individualized chemotherapy with oral therapeutic agents was 54/71 cases (76.1%). Conclusions: Three biomarkers in lung adenocarcinoma (TS, EGFR, c-Met) is respectively independent, the possibility of individualized treatment with oral agents based on biomarker analysis has been suggested.","title":"Correlation among the biomarkers for oral anti-cancer agents in lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_169416-176"}
