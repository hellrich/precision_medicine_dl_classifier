Enteritidis, SE) circulating in Thailand, we characterised clinical isolates obtained during 2004-2007.\nAntimicrobial resistance profiles, multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) types and 3 representative virulence determinants (spvA, sodCI and sopE) were established from SE isolates (n \u003d 192) collected from stool and blood of patients throughout Thailand during the period 2004-2007.\nResistance was found in SE against 10 out of 11 antimicrobials studied. The highest resistance ratios were observed for nalidixic acid (83.2%), ciprofloxacin (51.1%) and ampicillin (50.5%), and 25.5% were multidrug resistant. Based on five polymorphic tandem repeat loci analysis, MLVA identified 20 distinct types with three closely related predominant types. A significant increase of AMP resistance from 2004 to 2006 was strongly correlated with that of a MLVA type, 5-5-11-7-3.\nThe usage of antimicrobials in human medicine or farm settings might act as selective pressures and cause the spread of resistant strains. Hence, a strict policy on antimicrobial usage needs to be implemented to achieve the control of resistant SE in Thailand.","title":"Genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance pattern of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis clinical isolates in Thailand.","pubmedId":"26860961"}
