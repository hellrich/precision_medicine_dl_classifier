Vitreous taps were extracted from the central vitreous body and plasminogen was functionally determined in an innovative, ultrasensitive p-nitroanilide reaction after activation with streptokinase (100% of normal, %N \u003d functional plasminogen in pooled normal citrated plasma). Intravitreal VEGF levels were assayed to estimate BRB breakdown.\nIntravitreal functional plasminogen was detected in all analyzed samples (n \u003d 30) and mean (±SD) plasminogen activities were found to be 0.97 ± 1.06%N (range: 0.03-3.9%N). Patients suffering from BRVO exhibited significantly higher intravitreal plasminogen (1.35 ± 1.11%N) in comparison with controls (0.20 ± 0.21%N, p \u003c 0.001). Intravitreal VEGF concentrations in the BRVO group (576 ± 547 pg/ml) were significantly higher than these in controls (111 ± 120 pg/ml, p \u003d 0.003). There was a significant correlation between intravitreal functional plasminogen and intravitreal VEGF levels (r \u003d 0.519, p \u003d 0.003).\nIntravitreal functional plasminogen is significantly elevated in eyes suffering from BRVO and correlates with the extent of BRB breakdown. The induction of posterior vitreous detachment by using intravitreally administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (enzymatic vitreolysis) should be explored in further investigations.","title":"Intravitreal functional plasminogen in eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion.","pubmedId":"25059575"}
