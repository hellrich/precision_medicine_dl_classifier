In contrast, primary glioblastomas very rarely contain IDH1 mutations, although primary and secondary glioblastomas are histologically indistinguishable. The IDH1 mutations are remarkably specific to a single codon in the conserved and functionally important Arg132 in IDH1. In gliomas, the most frequent IDH1 mutations (\u003e90%) were G395A (R132H). In this study, we immunized mice with R132H-containing IDH1 (IDH1(R132H)) peptide. After cell fusion using Sendai virus envelope, the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which specifically reacted with IDH1(R132H), were screened in ELISA. One of the mAbs, IMab-1 reacted with the IDH1(R132H) peptide, but not with wild type IDH1 (IDH1(wt)) peptide in ELISA. In Western-blot analysis, IMab-1 reacted with only the IDH1(R132H) protein, not IDH1(wt) protein or the other IDH1 mutants, indicating that IMab-1 is IDH1(R132H)-specific. Furthermore, IMab-1 specifically stained the IDH1(R132H)-expressing cells in astrocytomas in immunohistochemistry, whereas it did not react with IDH1(R132H)-negative primary glioblastoma sections. In conclusion, we established an anti-IDH1(R132H)-specific monoclonal antibody IMab-1, which should be significantly useful for diagnosis and biological evaluation of mutation-bearing gliomas.","title":"A monoclonal antibody IMab-1 specifically recognizes IDH1R132H, the most common glioma-derived mutation.","pubmedId":"19818334"}
