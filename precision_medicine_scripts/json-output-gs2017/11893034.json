The comparative incidence and significance of HER-2/neu gene amplification for lobular and ductal breast cancer have not been previously characterized.\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary breast cancer tissue sections from 71 women diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma were tested for HER-2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method using the Ventana unique sequence probe (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). A series of 106 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma was similarly processed and tested. Lymph node status was available for 155 (88%) of the 177 cases and 82 (46%) were lymph node-negative (LN-) and 73 (41%) were lymph node-positive (LN+). Patients were treated for a mean of 65 months (range 1-169 months).\n9 of 71 (13%) cases of lobular cancer featured HER-2/neu gene amplification, whereas 51 (48%) of 106 cases of ductal cancer showed amplification (P \u003c 0.0001). On univariate analysis of combined lobular and ductal cases, HER-2/neu gene amplification detected by FISH predicted disease-related death (P \u003c 0.0001). HER-2/neu gene amplification also predicted disease-related death in lobular cases alone (P \u003d 0.003), LN+ lobular cases separately (P \u003d 0.019), and LN- and LN+ ductal cases separately and alone (P \u003c 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of the lobular group alone revealed that LN+ status (P \u003d 0.015) and stage (P \u003d 0.01) were independent predictors of disease-related death, and HER-2/neu gene amplification reached near significance (P \u003d 0.086). In the ductal carcinoma group alone, HER-2/neu gene amplification (P \u003d 0.03), lymph node status (P \u003d 0.0001), tumor stage (P \u003d 0.0001), and tumor grade (P \u003d 0.044) were independent predictors of overall disease survival.\nHER-2/neu gene amplification detected by FISH was identified at a significantly lower rate in lobular compared with ductal breast cancer. HER-2/neu gene amplification when present in lobular breast cancer is a significant adverse prognostic factor.","title":"Comparison of HER-2/neu oncogene amplification detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization in lobular and ductal breast cancer.","pubmedId":"11893034"}
