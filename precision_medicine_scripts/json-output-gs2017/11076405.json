He was hospitalized several times because of hepatic encephalopathy. He underwent liver transplantation for a clinical diagnosis of Child\u0027s C cirrhosis complicated by hepatopulmonary syndrome. The explanted liver, however, was not cirrhotic and demonstrated features of hepatoportal sclerosis. Although treatment for hepatoportal sclerosis is relief of portal hypertension; in rare cases such as in this patient with liver failure, liver transplantation is indicated.","title":"Portal hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome in a middle-aged man with hepatitis B infection.","pubmedId":"11076405"}
