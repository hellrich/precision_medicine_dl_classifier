Although GC mainly affects older patients, fewer than 10% of GC patients are considered early-onset (EOGC) (presenting at the age of 45 years or younger). These EOGC show different clinicopathological and molecular profiles compared to late onset GC suggesting that they represent a separate entity within gastric carcinogenesis. In light of potential trastuzumab benefit, subpopulations of GC such as EOGC (versus late onset) should be evaluated for their frequency of amplification and overexpression using currently available techniques.\nTissue microarray (TMA) blocks of 108 early onset GC and 91 late onset GC were stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC, Hercep test, DAKO) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH, SPoT-Light, Invitrogen).\nOverall, we found only 5% HER2 high level amplification and 3% HER2 3+ overexpression (6/199). In addition, 8 patients (4%) showed a low level CISH amplification and 9 patients (4.5%) showed a 2+ IHC score. IHC and CISH showed 92% concordance and CISH showed less heterogeneity than IHC. In 2/199 cases (1%), IHC showed clinically relevant heterogeneity between TMA cores, but all cases with focal IHC 3+ expression were uniformly CISH high level amplified. Early onset GCs showed a significantly lower frequency of HER2 amplification (2%) and overexpression (0%) than late onset GCs (8% and 7% respectively) (p\u003d0.085 and p\u003d0.008 respectively). Proximal GC had more HER2 amplification (9% versus 3%) and overexpression (7% versus 2%) than distal tumours although this difference was not significant (p\u003d0.181 and p\u003d0.182 respectively). HER2 CISH showed more high level amplification in the intestinal type (7%, 16% if low-level included) compared to the mixed (5%, 5% if low-level included) and diffuse type (3%, 4% if low-level included) GCs (p\u003d0.029). A similar association was seen for HER2 IHC and histologic type (p\u003d0.008). Logistic regression indicated a significant association between HER2 expression and age, which remained significant when adjusted for both location and histological type.\nEven focal HER2 overexpression in GC points to uniform HER2 amplification by CISH. We show for the first time that early onset GC has a lower frequency of HER2 amplification and overexpression than late onset GC, and confirm that intestinal type GC shows the highest rate of HER2 amplification and overexpression.","title":"Low frequency of HER2 amplification and overexpression in early onset gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"21394646"}
