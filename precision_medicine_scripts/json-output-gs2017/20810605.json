Monoclonal antibody PAM4 is reactive with a unique biomarker expressed by \u003e85% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In this report, we examined the ability of a PAM4-based immunoassay to detect early-stage disease.\nThe PAM4-based immunoassay was used to quantitate antigen in the serum of healthy volunteers (n \u003d 19), patients with known pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 68), and patients with a primary diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (n \u003d 29).\nSensitivity for detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma was 82%, with a false-positive rate of 5% for healthy controls. Patients with advanced disease had significantly higher antigen levels than those with early-stage disease (P \u003c 0.01), with a diagnostic sensitivity of 91%, 86%, and 62% for stage 3/stage 4 advanced disease, stage 2, and stage 1, respectively. We also evaluated chronic pancreatitis sera, finding 38% positive for antigen; however, this was discordant with immunohistochemical findings that suggest the PAM4 antigen is not produced by inflamed pancreatic tissue. Furthermore, several of the serum-positive pancreatitis patients, for whom tissue specimens were available for pathologic interpretation, had evidence of neoplastic precursor lesions.\nThese results suggest the use of the PAM4 serum assay to detect early-stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma and that positive levels of PAM4 antigen are not derived from inflamed pancreatic tissues but rather may provide evidence of subclinical pancreatic neoplasia. EFFECT: The ability to detect pancreatic adenocarcinoma at an early stage could provide for early therapeutic intervention with potentially improved patient outcomes.","title":"Detection of early-stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20810605"}
