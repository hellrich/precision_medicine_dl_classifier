Complicating this is the extreme diversity, heterogeneity, and rarity of these neoplasms. Few therapeutic options exist for relapsed and refractory sarcomas. In clinical practice many oncologists refer patients for genomic profiling hoping for guidance on treatment options after standard therapy. We analyzed clinical next generation exome sequencing (NGS) results in patients with advanced sarcomas to discover potentially actionable aberrations and their frequency in a clinical setting. Methods: We reviewed charts of patients with advanced sarcoma referred to investigational cancer therapeutics department and had CLIA certified comprehensive genomic profiling of 200- 315 cancer genes in at least 50ng of DNA. Actionable aberrations were defined as those identifying anti-cancer drugs on the market, in registered clinical trials, or in the Drug-Gene Interaction Database. Results: Among the 98 patients analyzed median age was 33.5 years (range 10-76), M: F ratio 47:51. Common sarcoma types were de-differentiated lipo (N \u003d 20; 20%), leiomyo (n \u003d 11; 11%), osteo (n \u003d 9; 9%), well-differentiated lipo (n \u003d 7; 7%), rhabdomyo (n \u003d 6; 6%), carcino, GIST, spindle cell, and unclassified (N \u003d 5 each; 5%). Seventy percent (69/98) of patients had \u003e 1 potentially actionable genomic aberration. The most common aberrations involved CDK4 amplification (n \u003d 22; 22%), CDKN2A/B loss or mutation (n \u003d 16; 16 %), and MDM2 amplification (n \u003d 21; 21%, non-liposarcoma \u003d 4),. Other notably targetable mutations occurring more rarely included PIK3CA, NOTCH2, NTRK1/3, KDR and PDGFR. Novel fusions were characterized (KIAA1549:BRAF and DCTN1-ALK) that molecularly matched to therapy with patient benefit. Interesting cases included a patient with 3 EWS rearrangements (EWSR1-FLI1, CENPP-EWSR1, ETS1-EWSR1) and re-classification of an unclassified sarcoma to Ewings. Conclusions: Incorporating NGS into sarcoma management may allow for more precise diagnosis and sub-classification of this diverse and rare disease. Matching patients to inhibitors targeting CDK, MDM2, PIK3CA, NOTCH2, and NTRK available in basket clinical trials are opportunities for translation of biology into clinical benefit.","title":"Clinical next-generation sequencing in sarcomas.","pubmedId":"ASCO_166807-176"}
