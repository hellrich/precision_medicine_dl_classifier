We have analyzed EGFR and HER2 mutations and the expression of the two products of the CDKN2A gene (p14(arf) and p16(INK4a)) in 116 NSCLC that have been previously analyzed for TP53 and KRAS mutations in relation to smoking history of patients. EGFR mutations were detected in 20 of 116 (17%) tumors, whereas five (4.3%) tumors contained HER2 mutations. No tumor contained both mutations. Of tumors with EGFR or HER2 mutation, 72% were adenocarcinomas, 68% were from never smokers, and 32% were from former smokers. EGFR but not HER2 mutations were mutually exclusive with KRAS mutation. Among never smokers, 11 of 16 tumors with EGFR mutation also had TP53 mutation, in contrast with two of 17 tumors without EGFR mutation (P \u003d 0.0008). Expression of p14(arf), but not p16(ink4a), was more frequently down-regulated in never smokers (62.5%) than ever smokers (35%; P \u003d 0.008). All tumors with EGFR or HER2 mutations and wild-type TP53 showed down-regulation of p14(arf) expression. These observations suggest that functional inactivation of the p14(arf)/p53 connection is required in tumors with EGFR or HER2 mutations, consistent with the notion that these proteins are part of a fail-safe mechanism protecting cells against untimely or excessive mitotic signals.","title":"Patterns of EGFR, HER2, TP53, and KRAS mutations of p14arf expression in non-small cell lung cancers in relation to smoking history.","pubmedId":"17575133"}
