In effect little more than two hundred cases are described in literature. Natural history of this tumour is characterized by high local recurrence rate although hematogenic and lymphatic spread is usually a late event and involves high-grade tumours. The clinical diagnosis of spermatic cord liposarcoma can be difficult particularly for non expert surgeons, and is often mistaken for different diagnoses. Radical orchiectomy with high cord ligation is the treatment of choice to prevent local recurrence. Otherwise than commonly advised, the treatment is suitable to be performed under local anaesthesia and the patient easily and safely discharged few hours after surgery.","title":"Outpatient treatment for liposarcoma of the spermatic cord.","pubmedId":"22699301"}
