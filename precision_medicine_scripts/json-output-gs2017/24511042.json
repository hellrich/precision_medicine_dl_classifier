Karnofsky status was between 50 and 80. Life expectancy was estimated to be between 2 and 6 months. Ten consecutive patients with chemoresistant advanced metastatic cancer were offered compassionate metabolic treatment. They were treated with a combination of lipoic acid at 600 mg i.v. (Thioctacid), hydroxycitrate at 500 mg t.i.d. (Solgar) and low-dose naltrexone at 5 mg (Revia) at bedtime. Primary sites were lung carcinoma (n\u003d2), colonic carcinoma (n\u003d2), ovarian carcinoma (n\u003d1), esophageal carcinoma (n\u003d1), uterine sarcoma (n\u003d1), cholangiocarcinoma (n\u003d1), parotid carcinoma (n\u003d1) and unknown primary (n\u003d1). The patients had been heavily pre-treated. One patient had received four lines of chemotherapy, four patients three lines, four patients two lines and one patient had received radiation therapy and chemotherapy. An eleventh patient with advanced prostate cancer resistant to hormonotherapy treated with hydroxycitrate, lipoic acid and anti-androgen is also reported.\nOne patient was unable to receive i.v. lipoic acid and was switched to oral lipoic acid (Tiobec). Toxicity was limited to transient nausea and vomiting. Two patients died of progressive disease within two months. Two other patients had to be switched to conventional chemotherapy combined with metabolic treatment, one of when had a subsequent dramatic tumor response. Disease in the other patients was either stable or very slowly progressive. The patient with hormone-resistant prostate cancer had a dramatic fall in Prostate-Specific Antigen (90%), which is still decreasing.\nThese very primary results suggest the lack of toxicity and the probable efficacy of metabolic treatment in chemoresistant advanced carcinoma. It is also probable that metabolic treatment enhances the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy. These results are in line with published animal data. A randomized clinical trial is warranted.","title":"Metabolic treatment of cancer: intermediate results of a prospective case series.","pubmedId":"24511042"}
