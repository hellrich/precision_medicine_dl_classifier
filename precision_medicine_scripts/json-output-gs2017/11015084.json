Therefore, we examined the role of p21(WAF1) and p53 in the determination of outcome for patients who receive radiation and/or chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.\np21(WAF1) and p53 protein expression were determined (with the use of immunohistochemistry) in specimens from 90 patients with pancreatic cancer. Forty-four patients underwent surgical resection, and 46 patients had either locally unresectable tumors (n \u003d 9 patients) or distant metastases (n \u003d 37 patients). Seventy-three percent of the patients who underwent resection and 63% of the patients who did not undergo resection received radiation and/or chemotherapy.\np21(WAF1) expression was present in 48 of 86 tumors (56%) and was significantly (P\u003c.05) associated with advanced tumor stage. Median survival among patients with resected pancreatic cancer who received adjuvant chemoradiation with p21(WAF1)-positive tumors was significantly longer than in patients with no p21(WAF1) staining (25 vs. 11 months; P \u003d .01). Fifty of 89 tumors (56%) stained positive for p53 protein. p53 overexpression was associated with decreased survival in patients who did not undergo resection.\nNormal p21(WAF1) expression may be necessary for a beneficial response to current adjuvant chemoradiation protocols for pancreatic cancer. Alternate strategies for adjuvant therapy should be explored for patients with pancreatic cancer who lack functional p21(WAF1).","title":"p21WAF1 expression is associated with improved survival after adjuvant chemoradiation for pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"11015084"}
