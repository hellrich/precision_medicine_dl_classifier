Lung inflammation with resultant protein citrullination may trigger anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, inflammation, and arthritis. Alternatively, lung and joint inflammation may be two manifestations of a single underlying pathology. The lung has increased citrullination and TNF-α levels are high in rheumatoid arthritis; however, it is unknown if TNF-α can induce lung protein citrullination. The citrullinating enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) exacerbates TNF-α-induced arthritis, but a role for PAD4 in lung citrullination and TNF-α-induced lung inflammation has not been explored. Our aim was to use TNF-α-overexpressing mice to clarify the intersection of TNF-α, citrullination, PAD4, arthritis, and lung inflammation.\nLung protein citrullination in wild-type mice, mice that overexpress TNF-α systemically (TNF(+)), TNF(+)PAD4(+/+), and TNF(+)PAD4(-/-) mice was quantified by both gel electrophoresis using a citrulline probe and western blot. Hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E)-stained lung sections from TNF(+)PAD4(+/+) and TNF(+)PAD4(-/-) mice were scored for lung inflammation. H\u0026E-stained ankle joint sections from mice that overexpress TNF-α only in the lungs were assessed for arthritis.\nTNF(+) mice have increased lung protein citrullination. TNF(+)PAD4(-/-) mice do not have significantly reduced lung protein citrullination, but do have decreased lung inflammation compared to TNF(+)PAD4(+/+) mice. Mice that overexpress TNF-α only in the lungs do not develop arthritis.\nPAD4 exacerbates lung inflammation downstream of TNF-α without having a major role in generalized protein citrullination in inflamed lungs. Also, TNF-α-induced lung inflammation is not sufficient to drive murine arthritis.","title":"Tumor necrosis factor alpha, citrullination, and peptidylarginine deiminase 4 in lung and joint inflammation.","pubmedId":"27450561"}
