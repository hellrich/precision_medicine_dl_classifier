This rare form of meningioma is a potential source of confusion with other myxoid neoplasms such as metastatic adenocarcinoma or chordoma. In addition to the usual stigmata of meningial cell differentiation, ultrastructural examination revealed spaces delineated by a network of cellular processes and enclosing loose granular and fibrillar material. This neoplasm is probably linked to the so-called microcystic meningioma but has an overt production of acid mucosubstance.","title":"Myxoid meningioma.","pubmedId":"2382312"}
