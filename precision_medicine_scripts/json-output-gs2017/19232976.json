It is generally associated with a poor prognosis, and approximately 85% of cases are misdiagnosed initially. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient presenting with a rapidly growing mass localized to the hallux, which eventually resulted in the diagnosis of an ulcerated amelanotic subungual melanoma. Because of their lack of pigmentation, amelanotic melanoma is frequently misdiagnosed for other more common forms of cutaneous compromise, and a delay in proper treatment because of failure to make the diagnosis can greatly decrease the likelihood of a favorable outcome.\n4.","title":"Amelanotic subungual melanoma: a case report.","pubmedId":"19232976"}
