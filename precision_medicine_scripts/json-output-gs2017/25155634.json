Ras-dependent hyperactive signaling is commonly associated with tumorigenesis, invasion, EMT, and metastasis. However, the downstream effectors by which Ras regulates EMT remain ill defined. In this study, we show that the H-Ras pathway leads to mesenchymal-like phenotypic changes in human breast epithelial cells by controlling the ZEB1/microRNA-200c axis. Moreover, H-Ras suppresses the expression of the discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a collagen receptor tyrosine kinase, via ZEB1, thus identifying ZEB1 as a novel transcriptional repressor of DDR1. Mutation studies on the putative promoter of the DDR1 gene revealed that bipartite Z- and E-box elements play a key role in transcriptional repression of DDR1 in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell lines by ZEB1. Furthermore, we found an inverse correlation between ZEB1 and DDR1 expression in various cancer cell lines and in human breast carcinoma tissues. Consistently, overexpression of DDR1 reduced the invasive phenotype of mesenchymal-like triple-negative breast cancer cells in 3D cultures and in vivo. Thus, ZEB1\u0027s role in maintenance of EMT in breast carcinoma cells is mediated in part by its ability to suppress DDR1 expression and consequently contribute to the activation of the invasive phenotype. Taken together, our results unveil a novel H-Ras/ZEB1/DDR1 network that contributes to breast cancer progression in triple-negative breast cancers.
