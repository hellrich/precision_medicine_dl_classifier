In this study, we assessed the survival, clinical status, and toxicity of this multidrug regimen in chemotherapy-pretreated patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and low PS.\nPatients with stage IIIB or IV lung adenocarcinoma, who had progressed after prior standard chemotherapy, and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS \u003e or \u003d 2, received a daily combination of somatostatin, retinoids, melatonin, vitamin D, bromocriptine, and cyclophosphamide.\nTwenty-three (23) patients were enrolled. The median age was 59 years (range, 42-75). The PS was 2 and 3 in 73.9% and 26.1% of patients, respectively. The median overall survival (intent-to-treat analysis) was 95 days (range, 19-214). The side-effects were mild, mostly consisting of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and drowsiness of Grade 1-2. There was an improvement in both respiratory and general symptoms, which was more evident in patients surviving more than 95 days.\nThe combined regimen of somatostatin, retinoids, melatonin, vitamin D, bromocriptine, and cyclophosphamide is well tolerated and can improve disease-related symptoms in heavily pretreated patients with late-stage lung adenocarcinoma and poor PS.","title":"Somatostatin, retinoids, melatonin, vitamin D, bromocriptine, and cyclophosphamide in chemotherapy-pretreated patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and low performance status.","pubmedId":"17627413"}
