IL-2 gene was transfected into three human melanoma cell lines; secretion of IL-2 from stable transfected cells was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The PBL response to these melanoma cells was then examined in a mixed-lymphocyte tumor reaction using PBLs from eight melanoma patients. The PBL response to autologous (P \u003c 0.01) or human leukocyte antigen A cross-reactive (P \u003c 0.05) transfected melanoma cells was significantly higher than it was to nontransfected melanoma cells. These data suggest that IL-2 gene transfection may be an important strategic approach to enhancing specific immune responses induced by a polyvalent melanoma cell vaccine.","title":"Transfection of interleukin 2 gene into human melanoma cells augments cellular immune response.","pubmedId":"8439968"}
