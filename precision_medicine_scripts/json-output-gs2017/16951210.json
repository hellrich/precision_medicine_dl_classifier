We proposed to define the prevalence of the two telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMM), to assess their association with histology, and to compare their prognostic relevance in a series of 93 patients with liposarcoma. ALT was detected by assaying ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and TA was assayed using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol. ALT or TA was found in 25.9% or 26.6% of 139 tested liposarcoma lesions, respectively. Three lesions were ALT+/TA+ whereas approximately 50% of lesions did not show any known TMM. TMM phenotype was consistent during disease progression. ALT was prevalent in dedifferentiated and in grade 3 liposarcomas whereas TA prevailed in most round-cell myxoid and in grade 2 liposarcomas. ALT and TA incidence was similar in primary and recurrent lesions whereas metastases were more frequently TA+ than ALT+ (59% versus 18%; P \u003d 0.04). TMM presence negatively affected patient prognosis (P \u003d 0.001): increased mortality was associated with positivity for TA (P \u003d 0.038) or ALT (P \u003c 0.0001) compared with TMM absence. ALT proved to be a stronger prognostic discriminant of increased mortality than TA even when adjusted for tumor location, grade, and histology (hazard ratio for cause-specific death, 3.58 versus 1.15). Our results indicate that ALT can support fully malignant liposarcomas and is associated with unfavorable disease outcome.","title":"Telomere maintenance mechanisms in liposarcomas: association with histologic subtypes and disease progression.","pubmedId":"16951210"}
