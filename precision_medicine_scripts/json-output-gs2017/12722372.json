The average age of patients with vulvar cancer is 60 years, and most cases occur between 70-80. The great majority of cases (95%) belong to squamous cell carcinoma with endophytic or exophytic growth, for example carcinoma verrucosum. It is malignant neoplasms showing a significant histologic maturity, which however, does not cause metastases.\nThis is a case report concerning a 101 year old patient with vulvar cancer treated surgically.\nIn cases of vulvar cancer, surgical treatment is still the method of choice. The surgical removal of the tumor together with the surrounding tissues proved to be sufficient.","title":"[Surgical treatment of vulvar cancer in 101-year old patient--a case report].","pubmedId":"12722372"}
