It is unknown whether BRAF mt CRC have molecular and biological profiles similar to BRAF mutant melanomas (Mel). Methods: A total of 5139 tumor samples (CRC, 4007 and Mel, 1132) submitted to Caris Life Sciences for IHC (protein expression), ISH (gene amplification), and NGS sequencing between 2009 and 2015 were retrospectively studied. Chi-square tests determined differences. Results: The rate of BRAF-V600E mutation was 7% in CRC (n \u003d 270), and 30% in Mel (n \u003d 334). Most frequently co-mutated genes in BRAF mt CRC were TP53 (56%), APC (26%), and PIK3CA (19%), and most frequently overexpressed proteins were TOP2A (90%), EGFR (77%), and cMET (57%). Most frequently co-mutated genes in BRAF mt Mel were CDKN2A (28%), ROS1 (19%), and TP53 (13%), and most frequently overexpressed proteins were PD1+ TILs (75%), and TS (71%). When compared with BRAF mt Mel, BRAF mt CRCs had a greater frequency of TP53 (56% vs. 13%), APC (26% vs. 3%), PIK3CA (19% vs. 1%), and SMAD4 (18% vs. 0%) mutations (all p-values \u003c 0.01); however, mutations in CDKN2A (28% vs. 19%) and ROS1 (19% vs. 12%) appeared at higher rates in mt Mel (statistical significance not reached). BRAF mt CRC had a higher frequency of P-glycoprotein (PGP) (52% vs. 9%), cMET (57% vs. 13%), EGFR (77% vs. 6%), and HER2 (4% vs. 0%) overexpression (all p-values \u003c 0.001), but lower PD1+ TILs (61% vs. 75%; p \u003d 0.012) and ERCC1 (17% vs. 41%; p \u003d 0.004) when compared with mt Mel. Co-occurring RAS mutations were rare, seen in 3 CRC and 2 Mel pts. MEK1 (1/31) and MEK2 (1/31) mutations were detected only in Mel. Mismatch repair deficiency and MSI were seen in 34% of BRAF mt CRC. On examining PD1+ TILs and PDL1 tumor expression in MSI-high (H) and MSIstable (S) CRC, and comparing with Mel, PD1+ TILs were found in 75% of Mel, 80% of MSI-H CRC, and 56% of MSI-S CRC (Mel or MSI-H CRC vs. MSI-S CRC; p \u003c 0.01). PDL1 was positive in 10% of MSI-H and 15.8% of MSI-S CRC and 15% of Mel. Conclusions:BRAF mt CRCmay carry molecular alterations that are distinct from BRAF mt Mel, suggesting different carcinogenic pathways, and potential resistance mechanisms. Drug combinations that target these alterations (e.g., cMET, EGFR) may warrant further investigation.","title":"Comparative molecular analyses of BRAF-V600E mutant tumors: Colorectal cancers (CRC) vs. melanomas.","pubmedId":"ASCO_169294-176"}
