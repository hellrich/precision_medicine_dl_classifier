At present, surgical resection remains the only potential curative treatment for PDAC. However, only 15-20% of patients with PDAC are eligible for lesion resection. Total pancreatectomy (TP) and superior mesenteric-portal vein resection (SMPVR) may increase the rate of resection of PDCA, but the effect of this approach on improving long-term patient outcomes remains controversial. The present study investigated a case of PDAC in the pancreatic neck of a male patient. The patient underwent a TP, combined with SMPVR, for a margin-negative resection. Following an uneventful post-operative recovery, the patient received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The patient is currently alive at six years post-surgery, with a high quality of life. Given the clinical outcome of this patient, TP combined with SMPVR may provide PDAC patients with an opportunity for long-term survival. Therefore, patients with PDAC that is believed to be unresectable based on pre-operative assessment, may benefit from TP and SMPVR.","title":"Long-term survival following total pancreatectomy and superior mesenteric-portal vein resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: A case report.","pubmedId":"25435983"}
