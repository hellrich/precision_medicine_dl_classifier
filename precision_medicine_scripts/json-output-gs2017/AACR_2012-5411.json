PMN-MDSC is the predominant subset of MDSC that accumulates in spleen, bone marrow, blood, and tumor tissues in various mouse tumor models. M-MDSC produced higher level of cytokines and chemokines including G-CSF, IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, MCP-1 and RANTES compared to PMN-MDSC. The current paradigm considers PMN-MDSC and M-MDSC to differentiate from different progenitors alongside different lineages (granulocytic and monocytic, respectively). M-MDSC differentiate into dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas PMN-MDSC are terminally differentiated cells. Our study demonstrated that in cancer M-MDSC represent highly proliferative population of cells that differentiate not only to DC and macrophages but also to PMN-MDSC. The retinoblastoma gene (Rb1), a central regulator of the cell cycle and cell differentiation, is known to be involved in monocytic and granulocytic lineage commitment. When examining Rb1 levels in freshly isolated cells, M-MDSC expressed high levels of Rb1 similar to those in dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils isolated from nave mice. In sharp contrast, PMN-MDSC had undetectable Rb1. Lack of Rb1 in mice with conditional deletion of the gene promoted an expansion of splenic CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clo cells, similar to the phenotype of PMN-MDSC in tumor-bearing mice. Lack of Rb1 in PMN-MDSC was caused by transcriptional repression of the gene. In culture with GM-CSF, Rb1 expression in M-MDSC remained the same while in PMN-MDSC it was increased over time to the level seen in control neutrophils. Inhibition of rb1 expression in PMN-MDSC correlated with the level of histone acetylation of rb1 promoter. Treatment of PMN-MDSC with inhibitors of histone deacetilases (HDAC) resulted in the increase in rb1 expression suggesting that it may be controlled by histone modification. HDAC inhibitors abrogated differentiation of M-MDSC to PMN-MDSC in the presence of tumor explants conditioned medium. These results suggest that down-regulation of Rb1 plays a major role in accumulation of MDSC in cancer by regulating PMN-MDSC differentiation from M-MDSC. HDAC may be considered as potential targets for therapeutic regulation of MDSC.","title":"Rb1 controls the differentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells subsets","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-5411"}
