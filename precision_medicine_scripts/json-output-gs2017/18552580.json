Herein, we present a 54-year-old man with a dilated cardiomyopathy who was hospitalized because of his CHF, which included bilateral pleural effusions, right hydrothorax greater than left. The pathophysiology of pleural fluid formation in CHF, previously debated, has now reached consensus, albeit not frequently reviewed. This index case offers such an opportunity.","title":"Bilateral pleural effusions in congestive heart failure.","pubmedId":"18552580"}
