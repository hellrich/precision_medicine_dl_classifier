The present study focus on the significance of EGFR mutations combined with HER2 overexpression on survival outcomes in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer patients in Uygur population.\nA total of 111 consecutive Uygurods: A total of 111 consecutive Cell Lung Cancer under went lung Cell Lung biopsy or surgery at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xin Jiang Medical University between March 2009 and January 2013 were included in this retrospective study. All the patients included had received gefitinib 250 mg once daily. The HER2 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining with score of membranous staining being 0 \u003d none, 1 \u003d weak, 2 \u003d 10-30% cells, 3≥30% cells stained, and Real-time PCR techniques were conducted to detect mutations of EGFR through 21 kinds of human EGFR gene mutation detection kits. A retrospective review of the medical records was analyzed to determine the correlation between the presence of EGFR mutations combined with HER2 overexpression and clinicopathological factors.\nThe overall rate of EGFR mutation was 10.81% (n \u003d 12), which mainly involved exons 19 (83.33%, n \u003d 10), 21 (16.67%, n \u003d 2). The overall rate of HER2 overexpression was 21.62% (n \u003d 24). EGFR mutation combined with HER2 overexpression analysis was performed in 111 patients, with an overall rate of 5.41% (n \u003d 6). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly longer in the EGFR mutations group than in the wild type group (PFS: 10.0±1.5 versus 3.8±1.4 months, P \u003d 0.000; OS: 27.3±2.9 versus 19.1±4.7 months, P \u003d 0.000). The ORR in patients with HER2 overexpression was 29.17%, and 13.80% in those patients with HER2 negative, but no significant difference (P \u003d 0.121). The median PFS and OS in HER2 positive group showed no significant difference compared with HER2 negative group (PFS: 4.7±1.2 months versus 3.9±1.6 months, P \u003d 0.085; OS: 20.5±2.4 versus 19.2±2.6 months, P \u003d 0.094). As regarding to ORR, PFS and OS, EGFR mutations combined with HER2 overexpression patients showed no superior efficacy to gefitinib treatment compared with EGFR mutations combined with HER2 negative.\nIn Uygur population, progression-free survivals were improved in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR mutations. HER2 overexpression provided a poor prognostic factor in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.","title":"Assessment and prognostic analysis of EGFR mutations or/and HER2 overexpression in Uygur\u0027s Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.","pubmedId":"26885207"}
