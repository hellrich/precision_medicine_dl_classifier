The mRNA expression of TIMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, PTEN, VEGF and Flk-1 were examined by RT-PCR. In each group, the expression of PTEN, VEGF and Flk-1 were also detected using an indirect immunofluorescence assay.\nCompared with non-transfected cells and cells transfected with the empty vector, sense TIMP-1-transfected cells showed obviously upregulated PTEN expression (P\u003c0.05) and significantly lowered gelatinase activity (P\u003c0.05) and VEGF and Flk-1 expressions (P\u003c0.05). Transfection with the antisense TIMP-1 plasmid produced the reverse results (P\u003c0.05). MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor III did not obviously affected the expression of PTEN, VEGF or Flk-1 as compared with the non-transfected or empty vector-transfected cells.\nIn the aging progress, the renal tissues express high levels of TIMP-1 to upregulate PTEN expression via a MMP-independent pathway, and subsequently down-regulates the expression of VEGF and Flk-1 to cause aging-related impairment of renal angiogenesis. These findings provide new evidence for understanding the role of TIMP-1 in renal aging.","title":"[Effects of TIMP-1 on PTEN expression on renal tubular epithelial cells].","pubmedId":"23688979"}
