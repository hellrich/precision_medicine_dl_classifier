Thirty seven cases of lung cancer were investigated immunohistochemically for HER2 and HER3 expression. PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to analyze the presence of HER-2 SNP at codon 655 in 20 samples. The results were compared with clinical and pathological parameters of investigated patients.We found that 100% of the cases were negative for HER2, 29.7% were with moderate or strong HER3 expression and 70.3% of the tumors-without or with low expression for HER3. Lymph node metastasis were found in 40% of HER3 positive cases (χ(2) \u003d 4.752; p \u003d 0.029). Moderately-differentiated tumors do not express neither of investigated markers (χ(2) \u003d 6.719; p \u003d 0.035). HER2 RFLP-PCR analysis showed genotype AG in five patients (25%) and the rest of 15 cases (75%) had АА (Ile/Ile) genotype. Patients with metastasis had genotype АА (Ile/Ile) in 80% and genotype AG (Ile/Val) in 20% (χ(2) \u003d 2.857; p \u003d 0.091).Our results indicate that SNP in HER2 codon 655 and investigation of HER2 and HER3 expression could be helpful to outline the prognosis for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Impact of HER2 codon 655 polymorphism and expression of HER2 and HER3 in non small cell lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"26208475"}
