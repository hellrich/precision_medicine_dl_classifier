Currently, there are two FDA approved companion diagnostics that can be used to assess whether there are mutations in KRAS codons 12 and 13, and both include their own internal controls. However, there is a need for external reference materials that allow laboratories to validate such assays - especially, at levels near their limits of detection (LODs). We describe the design of the Seraseq™ FFPE Tumor KRAS Reference Material. This reference material is composed of 7 different 5-micron FFPE curls that contain the 7 different KRAS mutations detected by the companion diagnostics: G12A, G12C, G12D, G12R, G12S, G12V and G13D. Each curl contains a mixture of KRAS wildtype GM24385 cells and a KRAS mutant cell line in sufficient quantity for most assays. KRAS mutant frequencies of about 5% were targeted and subsequently verified by digital PCR. A 5% mutant frequency was selected because it is near the LOD for the existing companion diagnostics, and is close to the minimum reported frequency of many next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assays that test for somatic variants. The reference material was evaluated using different methods, which include digital PCR, the Roche cobas® KRAS Mutation Test, the QIAGEN therascreen® KRAS RGQ PCR Kit and several NGS-based assays. Testing revealed general compatibility with these assays in that sufficient DNA could be extracted, and concordance of the results with the expected calls was high. For example, apparent DNA yields by Nanodrop with the cobas assay exceeded the required amount by more than 3-fold and all 7 curls led to a “mutation detected” result in duplicate testing. Interestingly, not all variants were detected with the therascreen assay, which may be due to some variants being present at slightly below the claimed LODs, however DNA yields were sufficient and the correct variants were identified. Finally, variant frequencies obtained by NGS were consistent with those observed by digital PCR. We conclude that the Seraseq FFPE Tumor KRAS Reference Material may be useful as part of KRAS codon 12/13 assay validation.","title":"Multiple platform evaluation of KRAS codon 12/13 reference material.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-4651"}
