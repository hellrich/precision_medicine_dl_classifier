Since the 1980s, many investigators have tried to determine whether or not there is any benefit in introducing chemotherapy earlier in the therapeutic plan for these patients: either initially before surgery or radiotherapy (neoadjuvant), or during radiotherapy (concurrent), or after local treatment (adjuvant). In this review we seek to sum up the published data available and to determine if at present there is a place for chemotherapy in the initial treatment of cervical cancer.","title":"[Is there a place for chemotherapy in the initial treatment of cervical cancer?
