Exploratory analyses were performed to characterize relationships between mutation status and subtype and survival outcomes using a multivariable Cox model.\nAmong 1,543 patients (763 OBS, 780 ACT), 300 had KRAS mutations (codon 12, n \u003d 275; codon 13, n \u003d 24; codon 14, n \u003d 1). In OBS patients, there was no prognostic difference for overall survival for codon-12 (mutation v wild type [WT] hazard ratio [HR] \u003d 1.04; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.40) or codon-13 (HR \u003d 1.01; 95% CI, 0.47 to 2.17) mutations. No significant benefit from ACT was observed for WT-KRAS (ACT v OBS HR \u003d 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.04; P \u003d .15) or codon-12 mutations (HR \u003d 0.95; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.35; P \u003d .77); with codon-13 mutations, ACT was deleterious (HR \u003d 5.78; 95% CI, 2.06 to 16.2; P \u003c .001; interaction P \u003d .002). There was no prognostic effect for specific codon-12 amino acid substitution. The effect of ACT was variable among patients with codon-12 mutations: G12A or G12R (HR \u003d 0.66; P \u003d .48), G12C or G12V (HR \u003d 0.94; P \u003d .77) and G12D or G12S (HR \u003d 1.39; P \u003d .48; comparison of four HRs, including WT, interaction P \u003d .76). OBS patients with KRAS-mutated tumors were more likely to develop second primary cancers (HR \u003d 2.76, 95% CI, 1.34 to 5.70; P \u003d .005) but not ACT patients (HR \u003d 0.66; 95% CI, 0.25 to 1.75; P \u003d .40; interaction, P \u003d .02).\nKRAS mutation status is not significantly prognostic. The potential interaction in patients with codon-13 mutations requires validation. At this time, KRAS status cannot be recommended to select patients with NSCLC for ACT.","title":"Pooled analysis of the prognostic and predictive effects of KRAS mutation status and KRAS mutation subtype in early-stage resected non-small-cell lung cancer in four trials of adjuvant chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"23630215"}
