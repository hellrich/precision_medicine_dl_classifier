Concerning metastasis-free survival, age less than 50 years (P \u003d 0.040), male sex (P \u003d 0.040), pleomorphic subtype (P \u003c 0.001), and high histological grade (P \u003d 0.003) had a worse prognosis. Adverse factors for overall survival were age under 50 years (P \u003d 0.040), male sex (P \u003d 0.040), pleomorphic subtype (P \u003c 0.001), and high histological grade (P \u003d 0.003).\nThere was no correlation between immunohistochemically observed MDM2 protein expressions and the anatomical and pathological variables studied. The immunohistochemical expression of MDM2 protein was not considered to have a prognostic value for any of the surviving patients in this study (local recurrence-free survival, metastasis-free survival, or overall survival). The immunoexpression of MDM2 protein was a frequent event in the different subtypes of liposarcomas.","title":"Prognostic factors and expression of MDM2 in patients with primary extremity liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"18438568"}
