Because of this heterogeneity, we provide a conservative estimate that about 5% (1,460) of PC cases in the US annually are hereditary. Although this number is relatively small, members of hereditary PC families serve as excellent models for studying the etiology, natural history, biomarkers, pathogenesis, potential carcinogenic exposures and their perturbation of underlying genetic events, and treatment of PC. These individuals would benefit greatly from method(s) capable of detecting cancer at an early stage, and such knowledge would also be useful for improving the diagnosis of the much more common \u0027sporadic\u0027 form of PC.","title":"Hereditary pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"12120226"}
