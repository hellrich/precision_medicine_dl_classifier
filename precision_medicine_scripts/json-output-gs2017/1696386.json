Four out of the twelve cancer tissue specimens, one specimen of cancer ascites cells and the NIH: OVCAR-3 cancer cell line showed elevated amplification of c-Ki-ras, as compared to the human fibroblast cell line FS4 and normal ovarian tissues. The amplification of the c-Ki-ras gene showed some correlation with clinical stages of ovarian cancer. The levels of c-Ki-ras specific RNA transcripts and ras gene product p21 were also elevated in these four cancer tissue specimens. Surprisingly, a discrepancy between amplification and expression of c-Ki-ras was noted in five of the other eight cancer tissue specimens, in which enhanced expression of c-Ki-ras was present without the accompanying elevated amplification of c-Ki-ras. The results do provide some clues to understanding the possible mechanisms of tumorigenesis in human ovarian cancer.","title":"Amplification and expression of c-Ki-ras oncogene in human ovarian cancer.","pubmedId":"1696386"}
