Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has distinct clinical and pathologic features. The fact that this type is more aggressive despite lacking the expression of growth promotion receptors, suggest other players, as defect in tumor suppressors such as PTEN gene. To our knowledge this is the first study in English literature correlating TNBC to loss of PTEN protein expression.  The aim of this study is to establish data about the clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer in Palestinian women, and to study the status of PTEN protein expression  by immunohistochemistry in breast cancer and specifically in  TNBC.  Methods:  100 confirmed cases of breast cancer, were collected from different pathology centers, clinicopathological data; age, grade, stage for each case were specified. Each case was evaluated for the expression of hormone receptors, Her-2 status, and for PTEN protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to see if a certain pattern is noted.  Results:  Out of the 100 cases, the mean age at presentation was 53.3 years, 69.84% of the cases presented with advanced stage and 53% were high grade, 58% were ER positive and 46% were PR positive. HER-2 positive breast cancer were 26%. 30% of all breast cancer cases were TNBC subtype.  Loss of PTEN expression was seen in 44% of cases. 60% of TNBC cases lost PTEN expression, which was statistically significant (p \u003d 0.035), no significant correlation between PTEN loss and ER, PR, HER-2, grade or stage.  Conclusions:  Palestinian women have high incidence of TNBC in comparison to White population, and presented with high grade, and advanced stage tumors. There is a significant correlation between PTEN loss and TNBC that needs more research and study.","title":"PTEN expression in Palestinian women with breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative subtype.","pubmedId":"ASCO_86383-111"}
