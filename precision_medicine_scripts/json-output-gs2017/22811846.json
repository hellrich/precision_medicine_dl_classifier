The treatment options in pancreatic cancer remain limited. This review provides an overview of the role of radiotherapy (RT) alone or in combination with systemic treatment at different settings of treatment strategy. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) may downstage the borderline resectable disease and make resection possible, which could translate to a survival benefit. Although the benefit of adjuvant CRT remains controversial due to inconsistent outcome of randomized trials, in North America it is still a common recommendation of the treatment. For locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the treatment option could either be chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. By using advanced radiotherapy modalities, the toxicity of RT could be reduced and RT dose escalation becomes possible to improve locoregional control.","title":"The role of radiotherapy in management of pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"22811846"}
