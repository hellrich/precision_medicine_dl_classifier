Animals were divided into control, COPD, COPD + drinking water containing three concentrations of extract of Z. multiflora (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg/ml), COPD + drinking water containing three concentrations of carvacrol (60, 120 and 240 µg/ml) and COPD + dexamethasone (50 µg/ml). COPD was induced by exposing animals to cigarette smoke for 3 months. Emphysema as a pathological change of the lung and tracheal responsiveness were measured (n \u003d 5 for control and COPD groups and n \u003d 6 for another groups). Tracheal responsiveness (p \u003c 0.05) and emphysema were significantly increased (p \u003c 0.001) in COPD compared to the control group. Tracheal responsiveness in COPD groups treated with two higher concentrations of the Z. multiflora and three concentrations of carvacrol, and emphysema in treated with highest concentration of Z. multiflora and carvacrol were significantly improved compared to COPD group. Studied parameters were also significantly improved in the treated group with dexamethasone compared to COPD animals (p \u003c 0.05 to p \u003c 0.01). The results indicated a preventive effect of Z. multiflora extract and its constituent, carvacrol, on tracheal responsiveness and pathological changes of the lung.","title":"The Effect of Zataria multiflora and its Constituent, Carvacrol, on Tracheal Responsiveness and Lung Pathology in Guinea Pig Model of COPD.","pubmedId":"25682768"}
