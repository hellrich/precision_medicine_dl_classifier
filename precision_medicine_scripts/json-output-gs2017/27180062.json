Localization (intracellular or membranous), density, and the intensity of cytoplasmic staining were characterized semiquantitatively. Extrathyroidal invasion, surgical margin positivity, and lymph node metastasis were compared with BRAF(V600E) mutation and NIS expression. Eighty-eight patients who had at least 24-month follow-up were also included in survival analysis. BRAF(V600E) mutation was determined in 78.1% (75/96) and functional NIS activity in 74% (71/96) of the cases. There were statistically significant differences in mean ages between BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive (48.6) and BRAF(V600E) mutation-negative cases (37.3; Levene test, P\u003d.419; Student t test, P\u003d.001). The surgical margin positivity (46.7%) and extrathyroidal extension percentage (54.7%) in the BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive group were higher than the negative (28.6% and 33.3%, respectively) group, without statistical significance (P\u003d.138 and P\u003d.084, respectively). Functional NIS activity was higher in BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive cases (78.1%) than mutation-negative ones (57.1%; P\u003d.047). The possibility of moderate and intense cytoplasmic staining in BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive cases (72%) was 6.3 times higher than the possibility of weak staining (28%) in the mutation-positive cases (95% confidence interval, 2.2-18.8; P\u003d.001). Functional NIS expression is higher in patients with classical variant papillary thyroid cancer with BRAF(V600E) mutation. However, the clinical features were not found to be associated with NIS expression. There may be different mechanisms determining the outcome of therapy.
