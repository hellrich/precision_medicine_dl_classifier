Male gender and advanced age are indicators of increased risk for bariatric surgery. Good results have been shown in patients older than 50, but nearly all published studies include a large majority of females, and few include patients \u003e60 years old. In this study, we examined the results of males over 60 years old.\nWe reviewed a prospective database of 107 consecutive patients who underwent bariatric surgery between April 2002 and June 2007 at the Palo Alto VA. Of these, 60 patients were males older than 50 and available for follow-up 12 months postoperatively. There were 47 males 50-59 years old (group I) and 13 males older than 60 years (group II). Data were analyzed using Student\u0027s t test.\nMean preoperative body mass index was similar in both groups (49.4 vs. 47.5 kg/m(2); p \u003d 0.468). Length of hospital stay was similar (3.2 vs. 3.5 days; p \u003d 0.678), but early morbidity was higher in group II patients (30.8% vs. 8.5%; p \u003d 0.037). Morbidity included urinary tract infection, cardiac arrhythmias, and early bowel obstruction. Excess weight loss after 1 year was not significantly different (63.6% vs. 60.6%; p \u003d 0.565). Diabetes resolution or improvement was seen in 87% of group I patients and 90% of group II patients.\nDespite a higher early morbidity rate, obese males \u003e/\u003d60 years old perform as well as male patients 50-59 years old with respect to excess weight loss, mortality, length of stay, and improvement of diabetes, at 1 year postoperatively.","title":"Male patients above age 60 have as good outcomes as male patients 50-59 years old at 1-year follow-up after bariatric surgery.","pubmedId":"18855082"}
