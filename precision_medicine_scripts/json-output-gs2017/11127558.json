To avoid rupture of the aneurysm, the right coronary orifice was closed. Subsequently, the arteriovenous fistula orifice adjacent to the coronary venous sinus was closed. In addition, to avoid transfer of a thrombus in the aneurysm to the RCA, suture ligature of the right coronary aneurysm was performed, and surgery was completed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative heart catheterization showed good collateral blood circulation from the LAD to the RCA.","title":"[A 62-year-old patient with congenital coronary arteriovenous fistula demonstrating dilatation and contortion that corresponded to the aorta in thickness: a case report].","pubmedId":"11127558"}
