BRAF V600E (VE1) IHC was performed on tissue sections from PTC cases to determine mutation status. Molecular tests (Sanger sequencing/ARMS) were used to confirm the BRAF V600E gene mutation in primary PTC.\nA uniformly cytoplasmic staining throughout the tumors was observed in IHC-positive cases. BRAF V600E was detected in 68.6% (81/118) of PTC samples by IHC and in 61.9% (73/118) by Sanger sequencing/ARMS. The overall concordance between IHC and Sanger sequencing/ARMS was 93.2% (110/118). The sensitivity and specificity of the BRAF V600E IHC was 100% (73/73) and 82.2% (37/45), respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 90.1% (73/81) and 100% (37/37), respectively. Expression of the BRAF V600E mutant protein was detected in all of 59 cases of primary carcinoma and corresponding metastatic carcinoma in lymph nodes. The concordance between IHC staining in primary and metastatic PTC was 100% (59/59).\nIHC using VE1 antibody for detection of the BRAF V600E mutant protein expression in PTC showed high sensitivity and acceptable specificity, which are critical for diagnostic purposes. IHC staining for BRAF V600E showed uniformly cytoplasmic expression in both primary tumor and metastatic nodes. Therefore, IHC has high practical value for the detection of the BRAF V600E mutation in metastatic and primary PTC.","title":"Specific immunohistochemical detection of the BRAF V600E mutation in primary and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26795218"}
