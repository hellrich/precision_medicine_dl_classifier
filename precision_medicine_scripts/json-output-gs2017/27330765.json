Previously, mesenteric leiomyosarcoma was not differentiated from gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), which is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, and several cases of GIST may have been misclassified as mesenteric leiomyosarcoma. Thus, the actual clinicopathological characteristics of mesenteric leiomyosarcomas remain unclear. We herein describe a case of leiomyosarcoma arising in the descending mesocolon in a patient who developed metachronous liver metastasis. A 76-year-old woman reported a mass in her left upper abdomen. Computed tomography imaging revealed a low-density tumor adjacent to the descending colon. The patient underwent surgery and the tumor was resected along with part of the descending colon. Immunohistochemical differential diagnosis revealed that the tumor was positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin, and negative for CD117 (c-KIT) and S-100, which are characteristic of gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma. A single liver metastasis developed 24 months after the operation. The patient underwent curative resection of the metastatic lesion. Sixteen months following surgery for the liver metastasis and 40 months after the initial removal of the primary lesion, the patient remains disease-free. The prognosis of leiomyosarcoma remains poor and standardized chemotherapy for this rare disease has not yet been established. Early diagnosis and surgical removal of the tumor is the only potentially curative option for liver metastasis of mesenteric leiomyosarcoma.","title":"Curative resection for leiomyosarcoma of the descending mesocolon with metachronous liver metastasis: A case report and literature review.","pubmedId":"27330765"}
