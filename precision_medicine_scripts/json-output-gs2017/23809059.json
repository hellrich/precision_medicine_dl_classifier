The approved dosage is 250 mg/body/day without adjustment for physical size such as body surface area (BSA), and the impact of physical size on the efficacy of gefitinib has not been evaluated. Here, we sought to clarify this issue using a retrospective cohort. We reviewed the medical records of patients with consecutive advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations who underwent gefitinib monotherapy at Okayama University Hospital. In total, 101 patients were included in this study, and the median BSA in this cohort was 1.5 m(2). The median progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients with higher BSA (â‰¥1.5 m(2)) was significantly worse than that of those with lower BSA (\u003c 1.5 m(2)) (10.4 vs. 18.0 months; p \u003d 0.019, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis also showed a significant impact of BSA on PFS (hazards ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.78-2.89; p \u003d 0.002). By contrast, no significant association between BSA and PFS was observed in those undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy (4.0 vs. 5.1 months; p \u003d 0.989, log-rank test), suggesting that BSA is a predictive, rather than a prognostic, marker for gefitinib therapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. In conclusion, BSA affected PFS in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who underwent gefitinib monotherapy, suggesting the need for appraisal of BSA-based dose adjustment, even for this molecular target-based therapy.","title":"Impact of physical size on gefitinib efficacy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations.","pubmedId":"23809059"}
