TNM staging was carried out before surgery and compared with findings of histology and/or surgery.\nEndosonography was accurate in staging the depth of tumor invasion. Early-stage carcinomas could be distinguished from advanced cancers. Nonresectability was accurately assessed on the basis of vascular involvement using real-time ultrasound. Tumor compression due to peritumoral pancreatitis and direct tumor invasion into the base of the mesocolon could not be diagnosed by endosonography. The overall accuracy in tumor staging for pancreatic and ampullary carcinomas was 83.6% and 84.4%, respectively. Endosonography was accurate in diagnosing regional lymph node metastases but not accurate in defining nonmetastatic lymphadenopathy and distant metastases.\nEndosonography was accurate in staging tumor stage and lymph node metastases. Minimally invasive methods of resection for superficial ampullary cancers should be based on endosonography staging.","title":"Staging of ampullary and pancreatic carcinoma: comparison between endosonography and surgery.","pubmedId":"8979062"}
