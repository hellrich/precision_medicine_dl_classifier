Epidemiologic and other data suggest that high-fat and low-fiber diets are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Several pilot intervention studies have been performed to decrease dietary fat intake in women with breast cancer. Other studies suggest that weight gain after breast cancer is common and may be detrimental to survival. Taken together, all of these data suggest that further studies should be undertaken to better understand the relationship between nutritional factors and the development of breast cancer.","title":"Nutrition and breast cancer.","pubmedId":"8292508"}
