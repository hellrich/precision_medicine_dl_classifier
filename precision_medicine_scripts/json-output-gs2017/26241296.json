There is no single standard technique in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery approach. Although these \"minimally invasive\" resections are habitually performed through 3-port or 4-port incision, we performed a left lower lobectomy in a 54-year-old male patient for lung cancer, through a 3-cm single-port incision.
