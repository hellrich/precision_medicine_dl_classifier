This serum is capable of immunoprecipitating a protein of 98,000 daltons from cell extracts of normal, uninfected chicken bone marrow cells. This normal cellular protein (NCP98) was shown to be structurally related to P140, sharing the majority of 35S-methionine-labeled tryptic peptides with the viral gene product P140. NCP98 is a phosphoprotein in vivo, with an associated in vitro protein kinase activity, capable of phosphorylating specifically at tyrosine residues of NCP98 itself and alpha-casein, an externally added substrate. This kinase activity is biochemically indistinguishable from the kinase activity associated with P140 by all criteria tested. Moreover, in vitro-phosphorylated NCP98 and P140 shared the same phosphopeptides. The expression of NCP98 is tissue-specific. It is readily detectable in bone marrow cells and detectable to a lesser extent in liver and lung cells from 6--18 day old chickens.","title":"A cellular protein is immunologically crossreactive with and functionally homologous to the Fujinami sarcoma virus transforming protein.","pubmedId":"7094017"}
