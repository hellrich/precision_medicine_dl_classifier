Nearly all tumors have a mutation in the KIT or, less often, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRA) or B-rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (BRAF) gene. The discovery of constitutive KIT activation as the central mechanism of GIST pathogenesis, suggested that inhibiting or blocking KIT signaling might be the milestone in the targeted therapy of GISTs. Indeed, imatinib mesylate inhibits KIT kinase activity and represents the front line drug for the treatment of unresectable and advanced GISTs, achieving a partial response or stable disease in about 80% of patients with metastatic GIST. KIT mutation status has a significant impact on treatment response. Patients with the most common exon 11 mutation experience higher rates of tumor shrinkage and prolonged survival, as tumors with an exon 9 mutation or wild-type KIT are less likely to respond to imatinib. Although imatinib achieves a partial response or stable disease in the majority of GIST patients, complete and lasting responses are rare. About half of the patients who initially benefit from imatinib treatment eventually develop drug resistance. The most common mechanism of resistance is through polyclonal acquisition of second site mutations in the kinase domain, which highlights the future therapeutic challenges in salvaging these patients after failing kinase inhibitor monotherapies. More recently, sunitinib (Sutent, Pfizer, New York, NY), which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) in addition to KIT and PDGFRA, has proven efficacious in patients who are intolerant or refractory to imatinib. This review summarizes the recent knowledge on targeted therapy in GIST, based on the central role of KIT oncogenic activation, as well as discussing mechanisms of resistance.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"22015552"}
