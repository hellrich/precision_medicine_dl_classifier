So far only about 150 cases of PPL have been reported.\nWe present our experience of 3 cases of PPL over a 4-year period.\nAll the patients presented with vague abdominal pain of duration ranging from 1(1/2) months to 3 months. Two patients had diagnosis confirmed histologically by CT-guided core biopsy or Fine needle aspiration procedure. We were able to avoid unnecessary laparotomy in 2 patients using preoperative guided Fine needle aspiration Cytology, although the third patient did undergo a Whipple\u0027s procedure as the diagnosis of PPL was not considered during the initial workup.\nThere is no significant difference noted with regard to patient\u0027s age or duration of symptoms between patients with either pancreatic adenocarcinoma or PPL. The differential diagnosis of PPL includes pancreatic adenocarcinoma and secondary involvement of pancreas from extra-nodal lymphoma. Combination of two things is suggestive of Pancreatic lymphoma: (1) Bulky localized tumor in pancreatic head (2) Absence of significant dilatation of main pancreatic duct strengthens a diagnosis of pancreatic lymphoma over adenocarcinoma. Majority of patients can be managed with chemotherapy with much better prognosis compared to patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Larger series of patients are needed to evaluate whether chemotherapy, eventually followed by involved-field radiation therapy, is the treatment of choice for PPL.","title":"Primary pancreatic lymphoma: Report of three cases with review of literature.","pubmedId":"20668602"}
