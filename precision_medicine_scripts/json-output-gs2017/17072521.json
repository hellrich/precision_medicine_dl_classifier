The aim of this study was to review the clinical, radiologic and histopathologic features of these aggressive variants as well as the outcome after multimodality therapy.\n16 patients with atypical meningiomas (n \u003d 11) and anaplastic meningiomas (n \u003d 5) were treated in the Departments of Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology at the University Hospital of Philipps University Marburg, Germany, between 1997 and 2003. Tumor grading was based on new WHO criteria. There were eleven men and five women with a mean age of 54 years. The median follow-up period was 34 months.\nA total of 24 surgical procedures were performed for these 16 patients. Only seven patients underwent postoperative fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Patients with atypical meningioma received radiotherapy only for the recurrent disease. Six patients (37.5%) experienced tumor recurrence after a mean period of 27.2 months in spite of gross total resection. Radiographic findings suggestive of aggressiveness were observed mostly with WHO grade III meningiomas. By comparing the proliferation rate in four cases with atypical meningioma operated twice, the recurrent tumor had a higher proliferation rate than the first tumor in three cases. A special proliferation pattern was noticed in MIB-1 with anaplastic meningiomas. The mean overall survival period was 66.5 months. There was no mortality among patients with atypical meningioma, while four out of five patients with anaplastic meningioma died during follow-up.\nConsidering the higher rate of recurrence in aggressive meningiomas even after radical surgical excision and the possibility that the recurrent tumor is more aggressive than the original one, surgery should be combined with postoperative fractionated radiotherapy to improve local tumor control. The peculiar focal expression patterns of anaplastic meningioma in MIB-1 might be a marker of such malignant development.","title":"Clinicopathologic features of aggressive meningioma emphasizing the role of radiotherapy in treatment.","pubmedId":"17072521"}
