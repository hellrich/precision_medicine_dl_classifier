Complete blood picture revealed moderate normochromic normocytic anaemia with anisocytosis. Other laboratory results including liver function tests, renal functions tests, serum amylase, fasting blood sugar level and serum electrolytes were all of normal values. Abdominal US showed a focal mass of the pancreatic body and tail with involvement of the spleen and the transverse colon. Laparotomy confirmed the sonographic findings and demonstrated adhesions of the transverse colon to the mass at the splenic hilum. Histology of the mass showed a well differentiated adenocarcinona of the body and tail of the pancreas. This highlights the differentiation of pancreatic cancer from autoimmune pancreatitis and, to a lesser extent, other forms of pancreatitis and benign pancreatic lesions.","title":"Pancreatic cancer in an 18-year-old boy.","pubmedId":"22275938"}
