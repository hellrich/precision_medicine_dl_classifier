We present 3 patients with this endocrine tumour. The first patient, a 41-year-old woman complaining of diarrhoea, a painful abdomen, weight loss and sensibility disorders in both legs, had metastases of MTC in the spine, with little progression during 2 years of follow-up. The second patient, a 64-year-old woman suffering from a painful nodule in the neck and a painful shoulder, was diagnosed with MTC and liver, lung and bone metastases. She died after 14 months due to progressive disease. The third patient, an 81-year-old woman with hyperparathyroidism, was coincidentally diagnosed with MTC after goitre surgery at the age of 67. When she was evaluated for rising calcitonin levels, a pheochromocytoma was found. RET mutation analysis confirmed a MEN2A syndrome. Current diagnostic procedures of MTC may include positron emission tomography with 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG-PET) and 18F-diphenylalanine (DOPA-PET). MTC is usually treated surgically. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors appear to offer potential new therapeutic possibilities.","title":"[Medullary thyroid cancer, a tumour with many appearances].","pubmedId":"20858319"}
