All 184 patients who underwent resection between January 1983 and December 1993 were included. Recurrence of disease, survival and prognostic factors were determined. The overall cumulative 5-year recurrence rate was 71% and the survival rate 23%. Multivariate analysis identified locoregional lymph node and distant metastases as the crucial prognosticators of recurrence of disease and survival. These results were similar to those from a previous study concerning our patients operated during the years 1983-88. The prognosis of a resected cardiacarcinoma has remained unchanged in our hands over the past 10 years. These results stress the importance of exploring new ways, such as the use of new diagnostic tools, to optimize preoperative patient selection and more aggressive treatment regimens to improve final outcome.","title":"Recurrence and survival after resection of adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia.
