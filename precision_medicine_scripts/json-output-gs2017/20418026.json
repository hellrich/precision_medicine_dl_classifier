We report the histology of the radiation-induced meningioma, treatment received, and ultimate outcome among this cohort of patients.\nMeningioma was diagnosed at a median of 23.5 years after completion of the primary radiation. Fifty percent of second meningiomas were World Health Organization Grade 2 (atypical) or higher. All cases were managed with a single modality: resection alone (n \u003d 7), fractionated radiotherapy (n \u003d 2), and stereotactic radiosurgery (n \u003d 1). The actuarial event-free survival and overall survival rate at 5 years after treatment for a radiation-induced meningioma was 89%. Three patients who underwent resection for retreatment experienced a Grade 3 toxicity.\nRadiation-induced meningiomas after treatment of pediatric CNS tumors are effectively managed with single-modality therapy. Such late-effect data inform the overall therapeutic ratio and support the continued role of selective irradiation in managing pediatric CNS malignancies.","title":"Favorable outcomes of pediatric patients treated with radiotherapy to the central nervous system who develop radiation-induced meningiomas.","pubmedId":"20418026"}
