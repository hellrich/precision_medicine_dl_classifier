The purpose of this study is to evaluate the different characteristics and prognoses among different subtypes of young breast cancer patients.\nThe study included 1360 patients \u003c40 years-old (y) and 3110 patients 40-50y with operable breast cancer in Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University. The characteristics, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared.\nThe median follow-up was 54.1 months. More grade III tumors and more lymph-vascular invasions (P \u003c 0.01) were presented in \u003c40y group when compared with 40-50y group. More patients \u003c40y presented with Luminal B (25.3% vs. 17.5%, P \u003c 0.01) and triple negative (16.7% vs. 13.4%, P \u003c 0.05) breast cancer while fewer had Luminal A tumor (48.5% vs. 59.2%, P \u003c 0.01). Younger patients with tumors of both Luminal A and Luminal B types were at increased risk for worse DFS (P \u003d 0.03, HR \u003d 1.69, 95% CI \u003d 1.05-2.72; P \u003c 0.01, HR \u003d 3.61, 95% CI \u003d 2.50-5.22) when compared with the older patients. Patients \u003c40y with Luminal B tumor had a two point five fold higher risk of death compared with older counterparts (P \u003c 0.01, HR \u003d 2.54, 95% CI \u003d 1.35-4.79), however, a worse overall survival rate was not observed in the younger women with Luminal A breast cancer (P \u003e 0.05). In multivariate analysis, Luminal B subtype was also a strong predictor of disease relapse (HR \u003d 1.09, 95% CI \u003d 1.01 to 1.19, P \u003c 0.01) in younger patients with Luminal subtype tumors.\nCharacteristics of breast cancer suggested a more aggressive biology in Chinese patients with breast cancer diagnosed at young age. Luminal B subtype may have a negative effect on the prognosis of young patients in China which should be validated further.","title":"Luminal B subtype: a key factor for the worse prognosis of young breast cancer patients in China.","pubmedId":"25885213"}
