To determine whether PI3Ks are genetically altered in human cancers, we recently analyzed the sequences of the PI3K gene family and discovered that one member, the PIK3CA gene encoding the p110alpha catalytic subunit, was frequently mutated in cancers of the colon, breast, brain and lung. The majority of mutations clustered near two positions within the PI3K helical or catalytic domains and at least one hotspot mutation appeared to increase kinase activity. PIK3CA represents one of the most highly mutated oncogenes identified in human cancers and may be a useful diagnostic and therapeutic target.","title":"Oncogenic mutations of PIK3CA in human cancers.","pubmedId":"15467468"}
