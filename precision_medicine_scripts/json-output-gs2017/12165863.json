Trp53 mutations were detected in 41% (7 out of 17) of tumors. Each tumor with a Trp53 mutation also exhibited loss of the wild-type Trp53 allele, supporting the importance of Trp53 inactivation during development of these tumors. Analyses of the Hras1, Kras2 and Nras proto-oncogenes revealed Hras1 mutations in 53% (9 out of 17) of tumors. Seven of these mutations were a G--\u003eC transversion in Hras1 codon 13, consistent with a 1,3-butadiene-specific Kras2 mutation previously reported in several other tumor types. Mutation screens in Catnb exon 2, the Apc mutation cluster region and the Catnb-binding domain of the Axin gene identified Catnb missense mutations in 3 out of 17 (18%) tumors. In total, mutations of the Trp53, Hras1 and/or Catnb genes were identified in 15 out of 17 1,3-butadiene-induced mammary adenocarcinomas. These results indicate that multiple genetic pathways are disrupted in chemically induced mammary tumors, and that studies in mouse models may help to understand the etiology of human breast cancers.","title":"Frequent mutations of the Trp53, Hras1 and beta-catenin (Catnb) genes in 1,3-butadiene-induced mammary adenocarcinomas in B6C3F1 mice.","pubmedId":"12165863"}
