Cell images were obtained randomly using inverted microscopy and TEM. The morphometric parameters of ultrastructure were tested using precise morphometric techniques by Image-Pro Plus analysis software.\n(1) The diameter of A549 cells from inverted microscopy and TEM images was 14.93 μm and 10.59 μm. (2) By defining cell as reference space the volume densities (VV) of nucleus and cytoplasm were about 0.28 and 0.72; the surface densities (SV) of nucleus were 0.19 μm-1. By defining cell nucleus as reference space the VV of nucleoli, euchromatin and heterochromatin were 0.076, 0.72 and 0.20 respectively; the SV of nucleoli was 0.15 μm-1. By defining cytoplasm as reference space the VV of mitochondria, lamellar bodies and lysosomes were 0.046, 0.025 and 0.014; the SV of mitochondria, lamellar bodies and lysosomes were 0.60 μm-1, 0.36 μm-1, and 0.18 μm-1. (3) In individual A549 cell total volume and surface of mitochondria were 61.91 μm³ and 1001.67 μm²; Total volume and surface area of lamellar bodies were 76.82 μm³ and 428.68 μm²; Total volume and surface area of lysosomes were 21.69 μm³ and 212.04 μm².\nThe morphometric parameters of some ultrastructures within A549 cells were established using precise morphometric techniques by Image-Pro Plus analysis software.","title":"The morphometrical analysis on the ultrastructure of A549 cells.","pubmedId":"21103623"}
