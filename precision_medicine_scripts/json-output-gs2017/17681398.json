PIK3CA amplification incidence was significantly higher in male, smoker and squamous cell carcinoma patients. Among 11 patients with PIK3CA amplification, two patients harbored a PIK3CA mutation. There was significant difference in survival between the patients with PIK3CA normal copy number and the patients with PIK3CA amplification.","title":"PIK3CA gene amplification in Japanese non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"17681398"}
