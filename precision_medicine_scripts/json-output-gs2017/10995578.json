Protein sequencing of the immunoaffinity purified 120-kDa protein showed it to be an as yet unknown protein. DNA sequencing revealed a cDNA sequence of 3419 bases, which includes the complete coding region of ropp120 of 2943 bases (981 amino acids). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed that ropp 120 contains four WD repeats and a well-conserved consensus sequence of serine proteases. The gene encoding ropp120 (HGMW-approved gene symbol C2orf2) was assigned to chromosome 2p21-p22 by means of radiation hybrid and fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping.","title":"Cloning and localization of C2orf2(ropp120), a previously unknown WD repeat protein.","pubmedId":"10995578"}
