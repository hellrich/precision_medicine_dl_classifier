In this study, we showed that LY294002 inhibited the viability of gastric cancer SGC7901 cells. We also showed that LY294002 increased the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and increased monodansylcadaverine (MDC)-labeled vesicles. LY294002 activated autophagy by activating p53 and caspase-3, and induced apoptosis by up-regulating p53 and p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). Therefore, LY294002 might induce cytotoxicity in SGC7901 cells through activation of p53 and the downstream point PUMA. These findings suggest that inhibition of the class I PI3K signaling pathway is a potential strategy for managing gastric cancers.","title":"Class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 activates autophagy and induces apoptosis through p53 pathway in gastric cancer cell line SGC7901.","pubmedId":"18330473"}
