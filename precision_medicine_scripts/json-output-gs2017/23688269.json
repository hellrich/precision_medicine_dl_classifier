There is no report on E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nWe used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts in human NSCLC tissue specimens and cell lines. We analyzed correlation of E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts with clinical outcomes in 76 patients with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and other subgroups. We compared mutation status of k-ras, p53 and EGFR in 22 patients with E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts.\nWe detected E2A-PBX1 transcripts in 23 of 184 (12.5%) NSCLC tissue specimens and 3 of 13 (23.1%) NSCLC cell lines. Presence of E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts correlated with smoking status in female patients (P\u003d0.048), AIS histology (P\u003d0.006) and tumor size (P\u003d0.026). The overall survival was associated with gender among AIS patients (P\u003d0.0378) and AIS patients without E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts (P\u003d0.0345), but not among AIS patients with E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts (P\u003d0.6401). The overall survival was also associated with status of E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts among AIS stage IA patients (P\u003d0.0363) and AIS stage IA female patients (P\u003d0.0174). In addition, among the 22 patients with E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts, 12 (54.5%) patients including all four non-smokers, showed no common mutations in k-ras, p53 and EGFR.\nE2A-PBX1 fusion gene caused by t(1;19)(q23;p13) may be a common genetic change in AIS and a survival determinant for female AIS patients at early stage.","title":"Detection of E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts in human non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23688269"}
