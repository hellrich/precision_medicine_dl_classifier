Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of lung tumor diagnoses. Squamous cell lung cancer (SQCLC) is a common pathological type, almost 20%-30% of NSCLC. Surgery, chemotherapy, and molecular targeted therapies are the mainstay of treatment for patients with SQCLC. But most patients are diagnosed at advanced stage so that they miss the chance of operation. While noteworthy outcomes have improved with adenocarcinoma of lung with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), a therapeutic plateau for advanced squamous cell lung cancer patients are still not solved. EGFR-TKIs are unsuitable for or mostly ineffective in advanced SQCLC. Patients with advanced SQCLC ramain treated with platinum based chemotherapy. This reciew systematicly describe the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.","title":"[Treatment of Advanced Squamous Cell Lung Cancer].","pubmedId":"27760600"}
