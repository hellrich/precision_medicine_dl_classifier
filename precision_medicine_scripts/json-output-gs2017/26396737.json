Importantly, different mutations within these two genes can lead to very different levels of sensitivity or resistance to kinase inhibitor therapy. Due to rarity, sensitivity or resistance of exon 12 PDGFRA mutant GIST to kinase inhibitor therapy is not well defined.\nWe report the case of a patient with a PDGFRA exon 12 mutated GIST. The patient experienced a very good response to imatinib in the neoadjuvant setting, but then relapsed while still on adjuvant imatinib. In this patient, we report a dramatic response to second line treatment with sunitinib, with complete resolution of two liver lesions at the time of first restaging.\nThis is the first report detailing a response to treatment with sunitinib of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor with an uncommon exon 12 PDGFRA mutation. Based on the observed efficacy, GIST patients with this rare molecular subtype should be considered for sunitinib therapy.","title":"Response to sunitinib of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor with a rare exon 12 PDGFRA mutation.","pubmedId":"26396737"}
