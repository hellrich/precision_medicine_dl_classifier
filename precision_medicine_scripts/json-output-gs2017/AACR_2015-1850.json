Pim-1 has been shown to be overexpressed in a variety of cancers and has been implicated in human prostate tumorigenesis. The aim of our study was to clarify the role of Pim-1 during the prostate tumorigenesis and determine its potential as a molecular target for therapy. To accomplish this goal, we carried out a series of experiments using a genetically engineered mouse model of prostate cancer driven by the conditional inactivation of PTEN. High levels of Pim-1 were observed during the early stages of the tumorigenesis process which decreased as tumors progressed. Expression of Pim-1 was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), well-differentiated, and moderately-differentiated tumors. In poorly-differentiated tumors, Pim-1expression was heterogeneously expressed at lower levels and was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of cancer cells. Levels of Pim-1 expression were increased in tumors from mice after surgical castration. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of Pim-1as a target for prostate cancer, we tested the antitumor effects of AZD1208, a highly potent Pim kinase inhibitor, on a panel of cell lines derived from castration-nave and castration-resistant mouse prostate cancer. AZD1208 inhibited the tumor cell growth of several cell lines and demonstrated higher sensitivity to those derived from castration resistant tumors. In vivo, drug intervention studies show that treatment with AZD1208 reduced tumor growth of castration-nave and castration-resistant prostate tumors by 12.1 (P \u003d 0.162) and 24.3% (P\u003c0.001), respectively. These findings provide further support for a role of Pim-1 during prostate tumorigenesis and could thus serve as a rational target for the development of novel combination strategies.","title":"Evaluation of Pim-1 kinase inhibition in a preclinical model of mouse prostate cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-1850"}
