A subset of these individuals have a hereditary form of pancreatic cancer designated by association with such hereditary disorders as familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, hereditary pancreatitis, or familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome. A subset of those FAMMM kindred with the CDKN2A (p16) germline mutation that expresses both pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma may constitute a new hereditary pancreatic cancer-prone syndrome.","title":"Update on familial pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"11276379"}
