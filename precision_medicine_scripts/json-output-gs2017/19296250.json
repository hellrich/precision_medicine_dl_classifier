All the cases were grouped according to Fletcher\u0027s risk scheme. Life table and COX regression model were used to evaluate the prognostic factors.\nOut of 181 tumors, 107(59.1%) were located in stomach, 51 (28.2%) in intestine and 23(12.7%) in colorectum or other sites. Distant metastases,including liver metastases were found in 7 patients intraoperatively. Tumor size ranged from 0.5 to 30 cm with the mean of 7.02 cm. The positive rate of CD117 was 94.5% (171/181) and that of CD34 was 86.2% (156/181). One hundred and seventy-six patients underwent complete resections, including multi-organ resections in 26 patients. The other patients underwent palliative operations. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates of 181 patients were 95.2%, 87.9% and 78.5% respectively. Univariate analysis revealed age, tumor size, primary organ of tumor, mitotic count, Fletcher\u0027s classification and multi-organ resection were associated with survival rate. No significant difference of sex was existed among groups. COX hazard proportional model revealed that advanced stage and large tumor size indicated worse prognosis. Eight patients with high risk of recurrence and 3 patients with recurrence and metastasis were stable after receiving imatinib therapy.\nThe diagnosis of GIST depends on endoscope and CT. Fletcher\u0027s classification is simple and effective to evaluate GIST behavior and prognosis. Surgical resection is still the main therapy for GIST and targeted therapy will play a more important role for prognosis in the future.","title":"[Analysis of clinicopathology and prognosis in 181 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors].","pubmedId":"19296250"}
