A group of 29 European surgeons and pathologists, recognized as international experts, analyzed the surgical and pathological procedures used in European countries to resect pancreatic cancer and examine the specimen.\nA general agreement was reached on the definitions of standard , \u0027radical and \u0027extended radical Kausch-Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy for carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, and standard and \u0027radical left pancreatectomy for carcinoma of the body and tail of the pancreas. Segmental venous resection, as well as adjacent organ resection, can be performed at the time of standard, radical or extended radical pancreatoduodenectomy or left pancreatectomy if required. The pylorus-preserving procedure is contraindicated only for carcinomas of the anteriorsuperior part of the head of the pancreas. Guidelines for a standardized pathological examination of the resected specimen were produced.\nAdoption of the recommended terminology will improve outcome comparisons between institutions performing the different procedures. Moreover, standardization of operations, terminology and pathological reporting is essential for prospective randomized trials comparing different operations either alone or within the context of adjuvant therapy studies.","title":"A surgical and pathological based classification of resective treatment of pancreatic cancer.
