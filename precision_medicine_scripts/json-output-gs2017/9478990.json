However, the molecular link between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and these biological responses has been poorly understood. Recently, it has been shown that protein kinase B (PKB/c-Akt/Rac) lies immediately downstream from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Here, we show that expression of a constitutively active form of PKB induced glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and protein synthesis in L6 myotubes downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and independent of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Introduction of constitutively active PKB induced glucose uptake and protein synthesis but not glycogen synthesis in 3T3L-1 adipocytes, which lack expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 different from L6 myotubes. Furthermore, we show that deactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and activation of rapamycin-sensitive serine/threonine kinase by PKB in L6 myotubes might be involved in the enhancement of glycogen synthesis and protein synthesis, respectively. These results suggest that PKB acts as a key enzyme linking phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation to multiple biological functions of insulin through regulation of downstream kinases in skeletal muscle, a major target tissue of insulin.","title":"Potential role of protein kinase B in insulin-induced glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, and protein synthesis.","pubmedId":"9478990"}
