Protein expression and clinicopathological variables were compared statistically for the evaluation of novel biomarkers.\nOne hundred seventy-seven proteins displaying significant quantitative changes compared with adjacent normal-appearing lung tissue were identified in more than 9 out of 12 lung adenocarcinoma patients. Based on the results of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, Ingenuity Pathway, and immunohistochemical analyses, anterior gradient homolog 2 (AGR2) (upregulated 9.9-fold) was selected as a potential biomarker of human lung adenocarcinoma. AGR2 was positive in 94% of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Negative AGR2 expression was associated with poor survival (p \u003d 0.007).\nAGR2 is likely to become a biomarker for clinical applications.","title":"AGR2 as a potential biomarker of human lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23094510"}
