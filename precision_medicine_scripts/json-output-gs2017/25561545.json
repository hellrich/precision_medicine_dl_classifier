The common activating mutations occur in exons 1 or 2 and therefore, render both splice variants oncogenic. K-Ras4A has been understudied, because it has been considered a minor splice variant. By priming off of the splice junction, we developed a quantitative RT-PCR assay for K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B message capable of measuring absolute amounts of the two transcripts. We found that K-Ras4A was widely expressed in 30 of 30 human cancer cell lines and amounts equal to K-Ras4B in 17 human colorectal tumors. Using splice variant-specific antibodies, we detected K-Ras4A protein in several tumor cell lines at a level equal to or greater than that of K-Ras4B. In addition to the CAAX motif, the C terminus of K-Ras4A contains a site of palmitoylation as well as a bipartite polybasic region. Although both were required for maximal efficiency, each of these could independently deliver K-Ras4A to the plasma membrane. Thus, among four Ras proteins, K-Ras4A is unique in possessing a dual membrane-targeting motif. We also found that, unlike K-Ras4B, K-Ras4A does not bind to the cytosolic chaperone δ-subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase type 6 (PDE6δ). We conclude that efforts to develop anti-K-Ras drugs that interfere with membrane trafficking will have to take into account the distinct modes of targeting of the two K-Ras splice variants.
