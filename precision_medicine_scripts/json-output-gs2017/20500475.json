QOL was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire.\nThe total score for HR-QOL of primary and junior school children with type 1 diabetes was significantly higher than that of those with type 2 diabetes and healthy controls. However, there were no significant differences in high school children. Some subscales regarding HR-QOL were significantly lower for children with type 2 diabetes than for children with type 1 diabetes or healthy controls. The DR-QOL of children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes did not significantly differ. The Family Burden and Family Involvement were significantly greater in parents of children with type 1 diabetes. There were significantly positive correlations between HR-QOL and DR-QOL in both groups. In type 1 diabetes only, there were significant negative correlations between glycated hemoglobin and some subscales of the HR-QOL and QOL of parents of children with diabetes, and weak positive correlation between glycated hemoglobin and Family Burden.\nThe HR-QOL of school children with type 1 diabetes was higher than that of those with type 2 diabetes and healthy school children. The QOL of school children with type 1 diabetes was not impaired.","title":"Health-related and diabetes-related quality of life in Japanese children and adolescents with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","pubmedId":"20500475"}
