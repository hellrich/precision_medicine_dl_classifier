Tissue from the 25 patients with tumors greater than 10 cm in diameter were collected and DNA was extracted. Exons 9, 11, and 13 of the C-kit gene were analyzed and the mutations compared with the clinical and pathological characteristics of the corresponding tumors.\nOf the 25 tumors studied, 16 had C-kit gene mutations and nine did not. Of the 16 with mutations, there were four with exon 9 mutations, 12 with exon 11 mutations, and none with exon 13 mutations. Gene mutations were more frequent in male than female patients (12/13, 92% vs 4/12, 33%). There were no significant differences in age, resectability, recurrence rate, tumor characteristics (ulceration, necrosis, hemorrhage and mitotic counts), or survival in patients with or without gene mutations.\nC-kit gene mutations were frequently found in patients with large GIST, more commonly in men than in women. However, the presence of a mutation was not predictive of prognosis in patients with large GIST.","title":"Clinical implications of C-kit gene mutation in patients with large gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"16928224"}
