And the immunohistochemical S-P method was employed for detecting the protein expressions of BRCA1 and BRCA2.\nBRCA1 expression in breast cancer, breast cancer adjacent cancer tissues and positive rates in breast hyperplasia were 60.5% (52/86), 46.5% (40/86) and 100% (48/48). The difference was significant among three groups. The BRCA2 expression in breast cancer, breast cancer adjacent cancer tissues and positive rates in breast hyperplasia were 41.9% (36/86), 55.8% (48/86) and 95.8% (46/48) respectively. And the difference was significant among three groups. The expression of BRCA1 had no obvious relation with BRCA2 protein in breast cancer tissues (r \u003d 0.673, P \u003e 0.05).\nThe aberrant expressions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein plays a major role in the occurrence and progression of sporadic breast cancer.","title":"[Significance and expressions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein in sporadic breast cancer].","pubmedId":"25622745"}
