Although EML4-ALK is reported to be formed by inversion of chromosome 2, other mechanisms of this gene fusion remain unknown. This study aimed to examine the mechanism of EML4-ALK rearrangement using a novel cell line with the EML4-ALK fusion gene.\nAn EML4-ALK-positive cell line, termed JFCR-LC649, was established from pleomorphic carcinoma, a rare subtype of NSCLC. We investigated the chromosomal aberrations using fluorescence in situ hybridization and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Alectinib/CH5424802, a selective ALK inhibitor, was evaluated in the antitumor activity against JFCR-LC649 in vitro and in vivo xenograft model.\nWe established an EML4-ALK-positive cell line, termed JFCR-LC649, derived from a patient with NSCLC and revealed that the JFCR-LC649 cells harbor variant 3 of the EML4-ALK fusion with twofold copy number gain. Interestingly, comparative genomic hybridization and metaphase-fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that in addition to two normal chromosome 2, JFCR-LC649 cells contained two aberrant chromosome 2 that were fragmented and scattered. These observations provided the first evidence that EML4-ALK fusion in JFCR-LC649 cells was formed in chromosome 2 by a distinct mechanism of genomic rearrangement, termed chromothripsis. Furthermore, a selective ALK inhibitor alectinib/CH5424802 suppressed tumor growth of the JFCR-LC649 cells through inhibition of phospho-ALK in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft model.\nOur results suggested that chromothripsis may be a mechanism of oncogenic rearrangement of EML4-ALK. In addition, alectinib was effective against EML4-ALK-positive tumors with ALK copy number gain mediated by chromothripsis.","title":"A novel mechanism of EML4-ALK rearrangement mediated by chromothripsis in a patient-derived cell line.","pubmedId":"25144242"}
