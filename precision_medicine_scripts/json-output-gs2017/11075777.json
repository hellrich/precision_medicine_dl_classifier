Glioma induction has been previously reported after external beam radiation for leukaemia, pituitary adenoma, tinea capitus, and meningioma. This radiosurgery-induced malignancy may portend further reports of tumour induction. The theoretical risk of tumour induction by low doses of radiation to normal neural tissue after radiosurgery is now confirmed. Reports of additional cases of radiosurgery-induced tumours might temper the use of this increasingly used technique for benign surgically accessible lesions.","title":"Glioblastoma induction after radiosurgery for meningioma.","pubmedId":"11075777"}
