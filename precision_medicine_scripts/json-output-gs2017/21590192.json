Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the tumorigenic activity of tamoxifen may be of great prognostic and therapeutic significance. Our study suggests that tamoxifen treatment and alterations of the K-ras proto-oncogene may occur as parallel events in carcinogenesis of the endometrium.","title":"Endometrial carcinoma in a breast cancer patient treated with tamoxifen.","pubmedId":"21590192"}
