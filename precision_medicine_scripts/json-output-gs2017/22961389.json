Links with predisposition syndrome exists (giant congenital naevus, xeroderma pigmentosum). Diagnosis is often difficult and distinction between benign or malignant lesion is sometime impossible (Spitzoid naevus, melanocytic neoplasms) leading to the diagnosis of \"melanocytic tumor of uncertain malignant potential\" (MELTUMP). Atypical features (amelanotic or raised lesions, atypical histotype) are frequent leading to delay in treatment. Diagnosis and treatment require expertise for pathologists and dermatologists pediatricians. Invasive melanomas are of poor prognosis despite recent progress in adult treatment. Early and rigorous treatment of suspect skin lesions is necessary.","title":"[Melanoma in children: diagnosis and treatment specificities].","pubmedId":"22961389"}
