Increasing attention is being focused on discovering molecular markers for diagnosis and prognosis. Our objective was to evaluate PI3K, Akt and survivin protein expression in gastric cancer, and their correlations with clinicohistological features and prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.\nTissue samples were obtained from 70 patients with gastric cancer patients and 20 patients with normal gastric mucosa. The protein levels of PI3K, Akt and survivin were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Statistical analyses were performed to establish the correlations between their expressions and patients\u0027 clinicopathologic characteristics.\nThe positive expression rates of PI3K, Akt and survivin were significantly higher in the gastric cancer tissues compared to normal gastric mucosa (P\u003c0.05). Expression levels of PI3K, Akt and survivin proteins were significantly correlated with TNM stage, differentiation grade, lymph node metastasis and metastases to other organs (P\u003c0.05). Cooperative relationships were identified between PI3K and Akt, and PI3K and survivin (P\u003c0.01), suggesting the involvement of the PI3K/Akt/survivin signaling pathway in the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer.\nProtein expression of PI3K, Akt and survivin were significantly associated with the development, progression and metastasis of gastric cancer and may have value as diagnostic and prognostic markers in gastric cancer.","title":"Clinicopathological significance of PI3K, Akt and survivin expression in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"24726064"}
