The similarity in patient characteristics significantly associated with EGFR mutations and in those who responded to therapy in BR.21 led to the hypothesis that EGFR mutation status can be used as a predictive marker for response and survival benefit in patients treated with the EGFR TK inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. This review summarizes the available data to date on the frequency and type of EGFR TK domain mutations and their association with clinical features, response, and survival outcome of patients treated with erlotinib and gefitinib.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer: impact of primary or secondary mutations.","pubmedId":"16764754"}
