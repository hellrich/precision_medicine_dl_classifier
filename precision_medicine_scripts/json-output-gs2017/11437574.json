The six female and two male patients ranged in age from 43 to 68 years. Tumours were located at the petroclival region in two, the lateral parasellar region in two, the petrous apex in one and the sphenoid ridge in three patients. On magnetic resonance imaging, they were iso or hypointense on T1-weighted images, and hyper or isointense on T 2-weighted images. Peritumoral brain edema was absent in five cases, and was mild to moderate in three cases. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were measured preoperatively in three patients, with one having an elevated serum CEA level which re turned to normal following tumour resection. Immunohistochemical analysis on the resected tumour tissues, pseudopsammoma bodies and surrounding tumour cells were shown to be CEA-positive. Ultrastructurally, pseudopsammoma bodies were composed of granular and filamentous materials located predominantly in the intracellular lumina, which were lined by microvilli. While these morphological features of focal epithelial and secretory differentiation of tumour cells call attention to the broad spectrum of differentiation properties of meningiomas, the biological behavior of the eight tumours reported herein corresponded to those of meningiomas in general.","title":"Secretory meningioma: clinicopathologic features of eight cases.","pubmedId":"11437574"}
