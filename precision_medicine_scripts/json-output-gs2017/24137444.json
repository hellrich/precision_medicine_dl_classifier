It is the sixth leading cause of mortality from malignant disease in China and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. The poor outcome reflects the requirement for an improved understanding of the transcriptional control of oncogenic signaling pathways. 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is a potent oncogenic driver of PC. The present study aimed to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of microRNA (miR)-375-targeted PDK1. miR-375 is a putative target and, in the present study, was observed to be significantly downregulated in the tumor compared with non-tumor tissues from patients with PC (n\u003d44). As determined by a luciferase reporter assay, the ectopic expression of miR-375 was identified to diminish the transcriptional activity of PDK1. Furthermore, immunoblotting revealed that miR-375 suppressed endogenous PDK1 protein levels. Functional assays showed that miR-375 was able to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of the PC cells. miR-375 is a significant regulator of the PDK1 oncogene, suggesting that it may have a potential therapeutic role in the treatment of PC.","title":"MicroRNA-375 targets the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 gene in pancreatic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24137444"}
