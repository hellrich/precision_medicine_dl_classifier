Cisplatin is an effective radiosensitizer, but its single             agent activity in recurrent cervical cancer is disappointing. Inactivation of             tumor suppressors through ubiquitin-mediated degradation by human papillomavirus             is known to be a critical step in the carcinogenesis of uterine cervix. Bortezomib,             a selective inhibitor of the proteasome, has been shown to inhibit the growth             of several solid tumors. To determine the role of bortezomib in cervical cancer             as a chemotherapeutic agent, we studied its biological properties. Bortezomib             efficiently inhibited the proteasomal activities in cervical cancer cells, and             an increased expression of tumor suppressors such as p53, hDlg and hScrib became             evident. In addition, sequential or concomitant treatment of bortezomib and cisplatin             stimulated the expression of p53, hScrib and p21 and the stimulation was markedly             influenced by the order of drugs in HeLa cells. We further confirmed that the             concomitant use of bortezomib and cisplatin has synergistic inhibitory effects             on the growth of xenograft tumors derived from HeLa cells. Our data establish             the possibility that the concomitant use of bortezomib and cisplatin could be             an alternative choice in cases resistant to conventional chemotherapy, and sequential             effects must be considered for advanced and therapy-resistant cervical cancer             patients.","title":"Sequential effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and chemotherapeutic             agents in uterine cervical cancer cell lines.","pubmedId":"23064281"}
