It metastasizes frequently to liver, peritoneum, and lungs. Colon metastasis is extremely uncommon. We report here a 70-year-old male who was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma for which he underwent a Whipple procedure. Fifteen months later, a CT scan revealed mural thickening in the colon; this was supplemented with a PET scan, which confirmed this mass. Histological diagnosis of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma to the colon was made and the patient was treated with chemotherapy. Although rare, cholangiocarcinoma metastasis can be found in the colon. A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose and treat early. More cases need to be reported to find out further about the prognosis of the disease.
