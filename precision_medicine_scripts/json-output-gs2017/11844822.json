The Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations 185delAG and 5382insC (BRCA1) were found in 10 families (6.1%). However, 6174delT (BRCA2) was found in only one family (0.6%) despite estimates of equal frequency in the Ashkenazi population. In contrast to other series, the average age of breast cancer diagnosis was earlier in BRCA2 mutation carriers (32.1 years) than in women with BRCA1 mutations (37.6 years, P \u003d.028). BRCA1 mutations were detected in 20 (45.5%) of 44 families with ovarian cancer and 12 (75%) of 16 families with both breast and ovarian cancer in a single individual. Significantly fewer BRCA2 mutations (two [4.5%] of 44) were detected in families with ovarian cancer (P \u003d.01). Eight families had male breast cancer; one had a BRCA1 mutation and three had BRCA2 mutations.\nBRCA1 mutations were three times more prevalent than BRCA2 mutations. Breast cancer diagnosis before 50 years of age, ovarian cancer, breast and ovarian cancer in a single individual, and male breast cancer were all significantly more common in families with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, but none of these factors distinguished between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Evidence for reduced breast cancer penetrance associated with the BRCA2 mutation 6174delT was noted.","title":"BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation frequency in women evaluated in a breast cancer risk evaluation clinic.","pubmedId":"11844822"}
