Univariate and multivariate analysis of relapse-free survival (RFS) was conducted in relation to tumours\u0027 clinicopathologic features and genotype.\nMutations were found in 351 (82.2%) cases, including 296 (69.3%) KIT and 55 (12.9%) PDGFRA isoforms. Univariate analysis revealed higher 5-year RFS rate in women (37.9%; P \u003d 0.028) and in patients with gastric tumours (46.3%; P \u003c 0.001). In addition a better 5-year RFS correlated with smaller tumour size ≤ 5 cm (62.7%; P \u003c 0.001), tumours with mitotic index ≤ 5/50 high-power fields (60%; P \u003c 0.001), and characterised by (very) low/moderate risk (70.2%; P \u003d 0.006). Patients with GISTs bearing deletions encompassing KIT codons 557/558 had worse 5-year RFS rate (23.8%) than those with any other KIT exon 11 mutations (41.8%; P \u003c 0.001) or deletions not involving codons 557/558 (33.3%; P \u003d 0.007). Better 5-year RFS characterised patients with KIT exon 11 point mutations (50.7%) or duplications (40%). By multivariate analysis, tumours with PDGFRA mutations and KIT exon 11 point mutations/other than 557/558 deletions had lower risk of progression than with KIT exon 11 557/558 deletions (both Ps \u003d 0.001).\nKIT/PDGFRA mutational status has prognostic significance for patients\u0027 outcome and may help in management of patients with GISTs.","title":"Prognostic value of KIT/PDGFRA mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST): Polish Clinical GIST Registry experience.","pubmedId":"21527588"}
