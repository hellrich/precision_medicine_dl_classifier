To explore the potential use of p53 in gene therapy for cervical cancer, we introduced wild-type p53 into cervical cancer cell lines via a recombinant adenoviral vector, Ad5CMV-p53, and analyzed its effects on cell and tumor growth. The transduction efficiencies of all cell lines were 100% at a multiplicity of infection of 100 or greater. The p53 protein was detected in Ad5CMV-p53-infected cells. Protein expression peaked at day 3 after infection and lasted 15 days. The Ad5CMV-p53-infected cells underwent apoptosis, and cell growth was greatly suppressed. The Ad5CMV-p53 treatment significantly reduced the volumes of established s.c. tumors in vivo. These results indicate that transfection of cervical cancer cells with the wild-type p53 gene via Ad5CMV-p53 is a potential novel approach to the therapy of cervical cancer.","title":"Adenovirus-mediated transfer of a wild-type p53 gene and induction of apoptosis in cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"8674061"}
