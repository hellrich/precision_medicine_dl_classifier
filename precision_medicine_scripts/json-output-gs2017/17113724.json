Mutations in BRCA2 are mainly point mutations in contrast to BRCA1 in which large genomic rearrangements are quite common. In recent literature, however, genomic alterations of BRCA2 have been linked especially to male breast cancer families. We wanted to screen large genomic deletions and duplications of BRCA2 among Finnish male breast cancer patients.\nWe used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to detect large genomic rearrangements in the BRCA2 gene among 36 unselected Finnish male breast cancer patients previously tested and found negative for Finnish BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations.\nNo genomic mutations of BRCA2 nor CHEK2*1100delC point mutations, also included in the assay, were found in this study.\nLarge genomic BRCA2 rearrangements were not found among our 36 Finnish male breast cancer patients. Screening of large BRCA2 rearrangements is not likely to be advantageous in Finland.","title":"Large genomic BRCA2 rearrangements and male breast cancer.","pubmedId":"17113724"}
