One of the key components of this pathway is the serine/threonine protein kinase, Raf. The Raf family kinases (A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf) have been intensively studied since being identified in the early 1980s as retroviral oncogenes, especially with respect to the discovery of activating mutations of B-Raf in a large number of tumors which led to intensified efforts to develop drugs targeting Raf kinases. This also resulted in a rapid increase in our knowledge of the biological functions of the B-Raf and C-Raf isoforms, which may in turn be contrasted with the little that is known about A-Raf. The biological functions of A-Raf remain mysterious, although it appears to share some of the basic properties of the other two isoforms. Recently, emerging evidence has begun to reveal the functions of A-Raf, of which some are kinase-independent. These include the inhibition of apoptosis by binding to MST2, acting as safeguard against oncogenic transformation by suppressing extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation and playing a role in resistance to Raf inhibitors. In this review, we discuss the regulation of A-Raf protein expression, and the roles of A-Raf in apoptosis and cancer, with a special focus on its role in resistance to Raf inhibitors. We also describe the scaffold functions of A-Raf and summarize the unexpected complexity of Raf signaling.","title":"A-Raf: A new star of the family of raf kinases.","pubmedId":"26508523"}
