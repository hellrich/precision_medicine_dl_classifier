Because early diagnosis and treatment improves prognosis, clinicians need to include it as a possible diagnosis when evaluating a pigmented lesion in a pediatric patient. Some risk factors for melanoma include xeroderma pigmentosum, giant congenital melanocytic nevi, dysplastic nevus syndrome, atypical nevi, many acquired melanocytic nevi, family history of melanoma, and immunosuppression. Definitive treatment is with surgical excision. Adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy can be used in advanced cases.","title":"Childhood melanoma.","pubmedId":"19880040"}
