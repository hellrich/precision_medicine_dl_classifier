Preclinical studies demonstrated that targeting FGFR could lead to antitumor effects. Lucitanib is a multikinase inhibitor targeting FGFR1-2, VEGFR1-3 and PDGFRA/B. In the phase I trial testing lucitanib continuous dosing, 6 objective responses were observed in 12 evaluable patients presenting with FGFR1 and/or FGF3-4-19 (11q) amplification. Based on this, a phase II trial has been initiated.   Methods:  This is a phase II trial testing the efficacy of lucitanib 15 mg daily in patients with ER+/HER2-  metastatic BC who have received at least first line endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting. After informed consent, a biopsy of metastatic site is required to assess the presence of FGFR1- and/or 11q- amplification, which will be centrally evaluated using FISH. Testing could be also performed on archived metastatic biopsies. The primary objective is to evaluate the ORR of single agent lucitanib in metastatic BC patients with FGFR1-amplified, FGFR1-non-amplified with neither FGFR1- amplification nor 11q- amplification. Secondary objectives include clinical benefit rate, PFS, safety, pharmacokinetics and exploratory biomarker analyses. A Simon two-stage design will be used for each of the cohorts to test the null hypothesis that the ORR is 5% or less vs 20% using a one-sided test with 5% level of significance and 90% power. In each cohort separately, an initial 21 patients with measurable disease at baseline will be assessed at the end of stage 1. If at least 2 patients respond per the pre-specified criteria, this cohort will accrue additional 20 patients. The null hypothesis will be rejected if there are at least 5 responders among all 41 patients. The trial started in December 2013. It is planned to open in 9 countries and 30 centers. As of January 24, 5 patients have been screened, 1 of them in the FGFR1-amplified arm.  Conclusion: FINESSE is a phase II trial testing lucitanib, a multikinase inhibitor, in three selected populations in order to define the efficacy of the drug and the predictive value of FGFR1 or 11q amplifications.
