Liver metastases of the breast cancer could be excluded histologically, however, serologic testing for echinococcosis was negative. After contrast-enhanced sonography and because of the complex B-mode appearance of the liver lesions, cystic echinococcosis was suspected. This could be verified histologically after hemihepatectomy.","title":"[Female patient with unclear liver lesions after breast cancer.
