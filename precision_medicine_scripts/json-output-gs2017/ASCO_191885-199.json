Simultaneous assessment for genetic alterations provides biomarkers to assist clinicians in their treatment selections. Methods: A total of 43 FFPE (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) samples obtained from lung cancer patients in Taiwan were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS), using a compact panel encompassing 17 potentially actionable, lung cancer-associated genes. NGS was performed on the Ion Torrent PGM or Proton System with a targeted average depth of \u003e 800x. Genomic alterations detected were categorized as single nucleotide variants (SNV) or chromosomal copy number alterations (CNA). Results: A total of 74 putatively actionable genomic alterations were detected across 38 patients (88.4%), which may predict sensitivity or resistance to established and/or therapies that are still in clinical development. 19 patients (44.2%) had tumors harboring activating EGFR mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain  L858R substitution or exon 19 deletion, which may suggest clinical benefit to first- and second-generation EGFR TK inhibitors (TKIs). Three patients (7.0%) whose tumor had acquired the EGFR T790M mutation were advised to switch to third-generation EGFR TKI. Possible resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs via increased copy number of EGFR (14.0%, n \u003d 6) and MET (11.6%, n \u003d 5) were observed. Deletion or loss of CDKN2A gene were detected in 14 patients (32.6%), which may confer sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Inhibition of downstream effectors in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways were suggested for patients whose tumor harbored PIK3CA and/or KRAS oncogenic mutations. Conclusions: Next-generation sequencing using a compact panel of genes may be sufficient to identify biomarkers for targeted therapies selection for most lung cancer patients in Taiwan.","title":"Targeted gene sequencing panel for identifying actionable genomic alterations in Taiwanese lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_191885-199"}
