We hypothesized that cHCC-CC patients had poorer overall survival (OS) than HCC patients after liver transplantation.\nPatients with localized HCC and cHCC-CC treated with surgical resection or transplant were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Database (1973-2007). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine survival.\nWe identified 3,378 (1,447 [43%] transplant, 1,931 [57%] resection) patients with HCC, and 54 (19 [35%] transplant, 35 [65%] resection) patients with cHCC-CC. Patients undergoing resection of HCC and cHCC-CC had similar 3-year OS (55% vs. 46%, P \u003d 0.4). Three-year OS of patients undergoing transplant was significantly greater for HCC (78%) than for cHCC-CC (48%, P \u003d 0.01). In adjusted models, patients transplanted for cHCC-CC had higher hazard of death compared to HCC patients (HR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2-5.1, P \u003d 0.01).\nTransplantation for localized cHCC-CC confers a survival benefit similar to liver resection for cHCC-CC, but inferior to transplantation for HCC. With survival data that mimics historic reports of transplant for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, this study questions the benefit of transplantation for patients with cHCC-CC.","title":"Transplantation versus resection for patients with combined hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23386397"}
