Previous reports have also suggested increased sensitivity of ALK+ NSCLC to the chemotherapeutic agent pemetrexed. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a candidate predictive biomarker for pemetrexed activity. Here we report analysis of the Response Genetics Inc. (RGI) database for this association and implications for therapy. Methods: ALK fusion was identified by a novel RT-PCR assay (Danenberg et al: ASCO 2010). For TS, RNA from microdissected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors was analyzed as previously described, reported as the ratio of gene expression to -actin. For reference, a TS level \u003c2.33 is the cutpoint for sensitivity. Results: TS levels were available from 63 ALK+ patients and 1,698 ALK- control lung adenocarcinoma patients. All ALK+ patients had  adenocarcinomas without EGFR or KRAS mutations. Median age: 59.0 (range 33-88), gender (male/female) 32/31 (51%/49%). Median TS RNA level in ALK+ patients was 2.02, range (0.55-19.44), and in ALK- patients was 3.32 (0.36-53.51), p\u003c0.0001 (Mann-Whitney test). The majority of ALK+ patients (N\u003d43, 68%) had a TS level \u003c2.33 cutpoint, compared to only 32% of ALK- patients (N\u003d551,  p\u003c0.0001). Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates relatively low TS gene expression in ALK+ patient tumors as determined by RT-PCR. These data provide a mechanism of action supportive of pemetrexed sensitivity for ALK+ NSCLC.TS expressionNMedian95% CIRangeMean95% CIp valueALK+ patients632.021.60-2.110.55-19.442.531.89-3.16\u003c0.0001ALK- patients16983.323.15-3.450.36-53.517.871.68-14.05","title":"Thymidylate synthase (TS) gene expression in patients with ALK positive (+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Implications for therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_95369-114"}
