Shortening with aging could be demonstrated for both normal and cancer tissues; regression analysis showed rates for length reduction of 44 and 50 base pair/year, respectively. Straight, essentially parallel, lines were obtained for the two cases, normal tissue values being about 2 kilobase pairs (kbp) higher, with a significant correlation between data at the individual patient level.","title":"Correlation of telomere lengths in normal and cancers tissue in the large bowel.","pubmedId":"10960768"}
