The antitumor activity was evaluated by determining the ratio of the maximum tolerated dose of each drug to the 70% tumor growth inhibitory concentration in a colony assay. Cisplatin was the most potent agent, followed by 254-S and carboplatin. DWA2114R and NK121 were less potent than cisplatin and 254-S. Cross-resistance to adriamycin was also investigated using an adriamycin-resistant small cell lung cancer subline, SBC -3/ADM30. SBC-3/ADM30 was 1.7- to 4.0-fold more resistant to cisplatin, carboplatin, NK121, and DWA2114R, than was the parent line, SBC-3, and the subline was 2.0-fold more sensitive to 254-S. Using SBC-3, in vitro combination effects of etoposide and cisplatin, carboplatin, or 254-S were evaluated by the median-effect principle. Synergism was noted when cisplatin and etoposide were combined at a fixed molar ratio of 1:1. Combination of carboplatin and etoposide showed an additive effect. The combination of 254-S and etoposide was antagonistic at low concentrations, but was markedly synergistic at higher concentrations. These data suggested the efficacy of 254-S in the treatment of lung cancer.","title":"Antitumor activity of platinum analogs against human lung cancer cell lines and tumor specimens.","pubmedId":"8213217"}
