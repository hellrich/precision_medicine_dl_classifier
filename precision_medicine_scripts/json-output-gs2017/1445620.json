Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of mRNA was used to amplify the c-Ki-ras-2 and p53 genes from Syrian golden hamsters. The PCR products were confirmed by predicted-size analysis, probing with nonradioactive (biotin-labeled) oligonucleotides, and direct sequencing. Lung tumors were produced in hamsters by repeated injections of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). Of six tumors examined, three (50%) had mutations in codon 12 of Ki-ras. Examination of the conserved regions of p53 revealed no mutations. We conclude that NNK-induced carcinogenesis in the hamster results in characteristic alterations of Ki-ras but may not necessarily involve the p53 gene.","title":"Mutational analysis of a dominant oncogene (c-Ki-ras-2) and a tumor suppressor gene (p53) in hamster lung tumorigenesis.","pubmedId":"1445620"}
