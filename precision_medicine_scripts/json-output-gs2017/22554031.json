Several publications have reported on the feasibility of robot-assisted laparoscopy in early cervical cancer. Herein is reported the case of a woman with locally advanced cervical cancer that was successfully treated using neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by total robotic type C1 radical hysterectomy (TRRH) plus pelvic lymphadenectomy. The success of this approach, which is not the standard of care in this disease, suggests that additional studies should be performed in a selected population.","title":"Robotic radical hysterectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"22554031"}
