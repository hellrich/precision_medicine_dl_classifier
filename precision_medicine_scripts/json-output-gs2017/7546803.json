There were 75 men and 4 women with a mean age of 65 years (range 52-77). Cardiac procedures consisted of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 69 patients (three redos), aortic valve replacement in 7 (2 combined with CABG), mitral valve repair in 1 (combined with CABG) and other in 2. In CABG cases the mean number of distal anastomoses was 4.0. Pulmonary resection included bilateral lobectomy in 1 patient, sleeve lobectomy in 3, pneumonectomy in 6, bilobectomy in 5, lobectomy in 60 and segmental resection in 4. Postoperatively 52 patients were stage I (65.8%), 18 stage II (22.8%) and 9 stage III a. Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 48 patients (61%) and adenocarcinoma in 24 patients (30%). The hospital mortality was 6.3% (n \u003d 5). Re-exploration for bleeding was necessary in seven patients. Follow-up was complete for all patients. The estimated mean survival for all patients (including hospital deaths) was 58 months. Two- and five-year survival rates were 62% and 42% with 45 and 22 patients, respectively, under surveillance. Lung cancer accounted for 64% of the late deaths. We conclude that pulmonary resection for lung cancer in patients undergoing a concomitant cardiac operation can be performed safely with low operative morbidity and mortality and good long-term survival.","title":"Concomitant open heart surgery and pulmonary resection for lung cancer.","pubmedId":"7546803"}
