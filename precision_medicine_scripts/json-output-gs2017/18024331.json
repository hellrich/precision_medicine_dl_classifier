It was found that 13.8% of the cases were positive for erbB-3. Expression of erbB-3 was inversely correlated with EGFR and erbB-4 expression (P \u003d .012 and P \u003d .046). Expression of erbB-3 was correlated with positive estrogen and progesterone receptor status and inversely correlated with histologic grade. Expression of erbB-3 was correlated with longer disease-free survival (DFS; P \u003d .028). Within the erbB-3-expressing group, there was a tendency for the coexpressing group to have shorter DFS compared with the single-expressing group. This study revealed that erbB-3 expression was associated with better prognosis. In an era of personalized targeted therapy, erbB-3 expression and its coexpressive pattern with other EGFR family members could be an important determinant for therapeutic plans for breast cancer treatment.","title":"Correlated expression of erbB-3 with hormone receptor expression and favorable clinical outcome in invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast.","pubmedId":"18024331"}
