Radiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with brain metastases. Surgical resection should be considered in patients with isolated brain metastasis and no extracranial disease. The role of chemotherapy in breast cancer brain metastases is not clearly defined; the results of the 8 trials found in the literature are reported. Most experience has been gained with the CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil) and PE (cisplatin and etoposide) regimens; here the median survival of 6 months is similar to radiotherapy. The blood-brain barrier, maintained by tight endothelial junctions and active transport mechanisms, is a major reason for the lower activity of most chemotherapeutic agents compared to other sites of metastatic disease. Most substances with good penetration of the blood-brain barrier have limited activity against breast cancer and some of the most active substances in breast cancer - including doxorubicine, the taxanes and trastuzumab - appear not to reach the central nervous system in sufficient concentrations. Approaches to overcome the blood-brain barrier are still experimental, and more research is clearly needed to identify chemotherapeutic agents both active in breast cancer and with good penetration of the blood-brain barrier. With the exception of patients with resectable brain metastases, danger of cranial herniation or poor general condition, chemotherapy should be offered to breast cancer patients with brain metastases that have progressive extracranial metastatic disease or relapse after radiotherapy.","title":"Chemotherapy for breast cancer brain metastases.","pubmedId":"12415203"}
