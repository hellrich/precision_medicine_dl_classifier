(2012) report the largest study to date on the association between MC1R variants and BRAF mutant melanoma. Although they did not observe a significant overall correlation, there was a significant negative association between BRAF and MC1R mutations for head/neck melanomas. This suggests a fundamental difference in pathogenesis between head/neck and truncal melanomas, which could contribute to their divergent prognoses.","title":"BRAF and MC1R in melanoma: different in head and neck tumors?","pubmedId":"23486431"}
