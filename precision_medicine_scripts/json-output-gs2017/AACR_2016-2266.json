While initially responsive to radiation and chemotherapy, SCLC is characterized by eventual progression and resistance to traditional therapy. We retrospectively analyzed a molecular profiling (MP) database to identify potentially actionable alterations using a multi-platform approach which includes massively parallel sequencing. Experimental Procedures: SCLC patient samples were referred to a central CLIA laboratory (Caris Life Sciences, AZ) for MP (immunohistochemistry [IHC] and next generation sequencing [NGS]). Expression of PD1 (MRQ-22, 1+) on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PDL1 (130021, SP142, 2+5%) in tumor cells was performed by IHC. Additional IHC (ERCC1, TOPO1) and NGS on 591 genes was performed on FFPE samples using the Illumina NextSeq platform in a subset of patient samples. All variants were detected with \u003e 99% confidence. Variants are described as follows: pathogenic, presumed pathogenic, variants of unknown significance and unclassified variants (excluding SNPs). Results: 203 SCLC samples were identified, 48% were females (97) and 52% were males (106). Median age was 65 [range: 29-88]. Cancer cells expressed PDL1 in 2.5% of cases (5/203) and PD1+ TILs were detected in 38% (75/197). For comparison, internal PDL1+ in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) was 31% (339/1098). Notable findings from IHC included ERCC1 negative status in 93% (14/15) and TOPO1 + in 70% (14/20). CNV and mutational analysis (NGS) was available for 10 and 22 patients, respectively. Amplifications were found in the following genes: CCND3, CRKL, FGF4, FGFR1 and NFKB1A (n \u003d 1, respectively), and CCND1, CCNE1, CDKN2A and FGF3 (n \u003d 2, respectively). As previously reported, the most frequently altered genes were TP53 (73%) and RB1 (68%). Clinically relevant pathogenic or presumed pathogenic variants included: EGFR (exon 19 deletion), BRAF (G469A), APC (T1556fs), NF1 (A1610fs, D699fs), NOTCH1 (E473fs, C332Y, G546X) and PTCH1 (N1351fs). It was thought the patient with EGFR mutation is a case of NSCLC transformation to SCLC. Variants with unknown significance or unclassified variants detected in genes with clinical relevance and of potential interest for targeted therapy in SCLC include: DDR2, cMET, RET, FGFR1/3, BRCA2, IGF1R, RICTOR and NTRK1. Conclusion: Genomic and molecular characterization of SCLC samples reveals a heterogeneous population. Several potentially actionable targets are identified by NGS. Early reported trial data suggests susceptibility of SCLC to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We observed higher levels of PD1+ TILs, however differences in antibody clones, thresholds or staining localization (tumor cells vs. stromal lymphocytes), may account for the observed overall low PD-L1 expression. Further efforts are needed to identify and validate new therapeutic targets in SCLC.","title":"Molecular and genomic characterization of SCLC","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2266"}
