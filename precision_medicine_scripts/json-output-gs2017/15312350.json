Multiple clinical parameters and survival were analyzed.\nThe expression of FASE, HER-2/neu, bcl-2 and p53 was 29.8%, 40.5%, 33.3% and 39.3%, respectively. The local recurrence and bone-metastasis rate were higher in FASE positive patients than in negative patients (28.0% vs 10.2%, P \u003d 0.05; 61.5% vs 23.9%, P \u003d 0.017, respectively). The 5-year survival rate was lower in HER-2/neu and FASE positive patients than in negative patients (37.7% vs 67.7%, P \u003d 0.0083; 35.1% vs 66.1%, P \u003d 0.0079, respectively), which showed that HER-2/neu and FASE expression were associated with significantly poor survival. Patients whose tumors were both HER-2/neu and FASE negative had better outcome, with a 5-year survival rate of 78.2%, compared with 36.3% in those whose tumors were positive for either one (P \u003d 0.002). However, bcl-2 and p53 were not independent prognostic factors for survival.\nHER-2/neu and FASE are independent prognostic factor in stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients who expressed one or both markers.","title":"[Prognostic value of expression of FASE, HER-2/neu, bcl-2 and p53 in stage I non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"15312350"}
