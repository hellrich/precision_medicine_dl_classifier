Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by the HADS scale (Hospital Anxiety And Depression Scale) validated in Russia.\nClinically significant symptoms of anxiety ( more or equal 11 HADS) were present in 33 and 38%, of depression - in 30 and 38% of patients with IHD and AH, respectively. Presence of clinically manifested depression at initial examination increased 1.59 times combined risk of nonfatal and fatal cases (odds ratio [OR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-1.96, p\u003d0.0001), 1.64 times - risk of cardiovascular death (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.20-2.24, p\u003d0.0021), and 1.82 times - risk of death from all causes (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.41-2.34, p\u003d0.0001). It is known that for somatic patients crossover of anxiety and depression symptoms is typical (simultaneous presence of some symptoms of anxiety and depression). Total HADS score equal to 11 or more increased risk of all cause death (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.08-1.84, p\u003d0.0111), as well as fatal and nonfatal events (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08-1.65, p\u003d0.0089).\nTaking into consideration negative effect of depressive symptoms on prognosis it is recommended to screen patients with IHD in the first place those who have had myocardial infarction and brain stroke with the aim of detection of depression and anxiety depressive symptoms and subsequent their adequate correction.","title":"[Depressive symptoms worsen cardiovascular prognosis and shorten length of life in patients with arterial hypertension and ischemic heart disease].","pubmedId":"21627600"}
