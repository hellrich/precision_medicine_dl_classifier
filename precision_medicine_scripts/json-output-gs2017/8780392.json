We investigated the incidence of ras oncogene mutation in human cutaneous melanoma in connection to sun-exposed body sites in the patient, using a large series of DNA samples derived from paraffin-embedded material as well as from fresh tumor samples and cell lines. We first show that, of the ras family, predominantly N-ras is activated (15%), whereas rarely H-ras or K-ras are mutated. The occurrence of N-ras mutations correlates with continuous exposure to sunlight of the primary tumor site. Of all tumors initiated on chronically sun-exposed body sites, 26% contained mutated N-ras, in contrast to 0% of sun-protected melanomas. Melanoma lesions obtained from patients from North or Central Europe contained fewer N-ras mutations (12%) as compared with patients from Australia (24%). Mutations were specifically associated with nodular melanoma and to a lesser extent with lentigo malignant melanoma. N-ras mutations did not correlate with metastasis or survival parameters. This study identifies a subset of cutaneous melanomas that contain in the primary lesion ultraviolet-induced N-ras mutations, which are maintained through further progression.","title":"Relevance of ultraviolet-induced N-ras oncogene point mutations in development of primary human cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"8780392"}
