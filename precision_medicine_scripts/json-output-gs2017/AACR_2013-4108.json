Despite surgical removal followed by concomitant radiation and chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), GB tumors develop treatment resistance and recur, invading brain tissue. Impaired response to treatment occurs rapidly conferring a median survival of just fifteen months. Thus, it is necessary to identify the genetic and signaling mechanisms that promote tumor resistance and spread in order to develop targeted therapies to combat this refractory setting. Our lab has previously published a role for the TWEAK-Fn14 ligand-receptor system in GB cell invasiveness and survival. Here we report that SGEF, a RhoG specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), is overexpressed in GB tumors and we hypothesize that SGEF plays an important role in promoting TWEAK-Fn14 mediated glioma invasion and survival. We show that upon TWEAK binding to Fn14, SGEF is recruited to the Fn14 cytoplasmic tail. The Fn14-SGEF interaction requires TRAF2 recruitment and leads to activation of Rac1. Importantly, SGEF mRNA expression is elevated in TMZ-resistant primary GB tumor grafts compared to those with known TMZ sensitivity. SGEF mRNA and protein expression are regulated by the TWEAK-Fn14 signaling axis in an NF-B dependent manner and inhibition of SGEF expression via shRNA shutdown sensitizes glioma cells to TMZ-induced apoptosis and impairs colony formation following TMZ insult. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of SGEF depleted GB cells revealed impaired expression of a network of DNA repair and survival genes including ATM, ATR, BRCA2, and XIAP among others, as well as increased expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BAD. Understanding the role of SGEF in promoting chemotherapeutic resistance may direct the development of novel targeted therapeutics for TMZ refractory, invasive GB cells.","title":"SGEF is overexpressed in glioblastoma and mediates TWEAK-Fn14 induced cell survival.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-4108"}
