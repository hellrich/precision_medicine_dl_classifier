In those cases, it is difficult to distinguish primary lung cancer (PLC) from lung metastasis. Therefore, both local therapy for a single lung lesions and systemic therapy for micrometastases are needed. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of concurrent stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and chemotherapy in patients with metachronous PLC.\nWe reviewed the records of 10 patients with metachronous PLC treated with SBRT and concurrent chemotherapy with curative intent from 2007 to 2013. The delivered radiation dose was 48 Gy in four fractions.\nAll patients received SBRT with concurrent chemotherapy on schedule. Complete response rate was 90%. Safety profile of this treatment was compatible with that of traditional chemoradiotherapy.\nOur study showed good feasibility and safety for SBRT with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.","title":"A new strategy for metachronous primary lung cancer: stereotactic body radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"25964602"}
