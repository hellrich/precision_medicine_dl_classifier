The specific BAC clones were used to isolate and purify the corresponding genomic DNA, which were labeled with biotin or DIG by nick translation into dual color probes. 18q21 LOH was assessed by dual-color FISH in 30 cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis. All samples were 10% formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. The relationship between 18q21 LOH and clinicopathologic characteristics was analyzed.\nAmong 30 cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 25 cases showed LOH at the region RP11-729G3 (83.3%), and 26 cases showed LOH at the region RP11-850A17 (86.6%). Among these, 25 cases with LOH at both regions, 1 case showed LOH only at the region of RP11-850A17. No LOH was found in 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis.\n18q21 LOH is a high-frequency event in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. LOH at the regions RP11-729G3 and RP11-850A17 demonstrates a high concordance. 18q21 may play an important role during pancreatic carcinogenesis and tumor progression. 18q21 LOH may be used as a diagnostic marker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","title":"[Fluorescence in-situ hybrydization detection of 18q21 LOH in human pancreatic ductal carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis].","pubmedId":"19094706"}
