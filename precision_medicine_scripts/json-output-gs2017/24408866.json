Lack of specific symptoms and availability of early diagnostic markers account for late diagnosis of CCA. Surgical treatment is a gold standard choice but few patients are candidates and local recurrence after surgery is high. Benefit of systemic chemotherapy is limited; hence, better treatment options are required. The differences in etiology, anatomical positions and pathology make it difficult to generalize all CCA subtypes for a single treatment regimen. Herein, we review the uniqueness of molecular profiling identified by multiple approaches, for example, serial analysis of gene expression, exome sequencing, transcriptomics/proteomics profiles, protein kinase profile, etc., that provide the opportunity for treatment of liver fluke-associated CCA. Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulator/immunosuppressor, epidermal growth factor receptor or platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitors, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, IL6 antagonist, nuclear factor-κB inhibitor, histone modulator, proteasome inhibitor as well as specific inhibitors suggested from various study approaches, such as MetAP2 inhibitor, 1,25(OH)2 D3 and cyclosporine A are suggested in this review for the treatments of this specific CCA subtype. This might provide an alternative treatment option for CCA patients; however, clinical trials in this specific CCA group are required.
