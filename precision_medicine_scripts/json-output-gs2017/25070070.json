Here, we investigated API5 expression in cervical cancer, its clinical significance, and its relationship with phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (pERK1/2) in development and progression of cervical cancer.\nAPI5 effects on cell growth were assessed in cervical cancer cell lines. API5 and pERK1/2 immunohistochemical staining were performed on a cervical cancer tissue microarray consisting of 173 primary cervical cancers, 306 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CINs), and 429 matched normal tissues.\nAPI5 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and colony formation in CaSki cells, whereas API5 knockdown inhibited the both properties in HeLa cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed that API5 expression increased during the normal to tumor transition of cervical carcinoma (P \u003c 0.001), and this increased expression was significantly associated with tumor stage (P \u003d 0.004), tumor grade (P \u003c 0.001), and chemo-radiation response (P \u003d 0.004). API5 expression levels were positively associated with pERK1/2 in cervical cancer (P \u003c 0.001) and high grade CIN (P \u003d 0.031). In multivariate analysis, API5+ (P \u003d 0.039) and combined API5+/pERK1/2+ (P \u003d 0.032) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival.\nAPI5 expression is associated with pERK1/2 in a subset of cervical cancer patients and its expression predicts poor overall survival, supporting that API5 may be a promising novel target for therapeutic interventions.","title":"Apoptosis inhibitor-5 overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"25070070"}
