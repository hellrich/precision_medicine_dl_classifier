The present work utilized the ultrasensitive PCR/RE/LCR mutation assay to detect, identify and determine the prevalence single base substitution mutations in the TP53 and KRAS genes in human sperm. Four disease-associated base sites in the TP53 and KRAS genes, three of which are known to be heritable to live, term offspring, were studied in sperm from eleven human semen specimens. Eight of the specimens (73%) displayed single base substitution mutations, and 30% of all base sites tested were found to harbor mutations ranging in prevalence from 1 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-5) wild type sperm. These germ cell single base substitution mutation frequencies are very similar to somatic tissue TP53 and KRAS mutation frequencies. Equivalent single base mutation frequencies in both germ and somatic cells suggest that there is no unusual selection or mutation protective process operating premeiotically in the germline, and that a selection bias at the level of sperm viability, conception, early cleavage, implantation, and/or embryogenesis operates to exclude the majority of these TP53 mutations and all of the activating KRAS mutations.","title":"Human germline and somatic cells have similar TP53 and Kirsten-RAS gene single base mutation frequencies.","pubmedId":"18418864"}
