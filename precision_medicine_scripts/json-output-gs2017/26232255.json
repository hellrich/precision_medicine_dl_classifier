Therefore, transcriptional induction of p53 target genes can be considered as a global and early indicator of genotoxic stress. By performing expression microarrays and RNA-Seq analysis on wild-type and mutant TP53 human lymphocytes respectively derived from controls and Li-Fraumeni patients and exposed to different classes of genotoxic agents, we first determined a common p53-dependent transcriptional signature of DNA damage. We then derived a simple and fast assay based on the exposure of wild-type TP53 lymphocytes to physical or chemical agents and on the quantitative measurement of selected p53 target gene transcriptional induction. The specificity of the p53 genotoxicity assay can easily be demonstrated by performing the same experiment in control lymphocytes with heterozygous TP53 mutations, which compromise responses to DNA damage. This assay allowed us to show that most of the drugs commonly used in cancer treatment, except the microtubule poisons, are highly genotoxic. The p53 genotoxicity assay should facilitate the measurement of the genotoxic effects of chemical and physical agents and the identification of drugs that are not genotoxic and do not expose patients to the risk of secondary malignancies, especially those with a constitutional defect in response to DNA damage, such as patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
