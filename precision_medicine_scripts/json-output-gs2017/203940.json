Because BKV has oncogenic properties, we have investigated whether it may be a cause of human cancer. Basic principles of tumor virology imply that BKV-induced tumors should contain BKV DNA sequences. Therefore, we assayed (by molecular hybridization) DNA from human tumors and malignant cell lines for BKV DNA, using BKV [(32)P]DNA as probe. The BKV [(32)P]DNA was labeled in vitro (nick translation) to specific activities of 1 to 2 x 10(8) cpm/mug. The BKV DNA used to prepare our probes had the properties expected of authentic BKV genomes, including density of superhelical DNA, sedimentation velocity in alkaline and neutral sucrose gradients, production of one fragment by endonuclease EcoRI cleavage and four fragments by endonuclease Hin II + III cleavage and reassociation properties. From these studies we conclude that our BKV probes hybridized well, and represented bona fide BKV DNA. Using three different BKV [(32)P]DNA probes, i.e., from three distinct plaque isolates, we have analyzed DNA from BKV-transformed cells, normal human tissues, and a large number of human tumors. All human DNAs (cell lines, normal tissues, tumors) hybridized 5% with BKV DNA. Hybridization analysis of BKV-transformed hamster cell DNA indicated 5-6 copies of at least 88% of the BKV genome per cell. No BKV DNA sequences were detected (above the normal 5% hybridization to all human DNAs) in the following normal human tissues: 10 kidney (BKV is usually isolated from urine), 3 spleen, 13 lung, 23 colon, 2 rectum, 1 ileum, and 1 skin. No BKV-specific DNA was found in 166 tumors, including 5 carcinomas (Ca) of stomach, 3 Ca small intestine, 26 Ca colon, 9 Ca rectum, 31 Ca lung, 9 adenocarcinomas and 5 oat cell carcinomas of lung, 17 melanomas, 5 Ca prostate, 4 Ca bladder, 6 Wilms tumors, 4 hypernephromas, 15 Ca kidney, 7 brain tumors, 5 Hodgkin lymphomas, 10 lymphomas (immunosuppressed patients have a high incidence of lymphomas), 2 reticulum cell sarcomas (spleen), and 3 skin tumors. We have also analyzed 7 human malignant cell lines (melanoma, lung, rhabdomyosarcoma, and glioblastomas), including several clones of a lung melanoma line; no BKV DNA sequences were detected. Because our probes could detect one copy of BKV DNA if only 10% of the cells were tumor cells, our results are very strong evidence that the tumors we analyzed did not have a BKV etiology. The tumors we tested represent about 50% of all cancers in the United States; there is no evidence that BKV is involved in the etiology of these types of tumors.","title":"Analysis of human tumors and human malignant cell lines for BK virus-specific DNA sequences.","pubmedId":"203940"}
