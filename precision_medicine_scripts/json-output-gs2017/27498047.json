Previous studies have shown that RACK1 is associated with the progression of multiple cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer. However, the role of RACK1 in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unclear.\nIn this study, the expression of RACK1 was evaluated by Western blot analysis in 8 paired fresh PDAC tissues and immunohistochemistry on 179 paraffin-embedded slices. Then, we used Fisher exact test to analyze the correlation between RACK1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics. Starvation and re-feeding assay was used to assess cell cycle. Western blot, CCK8, flow cytometry assays, and colony formation analyses demonstrated that RACK1 played an essential role in PDAC development. Annexin-V/PI apoptotic assay and western blot showed that RACK1 was involved in regulating the apoptosis of PDAC cells.\nRACK1 was highly expressed in PDAC tissues and cell lines and was significantly associated with multiple clinicopathological factors. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that high RACK1 expression was identified to be an independent prognostic factor for PDAC patients\u0027 survival. In vitro, serum starvation-refeeding experiment suggested that RACK1 was upregulated in proliferating PDAC cells, together with the percentage of cells at the S phase, and was correlated with the expression of Cyclin D1. Moreover, Overexpression of RACK1 facilitated the proliferation and cell cycle progression of PDAC cells, while downregulation of RACK1 induced growth impairment, G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PDAC cells. Silencing RACK1 decreased bcl-2 expression, increased cleaved caspase3 expression level and induced the apoptosis of PDAC cells.\nOur results suggest that RACK1 could play an important role in the tumorigenesis of PDAC and serve as a potential therapeutical target in PDAC treatment.","title":"RACK1 overexpression associates with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma growth and poor prognosis.","pubmedId":"27498047"}
