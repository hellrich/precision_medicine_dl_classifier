There were also distinct differences in the specific types of K-ras and p53 mutations between the two regions. The ratio of G-to-T k-ras transversion mutation (codon 12) relative to wild-type was significantly higher in tumors from the high-pollution region (0.90) than tumors from the non-pollution site (0.28) (P \u003d 0.03). Relative to tumors with wild-type, the ratio of p53 mutations in exons 5, 7 or 8 to wild-type in tumors from the high-pollution region was significantly higher than the ratio from the non-pollution site (0.28 versus 0.03, P \u003d 0.01). Logistic regression showed that G-to-T transversion mutation in K-ras was predicted by the region of residence of the patients.\nOur study reveals that there are differences in the frequencies and types of K-ras and p53 mutations found in pancreatic adenocarcinomas of patients in high-pollution and low-pollution regions in Egypt and suggests that environmental factors may explain these differences. We speculate that gene-environment interactions in pancreatic carcinogenesis also occur in other populations.","title":"Differences in K-ras and p53 gene mutations among pancreatic adenocarcinomas associated with regional environmental pollution.","pubmedId":"17575320"}
