We excluded 24 patients with only locoregional recurrence and analyzed data from 585 patients.\nDistant recurrence after complete resection was identified in 34 patients during a median follow-up period of 41.4 months. Multivariate Cox analysis identified solid tumor size on high-resolution computed tomography and the maximum standardized uptake value on F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography as independent predictors for distant recurrence-free survival. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed that solid tumor size ≥1.7 cm and the maximum standardized uptake value ≥3.3 were optimal criteria with which to detect patients at high risk for distant recurrence. In fact, 3-year distant recurrence rates were higher in patients who met the criteria for high risk (n \u003d 85) than those who did not (n \u003d 500) (28.1% vs. 3.7%; P \u003c 0.001). A similar trend was also found in patients with pathological node negative.\nSolid tumor size on high-resolution computed tomography and the maximum standardized uptake value on F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography were clinical predictors of distant recurrence among patients with clinical Stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. Our findings might be useful to determine personalized therapeutic strategies including systemic therapy.","title":"Preoperative predictors of distant recurrence in patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma undergoing complete resection.","pubmedId":"27784752"}
