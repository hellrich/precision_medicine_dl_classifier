However, the clinical significance of CTCs and circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has yet to be determined.\nIn this prospective study, CTCs and CTM were enumerated in the peripheral blood of 63 patients with PDAC before treatment using anti-EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule)-conjugated supported lipid bilayer-coated microfluidic chips. Associations of CTCs and CTM with patients\u0027 clinical factors and prognosis were determined.\nCTCs were abundant [mean (SD), 70.2 (107.6)] and present in 81% (51 of 63) of patients with PDAC. CTM were present in 81% (51 of 63) of patients with mean (SD) 29.7 (1101.4). CTM was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Patients were stratified into unfavorable and favorable CTM groups on the basis of CTM more or less than 30 per 2 mL blood, respectively. Patients with baseline unfavorable CTM, compared with patients with favorable CTM, had shorter PFS (2.7 vs 12.1 months; P \u003c 0.0001) and OS (6.4 vs 19.8 months; P \u003c 0.0001). Differences persisted if we stratified patients into early and advanced diseases. The number of CTM before treatment was an independent predictor of PFS and OS after adjustment for clinically significant factors.\nThe number of CTM, instead of CTCs, before treatment is an independent predictor of PFS and OS in patients with PDAC.","title":"Clinical Significance of Circulating Tumor Microemboli as a Prognostic Marker in Patients with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26861552"}
