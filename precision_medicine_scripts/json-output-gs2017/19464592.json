Multiple studies have consistently identified major host and environmental risk factors for melanoma. Nevi, particularly dysplastic nevi, confer much higher risks than most pigmentary characteristics. Ultraviolet radiation exposure is the predominant environmental risk factor for melanoma. Recently, both rare high risk susceptibility genes and common polymorphic genes contributing to melanoma risk have been identified.","title":"Melanoma epidemiology.","pubmedId":"19464592"}
