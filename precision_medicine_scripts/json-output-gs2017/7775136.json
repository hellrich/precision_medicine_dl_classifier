In the twenty-seven patients evaluable for response, two partial responses were seen. Toxicities observed were primarily hematologic with grade 3 or greater granulocytopenia occurring in 34% of the patients. One patient developed symptomatic congestive heart failure at a total cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2. We conclude that piroxantrone given at this dose and schedule has minimal activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer.","title":"Phase II trial of piroxantrone in metastatic breast cancer.
