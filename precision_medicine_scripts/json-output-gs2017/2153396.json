In agreement with other workers, we observed c-erbB2 gene amplification in 17.5% of the tumours studied. In addition, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of c-erbB2 mRNA expression in the tumours using RNase mapping and in situ hybridisation techniques. Our results indicated a more frequent (30%) overexpression of c-erbB2 mRNA, which was associated only with breast carcinomas of a ductal origin. Furthermore, analysis of the c-erbB2 mRNA gene locus in the same tumours demonstrated that enhanced c-erbB2 expression could occur in the presence or absence of gene amplification, suggesting that additional molecular mechanisms may result in overexpression of c-erbB2 mRNA in human mammary tumours. In situ hybridisation showed that elevated levels of c-erbB2 mRNA were specific to malignant cells within the breast tumour. Analysis of the association between c-erbB2 mRNA overexpression and clinicopathological factors revealed a significant correlation with poor tumour grade, but not with steroid receptor status or patient menopausal status. No significant correlation was observed between overexpression of c-erbB2 mRNA and early disease recurrence in our group of patients, although there was a definite trend towards poorer prognosis.","title":"C-erbB2 mRNA expression in human breast tumours: comparison with c-erbB2 DNA amplification and correlation with prognosis.","pubmedId":"2153396"}
