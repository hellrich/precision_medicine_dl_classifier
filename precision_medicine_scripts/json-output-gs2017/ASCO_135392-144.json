Among patients with KRAS mutations, their clinical course during treatment is heterogeneous.  The presence of concurrent genetic alterations in other oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such as TP53 or STK11 may affect outcomes for patients with KRAS mutant lung cancers.  We sought to use a next-generation sequencing-based assay to comprehensively describe concurrent genetic alterations present in KRAS mutant lung cancers and explore the effect of such alterations on patient outcomes.  Methods:  We studied tumor DNAs from 102 patients with stage IV/recurrent KRAS mutant lung cancers enriched for cases with longer and shorter overall survivals.  All patients received standard therapies for advanced lung cancer.  We performed massively parallel sequencing (Ion Torrent PGM) of all exons from 65 cancer genes using a custom AmpliSeq panel.  The sequence data were analyzed for point mutations and small insertions and deletions using a custom pipeline. We collected clinical characteristics, survival, and concurrent mutations.  The association of concurrent mutations and overall survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methodology with log rank test for comparisons.  Results:   Among these 102 samples in which the KRAS (G12C\u003d47, G12D\u003d23, G12V\u003d12, G12A\u003d9, Other\u003d11) mutation was confirmed by Ion Torrent PGM sequencing, we found 0 to 11 concurrent mutations with a majority of the patients having 1 (24), 2 (30), or 3 (16) mutations in addition to KRAS. The most frequent concurrent mutations included TP53 (21), KEAP1 (13), SMARCA4 (7), and ARID1A (6).  There was no difference in median overall survival between patients with or without a concurrent mutation in TP53 (21 vs 25 mos, p\u003d0.84), KEAP1 (19 vs 25 months, p\u003d0.86), SMARCA4 (12 vs 25 months, p\u003d0.14) or ARID1A(22 vs 25 months, p\u003d0.5).      Conclusions:  This study is the largest reported series of KRAS mutant lung cancers with a broad analysis of concurrent molecular alterations and survival. There was no significant effect on survival for concurrent mutations in the identified cancer associated genes.","title":"Concurrent molecular alterations in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas and effects on overall survival.","pubmedId":"ASCO_135392-144"}
