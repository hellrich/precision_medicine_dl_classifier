The protocol described has been successfully used to identify differential transcript expression between contrasting colorectal cancer invasive phenotypes. Tissue processing, RNA extraction, quality control, amplification, fluorescent labelling, purification, hybridisation, and elements of data analysis are covered.","title":"Oligonucleotide microarray expression profiling of contrasting invasive phenotypes in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"21761306"}
