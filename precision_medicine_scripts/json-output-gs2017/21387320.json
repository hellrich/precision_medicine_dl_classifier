PDGFRA expression was judged using a scoring system subdividing tumors in negative/weak and strong immunoreactivity groups. For mutation analysis, exons 9, 10, 11, 13, and 17 of KIT and exons 10, 12, 14, and 18 of PDGFRA were sequenced.\nOf 95 R0-resected GISTs, 69% showed strong PDGFRA immunoreactivity. Gastric GISTs revealed a significantly higher rate of strong PDGFRA immunoreactivity (P \u003d 0.01) and longer DFS (P \u003d 0.015) than GISTs of the small intestine. KIT mutations were detected in 43 of 63 (68.3%) completely sequenced cases while PDGFRA mutations were identified in 6 cases (10%). In multivariate analysis, neither KIT/PDGFRA expression nor mutational status of KIT or PDGFRA were independent prognostic factors. Only mitotic rate predicted recurrence independently.\nOur data do not support the notion that expression of PDGFRA or mutations in KIT or PDGFRA are independent prognostic factors after curative resection of primary GIST.","title":"Mutational status of KIT and PDGFRA and expression of PDGFRA are not associated with prognosis after curative resection of primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).","pubmedId":"21387320"}
