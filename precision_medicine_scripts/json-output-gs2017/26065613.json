The development of cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, radium-223, and sipuleucel-T has increased the number of treatment options. Because these agents were developed concurrently within a short period of time, prospective data on their sequential use efficacy are scarce. The challenge now is to reach a consensus on the best way to sequence effective treatments, ideally by the use of an approach specific to patient subgroups. However, the absence of robust surrogates of survival and the lack of predictive biomarkers makes data for the sequential use of these agents difficult to obtain and interpret.
