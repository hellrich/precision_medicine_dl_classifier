The goal of this study was to determine if patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have hepatic and peritoneal micrometastasis at operation. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are known to have a high incidence of K-ras gene mutations. Liver tissue specimens were obtained from 30 patients (17 with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 13 with other diseases) with a biopsy needle at operation. Peritoneal washings were obtained during operation from 20 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Two-stage polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were used to detect K-ras oncogene mutation at codon 12. Thirteen of 17 pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients had K-ras gene mutations in the liver, whereas all 13 patients with other diseases did not. However, only two of 20 pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients revealed K-ras gene mutation in peritoneal lavage fluids. These results indicate the feasibility of detecting hepatic micrometastasis in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and imply that PCR/RFLP analysis may be of value in the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of hepatic metastasis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"Detection of hepatic micrometastasis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients by two-stage polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.","pubmedId":"7559078"}
