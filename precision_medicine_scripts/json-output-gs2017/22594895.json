Although not the most common cutaneous malignancy, it is the most lethal. Until recently, while other oncologic patients benefited from the nuances of targeted therapy, those afflicted with melanoma lacked that option. In 2011, the US FDA approved an oral agent that targets the BRAF oncogene. As this information is promising, it is essential that other populations (in addition to Caucasians) are examined, in order to further comprehend the biology of melanoma. Recent studies profiling various ethnicities, including Asians, have provided novel data with respect to the molecular characterization (c-KIT, BRAF, NRAS) of melanoma. It is hopeful that the management of melanoma will be universally applicable to all ethnic groups.","title":"Molecular targets in melanoma: time for \u0027ethnic personalization\u0027.","pubmedId":"22594895"}
