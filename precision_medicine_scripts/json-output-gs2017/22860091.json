Identification of biomarkers associated with outcome of pancreatic cancer may provide new approaches and targets for anticancer therapy. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the expression of RhoT1, Smad4 and p16 and metastasis and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. The analysis showed that the high cytoplasmic expression levels of RhoT1, Smad4 and p16 in pancreatic cancer tissues had significantly negative correlation with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (P \u003d 0.017, P \u003d 0.032, P \u003d 0.042, respectively). However, no significant association was observed between perineural invasion (PNI) and the expression of above three proteins (all P\u003e0.05). Additionally, the survival analysis showed that the low expression levels of RhoT1 and Smad4 were significantly associated with worse survival (P \u003d 0.034, P \u003d 0.047, respectively). In conclusion, these results indicated that the low-expression levels of RhoT1 and Smad4 were significantly associated with LNM and shorter survival. RhoT1 may be considered as a potential novel marker for predicting the outcome in patients with pancreatic cancer.","title":"RhoT1 and Smad4 are correlated with lymph node metastasis and overall survival in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"22860091"}
