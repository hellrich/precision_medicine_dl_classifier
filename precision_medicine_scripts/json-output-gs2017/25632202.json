KRAS mutations occurred more frequently in females than in males (P\u003d0.02), while the presence of BRAF mutations was significantly associated with the female gender (P\u003d0.006), proximal tumor location (P\u003c0.001), mucinous or poorly differentiated histology (P\u003c0.001), and MSI-high tumors (P\u003c0.001). After adjusting for relevant variables, including MSI status, KRAS mutations were associated with poorer DFS (HR\u003d1.35; 95%CI: 1.03-1.75) and OS (HR\u003d1.46; 95%CI: 1.09-1.97). BRAF mutations were poor prognostic factors for DFS (HR\u003d2.20; 95%CI: 1.19-4.06) and OS (HR\u003d2.30; 95%CI: 1.15-4.71). Neither the BRAF by MSI interaction test nor the KRAS by MSI interaction test yielded statistically significant results for DFS and OS.\nKRAS and BRAF mutations are associated with inferior survival, independent of MSI status, in Japanese patients with curatively resected CRC.","title":"Prognostic value of KRAS and BRAF mutations in curatively resected colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"25632202"}
