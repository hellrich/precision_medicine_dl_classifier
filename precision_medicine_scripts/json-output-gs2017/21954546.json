A 63-year old male presented with a mass at right breast and modified radical mastectomy was performed. Pathology was reported as invasive ductal carcinoma. Radiotherapy and tamoxifen was administered following chemotherapy. At the 5th month, a mass was detected at left breast and modified radical mastectomy was performed. Chemotherapy was started postoperatively. BRCA1 and BRCA2 were reported negative. Although male breast cancer is rare, male patients with breast cancer may have cancer at the other breast (Fig. 1, Ref. 5).","title":"Bilateral breast cancer: a male patient.","pubmedId":"21954546"}
