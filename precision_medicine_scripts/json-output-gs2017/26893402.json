This study aimed to validate digital PCR (dPCR) methodology on cytological material. In plasmid model system, dPCR allowed for the detection of a minimal percentage (1%) of EGFR mutant alleles. Cytological samples (n \u003d 30), with neoplastic cell percentage ranging from 10% to 80% and yielding a quantity of extracted DNA ranging from 1.75 to 60 ng/µL were selected. Results previously generated by fragment length and TaqMan assays (n \u003d 8 exon 19 deletions, n \u003d 2 L858R mutations and n \u003d 20 wild-type DNA) were compared with those obtained by dPCR. Data were highly concordant (96.6%). However, dPCR detected an additional L858R mutation that had been missed by TaqMan assay on a paucicellular smear. This mutation was confirmed by cloning PCR products and sequencing. Thus, dPCR can reliably be used to increase EGFR mutation detection rate on scarcely cellular lung cancer smears.","title":"EGFR mutation detection on routine cytological smears of non-small cell lung cancer by digital PCR: a validation study.","pubmedId":"26893402"}
