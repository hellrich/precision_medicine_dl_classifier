The most common mutations (L858R and exon 19 deletions) predict an improved clinical response to first-line oral EGFR-TKIs compared with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Moreover, these mutations are also prognostic of a relatively indolent course of disease, regardless of treatment, as compared with classical NSCLC. Treatment strategies for oncogene-addicted NSCLC are therefore distinct from those for non-oncogene addicted NSCLC, and will depend on the specific genetic mutation present.","title":"EGFR-mutated oncogene-addicted non-small cell lung cancer: current trends and future prospects.","pubmedId":"22119437"}
