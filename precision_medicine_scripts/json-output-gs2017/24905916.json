However, a variety of breast cancer cell lines are resistant to TRAIL and the mechanisms of resistance are largely unknown. In our present experiment, we successfully utilized breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 to establish TRAIL-resistant cell line. We found resistance to TRAIL could induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance invasiveness. We further demonstrated PTEN was down-regulated in TRAIL-resistant cells. Silencing miR-221, PTEN expression was up-regulated, the process of EMT could be reversed, and the ability of migration and invasion were correspondingly weakened. We also demonstrated knockdown of miR-221 could reverse resistance to TRAIL partially by targeting PTEN. Our findings suggest that resistance to TRAIL could induce EMT and enhance invasiveness by suppressing PTEN via miR-221. Re-expression of miR-221 or targeting PTEN might serve as potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of Trail-resistant breast cancer.
