One of the target genes, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), has been reported to be amplified in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtype breast cancer, and is considered one possible mechanism of endocrine resistance through cross-talk between ER and growth factor receptor signaling. We performed a comprehensive analysis of FGFR1 at the levels of gene copy number, transcript and protein expression, and examined the relationships between FGFR1 status and clinicopathological parameters, including prognosis in 307 ER-positive/HER2-negative primary breast cancer patients treated with standard care at our institute. Most notably, a high level of FGFR1 protein expression was observed in 85 patients (27.7%), and was positively associated with invasive tumor size (P \u003d 0.039). Furthermore, univariate analysis revealed that high FGFR1 protein expression was significantly correlated with poor relapse-free survival rate (P \u003d 0.0019, HR: 2.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-5.98), and showed a tendency towards an increase in recurrent events if the observation period extended beyond the 5 years of the standard endocrine treatment term. FGFR1 gain/amplification was found in 43 (14.0%) patients, which was only associated with higher nuclear grade (P \u003d 0.010). No correlation was found between FGFR1 mRNA expression levels and any clinicopathological factors. Overall, the level of FGFR1 protein expression may be a biomarker of ER-positive/HER2-negative primary breast cancer with possible resistance to standard treatment, and may be a useful tool to identify more specific patients who would benefit from FGFR-1 targeted therapy.
