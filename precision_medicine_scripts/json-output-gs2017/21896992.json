In colorectal cancer (CRC) EGFR family has been found frequently over-expressed, thus therapy targeting EGFR has been developed. Interestingly, it has been observed that genetic variants in these receptors may alter the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR inhibitors. Polymorphic variants in members of the EGFR family could influence different biologic activities, such as ligands affinity, dimerization efficiency, kinase activity, expression levels, with a consequent impact in signalling pathways and cell behaviour. This study aimed to verify whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of EGFR family members could represent susceptibility factors able to influence the risk to develop CRC. Peripheral blood of 70 Italian colon cancer patients and 72 healthy controls was used as a source of genomic DNA to investigate EGFR, HER2 and HER3 common non-synonymous SNPs. Genetic association tests were performed to verify a possible relationship with CRC. Evidence of genotype association was found for the R521K EGFR polymorphism under a dominant mode of inheritance (Mid-P\u003d0.031). Genotypes with the variant allele of EGFR R521K SNP confer a risk reduction to develop CRC.","title":"The EGFR R521K polymorphism influences the risk to develop colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"21896992"}
