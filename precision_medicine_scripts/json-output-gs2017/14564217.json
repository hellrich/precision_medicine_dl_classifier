This autosomal dominant condition can be caused by mutations in either fibroblast growth factor receptor gene type 1 or 2 (FGFR1 or FGFR2). We report four new affected families showing an FGFR1 P252R mutation and emphasize the characteristic malformations of the feet in this form of Pfeiffer syndrome. In one family this was the only abnormality.","title":"The appearance of the feet in Pfeiffer syndrome caused by FGFR1 P252R mutation.","pubmedId":"14564217"}
