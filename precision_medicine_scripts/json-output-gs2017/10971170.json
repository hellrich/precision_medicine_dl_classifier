Immunoreactivity for proGRP was detected exclusively in MTC (n \u003d 7); other histological types (n \u003d 12) were all negative for proGRP. In addition, serum proGRP levels were elevated in patients with primary or recurrent MTC (n \u003d 3), and they changed in parallel with serum calcitonin (CT), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). These results show that proGRP, which is considered to be a specific marker for small-cell lung carcinoma, may be also a potential tumor marker for MTC, in addition to CT and CEA.","title":"Demonstration and diagnostic significance of pro-gastrin-releasing peptide in medullary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"10971170"}
