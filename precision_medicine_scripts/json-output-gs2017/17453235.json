In this study, we report on a pancreatic tumor whose phenotype and genotype could not be assigned to any known tumor entity. The tumor was observed in the pancreatic head of a 54-year-old woman. It was found to be a solid infiltrating carcinoma with abundant clear cells. Apart from cytokeratin, the tumor cells expressed vimentin, S100, and MUC-1. DNA microarray analysis revealed a transcription profile clearly differing from that of normal pancreatic tissue and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Despite metastatic behavior, the tumor displayed a more favorable course than conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We suggest that this tumor be called solid type clear cell carcinoma of the pancreas.","title":"Solid type clear cell carcinoma of the pancreas: differential diagnosis of an unusual case and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"17453235"}
