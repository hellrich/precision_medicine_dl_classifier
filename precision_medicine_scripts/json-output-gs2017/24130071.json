The main objectives of this study were to investigate the clinical implications of miR-34b/c methylation in patients with early-stage lung adenocarcinoma and to determine the functional role of miR-34b/c re-expression in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.\nAberrant methylation and expression of miR-34b/c were assessed in 15 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and a cohort of 140 early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were transfected with miR-34b/c and the effects upon cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were investigated.\nAberrant methylation of miR-34b/c was detected in 6 (40%) of 15 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and 64 of 140 (46%) primary lung adenocarcinoma. Expression of miR-34b/c was significantly reduced in all methylated cell lines and primary tumors, especially with TP53 mutations. Patients with increased miR-34b/c methylation had significantly shorter disease-free and overall survival as compared to patients with unmethylated or low level of miR-34b/c methylation. Ectopic expression of miR-34b/c in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.\nEpigenetic inactivation of miR-34b/c by DNA methylation has independent prognostic value in patients with early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. Reexpression of miR-34b/c leads to a less aggressive phenotype in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.","title":"Epigenetic inactivation of microRNA-34b/c predicts poor disease-free survival in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24130071"}
