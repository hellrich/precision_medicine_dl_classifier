Similar associations were observed when comparing mutation carriers with a combined group of CDKN2A(-) (wild type) and sporadic melanomas. The presence of spindle cell morphology in the vertical growth phase was also an important predictor of genotype. Of the 15 cases with this phenotype, none were observed to harbor a CDKN2A mutation.\nOur study examined rare mutations and may have been underpowered to detect small, but biologically significant associations between histology and genotype.\nFamilial melanomas with CDKN2A mutations preferentially express a histologic phenotype of dense pigmentation, high pagetoid scatter, and a non-spindle cell morphology in the vertical growth phase.","title":"Histologic features of melanoma associated with CDKN2A genotype.","pubmedId":"25592620"}
