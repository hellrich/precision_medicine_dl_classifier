Among lung cancers, 40% are diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. Bromodomain containing 7 (BRD7) is a member of bromodomain-containing protein family. It was proved to be downregulated in various cancers. However, the role of BRD7 in lung adenocarcinoma is still unknown. Western blot and qRT-PCR was performed to measure the BRD7 expression in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and cells. CCK8 and migration assay was done to detect the functional role of BRD7 in lung adenocarcinoma. In this study, we showed that the expression of BRD7 was downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and cells. The lower of BRD7 levels in patients with lung adenocarcinoma was associated with shortened disease-free survival. Furthermore, overexpression of BRD7 inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and migration. Inhibition of BRD7 expression promoted cell proliferation and migration by activating ERK phosphorylation. Overexpression of BRD7 inhibited cyclin D and myc expression. Our findings are consistent with a tumor suppressor role for BRD7 in lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis. ","title":"BRD7 Acts as a Tumor Suppressor Gene in Lung Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27580131"}
