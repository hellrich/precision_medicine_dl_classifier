This protein can be localized immunohistochemically in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material using a monoclonal antibody NCL-CB11; positive membrane staining correlates with gene amplification and protein overexpression in breast cancer. Using this technique we have shown that only 2/26 (8%) of hepatocellular carcinomas, 0/10 (0%) of cholangiocarcinomas and 0/2 (0%) hepatoblastomas overexpressed c-erbB-2 as evidenced by membrane staining. Moreover c-erbB-2 mRNA was not detected in seven hepatocellular carcinomas examined by Northern blot analysis. c-erbB-2 overexpression is, therefore, unlikely to be contributing to the malignant phenotype in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"c-erbB-2 oncogene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"1380026"}
