GPD1L protein levels were evaluated in HNSCC from 135 patients using immunohistochemical staining. Correlations were analysed between GPD1L levels and local recurrence rate, regional recurrence rate, second primary malignancy rate), disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). The results of real-time PCR showed that, compared with the paired normal tissues, mRNA levels of GPD1L were decreased significantly in HNSCC (P \u003c 0.001). Patients whose tumours showed high GPD1L protein expression had a significantly better prognosis than those whose tumours showed low expression (61.3% versus 21.4%, P \u003c 0.001 for DFS; 68% versus 39.3%, P \u003d 0.001 for DSS). High GPD1L expression was associated with a lower local recurrence rate than low GPD1L expression (P \u003d 0.049). Multivariate survival analysis also showed that GPD1L expression was an independent prognostic factor (P \u003d 0.001).\nOur results indicate that the GPD1L expression is a strong predictor for local recurrence and survival in HNSCC.","title":"The prognostic value of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24274692"}
