Most lung cancers are non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), which are further subclassified into squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Lung neuroendocrine tumors are subclassified into typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, small cell carcinoma, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. In NSCLC in particular, the histologic classification and tumor mutation analysis are central to today\u0027s targeted therapy and personalized treatment. This article discusses the current diagnostic criteria for classification of NSCLC and lung neuroendocrine tumors and implications for oncologic treatment.","title":"The changing pathology of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21986262"}
