Several related clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KIF5B-RET rearrangements using existing RET inhibitors, such as cabozantinib, lenvatinib, vandetanib, sunitinib, ponatinib, and AUY922, have been swiftly initiated by the discovery of the KIF5B-RET fusion gene. Anti-RET activity and the status of clinical development of cabozantinib for KIF5B-RET fusion-positive NSCLC are discussed.","title":"Cabozantinib for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with KIF5B-RET fusion.
