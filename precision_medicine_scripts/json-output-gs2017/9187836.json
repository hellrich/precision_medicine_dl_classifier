With EADV criteria, these figures fell to 7 (6.4%), 7 (9.7%) and 6 (24%), respectively. Only 3 L-DLE (2.7%), 5 D-DLE (6.9%) and 3 SCLE cases (12%) defined as SLE by ARA criteria and 1, 3 and 3, respectively, by EADV criteria had a renal or neurological disorder, hemolytic anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, vasculitis or serositis. ARA criteria did not classify 7 patients with a similar visceral involvement, while EADV criteria failed in 11 patients.\nIn our patients, ARA criteria showed a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 79%, a positive predictive value of 56% and a negative predictive value of 96%. EADV criteria showed a sensitivity of only 64%, but a specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 61% and a negative predictive value of 94%. ARA criteria should not be used in CLE patients as they are too sensitive, poorly specific and altogether misleading. EADV criteria are more specific, but less sensitive.","title":"ARA and EADV criteria for classification of systemic lupus erythematosus in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus.","pubmedId":"9187836"}
