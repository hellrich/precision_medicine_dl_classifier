One downstream target of let-7 is the RAS gene family, including KRAS, an important oncogene in the etiology and clinical outcome of lung adenocarcinoma. Recently, a SNP in the let-7 binding region of the KRAS 3\u0027 UTR was identified (termed LCS6). This functional polymorphism alters let-7 binding, resulting in both increased KRAS expression and decreased let-7 exposure. Further, this SNP has been reported as a risk trait for lung cancer among low-moderate smokers. Given the functionality of LCS6, we tested the hypothesis that this SNP is associated with the occurrence of KRAS mutation as well as patient survival. Here, we report there is no association between the LCS6 KRAS polymorphism and KRAS mutation. Further, we find no association between the LCS6 polymorphism and lung cancer survival. These unexpected findings imply that this newly reported KRAS-LCS6 polymorphism will have limited clinical utility for NSCLC.","title":"KRAS mutation, KRAS-LCS6 polymorphism, and non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"19854534"}
