The methods of microcatheterization of the pulmonary artery and radiography have been used (even under ergometrical exercise) as well as the calibrated apex cardiography and the echocardiography. For the practising physician a classification of hypertensive heart disease with 4 phases or forms is proposed. The paper ends with a demonstration of the close relationship between prevention and treatment of hypertension as well as between hypertensive and ischaemic heart disease at the same time in a sense of the integrative role of heart insufficiency.","title":"[The heart in hypertension].","pubmedId":"6451989"}
