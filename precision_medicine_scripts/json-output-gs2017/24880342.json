We identified large-effect genome-wide associations for squamous lung cancer with the rare variants BRCA2 p.Lys3326X (rs11571833, odds ratio (OR) \u003d 2.47, P \u003d 4.74 × 10(-20)) and CHEK2 p.Ile157Thr (rs17879961, OR \u003d 0.38, P \u003d 1.27 × 10(-13)). We also showed an association between common variation at 3q28 (TP63, rs13314271, OR \u003d 1.13, P \u003d 7.22 × 10(-10)) and lung adenocarcinoma that had been previously reported only in Asians. These findings provide further evidence for inherited genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and its biological basis. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that imputation can identify rare disease-causing variants with substantive effects on cancer risk from preexisting genome-wide association study data.
