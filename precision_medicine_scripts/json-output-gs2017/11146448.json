The PTEN (also called MMAC1 and TEP1) gene, a candidate tumor suppressor located at chromosome 10q23.3, is mutated in a variety of sporadic malignancies as well as in patients with Cowden disease. To investigate the potential role of the PTEN gene in renal tumorigenesis, we searched for abnormalities of the gene in 68 primary renal-cell carcinomas (RCCs) as well as in 17 renal carcinoma-derived cell lines, using DNA-SSCP, sequencing and microsatellite analysis. Five of 68 (7.5%) primary RCCs exhibited intragenic mutations (3 missense, 1 deletion and 1 splice-site), and 1 of 17 (5.9%) cell lines had an insertion mutation. Loss of heterozygosity of the PTEN gene occurred in 25% of primary RCCs, including the 3 cases with intragenic mutation and the 1 PTEN-mutated cell line. Clinical and histopathological examinations revealed that 4 of the 5 primary tumors with PTEN mutation were high-grade, advanced clear-cell RCCs with distant metastases or renal vein tumor invasions, resulting in poor prognostic courses. The other was a low-stage papillary/chromophilic RCC. Our data suggest that PTEN mutation is observed in a subset of RCCs and that, especially in clear-cell RCCs, it occurs as a late-stage event and may contribute to the invasive and/or metastatic tumor phenotype.","title":"PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 mutations in human primary renal-cell carcinomas and renal carcinoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"11146448"}
