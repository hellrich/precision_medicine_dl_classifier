Recent available data on the determination of serum concentrations of collagen-derived serum peptides and quantitative analysis of echoreflectivity to address the presence of fibrosis in the myocardium of hypertensive patients are promising. In addition, preliminary data suggest that the goal of reducing myocardial fibrosis is achievable in patients with hypertensive heart disease using specific antihypertensive agents (e.g. those interfering with angiotensin II).\nThe time has come to revisit the current management of hypertensive heart disease simply focused on detecting left-ventricular hypertrophy and controlling blood pressure to reduce left-ventricular mass. It is necessary to develop new approaches aimed at assessing and repairing alterations of myocardial structure and protect myocardial function and, in so doing, to reduce in a more-effective manner adverse risk associated with hypertensive heart disease.","title":"New directions in the assessment and treatment of hypertensive heart disease.","pubmedId":"16046900"}
