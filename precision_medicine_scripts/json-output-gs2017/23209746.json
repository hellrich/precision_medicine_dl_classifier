To evaluate the role of RAD52 variants in the response of tumor cells to platinum agents, we investigated their associations with platinum resistance and prognosis in cervical cancer patients. We enrolled 154 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma, who had radical surgery between 2008 and 2009, and genotyped three potentially functional RAD52 variants by the SNaPshot assay. We tested in vitro platinum resistance and RAD52 expression by using the MTT and immunohistochemistry methods, respectively. In 144 cases who had genotyping data, we found that both the rs1051669 variant and RAD52 protein expression were significantly associated with carboplatin resistance (P \u003d 0.024 and 0.028, respectively) and rs10774474 with nedaplatin resistance (P \u003d 0.018). The rs1051669 variant was significantly associated with RAD52 protein expression (adjusted OR \u003d 4.7, 95% CI \u003d 1.4-16.1, P \u003d 0.013). When these three RAD52 variants were combined, progression-free survival was lower in patients who carried at least one (≥1) variant allele compared to those without any of the variant alleles (P \u003d 0.047). Therefore, both RAD52 variants and protein expression can predict platinum resistance, and RAD52 variants appeared to predict prognosis in cervical cancer patients. Large studies are warranted to validate these findings.","title":"RAD52 variants predict platinum resistance and prognosis of cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"23209746"}
