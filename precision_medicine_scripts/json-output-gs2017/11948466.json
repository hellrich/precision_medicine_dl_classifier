BRCA2 mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR. Histologic grade III tumors showed significantly (p \u003d 0.001) higher BRCA2 mRNA levels (0.828 +/- 0.102 BRCA2/beta-glucuronidase mRNA ratio, mean +/- SE) than histologic grade I and II tumors (0.438 +/- 0.055) and estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors (0.773 +/- 0.102) showed a nonsignificant (p \u003d 0.072) trend toward an increase in BRCA2 mRNA levels compared to ER-positive tumors (0.541 +/- 0.079). Other clinicopathologic parameters, such as menopausal status, lymph node status and tumor size, were not significantly associated with BRCA2 mRNA levels. Patients with high BRCA2 mRNA levels showed a significantly (p \u003d 0.006) lower 5-year disease free survival rate (63%) than those with low levels (94%). Lymph node metastases, ER negativity and high histologic grade were also significantly (p \u003c 0.05) associated with poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that BRCA2 mRNA levels were a significant prognostic factor, being independent of the other conventional prognostic factors. Our results suggest that BRCA2 mRNA levels might serve as a clinically useful prognostic factor in breast cancer patients.","title":"High BRCA2 mRNA expression predicts poor prognosis in breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"11948466"}
