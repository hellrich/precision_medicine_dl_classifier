{"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Primary breast-like vulva cancer, as well as metastatic disease of breast cancer to the vulva are described to be very rare, especially many years after the treatment of the primary breast tumor. Breast cancer rarely metastasizes to the vulva without finding other metastatic sites. We report a case of a 93-year-old woman with an isolated metastatic vulvar nodule thirteen years after the surgical treatment of primary breast cancer. The prior histology was a node negative invasive lobular breast cancer. The histology of the vulvar nodule was similar to the primary breast cancer. No other metastatic sites were found by both clinical examination and imaging. When isolated metastasis to the vulva is found, a primary cancer in the gynaecological area should be excluded first.\nBreast cancer - Vulvar metastasis - Rare breast metastasis.","title":"Metastatic lobular carcinoma of the breast to the vulva: a case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"21503007"}
