Here, we report on a method that allows for the rapid detection of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations based on pyrosequencing. The method is applicable to routinely processed tissue specimens and provides quantitative mutation data within less than one working day. Due to its high sensitivity, the technique may also be used for the diagnostic assessment of IDH1 or IDH2 mutation in tissue samples with low tumor cell content, such as the infiltration zone of diffuse gliomas. Using pyrosequencing and/or conventional cycle sequencing of IDH1 and IDH2 in 262 gliomas, we confirm frequent mutations in diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas, corroborate a prognostic role for IDH1 mutation in primary glioblastomas and show that pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas generally lack mutations in these genes.","title":"Rapid and sensitive assessment of the IDH1 and IDH2 mutation status in cerebral gliomas based on DNA pyrosequencing.","pubmedId":"20131059"}
