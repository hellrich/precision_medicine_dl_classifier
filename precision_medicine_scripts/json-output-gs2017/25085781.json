However, the mechanisms of EGFR exon 19 deletion in lung adenocarcinoma were unclear. Lung adenocarcinoma was divided into EGFR exon 19 deletion group and EGFR wild-type group. We studied the differential expression profiles of lncRNAs in EGFR exon 19 deletion in lung adenocarcinoma by high-throughput microarray. Using abundant and varied probes, we were able to assess 30,586 lncRNAs and 26,109 mRNAs in our microarray. Compared with the wild-type EGFR, we found that 1,533 lncRNAs and 1,406 mRNAs were differentially expressed (â‰¥ twofold change) in EGFR exon 19 deletion in lung adenocarcinoma, indicating that many lncRNAs were significantly upregulated or downregulated in EGFR exon 19 deletion in lung adenocarcinoma. The 10 lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in EGFR exon 19 deletion in lung adenocarcinoma compared with wild-type EGFR group validated by real-time RT-PCR. Among these, RP11-325I22.2 and LOC440905 were the most aberrantly expressed in 20 cases of EGFR exon 19 deletion in lung adenocarcinoma samples by real-time RT-PCR. Our study showed lncRNAs expression pattern in EGFR exon 19 deletion in lung adenocarcinoma by microarray. RP11-325I22.2 and LOC440905 might play an important role in the mechanism of EGFR exon 19 deletion in lung adenocarcinoma. The study may provide a new mechanism of EGFR exon 19 deletion in lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"LncRNA expression profiles of EGFR exon 19 deletions in lung adenocarcinoma ascertained by using microarray analysis.","pubmedId":"25085781"}
