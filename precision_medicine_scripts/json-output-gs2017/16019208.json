The primary aim of treatment is to provide biliary drainage with long-term relief from pruritus, cholangitis, pain and jaundice. Endoscopically placed self-expanding metallic biliary stent has low procedure-related complications and is probably the modality of choice for patients with unresectable tumour on preoperative assessment. Percutaneous biliary drainage has comparable results and is an alternative when endoscopic expertise is not available or has failed or there are multiple isolated segments with cholangitis. Surgical cholangiojejunostomy provides lasting biliary drainage but has limitations of associated morbidity and mortality. In the absence of high-quality studies, comparing these modalities the choice of biliary drainage procedure should be guided by the available local expertise. Other modalities of treatment like radiotherapy, chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy currently remain investigational.","title":"Palliative management of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"16019208"}
