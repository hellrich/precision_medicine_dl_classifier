Recently, colorectal cancer subtyping consortium (CRCSC) identified 4 consensus molecular subtypes (CMS). CMS1 is enriched for CRC with deficient DNA mismatch repair system (dMMR) and tumors with mutated BRAF. Intriguingly, CMS1 is characterized by better relapse-free survival but worse survival after relapse, compared with the other subtypes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of prognostic and predictive impacts of MMR and BRAF status. We highlight immune checkpoints inhibitors as potentially future therapeutics for CRC with deficient MMR. We also focus on the management of BRAF mutant metastatic CRC, with a particular interest on targeted therapies.
