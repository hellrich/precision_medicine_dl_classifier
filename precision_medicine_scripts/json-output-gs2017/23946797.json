The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and significance of PTEN in breast carcinomas, to detect the mutation frequency of PTEN in sporadic breast carcinoma tissues and to determine the association between PTEN promoter methylation and gene expression. Immunohistochemical methods were used to analyze the expression of the PTEN gene in 146 cases of breast carcinoma and 10 cases of normal breast tissue closely adjacent to the carcinoma. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis was used to analyze conformation polymorphisms in 45 breast carcinoma and 10 normal breast tissues. Point mutations of abnormal single stranded conformation were detected by DNA sequencing. The methylation of the PTEN promoter was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR. Expression of PTEN was detected in 57.5% (84/146) of patients with breast carcinoma. By contrast, PTEN expression was detected in 100% of normal samples. Expression of PTEN was found to negatively correlate with the tumor size, the pathological stage and the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) in breast cancer. The 2-year disease-free survival of patients with a high expression of PTEN was higher compared with those with low PTEN expression (P\u003c0.05). Missense mutations in exon 2 of PTEN were identified in 1/45 breast cancer cases. PTEN promoter methylation was detected in 31.1% (14/45) of breast carcinomas, of which 64.3% (9/14) were associated with a loss of PTEN expression. The tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, was abnormally expressed in the breast carcinomas. The number of PTEN mutations were low (1/45) in the sporadic breast cancer cases analyzed in the present study and PTEN promoter methylation may have been the main mechanism leading to the decreased expression of PTEN. These results indicate that PTEN is important for the tumorigenesis, development and prognosis of breast cancer.","title":"PTEN mutation, methylation and expression in breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"23946797"}
