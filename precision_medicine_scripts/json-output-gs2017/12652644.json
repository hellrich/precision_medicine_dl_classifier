Their alterations have been associated to several human diseases, including some forms of cancer and developmental abnormalities. These features have contributed to the concept that one gene can be responsible for more than one disease. Moreover, both genes encoding for the two RTKs show genetic alterations that belong to either \"gain of function\" or \"loss of function\" class of mutations. In fact, receptor rearrangements or point mutations convert RET and NTRK1 in dominantly acting transforming genes leading to thyroid tumors, whereas inactivating mutations, associated with Hirschsprung\u0027s disease (HSCR) and congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), impair RET and NTRK1 functions, respectively. In this review we have summarized the main features of the two receptors, their physiological and pathological roles. In addition, we attempted to identify the correlations between the different genetic alterations and the related pathogenetic mechanisms.","title":"RET and NTRK1 proto-oncogenes in human diseases.","pubmedId":"12652644"}
