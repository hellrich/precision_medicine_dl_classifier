In this study, we evaluate the value of a novel assay utilizing plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) in assessing the long-term prognosis of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. Methods: To validate the accuracy and detection sensitivity of our novel NGS based cfDNA analysis, the allele frequency of KRAS mutations were compared to the result of ddPCR on cfDNA. Targeted cfDNA sequencing using a panel of 50 high-occurrence pancreatic cancer genes was performed on 84 plasma samples collected preoperatively from patients with resectable pancreatic cancer (stage I- II). The resulting somatic mutation profiles were then correlated with their corresponding clinical outcomes. Results: The validation experiments demonstrated that the allele frequency of KRAS between NGS highly correlate with ddPCR on cfDNA when the allele frequency was greater than 0.1%. 3 major KRAS variants and other known pancreatic driver genes including TP53, SMAD4, and CDKN2A were detected. Though somatic mutations were detected in only 1/3 of our sample set, all detected mutations were validated by tumor gDNA sequencing. Patients with matching mutation in cfDNA and tumor gDNA exhibited worse overall survival (os), especially those with the KRAS G12V mutation. Among patients with detectable levels of cfDNA, those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated an improved progression free survival (PFS) compared to those not receiving chemotherapy. Conclusions: We have generated cfDNA-derived somatic mutation profiles for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer using our novel technology Nebula  Firefly, a high precision sequencing technology equipped with a unique error correction mechanism. Comparative analysis of the relationship between somatic mutation profiles from patient cfDNA and tumor gDNA with patient outcomes suggests the detection of somatic mutations in cfDNA may have prognostic value. In addition, our preliminary results reveal ctDNA somatic mutation profiles may help identify strong candidates for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for improved clinical outcomes.","title":"Predicting long-term prognosis using targeted cell free DNA sequencing in resectable pancreatic cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_170697-176"}
