MMC and DDP inhibited the growth of SiHa and C-33A cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the combination of MMC or DDP with Ad5-p53 showed a stronger growth inhibition than those treated with either Ad5-p53, MMC, or DDP alone. As evidenced by the formation of the approximately 200 bp DNA ladder and the appearance of sub-G1 peak, both MMC and DDP induced apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. Western blot analysis of p53 showed that MMC/DDP did not induce the increase of p53 protein in SiHa cells nor the increase of the cellular and nuclear p53 protein in Ad5-p53 transfected Saos-2 cells. Taken together, these results suggested that the combination of Ad5-p53 and MMC/DDP may serve as an effective therapeutic regime for human cervical cancer treatment.","title":"Mitomycin C and cisplatin enhanced the antitumor activity of p53-expressing adenovirus in cervical cancer cells.","pubmedId":"11405176"}
