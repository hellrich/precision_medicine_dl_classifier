In 26, cervical cancer was the initial AIDS-defining illness, representing 4% (26 of 725) of the subjects, and it was the sixth most common initial AIDS-defining illness in women. Cervical cancer was the most common AIDS-related malignancy among women, representing 55% of the cases, followed by lymphoma (29%) and Kaposi sarcoma (16%). In 71% of the women with cervical cancer, HIV infection was diagnosed at the time of cancer presentation by routine testing, whereas in women with other malignancies, HIV diagnosis preceded cancer diagnosis (70%) by a mean of 2.7 years. Patients with other malignancies had greater immunosuppression (mean CD4 count 153/microL) than those with cervical cancer (mean CD4 count 312/microL). The recurrence rate for women with cervical cancer was 88%. Although the interval from cancer diagnosis to death was similar in all three groups (9.1-12.4 months), cancer was the cause of death in 95% of HIV-infected women with cervical cancer, compared with 60% of those with other AIDS-related malignancies.\nIn urban populations at increased risk for both diseases, cervical cancer is an important AIDS-defining illness and may be the most common AIDS-related malignancy in women.","title":"Cervical cancer as an AIDS-defining illness.","pubmedId":"8990442"}
