TRPS1, MYC and EIF3S3 genes are located in one of the minimal regions of amplification, 8q23-q24, and have been suggested to be the target genes of the amplification. Here, our goal was to study copy number and expression of the three genes in order to investigate the significance of the genes in breast and prostate cancer. By using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), we first found that TRPS1 and EIF3S3 were amplified together in about one-third of hormone-refractory prostate carcinomas. Next, we analysed the mRNA expression of the three genes by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and the gene copy number by FISH in six breast and five prostate cancer cell lines. Breast cancer cell line, SK-Br-3, which contained the highest copy number of all three genes, showed overexpression of only EIF3S3. Finally, the expression levels of TRPS1, EIF3S3 and MYC were measured in freshly frozen clinical samples of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), as well as untreated and hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma. The TRPS1 and MYC expression levels were similar in all prostate tumour groups, whereas EIF3S3 expression was higher (P\u003d0.029) in prostate carcinomas compared to BPH. The data suggest that the expression of EIF3S3 is increased in prostate cancer, and that one of the mechanisms underlying the overexpression is the amplification of the gene.","title":"Expression and copy number analysis of TRPS1, EIF3S3 and MYC genes in breast and prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"14997205"}
