KRAS data were collected from local laboratories (using their established methods) and/or from a central laboratory (mutation-specific Scorpion amplification-refractory mutation system). No adjustment was made for multiplicity; analyses were not powered to detect statistically significant differences.\nOf 820 patients, 616 (75%) had unambiguous KRAS data; 316 (51%) had KRAS wild-type tumors and 300 (49%) had mutant KRAS tumors. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.4 months for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 4.5 months for chemotherapy [P \u003c 0.0001; HR \u003d 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.77] for wild-type KRAS and 5.5 and 4.1 months, respectively (P \u003d 0.0027; HR \u003d 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56-0.89) for mutant KRAS. The median overall survival (OS) was 15.4 and 11.1 months, respectively (P \u003d 0.0052; HR \u003d 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53-0.90) for wild-type KRAS and 10.4 versus 10.0 months, respectively (P \u003d 0.4969; HR \u003d 0.92; 95% CI: 0.71-1.18) for mutant KRAS. In both analyses, no treatment interaction by KRAS status was observed (PFS, P \u003d 0.4436; OS, P \u003d 0.1266).\nBevacizumab beyond first progression represents an option for patients with mCRC treated with bevacizumab plus standard first-line chemotherapy, independent of KRAS status.","title":"Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy continued beyond first progression in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy: ML18147 study KRAS subgroup findings.","pubmedId":"23852309"}
