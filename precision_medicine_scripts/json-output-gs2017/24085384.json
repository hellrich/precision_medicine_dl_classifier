Complete tumor resection remains the most effective treatment of intra-hepatic or perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (PHCs). The objectives of this are to update and discuss methods that are likely to increase the resectability of cholangiocarcinomas, and to define the limits beyond which the risks of the treatments outweigh their benefits. We analyzed intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas and PHCs separately to determine the site of origin and the resectability of the tumor. We discussed the site at which to perform hepatic optimization prior to surgery, and whether liver transplantation might affect cholangiocarcinoma treatment.
