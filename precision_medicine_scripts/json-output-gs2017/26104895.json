According to the histopathological characteristics, lung cancer is divided into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer. Only 20% patients diagnosed with NSCLC have the chance for surgery while their 5-yr overall survival is about 30%-60%. The therapeutic outcome of surgery alone is not satisfying. Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection in stage II-IIIa lung cancer showed efficacy in many randomized clinical trials, but its role in stage I disease remains controversial. The choice of appropriate chemotherapy candidates, the selection of chemotherapy regimens and the research progress on biomarker are mainly discussed in this review. \n肺癌发病率及死亡率居全球癌症首位，按组织病理学可分为非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）和小细胞肺癌。仅有不到20%的NSCLC患者在初次诊断时有手术机会，而术后5年生存率大约只有30%-60%，单纯手术治疗的效果难以令人满意。很多临床随机试验结果显示术后辅助化疗可使II期-IIIa期NSCLC患者生存获益，而I期NSCLC患者是否需要术后辅助化疗存在争议。本文就I期NSCLC术后化疗人群选择的影响因素、化疗方案的选择以及生物学标志物等方面的研究进展做一综述。.","title":"[Progress of Postoperative Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Stage I Non-small Cell Lung Cancer].","pubmedId":"26104895"}
