Because of the frequent PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations in patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma, we evaluated the relationship between mutation status and both clinical/pathologic variables and tumor control in this subgroup.\nSeventeen of 64 patients harbored mutations in the assayed loci: 16% in PIK3CA, 9% in TP53, 2% in AKT1, and 2% in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The frequency of PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations in oropharyngeal and sinonasal primaries was increased compared to other primary sites (35% vs 6%; p \u003d .005). There was no relationship between mutation status and overall survival (OS), disease-specific death, or progression in the oropharyngeal cohort.\nWe identified frequent PIK3CA mutations in patients with high-risk HNSCC confined predominantly to the oropharyngeal and sinonasal subsites; for the first time, mutation in AKT1 has been identified in HNSCC.","title":"Mutation frequency in 15 common cancer genes in high-risk head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"23852799"}
