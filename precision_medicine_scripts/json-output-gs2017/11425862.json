Nerve growth factor is the cognate ligand for TrkA, brain-derived neurotrophic factor for TrkB, and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) for TrkC. NT-3 also binds TrkA and TrkB as a heterologous ligand. All neurotrophins bind p75, which regulates ligand affinity and Trk signals. Trk extracellular domain has five subdomains: a leucine-rich motif, two cysteine-rich clusters, and immunoglobulin-like subdomains IgG-C1 and IgG-C2. The IgG-C1 subdomain is surface exposed in the tertiary structure and regulates ligand-independent activation. The IgG-C2 subdomain is less exposed but regulates cognate ligand binding and Trk activation. NT-3 as a heterologous ligand of TrkA and TrkB optimally requires the IgG-C2 but also binds other subdomains of these receptors. When p75 is co-expressed, major changes are observed; NGF-TrkA activation can occur also via the cysteine 1 subdomain, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-TrkB activation requires the TrkB leucine-rich motif and cysteine 2 subdomains. We propose a two-site model of Trk binding and activation, regulated conformationally by the IgG-C1 subdomain. Moreover, p75 affects Trk subdomain utilization in ligand-dependent activation, possibly by conformational or allosteric control.","title":"p75 Co-receptors regulate ligand-dependent and ligand-independent Trk receptor activation, in part by altering Trk docking subdomains.","pubmedId":"11425862"}
