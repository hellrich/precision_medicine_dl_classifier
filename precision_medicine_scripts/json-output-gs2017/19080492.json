Stem-loop real-time RT-PCR was used to examine the mir-21 expression. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the PTEN protein expression in the tumor tissue. The association of mir-21 expression with the PTEN expression and the clinicopathologic features of the breast IDC were analyzed.\nCompared with the nontumor control samples, the median (M) of relative expression of mir-21 (2(-DeltadeltaCt)) was 5.770 (25th-75th percentile, 3.605-7.255) in the tumor samples, significantly higher than that of the nontumor control samples (set at 1.000, P\u003c0.001). Reduced PTEN protein expression was seen in 45% (18/22) of all cases. The expression of mir-21 was higher in the group of reduced PTEN expression (with an M of 6.800) than in the group of high PTEN expression (with an M of 4.850, P\u003d0.013). The up-regulated expression of mir-21 was positively correlated with the TNM clinical stage, lymph node positivity, and proliferation index (P\u003d0.021, 0.010, and 0.030 respectively).\nmir-21 plays an important role in the development and progression of breast cancer. PTEN is possibly one of the targets of mir-21.","title":"[Expression of microRNA-21 in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and its association with phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome expression and clinicopathologic features].","pubmedId":"19080492"}
