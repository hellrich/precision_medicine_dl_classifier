The present study was to test the availability of direct amplification of miRNAs from plasma without RNA extraction, and to evaluate its clinical application value in CRC.\nPlasma miR-21, miR-221 and miR-222 levels were determined in 103 CRC patients and 37 healthy normal controls by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical staining for p53, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) was carried out in the same CRC patient cohort. The correlation between miR-221 levels and protein levels of p53, CEA, ER and PR, clinicopathological features or overall survival was analyzed.\nA standard curve shows a good linearity between the log of sample input and C(T) values over three orders of magnitude of plasma miR-21, miR-221 and miR-222. ROC curve analysis reveals that the plasma levels of miR-221 is a potential biomarker for differentiating CRC patients from controls. Kaplan-Meier curve assessment shows that the elevated plasma miR-221 level is a significant prognostic factor for poor overall survival in CRC patients. The immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrates a significant correlation between plasma miR-221 level and p53 expression.\nThe direct amplification of plasma miR-221 can be used as a potential noninvasive molecular marker for diagnosis and prognosis of CRC and is correlated with p53 expression.","title":"Circulating miR-221 directly amplified from plasma is a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker of colorectal cancer and is correlated with p53 expression.","pubmedId":"20880178"}
