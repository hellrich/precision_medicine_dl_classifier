From a personal experience of 304 cervical carcinomas, the different techniques of laparoscopy used in cervical carcinomas are addressed and discussed. Their long-term results when involved in the management protocols of cervical carcinomas at different stages are reported. From this series, some conclusions are drawn: 1) laparoscopy can spare a laparotomy in early-stage node-negative patients with low tumoral volume; 2) it can spare a systematic extended-field radiation therapy in high-risk patients with node-negative para-aortic exploration; 3) it can spare surgery in patients with a centro-pelvic advanced stage or recurrence, possibly candidates for an exenterative procedure, if occult spread is found in the intra- or retroperitoneal areas. The more and more frequent combination of the mini-invasive surgery for staging and treatment and radiotherapy or chemotherapy explains the need for new protocols of a more and more complex and specialized management.","title":"[Role of laparoscopy in the management of uterine cervix cancer].","pubmedId":"10812356"}
