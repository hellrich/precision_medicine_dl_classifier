Doxorubicin (DOX) remains the cornerstone of chemotherapy in such individuals. However, it is often associated with cardiac failure, which once manifests carries a poor prognosis. Because BRCA2 regulates genome-wide stability and facilitates DNA damage repair, we hypothesized that loss of BRCA2 may increase susceptibility to DOX-induced cardiac failure. To this aim, we generated cardiomyocyte-specific BRCA2 knock-out (CM-BRCA2(-/-)) mice using the Cre-loxP technology and evaluated their basal and post-DOX treatment phenotypes. Although CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice exhibited no basal cardiac phenotype, DOX treatment resulted in markedly greater cardiac dysfunction and mortality in CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice compared with control mice. Apoptosis in left ventricular (LV) sections from CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice compared with that in corresponding sections from wild-type (WT) littermate controls was also significantly enhanced after DOX treatment. Microscopic examination of LV sections from DOX-treated CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice revealed a greater number of DNA double-stranded breaks and the absence of RAD51 focus formation, an essential marker of double-stranded break repair. The levels of p53 and the p53-related proapoptotic proteins p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and Bax were significantly increased in samples from CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice. This corresponded with increased Bax to Bcl-2 ratios and elevated cytochrome c release in the LV sections of DOX-treated CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice. Taken together, these data suggest a critical and previously unrecognized role of BRCA2 as a gatekeeper of DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and susceptibility to overt cardiac failure. Pharmacogenomic studies evaluating cardiac function in BRCA2 mutation carriers treated with doxorubicin are encouraged.","title":"BRCA2 protein deficiency exaggerates doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac failure.","pubmedId":"22157755"}
