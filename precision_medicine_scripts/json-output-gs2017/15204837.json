This model produces extreme unilateral panacinar emphysema closely resembling that encountered in patients with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. Because the contralateral lung remains functional, the animals can be maintained indefinitely. The model will be of value in developing imaging techniques capable of safely evaluating the effect of treatment on panacinar emphysema in alpha1-antitrypsin-deficient patients.","title":"A canine model for production of severe unilateral panacinar emphysema.","pubmedId":"15204837"}
