This study evaluated the use and efficacy of trastuzumab in routine treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Data from the clinical cancer registry Regensburg (Germany) were analyzed. The present study investigated 6,991 female patients with primary invasive breast cancer. In premenopausal HER2-positive patients a considerable increase of trastuzumab therapy was observed from 58.1% in 2006 to 90.9% in 2011, whereas in postmenopausal patients trastuzumab was rather used on a constant rate of 49.1%. Best overall survival (OS) was found in HER2/steroid hormone receptor-positive patients receiving guideline concordant treatment with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (CHT) plus antihormone therapy (AHT) with a 7-year OS rate of 96% compared to the non-trastuzumab group with a 7-year OS rate of 92%. In multivariable analysis, HER2-positive patients treated with CHT or AHT who did not get trastuzumab, had a worse 7-year OS (65%, P \u003d 0.006 versus 79%, P \u003d 0.017) than the control groups. This population-based study demonstrated that guideline concordant use of adjuvant trastuzumab improves OS for HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated in routine clinical care.
