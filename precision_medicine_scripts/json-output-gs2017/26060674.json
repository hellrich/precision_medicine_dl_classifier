The presence of diabetes was assessed by asking participants if the participants had ever been diagnosed with diabetes. Depression was measured using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale. Healthcare utilization was assessed by self-report. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed.\nDiabetes was positively associated with depression after controlling socioeconomic and health variables. Diabetic patients who had low socioeconomic status, who were obese, who were smokers, and who had higher numbers of chronic diseases had a higher depression risk. Diabetes and depression was associated with increased healthcare utilization. People with both diabetes and depression had significantly increased odds of multiple physician visits, multiple hospital admissions, and prolonged hospitalization compared with individuals with neither diabetes nor depression. Patients with both diabetes and depression had greater odds of multiple hospital admissions than patients with diabetes alone.\nWe found a positive association between diabetes and depression. Depression in persons with diabetes is associated with increased multiple hospital admissions. More research is warranted to clarify an association between co-occurring depression with diabetes and increased healthcare utilization.","title":"Depression, Diabetes, and Healthcare Utilization: Results from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA).","pubmedId":"26060674"}
