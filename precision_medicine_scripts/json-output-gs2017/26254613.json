This study aimed to determine correlations between clinical and pathological features and genetic phenotypes with the prognosis. We immunohistochemically examined the protein levels of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), Napsin A, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and genetically examined epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS mutations in these mucin-producing tumors. A total of 75 cases of mucin-producing adenocarcinoma of the lung were examined. ALK protein positivity was 33.3 % (25/75), and primarily occurred in solid predominant with mucin production subtype (SA). KRAS mutations occurred in 22.7 % (17/75) of patients, predominantly in invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA). Positive TTF-1 and Napsin A expression was more common in SA, while they were both negative in IMA. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival rates of mucin-producing lung adenocarcinoma were 85, 64, and 38 %, respectively; the overall survival rates were 90, 67, and 50 %, respectively. Larger tumors, advanced stage, and lymph node metastasis were associated with poor prognosis. Mucinous minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (m-MIA) had the best prognosis, followed by IMA, SA, and acinar or papillary predominant adenocarcinoma with mucin production (A/P). KRAS mutations were an independent positive prognostic factor for postoperative progress.
