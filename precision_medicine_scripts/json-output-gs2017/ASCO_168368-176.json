High frequency of actionable genomic alterations has been reported in cohorts from different regions worldwide. Particularly in Asian cohorts, rates of clinically relevant mutations reach almost 90% of LANS. However, great variance between different geographic regions was found. In Brazil, the molecular profile of LANS is unknown. Methods: Consecutive cases of never-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma treated at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from 2011 to 2013 were selected. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and genotyped for 409 cancer-related genes by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). All patients had been previously tested for EGFRmutations in Exons 18-21 either by Sanger or RT-PCR in a clinical laboratory. In tumours without a targetable alteration, a gene fusion panel was performed. Results: Sixteen patients had tumour block available for genotyping. The 409 NGS gene-panel detected 53 individual actionable mutations (median 3 per sample; range 0-10) in 15 (out of 16) tumours. The most commonly mutated genes were EGFR (15%,n \u003d 8 of 53), STED2 (9%,n \u003d 5 of 53), TP53 (7%,n \u003d 4 of 53) and ERBB3 (7%,n \u003d 4 of 53). Six cases (37%) harboured EGFR sensitizing mutations (1 L858R; 5 exon 19 deletions), some of which had not been previously detected by other technologies. The fusion panel identified 2 additional EML4-ALK rearrangements. No overlap was found between classic driver alterations. Overall, twelve out of 16 patient samples tested (75%) harboured a genomic alteration with a target agent based on NCCN guidelines (2 EGFR L858R; 6 EGFR exon 19 deletions; 2 ERBB2 mutations, 2 EML4-ALK). All four remaining patients without a oncogenic mutation considered targetable by NCCN, had at least one actionable genomic alteration identified. Conclusions: A broad genomic testing approach revealed a high prevalence of clinically relevant genetic alterations in Brazilian never-smoker with lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Molecular profile of lung adenocarcinoma in Brazilian never-smokers.","pubmedId":"ASCO_168368-176"}
