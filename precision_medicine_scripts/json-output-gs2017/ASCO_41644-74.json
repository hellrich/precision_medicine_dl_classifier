Prior meta-analyses did not address the role of opposed versus unopposed HRT specifically. We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize the relative risks (RR) of CRC due to E versus EP. Methods: From a total of 2,317 articles identified from PubMed and EMBASE, 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 13 observational studies were eligible for analyses. We considered these variables: study year/size/design/population, duration and recency of HRT use, method of exposure assessment, and outcome definition and ascertainment. RR were synthesized by random-effects models. Results: E was associated with a marginally significant decreased risk of CRC (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-1.00). Adding progesterone significantly strengthened this association (RR 0.74, 0.67-0.82, p value for the difference between E and EP \u003d 0.01). We found significant heterogeneity for E, but not for EP studies. Several factors were predictive of lower RR in the E arm and can potentially explain the heterogeneity, including current use, case-control design, and HRT exposure assessed by self-report (see Table). Recency was less important for the association between EP and CRC risk. Conclusions: There is consistent evidence supporting the association between EP and CRC risk reduction. While literature for the effect of E on CRC risk is inconclusive, our analyses suggest only current use of E is associated with a decreased CRC risk.
