The alteration of components of this pathway, through either activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors, disrupts a signaling equilibrium and can thus lead to cellular transformation. The frequent dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in human cancer has made components of this pathway attractive for therapeutic targeting; however, a more comprehensive understanding of the signaling intricacies is necessary to develop pharmacological agents to target not only specific molecules, but also specific functions. Here, we review a series of experiments examining the contribution of molecules of this signaling network including PI3K, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10, integrin-linked kinase and Akt and address the significance to human breast cancer.","title":"The phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase signaling network: implications for human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"17322919"}
