What makes it worse is the incidence keeps increasing worldwide, including in China. Notably, clinical studies revealed the distinct features in the Chinese population differing from those in Caucasians, which give hints to variant mechanisms underlying. Therefore, it is of great importance to generate a cell line with similar background for melanoma research in Chinese even Asian patients. However, most melanoma cell lines in use are derived from Caucasians, thus, we established one novel metastatic melanoma cell line, FLFMM-34, derived from a Han Chinese woman. The cell line showed positive for S100, HMB45, vimentin and melan-A. Chromosome analysis revealed multiple structural aberrations. Gene-mutation analysis identified that FLFMM-34 cells had BRAF(V600E) mutation and deletions of exon 2 and 3 in p16/CDKN2A. Importantly, two novel mutations including TP53(P33R) and TP53(R142H) have been detected. RT-PCR results showed that FLFMM-34 cells expressed a higher mRNA level of cyclinD1 than three other melanoma cell lines, WM793B, 1205Lu and A2058. In addition, in vivo mice model demonstrated that the cells could be transplanted into the subcutis of nude mice and produced tumors associated with lymphoid node metastases. In conclusion, these data indicate that FLFMM-34 cell line can be employed as a suitable model for melanoma research in Chinese Han population.
