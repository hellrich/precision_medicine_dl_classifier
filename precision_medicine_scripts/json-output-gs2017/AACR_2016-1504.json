Our aim is to identify therapeutic targetable targets in endometrial cancer. We focused on fusion transcripts whose inhibitors show impressive activity in some tumors and have analyzed RNA-sequencing data and DNA copy number data from 25 endometrial cancer cell lines to identify potential therapeutically targetable fusion transcripts. We have identified 124 high-confidence fusion transcripts, of which 69% are associated with gene amplifications but have not detected recurrent fusion transcripts. We performed Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR amplification products and validated 27 (93.1%) of the 29 fusion transcripts that were randomly selected. As targetable fusion candidates, we extracted three in-frame kinase fusion transcripts that retain a kinase domain (CPQ-PRKDC, CAPZA2-MET, and VGLL4-PRKG1). We detected only CPQ-PRKDC fusion transcript in three of 122 primary endometrial cancer tissues. Cell proliferation of the fusion-positive cell line was inhibited by knocking down the expression of wild-type PRKDC but not by blocking the CPQ-PRKDC fusion transcript expression. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of the CPQ-PRKDC fusion transcript was significantly lower than that of wild-type PRKDC, corresponding to a low transcript allele fraction of this fusion, based on RNA-sequencing read counts. Western blotting did not show the detectable protein level of the CPQ-PRKDC similar to CAPZA2-MET, and VGLL4-PRKG1. In endometrial cancers, the CPQ-PRKDC fusion transcript may be a passenger aberration related to gene amplification. In conclusion, we have described the landscape of fusion transcripts in endometrial cancer by using RNA-sequencing data. We could not identify therapeutically targetable kinase fusions in a small set of 25 endometrial cancer cell lines. Our findings suggest that the transcript allele fraction is a good predictor for determining bona fide targetable fusion transcripts when applying fusion detection methods that use RNA-sequencing data.","title":"Identification of novel kinase fusion transcripts in endometrial cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1504"}
