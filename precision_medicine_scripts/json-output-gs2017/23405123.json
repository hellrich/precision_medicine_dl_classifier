Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to determine the prognostic influence of DM on survival endpoints.\nColorectal cancer patients with DM had significantly worse disease-free survival (DFS) [hazard ratio (HR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.37] compared with patients without DM. When considering colon and rectal cancer independently, DM was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.11-1.92), DFS (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.15-1.84) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 0.98-1.76) in colon cancer patients. No association for OS, DFS or RFS was observed in rectal cancer patients. There was significant interaction of location of tumor (colon vs. rectal cancer) with DM on OS (P \u003d 0.009) and DFS (P \u003d 0.007).\nThis study suggests that DM negatively impacts survival outcomes of patients with colon cancer but not rectal cancer.","title":"Impact of diabetes on oncologic outcome of colorectal cancer patients: colon vs. rectal cancer.","pubmedId":"23405123"}
