Because of the fear of tumor spread, IAT has rarely been used in case of malignancy. We report our experience with patients who underwent hemipancreatoduodenectomy for carcinoma and later completion pancreatectomy for pancreatic fistula with islet autotransplantation at our institution.\nFrom August 2007 to December 2012, 5 patients underwent IAT after completion pancreatectomy for pancreatic fistula after hemipancreatoduodenectomy for carcinoma. Islets were isolated from the pancreatic tail with the use of digestion with collagenase. Nonpurified islet suspension was infused into the portal vein during surgery.\nThe median number of islets transplanted was 175,000 islet equivalents (range, 70,000-365,000). One patient died after surgery for reasons unrelated to IAT. Another 3 patients had stable diabetes with partial graft function (fasting C-peptide levels 0.23, 0.41, and 0.61 nmol/L and HbA1c 4.8%, 4.6%, and 6.9% at 24, 24 and 9 months after IAT, respectively). The 1st patient, with pancreatic head carcinoma, was alive 28 months after IAT with lymph node and liver recurrence since 18 months after IAT. The 2nd patient, with gall bladder and distal bile duct carcinoma, died 47 months after IAT with tumor recurrence. The 3rd patient, with ampullary carcinoma, died 12 months after IAT with local recurrence and solitary liver metastasis. The last patient had been off insulin 9 months after IAT without tumor recurrence (fasting C-peptide, 0.89 nmol/L; HbA1c, 4.2%).\nAutotransplantation of pancreatic islets isolated from the residual pancreatic tissue in patients who previously underwent hemipancreatoduodenectomy for cancer may provide stable glucose control and thus improve quality of life. In this small series we did not observe early development of multiple liver metastases caused by islet suspension contamination with malignant cells. Oncologic outcome of the patients was not worse than what would be expected without IAT.","title":"Pancreatic islet autotransplantation after completion pancreatectomy for pancreatic fistula after hemipancreatoduodenectomy for carcinoma.","pubmedId":"25131092"}
