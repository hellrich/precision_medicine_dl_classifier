In an effort to identify the oncogenes in the region that are targeted by the amplification process, we determined the structure of the amplicon in breast cancer cell lines and tumors. Physical and transcription maps of the approximately 3.5-Mb region were established and used as the basis for copy number analysis within the region by Southern blot and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Seven specific and independent amplification maxima were identified in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumors. We present correlative amplification and overexpression studies for the FLJ21316 and Hs.6649 genes suggesting a role for these candidates as amplification-dependent oncogenes.","title":"Structural analysis of the 17q22-23 amplicon identifies several independent targets of amplification in breast cancer cell lines and tumors.","pubmedId":"11431322"}
