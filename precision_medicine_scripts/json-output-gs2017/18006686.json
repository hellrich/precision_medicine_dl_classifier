Although cancer-derived cyclin D1 mutants are potent oncogenes in vitro and in vivo, the mechanisms whereby they contribute to neoplasia are poorly understood. We now provide evidence derived from both mouse models and human cancer-derived cells revealing that nuclear accumulation of catalytically active mutant cyclin D1/CDK4 complexes triggers DNA rereplication, resulting from Cdt1 stabilization, which in turn triggers the DNA damage checkpoint and p53-dependent apoptosis. Loss of p53 through mutations or targeted deletion results in increased genomic instability and neoplastic growth. Collectively, the data presented reveal mechanistic insights into how uncoupling of critical cell cycle regulatory events will perturb DNA replication fidelity, thereby contributing to neoplastic transformation.","title":"Nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 during S phase inhibits Cul4-dependent Cdt1 proteolysis and triggers p53-dependent DNA rereplication.","pubmedId":"18006686"}
