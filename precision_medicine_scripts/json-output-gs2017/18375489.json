We assayed DNA extracted from human tumors and detected PIK3CA mutation frequencies of 10.2% in colorectal cancer, 38.7% in breast cancer, 1.9% in lung cancer, and 2.9% in melanoma. In contrast, sequencing detected only 53% of the mutations detected by our assay.\nMultiplexed assays, which can easily be applied to clinical samples, have been developed for the detection of PIK3CA mutations.","title":"Multiplexed assays for detection of mutations in PIK3CA.","pubmedId":"18375489"}
