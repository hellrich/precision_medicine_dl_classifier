The NF2 meningiomas showed more mitotic figures (p \u003c 0.001) and nuclear pleomorphism (p \u003d 0.003) than the sporadic meningiomas; however, the incidence of meningothelial, fibroblastic, and transitional subtypes occurred equally in both groups. The proliferation potential was significantly higher in the 35 meningiomas removed from 23 patients with NF2 than in the 30 sporadic meningiomas removed in the 30 patients without NF2 (mean MIB-1 labeling indices: 2.5 vs. 1.75, p \u003d 0.0147). The higher proliferation potential of the NF2 meningiomas may reflect differences in molecular biology between sporadic and NF2 meningiomas and may be related to an earlier onset, multiplicity, and more aggressive behavior of NF2 tumors.","title":"Proliferation potential and histological features in neurofibromatosis 2-associated and sporadic meningiomas.","pubmedId":"9322850"}
