The resulting hybrid oncogenes are found in PTCs with variable frequency, depending on the examined population. The relationship between these chromosomal aberrations and clinical outcome of PTCs remains still controversial. The study aimed at estimating the frequency of rearrangements of RET and/or NTRK1 protooncogenes in PTC in the Polish population, and at evaluating the possible relationships between the presence of RET and/or NTRK1 oncogenes and such parameters, as patient\u0027s age, gender, histopathological variant of tumor and clinical staging. Expression analysis of RET and NTRK1 was performed by duplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (duplex RT-PCR) and OneStep RT-PCR, respectively, in tumor tissues obtained from 33 patients with PTC. Rearrangements of the RET protooncogene (RET/PTC1, RET/PTC2 and RET/PTC3) were detected in 7 out of 33 PTC (21%), and rearrangements of NTRK1 [Trk-T1 and Trk(TPM3)] were detected in 4 out of 33 examined samples (12%). In none of the examined cases, did the RET and NTRK1 rearrangements occur in the same sample. No correlations were found between RET/PTC or Trk oncogenic sequences and patient\u0027s age, gender, the histopathological variant of PTC and the assignment to particular stage in clinical staging systems (TNM Staging, the University of Chicago clinical class, and Ohio State University Staging). Our study is the first one in which the frequency of NTRK1 rearrangements in PTC was reported for the Polish population. On the other hand, the frequency of RET rearrangements in PTC, as found by us, was similar to the previously reported results for the Polish population. Our results do not confirm the relationship between the structural aberrations in question and the clinical outcome of PTC.","title":"Molecular analysis of the RET and NTRK1 gene rearrangements in papillary thyroid carcinoma in the Polish population.","pubmedId":"16483615"}
