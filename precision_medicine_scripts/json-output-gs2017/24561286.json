This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism of PDAC and identify biologically active small molecules capable of targeting the sub-pathways which were dysregulated in the development of PDAC.\nThe gene expression profile of GSE28735 microarray data (including 45 matching pairs of pancreatic tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues) was downloaded from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pancreatic tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues were identified, and then the sub-pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Moreover, an approach based on targeting sub-pathways was used to reveal potential agents for PDAC.\nA total of 5315 DEGs were identified between pancreatic tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues with a false discovery rate of 0.01. Genes of collagen family and integrin receptor family which were involved in pathways of focal adhesion and ECM-receptor interaction respectively were differentially expressed in the pancreatic tumor tissue. Besides, a total of 85 small molecules including fludrocortisone, latamoxef and metronidazole were revealed by bioinformatics analysis.\nThis study proposed the use of an approach based on targeting sub-pathways to identify potential agents for PDAC. The sub-pathways and small molecules discovered in this study were not only related to PDAC but also play a role in perturbing the development of PDAC.","title":"Candidate agents for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma identified by a sub-pathway based method.","pubmedId":"24561286"}
