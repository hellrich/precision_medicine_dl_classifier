The calcification was preoperatively demonstrated by ultrasonography and computed tomography. On the cut surface of the resected specimen of the pancreas tail, calcification was observed in the central part of the ductal adenocarcinoma. Although calcification is not uncommon in chronic pancreatitis or serous cystadenoma, mucinous cystadenoma/adenocarcinoma, solid and cystic tumor, and islet cell tumor, intratumoral calcification is uncommon in an ordinary ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. For differential diagnosis from other conditions associated with calcification, careful examinations are necessary.","title":"Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas associated with intratumoral calcification.","pubmedId":"7642976"}
