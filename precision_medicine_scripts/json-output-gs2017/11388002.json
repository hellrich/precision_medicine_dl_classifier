Vibratory stimulation was unsuccessful. electroejaculation was done under general anaesthesia. A silicone catheter was used to tamponade the bladder neck and antegrade ejaculations were collected. The semen underwent seminological assessment and then was diluted 1:1 in egg yolk substrate containing 15% glycerol, equilibrated, divided into straws and frozen in nitrogen. The straws were then placed for storage in liquid nitrogen until the insemination.","title":"[Electroejaculation--effectiveness in a patient after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection--case report].","pubmedId":"11388002"}
