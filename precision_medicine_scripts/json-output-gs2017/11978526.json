Evidence for immune reactivity has been found in several preclinical models and the prognostic value of some of these immune responses have been reported. The possible mechanisms are discussed. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies is still experimental; as previously described benefit of treatment with monoclonal antibodies could not be confirmed. Labelled monoclonal antibody therapy has produced mixed results and also need further investigation. Several antigens are used in active specific immunotherapy (ASI). Its targets and modifications are discussed, as are their use in clinical studies. Although some of the results are promising, the results still have to be confirmed in larger studies. Since there is sufficient evidence for immune reactivity in CRC, further research on immunotherapeutic strategies is justified and will be focused on the development of humanised antibodies, the search for other relevant T-cell epitopes and ways to induce a more effective T cell response.","title":"Biological therapy of colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"11978526"}
