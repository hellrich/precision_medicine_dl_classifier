These B7-1+ and B7-2+ APC bound CTLA-4 fusion protein. In lesional (but not in nonlesional) skin, keratinocytes expressed BB-1. The majority of infiltrating T cells were CD28+. B7-1 and B7-2 RNA were expressed in lesional skin from SLE, SCLE, and CDLE patients; when dermis was separated from epidermis, only faint B7-1 and B7-2 RNA signals were detectable in the epidermis, indicating that dermal but not epidermal cells were the major source of B7-1 and B7-2 RNA. During treatment, both B7-1 and B7-2 protein and RNA expression were reduced.\nThese in situ findings suggest that costimulation via the B7-CD28 pathway may be important for the generation and/or propagation of T cell activity in skin lesions of humans with lupus erythematosus. Thus, the manipulation of this pathway (e.g., by CTLA-4 fusion protein) could be an important target for the development of future therapies for LE.","title":"In situ expression of B7 and CD28 receptor families in skin lesions of patients with lupus erythematosus.","pubmedId":"9153541"}
