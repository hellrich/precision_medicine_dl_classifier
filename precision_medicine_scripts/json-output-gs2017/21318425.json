The present population-based study was undertaken to determine the incidence of colorectal cancer in Kashmiri population which is non-migratory and ethnically homogeneous having stable food habits.\nOver a period of one year, all newly diagnosed and histological proved cases of colorectal cancer in all possible areas, where such patients are diagnosed and treated were prospectively registered.\nA total of 212 cases of colorectal cancers were registered; of them 113 (53.3%) originated in the colon and other 99 (46.7%) in rectum. Male to female ratio was 1.2:1. The crude incidence rate of colorectal cancer was 3.65/100,000; it was 3.78 in males, and 3.50/100,000 in females. The incidence rates for colorectal cancer in Muslims and Hindus were different. The crude incidence rate for colorectal carcinoma was highest for district Srinagar 6.19/100,000 (urban area) and lowest for district Kupwara (rural area) 1.59/100,000. The highest numbers of cases were detected in the age group 55-59 years (n \u003d 34). The age-specific rate for colorectal carcinoma was highest in the age group 55-59 years (17.21/100,000), followed by 65-69 years (14.86/100,000). The age standardized incidence rate was 4.52/100,000 per year. The truncated age adjusted incidence rates in age group 35-64 years was 8.31/100,000; while that for colorectal carcinoma was 8.77/100,000 in males and 7.66/100,000 in females.\nWe conclude that the incidence of colorectal cancer in Kashmir valley is similar to that reported in the rest of India.","title":"Incidence of colorectal cancer in Kashmir valley, India.","pubmedId":"21318425"}
