However, the association of SNP309 with hepatocellular carcinoma is unknown. We evaluated the association of SNP309 with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development among Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.\nWe genotyped the SNP309 at the MDM2 promoter in 435 Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, including 187 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 48 healthy subjects, using a fluorogenic PCR. Presence of SNP was also confirmed by direct sequencing of the MDM2 promoter region.\nThe proportion of G/G genotype of the SNP309 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (33%) was significantly higher than that in patients without hepatocellular carcinoma (23%), with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.28 (1.30-3.98). A multivariate analysis revealed that MDM2 SNP309 (G/G versus T/T), age \u003e60 years, male gender, presence of cirrhosis, serum alpha-fetoprotein \u003e20 mug/L, and serum albumin \u003c3.2 g/dL were independently associated with the hepatocellular carcinoma development at odds ratio of 2.27, 2.46, 3.08, 4.15, 4.87, and 6.33, respectively.\nThe MDM2 promoter SNP309 is associated with the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C.","title":"MDM2 promoter SNP309 is associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis C.","pubmedId":"16914573"}
