Aberrant transcripts of TSG101 have been identified in 47% of primary breast carcinomas, without evidence of intragenic deletions at the TSG101 locus on 11p15. To investigate the possible role of TSG101 in lung cancer, which often shows 11p allele loss, we performed transcript analysis and mutational analysis of TSG101 in lung cancer cell lines. Reverse transcriptase RT-PCR and Northern analysis detected a common TSG101 transcript, shortened because of an internal deletion, which was expressed simultaneously with the wild-type transcript in 89% of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) lines. In contrast, the wild-type transcript was expressed alone in normal tissues, primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens, and the majority of NSCLC cell lines. Sequence of the shortened SCLC transcript was identical to that of the most common aberrant transcript identified in breast cancer, consisting of a deletion of exons 2-4 and part of 1 and 5. Southern analysis of SCLC lines expressing the shortened transcript did not detect any intragenic deletions. Single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing of TSG101 cDNAs also identified no mutations or deletions. These results suggest that TSG101 is not mutated in lung cancer but that aberrant splicing of TSG101 occurs in SCLC.","title":"TSG101 is not mutated in lung cancer but a shortened transcript is frequently expressed in small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"9764824"}
