Cancer risks in men who were found to harbor a BRCA1 (n \u003d 150) or a BRCA2 (n \u003d 88) mutation or both (n \u003d 2) were assessed by cross referencing with data on cancer occurrence in the Israeli National Cancer Registry. Incidence rates in mutation carriers were compared with men who were counseled, genotyped, and found not to harbor the familial mutation (true negative n \u003d 122), and with standardized incidence rates (SIRs). Of 210 cancer-free individuals at initial counseling, 11 cancers were diagnosed after a mean follow-up of 5.06 Â± 4.1 years (1064 person/years) compared with 1/122 in a BRCA true-negative man. The SIR for all BRCA1/2 mutation carriers compared with the rates in the general population were elevated for pancreatic cancer [2.97 (95 % CI 1.83-4.29)] and breast cancer [16.44 (95 % CI 9.65-26.24)]. For prostate cancer these rates were 0.59 (95 % CI 0.4-0.84). Jewish BRCA1/2 mutation carriers are at an increased risk for breast and pancreatic, but not prostate cancer. These cancer risks and the consequent recommendations, if validated, should be transmitted to carriers at test result disclosure.","title":"Cancer risks in Jewish male BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.","pubmedId":"25788227"}
