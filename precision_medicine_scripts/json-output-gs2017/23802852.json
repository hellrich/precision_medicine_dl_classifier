Biomarker testing is critical to personalized therapy in lung adenocarcinoma and has been extensively investigated in non-Hispanic whites, Asians, and African Americans. However, little information addresses the underlying genetic changes in lung adenocarcinoma among Hispanic patients in the United States.\nTo identify targetable biomarkers other than EGFR and EML4-ALK in Hispanic patients with lung adenocarcinoma.\nWe tested DNA extracted from 85 lung adenocarcinoma specimens collected from 40 Hispanic and 43 non-Hispanic white patients for previously reported mutations in KRAS, MET, BRAF, mTOR, STAT3, JAK2, PIK3CA, AKT1 through AKT3, and PTEN with a custom Sequenom massARRAY assay (Sequenom, San Diego, California).\nMutations in KRAS were identified in 11 cases (13%; 6 Hispanic [7%], 5 non-Hispanic white [6%]) and had no correlation with sex, age, or smoking history. Mutations in PIK3CA were identified in 2 of the 40 Hispanic patients (5%), including one patient (2.5%) with a concurrent KRAS mutation. The tumors were wild type for all other genes tested.\nTargetable biomarkers other than EGFR and EML4-ALK were identified in 7 of the 40 Hispanic patients (18%) and 5 of the 43 non-Hispanic white patients (12%), suggesting a similar mutational frequency. Our highly multiplexed genotyping assay detected actionable mutations in 14% (12 of 83) more patients than would have been identified by EGFR and EML4-ALK testing alone.","title":"Lung adenocarcinoma biomarker incidence in Hispanic versus non-Hispanic white patients.","pubmedId":"23802852"}
