To search for potential interactions between the products of these breast cancer susceptibility genes, we undertook systematic mapping of BRCA2 for potential phosphorylation sites by CHEK2. In vitro kinase assays and mass spectrometric analysis identified a 50 amino-acid fragment within the N-terminus of BRCA2 potentially targeted by CHEK2, containing two major phosphopeptides. Inducible overexpression of this peptide, but not a derivative with mutated phosphorylation sites, leads to increased chromosome fragmentation and suppression of cellular proliferation. These results suggest a link between CHEK2 and BRCA2 pathways, which may contribute to the spectrum of cancers associated with germline CHEK2 mutations.","title":"In vitro phosphorylation of BRCA2 by the checkpoint kinase CHEK2.","pubmedId":"18797466"}
