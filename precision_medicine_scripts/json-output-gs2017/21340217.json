Patients had undergone conservative surgery for breast cancer with immediate breast reconstruction (n \u003d 25) or without breast reconstruction (n \u003d 25) at least one year before the study. The control group consisted of 25 women without cancer, but of similar age and educational level distribution as the other two groups. The Beck Depression Inventory was used to measure depression. The collected data were assessed using analysis of variance and the χ² test.\nThere were no significant differences between groups in age (p \u003d 0.72) or educational level (p \u003d 0.20). A smaller number of patients had undergone the menopause (p \u003d 0.02) in the control group than in other groups. There were no significant differences in occurrence of depression between groups (χ² \u003d 9.97; p \u003d 0.126). CONCLUSÍON: Conservative surgery for breast cancer did not affect the occurrence of depression in women, regardless of whether breast reconstruction was performed.","title":"Depression and conservative surgery for breast cancer.","pubmedId":"21340217"}
