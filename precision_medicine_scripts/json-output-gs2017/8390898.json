A chest X-ray showed a peripheral pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe, that was diagnosed as small cell lung cancer following histological examination of the pulmonary tissue specimen, obtained with transbronchial biopsy. After establishing the central origin of the diabetes insipidus, its cause was revealed by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, that demonstrated metastasis to the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal area.","title":"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus: an unusual clinical presentation of small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"8390898"}
