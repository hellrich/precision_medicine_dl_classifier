Immediate downstream consequences of this activation are currently indistinguishable from those obtained with growth factors (GF), e.g. stimulation of the pro-proliferative mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). To identify potential differences, the effects of GFs and radiation on other members of the ErbB family have been compared in mammary carcinoma cell lines differing in their ErbB expression profiles. Treatment of cells with EGF (ErbB1-specific) or heregulin (ErbB4-specific) resulted in a hierarchic transactivations of ErbB2 and ErbB3 dependent on GF binding specificity. In contrast, radiation indiscriminately activated all ErbB species with the activation profile reflecting that cell\u0027s ErbB expression profile. Downstream consequences of these ErbB interactions were examined with MAPK after specifically inhibiting ErbB1 (or 4) with tyrphostin AG1478 or ErbB2 with tyrphostin AG825. MAPK activation by GFs or radiation was completely inhibited by AG1478 indicating total dependance on ErbB1 (or 4) depending on which ErbB is expressed. Inhibiting ErbB2 caused an enhanced MAPK response simulating an amplified ErbB1 (or 4) response. Thus ErbB2 is a modulator of ErbB1 (or 4) function leading to different MAPK response profiles to GF or radiation exposure.","title":"The relative role of ErbB1-4 receptor tyrosine kinases in radiation signal transduction responses of human carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"11313882"}
