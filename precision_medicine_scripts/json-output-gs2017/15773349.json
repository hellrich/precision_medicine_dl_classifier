Several clinical trials of prostate cancer gene therapy are currently underway, using therapeutic genes which include suicide genes, immunomodulatory genes, tumor suppressor genes and anti-oncogenes. Although the gene therapy for prostate cancer as a clinical alternative is still early stage which requires several technological breakthrough, some information obtained from clinical trial indicates full potential of prostate cancer gene therapy. Concordant progress both in the basic research and gene therapy technology will make prostate cancer gene therapy ready for wide scale of practice in the future. In this report, general concept and current progress in prostate cancer gene therapy are summarized.","title":"[Prostate cancer gene therapy].","pubmedId":"15773349"}
