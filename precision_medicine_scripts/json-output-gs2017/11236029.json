Lung cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer are common epithelial tumors in which clinical trials are currently in progress to explore the potential therapeutic role for monoclonal antibodies to HER-2/neu (trastuzumab [Herceptin; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA]). In preclinical studies with tumor cell lines, trastuzumab was found to have additive and synergistic effects with some chemotherapeutic agents. Clinical trials investigating combination chemotherapy with trastuzumab and a variety of chemotherapeutic agents are already in progress in lung cancer.","title":"HER-2/neu as a therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer.","pubmedId":"11236029"}
