Surgery and radiation remain the cornerstones of the therapy, however, the burgeoning knowledge of tumor biology has facilitated the entry of systemically administered therapies into the clinic. This review mainly summarizes the current applications of these data to surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. \n脑是非小细胞肺癌常见的转移部位，手术和放疗是以往脑转移治疗的基石，但近年来随着对肿瘤发生发展机制的认识深化，靶向治疗在脑转移治疗中开始崭露头角。本文主要针对一些相关热点问题如脑转移治疗手段等（手术、放疗、化疗、靶向治疗）进行简要述评。","title":"[Advances in treatment of brain metastases from primary non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"25539615"}
