The objective response rate (ORR) for patients with adenocarcinoma (primary endpoint) was 5% (2 partial responses; 1-sided P \u003d .372 for null hypothesis [H0 ]: ORR â‰¤ 5%) and 6% (1 partial response) for patients with nonadenocarcinoma. Responders included: 2 of 25 EGFR mutation-positive tumors; 1 of 3 EGFR wild-type with HER2 amplification. Median progression-free survival was 12 weeks overall (n \u003d 66) and 18 weeks (n \u003d 26) for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors. Common treatment-related adverse events were of grade 1 or 2 severity, manageable with standard supportive care, and included diarrhea (grade 3 [G3], 12%), acneiform dermatitis (G3, 6%), exfoliative rash (G3, 3%), dry skin (G3, 0%), fatigue (G3, 3%), and stomatitis (G3, 2%). Six patients (9%) discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events. By patient report, NSCLC symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and pain (chest, arm/shoulder) showed improvement first observed after 3 weeks on therapy.\nDacomitinib demonstrated preliminary activity and acceptable tolerability in heavily pretreated patients, and may offer benefit in molecularly defined patient subsets.","title":"A phase 2 trial of dacomitinib (PF-00299804), an oral, irreversible pan-HER (human epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitor, in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy and erlotinib.","pubmedId":"24501009"}
