A retrospective assessment, in one center, over a period of 1 year. Only malignant pancreatic neoplasm diagnosed by EUS-FNA was recorded. Benign (serous cystic neoplasm) and potentially malignant lesions (mucinous cystic neoplasm and intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm) were excluded. Medical data were recorded and Oncological Pharmacy records were studied. Ductal adenocarcinoma were detected in 17 patients (N \u003d 17/22), 2 of them with adenocarcinoma in signet ring and 1 with mucinous adenocarcinoma. The primary therapies used were as follows: Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy (3), biliary stent by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (3), radiological transhepatic percutaneous stent (2), intestinal bypass (2), and a gastric stent (1). The adjuvant drugs used were gemcitabine (10), erlotinib (3), and cetuximab (1), and also radiotherapy was used (1). An unresectable squamous cell carcinoma (N \u003d 1) of the tail was detected, and gemcitabine + vinorelbine + fluorouracil + cisplatin used. Nonfunctioning neuroendocrine tumors were seen in 3 (N \u003d 3) cases and long-acting somatostatin analogues were used (1); the remaining 2 patients showed resectable tumors and were resected accordingly. A metastasis to the pancreatic head in a hepatocellular carcinoma was found in 1 patient (N \u003d 1), allowing specific treatment with sorafenib. Histopathologic analysis with EUS-FNA implies a variety of different treatments. Optimal management was achieved as a result of improved diagnosis, with the advent of new molecular genetic diagnostic methods facilitating the design of specific new therapy and neoadjuvant targeting strategies.","title":"Types of pancreatic cancer in EUS-FNA and chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"20019588"}
