Recent studies have shown that Notch signal is associated with drug resistance. However, the exact mechanism of Notch during acquisition of resistance to EGFR-TKI in human lung cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we showed that the expression of Notch-1 was highly upregulated in EGFR-TKI acquired resistant lung cancer cells. More importantly, Notch-1 contributed to the acquisition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, which was critically associated with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI. Silencing of Notch-1 using siRNA resulted in mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), which was associated with impaired invasion and anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer and resensitisation to gefitinib in acquired resistant NSCLC cells. Finally, gefitinib treatment of Balb/c nu/nu with acquired resistant lung cancer xenografts in combination with Notch inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-(S)-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) resulted in effective tumour growth retardation, with decreased proliferative activity and increased apoptotic activity. Collectively, these data suggest that Notch-1 might play a novel role in acquired resistance to gefitinib, which could be reversed by inhibiting Notch-1.","title":"Notch-1 contributes to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor acquired resistance in non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo.","pubmedId":"23916913"}
