Case 1 is a 36-year-old woman and case 2 is a 35-year-old woman. Grossly, the cervix of both cases showed markedly barrel shaped enlargement with an infiltrating tumor. Microscopically, well-differentiated atypical glands were infiltrating into the entire thickness of the cervix. The ovarian masses in case 1 were diagnosed as metastatic carcinoma in mucinous cystadenoma with tumorlets of SCTATs of the ovaries. Multiple scattered tumorlets of SCTATs were also found in the ovary of case 2. By direct DNA sequencing analysis, a frame shift mutation of the STK11/LKB1 gene was identified in case 1. Case 1 represented the more aggressive clinical course, and although the patient received additional combined chemo-radiation therapy, she expired 1 year later. In general, mutation of the STK11/LKB1 gene is associated with poor clinical outcome in malignant tumors accompanied by Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","title":"Minimal deviation adenocarcinoma of the cervix and tumorlets of sex-cord stromal tumor with annular tubules of the ovary in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","pubmedId":"23346318"}
