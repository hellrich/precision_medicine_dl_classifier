The state of emergency of tuberculosis caused by the resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, became the main threat to the tuberculosis treatment and control programs. A fast detection method for the resistant strains will allow the implementation of an adequate treatment and contribute for controlling the dissemination of these resistant strains. This study evaluated the performance of the nitrate reductase assay in solid (NRA-LJ) and liquid (NRA-7H9) media, to determine the susceptibility to first line anti-tuberculosis drugs: isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (SMR). Both methods NRA-LJ and NRA-7H9 were evaluated among 18 strains with a known susceptibility profile. The resazurin microtiter assay (REMA) was performed as a reference method. One hundred percent of accordance was observed between NRA-7H9 and REMA for the four tested drugs. When the NRA-LJ method was compared to REMA, the sensitivity and the specificity to INH, RMP, EMB and SMR were 100%, 100 %, 85.7%, 76.9% and 80%, 100%, 75% and 80%, respectively. From the 57 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis evaluated by NRA-7H9 and REMA, 56 (98.2%) were sensitive to all antibiotics tested (INH, RMP, EMB and SMR) by the NRA-7H9 method, while three of these strains were resistant to INH by REMA. One strain showed resistance to INH and RMP for both methods, and MIC of 1.0 μg/ml to INH for both methods, while MIC of 1.0 and 2.0 μg/ml to RMP for REMA and NRA-7H9, respectively. The three assays showed a high level of agreement for rapid detection of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance. Regarding rapidness, the detection of color change in the NRA method is within instants as compared to the overnight incubation required for the REMA test. NRA might represent an inexpensive and alternative assay for rapid detection of resistance in low-income countries.
