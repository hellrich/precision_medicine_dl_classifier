However, not all EGFR mutations have similarly high clinical response rates. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and response to gefitinib in lung adenocarcinoma patients with complex EGFR mutations.\nThree hundred thirty-nine specimens of lung adenocarcinoma from patients treated with gefitinib were collected for EGFR sequencing. Nineteen patients with complex EGFR mutations were enrolled for the study after excluding three patients with the EGFR T790M mutation, which confers resistance to gefitinib.\nAmong the 19 patients, 12 had complex mutations with the classical mutation pattern (L858R or deletion in exon 19). When compared with those without the classical mutation pattern, patients with this mutation pattern had a higher response rate (83% versus 29%), longer progression-free survival duration (median, 12.7 months versus 4.9 months), and longer overall survival time (median, 24.7 months versus 12.3 months) after gefitinib treatment. Comparing patients harboring complex EGFR mutations with a classical mutation pattern with those harboring single classical mutations, there were no statistical differences in the response rate (83% versus 73%), progression-free survival time (median, 12.7 months versus 8.1 months,) or overall survival time (median, 24.7 months versus 16.4 months).\nPatients with complex EGFR mutations with the classical mutation pattern had the same response rate, progression-free survival duration, and overall survival time as those with single classical mutations. EGFR TKIs may be the choice of treatment for this type of lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Good response to gefitinib in lung adenocarcinoma of complex epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations with the classical mutation pattern.","pubmedId":"19060236"}
