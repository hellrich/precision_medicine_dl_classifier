Here, we set out to investigate the role of microRNA 138 (miR-138-5p) in the regulation of pancreatic cancer cell growth and to assess its role as putative therapeutic target.\nqRT-PCR was used to examine the expression of miR-138-5p in 8 pancreatic cancer cell lines and 18 primary human pancreatic cancer samples. A lentivirual vector containing miR-138-5p mimics (lv-miR-138-5p) was used to exogenously over-express miR-138-5p in the pancreatic cancer cells lines Capan-2 and PANC-1. The effect of this over-expression on cell proliferation was examined using an in vitro propidium iodide fluorescence assay. Capan-2 cells exogenously over-expressing miR-138-5p were transplanted into nude mice to examine its in vivo effect on tumor growth. A predicted target of miR-138-5p (FOXC1) was first validated using a luciferase assay and, subsequently, down-regulated by siRNA to assess its effect on pancreatic cancer cell growth.\nWe found that miR-138-5p was markedly down-regulated in both pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary human pancreatic cancer samples, compared to a human pancreas ductal epithelial (HPDE) cell line and normal pancreatic tissues, respectively (P \u003c 0.05). In addition, we found that in the pancreatic cancer cells lines Capan-2 and PANC-1 lentiviral transfection of miR-138-5p mimicked up-regulation of the endogenous expression of miR-138-5p and, concomitantly, inhibited cancer cell proliferation (P \u003c 0.05). The exogenous over-expression of miR-138-5p also led to a significant inhibition of tumor formation in vivo. Using a luciferase assay, we found that miR-138-5p directly targets FOXC1. In conformity with this notion, we found that FOXC1 was down-regulated upon miR-138-5p over-expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, we found that silencing of FOXC1 by siRNA had an inhibitory effect on pancreatic cancer cell growth.\nOur data indicate that miR-138-5p may play an important role in regulating pancreatic cancer cell growth, possibly through targeting FOXC1. Over-expression of miR-138-5p may serve as a novel approach for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.","title":"MicroRNA-138-5p regulates pancreatic cancer cell growth through targeting FOXC1.","pubmedId":"25875420"}
