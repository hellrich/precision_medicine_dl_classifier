Preoperative treatment regimens, clinicopathologic characteristics, operative details, and long-term outcomes in four successive time periods (1990-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014) were evaluated and compared.\nThe average number of patients per year who underwent PD following preoperative therapy as well as the proportion of operations performed for borderline resectable and locally advanced (BR/LA) tumors increased over time. The use of induction systemic chemotherapy, as well as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, also increased over time. Throughout the study period, the mean EBL decreased while R0 margin rates and vascular resection rates increased overall. Despite the increase in BR/LA resections, locoregional recurrence (LR) rates remained similar over time, and overall survival (OS) improved significantly (median 24.1, 28.1, 37.3, 43.4 months, respectively, p \u003c 0.0001).\nDespite increases in case complexity, relatively low rates of LR have been maintained while significant improvements in OS have been observed. Further improvements in patient outcomes will likely require disruptive advances in systemic therapy.","title":"Preoperative Therapy and Pancreatoduodenectomy for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: a 25-Year Single-Institution Experience.","pubmedId":"27778257"}
