One hundred and twenty-eight patients who             failed first-line chemotherapy drug treatment were divided into a mutation and             a non-mutation group according to the presence or absence of epidermal growth             factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Each patient received closed drainage combined             with simple negative pressure suction after thoracoscopic talc poudrage pleurodesis             and oral Tarceva treatment. Short-term and long-term clinical therapeutic effects             of Tarceva were evaluated. The EGFR mutation rate in pleural metastatic tissues             of lung adenocarcinoma acquired through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was             higher compared to that in surgical resection specimens, plasma specimens and             pleural effusion specimens compared to previously reported results. There were             significant statistical differences in the average extubation time (p\u003c0.01),             drainage volume of pleural effusion (p\u003c0.05), Karnofsky score and formation             of encapsulated pleural effusion 4 weeks after surgery (p\u003c0.05) between these             two groups. The number of patients with mild pleural hypertrophy in the mutation             group was significantly higher compared to the non-mutation group (p\u003c0.01),             while the number of patients with severe pleural hypertrophy was significantly             reduced (p\u003c0.05). There was significant statistical discrepancy between these             two groups in terms of improvement of peripheral blood carcinoembryonic antigen             and tissue polypeptide antigen after 4 weeks of therapy. The complete remission             rate and the efficacy rate were higher in the mutation group compared to that             in the non-mutation group (p\u003c0.05). There was a longer overall survival time             after Tarceva treatment in patients with EGFR mutations than those without EGFR             mutation. EGFR mutations predict a favorable outcome for malignant pleural effusion             of lung adenocarcinoma with Tarceva therapy. Detection of EGFR mutations may determine             the responsiveness of malignant pleural effusion to Tarceva treatment.","title":"EGFR mutations predict a favorable outcome for malignant pleural effusion             of lung adenocarcinoma with Tarceva therapy.","pubmedId":"22134479"}
