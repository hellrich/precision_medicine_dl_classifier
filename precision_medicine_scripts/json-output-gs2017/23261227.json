In this study, we evaluated metabolic and metastatic features of lung adenocarcinoma by using FDG PET/CT, with regard to specific genotypes of ALK and EGFR mutation.\nPatients with lung adenocarcinoma initially diagnosed and examined with FDG PET/CT and molecular genotyping with biopsy specimen, from September 2009 to September 2011, were selected retrospectively. ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization and EGFR mutations were tested. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and metastatic characteristics on FDG PET/CT were analyzed with regard to ALK and EGFR status.\nOf the 331 lung adenocarcinoma patients, 18 were ALK positive (ALK(+)), 156 were EGFR mutation positive (EGFR(+)), and 157 were wild type (WT) for both ALK and EGFR mutation. The ALK(+) tumor showed significantly higher SUVmax and more common metastasis to lymph nodes and distant organs than those of other genotypes in overall patients (P\u003c0.01). In a subgroup analysis of advanced stage (stage IIIb and IV), ALK(+) lung cancer showed significantly higher SUVmax (P\u003c0.05) than EGFR(+) tumors. In another subgroup analysis of size matched groups, ALK(+) tumors showed significant difference in SUVmax, lymph node and distant metastasis (P\u003c0.01), particularly in the moderate-sized tumors (1.5-3cm).\nALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma represents higher glucose metabolism and more rapid metastasis to lymph nodes or distant sites compared with those with EGFR mutation and wild type, which suggests more aggressive features of ALK rearrangement.","title":"Metabolic and metastatic characteristics of ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma on FDG PET/CT.","pubmedId":"23261227"}
