Associations of cisplatin with vindesine or etoposide have been overall superior to combinations of older cytostatic agents. These combinations result in an average of 30-40% objective response rate with 5% complete responses. High doses of cisplatin seem to be associated with optimal results. Vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin, methyl-GAG and dihydrogalactitol appear to be promising in combination with cisplatin.","title":"Progress in chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"6209142"}
