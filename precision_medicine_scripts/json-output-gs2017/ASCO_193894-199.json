Synergistic anti-tumor activity with paclitaxel was observed in pre-clinical testing, and a favorable clinical safety profile was established in a phase I/II trial in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors. A phase 1b trial was established to evaluate the safety and preliminary signs of anti-cancer activity of the combination regimen in pts with advanced melanoma. Methods: Pts with melanoma were enrolled after failure of standard therapies for advanced disease. Napabucasin 480 or 500 mg orally twice daily was administered with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV weekly for 3 of every 4 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated using CTCAE v4.03 and objective tumor assessments were obtained every 8 weeks and evaluated per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Results: A total of 12 pts with advanced melanoma were enrolled after a median 3 prior lines of therapy (including immune checkpoint inhibitors, BRAF-inhibitor if presence of BRAF V600E mutation). Protocol therapy was well tolerated with grade 3 AEs including diarrhea (n \u003d 3), abdominal pain (n \u003d 1), and fatigue (n \u003d 1). Partial response (PR) was observed in 1 pt. Stable disease of at least 24 weeks or more was achieved by 33% of patients (n \u003d 4) and the median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 3.7 months. Prolonged survival of 1 year or more was achieved by 33% of pts (n \u003d 4), with a median overall survival (mOS) of 10.4 months. Conclusions: Napabucasin plus weekly paclitaxel has shown clinical safety and encouraging anti-tumor activity in a cohort of pts with previously treated advanced melanoma. The RP2D in combination with weekly paclitaxel was established to 480 mg orally bid. The data suggest that targeting stemness pathways with napabucasin may be a novel therapeutic strategy for melanoma.
