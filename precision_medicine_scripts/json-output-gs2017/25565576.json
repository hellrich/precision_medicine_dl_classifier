Interleukin-2 (IL2) is recognized as a key regulatory molecule, which enhances the activity and growth of the immune effector cell function. High-Dose IL2 Therapy is an option for treatment of malignant melanoma but has frequent, often serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects. Here we investigated the effect of genetically modified ADSCs (GM-ADSCs) expressing IL2 in immunocompetent mouse models of subcutaneous and lung metastatic melanoma. Prior to in vivo studies, we demonstrated that IL2 produced by GM-ADSCs may act as a growth factor for melanoma cells due to the increased viability and reduced apoptosis of melanoma cells after in vitro treatment. Subcutaneous co-injection of IL2-expressing ADSCs with melanoma cells significantly enhanced the melanoma tumor growth. Furthermore, histological analysis of subcutaneous tumors for IL2 and Melan-A (a melanocytic differentiation marker) confirmed that most of cells in melanoma/IL2-ADSC co-injected tumors are melanoma cells, not IL2-ADSCs. In pulmonary metastases model, melanoma cells were injected intravenously and 10 days later mice were treated by systematical injection of GM-ADSCs. Intravenously injected IL2-ADSCs engrafted into melanoma lung tumors but were unable to reduce melanoma lung metastases. Besides, administered IL2-ADSCs significantly reduced systemic CD4+ cells and did not impact the total survival of lung metastases melanoma bearing mice. In conclusion, this study showed that IL2-producing ADSCs can favor B16F10 melanoma cell proliferation. Therefore, therapies utilizing IL2 have to be taken into careful consideration.
