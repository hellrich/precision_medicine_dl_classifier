The Rb gene protein positive-expression rate in the tumor tissue was 50%, which was also lower than that in the adjacent pancreatic tissue (P\u003c0.05). The PCNA positive-expression rate was 71.87%, which was higher than that in the adjacent pancreatic tissue (P\u003c0.05). PCNA positive-expression was also correlated significantly with tumor cell differentiation and lymph node metastasis (P\u003c0.05).\nThe decreased expression of p27(kip1), Rb protein and over-expression of PCNA may play an important role in the genesis and progression of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Expression of p27(kip1), Rb protein and proliferating cell nuclear antigen and its relationship with clinicopathology in human pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"14607668"}
