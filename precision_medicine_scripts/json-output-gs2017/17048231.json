Using a cutoff EGFR level of 44.1 ng/mL from the control group (5% nonparametric method), 53 of 535 patients (10%) had decreased serum levels of EGFR. Patients with decreased serum EGFR had no significant difference in objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), time to progression (TTP), or time to treatment failure (TTF); however, they did have significantly reduced survival compared with patients who had normal serum EGFR levels (median survival, 23.3 months vs. 30.9 months; P \u003d .007). A combined analysis of pretreatment serum EGFR and HER-2 yielded no additional predictive information for ORR, CBR, TTP, or TTF compared to serum HER-2 alone. However, in the current analysis, a subgroup of patients who had decreased serum EGFR and normal serum HER-2 was identified (n \u003d 39 of 535 patients; 7.3%) that had significantly reduced survival compared with patients who had normal serum levels of both EGFR and HER-2 (median survival, 23.5 months vs. 37.1 months; P \u003d .005). In multivariate analysis, a decreased serum EGFR level remained a significant independent prognostic factor for decreased survival (hazards ratio, 1.58; P \u003d .007).\nIn patients who had metastatic breast cancer, decreased serum EGFR/normal serum HER-2 predicted shorter survival compared with patients who had normal levels of serum EGFR/HER-2. This patient subgroup deserves further study to assess their response to and selection for anti-EGFR-directed therapies.","title":"Serum epidermal growth factor receptor/HER-2 predicts poor survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer.","pubmedId":"17048231"}
