The p85 alpha locus was only present in hybrids retaining the human chromosome 5q. The presence of the p85 beta locus coincided with the presence of chromosome 19. The precise chromosomal sublocalization of these two genes was then determined by in situ hybridization. We confirmed the localization of the p85 alpha gene at 5q12-q13, as recently described (Cannizzaro, L.A., Skolnik, E.Y., Margolis, B., Croce, C.M., Schlesinger, J. \u0026 Huebner, K. (1991). Cancer Res., 51, 3818-3820) and positioned the p85 beta locus at 19q13.2-q13.4.","title":"Chromosomal localization of human p85 alpha, a subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and its homologue p85 beta.","pubmedId":"1314371"}
