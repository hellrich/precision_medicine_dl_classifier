The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with synchronous second primary lung cancer was comparable to that of patients with single-lung cancer (51.4 vs. 48.7%, p \u003d 0.755). The overall 5-year survival rate after the first tumor resection in patients with metachronous second primary lung cancer was significantly better than that of patients with single-lung cancer (85.4 vs. 48.7%, p \u003d 0.003), but was not significantly different after the second tumor resection (77.0 vs. 48.7%, p \u003d 0.057).\nSurgically resected second primary lung cancer had a survival comparable with single-lung cancer. Histologic concordance between the first and second tumors, and the pathological stage were important prognostic factors in second primary lung cancer.","title":"Clinical outcomes and prognostic factors for surgically resected second primary lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22411753"}
