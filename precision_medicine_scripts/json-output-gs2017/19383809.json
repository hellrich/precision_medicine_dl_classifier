Immunohistochemical detection of EML4-ALK has proved difficult, however, likely as a result of low transcriptional activity conferred by the promoter-enhancer region of EML4. The sensitivity of EML4-ALK detection by immunohistochemistry should be increased adequately.\nWe developed an intercalated antibody-enhanced polymer (iAEP) method that incorporates an intercalating antibody between the primary antibody to ALK and the dextran polymer-based detection reagents.\nOur iAEP method discriminated between tumors positive or negative for EML4-ALK in a test set of specimens. Four tumors were also found to be positive for ALK in an archive of lung adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 130) and another 4 among fresh cases analyzed in a diagnostic laboratory. These 8 tumors were found to include 1 with EML4-ALK variant 1, 1 with variant 2, 3 with variant 3, and 2 with previously unidentified variants (designated variants 6 and 7). Inverse reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the remaining tumor harbored a novel fusion in which intron 24 of KIF5B was ligated to intron 19 of ALK. Multiplex reverse transcription-PCR analysis of additional archival tumor specimens identified another case of lung adenocarcinoma positive for KIF5B-ALK.\nThe iAEP method should prove suitable for immunohistochemical screening of tumors positive for ALK or ALK fusion proteins among pathologic archives. Coupling of PCR-based detection to the iAEP method should further facilitate the rapid identification of novel ALK fusion genes such as KIF5B-ALK.","title":"KIF5B-ALK, a novel fusion oncokinase identified by an immunohistochemistry-based diagnostic system for ALK-positive lung cancer.","pubmedId":"19383809"}
