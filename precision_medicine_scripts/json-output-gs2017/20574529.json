The results were graded according to the positive ratio and intensity of tissue immunoreactivity. The expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in meningioma was analyzed by its relationship with WHO2007 grading, invasion, peritumoral edema and postoperative recurrence.\nThe positive rates of E-cadherin in meningioma WHO I, II, III were 92.69%, 33.33% and 0, respectively, (P\u003c0.05); while the positive rates of beta-catenin in meningioma WHO I, II, III were 82.93%, 33.33% and 20.00%, respectively, (P\u003c0.05). The positive rate of E-cadherin in meningioma without invasion (94.12%) was higher than that with invasion (46.67%) (P\u003c0.05). The difference in the positive rate of beta-catenin between meningioma without invasion (88.24%) and meningioma with invasion (33.33%, P\u003c0.05) was also statically significant. The positive rates of E-cadherin in meningioma with peritumoral edema 0, 1, 2, 3 were 93.75%, 85.71%, 60.00% and 0 respectively, (P\u003c0.05); the positive rates of beta-catenin in meningioma with peritumoral edema 0, 1, 2, 3 were 87.50%, 85.71%, 30.00% and 0 respectively, (P\u003c0.01). The positive rates of E- cadherin in meningioma with postoperative recurrence were 33.33%, and the positive rate with postoperative non-recurrence was 90.00% (P\u003c0.01). The positive rates of beta-catenin in meningioma with postoperative recurrence and non-recurrence were 11.11%, 85.00%, respectively (P\u003c0.01).\nThe expression levels of E- cadherin and beta-catenin correlated closely to the WHO 2007 grading criteria for meningioma. In atypical or malignant meningioma, the expression levels of E-cadherin and beta-catenin were significantly lower. The expression levels of E- cadherin and beta-catenin were also closely correlated with the invasion status of meningioma, the size of the peritumoral edema and the recurrent probabilities of the meningioma, all in an inverse correlationship. Taken together, the present study provided novel molecular targets in clinical treatments to meningioma.","title":"The potential involvement of E-cadherin and beta-catenins in meningioma.","pubmedId":"20574529"}
