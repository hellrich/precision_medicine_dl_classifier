Notwithstanding surgery and radiotherapy, a subset of patients will manifest recurrent meningioma. Systemic therapy is recommended only when further surgery and radiotherapy are not possible. No prospective study with a high level of evidence is available to inform as to recommendations regarding systemic therapy.\nWe aim to summarize systemic therapies for recurrent meningioma. Expert commentary: Hydroxurea, temozolomide, irinotecan, the combination of cyclophosphamide/adriamycine/vincristine, interferon-alpha, somatostatin analogs, mifepristone, megestrol acetate, imatinib, erlotinib and gefitinib are considered as having limited efficacy. Potential activity of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitors such as sunitinib, valatinib, and bevacizumab is suggested in small non-controlled studies and requires validation in randomized trials. The identification of new prognostic markers such as TERT promoter mutations and potential new therapeutic targets, such as KLF4, AKT1, TRAF7, and SMO mutations hopefully facilitate this endeavor.","title":"Systemic therapy for recurrent meningioma.","pubmedId":"27123883"}
