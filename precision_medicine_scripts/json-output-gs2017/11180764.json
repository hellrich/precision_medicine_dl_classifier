There are two types of tests to detect c-erbB-2 amplification/overexpression: immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Accurate identification of cases with c-erbB-2 amplification/overexpression requires an optimized combination of immunohistochemical and FISH tests.","title":"Prognostic and predictive value of c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu) gene amplification in human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"11180764"}
