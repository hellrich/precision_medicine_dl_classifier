This 6-year-old male who had previously undergone total removal of a cerebellar medulloblastoma was admitted because of new tumoral masses in the abdominal wall and the nuchal area. Ultrasound imaging demonstrated that both lesions were in the subcutaneous tissue. Both tumors were in the vicinity of the surgical incisions, which implies that they were implanted during previous procedures. Pathologic examination of the tumors obtained from gross surgical resection revealed medulloblastoma but with less advanced differentiation compared with the primary neoplasm. This report discusses unusual pure limited subcutaneous metastases of medulloblastoma. The objective of this report is to bring into consideration this presentation of medulloblastoma to the neurologic differential diagnosis.","title":"Pure subcutaneous seeding from medulloblastoma.","pubmedId":"14629911"}
