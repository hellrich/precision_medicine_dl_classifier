Methylation‑specific polymerase chain reaction and SYBR Green reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the methylation status and the mRNA expression levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), O6‑methylguanine‑DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), the tumor suppressor genes P73, P53, GADD45G, CHFR and THBS1, the transcription factor CEBPA, the proto‑oncogenes KRAS, NRAS and C‑myc and EGFR in 24 nasal tumor tissue samples and 20 normal nasal epithelia tissue samples. The associations between promoter methylation and DNMT, and promoter methylation and mRNA expression of the genes were analyzed. The results indicated that the expression levels of DNMT1 increased by 56% compared with those in normal nasal epithelial tissues, while MGMT, DNMT3a and DNMT3b had similar expression levels in the two tissue types. The expression levels of P53 decreased by 36.8% and those of THBS1 by 43%, while C‑myc increased by 2.9‑fold and CEBPA by 2‑fold compared with that in normal nasal epithelial tissues. GADD45G, P73, CHFR and NRAS were observed to have similar expression levels in the two tissue types. However, no expression was observed for EGFR and KRAS. CHFR, GADD45G and THBS1 were identified to be methylated in tumor suppressor genes. The methylation expression rate of the CHFR gene was ~60% in the two tissue types and for THBS1 it was 100% in the nasal tumor tissues as opposed to 20% in the normal nasal epithelial tissues. The exhaustive methylation expression rate of GADD45G was 62.5% and the partial methylation expression rate was 37.5% in nasal tumor tissue, while no methylation was observed in normal nasal epithelial tissues. C‑myc was the only gene identified to be methylated amongst proto‑oncogenes. The methylation expression rate of C‑myc was 87.5% in nasal tumor tissues and 15% in normal nasal epithelial tissues. The methylation expression rate of CEBPA was 100% in nasal tumor tissues and 40% in normal nasal epithelial tissues. The methylation expression rate of the EGFR gene was ~80% in the two tissues. In summary, the present study identified abnormal methylation of the C‑myc, CEBPA, GADD45G and THBS1 genes in nasal tumor tissues. The expression levels of DNMT1, C‑myc and CEBPA were upregulated and the expression of P53 and THBSI were downregulated in nasal tumor tissues, with a significant difference between the two groups (P\u003c0.05). Therefore, it is suggested that these six genes may be used as diagnostic marker candidates for ENT. The results may serve as a foundation for screening of tumor‑specific markers for early diagnosis of ENT and further investigate the epigenetic mechanisms of enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV)‑induced nasal epithelium cell carcinoma.","title":"Promoter methylation, mRNA expression of goat tumor‑associated genes and mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferase in enzootic nasal tumors.","pubmedId":"26252527"}
