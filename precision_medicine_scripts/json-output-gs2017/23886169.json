There were 9 cases of mutations in exon 20, 7 in exon 19 and 2 in exon 21. Mutations were more frequently observed in women (5/7 pts, 71.4%) than in men (13/41 pts, 31.7%) (p\u003d0.086) and in non-smokers (5/5 pts, 100%) than smokers (13/43 pts, 30.2%). There was negative correlation of EGFR mutations with smoking status (p\u003d0.005). EGFR mutations were more frequently observed with adenocarcinoma histology (13/32 pts, 40.6%) than in other types (5/16 pts, 31.3%) (p\u003d0.527). The patients with EGFR mutations had better survival than those with wild- type EGFR (p\u003d0.08). There was no association of EGFR mutations with metastatic spread.\nEGFR mutations in NSCLC were here demonstrated more frequently in females, non-smokers and adenocarcinoma histology in the western region of Turkey. Patients with EGFR mutations have a better prognosis.","title":"Relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations and clinicopathological features in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in western Turkey.","pubmedId":"23886169"}
