We investigated messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in H358 (formerly bronchioloalveolar carcinoma) and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549) by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.\nMultivariate analysis showed that prognostic factors for lung adenocarcinoma were histologic type, CLDN1, T stage and N stage. Patients with positive CLDN1 expression had a poorer prognosis than patients with negative CLDN1 expression. CLDN1 expression was correlated with Ras and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. Patients with positive expressions of both CLDN1 and Ras/EGFR had a poorer prognosis than patients with CLDN1 (+) Ras/EGFR(-) or CLDN1 (-) Ras/EGFR(+) and patients with negative expressions of both CLDN1 and Ras/EGFR. CLDN1 mRNA expression was lower in the H358 compared with the lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549).\nThe combination of CLDN1 and Ras/EGFR is a valuable independent prognostic predictor for lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Claudin-1 correlates with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27766775"}
