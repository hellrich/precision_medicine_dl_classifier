However, resistance to TKIs emerges in almost all patients and currently no effective treatment is available. Here, we show that β-catenin is essential for development of EGFR-mutated lung cancers. β-Catenin was upregulated and activated in EGFR-mutated cells. Mutant EGFR preferentially bound to and tyrosine phosphorylated β-catenin, leading to an increase in β-catenin-mediated transactivation, particularly in cells harboring the gefitinib/erlotinib-resistant gatekeeper EGFR-T790M mutation. Pharmacologic inhibition of β-catenin suppressed EGFR-L858R-T790M mutated lung tumor growth, and genetic deletion of the β-catenin gene dramatically reduced lung tumor formation in EGFR-L858R-T790M transgenic mice. These data suggest that β-catenin plays an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and that targeting the β-catenin pathway may provide novel strategies to prevent lung cancer development or overcome resistance to EGFR TKIs.","title":"β-catenin contributes to lung tumor development induced by EGFR mutations.","pubmedId":"25164010"}
