To detect cancer-specific somatic mutations in two hot-spot regions of PIK3CA gene, the helical and kinase domains (encoded by exons 9 and 20, respectively) in GBM and AA, the authors examined the respective sequences 31 paraffin-embedded samples (23 GBM and 8 AA). The samples were obtained from a group of Iranian patients affected with high-grade glioblastoma (HGG). The overall prevalence of PIK3CA mutations was 23% (7/31) for both tumor types (22% in GBM, and 25% in AA). Five mutations were detected in exon 20, p.Arg992Gln (c.2976G→A), p.Met1005Val (c.3014A→G), p.Ile1019→Val (c.3056A→G), p.Ser1008Cys (c.3024C→G), and p.Asn1044Asp (c.3130A→G), and one mutation in exon 9, p.Glu545Ala (c.1634A→C). Additionally exons 4-8 of P53 gene in four unrelated young patients, who showed no mutations in PIK3CA exons 9 and 20, were analyzed. Three mutations were identified: p.Pro72Ala (c.214C→G), g.11608G→T (homozygote splice mutation), and p.Thr170Thr (c.510G→A silent mutation). In conclusion, mutation detection in PIK3CA in patients with a high degree of malignancy and early age at diagnosis should be included in molecular diagnostic protocols, also with regard to possible upcoming therapies.","title":"High frequency of mutations in the PIK3CA gene helical and kinase coding regions in a group of Iranian patients with high-grade glioblastomas: five novel mutations.","pubmedId":"22026810"}
