Diverse tumor types are able to produce ACTH ectopically, including small cell lung carcinoma. Ectopic ACTH secretion by malignant neoplasm has been reported to have earlier and more aggressive metabolic effects. We report a 59-year-old male patient with severe hypertension, metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia as the first clinical manifestations of an ACTH-secreting small cell lung carcinoma, although the typical phenotypic features of Cushing\u0027s syndrome were not present. Ectopic Cushing\u0027s syndrome should always be ruled out in patients with severe hypertension and hypokalemia.","title":"Severe hypertension and hypokalemia as first clinical manifestations in ectopic Cushing\u0027s syndrome.","pubmedId":"18820819"}
