To investigate further the potential role of this gene in mammary carcinogenesis, we examined 69 primary breast cancers for mutations in PTEN/MMAC1 by means of polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analysis. We detected only one somatic missense mutation, a change from T to C at codon 59 (TCA to CCA) resulting in substitution of Pro for Ser in the predicted protein. This site is located outside of phosphatase or phosphate-acceptor motifs, but this codon encodes a residue that is conserved in homologous proteins, tensin and auxilin and is likely to be crucial for normal function of PTEN/MMAC1. Among the 69 tumors examined, three low-frequency polymorphisms were found as well, one in the non-coding region of exon 1 and one each in introns 2 and 7. Our results suggested that mutation of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene is not a major factor in the development of most primary breast cancers.","title":"Infrequent mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene among primary breast cancers.","pubmedId":"9510470"}
