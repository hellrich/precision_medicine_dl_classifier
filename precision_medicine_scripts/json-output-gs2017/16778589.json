Liver transplantation represents the potentially curative treatment for small HCC. Recurrence after surgical resection and liver transplantation remains one of the major obstacles in further prolonging survival of patients with HCC. In the new liver, HCC might be of recipient or donor origin. One approach for investigating this question is by performing human identification and/or engraftment analysis. Distinction between recurrent and de novo HCC after orthotopic liver transplantation could allow for the development of important clinical and therapeutic strategies. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of highly polymorphic short tandem repeat DNA sequences, gene expression profiling, and fluorescence in situ hybridization were applied in a patient who developed a second HCC after orthotopic liver transplantation from an opposite gender donor. These techniques provided consistent evidence that the second HCC was a recurrence of the primary tumor.","title":"Molecular techniques for identifying HCC origin and biology after orthotopic liver transplantation.","pubmedId":"16778589"}
