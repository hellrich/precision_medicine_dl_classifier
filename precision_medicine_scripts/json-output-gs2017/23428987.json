In this in-vitro pilot study we have derived a volatile fingerprint assay for representative genetic mutations in cancer cells that are known to be associated with targeted cancer therapy. Five VOCs were associated with the studied oncogenes, using complementary chemical analysis, and were discussed in terms of possible metabolic pathways. The reported approach could lead to the development of novel methods for guiding treatments, so that patients could benefit from safer, more timely and effective interventions that improve survival and quality of life while avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures. Studying clinical samples (tissue/blood/breath) will be required as next step in order to determine whether this cell-line study can be translated into a clinically useful tool.\nIn this novel study, a new concept for profiling genetic mutations of (lung) cancer cells is described, based on the detection of patterns of volatile organic compounds emitted from cell membranes, using an array of nano-gold based sensors.","title":"Volatile fingerprints of cancer specific genetic mutations.","pubmedId":"23428987"}
