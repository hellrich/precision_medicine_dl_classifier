Recent preclinical and translational evidence suggest its role in conditioning KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas aggressiveness and response to targeted treatment.Materials and methods: This retrospective analysis, in a single center, included consecutive NSCLC patients who had undergone a platinum-containing regimen, for which standard or next generation (NGS) sequencing analyses of STK11 gene (exons 1-9) had been successfully performed. STK11 gene was considered mutated if effect on protein was predicted as deleterious. Clinical features along with EGFR (exons 18-21), KRAS (exons 2-4) and TP53 (exons 1-11) mutational status were correlated to STK11 status. Kaplan-Meier methods, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models were used for survival analysis, adjusting for stage (advanced yes/no) and histology for progression-free survival (PFS), and smoking status, stage, EGFR/KRAS status and number of lines of chemotherapy for overall survival (OS).Results: Among the 302 patients included between November 2007 and January 2015, 63% were male, 16% non-smoker and median age was 60 year; 75% had an adenocarcinoma, 88% a stage IIIB or IV and 80% no previous treatment for advanced disease; 25 (8%) patients had a STK11 mutation, 30 (10%) an EGFR mutation and 81 (27%) a KRAS mutation. Deletions/insertions, missense and false-sense mutations mainly involved exon 4-6 of STK11. No statistical differences were observed between STK11 status and sex, smoking status, age, stage at diagnosis or histology (adenocarcinoma versus others). Among the 25 patients with STK11 mutation, 13 patients (52%) had a KRAS mutation, compared with 67 (24%) among those without STK11 mutation (p \u003d 0.008). No correlation between STK11 and EGFR or TP53 mutational status was observed. Median follow-up time was 34.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI95]: 30.7-42.3). In univariate analysis, OS was shorter for STK11 mutated patients compared to wild type ones (p \u003d 0.085; HR: 1.53; CI95: 0.94-2.49) with a median OS of 10.4 (CI95: 6.1-15.7) and 17.3 (CI95: 14.0-21.1) months for mutated and wild-type STK11 patients respectively. In multivariate analysis, the HR was 1.21 (CI95: 0.74-1.99; p \u003d 0.45). Similar non-significant results were observed for PFS.Conclusion: We confirm the reported data of a positive correlation between STK11 and KRAS mutations. No correlation between STK11 status and PFS or OS in patients receiving platinum-based treatment was observed when taking into account other prognostic covariates.","title":"STK11 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): descriptive analysis and prognostic significance","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2250"}
