The investigational agent, panitumumab, is an anti-epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody that improves progression-free survival in chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Recently, both KRAS mutational status (i.e., mutated or not) and subtype (i.e., activating or inactivating) have been shown to be predictive of response to anti-EGFR therapy in mCRC. However, in NSCLC, it is unknown if KRAS mutational status or subtype predict benefit to anti-EGFR therapies because of unique genetic and epigenetic factors unique to each cancer. We present a patient with stage III NSCLC containing a KRAS G12D activating mutation who had a partial pathologic response, with disappearance of a minor KRAS mutant clone. This case suggests possible eradication of the G12D KRAS lung cancer clones by concurrent chemoradiation with panitumumab.
