Several mechanisms underlying have been discovered, here we would report a rare resistant mechanism of histology mutual transformations. Methods: From July 2013 to June 2015, we retrospectively collected 135 NSCLC patients who were in resistance with TKI treatments. Patients clinical data including pathologic result, gene status, demographic information, clinical staging, and treatment were recorded.[YL1]Results: Among the 135 NSCLC patients, we found two cases of lung cancer with histological transformation from adenocarcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma, one case from squamous cell carcinoma to adenocarcima after TKI treatment. These cases still harbored sensitive epidermal growth factor gene mutations and developed acquired resistance T790M mutation. Conclusions: Histologic evolution may be a mechanism associated with TKI resistance .","title":"Mutual transformation between adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_191749-199"}
