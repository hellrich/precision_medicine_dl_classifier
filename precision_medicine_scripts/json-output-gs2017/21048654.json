{"genes":["neurofibromatosis 2","NF2","NF2"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"The co-existence of meningioma and schwannoma as 2 distinct histologic components within the same tumor has been described in neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), but the co-existence of both tumors without evidence of NF2 is much rarer. Here, we are reporting a case of mixed schwannoma with meningioma without clinical evidence of NF2. In an adult Saudi lady with progressive left-sided hearing loss, left cerebellopontine tumor was diagnosed by MRI, and the histopathological diagnosis revealed that this tumor was composed of vestibular schwannoma and meningioma. This case is discussed with literature review.","title":"Mixed vestibular schwannoma and meningioma without neurofibromatosis.","pubmedId":"21048654"}
