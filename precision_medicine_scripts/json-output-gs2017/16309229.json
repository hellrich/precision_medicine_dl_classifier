Alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists also inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in malignant prostatic cells. The apoptotic activity is independent of their capacity to antagonize alpha-adrenoceptors. The effect of doxazosin on the growth of prostate and bladder cancer cell lines was assessed and whether the growth inhibitory effect of doxazosin on prostate cancer cells is serotonin (5-hydroxtryptamine; 5HT)-dependent was investigated.\nPC3 (androgen-independent prostate cancer) and HT1376 (grade III transitional cell carcinoma) cells were plated. The cells were incubated with doxazosin. After 72 h, cell viability was assessed (crystal violet assay). Studies were also performed after incubating the PC3 cells with 5HT or 5HT(1B) agonists for a short duration, followed by the addition of doxazosin. Cell viability was assessed at 72 h.\nDoxazosin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PC3 and HT1376 cell growth with a maximum inhibition of 80% (n\u003d12, p \u003c 0.0001) and 91% (n\u003d12, p \u003c 0.0001), respectively, at a concentration of 10(-4)M, at 72 h. Incubation of PC3 cells with 5HT or 5HT(1B) agonist, followed by addition of doxazosin, increased the percent of viable cells as compared to when the cells were treated with doxazosin alone.\nDoxazosin significantly inhibited prostate (PC3) and bladder cancer (HT1376) cell growth. Furthermore, prior incubation of PC3 cells with 5HT or 5HT(1B) agonist increased cell viability as compared to treatment with doxazosin alone. These findings may be related to the similarity between subtype 1 serotonin and adrenergic receptors. The effect of alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists on tumour cell growth merits further investigation.","title":"Growth inhibitory effect of doxazosin on prostate and bladder cancer cells.
