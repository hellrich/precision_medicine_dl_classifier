Gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901) and cisplatin-resistant cell line (SGC-7901/DDP) were cultivated in vitro, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were utilized to determine the expression profiles of miR-34a and survivin in both gastric cancer cell lines. With miR-34a mimic and miR-34a inhibitor transfected into SGC-7901 and SGC-7901/DDP for 48 h, post-transfection changes of miR-34a expression was determined; the effects of miR-34a ectopic expression on the viability of cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cell were assayed by the MTT method. The effects of miR-34a ectopic expression on apoptosis of cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cell were determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining method and flow cytometry. The effects of miR-34a ectopic expression on the AKT and p-AKT expression of cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cells were determined by Western blot and flow cytometry with the PI3K pathway inhibitor Wortmannin. As shown by qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, the expression of miR-34a in cisplatin-resistant cell lines decreased significantly in comparison to that of SGC-7901 cell line (p \u003c 0.05), while significant up-regulation of survivin expression was also observed (p \u003c 0.05). Compared with the control group, the expression of miR-34a increased significantly in SGC-7901 cells transfected with miR-34a mimic for 48 h (p \u003c 0.01). After miR-34a inhibitor transfection, the expression of miR-34a decreased significantly (p \u003c 0.05). The viability of cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cells increased significantly (p \u003c 0.05) with significant decrease of apoptosis after miR-34a expression inhibition, as demonstrated by MTT and flow cytometry with miR-34a over-expression, the viability of cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cells decreased significantly (p \u003c 0.05), with significant apoptosis increase (p \u003c 0.05). As shown by Western blot and flow cytometry, in comparison to the control group, Wortmannin could inhibit miR-34a inhibitor and DDP induced up-regulation of p-AKT significantly (p \u003c 0.05) and stimulated apoptosis. In conclusion, miR-34a expression was down-regulated in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. miR-34a over-expression could improve the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells against cisplatin-based chemotherapies, with PI3K/AKT/survivin signaling pathway possibly involved in the mechanism.","title":"miR-34a regulates cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cell death by modulating PI3K/AKT/survivin pathway.","pubmedId":"24068565"}
