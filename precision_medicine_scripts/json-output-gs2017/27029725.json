This concerned all the biological medical technics, including molecular biology technics. In this work, we described the validation steps by real time quantitative PCR of L858R mutation in EGFR gene, frequently detected in non-small lung cancers (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor - tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are authorized in Europe for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC after failure of, at least one, prior chemotherapy. Thus, in view of accreditation of this analysis, we have used the recommendation of the COFRAC (Comité français d\u0027accréditation) and INCa (Institut national du cancer). Several parameters have been tested, such as the primers, the limit of detection, and the sensitivity and specificity of the method. In addition, a risk study has been evaluated. Although long and fastidious, the method of validation is required to perform analysis in optimal conditions to guaranty optimal results for the patients.
