Primary malignant soft-tissue sarcoma of the chest is a rare entity. Most of them are low grade, and complete surgical excision is the preferred therapeutic choice. Like most cancers, the incidence of liposarcoma increases with advancing age, and subtotal resection is considered a palliative surgical procedure. The benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for these tumors remains controversial.","title":"Giant ulcerated pleomorphic liposarcoma of the chest wall.","pubmedId":"18090587"}
