Subsequent workup revealed carcinoma of the prostate metastatic to the uvea. On ophthalmologic evaluation, choroidal metastasis was noted. His prostate was firm on digital rectal examination, and the serum prostate-specific antigen level was 124 ng/mL. Prostate biopsy was consistent with adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 9. The patient was treated with total androgen blockade and radiation to the eye. Although his ocular lesions disappeared, the patient died of hormone-refractory disease 32 months after the diagnosis. The first case of prostate cancer metastatic to the uvea was reported more than 1 century ago; however, only a few cases have been reported subsequently. To our knowledge, we present the first published report in the urological literature of a patient in whom ocular complaints were the presenting symptoms that led to the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The urologist should be cognizant of the distinct possibility of ocular metastasis if a patient with prostate cancer presents with complaints related to the eye.","title":"Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate to the uvea as the initial presenting symptom in a 49-year-old man.","pubmedId":"11445497"}
