Activating mutations in the EGFR confer hypersensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Erlotinib has been developed in EGFR mutation-positive patients as a firstline treatment, and results from recently completed phase III studies have shown superior progression-free survival and response rates for erlotinib, compared to chemotherapy.","title":"[Erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"21677478"}
