EML4-ALK is most often detected in never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma and has unique pathologic features. EML4-ALK fusion gene is oncogenic, which could be suppressed by ALK-inhibitor through blocking the downstream signaling passway of EML4-ALK. This review will focus on the molecular structure, function, biology, detection method and the diagnostic and therapeutic meaning of EML4-ALK of lung cancer.","title":"[A new target in non-small cell lung cancer: EML4-ALK fusion gene].","pubmedId":"21645460"}
