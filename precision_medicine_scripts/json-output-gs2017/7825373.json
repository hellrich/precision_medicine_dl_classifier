From a total of 1190 inhabitants \u003e or \u003d 65 years living in two Bavarian villages near Munich, 982 could be visited at home (\"door-to-door\" survey), where a questionnaire and the measurement section were performed (response rate 82.5%). Blood pressure was measured three times in the sitting position with a standard sphygmomanometer, (\"actual\") hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure \u003e or \u003d 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure \u003e or \u003d 95 mm Hg or effective antihypertensive treatment. Obesity was defined as body mass index \u003e or \u003d 27.8 kg/m2 for men or \u003e or \u003d 27.3 kg/m2 for women, hypercholesterolemia as total cholesterol \u003e or \u003d 250 mg/dl (6.5 mmol/l), diabetes as fasting serum glucose \u003e 120 mg/dl, glucosuria or treatment with insulin or oral antidiabetics. With a prevalence of 53% hypertension was the leading risk factor, followed by obesity with 35% and hypercholesterolemia with 21%; smoking and diabetes were observed in \u003c 10%. Hypertension and obesity tended to be more prevalent in women, diabetes in men; hypercholesterolemia was significantly more prevalent in women. While the prevalence of hypertension increased up to the age groups \"75-79 years\" in men and \"80-84 years\" in women, there was a constant decrease with age for obesity, hypercholesterolemia and smoking. Three-quarters of the participants showed a minimum of one cardiovascular risk factor, the risk factor combination \"hypertension/hypercholesterolemia/smoking\" was observed however only in 1%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"[Cardiovascular risk factors in patients over 65-years of age in Germany.
