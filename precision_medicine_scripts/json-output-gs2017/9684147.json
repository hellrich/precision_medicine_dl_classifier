From 1988 to 1996 we performed partial duodeno-pancreatectomies (Whipple procedure) combined with either regional (n \u003d 20, group A) or extended retroperitoneal (n \u003d 33, group B) lymphadenectomy in 53 patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas head.\nThe outcome of the two groups was compared by constructing survival curves and evaluating demographic, intraoperative and histopathologic data from all patients (n \u003d 44) with curative (R0) resections.\nFor patients after R0 resection there was no significant difference in terms of survival between group A and B. Only tumor stage (p \u003d 0.0258), portal vein invasion (p \u003d 0.0190) and tumor grade (p \u003d 0.0021) had a significant influence on survival, regardless of the type of operation.\nOur data suggest that no further improvement of the survival rate can be achieved by extended retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy, compared to regional lymphadenectomy.","title":"Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas head: survival after regional versus extended lymphadenectomy.","pubmedId":"9684147"}
