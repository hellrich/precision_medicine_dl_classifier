Twelve of 14 RSs had corresponding EUS-FNAs with cell blocks (CBs). Non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue, including chronic pancreatitis, was evaluated in all RSs. Immunohistochemical stains for S100P and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) were performed on tissue and CB sections. Staining intensity (0 no staining; 1+ weak; 2+ moderate; 3+ strong) and proportion of positive cells (less than 10% negative; 1+ 10-25%; 2+ 26-75%; 3+ greater than 75%) were assessed. Positive staining was defined as â‰¥10% cells with at least 1+ intensity.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of S100P and XIAP immunoreactivity for a diagnosis of PDA in RSs were both 100%. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity in EUS-FNA CBs of S100P were 78.2 and 87.5% and of XIAP 82.6 and 50.0%, respectively. The combined sensitivity of S100P and XIAP was 100% in 12 RSs and 83.3% in the corresponding EUS-FNA CBs.\nTwo novel biomarkers have very high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of PDA in RSs. S100P has slightly lower sensitivity and higher specificity of PDA than XIAP in EUS-FNA specimens. We recommend using both biomarkers as cytological diagnostic adjuncts, especially in difficult cases of well-differentiated PDA versus reactive ductal epithelium.","title":"S100P and XIAP expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: potential novel biomarkers as a diagnostic adjunct to fine needle aspiration cytology.","pubmedId":"21325798"}
