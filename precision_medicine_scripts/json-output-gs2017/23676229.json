Sections through the laser sites were stained for light and transmission electron microscopy. The percentage of the laser sites with rupture of the retinal vein and Bruch\u0027s membrane, the degree of tissue damage, and the diameter of the rupture in Bruch\u0027s membrane were determined.\nThe rate of vein rupture was 75% at 3 W, and rupture of Bruch\u0027s membrane was achieved at all powers tested. The mean diameter of the rupture in Bruch\u0027s membrane increased with laser power.\nThe Integre Duo laser system (Ellex Medical Lasers, Adelaide, Australia) is capable of rupturing the retinal vein and Bruch\u0027s membrane at lower powers than prior laser systems.","title":"Evaluation of the ability of a photocoagulator to rupture the retinal vein and Bruch\u0027s membrane for potential vein bypass in retinal vein occlusion.","pubmedId":"23676229"}
