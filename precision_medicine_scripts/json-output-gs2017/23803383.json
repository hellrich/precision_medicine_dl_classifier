The number of cells was measured by the MTT method, and the cell cycle regulatory proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting.\nEight human pancreatic cancer cell lines expressed vitamin D receptor (VDR) mRNA. 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibited proliferation of SUIT-2 and its sublines. We found p21 to be upregulated after 24 hours in S2-028, the cell line in which proliferation was most inhibited by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.\n1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibited proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells and is involved in the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21.","title":"Antiproliferative effect of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 involves upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in human pancreatic cancer cells.","pubmedId":"23803383"}
