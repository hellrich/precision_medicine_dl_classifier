The IDH1-R132H mutation predicts a better clinical outcome for glioma patients, and the expression of IDH1-R132H correlates with a favorable outcome in patients with brain tumors. Here, we investigated IDH1-R132H expression in both gastric (n\u003d526) and colorectal (n\u003d399) tissues by performing immunohistochemistry analyses on tissue microarrays. We also tested whether IDH1-R132H expression correlated with various clinical parameters. In both gastric and colorectal cancer, expression of IDH1-R132H was associated with tumor stage. Patients with low IDH1-R132H expression had a poor overall survival. Our data indicate that IDH1-R132H expression could be used as a predictive marker of prognosis for patients with gastrointestinal cancer.","title":"Decreased expression of IDH1-R132H correlates with poor survival in gastrointestinal cancer.","pubmedId":"27655638"}
