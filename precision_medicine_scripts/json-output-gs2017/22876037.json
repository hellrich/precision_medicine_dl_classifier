Methylation of miR-373 was investigated using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, and recruitment of methyl binding proteins was studied using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Mutation analysis was conducted using the QuikChangeâ„¢ Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit. The activity of miR-373 gene promoter constructs and targeting at MBD2-three prime untranslated region (3\u0027UTR) by miR-373 were evaluated by a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay.\nIn hilar cholangiocarcinoma, miR-373 decreased and was closely associated with poor cell differentiation, advanced clinical stage, and shorter survival. The promoter-associated CpG island of miR-373 gene was hypermethylated and inhibited expression of miR-373. MBD2 was up-regulated and enriched at the promoter-associated CpG island of miR-373. Methylation-mediated suppression of miR-373 required MBD2 enrichment at the promoter-associated CpG island, and miR-373 negatively regulated MBD2 expression through targeting the 3\u0027UTR.\nMiR-373 behaves as a direct transcriptional target and negative regulator of MBD2 activity through a feedback loop of CpG island methylation.","title":"Mutual regulation between microRNA-373 and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 in hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22876037"}
