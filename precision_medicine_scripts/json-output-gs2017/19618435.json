Mutations in the NTRK1 gene are associated with the pathogenesis of CIPA. In this study, we performed a clinical and genetic analysis on the NTRK1 gene in four Korean patients with CIPA. All patients had typical clinical manifestations of CIPA, including anhidrosis, recurrent fever, absent pain perception, and developmental delay. Sequencing analysis revealed one predominant mutation, c.851-33T\u003eA, in four affected alleles and three novel mutations, including c.287+2dupT, c.2155G\u003eA (p.Glu719Lys), and c.1218delC (p.Pro407ArgfsX), in each affected allele. For one patient, who was heterozygous for c.851-33T\u003eA, another mutation could not be identified, suggesting that a possible hidden intronic or large genomic mutation may have been present. This study extends the spectrum of mutations in the NTRK1 gene and confirms that Korean patients with CIPA have the same genetic background as other ethnicities.","title":"Clinical and genetic analysis of Korean patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.","pubmedId":"19618435"}
