Considering the difficulty of curative resection, we first performed an ileostomy. Remarkable tumor regression was indicated by computed tomography(CT)and colonoscopy after 3 courses of mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab. A sigmoidectomy and partial cystectomy were performed with a curative intent. Six courses of XELOX adjuvant chemotherapy were administered, and no recurrence has been observed for 9 months. mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab might be an effective preoperative chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced KRAS wild-type colon cancer.
