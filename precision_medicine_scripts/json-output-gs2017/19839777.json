We aimed to determine the distribution of mutations in the two genes depending on patient clinocopathological characteristics. We sequenced exon 1 of the KRAS gene and exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene in 108 consecutive EC tumor samples. PIK3CA mutations were present in 24 of the 108 (22.2%) cases and KRAS mutations in 18 of the 108 (16.7%) cases. PIK3CA mutations occurred more frequently in KRAS-mutated samples (7/18, 38.9%; p \u003d 0.06) than in KRAS wild type (17/90, 18.9%) and showed a very high frequency in metastatic tumors (4/9, 44.4%; p \u003d 0.1) and in samples displaying serous differentiation-serous and mixed endometrioid/serous tumors (6/12, 50.0%; p \u003d 0.021)-where KRAS mutations were rare (11.1% and 16.7%, respectively) and did not exist independently of a PIK3CA mutation. Non-hotspot (i.e., non-E542K, -E545K, and -H1047R) mutations in the PIK3CA gene showed higher frequency in metastatic cases (3/9, 33.3%; p \u003d 0.05). Tumors displaying serous differentiation showed a particular pattern-they harbored exclusively mutations in PIK3CA exon 20 (5/12, 41.7%; p \u003d 0.005) and most of these were non-hotspot (4/12, 33.3%; p \u003d 0.02). In all other comparisons exons 9 and 20 mutation distribution did not differ. These results suggest the need for further exploration of the significance of PIK3CA mutations in respect to aggressive EC.","title":"Rare mutations in the PIK3CA gene contribute to aggressive endometrial cancer.","pubmedId":"19839777"}
