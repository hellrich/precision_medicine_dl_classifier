Therefore, identification of at-risk populations may allow early detection of disease at a curable stage. In Europe and North America, between 8-14% of melanoma patients have a family history of the disease, and a subset of these individuals possess germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene, which encodes the p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) tumor suppressors. We identified 30 patients (29 families) from Southern Brazil, who had a family history of melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer; or a personal history of multiple primary melanoma. We screened this cohort for mutations in the CDKN2A and CDK4 genes, and detected two functional mutations: a G-34T transversion in 5\u0027untranslated region; and a M53I alteration encoded in exon 2. Both mutants have been previously associated with melanoma and demonstrate founder effects. We conclude that germline mutations of CDKN2A occur in the Brazilian population, and that these mutations likely originated in Europe.","title":"Clinical and molecular characterization of patients at risk for hereditary melanoma in southern Brazil.","pubmedId":"17713569"}
