However, there is no approved targeted therapy for lung SCC. LCGI aims to identify potential targets in lung SCC.  Methods:  The LCGI study is being carried out in patients with surgically resected lung SCC. We used the platform of Sequenoms MassArray to perform genotyping for 548 somatic hotspot mutations in 49 genes including genes in the MAPK and PI3K pathways. We also evaluated FGFR1 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and MET protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results:  Lung SCCs from 201 patients have been tested by Sequenom MassArray to date. Lung SCCs from 150 patients have been evaluated for MET protein expression and 89 for FGFR1 amplification. 134 (66.7%) patients were male. The median age of the cohort was 68. The majority of patients were either current (32.8%) or former (64.2%) smokers at the time of diagnosis. 104 (57.1%) were stage I, 68 (33.8%) were stage II, 29 (14.5%) were stage III SCCs. At least one aberrant, potentially targetable oncogene was identified in the SCC of 81 (40.3%) patients (see Table). The presence of PIK3CA or KRAS mutations, or FGFR1 amplification did not have a statistically significant impact on median overall survival or recurrence-free survival. However, the presence of two or more aberrations in driver oncogenes in a tumor (patients, n \u003d 19) was associated with a worse median overall survival compared to patients with either a single driver aberration (p \u003d 0.04) or no aberrations (p \u003c .001).  Conclusions:  40.3% of lung SCC patients have an aberrant, potentially targetable driver oncogene in their tumor. The presence of two or more aberrant oncogenes is a poor prognostic factor. These findings can be used to guide clinical trials in lung SCC.
