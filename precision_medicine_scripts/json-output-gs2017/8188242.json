Molecular studies indicate that genes within chromosomal band 22q12 may be involved in tumorigenesis. We have mapped 29 loci into 16 groups in this region, using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, fluorescence in situ suppression hybridization, and somatic cell hybrid mapping. The region spans more than 5 Mb of genomic DNA and contains the genes for neurofibromatosis type 2 and meningioma. The order of loci presented here provides the framework for the fine mapping of this region using cosmids and yeast artificial chromosomes, and it facilitates the speedy cloning of novel genes from 22q12.","title":"Physical mapping of the NF2/meningioma region on human chromosome 22q12.","pubmedId":"8188242"}
