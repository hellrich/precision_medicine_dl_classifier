We investigated 49 PXAs for clinical, histological and immunohistochemical characteristics related to BRAF mutation status. BRAF mutation was detected by immunohistochemical assay and DNA sequencing in 38/49 (78%) tumors. All but one PXA located in the temporal lobe harbored a BRAF V600E mutation (23/24; 96%) compared with 10/19 nontemporal PXAs (53%; P \u003d 0.0009). Histological and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased reticulin deposition (76% vs. 27%; P \u003d 0.003) and a more frequent expression of CD34 in BRAF-mutant PXAs (76% vs. 27%; P \u003d 0.003). We further investigated the utility of combined BRAF V600E (VE1) and p16 analysis by immunohistochemistry to distinguish PXAs from relevant histological mimics like giant-cell glioblastoma. Among PXAs, 38/49 (78%) were VE1-positive, and 30/49 (61%) had a loss of p16 expression. The combined features (VE1 positivity/p16 loss) were observed in 25/49 PXAs (51%) but were not observed in giant-cell glioblastoma (VE1 0/28, p16 loss 14/28). We demonstrate that temporal location, reticulin deposition and CD34 expression are associated with BRAF mutation in PXA. Combined VE1 positivity and p16 loss represents a frequent immunoprofile of PXA and may therefore constitute an additional diagnostic tool for its differential diagnosis.
