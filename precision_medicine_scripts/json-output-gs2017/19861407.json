We have recently reported that downregulation of erbB3 abrogates erbB2-mediated tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that erbB3 may play a major role connecting these two sentinel pathways. Interactions were studied using mammary/breast cancer cell lines from wild-type rat c-neu gene transgenic mice and humans. Estradiol promoted cell proliferation and activated erbB2/neu tyrosine kinase, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling exclusively in mammary and breast epithelial cell lines with coexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3. Estradiol action was independent of the transgene promoter (MMTV-LTR) activity, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as c-neu transgene or endogenous erbB2 gene expression. Estrogen induction of cell growth promotion, erbB2/neu activation, and downstream signaling was abrogated by blockade of estrogen receptor (ER) with the pure ER antagonist ICI 182,780 or knockdown of erbB3 expression via specific siRNA. These data suggest that activation of both ER and erbB2/erbB3 signaling is requisite for estrogen-induced mitogenesis and erbB2/neu tyrosine kinase activation.","title":"Estrogenic promotion of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activity in mammary tumor cells requires activation of ErbB3 signaling.","pubmedId":"19861407"}
