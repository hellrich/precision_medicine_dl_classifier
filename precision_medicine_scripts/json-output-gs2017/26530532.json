We evaluated the expression of GRP78 using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry in tumor tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues from 180 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. The associations between the expression levels of GRP78, clinicopathological factors, and overall survival were evaluated. The results showed that the expression of GRP78 was significantly higher in PDAC cells than in normal pancreatic duct cells within adjacent nontumor tissues (p \u003c 0.05). The increased expression of GRP78 in the tumor tissues was significantly correlated with a higher T-stage (p \u003c 0.05) and a shorter overall survival (OS, p \u003c 0.05). In an in vitro study, the regulation of GRP78 in the PDAC cell lines affected the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PDAC cells through the regulation of CyclinD1, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK6, phospho-signal transducer, activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3), janus kinase 2 (JAK2), ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA), Rho-associated kinase 1 (ROCK1), and sterile alpha motif domain containing protein 4 (Smad4). The present data suggest that GRP78 plays a crucial role in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells and may be a suitable prognostic marker in PDAC.
