Logistic regression analyses were performed to test the relationship between average weekly work hours, and the reported prevalence of those conditions for each individual.\nRegularly working long hours over 32 years was significantly associated with elevated risks of heart disease, non-skin cancer, arthritis, and diabetes. The observed risk was much larger among women than among men.\nWorking long-hour schedules over many years increases the risk for some specific chronic diseases, especially for women.","title":"Chronic Disease Risks From Exposure to Long-Hour Work Schedules Over a 32-Year Period.","pubmedId":"27305843"}
