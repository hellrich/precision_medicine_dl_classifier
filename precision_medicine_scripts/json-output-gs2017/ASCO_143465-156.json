However, despite initial response most patients (p) will eventually relapse and monitoring EML4-ALK rearrangements over the course of treatment may help identify them. Challenges associated with serial tumor biopsies have highlighted the need for blood-based assays for monitoring biomarkers. Platelets can sequester RNA released by tumor cells and are an attractive source for non-invasive biomarker assessment.  Methods:  EML4-ALK rearrangements were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in platelets and plasma isolated from blood obtained from 77 NSCLC p, 38 of whom had EML4-ALK-rearranged tumors. In a subset of 29 p with EML4-ALK-rearranged tumors treated with crizotinib, EML4-ALK rearrangements in platelets were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:  The study was designed with three parallel objectives: firstly to determine the sensitivity and specificity of detecting EML4-ALK rearrangements in platelets with plasma serving as a control biosource; secondly, to examine the potential impact of EML4-ALK rearrangement in platelets on outcome to crizotinib; thirdly, to test the feasibility of monitoring a p throughout treatment with EML4-ALK rearrangement assessment in platelets. RT-PCR demonstrated 65% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detection of EML4-ALK rearrangements in platelets. In the subset of 29 p treated with crizotinib, PFS was 3.7 months for p with EML4-ALK+ platelets and 16 months for those with EML4-ALK platelets (hazard ratio, 3.5; P \u003d 0.02). Monitoring EML4-ALK rearrangements in platelets of one index p over a period of 30 months revealed crizotinib resistance two months prior to radiographic disease progression.  Conclusions:  Platelets may provide a useful source for non-invasive assessment of EML4-ALK rearrangements and may prove useful for predicting outcome to crizotinib. Serial analyses of EML4-ALK rearrangements in platelets may help improve clinical decisions based on radiographic imaging alone by detecting resistance to therapy sooner.","title":"EML4-ALK rearrangement in blood platelets and outcome to crizotinib in non-small-cell lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_143465-156"}
