The two cases indicate two different etiologies for intratumoral calcification in ductal adenocarcinoma. Thus, the possibility of adenocarcinoma should be considered when a tumor with intratumoral calcification is found, although the incidence of intratumoral calcification in the ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas remains rare.","title":"Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with intratumoral calcification.","pubmedId":"10525818"}
