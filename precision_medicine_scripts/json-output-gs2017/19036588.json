However, AIs should not be used in premenopausal women because they can paradoxically increase estrogen secretion and may therefore stimulate tumor progression. In perimenopausal women undergoing treatment for breast cancer, it can be difficult to determine true menopausal status because adjuvant chemotherapy, tamoxifen, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues can induce transient (or permanent) ovarian suppression. How can one determine whether these women are truly postmenopausal and therefore candidates for AI therapy? A panel of experts in the field of endocrine therapy in breast cancer met in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on October 23, 2006, to discuss this clinical dilemma. This report summarizes the conclusions and recommendations that arose from this discussion.","title":"Adjuvant endocrine therapy for perimenopausal women with early breast cancer.","pubmedId":"19036588"}
