Here, we report the identification of five novel immunogenic antigens expressed in meningioma. An expression library was generated from a meningioma that retained both copies of chromosome 22. Screening with autologous patient serum identified seven cDNA clones that were indicated by antigen-antibody complexes. The clones were sequenced, and sequence comparison revealed that the seven clones represent five different genes, providing evidence that meningiomas express a spectrum of immunoreactive antigens, which were termed meningioma expressed antigens (MGEAs). One gene was identical with the connective tissue growth factor, one gene was in part homologous to an Alzheimer disease-associated gene, and a third gene was in part identical to Homo sapiens molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis proteins A and C mRNA. One gene was partially homologous to previously reported cDNA sequences of unknown function, and the fifth gene showed no significant homologies to sequences deposited in databases. Using somatic hybrid mapping, three genes were localized on chromosome 6, and two genes were localized on chromosomes 3 and 17, respectively. To distinguish the MGEAs from the so-called natural autoantigenes, we also screened the library with 12 sera from individuals without obvious disease. The clones identified by reactivity with normal sera were completely different from the clones identified by screening the same meningioma expression library with serum from the patient bearing the tumor. These data suggest that the newly identified MGEA genes may be useful for diagnosis and possibly therapy of meningioma.","title":"Five novel immunogenic antigens in meningioma: cloning, expression analysis, and chromosomal mapping.","pubmedId":"10589772"}
