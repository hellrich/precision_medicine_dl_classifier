Preoperative imatinib may decrease surgical morbidity, increase resection rate, and even preserve organ function through down-staging of the tumor. For advanced GIST, the choice of treatment is targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Although surgical intervention showed certain efficacy in several retrospective analyses, the role of surgery for advanced disease still needs to be proven by prospective controlled trials. Better combination of targeted therapy and surgery has become critical in multidisciplinary therapy for GIST.","title":"[Strategy for better combination of targeted therapy and surgery in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor].","pubmedId":"22454157"}
