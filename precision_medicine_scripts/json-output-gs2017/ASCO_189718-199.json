Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) constitute 60-70% of NSCLC incidence in Russia, however physicians are often discouraged to send NSCLC-SCC for EGFR testing due to low frequency of mutations. Methods: We considered all NSCLC patients analyzed by means of PCR for the presence of EGFR mutations (ex19del and L858R) within years 2012-2017. Results: 21,039 NSCLC patients were tested. EGFR analysis was successful in 20,768 patients (98.7%). EGFR mutations were detected in 3566/17717 (20.1%) adenocarcinomas (AdCa) of the lung (ex19del: 2203 (12.4%); L858R: 1363 (7.7%)). There was an evident age-related increase in the frequency of L858R substitution in AdCa patients (p \u003d0.000, Table). This set of patients included 1,139 NSCLC-SCC cases, and the EGFR mutation was observed in 41 (3.6%) subjects. Among 189 females with NSCLC-SCC, ex19del or L858R were detected in 25 (13.2%) cases. Stratification by smoking status revealed EGFR mutation in 19/242 (7.9%) non-smokers. Conclusions: Elderly NSCLC patients have particularly increased probability to be diagnosed with L858R mutation. In the real-world setting, patients with NSCLC-SCC may have high frequency of EGFR mutations, either due to imprecise histological subtyping or due to yet unknown reasons. All female and non-smoking patients with NSCLC have to undergo EGFR testing irrespectively of tumor histology.
