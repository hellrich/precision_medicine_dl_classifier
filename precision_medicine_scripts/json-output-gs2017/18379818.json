A malignant transformation of cystic neoplasia is observed in intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMN) lesions in 60% and in mucinous cystic tumor (MCN) lesions in up to 30%. For cystic neoplasia located monocentrically in the pancreatic head and that do not have an association with an invasive pancreatic cancer, the duodenum-preserving total head resection has been used in recent time as a limited surgical procedure.\nAn indication to duodenum-preserving total pancreatic head resection is considered for patients who do not have clinical signs of an advanced cancer in the lesion and who have main-duct IPMN and monocentric MCN lesions. In 104 patients with cystic neoplastic lesions in the Ulm series, 32% finally had a carcinoma in situ or an advanced pancreatic cancer. The application of a duodenum-preserving total pancreatic head resection in patients with asymptomatic cystic lesion is based on the size of the tumor and the tumor relation to the pancreatic ducts. For patients who have preoperatively clinical signs of malignancy, a Kausch-Whipple type of oncologic resection is recommended.\nDuodenum-preserving total pancreatic head resection is used in several modifications. The surgical procedure is a limited pancreatic head resection which necessitates segmental resection of the peripapillary duodenum. Hospital mortality is very low; in most published series it is 0%. The long-term outcome is determined by completeness of resection for both -- benign and malignant -- entities. Careful evaluation of the frozen section results has a pivotal role for intraoperative decision making.\nA duodenum-preserving total pancreatic head resection is a limited surgical procedure for patients who suffer a local monocentric, cystic neoplastic lesion in the pancreatic head. Absence of an advanced pancreatic cancer and completeness of extirpation of the benign tumor determine the long-term outcome. In regards to the location of the lesion in the pancreatic head, several modifications have been applied with low hospital morbidity and mortality below 1%.","title":"Duodenum-preserving total pancreatic head resection for cystic neoplasm: a limited but cancer-preventive procedure.","pubmedId":"18379818"}
