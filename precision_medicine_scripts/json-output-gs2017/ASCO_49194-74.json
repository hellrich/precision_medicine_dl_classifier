Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) incidence has decreased during the last years and gender differences have been reported. Methods: WORLD07 is a prospective, multicenter, epidemiologic female-specific lung cancer database analyzing characteristics and treatments of women with lung cancer from several Spanish cancer centers. Inclusion criteria: women \u003e 18 years with a diagnosis of lung cancer, regardless of being treated or not. Written informed consent was required. Results: From October 2007 to December 2009, 629 female newly diagnosed of lung cancer were included in an e-database at 36 Spanish centers. Of those, 68 (10.8%) presented with SCLC. Characteristics were the following: Median age 60 years (y) (range: 39-82); Caucasian 98.5%; marital status (%): married 54.5, unmarried 13, divorced 15, widow 16; educational level (%): basic 44, secondary 22, university 13; median age of menarche: 13 y; children: 74% (median: 2); median age of first child: 25.5 y; premenopausal 13%, postmenopausal 84%; median age of menopause: 47 y; oral contraceptive: 37%; smoking habit (%): never 13, former smoker 16, current smoker 71; family history of cancer: 47%; previous history of cancer: 15%. stage of disease: limited: 51%, extensive: 49%. Conclusions: The incidence of SCLC among women is similar to what is described in the general lung cancer population. Our results indicate that the percentage of never smokers and limited disease is slightly higher in that subgroup.","title":"Small cell lung cancer in women: The Spanish female-specific database WORLD07.","pubmedId":"ASCO_49194-74"}
