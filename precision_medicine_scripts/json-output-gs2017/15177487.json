These reagents have the advantage of exquiste specificity, and as currently engineered, low toxicity. The impact monoclonal antibody therapy has recently been demonstrated in colorectal cancer, in which two pathways critical to carcinogenesis have been targeted. The targets are the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway and angiogenesis. Antibodies directed to proteins in both pathways have shown significant activity especially in combination with chemotherapy, and studies in the adjuvant setting are in progress. We review the use of monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of colorectal cancer with particular attention to edrecolomab (Mab 17-1A), bevacizumab (Avastin), cetuximab (IMC-C225), ABX-EGF and EMD 72000. Additional compounds are in earlier stages of development, and the future of this approach in solid tumours is promising.","title":"Monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"15177487"}
