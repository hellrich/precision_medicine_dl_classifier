Of the variables evaluated, lupus anticoagulant had the strongest association with a history of thrombosis. Both positive anticardiolipin antibody concentrations and the presence of (mild) thrombocytopenia were significantly associated with a history of thrombosis and the presence of lupus anticoagulant. Reduced concentrations of antithrombin III, plasminogen, (free) protein S, and protein C were found in some patients but were not associated with either thrombosis or lupus anticoagulant. Mean concentrations of total protein S were significantly lower in patients with thrombosis than in those without and in patients with lupus anticoagulant than in those without. The antigenic concentration of prothrombin was reduced in 3/74 (4%) lupus patients. These three patients had lupus anticoagulant but no history of thrombosis, which suggests that a low prothrombin concentration protects patients with lupus anticoagulant from the development of thrombosis. A prolonged bleeding time was associated with the presence of lupus anticoagulant but not with a history of thrombosis. Analysis by stepwise logistic regression did not disclose additional risk factors for thrombosis in lupus patients with lupus anticoagulant. Increased antithrombin III concentrations and decreased free protein S concentrations are often found in lupus patients, unrelated to lupus anticoagulant or thrombosis.","title":"Risk factors for thrombosis in lupus patients.","pubmedId":"2512863"}
