As data on BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcript status remain mainly limited to children, we aimed to examine the diagnostic value of BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcripts across all age groups.\nBRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcript status was examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of 105 primary pilocytic astrocytomas [median patient age: 17 years (1-74 years)].\nInformative results (distinct wildtype BRAF bands detectable) were obtained in 105/124 cases (85%). Fusion transcripts were detected in 53 of cases (51%). They were more often encountered in tumours of infratentorial location [42/67 (63%) vs. 11/38 (29%)] and comprised KIAA1549-Ex16_BRAF-Ex9 (32 cases), KIAA1549-Ex15_BRAF-Ex9 (14 cases) and KIAA1549-Ex16_BRAF-Ex11 (seven cases). Fusion transcripts were present in 79% of tumours diagnosed in the first decade of life, but only in 51% of patients aged 11-20 years, 42% of patients aged 21-30 years, 30% of patients aged 31-40 years and 7% of patients older than 40 years. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the association of fusion transcript status and age was confirmed adjusting for tumour location (P \u003d 0.006).\nThe frequency of BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcripts is significantly lower in adult patients with pilocytic astrocytoma, weakening the sensitivity of this specific diagnostic marker in that age group.","title":"BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcripts are less frequent in pilocytic astrocytomas diagnosed in adults.","pubmedId":"21696415"}
