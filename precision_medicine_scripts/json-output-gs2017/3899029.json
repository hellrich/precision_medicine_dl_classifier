Patients were randomized following surgery and careful intraoperative staging to receive either chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of CisPlatinum, Adriamycin, and Cytoxan and immunotherapy consisted of Levamisole and Intrapleural BCG. Sixty-eight patients were randomized to the immunotherapy arm and 62 to the chemotherapy arm. There were 49 recurrences in the immunotherapy group and 35 in the chemotherapy group (p \u003d 0.003). These studies indicate that surgical adjuvant chemotherapy is effective in prolonging the disease-free survival in patients with Stages II and III adenocarcinoma and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Patients with Stages II and III resected squamous cell carcinoma were randomized to receive postoperative radiation therapy or no further treatment. One hundred and ninety patients were randomized into this study. There was no significant difference in terms of survival between the two treatment groups. However, those who received radiation therapy had a significantly lower incidence of local recurrence (p \u003d 0.001). These studies indicate that postoperative radiation therapy is effective in controlling the local disease but that effective systemic therapy is necessary for improved survival in patients with Stages II and III squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.","title":"A randomized comparison of the effects of adjuvant therapy on resected stages II and III non-small cell carcinoma of the lung.
