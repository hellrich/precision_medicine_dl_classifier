However, EGFR and KRAS gene mutations in lung squamous cell carcinoma are rarely reported. The aim of this study was to analyze EGFR and KRAS gene mutation rate and their relationship with clinical features in patients with lung squamous cell carcinomas.\nA total of 139 patients undergoing treatment for naïve lung squamous cell carcinomas with tumor tissue samples available for testing were recruited. EGFR and KRAS mutation statuses of the tumor samples were detected using a mutant enriched liquid chip.\nOf the 139 cases of lung squamous cell carcinoma, EGFR mutations were detected in 25 cases (18%), KRAS mutations were detected in 7 cases (5%), and the presence of both EGFR and KRAS mutations was detected in 1 case (0.7%). EGFR mutations occurred more often in females than in males (33.3% vs 16.5%) and in patients that never smoked than in those who smoke (29.6% vs 16.1%). However, the difference did not reach statistical significance (P\u003e0.05). No significant differences were observed in age, stage, and different biopsy type. KRAS mutations occurred more often in males than in females (5.5% vs 0%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P\u003e0.05). No significant differences were observed in age, stage, different biopsy type, and smoking status (P\u003e0.05).\nEGFR and KRAS mutations were low in lung squamous cell carcinomas, and had no significant correlation with clinical features. Before using tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeted therapy, EGFR and KRAS mutations should be detected in patients with lung squamous cell carcinomas.\n背景与目的 表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）突变和KRAS基因突变是非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）靶向治疗的重要分子标志，但关于肺鳞癌中EGFR和KRAS基因突变情况的报道甚少。本研究旨在分析肺鳞癌EGFR和KRAS基因突变与临床特征的关系。方法 收集初治肺鳞癌患者139例，有可供检测的肿瘤组织标本。利用突变富集液相芯片法进行EGFR和KRAS基因突变检测。结果 139例肺鳞癌中，EGFR基因突变25例（18%），KRAS基因突变7例（5%），EGFR和KRAS基因同时发生突变1例（0.7%）。女性和不吸烟患者EGFR基因突变率高于男性和吸烟患者（33.3% vs 16.5%, 29.6% vs 16.1%），但差异均无统计学意义（P\u003e0.05, P\u003e0.05）；不同年龄、分期及病理取材标本之间差异均无统计学意义（P\u003e0.05）。男性患者KRAS基因突变率高于女性患者（5.5% vs 0%），但差异无统计学意义（P\u003e0.05）；在不同年龄、分期、病理取材标本及是否吸烟各亚组分析中KRAS基因突变差异无统计学意义（P\u003e0.05）。结论 肺鳞癌患者EGFR和KRAS基因突变发生率均较低，且都与临床特征无明显相关。肺鳞癌患者使用酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs）靶向治疗药物之前，也应检测EGFR基因和KRAS基因的突变情况。.","title":"[Detection and Analysis of EGFR and KRAS Mutations \u2029in the Patients with Lung Squamous Cell Carcinomas].","pubmedId":"26483334"}
