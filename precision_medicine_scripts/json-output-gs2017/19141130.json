Four categories of risk were outlined, from breast cancer \"average\" through \"very high\" risk, the latter including individuals with high penetrance BRCA1/2 gene mutations. Guidelines for management of patients in each of these categories were discussed, with the major portion of the conference being devoted to individuals with BRCA1/2 mutations. Prevalence of these mutations in the general populations was estimated to be 1 in 250-500 individuals, with an increased prevalence in Ashkenazic Jews and other founder groups. Risk reduction strategies for these individuals include surveillance, with or without chemoprevention drugs, or surgical procedures to remove the organs at risk, i.e., bilateral mastectomy and/or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. These risk reduction strategies were evaluated fully, and recommendations were made for the care of patients in each of the risk categories. These guidelines for patient care were approved by the entire group of experts.","title":"Proceedings of the international consensus conference on breast cancer risk, genetics, \u0026 risk management, April, 2007.","pubmedId":"19141130"}
