Data were collected prospectively. Postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) consisted of fluorouracil or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy; the median radiation dose was 45 Gy.\nThe 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 24.3% and 14.2%, respectively. Median OS was 14.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 12-16 months]. Patients with metastatic lymph nodes experienced improved median survival (16 vs 10 months; P \u003c 0.001) and 3-year OS (3-year OS 28% vs 8%) after adjuvant CRT compared with those who had no CRT. Patients who underwent non-curative resection had the same effect (median OS, 13 vs 8 months; P \u003d 0.037). Lymph node metastasis and non-curative resection showed no significance on multivariate analysis. Poor differentiation [risk ratio (RR) \u003d 2.10; P \u003c 0.001] and tumor size \u003e3 cm (RR \u003d 1.57; P \u003d 0.018) were found to be adverse prognostic factors; adjuvant CRT had borderline significance (RR \u003d 0.70; P \u003d 0.087).\nAdjuvant CRT benefited a subset of patients with resected PC, particularly those with lymph node metastasis and those undergoing non-curative resection. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients with tumors larger than 3 cm and poor differentiation had poor prognosis.","title":"Prognostic factors and adjuvant chemoradiation therapy after pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19582512"}
