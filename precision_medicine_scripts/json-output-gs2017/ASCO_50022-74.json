EGFR and KRAS mutations occur in mutually exclusive subsets of patients. The prognostic and predictive properties of EGFR mutations have been appreciated; however the prognostic relevance of KRAS mutations has not been established. We hypothesized that EGFR and KRAS mutations identified patients with distinct outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the association of EGFR and KRAS mutation status with survival after diagnosis in patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: With Institutional Review Board approval, we collected clinical information for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and known EGFR and KRAS mutation status evaluated at MSKCC between 2004 and 2009. Age, gender, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), smoking history, and survival from diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV disease were obtained. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methods. Results: A total of 1,081 patients were evaluable, including 638 women (59%) and 354 never smokers (33%). Patients had a median age of 65 (range 25-92) and 82% had a KPS  80%. Gender, KPS, smoking history, and age were univariately associated with OS in this population. In multivariate analysis, EGFR and KRAS mutations were independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: In this population of patients with stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma, those with KRAS mutations had a shorter survival than those patients with EGFR mutations or EGFR/KRAS wild-type tumors. This is the largest reported analysis of outcomes for patients with stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma including KRAS and EGFR mutation status.
