CST ALK IHC was scored using the scoring scheme of 0, no staining; 1+, faint; 2+, moderate; and 3+, strong cytoplasmic reactivity in â‰¥ 10% of tumor cells. As for Ventana IHC, a binary scoring system (positive or negative for ALK status) was adopted for evaluating the staining results.\nAmong 196 cases tested, 63 (32%), 65 (33%), 70 (36%), and 69 (35%) cases were ALK positive by FISH, Ventana IHC, CST IHC, and RT-PCR, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of Ventana IHC were 100% and 98%, respectively. Two Ventana IHC-positive cases, which were also CST IHC score of 3+, showed FISH negative, but their ALK rearrangement was confirmed by RT-PCR and direct sequencing. The sensitivity and specificity of CST IHC with staining intensity score of 1+ or more were 100% and 95%, respectively. Five (25%, of 20) patients with CST IHC score of 1+ were both FISH and RT-PCR negative. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR for detection of ALK fusion were 98% and 95%, respectively. The total accordance rate between ALK RT-PCR and Ventana IHC was 97%.\nThe novel fully automated IHC assay is a reliable screening tool in routine pathologic laboratories for identification of patients with ALK rearrangement for targeted therapy in lung ADC.","title":"Diagnostic value of a novel fully automated immunochemistry assay for detection of ALK rearrangement in primary lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23904459"}
