However, present diagnostic methods are unable to satisfy the individualized treatment requirements of patients with MPLC. The present study aimed to establish a quantitative mathematical model and analyze its diagnostic value for distinguishing between MPLC and cases of the histologically similar disease, intrapulmonary metastasis (IPM). The sum value of the differential expression ratios of four proteins, namely p53, p16, p27 and c-erbB2, was evaluated by immunohistochemically-staining specimens of primary cancers, second separate cancers, metastatic lymph nodes and metastatic cancers. The sum value of the differential expression ratio of the four proteins from the primary tumor and the lymph-node metastasis or metastatic cancer was \u003c90 in the 11 patients with a single metastatic cancer and in the 30 patients with lymph-node metastasis, but was \u003e90 in the 14 patients with different histological types of MPLC. Therefore, a quantitative differentially-expressed gene mathematical model was established as follows: Sum of the differential expression ratios \u003d p16T1 - T + p27T1 - T2 + C-erbB2T1 - T2 + p53T1 - T2, where T1 is the primary cancer and T2 is the lymph node metastasis, metastatic cancer or the second separate cancer. The quantitative differentially-expressed gene mathematical model is considered to be a useful tool for distinguishing between MPLC and IPM.","title":"A novel differential diagnostic model for multiple primary lung cancer: Differentially-expressed gene analysis of multiple primary lung cancer and intrapulmonary metastasis.","pubmedId":"25663860"}
