In our study, we investigated 149 meningiomas to determine whether there are additional tumor suppressor genes localized on chromosome 22q, apart from NF2, that might be involved in meningioma pathogenesis. The LOH analysis on chromosome 22q identified two regions of deletion: the first one, which is limited to the NF2 gene locus, and the second one, which is outside this location. The new minimal deletion region (MDR) included the following genes: BCR (breakpoint cluster region), RAB36 (a member of RAS oncogene family), GNAZ [guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), alpha-z polypeptide], and RTDR1 (rhabdoid tumor deletion region gene 1). The expression levels of all these genes, including NF2, were subsequently analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We observed a significantly lowered expression level of NF2 in meningiomas with 22q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within NF2 region compared to the one in meningiomas with 22q retention of heterozygosity (ROH, P\u003c0.05). Similarly, BCR showed a significantly lowered expression in meningiomas with 22q LOH within the new MDR compared to cases with 22q ROH (P\u003c0.05). Our data, together with the already published information considering BCR function suggest that BCR can be considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene localized on chromosome 22q which may be involved in meningioma pathogenesis.","title":"BCR expression is decreased in meningiomas showing loss of heterozygosity of 22q within a new minimal deletion region.","pubmedId":"18474292"}
