There are only 61 reports in the literature. The presenting complaint is usually a painless bulge in the inguinal or scrotal region. Our patient presented with a new-onset inguinoscrotal swelling that was misdiagnosed preoperatively as an incarcerated indirect hernia. The treatment for a spermatic cord liposarcoma is radical orchiectomy with high ligation of the cord. Radiation therapy is recommended in addition to surgery in situations with evidence of tumor with propensity for more aggressive behavior (i.e., high-grade tumor, lymphatic invasion, inadequate margin, or recurrence). The current literature, diagnosis, and management of malignant tumors of the spermatic cord are reviewed.","title":"Liposarcoma of the spermatic cord masquerading as an incarcerated inguinal hernia.","pubmedId":"12641360"}
