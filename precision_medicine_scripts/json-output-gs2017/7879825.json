The authors describe a case in which a patient came to their institution with dyspnea and a chest roentgenogram showing a prominent right pulmonary artery, right aortic arch, and a left lung mass accompanied by ipsilateral volume loss. Although the initial evaluation suggested a differential diagnosis that included thromboembolic pulmonary disease and vascular compression by tumor, further workup revealed unilateral absence of the left pulmonary artery accompanied by left lung hypoplasia, and interestingly, ipsilateral emphysema and adenocarcinoma. The embryologic factors responsible for this abnormality and how it may potentially affect the development of emphysema and adenocarcinoma are discussed.","title":"Case report: congenital absence of the left pulmonary artery accompanied by ipsilateral emphysema and adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"7879825"}
