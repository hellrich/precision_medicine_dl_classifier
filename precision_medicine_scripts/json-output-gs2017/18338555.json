Its abdominal localization is rare, occurring in only 5% of cases. A 55 year old male was found to have a case of primary giant liposarcoma of the mesenterium with a maximum diameter of 40 cm and weight of 9 kg. Computed tomography revealed the presence of a large mass presenting a dishomogeneous density with an adipose component, probably of mesenteric origin. A xifopubic laparotomy confirmed the presence of a pedunculated growth originating from the mesentery. The mass was removed and the histopathological report noted a well differentiated sclerosing liposarcoma with the peritoneal liquid positive for malignant cells. Surgery currently represents the only possibly curative therapy for this type of tumour but close long-term follow up and accurate evaluation of the clinicopathologic parameters are needed.","title":"Giant liposarcoma of the mesentery.
