Response rates were 97.1% in cases and 91.8% in controls.\nRisks of both subtypes in relation to phenotypic and environmental factors, estimated by multinomial logistic regression.\nThe number of solar lentigines was the strongest determinant for LMM (odds ratio [OR], 15.93; P \u003c .001 for trend) and significantly weaker for SSM (4.61; P \u003c .001 for trend; P \u003d .04 for homogeneity). Skin cancer history was significantly associated with LMM (OR, 2.84) but not with SSM (1.33; P \u003d .07 for homogeneity). In contrast, the number of nevi was the strongest determinant for SSM (OR, 23.22; P \u003c .001 for trend) while significantly weaker for LMM (3.60; P \u003d .02 for trend; P \u003c .001 for homogeneity). Multiple lifetime sunburns almost tripled the risk for SSM, whereas no association was detected with LMM (P \u003d .04 for homogeneity). Shared risk factors for both subtypes were the number of solar keratoses (P \u003c .001 for trend for both) and sun-sensitive complexion (ie, light eye/hair colors, sunburn propensity, and freckling) (2-fold to 5-fold increased risks).\nA propensity to lentigines is a stronger predictor of LMM, whereas high nevus propensity is a stronger predictor of SSM. Skin cancer history appears to determine LMM risk only, whereas the number of lifetime sunburns determines SSM only. Prevention strategies could be tailored differently given these distinctive points of difference.","title":"Risk factors for lentigo maligna melanoma compared with superficial spreading melanoma: a case-control study in Australia.","pubmedId":"22004881"}
