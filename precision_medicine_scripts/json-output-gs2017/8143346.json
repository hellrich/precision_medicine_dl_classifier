In particular, Ras proteins have been implicated as key intermediates that mediate the signal from upstream tyrosine kinases to a downstream cascade of serine/threonine kinases, which then activate nuclear factors that control gene expression and protein synthesis. How Ras proteins function is regulated in this role as a molecular switch, and how the signal is transmitted between the various components of the pathway, are now being determined. Finally, the Rho family of Ras-related proteins, which regulate the actin cytoskeleton, have also been implicated as mediators of oncogenic Ras transformation. The brisk pace at which the key components of Ras-mediated signal transduction pathways are being identified hold great promise that new targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer may now be identified.","title":"The Ras signal transduction pathway.","pubmedId":"8143346"}
