At diagnosis, half of the patients are over 70 years of age, and most present with advanced disease, for which chemotherapy is recommended as first-line treatment. However, the benefit from such therapy is modest and it is at times poorly tolerated. The discovery of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) has significantly impacted the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC. These novel agents demonstrate efficacy and a favorably mild toxicity profile. Despite limited data in elderly patients, the largest subpopulation in NSCLC, EGFR-TKIs are considered the standard of care therapy for advanced EGFR-positive disease in the elderly. In this review, we seek to compile the available data about the EGFR-TKIs use in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC, with the hope to better understand its role in this major yet, underrepresented, group of patients.
