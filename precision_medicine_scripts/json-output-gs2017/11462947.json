Here we investigated the incidence of p53, ras, bcl-2 and c-erbB-2 gene alterations in intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors and invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas by immunohistochemical method to identify and analyze their relationship in terms of these genetic alterations.\nFifty-four pancreatic lesions, including 18 benign (hyperplasia (3) and intraductal papillary adenoma (15)), and 16 malignant (carcinoma in situ (2) and intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma (14)) cases of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor; and 20 cases of invasive ductal adenocarcinoma, were immunostained by avidin-biotin peroxidase conjugate method.\np53 and rasp21 expressions were significantly greater in malignant intraductal (P \u003c 0.01, P \u003c 0.05) and invasive ductal (P \u003c 0.01, P \u003c 0.01) tumors than in benign intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors; while bcl-2 and c-erbB-2 expressions were significantly greater in invasive ductal adenocarcinoma than both benign (P \u003c 0.01, P \u003c 0.05) and malignant (P \u003c 0.05, P \u003c 0.05) intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors.\nDifferent groups of genetic alterations are involved in different phases of pancreatic tumorigenesis. p53 and ras gene alterations occur at an early stage during the development of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor, while additional alterations of bcl-2 and c-erbB-2 occur during the development of invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.","title":"Immunohistochemical study of genetic alterations in intraductal and invasive ductal tumors of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"11462947"}
