The demographic, perioperative, histopathologic, and outcome variables, including the recurrence and survival, were assessed.\nThe VATS lobectomy was successfully performed in 57 patients (16 women and 41 men; median age, 70 years). Twenty-three patients (40.4%) were aged 75 years or older. The total score of the Charlson comorbidity index was as follows: 2 in 26 patients, 3 in 13 patients, 4 in 12 patients, 5 in five patients, and 6 in one patient. None of the patients required a blood transfusion during surgery or during the postoperative course. We observed no intraoperative or in-hospital deaths, and no complications occurred in the 45 patients (78.9%). At a median follow-up of 34 months, a recurrence was observed in five patients who had advanced stages: a local recurrence in one and a distant recurrence in four. The overall 5-year survival rates for postoperative stage IA (n \u003d 25) and IB (n \u003d 16) were 100% and 94%, respectively.\nWe believe that a VATS lobectomy is a feasible and safe procedure for NSCLC in patients with comorbidity because this modality demonstrates an acceptable morbidity and a favorable oncologic outcome.","title":"Video-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer in patients with a Charlson comorbidity index score of two or more.","pubmedId":"19875973"}
