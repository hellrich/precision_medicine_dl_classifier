In this study, we performed chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and immunohistochemistry to evaluate for NF2 gene deletion in a group of sporadic meningiomas, schwannomas, and ependymomas. Twenty-two sporadic tumors, including 9 ependymomas, 10 meningiomas, and 3 schwannomas, were studied. CISH and immunohistochemistry were performed using the NF2 gene deletion probe and NF2 polyclonal antibody. Deletion of the NF2 gene was identified in 11 (50%) tumors, including 60% (6/10) of meningiomas, 33% (3/9) of ependymomas, and 67% (2/3) of schwannomas. The remaining 11 (50%) cases were diploid. Overall, immunoexpression of NF2 protein was observed in 50% (11/22) tumors, and concordance between CISH and immunohistochemistry was observed in 73% of cases. Our results support previous observations that schwannomas and meningiomas, and to a lesser degree, ependymomas, express a high incidence of NF2 gene deletion, which supports the hypothesis that NF2 gene plays an important role in their tumorigenesis. In addition, we have validated CISH as an efficient, economic, and reliable method for routinely assessing NF2 gene deletion in these tumors.","title":"Evaluation of NF2 gene deletion in sporadic schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas by chromogenic in situ hybridization.","pubmedId":"17509660"}
