Compared with other biliary tract neoplasms, these tumors have a relatively favorable prognosis after surgical resection. Based on their epithelium of origin, two subtypes of ampullary carcinoma have been recently distinguished: intestinal and pancreatobiliary. This study evaluates histopathological features and outcomes of ampullary carcinoma and to compares the survival of these tumors to that of other biliary tract tumors. The chemotherapic options available for ampullary cancer are also reviewed. We analyzed data from 20 consecutive patients with ampullary carcinomas and 26 patients with other biliary tract carcinomas, observed in our Institution. Statistical analysis was performed by using either Fisher\u0027s exact test or Ï‡(2) test for categorical variables. Median time of survival was calculated and compared using the Log-Rank test. Similar distribution of demographic characteristics and stage between ampullary and other biliary tract cancers was observed. Patients with ampullary cancer underwent surgery more frequently than other biliary cancers while chemotherapy and radiotherapy were used equally. In accordance with the literature, a longer median survival was observed in the group of ampullary carcinomas.","title":"Tumors of ampulla of Vater: A case series and review of chemotherapy options.","pubmedId":"22468185"}
