Thanks to the positive results of Phase II trials, alectinib was approved in Japan and by the US FDA for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients pretreated with crizotinib. Recently, the Phase III J-ALEX study demonstrated superiority of alectinib over crizotinib in crizotinib naive ALK-positive NSCLC, with an impressive improvement of progression-free survival. From the results and those expected of Phase III ALEX study, alectinib might become the frontline treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC. This article summarizes the therapeutic options in ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, and the chemical, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, metabolism and clinical efficacy of alectinib.","title":"Alectinib for treatment of ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"27780368"}
