EGFR mutation rate of the specimens with papillary, acinar or lepidic component was higher than without these components (P \u003c 0.05), and with solid or mucinous component was lower than that without the component (P \u003c 0.05). EGFR mutation in solid predominant mixed other subtypes was more commonly found than that of pure solid component (P\u003d0.018).\nThe presence of well-differentiated components in lung adenocarcinoma, such as lepidic, papillary and acinar, indicates a higher EGFR mutation rate, while the solid and mucinous component indicate a lower EGFR mutation rate. There is heterogeneity of EGFR mutation in lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Correlation of EGFR mutation and histological subtype according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification of lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25550848"}
