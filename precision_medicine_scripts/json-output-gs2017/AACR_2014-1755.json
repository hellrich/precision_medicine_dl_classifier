Therefore, blockades of c-Met and VEGFR2 simultaneously may yield synergistic inhibition on tumor growth.Methods and Results: CT053PTSA is a potent, orally bioavailable small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) against c-Met, VEGFR2 as well as Axl, Mer, and FLT3, all of which have been implicated in tumor pathogenesis. In cell-based assays, CT053PTSA showed IC50s of 6.7, 1.9 and \u003c 1.0 nM against c-Met, VEGFR-2 and Axl. In cell-based functional assays, CT053PTSA inhibited HGF and VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation and microvascular angiogenesis in rat aortic rings with IC50 values of 8.6 and 6.3 nM, respectively. When single dosed orally (3mg/kg) to U87MG tumor-bearing nude mice, CT053PTSA potently inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Met and its downstream signaling kinases AKT and ERK1/2 for up to 6 hours in tumor tissues.The antitumor efficacy of CT053PTSA was evaluated in human tumor subcutaneous xenograft models in athymic mice, which included Caki-1 (kidney carcinoma), U-87MG (glioblastoma), NCI-H441 (lung adenocarcinoma), MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma), SMMC-7721 (hepatoma), 5637 (bladder carcinoma) and SK-OV-3 (ovarian carcinoma). The ED50s of CT053PTSA to inhibit tumor growth in these studies ranged from \u003c 1mg/kg (NCI-H441) to  6 mg/kg (SMMC-7721). In orthotopic U87MG human glioblastoma xenograft model, CT053PTSA prolonged the median survival time (MST) and yielded significant increase in life-span value (ILS \u003d 32%, p \u003d 0.003) at an oral dose of 20 mg/kg/day (dosed 21 days) versus the vehicle-treated group.Conclusions: CT053PTSA displayed excellent oral bioavailability (\u003e 60% across animal species) and desirable drug exposures in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. Based on its potent antitumor activity, favorable PK profile and toxicological data, CT053PTSA was granted to enter clinical trials in China and is currently under phase I evaluation as a potential treatment for human malignancies.","title":"CT053PTSA, a novel c-MET and VEGFR2 inhibitor, potently suppresses angiogenesis and tumor growth","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1755"}
