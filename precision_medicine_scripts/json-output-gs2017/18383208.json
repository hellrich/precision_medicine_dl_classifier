The purpose of the present study was to analyze the genetic relationship between benign prostatic tissue, PIN, invasive cancer, IDC-P, and extracapsular tumor tissue to get further information about the role of IDC-P in the development of prostate cancer. One hundred five radical prostatectomy specimens were investigated immunohistochemically, 77 cases were analyzed by PCR for LOH of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and RB1, and 11 cases of IDC-P and 10 cases of PIN were investigated using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). At CGH analysis, IDC-P showed several chromosomal imbalances in contrast to PIN, where no changes were found. We could demonstrate a significant increase of LOH for TP53 or RB1 from benign tissue to PIN. LOH of both TP53 and RB1 were frequently found in IDC-P (52%), followed by extracapsular tumor tissue (44%), invasive cancer (24%), PIN (19%), and benign prostatic tissue (17%). Increased immunohistochemical expression was found in invasive cancer for TP53, RB1, and for PTEN. Decreased expression could be demonstrated in extracapsular tumor tissue and in IDC-P. Our results indicate that IDC-P in general follows the genetic pathway from normal epithelium over PIN lesion. IDC-P represents a separate prostatic lesion and should be graded as a poorly differentiated carcinoma.","title":"Chromosomal imbalances, loss of heterozygosity, and immunohistochemical expression of TP53, RB1, and PTEN in intraductal cancer, intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive adenocarcinoma of the prostate.","pubmedId":"18383208"}
