Prevention of this disease would have a major impact on disease-associated cost, morbidity, and mortality for a large segment of the population. A major advance in prevention of prostate cancer came in 2003 with the publication of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). This overview summarizes the results of that trial, the design of other large-scale trials, and advances in understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of other promising agents, including dutasteride, selenium, Vitamin E, Vitamin D, COX-2 inhibitors, lycopene, and green tea.","title":"Chemoprevention of prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"15780904"}
