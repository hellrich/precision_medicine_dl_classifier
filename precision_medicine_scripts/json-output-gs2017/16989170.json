The genetic alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are related to tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes. CCND1 gene, coding cyclin DI, in correlation with pRb is involved in regulation of cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Amplification of CCND1 gene and cyclin D1 over-expression was found in several cancers including head and neck cancers or colorectal cancer, where these alterations were correlated with worse prognosis. The literature addressing the clinical significance of CCND1 gene amplification/expression in NSCLC remains poor and prognostic value of these alterations in that cancer is still controversial.","title":"[Clinical significance of cyclin Dl expression in non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"16989170"}
