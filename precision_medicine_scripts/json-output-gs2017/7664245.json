One of these hsrs contains MYCN sequences. Reverse painting experiments demonstrated that the second HSR consisted of two chromosome 12-derived amplification units, located at 12q14-15 and 12q24. Southern blot and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed amplification of genes located at 12q14-15: SAS, MDM2, and CDK4, GLI, CHOP, CDK2, and A2MR were found not to be amplified. FISH further demonstrated amplification of RSN, a gene located at 12q24. The finding of two distinct chromosome 12 amplification units in a neuroblastoma cell line NGP is reminiscent of recent findings in well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) and other sarcomas. The second amplification unit on chromosome 12 in NGP is located more distal (12q24) than the one observed in WDLPS (12q21). The mechanism and biologic significance of this amplification process in neuroblastoma and WDLPS remain to be elucidated.","title":"Identification of two distinct chromosome 12-derived amplification units in neuroblastoma cell line NGP.","pubmedId":"7664245"}
