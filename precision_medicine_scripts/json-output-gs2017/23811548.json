The expression of MICA/B, ULBP1 and ULBP2 were also determined by flow cytometry. NK92-MI cytotoxic activity against heat-treated target cell lines was assessed by LDH release as well as annexin-V and 7-AAD assays.\nOur results showed that heat treatment at 39C improved the cytolytic activity of NK cells against SW-872 cells without increasing NKG2D ligand concentration or decreasing HLA class I levels.\nThe observed increase in the cytotoxicity of NK cells against SW-872 cells after hyperthermia does not coincide with changes in MICA/B, ULBP1 and ULBP2 ligands of NKG2, however, the expression of other ligands in target cells may have made the cells susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of NK cells.","title":"Hyperthermia increases natural killer cell cytotoxicity against SW-872 liposarcoma cell line.","pubmedId":"23811548"}
