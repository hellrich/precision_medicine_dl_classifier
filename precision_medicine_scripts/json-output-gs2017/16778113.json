More than 75% of those somatic mutations are clustered in the helical (exon 9) and kinase domains (exon 20). The three hot-spot mutations, E542K, E545K, and H1047R, have been proven to elevate the lipid kinase activity of PIK3CA and activate the Akt signaling pathway. The mutational status of PIK3CA in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm/carcinoma (IPMN/IPMC) has not been evaluated previously.\nTo evaluate a possible role for PIK3CA in the tumorigenesis of IPMN and IPMC, exons 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 18, and 20 were analyzed in 36 IPMN/IPMC and two mucinous cystadenoma specimens by direct genomic DNA sequencing.\nWe identified four missense mutations in the nine screened exons of PIK3CA from 36 IPMN/IPMC specimens (11%). One of the four mutations, H1047R, has been previously reported as a hot-spot mutation. The remaining three mutations, T324I, W551G, and S1015F, were novel and somatic.\nThis is the first report of PIK3CA mutation in pancreatic cancer. Our data provide evidence that the oncogenic properties of PIK3CA contribute to the tumorigenesis of IPMN/IPMC.","title":"PIK3CA mutations in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm/carcinoma of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"16778113"}
