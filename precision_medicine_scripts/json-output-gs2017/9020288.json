The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect and safety of the two platinum compounds in combination with etoposide in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSLC). Forty patients were registered. Based on the results of a phase I study, patients were treated with CDDP (80 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1), CBDCA (280 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1), and etoposide (80 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1-3). Of the 40 patients, 30 were men and 10 women. Histology revealed adenocarcinoma(AC) (n \u003d 20), squamous cell carcinoma(SCC) (n \u003d 18), and large cell carcinoma(LCC) (n \u003d 2). Staging: IIIA (n \u003d 3); IIIB (n \u003d 17); and IV (n \u003d 20). A 32.5% overall response rate [13 of 40; 95% confidence interval (CI) 18-47%] was achieved. The response rates in patients with SCC and AC were 55.6 and 10.0% (p \u003c 0.005), respectively. The median duration of response was 47.1 weeks and the overall median survival time was 57.1 weeks. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia--World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV--occurred in nine and 11 patients, respectively. Nonhematological toxicities were mainly nausea, vomiting, and alopecia. In conclusion, further investigations of this regimen are warranted in the treatment of NSLC.","title":"A phase II study of carboplatin-cisplatin-etoposide combination chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"9020288"}
