Most patients in the developed countries present with disease either confined to the cervix or with limited extension beyond it. Historically, the standard treatment was usually radiotherapy or radical hysterectomy with node dissection. In 1999, five randomized clinical trials performed by the Gynecologic Oncology Group, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the Southwest Oncology Group have demonstrated a significant outcome advantage when cisplatin-based chemotherapy was administered during radiation in patients with cervical cancer. In the current review, we will analyze the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and surgery as an alternative option treatment to the standard chemoradiation for locally advanced cervical cancer (stage Ib2 or larger).","title":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: an alternative option of treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"17878736"}
