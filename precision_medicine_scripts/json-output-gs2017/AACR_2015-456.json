Of these molecular classifications, KRAS represents about 30% of all lung adenocarcinomas. Our group has recently investigated if co-mutations within KRAS-mutated lung tumors can aid in identifying a unique therapeutic strategy for patient treatment. Given that tumors exert a strong influence over the immune system and the recent successes in immune targeting via checkpoint blockade therapy in various cancers, including lung, we hypothesized that co-mutational subgroups of KRAS-mutant NSCLC elicit distinct immune profiles and support a rationale for evaluating these subgroups in conjunction with appropriate immunotherapies for further clinical testing. To investigate this phenomenon, we performed a supervised analysis of 86 immune-related genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas data set in lung adenocarcinomas with KRAS mutations and TP53 or STK11(LKB1) co-mutations. The results from our analysis revealed that KRAS-mutant NSCLC with LKB1 (KL) and TP53 (KP) co-mutations have distinct immune profiles. KP tumors have an increase in (1) PD-L1 and PD-L2; (2) co-stimulation via CD40, CD80, CD86; (3) antigen presentation HLA-I, HLA-II, and CD1; (4) FOXP3 and CD4, indicating T regulatory populations; (5) CD33, CD11b, and CD11c, which are potentially suppressive myeloid cell populations. We conclude that KRAS co-mutations can create significantly different immune microenvironments; KRAS + TP53 (KP) mutant tumors may specifically benefit from checkpoint blockade, depletion of immunosuppressive myeloid and T regulatory populations, but could support de novo anti-tumor T cell expansion due to high expression of co-stimulatory molecules and HLA-I and HLA-II expression. Conversely, KRAS + LKB1 (KL) mutant tumors have an immunosuppressed or inert phenotype and may potentially benefit from adoptive cell transfer of anti-tumor T cells in conjunction with or in lieu of checkpoint blockade.","title":"Defined co-mutation subgroups of KRAS-mutated NSCLC display distinct immune profiles","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-456"}
