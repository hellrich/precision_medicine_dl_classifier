Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is valuable in confirming the malignant nature of these unresectable lesions. Benign pancreatic lesions and metastatic neoplasms can also be evaluated by fine-needle aspiration. We undertook a retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy of FNA in assessing pancreatic masses. Three hundred and sixty-four radiologically guided FNAs of the pancreas performed between 1986-1996 were reviewed. Surgical material was also evaluated when available and compared to the FNA material. There were 223 men and 141 women. Their ages ranged from 23-90, with a mean of 64 yr. Two hundred and twelve patients (58%) had primary malignant tumors, 183 had adenocarcinomas, 15 had mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, 12 had neuroendocrine tumors, and 2 had pleomorphic giant-cell carcinomas. Ninety-one (43%) had available surgical material which showed adenocarcinoma. Ninety-one patients (25%) had benign aspirates, including 53 showing benign ductal epithelium, 23 showing pancreatitis/inflammation. 10 showing pseudocysts, and 7 showing serous cystadenomas. Surgical material was available in 24 (26%) of these patients. Two of these showed adenocarcinoma. Sixteen aspirates (4%) were suspicious for malignancy, 13 (81%) of which showed adenocarcinoma on follow-up biopsies. Twenty-two aspirates (6%) showed metastatic neoplasms. Twenty-three (6%) had unsatisfactory specimens. Ten (43%) of these had follow-up biopsies, 3 of which were malignant. FNA of primary benign and malignant pancreatic masses is highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%). Eighty-one percent of the suspicious lesions showed adenocarcinoma on follow-up biopsy. FNA of metastatic neoplasms to the pancreas is also very accurate. This technique can be useful in avoiding unnecessary surgery.","title":"Pancreatic masses: a multi-institutional study of 364 fine-needle aspiration biopsies with histopathologic correlation.","pubmedId":"9839131"}
