However, little is known about the prognostic value of CTHRC1 in PDAC. In current study, we investigated the expression pattern and underlying clinical significance of CTHRC1 in PDAC. Data from public PDAC microarray datasets, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CTHRC1 expression was dramatically increased in PDAC compared with normal tissues at both mRNA and protein level, which was consistent with previous studies. Analysis of its correlation with clinicopathological parameters indicated that high protein expression level of CTHRC1 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion and perineural invasion. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with higher CTHRC1 expression exhibited a remarkably shorter overall survival in four different PDAC patient cohorts. Importantly, univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that CTHRC1 protein expression level was a significant and independent prognostic factor for overall survival rate of PDAC patients. Together, these data suggested that CTHRC1 is an unfavorable biomarker of prognosis in PDAC and may serve as a potential therapeutic candidate for PDAC treatment.
