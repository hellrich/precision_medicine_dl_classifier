The therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin is limited by the development of resistance. In this study, we test the effect of RNA interference (RNAi) targeting Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway upstream genes on the sensitivity of cisplatin-sensitive (A549 and SK-MES-1) and -resistant (A549/DDP) lung cancer cells to cisplatin.\nUsing small interfering RNA (siRNA), knockdown of FANCF, FANCL, or FANCD2 inhibited function of the FA/BRCA pathway in A549, A549/DDP and SK-MES-1 cells, and potentiated sensitivity of the three cells to cisplatin. The extent of proliferation inhibition induced by cisplatin after knockdown of FANCF and/or FANCL in A549/DDP cells was significantly greater than in A549 and SK-MES-1 cells, suggesting that depletion of FANCF and/or FANCL can reverse resistance of cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells to cisplatin. Furthermore, knockdown of FANCL resulted in higher cisplatin sensitivity and dramatically elevated apoptosis rates compared with knockdown of FANCF in A549/DDP cells, indicating that FANCL play an important role in the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage.\nKnockdown of FANCF, FANCL, or FANCD2 by RNAi could synergize the effect of cisplatin on suppressing cell proliferation in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells through inhibition of FA/BRCA pathway.","title":"RNA interferences targeting the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway upstream genes reverse cisplatin resistance in drug-resistant lung cancer cells.","pubmedId":"26385482"}
