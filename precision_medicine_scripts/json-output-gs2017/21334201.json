Correlation with clinical outcome and response to Imatinib or Sunitinib therapy was performed.\nIn 13 PT c-kit mutations in exon 9 (3), exon 11 (7) and exon 13 (1), 2 wild type genotypes, and no PDGFRα mutation were detected. In three metastases a switch from heterozygosity to homozygosity and one additional exon 13 mutation was observed. All 10 persons with available follow-up received Imatinib as first-line chemotherapy. Five of them (3 exon 9 mutations, 1 wild type, 1 additional exon 13 mutation) stopped Imatinib due to tumour progression. In three cases, Sunitinib as second-line chemotherapy was ended due to the same reasons.\nOur data support previous observations, that PDGFRα mutations play no important role in metastasized GISTs. The influence of Imatinib and Sunitinib therapy in metastasized GISTs with wild type genotype and c-kit exon 9 mutations needs further investigation.","title":"Mutational spectrum and therapy response of metastasized GIST in Central Switzerland - a population-based study.","pubmedId":"21334201"}
