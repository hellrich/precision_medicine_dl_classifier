We describe the anesthetic management of orthotopic liver transplantation for a patient with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mitral insufficiency. In this case, transesophageal echocardiography proved useful in the management of the postreperfusion period of the surgical procedure.","title":"Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in orthotopic liver transplantation in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","pubmedId":"7669317"}
