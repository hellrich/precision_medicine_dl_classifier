The patient with stage IB2 (bulky) cervical cancer represents a therapeutic challenge. Neither radical hysterectomy nor primary radiation therapy are sufficiently effective and are associated with significant treatment-related complications including ovarian failure and psychosexual deficits. A number of phase III studies have explored alternative management approaches in this patient population. It appears that extrafascial hysterectomy following radiation therapy does not improve overall survival relative to radiation therapy alone. Consistent with results seen in locally advanced cervical carcinoma, chemoradiation therapy is superior to radiation therapy alone as primary treatment for stage IB2 cervical cancer and as adjuvant therapy for surgically treated patients with high-risk factors for recurrence. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has resulted in high clinical response rates and operability rates. There are two phase III trials suggesting an improvement in survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical hysterectomy versus either surgery (and selected postoperative radiation) or radiation therapy alone. These emerging treatments should be scrutinized in prospective controlled trials.","title":"Treatment of stage IB2 (bulky) cervical carcinoma.","pubmedId":"12972358"}
