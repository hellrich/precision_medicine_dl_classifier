We should therefore advance to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and then cytological and/or pathological assessment of the pancreatic duct whenever non-continuous narrowing, localized dilatation, or other irregularities are encountered.","title":"Widespread and multifocal carcinomas in situ (CISs) through almost the entire pancreas: report of a case with preoperative cytological diagnosis.","pubmedId":"20013290"}
