But the status of KRAS and BRAF mutations and their clinicopathologic and prognostic significance has not been extensively evaluated in small intestinal adenocarcinomas. In this work, the KRAS and BRAF genes in 190 surgically resected small intestinal adenocarcinoma cases were sequenced and their association with various clinicopathologic variables, including survival of the patients, was analyzed. KRAS or BRAF mutations were observed in 63 (33%) cases. Sixty-one cases had KRAS mutations and 2 had BRAF mutations and the two types of mutation were mutually exclusive. The majority of KRAS mutations were G\u003eA transition (43/61 cases, 71%) or p.G12D (31/61 cases, 51%). The patients with mutant KRAS tended to have higher pT classifications (P\u003d0.034) and more frequent pancreatic invasion (P\u003d0.020) than those with wild-type KRAS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that certain mutated KRAS subtypes (G\u003eA transitions and G12D mutations) were significantly correlated with higher pT classification (P\u003d0.015 and 0.004, respectively) than wild-type KRAS and other KRAS mutations. The patients with KRAS or BRAF mutation had a tendency to shorter overall survival than those with wild-type KRAS and BRAF (P\u003d0.148), but subgroup analysis demonstrated the patients with KRAS mutations showed worse survival (median, 46.0 months; P\u003d0.046) than those with wild-type KRAS (85.4 months) in lower pT classification (pT1-pT3) group. In summary, KRAS and, infrequently, BRAF mutations are observed in a subset of small intestinal adenocarcinomas, and are associated with higher pT classification and more frequent pancreatic invasion. KRAS mutation is a poor prognostic predictor in patients with lower pT classification tumors. Anti-EGFR targeted therapy could be applied to about two-thirds of small intestinal adenocarcinoma patients, namely those with wild-type KRAS and BRAF if they have metastatic disease, similar to colorectal cancer patients.
