AAA was defined as infrarenal abdominal aorta diameter ≥ 3.0 cm or history of AAA repair. Non-cases were participants without known AAA. A GRS was calculated using 4 SNPs associated with AAA at genome-wide significance (P ≤ 10(-8)). The GRS was associated with the presence of AAA after adjustment for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and family history of aortic aneurysm: odds ratio (OR, 95% confidence interval, CI) 1.06 (1.04-1.09, p \u003c 0.001). Adding GRS to conventional risk factors improved the association of presence of AAA (net reclassification index 14%, p \u003c 0.001). In a subset of patients with AAA who had ≥ 2 imaging studies (n \u003d 651, mean (SE) growth rate 2.47 (0.11) mm/year during a mean time interval of 5.41 years), GRS, baseline size, diabetes and family history were each associated with aneurysm growth rate in univariate association (all p \u003c 0.05). The estimated mean aneurysm growth rate was 0.50 mm/year higher in those with GRS \u003e median (5.78) than those with GRS ≤ median (p \u003d 0.01), after adjustment for baseline size (p \u003c 0.001), diabetes (p \u003d 0.046) and family history of aortic aneurysm (p \u003d 0.02).\nA multi-locus GRS was associated with presence of AAA and greater aneurysm expansion.","title":"A multi-locus genetic risk score for abdominal aortic aneurysm.","pubmedId":"26820802"}
