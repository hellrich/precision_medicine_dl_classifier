There is increasing evidence that the presence of an ongoing systemic inflammatory response is associated with poor outcome in patients undergoing resection for a variety of common solid tumors. Our aim was to prospectively evaluate the prognostic value of tumor- and patient-related factors including the systemic inflammatory response in patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas.\nThe prognostic impact of tumor factors such as stage and host factors, including the systemic inflammatory response (modified Glasgow Prognostic Score [mGPS]), were evaluated in a prospective study of 135 patients who underwent elective pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from January 2002 to April 2009.\nIn addition to the established tumor-related pathological factors (in particular margin involvement; hazard ratio [HR] 2.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65-4.84, P \u003c 0.001), an elevated mGPS (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.43-3.57, P \u003c 0.001) was independently associated with lower overall survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Additionally, in an adjuvant therapy subgroup of 74 patients, both margin involvement and an elevated mGPS remained independently associated with reduced overall survival.\nWe have prospectively validated the influence of tumor-related and patient-related factors. Margin involvement and the preoperative mGPS were the most important determinants of overall survival in patients undergoing potentially curative pancreaticoduodenectomy. Furthermore, both had independent prognostic value in those patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. In the future, this may be considered a stratification factor for entry onto therapeutic trials.","title":"A prospective comparison of the prognostic value of tumor- and patient-related factors in patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"21267785"}
