It can be done with low morbidity and mortality rates, particularly when performed at high-volume hospitals and by high-volume surgeons. While it has been conventionally reserved for patients with early-stage malignant disease, it is being used increasingly for patients with locally extensive tumors who have undergone neoadjuvant therapy and downstaging. This article summarizes the role of pancreaticoduodenectomy for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. It highlights the surgical staging of disease, the technical aspects of the operation and perioperative care, and the oncologic outcome.
