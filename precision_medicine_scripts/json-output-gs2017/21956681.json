This study was undertaken to investigate the frequency of Y chromosome losses and this chromosomal abnormality might play a potential role in prostate cancer.\nA preexisting prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA) containing samples of 3,261 patients treated by radical prostatectomy with clinical follow-up data was used in this study. TMA sections were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a dual labeling probe for the centromeres of the X and Y chromosome.\nUnequivocal losses of the Y chromosome were seen in only 12 of 2,053 analyzable cases. No significant associations were found between Y loss and patient age, pT stage, and the risk of PSA recurrence. Interestingly, in our study the presence of Y losses was significantly associated with high Gleason grade (P \u003d 0.0034).\nLoss of the Y chromosome is a rare event in prostate cancer. Y losses occur in much higher rates in most other cancer types. For this reason, we suggest that the expression of at least one Y chromosome gene is essential for prostate epithelial cells and it is possible that such a gene could represent a suitable target for future therapy of prostate cancer.","title":"Y chromosome losses are exceedingly rare in prostate cancer and unrelated to patient age.","pubmedId":"21956681"}
