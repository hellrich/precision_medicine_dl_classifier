The KRAS/BRAF mutation spectrum and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were successfully analyzed in 100 of the 126 CRLM tissues and these findings were examined in relation to the patients\u0027 clinical outcomes.\nThe cohort of 100 CRLM patients consisted of 46 with synchronous and 54 with metachronous liver metastasis. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 years were 57.4 and 24.9 %, respectively. MSI analysis revealed that none of the 100 CRLM specimens showed any evidence of MSI. By KRAS/BRAF mutation analysis, the analyzed CRLM patients were divided into 3 groups; KRAS-mutant (KRAS-Mt; n \u003d 27), BRAF-mutant (BRAF-Mt; n \u003d 3), and wild-types of both genes (Wild-type; n \u003d 70). In the survival analysis, both KRAS-Mt and BRAF-Mt patients showed significantly poorer prognoses compared with Wild-type patients. Furthermore, although the population with the BRAF mutation was small, this mutation had a significant negative impact on disease-free survival.\nIn this study, all tumors in the cohort of CRLM patients were non-MSI tumors, suggesting MSI cancer in primary CRC would rarely reveal metastatic potential. KRAS and BRAF mutations are suggested to be poor prognostic factors in CRLM. Genetic information has an essential role as a prognostic marker and could contribute to the decisions on treatment strategy for CRLM.","title":"Poor prognosis of KRAS or BRAF mutant colorectal liver metastasis without microsatellite instability.","pubmedId":"23010994"}
