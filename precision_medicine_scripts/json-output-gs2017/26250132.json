Obstructive jaundice caused by common bile duct (CBD) stones was diagnosed based on the results of blood tests, abdominal computed tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. We attempted to remove the CBD stones endoscopically. After endoscopic sphincterotomy, a polypoid lesion was exposed at the ampulla of Vater. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen from the ampullary lesion revealed a tubular adenoma, and the patient underwent pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. Pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed a polyp-type ampullary carcinoma-in-adenoma arising from the ampullary channel. Herein, we report a rare case of polyp-type ampullary carcinoma-in-adenoma displaying an intraductal growth pattern.
