No mutation was detected in normal human pancreatic tissue and endocrine tumors. By our experience, SSCP is more convenient and faster than dot blot in detecting gene mutation. Point mutation at codon 12 of c-Ki-ras oncogene may play an important role in the development of human pancreatic carcinoma.","title":"[Point mutation at codon 12 of c-Ki-ras oncogene in human pancreatic neoplasms and normal human pancreas tissue].","pubmedId":"7805165"}
