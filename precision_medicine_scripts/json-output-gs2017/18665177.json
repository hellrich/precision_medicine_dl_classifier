Several laboratories are now screening for this mutation in different malignancies, and, recently, the mutation was described by Malanga et al in 1.9% of lung cancer patients. Considering the importance of the PI3K/AKT pathway in mediating survival and antiapoptotic signals in the B-cell types of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), we sequenced the AKT1 exon 3 for the above mentioned mutation in 87 specimens, representing 45 CLLs, 38 ALLs and 4 prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) cases, which are all of B-cell origin. Our results show that the mutation E17K/AKT1 was not detected in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1 of the investigated cases. We conclude that this mutation is not a major event in B-cell-derived lymphoid leukaemias.","title":"The transforming mutation E17K/AKT1 is not a major event in B-cell-derived lymphoid leukaemias.","pubmedId":"18665177"}
