In older patients \u003e 70 years of age, the proportion of individuals who never have smoked increases up to one in three individuals. Severe disease is present in 10%, and the limitation of performance is usually caused by airway obstruction, in a smaller portion of patients by the loss of alveolar surface (emphysema). After medical treatment with antiobstructive and anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen remains a major therapy option. With it, hypercapnic patients benefit most from long-term therapy. Patients with predominant emphysema benefit most from high-flow (6-8 l/min) oxygen therapy during exercise. Permanent yellow or greenish sputum decoloration is suggestive of chronic bacterial colonization. This group of patients may benefit from a permanent inhalative therapy with antibiotics (mainly aminoglycosides). There is growing evidence from current literature to support this concept. If dyspnea is severe, especially during mild exercise, a subset of patients might benefit from the use of long-acting morphium. Goal of this therapy is to downregulate breathing control. Predominantly \"pink puffers\" seem to respond. A dose of 10-20 mg will usually be sufficient. Life-threatening hypercapnia is usually not observed with this form of therapy. Noninvasive ventilation is an option for patients with severe hypercapnia. Thereby, ventilatory pressure or inspiratory volume should be selected to effectively unload the respiratory muscles. This will increase quality of life. Life span is likely to be prolonged, however, comparative data where patients were effectively ventilated (as seen on the reduction of hypercapnia) are missing. A multicenter trial addressing this topic is currently being conducted in Germany. Independent of the severity of COPD, patients in general benefit from physical training with alternation of endurance and interval training being most effective. This will decrease the number of hospital admissions and probably mortality as well. Lung volume reduction surgery virtually treats lung hyperinflation. Bullectomy is still considered effective for isolated bullous emphysema as well as lobectomy, if this portion of the lung is without function. Shaving procedures are still associated with high rates of complications and should only be performed in selected cases. Effectiveness of endoscopic lung volume reduction surgery by implantation of plugs or valves cannot be assessed yet. First data are rather disappointing. Ultimate alternative remains lung transplantation with life expectancy ranging between 5-6 years independent of age. Indeed, consequent application of previously described measures might preserve a stable state over many years.","title":"[Clinical Year in Review - advanced COPD].","pubmedId":"17992482"}
