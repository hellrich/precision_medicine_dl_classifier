We evaluated tumor samples obtained from a large repository to determine prevalent targetable molecular aberrations in these rare tumors.  Methods:  Seventy-eight SCCC samples were profiled, 53 of those on a commercial multiplatform, including a combination of gene sequencing (Sanger or NGS, up to 47 genes), amplification (CISH or FISH), and protein expression (IHC). Twenty-five samples were analyzed at a cancer center using a 50 gene NGS platform (CMS50). The profiles were compared to ~800 HPV+ cervical cancers (CC), neuroendocrine tumors (NET, all sites), and small cell lung cancers profiled at the same laboratory.  Results:  TOP2A (85%) and TOPO1 (55%) had high overexpression, while ERCC1 had low expression (11%) in SCCC samples. SCCC tumors had higher protein expression of KIT (26%) than HPV+ non-SCCC (7%, p \u003c 0.05), but similar expression of KIT to small cell lung cancers (37%). HER2 amplification was identified in 4.5% of SCCC and 8% of HPV+ CC. EGFR amplification was not seen in SCCC but was identified in 10% of HPV+ CC. Gene sequencing identified higher mutation rates for TP53 (27%) and KRAS (18%) in SCCC compared to HPV+ CC (12% and 7%, respectively) but lower rates of PIK3CA (17% vs. 28%). Comparatively, small cell lung cancers had mutations in TP53 in 34% of cases and in KRAS in 5% of cases. NGS evaluation of 51 cases also identified 3 GNAS and RB1mutations (6%), 2 CTNNB1 and SMAD4 mutations (4%), and single gene mutations in BRCA1, PTEN, MET, SMARCB1, APC, ATM, HNF1A, and FBXW7 (2% each).  Conclusions:    Multiplatform tumor profiling identified high expression of TOP2A and TOPO1 in SCCC, which may explain the sensitivity to etoposide and topotecan, while low levels of ERCC1 raise concern for cisplatinum resistance. Potential druggable mutations include AKT1, KRAS, PIK3CA, and TP53. We have identified one patient with a KRAS mutation treated with a MEK inhibitor who had a complete response and remains in remission at 12 months.","title":"Evaluation of biomarker alterations in small cell cervical cancer identifies therapeutic options.","pubmedId":"ASCO_152185-156"}
