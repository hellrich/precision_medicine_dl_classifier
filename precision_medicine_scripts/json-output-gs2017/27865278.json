Adjuvant therapy in patients after surgical resection is associated with improved overall survival. Adjuvant treatment approaches may include either chemotherapy alone or a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Neoadjuvant approaches, also including either chemotherapy alone or a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, are under investigation. Periampullary cancers constitute a rare and heterogeneous group of tumors that are typically treated as pancreatic cancers given their histologic similarities and tumor location.","title":"Adjuvant and Neoadjuvant Therapy for Resectable Pancreatic and Periampullary Cancer.","pubmedId":"27865278"}
