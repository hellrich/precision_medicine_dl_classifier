In our previous study, through miRNA microarray and experiments, we have emphasized that miR-222 could promote the ADR-resistance in breast cancer cells. The aim of this study was to explore the possible mechanism by which miR-222 affects sensitivity to ADR.\nThrough pathway enrichment analyses for miR-222, we found that PTEN/Akt/FOXO1 signaling pathway may be of importance. RT-qPCR analyses and western blot assays confirmed the relationship between miR-222 expression and target genes. Immunofluorescence further visually displayed the location of FOXO1. When blocking PTEN/Akt/FOXO1 signaling pathway, we demonstrated the effects of miR-222-mediated ADR resistance by MTT and apoptosis assays.\nRT-qPCR and Western blot results showed that miR-222 expression was negatively correlated with FOXO1 expression. In addition, the subcellular translocation of FOXO1 due to the altered expression of miR-222 was observed from immunofluorescence. Moreover, upregulation of miR-222 expression in MCF-7/S cells is associated with decreased PTEN expression levels and increased phospho-Akt (p-Akt) expression. Conversely in MCF-7/ADR cells, inhibition of miR-222 resulted in increased PTEN expression and decreased p-Akt expression. For further validation, results of the present study also demonstrated that PTEN/Akt/FOXO1 signaling was responsible for the ADR-resistance of breast cancer cells since LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt signaling, partially increased the sensitivity of MCF-7/S cells to ADR. More importantly, we postulated that high expression of miR-222 is closely related to poor overall survival by TCGA database validation.\nTaken together, these data elucidated that miR-222 mediated ADR-resistance of breast cancer cells partly through regulation of PTEN/Akt/FOXO1 signaling pathway and inhibition of miR-222 may improve the prognosis of breast cancer patients.","title":"MiR-222 promotes drug-resistance of breast cancer cells to adriamycin via modulation of PTEN/Akt/FOXO1 pathway.","pubmedId":"27746366"}
