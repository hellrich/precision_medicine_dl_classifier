Cases in which the timing for sentinel lymph node biopsy is controversial. Co-expression of estrogen receptors and Her2/neu (c-erbB-2) in breast cancer may imply hormone resistance, especially to tamoxifen. We present a clinic case with co-expression of estrogen receptors and Her2/neu that was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and previous sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by breasttumorectomy with axillar lymphadenectomy, radiotherapy and hormonotherapy with letrozol, geserelina and trastuzumab. A good treatment response was found.","title":"[Co-expression of estrogen receptors and Her2/neu in breast cancer.
