In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, the expression rates of CK7, CK19, MOC31, claudin 4 and HMGA1 were 83.4%, 89.0%, 88.2%, 69.2%, and 31.5%, respectively. These rates of expression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas were all higher than in those in hepatocellular carcinomas (CK7, 31.3%; CK19, 10.1%; MOC31, 34.0%; claudin 4, 11.2%; and HMGA1, 19.5%). The expression rates of GPC3, CD10, and biglycan were 72.6%, 39.7% and 10.0%, respectively, in hepatocellular carcinoma. These were higher than the rates found in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (GPC3, 7.0%; CD10, 18.1%; and biglycan, 7.0%). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, GPC3, CK19, MOC31 and claudin 4 were found to be independent markers for differentially diagnosing intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\nBased on our results, GPC3 and CK19 can be used as first-line markers for differential diagnoses of hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (accuracy rate, 73.5%), and additional combined screening for claudin 4 and MOC31 markers in GPC3(-) and CK19(-) tumors might increase the accuracy rate for distinguishing hepatocellular carcinoma from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma to 88.5%.","title":"Comparative analysis of immunohistochemical markers for differential diagnosis of hepatocelluar carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23052165"}
