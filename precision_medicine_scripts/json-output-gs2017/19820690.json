However, cytogenetic identification of ring and giant rod chromosomes supports the diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma/atypical lipomatous tumor. These abnormal chromosomes are mainly composed of amplified genomic sequences derived from chromosome 12q13-15, and contain several genes, including MDM2, CDK4 (SAS), TSPAN31, HMGA2, and others. MDM2 is consistently amplified in well-differentiated liposarcomas/atypical lipomatous tumors, and up to 25% in other sarcomas. As part of a large genomic study of lipomatous neoplasms, we initially found CPM to be consistently amplified in well-differentiated liposarcomas/atypical lipomatous tumors. To further explore this initial finding, we investigated the copy number status of MDM2 and CPM by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on a series of 138 tumors and 17 normal tissues, including 32 well-differentiated liposarcoma/atypical lipomatous tumors, 63 lipomas, 11 pleomorphic lipomas, 2 lipoblastomas, 30 other tumors and 17 normal fat samples. All 32 well-differentiated liposarcoma/atypical lipomatous tumors showed amplification of MDM2 and CPM, usually \u003e20 copies per cell. The other tumors lacked MDM2 and/or CPM amplification. Chromogenic in situ hybridization confirmed the above results on a subset of these tumors (n\u003d27). These findings suggest that identification of CPM amplification could be used as an alternative diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma/atypical lipomatous tumors.","title":"Carboxypeptidase M: a biomarker for the discrimination of well-differentiated liposarcoma from lipoma.","pubmedId":"19820690"}
