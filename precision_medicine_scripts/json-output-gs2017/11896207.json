Because a number of tumor suppressor genes are known to be silenced by aberrant promoter methylation, we examined the methylation status of the 5\u0027 CpG islands of PTEN using methylation-specific PCR. The altered expression of PTEN in 310 gastric carcinomas was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining using tissue-array and clinicopathologic profiles related to PTEN expression were characterized. Of 310 consecutive gastric carcinomas, 62 cases (20%) showed expression loss of PTEN. Altered PTEN expression was significantly associated with tumor depth and size, lymphatic invasion, advanced stage, pTNM stage, and patient survival (p \u003c 0.001). The promoter methylation frequency of PTEN was found to be present in 26 (39%) of 66 cases examined, and 19 (73%) of 26 gastric cancer tissues showing promoter methylation exhibited the loss of PTEN expression. Abnormalities in the expression of PTEN significantly correlated with promoter methylation (p \u003c 0.001). In conclusion, silencing of the PTEN gene occurs frequently in gastric carcinoma and aberrant promoter methylation is a major mechanism of silencing of the PTEN gene. The abnormalities of the PTEN gene are associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and survival.","title":"Promoter methylation and silencing of PTEN in gastric carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11896207"}
