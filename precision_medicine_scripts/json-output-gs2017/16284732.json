The above values were estimated from the 8th to 10th week. There was no significant difference in the density of positive cells in the mantle zone of the islets from the 13th to the 24th week, and the neoplastic tissue of mixed (P5\u003d0.16) and pure ductal type (P6\u003d0.65).\nThe immunostaining for somatostatin identifies a subgroup of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas with a neuroendocrine component, (initially considered as pure ductal tumors), and mixed ductal and neuroendocrine tumors. This pattern of expression in neoplasms recapitulates the normal pattern during the embryonal development of the organ, raising the question of therapeutic efficacy of somatostatin and analogues as monotherapy in pancreatic cancer management.","title":"Distribution of somatostatin in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remodels the normal pattern of the protein during foetal pancreatic development: an immunohistochemical analysis.","pubmedId":"16284732"}
