PI3K has become an important drug target for cancer therapy, since gain-of-function mutations of PIK3CA encoding PI3Kalpha, as well as loss-of-function mutations of PTEN, have been frequently found in human cancers. The pharmaceutical development of PI3K inhibitors has made a great leap forward during the last 3 years. While PI3Kbeta, delta and gamma isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors (TGX-221, IC87114 and AS-605240) have been developed for therapy of coronary heart disease, asthma, and glomerulonephritis, respectively, a promising PI3Kalpha specific inhibitor is not yet available. Correspondingly, almost all of the promising PI3K inhibitors under development for caner therapy, such as NVP-BEZ235, GDC-0941 and ZSTK474, are pan-PI3K isoform inhibitors. Each of these pan-PI3K inhibitors seems to induce a common G1 phase arrest. All have shown favorable in vivo anticancer efficacies and low toxicities, and therefore most have entered evaluation in clinical trials. P-Akt and p-S6 have been reported to be feasible pharmacodynamic biomarkers for monitoring the efficacy of these agents. In the process of discovery of these and other PI3K inhibitors, detailed structure-activity relationship studies were carried out. This review summarizes key advances in the development of PI3K inhibitors, which is preceded by an introduction of PI3K family and their functions.","title":"Advances in development of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors.","pubmedId":"19689267"}
