Prognostic factors were also analyzed.\nFifty-two cases were treated with curative resection, 21 with palliative resection, and 9 with nonoperative drainage. Eleven cases underwent palliative drainage operations. The median survive time was 31 months in the curative resection group, 13.7 months in the palliative resection group, and 11 months in the nonoperative drainage group. Patient age, serum total bilirubin, clinical type of Bismuth-Corlette, tumor differentiation, and lymph node metastases were important factors for predicting the prognosis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.\nResection was the main treatment for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and curative resection was the best way to obtain better prognosis. Age, preoperative serum total bilirubin, bismuth clinical type, tumor histopathological grading, and lymph node metastases were considered to have a significant effect on prognosis.","title":"Surgical treatment and prognostic analysis of 93 cases of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20220331"}
