Acquisition of M2 (alternatively activated) phenotype by TAM during tumor progression enhances the immunosuppressive and tumor-supportive properties of TAM resulting in tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Previously we have found that stabilin-1, a multifunctional scavenger/sorting receptor, is a marker of M2 macrophages that is expressed by TAM in several murine tumor models. However, its role in tumor progression was not defined.In order to identify the role of stabilin-1 in tumor progression, the model of mammary adenocarcinoma (TS/A) was established in BALB/c mice with stabilin-1 knockout. The growth of TS/A mammary adenocarcinoma in stabilin-1 knockout (ko) mice was suppressed by 36%. To identify the role of stabilin-1 in TAM biology and reveal functions of stabilin-1 that are important for tumor progression, isolation of high purity TAM from TS/A murine adenocarcinoma was established and optimized. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that adhesion/internalisation of extracellular SPARC was decreased in the isolated stabilin-1 ko TAM compared to wt TAM. Immunofluorescent/confocal microscopy showed that transport of SPARC into the endocytic pathway was significantly impaired in the stabilin-1 ko TAM. Since SPARC is known to inhibit the development of solid tumors including breast cancer we hypothesize that knockout of stabilin-1 in TAM induces accumulation of extracellular SPARC resulting in suppression of tumor growth. Analysis of two cohorts of female patients with breast carcinoma of different stages demonstrated that stabilin-1 is expressed on significant part of tumor associated macrophages. Three types of TAM were identified by co-staining with anti-stabilin-1 RS1 antibody and anti-CD68 antibody: CD68+stabilin-1-, CD68+stabilin-1+ and CD68-stabilin-1+. The highest levels of stabilin-1 expression and highest amount of stabilin-1+ TAM were found on stages I and IIa, suggesting that stabilin-1 is required for tumor growth at early stages of tumor progression.Our data indicate that stabilin-1 expression on TAM is necessary on the early stages of tumor growth in human cancer. Genetic knockout of stabilin-1 results in decrease in tumor growth in mouse adenocarcinoma model. In addition, tumor-associated macrophages deficient in stabilin-1 expression have significantly decreased ability for the endocytic clearance of SPARC.","title":"Stabilin-1 is expressed on tumor-associated macrophages in breast cancer and supports tumor growth in animal model of breast adenocarcinoma by clearance of SPARC","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1668"}
