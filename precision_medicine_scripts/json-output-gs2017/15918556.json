There are many differences in the genetic pathway between duct carcinogenesis and acinar carcinogensis. K-ras mutation is a key event in the early stage of pancreatic duct carcinogenesis and various gene alterations accumulate from precancerous ductal lesions until the development of carcinomas. Therefore, inhibition of K-ras gene mutation might be important for the prevention, and the combination of therapeutic agents against some target genes might be needed for therapy of ductal carcinomas.","title":"[Differential genetic pathway of duct and acinar carcinomas of the pancreas].","pubmedId":"15918556"}
