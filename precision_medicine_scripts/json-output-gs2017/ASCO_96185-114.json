Amplification of FGFR1 has been reported in lung cancer, predominantly in SCC (in up to ~ 20%) and has been considered a potential target for treatment with anti-FGFR1 agents. Different methods and cutoff levels to determine FGFR1 amplification have been reported but as yet no consensus has been reached on standard method. The aim of this study is to assess FGFR1 amplification determined by FISH analysis in a set of samples from 101SCC pts and to explore their clinical features.  Methods:  Tumor samples from 101SCC pts diagnosed at our institution from August 2007 to August 2011 were screened for FGFR1 amplification by FISH using the ZytoLight SPEC FGFR1/CEN8 probe. FGFR1 was considered FISH positive with a ratio \u003e 2.2 and FISH FGFR1 was polysomic with 3 or more signals in 30% of tumor cells, any other result was considered as negative. For exploratory analyses FGFR1 amplification was considered positive if a median of 6 or more gene copies were identified and FISH were polysomic with more than 2 gene copies but less than 6.  Results:  Pts characteristics: median age 76 yrs (range 45-80), 91% male, 33% current smokers, 67% former smokers, stage: 8% IA/ 15% IB/ 11% IIA/ 11% IIB/ 24% IIIA,  12% IIIB/ 19% IV. With a median follow up of 48 months, the median overall survival was 18 months. FISH FGFR1 was positive (ratio \u003e 2.2) in 7 (6.9%) pts: 6 were male, 4 former smokers. FISH FGFR1 was  considered negative but polysomic (3 or more signals in 30% of tumor cells) in 43/94 (45%) pts. If we use for FISH positivity a cutoff of 6 or more copies only 3 patients were considered as positive for FGFR1 amplification (2 were also FISH positive by ratio\u003e2.2). All those 5 patients considered FISH negative by gen copy number (but positive by ratio) were polysomic.  Conclusions:  In our experience FGFR1 amplification detected by FISH isrelatively uncommon in SCC, although a relevant proportion of FGFR1 FISH negative tumors had polysomy. Standarization of methods to determine FGFR1 amplification and the potential clinical significance of the presence of FGFR1 polysomy are needed.","title":"Amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 gene (FGFR1) in samples from 101 NSCLC patients (pts) with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) histology.","pubmedId":"ASCO_96185-114"}
