HT29 human colon cancer cells were treated with IGF-I for various time periods. VEGF mRNA expression increased within 2 h and peaked at 24 h. SW620 colon cancer cells exhibited a peak induction of VEGF mRNA 8 h after IGF-I treatment. IGF-I induction of VEGF was confirmed at the protein level. In experiments using transient transfection of VEGF promoter-reporter constructs into HT29 cells, IGF-I increased the activity of the VEGF promoter, and pretreatment of HT29 cells with dactinomycin abrogated the induction of VEGF mRNA by IGF-I. The half-life of VEGF mRNA was not prolonged by treatment with IGF-I. Blocking the activity of IGFBP-4 did not significantly modulate the effect of IGF-I induction of VEGF mRNA in HT29 cells. Treating cells with des-(1-3)-IGF-I (an active derivative of IGF-I that does not bind to binding proteins) had effects on VEGF mRNA expression that were similar to those of IGF-I. These findings suggest that IGF-I regulates VEGF expression in human colon cancer cells by induction of transcription of the VEGF gene. IGFBPs do not significantly affect IGF-I induction of VEGF.","title":"Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression in human colon cancer by insulin-like growth factor-I.","pubmedId":"9731515"}
