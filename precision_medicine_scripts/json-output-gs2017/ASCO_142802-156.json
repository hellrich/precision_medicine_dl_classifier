CA is associated with deleterious clinical factors such as higher grade and stage, but these reports have not shown how CA affects survival. Here we analyzed centrosome abnormalities in a cohort of 362 patients.  Methods:    A tissue microarray was constructed using triplicate punch biopsies from each patient. Centrosomes were recognized by immunohistochemistry as the overlap of pericentrin and polyglutamylated tubulin, which represent pericentriolar material (PCM) and centriole markers, respectively. We assessed centrosome number, size, shape, and clustering in at least 30 cells from 3 different regions of each patients tumor. Ploidy and CIN were assessed using 6-chromosome FISH. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards modeling. Correlations were assessed using Spearmans rank correlation coefficient.  Results:    CA was associated with worse overall survival, both all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality, as well as recurrence-free survival. Further, greater centrosome size and centrosome clustering were also associated with worse survival. CA was more pronounced in triple negative and HER2-positive subgroups, and also increased with increasing stage and histological grade. Cox proportional hazards modeling using CA, stage, grade, HER2 status, and hormone receptor status revealed that stage and hormone receptor status were the only independent predictors of survival in this cohort. Further, CA correlated with increased ploidy and chromosomal instability in these tumors. Lastly, the presence of acentriolar centrosomes was higher in cases of higher grade and stage.  Conclusions:    CA, centrosome clustering, and increased centrosome size are associated with worse survival and adverse clinical factors in breast cancer and provide important insight and possibly a direct biologic explanation for the clinical behavior of some aggressive cancers. The presence of acentriolar centrosomes was associated with higher grade and stage, which suggests that PCM fragmentation may be one cause of CA, particularly in more aggressive tumors.","title":"Centrosome amplification and prognosis in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_142802-156"}
