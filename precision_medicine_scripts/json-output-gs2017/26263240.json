A 75-year-old nonsmoker who has ALK-positive left upper bronchus adenocarcinoma-developed uveal metastases during his course of treatment.\nInitially, the patient\u0027s disseminated malignancy showed a significant response to crizotinib. However, because the bone metastases started progressing again and he developed bilateral ocular metastases, he was switched to ceritinib. After initiation of ceritinib therapy, the uveal melanomas have shown a significant decrease in thickness and no new lesions have developed.\nALK inhibitors are an effective first-line treatment in patients with ALK-positive uveal metastases secondary to ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Despite the fact that crizotinib, a first-generation ALK inhibitor, is initially effective in dealing with non-small-cell lung cancer and its metastases, resistance to it seems to develop on a regular basis. A second-generation ALK inhibitor, such as ceritinib, is also effective in overcoming this resistance in treating those with ALK-positive uveal metastases.","title":"RESPONSE OF UVEAL METASTASES TO ALK INHIBITORS IN ALK-POSITIVE NON-SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER.","pubmedId":"26263240"}
