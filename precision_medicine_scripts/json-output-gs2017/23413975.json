Resistance of tumour cells to BRAF inhibitors is reduced by the addition of an MEK inhibitor; both BRAF and MEK inhibitors have been reported to produce a variety of dermatological toxic effects. Benign naevi often harbour BRAF mutations but few reports exist that document the response of naevus cells to BRAF inhibition. We report sarcoidal-type granulomatous inflammation in two patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing treatment with combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy. This inflammation manifested in one patient as a nonspecific papular eruption; in the other, in association with clinical regression of multiple benign-appearing naevi during the course of therapy. The significance of sarcoidal-type inflammation occurring during treatment of metastatic melanoma with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is unclear. Its association with the clinical regression of benign-appearing naevi suggests a possible exaggerated inflammatory response to degenerating naevus cells in these lesions.
