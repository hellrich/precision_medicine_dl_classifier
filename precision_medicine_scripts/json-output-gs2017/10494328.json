In postmenopausal women these compounds have a favourable effect on lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the blood and bone mineral density, thereby reducing fracture risk, especially in the vertebral column. In contrast to oestrogen therapy SERMs reduce the risk of mammary carcinoma. Currently tamoxifen and raloxifene are the best known SERMs. Tamoxifen increases endometrial hyperplasia and the risk of endometrial carcinoma. Raloxifene inhibits uterine tissue proliferation and does not appear to influence the endometrium directly. Raloxifene appears to be finding a place for itself in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. At this moment it is not yet possible to foresee what the impact of SERMs will be in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer.","title":"[Selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERM\u0027s) in postmenopausal women].","pubmedId":"10494328"}
