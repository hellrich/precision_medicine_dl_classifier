The purpose of this paper is to review the prevalence of HPV in the general population (GP), in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and in cervical cancer (CCA) in the EMENA. Methods: We performed an extensive literature search (English and French literature). Data extracted included information on the method of HPV detection and HPV type-specific data, age, and the histology of the CCA when available. Results: In North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, and Egypt): The prevalence of HPV varied from 5%-12% in the low-risk GP and to 20%-49% in the high-risk GP such as prostitutes. In CIN it varied from 25%-90% (HPV 16 in 40%-100%). In CCA HPV was present in 61%-98% of cases (HPV 16 in 50%-73%). In the Middle East (Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel): The prevalence of HPV was 1.8%-13% in the low-risk GP, in CIN it was 32%-88% (HPV 16 in 10%-30%), and in CCA it varied from 45%-78% (HPV 16 in 31-67%). In the gulf countries (UAE): HPV was found in 4%-11% of the low-risk GP and 20%-30% in the high GP. HPV was present in 37% in LSIL and 67% in HSIL. In CCA, High-risk HPV was present in 87% of specimen in one study. In Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan: HPV was present in 1.5%-13% in the low-risk GP, and up to 42.9% in patients with abnormal smears. In CIN HPV was found in 50% to 100% (HPV 16 in up to 76%). In CCA, HPV was detected in 60%-100% (HPV 16 in 27%-95%). In the GP the age range was 30-50 years, while in CIN it was 30-60 years, and in CCA it was 30-70 years. The studies were varied with small number of patients and varied detection methods that are difficult to compare. Most were PCR, few were Hybrid Capture (I or II). Conclusions: Although the studies on the prevalence of HPV in the EMENA region are not abundant, but there is enough data to suggest that the prevalence of HPV is around 5%-12% in the GP, 30%-80% in CIN and 60%-90% in cervical cancer with HPV 16 as the most predominant type.","title":"Human papilloma virus (HPV): Burden of the disease in cervical cancer in the Extended Middle East and North Africa (EMENA).
