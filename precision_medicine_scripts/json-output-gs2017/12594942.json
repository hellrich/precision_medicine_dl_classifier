Surgical treatment of the primary tumor should be a mastectomy. Lymph node assessment can be done by conventional axillary node dissection or, similar to selected women with small primary tumors, by sentinel node dissection. Decisions regarding adjuvant systemic treatment should be made on the same basis as for women. Axillary node status, tumor size, hormone receptor status, and the health of the patient are important considerations in determining what adjuvant treatment is offered. The role of radiation after mastectomy in men is not well defined, but radiation should be used in patients at high risk for local recurrence. For patients with metastatic disease, treatment is based on the hormone receptor status of the tumor and is similar to the treatment for women. Because most men with breast cancer have hormone receptor-positive disease, hormonal therapy is a mainstay of treatment and tamoxifen remains the front-line drug of choice, although the latest generation of aromatase inhibitors have supplanted tamoxifen as a first-line therapy for women. As a second-line hormonal therapy for men, orchiectomy or a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist with or without an antiandrogen are reasonable alternatives. There are no reports regarding the use of the antiestrogen fulvestrant in men, but its mechanism of action and efficacy in women suggest that it will be a useful agent in hormone receptor-positive male breast cancer. For men with hormone-resistant disease, palliative chemotherapy with the same agents used for treatment of women with breast cancer is appropriate.","title":"Male breast cancer.","pubmedId":"12594942"}
