HER2 protein was determined by immunohistochemistry (clone 4B5, \u003c\u003cVentana\u003e\u003e and HER2 gene and CEP1 7 were evaluated by in situ hybridization (SISH, \u003c\u003cVentana\u003e\u003e).\nPositive and indefinite statuses were found in 59 (27%) and 47 (22%) cases, respectively; intratumor heterogeneity was detected in 32 (30%) cases. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was found in 12 (6%) cases; that of the HER2 gene along with an increase in CEPI 7 was observed in 7 (3%) cases; elevated CEP1 7 levels were seen in 19 (9%) cases. Intratumor heterogeneity of HER2 gene amplification was not found; however, one case of adenocarcinoma showed high-level HER2 gene amplification in the gland-like areas and low-level HER2 gene amplification in the solid areas. HER2-positive status and amplification were more common in adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma (p\u003c0.001). There was a moderate correlation between HER2 immunohistochemical status and amplification (r\u003d0.38; p\u003c0.001).\nThus, in non-small cell lung cancer, there is an elevated HER2 protein level and, well less frequently, altered activity in the HER2 gene (amplification) as a cause of enhanced protein synthesis.","title":"[Non-small cell lung cancer: HER2 oncogene status].","pubmedId":"26027392"}
