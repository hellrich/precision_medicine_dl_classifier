Telomerase is positive in pancreatic cancer but rarely in benign pancreatic diseases. We conducted this study to determine the usefulness of K-ras mutation and telomerase activity in pancreatic juice for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\nPancreatic juice collected during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was examined in 31 patients: 12 with pancreatic cancer, 11 with chronic pancreatitis, and 8 control patients. The K-ras gene was detected by using the restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Telomerase activity was detected by using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol.\nK-ras mutation was positive in 75% (9 of 12) of pancreatic cancers and in 27% (3 of 11) of cases of chronic pancreatitis but in none of the control patients. Telomerase activity was detected in 92% (11 of 12) of pancreatic cancers and in 18% (2 of 11) of cases of chronic pancreatitis. The diagnostic value in pancreatic cancer was comparable between K-ras mutation and telomerase when evaluated separately. However, by combining these 2 methods, the specificity rose to 100%.\nFor the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, telomerase activity in pancreatic juice may possibly be complementary to K-ras mutation because it may decrease the rate of false-positive diagnosis.","title":"Telomerase activity in pure pancreatic juice for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer may be complementary to K-ras mutation.","pubmedId":"10840305"}
