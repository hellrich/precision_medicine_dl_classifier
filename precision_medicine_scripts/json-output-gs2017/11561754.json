Its differential diagnosis and accurate subclassification are often problematic; the latter is also important with regard to appropriate treatment and prognosis. We studied a series of 23 liposarcomas that had unusual or previously undescribed features and 10 liposarcoma simulators and correlated the morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic findings. We found that use of cytogenetic-molecular genetic techniques aids in the distinction between myxoid-round cell liposarcoma and their simulators, chondroid lipoma, myxoid spindle cell-pleomorphic lipoma, cellular intramuscular myxoma, and myxofibrosarcoma. Poorly differentiated forms of round cell liposarcoma lacking morphologic evidence of lipogenesis can also be diagnosed using these techniques; however, the techniques do not aid in distinguishing low-grade myxoid from high-grade round cell liposarcomas. This study also shows that retroperitoneal liposarcomas with myxoid liposarcoma-like zones are part of the morphologic spectrum of well-differentiated-dedifferentiated liposarcoma rather than true myxoid liposarcomas. Perhaps most importantly, our results provide the first molecular genetic evidence that true mixed liposarcomas (mixed well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcoma) do indeed exist. They also unequivocally demonstrate the existence of small, round cell variants of pleomorphic liposarcoma that closely simulate myxoid-round cell liposarcoma.","title":"Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses of liposarcoma and its soft tissue simulators: recognition of new variants and differential diagnosis.","pubmedId":"11561754"}
