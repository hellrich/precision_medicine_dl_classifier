HER-2/neu gene was amplified in 22 of 46 invasive cancers (48%) and in 5 of 34 borderline cancers (15%), but none of the 20 specimens of normal ovaries showed amplification. THis difference is statistically significant (p \u003d 0.00004). The incidence of HER-2/neu amplification in late stage (III-IV, 77%) was significantly higher than that in early stage (I-II, 21%) in invasive epithelial carcinoma (p \u003d 0.0004). There was no correlation between HER-2/neu amplification and cell type or grade of tumor. In cases of ovarian tumors of borderline malignant potential, the amplification of HER-2/neu was not correlated with clinicopathologic features. Follow-up with a mean of 22 months (6-50 months) was available for 39 cases of invasive ovarian cancers and all 34 borderline ovarian cancers. The incidence of HER-2/neu amplification in the invasive cancer and borderline cancer patients who were alive with disease was 50 and 50%, and is not statistically different from that in the patients who were alive with no evidence of disease (p \u003d 0.662 and 0.345, respectively). The incidence of amplification in the invasive cancers of patients who died of the disease (86%) was higher than that in the patients who were still alive (44%), but the difference is not statistically significant (p \u003d 0.175). This study supports the association of HER-2/neu amplification with progression of invasive ovarian cancer. It also suggests that HER-2/neu amplification may be an adjunctive prognostic factor of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, shown to be associated with an unfavorable clinical course. In addition, HER-2/neu amplification occurs relatively infrequently in early invasive and borderline ovarian cancers, making it unlikely that such amplification is a general early event in ovarian carcinogenesis.","title":"Prevalence and significance of HER-2/neu amplification in epithelial ovarian cancer.","pubmedId":"8529957"}
