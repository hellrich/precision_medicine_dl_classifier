We report a case of dedifferentiated liposarcoma arising in the left thigh of an 8-year-old girl. Morphological and immunohistochemical studies revealed occasional rhabdomyoblastic differentiation in the dedifferentiated component. The identical cells were co-mingling with the well-differentiated liposarcoma component. This is the first description of such a case of liposarcoma occurring in a child.","title":"Dedifferentiated liposarcoma with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation in an 8-year-old girl.","pubmedId":"19515501"}
