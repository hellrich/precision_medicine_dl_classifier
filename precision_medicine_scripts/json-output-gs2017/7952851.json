Recent studies have begun to delineate the genetic abnormalities that underlie such tumours, and have implicated two classes of genes, oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Most investigations have focused on those astrocytomas that affect the cerebral hemispheres of adults, since these are the most common and malignant brain tumours. The high-grade astrocytomas that affect adults, such as glioblastoma multiforme, often have amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncogene and loss of a variety of chromosomal loci that probably harbour tumour suppressor genes. Of the various tumour suppressor gene loci, the p53 gene on chromosome 17p has been studied most closely and has been shown to be mutated in both low- and high-grade astrocytomas. These genetic alterations may provide a means for subdividing astrocytomas into diagnostic categories. For instance, p53 gene mutations occur more commonly in glioblastomas from young adults and women, while EGFR gene amplification is more common in glioblastomas from older adults and men. For the other primary CNS tumours, genetic studies remain in their infancy. The neurocutaneous syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2, have provided unique insights into neurological oncogenesis. The NF1 gene on chromosomes 17q and its product, neurofibromin, may be important in the formation of neurofibrosarcomas, while the NF2 gene on chromosome 22q and its product, merlin, are probably involved in the formation of schwannomas and other nervous system tumours. The further characterization of these and other neurological tumour genes will undoubtedly illuminate many other areas in neurooncology.","title":"Genetic basis of neurological tumours.","pubmedId":"7952851"}
