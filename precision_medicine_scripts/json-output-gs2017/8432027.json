It also plays an important role in the progression of human breast cancer. c-myc gene amplification may be important for cancer cell invasion, but perhaps not essential for nodal metastasis. We also provide compelling evidence that the c-myc oncogene is an estrogen target gene in hormone-responsive breast cancer. Hormonal progression of breast cancer could be brought about by the enhanced expression of the c-myc gene, with gene amplification and enhanced c-myc mRNA stability being two major mechanisms involved.","title":"c-myc oncogene expression in estrogen-dependent and -independent breast cancer.","pubmedId":"8432027"}
