Anxa4 has a potential role in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of certain cancers. Studies indicate that Anxa4 up-regulation promotes the progression of tumor and chemoresistance of colorectal cancer (CRC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), endometrial carcinoma (EC), gastric cancer (GC), chemoresistant lung cancer (LC), malignant mesothelioma (MM), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), breast cancer (BC), and laryngeal cancer. Interestingly, Anxa4 also might specifically function as a tumor suppressor for prostate cancer (PCa) and have a paradoxical role for pancreatic cancer (PCC). Differential expression of Anxa4 may distinguish major salivary gland tumor (MSGT) from thyroid cancer. In addition, its differential expression was linked to Sirt1-induced cisplatin resistance of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and miR-7-induced migration and invasion inhibition of glioma. This current review summarizes and discusses the clinical significance of Anxa4 in cancer as well as its potential mechanisms of action. It may provide new integrative understanding for future studies on the exact role of Anxa4 in cancer. ","title":"Annexin A4 and cancer.","pubmedId":"26048190"}
