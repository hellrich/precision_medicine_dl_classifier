HGF expression, EGFR T790M secondary mutation, and MET amplification were determined by immunohistochemistry, cycleave real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively.\nHigh-level HGF expression, EGFR T790M secondary mutation, and MET amplification were detected in 61, 52, and 9% of tumors with acquired resistance, respectively. High-level HGF expression was detected in 29% of tumors with intrinsic resistance (nonresponders), whereas EGFR T790M secondary mutation and MET amplification were detected in 0 and 4%, respectively. HGF expression was significantly higher in tumors with acquired resistance than in sensitive tumors (p \u003c 0.001, Student\u0027s t test). Fifty percent of tumors with acquired resistance showed simultaneous HGF expression with EGFR T790M secondary mutation and MET amplification.\nHigh-level HGF expression was detected more frequently than EGFR T790M secondary mutation or MET amplification in tumors with intrinsic and acquired EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer in Japanese patients. These observations provide a rationale for targeting HGF in EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer.","title":"Hepatocyte growth factor expression in EGFR mutant lung cancer with intrinsic and acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in a Japanese cohort.","pubmedId":"22052230"}
