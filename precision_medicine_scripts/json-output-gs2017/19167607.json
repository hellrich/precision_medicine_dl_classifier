To date, numerous oncogenes or tumor suppressors on some of these regions have been characterized. An increasing body of evidence suggests that such regions also harbor microRNA genes with crucial regulatory roles in cellular processes and disease mechanisms, including cancer. Here, we investigated 35 microRNAs localized to common genomic gain and/or loss regions in breast cancers. To examine amplification or loss of these microRNAs as a result of genomic instability, we performed semiquantitative duplex polymerase chain reaction in 20 breast cancer cell lines, 2 immortalized mammary cell lines, and 2 normal DNA controls. A comprehensive DNA fold number change data for 35 microRNA genes on chromosomal gain/loss regions are presented in breast cancer cells. A 23% (8/35) of the investigated microRNAs showed significant fold number increases (greater than fourfold) compared to GAPDH in one or more of the breast cell lines. Although no homozygous deletions were detected, fold number decreases indicating potential loss regions were observed for 26% (9/35) of the investigated microRNAs. Such fold number changes may point out some of these microRNAs as potential targets of the genomic instability regions as oncogene and tumor suppressor candidates.","title":"An investigation of microRNAs mapping to breast cancer related genomic gain and loss regions.","pubmedId":"19167607"}
