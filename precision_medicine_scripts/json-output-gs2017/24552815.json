We present evidence that at high cell density, overexpression of Pnck in HEK 293 cells inhibits serum-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/ERK2) activation. ERK1/2 inhibition is calcium-dependent and Pnck kinase activity is required for ERK1/2 inhibition, since expression of a kinase-dead (K44A) and a catalytic loop phosphorylation mutant (T171A) Pnck protein is unable to inhibit ERK1/2 activity. Ras is constitutively active at high cell density, and Pnck does not alter Ras activation, suggesting that Pnck inhibition of ERK1/2 activity is independent of Ras activity. Pnck inhibition of serum-induced ERK1/2 activity is lost in cells in which phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is suppressed, suggesting that Pnck inhibition of ERK1/2 activity is mediated by PTEN. Overexpression of protein phosphatase-active but lipid phosphatase-dead PTEN protein inhibits ERK1/2 activity in control cells and enhances Pnck-mediated ERK1/2 inhibition, suggesting that Pnck increases availability of protein phosphatase active PTEN for ERK1/2 inhibition. Pnck is a stress-responsive kinase; however, serum-induced p38 MAP kinase activity is also downregulated by Pnck in a Pnck kinase- and PTEN-dependent manner, similar to ERK1/2 inhibition. Pnck overexpression increases proliferation, which is inhibited by PTEN knockdown, implying that PTEN acts as a paradoxical promoter of proliferation in ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation-inhibited, Pnck-overexpressing cells. Overall, these data reveal a novel function of Pnck in the regulation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase activity and cell proliferation, which is mediated by paradoxical PTEN functions. The possible biological implications of these data are discussed.","title":"PTEN-mediated ERK1/2 inhibition and paradoxical cellular proliferation following Pnck overexpression.","pubmedId":"24552815"}
