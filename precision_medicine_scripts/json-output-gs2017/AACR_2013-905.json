The major targets of regorafenib are membrane-bound and intracellular kinases including RET, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2, DDR2, Trk2A, Eph2A, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E, SAPK2, PTK5, and Abl pathways. In HCC, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key transcription factor involving in cell proliferation and survival in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, Targeting STAT3 by small molecule is a promising strategy in HCC therapy. Methods: We have designed and synthesized a series of regorafenib analogues without kinase inhibitory activity. These compounds are treated with and analyzed in terms of STAT3 activity in HCC cell lines. Also, Effects of regorafenib analogues induced cell death are evaluated. Results: We demonstrate that regorafenib and its analogues repress STAT3 phosphorylation, subsequently abrogate STAT3-regulated protein, Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 and further induce apoptosis in HCC cells. Overexpression of STAT3 in PLC-5 cells attenuates apoptotic effect with regorafenib and its analogues treatment, suggesting STAT3, at least, is a major target. Interestingly, the new analugues of regorafenib are devoid of kinase inhibitory activity which implies the involvement of other regulation factors. The activity of negative regulator of STAT3, such as protein tyrosine phosphatases, is under investigation. In summary, the new analogues provide a lead for the design of a new class of agents that inhibit STAT3 along and synergize with clinical drugs in HCC.(Supported by NSC 100-2325-B-010-007)","title":"Design and synthesis of regorafenib analogues against signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-905"}
