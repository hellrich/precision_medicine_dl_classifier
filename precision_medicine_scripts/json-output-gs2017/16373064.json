Only one cycle of 5-fluorouracil had been previously administered. Computed tomography of the chest showed lesions that suggested pulmonary fibrosis. There was an unfavourable response to treatment with corticosteroids, antimicrobial and antifungical agents. Lung biopsy findings were compatible with interstitial pneumonitis. The patient died 20 days after admission due to irreversible respiratory failure. This is the first case reported in the literature of interstitial pneumonitis related to single-agent oxaliplatin administration.","title":"Interstitial pneumonitis after oxaliplatin treatment in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"16373064"}
