Of 1113 patients who underwent a curative gastrectomy, 174 had SRC (early, 120; advanced, 54) and 939 had other types of gastric carcinoma. Clinicopathological features, prognostic factors and surgical outcome in patients with SRC and non-SRC were compared.\nIn patients with early gastric cancer, age, histological type, and number and anatomical extent of lymph node metastases independently affected prognosis. Patients with SRC had a significantly better survival rate than those with non-SRC, although there was no difference in the extent or number of lymph node metastases. Mucosal tumours with a diameter of 40 mm or less and submucosal lesions with a diameter of 20 mm or less were not associated with lymph node metastasis. SRC in advanced disease was frequently poorly differentiated or scirrhous, but macroscopic appearance was not an independent prognostic factor.\nEarly SRC of the stomach is associated with a better prognosis than non-SRC. Conversely, in advanced gastric cancer histological type cannot be used to establish a definitive therapeutic strategy.","title":"Therapeutic strategy for signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach.","pubmedId":"15376179"}
