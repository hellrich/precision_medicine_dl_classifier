Additionally, we compared lumican expression with expression of Ki-67, VEGF and mutated p53 proteins, which are markers of cancer progression.\nExpression levels of lumican mRNA and protein in cancer tissue were significantly higher than those in tumor-adjacent tissue (t\u003d5.69, p\u003c0.05). The stromal expression of lumican in poorly differentiated cases was significantly higher at stage T4 than stage T2-3 (χ²\u003d21.06, p\u003c0.05); similarly, the stromal expression of lumican was significantly higher in TNM stage III-IV than in stage I-Il (χ²\u003d17.01, p\u003c0.05). Additionally, expression of Ki67 was higher in poorly differentiated cases than in highly-moderately differentiated cases (χ²\u003d13.06, p\u003c0.05). Finally, in highly-moderately differentiated samples, stromal expression of lumican was negatively correlated with expression of Ki-67, VEGF and mutated P53 (p\u003c0.05).\nLumican expression is higher in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma than in tumor-adjacent tissue, and the correlation of lumican expression with TNM stage in poorly differentiated samples, in contrast with its negative correlation with expression of Ki-67, VEGF and mutated P53 mutation in highly-moderately differentiated samples.","title":"Lumican expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22951524"}
