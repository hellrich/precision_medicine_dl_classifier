In the current multicenter joint research in Japan, we focused on the relationship between a history of colorectal cancer and its prognostic impact in patients with subsequent lung cancer.\nBetween 2000 and 2013, we designed a retrospective multicenter study at three institutes in Japan to evaluate the prognostic factors in lung cancer patients with a previous surgery for colorectal cancer.\nThe cohorts consisted of 123/4431 lung cancer patients with/without a previous history of surgery for colorectal cancer. The median follow-up period was 6.1 years after lung cancer surgery. The 5-year overall survival in lung cancer patients with/without colorectal cancer was not significantly different, regardless of the stage of lung cancer (overall: 71.3 versus 74.7%, P \u003d 0.1426; Stage I lung cancer: 83.3 versus 84.8%, P \u003d 0.3779; Stage II or more lung cancer: 47.7 versus 54.4%, P \u003d 0.1445). Based on multivariate Cox regression analysis in 4554 lung cancer patients, a past history of colorectal cancer was not a significant prognostic factor (P \u003d 0.5335). Among the 123 lung cancer patients with colorectal cancer, age and absence of adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer were significant prognostic factors based on multivariate analysis (P \u003d 0.0001 and 0.0236). Furthermore, there was no difference in the overall survival of lung cancer patients according to the stage of colorectal cancer (Stage I: 74.7%; Stage II/III: 66.5%, P \u003d 0.7239).\nA history of antecedent colorectal cancer did not contribute to the prognosis in patients with subsequent lung cancers.","title":"Prognosis of lung cancer patients with a past history of colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"25156681"}
