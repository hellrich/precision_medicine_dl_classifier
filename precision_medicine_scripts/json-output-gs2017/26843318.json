We identified five cases of malignant PT with regions identical to well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLS) of soft tissue and evaluated them for MDM2 and CDK4 gene expression and amplification using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively. Despite indistinguishable morphology all cases of malignant PT with WDLS-like liposarcomatous differentiation were negative for MDM2 and CDK4 IHC and FISH, supporting different underlying pathogenesis.
