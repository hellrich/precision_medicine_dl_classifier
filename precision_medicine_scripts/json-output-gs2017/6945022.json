A study was undertaken to ascertain whether a glycogen accumulation is reestablished in cells once the neoplastic lesion is removed by radical therapy: 425 cases of cervical cancer were investigated before and after different types of therapy. A good response to radiotherapy or surgery was associated with a progressive increase in the glycogen observed in the vaginal smears, particular in premenopausal cases; patients with a poor response to radiotherapy or chemotherapy did not exhibit glycogen accumulation in the exfoliated cells. It thus appears that glycogen is a sensitive indicator of the responsiveness of cervical cancer to treatment and hence can be of prognostic value. Such sensitivity is further reflected in the detection of recurrence of the disease after an initially good response to therapy; that indicates that glycogen accumulation can possibly serve as a useful tool in the early diagnosis of recurrence.","title":"The use of glycogen studies in the evaluation of treatment for carcinoma of the cervix uteri.","pubmedId":"6945022"}
