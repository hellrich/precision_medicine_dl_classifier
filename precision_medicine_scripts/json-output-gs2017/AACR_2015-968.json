The molecular underpinnings that drive this process are poorly characterized. Here, we implemented an integrated approach to the discovery of biologically distinct subsets of KRAS-mutant LUAC and explored their molecular vulnerabilities.MethodsOur datasets consisted of 68 KRAS-mutant tumors from TCGA, 88 additional chemo-naive KRAS-mutant LUACs (PROSPECT and Chitale datasets) and 36 platinum-refractory LUACs from the BATTLE-2 clinical trial. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) consensus clustering was applied to RNASeq data as previously described. Signature enrichment was assessed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).ResultsNMF consensus clustering identified three robust subsets of KRAS-mutant LUAC that were reproducible across diverse clinical datasets of early-stage, chemotherapy-naive and metastatic, chemo-refractory tumors. Distinct KRAS-mutant alleles were not differentially represented in the three subgroups (P \u003d 0.3). In contrast, the subgroups were dominated, respectively, by co-occurring genetic events in STK11/LKB1 (termed the KL subgroup) (P \u003d 1.03e05), TP53 (KP) (P \u003d 3.8e-06) and low expression of TTF1 coupled with frequent CDKN2A/B inactivation (KC) (P \u003d 0.004 and P \u003d 0.002).Distinct patterns of intracellular signaling were detected in the three subsets. KL tumors showed evidence of LKB1-AMPK pathway inactivation and adaptation to energetic, proteotoxic and oxidative stress, the latter exemplified by near ubiquitous inactivation of KEAP1 and up-regulation of a NRF2-driven antioxidant signature. KP tumors carried a higher somatic mutation load and were characterized by prominent inflammation and up-regulation of several immune checkpoint effector molecules, including PD-L1. KC tumors frequently displayed a GI-like differentiation program, suppression of MTORC1 signaling and elevated wild-type p53 transcriptional output.Using a large panel of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines we detected co-mutation-dependent patterns of drug sensitivity. Specifically, KL cell lines showed enhanced sensitivity to several structurally distinct HSP90 inhibitors. These results were confirmed in panels of isogenic cell lines. Mechanistically, treatment with ganetespib resulted in concurrent degradation of several molecules with established role in supporting the fitness of LKB1-deficient cells.ConclusionsOur work identifies three major subsets of KRAS-mutant LUAC - dominated by co-occurring genetic events - with distinct biology and therapeutic vulnerabilities.","title":"Co-occurring genomic alterations define major subsets of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC) with distinct biology and therapeutic vulnerabilities","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-968"}
