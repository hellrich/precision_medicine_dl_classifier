Although some studies have suggested that it is associated with a worst prognosis some have not suggest. We evaluated the effect of treatment modalities on overall survival and disease-free survival in breast cancer. Methods: One hundred and sixty two women with multifocal multicentric breast cancer diagnosed at our oncology center between January 2004 and December 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. Multifocality was defined as the presence of 2 or more foci of the tumor clearly separated in the same breast. Multicentricity was defined as the presence of 2 or more foci at different quadrants. Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Results: Median age of 162 women was 48 y  13,63 y. Eighty two of 162 patients were treated with breast-conserving surgery and 80 were treated with mastectomy. Radiotherapy was added to adjuvant therapy to patients with 4 or more positive axillary nodes and/or treated with breast conserving surgery. Three (1.8%) patients were excluded because of bilateral cancer and 1 (0.6%) was excluded because of Tx tumor. Eleven of 162 (6.7%) patients were not seen after surgery so data about adjuvant treatment was not known. Fifty of 147 patients were stage III, 68 were stage II and 30 were stage I. 27 (17.2%) patients received anthracycline based chemotherapy, 30 (20.3%) patients received hormonotherapy and 91 (56.1%) patients received taxane based chemotherapy. Trastuzumab added to the treatment at all patients, if HER2 neu-positive. Median follow up was 41  4.1 (72-9 months) months. 30 systemic diseases at 24 patients were seen on follow up. 18 patients were in taxane group, 4 patients were in anthracycline group, 2 patients were in hormonotheraphy group. Nine patients were died in taxane group, 1 died in anthracycline group and 1 died in hormonotherapy group. Conclusions: Our retrospective analysis showed worst prognosis at taxane group but; patients with positive lymph nodes and perinodal invasion gets taxane based treatments. This retrospective analysis showed that systemic recurrence and survival in multifocal breast cancer are similar with unifocal disease.","title":"Results by treatment modalities in multifocal/multicentric breast cancer: Retrospective analysis of 162 patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_86408-111"}
