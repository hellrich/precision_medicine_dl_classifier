The most common chemotherapeutic agents implicated with radiation recall phenomenon are anthracyclines and taxanes. Skin is the most common site for radiation recall. About 63% of the radiation recall events are reported to manifest as dermatitis. This finding differs from radiation recall due to Gemcitabine, in which approximately 70% cases manifested as inflammation of internal organs or tissues and 30% manifested as dermatitis. Here, we report a case of post-operative peri-ampullary carcinoma who developed radiation recall dermatitis during adjuvant chemotherapy with inj. Gemcitabine and inj. Carboplatin after concurrent chemoradiation with capecitabine.","title":"Gemcitabine-induced radiation recall phenomenon in a post-operative and post-radiotherapy case of peri-ampullary carcinoma during adjuvant chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"23174731"}
