The first was a 49-year-old male with gall bladder cancer, who was admitted to the hospital with metastatic umbilical tumor and intraabdominal dissemination. After 2 courses of treatment, the tumor was significantly decreased and the dissemination was diminished. The second was a 42-year-old female of breast cancer, involving lung, adrenal gland and bone metastasis. After 2 courses of treatment, all metastasis responded remarkably. Case 3 was a 42-year-old female with recurrent rectal cancer. Her lung metastasis completely disappeared after EAP treatment. Case 4 was a 42-year-old breast cancer patient with multiple liver metastasis, who also exhibited a remarkable response. In spite of severe side effects, EAP treatment was remarkably effective in all four cases of unresectable advanced adenocarcinoma.","title":"[Four cases of advanced adenocarcinoma showing marked response to EAP (etoposide, ADM, CDDP) treatment].","pubmedId":"8259856"}
