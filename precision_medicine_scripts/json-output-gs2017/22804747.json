DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and amplified with shifted termination assay technology, which recognizes wild-type or mutant target sequences and selectively extends detection primers with labelled nucleotides. A mutation in KRAS was found in three (11.5%) of 26 primary bladder adenocarcinomas. Two of these three cases exhibited a G13D mutation, whereas the remaining case contained a mutation in G12V. None of the ten cases of urothelial carcinoma with glandular differentiation displayed KRAS mutation. Colonic adenocarcinoma contained a KRAS mutation in 18 (33%) of 55 cases. There was no distinct difference with regard to grade, stage or outcome according to the limited clinicopathological data available. However, the two youngest patients, aged 32 and 39 years, in our study group, with a mean population age of 61 years, were found to have mutations in KRAS.\nKRAS mutations are present in a small subset of primary urinary bladder adenocarcinomas. Future clinical trials for treatment of bladder adenocarcinoma, employing targeted therapies similar to those used for treatment of colon cancer, may also benefit from the predictive implications of KRAS mutational testing.","title":"KRAS mutation is present in a small subset of primary urinary bladder adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"22804747"}
