Alternative and complementary medicine is a treatment option that patients tend to use. This study is to determine the prevalence of mental disorders among patients diagnosed with DM and HT and their use of alternative medicine methods. Materials and Methods The study was conducted in a primary care setting. The data were collected from the Family Health Center No. 4 at Î—ankaya, Ankara, Turkey. It involved patients aged between 18 and 65, who were on follow-up treatment for DM and HT. Patients accepted to participate in the study were administered the sociodemographic data form, the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) questionnaire and the alternative medicine inquiry form.\nOne hundred and sixteen patients with HT and 119 patients with DM (type 2) were recruited for the study.\nIn this study, 47.4% of HT patients and 53.8% of the DM patients were diagnosed with a PRIME-MD. The most commonly encountered disorder was mood disorders, in 37.1% of the HT patients and 45.4% of the DM patients. In this study, four HT patients (0.3%) and no DM patients stated that they resorted to complimentary medicine, which can use be used alongside conventional medical treatment and may help to feel better and cope better with any chronic condition. All four HT patients were using multivitamin combinations to support the treatment. As the alternative medicine usage was described as treatment used instead of conventional medical treatment we did not find any patient using alternative medicine.\nMental disorders may coexist with HT and DM. Some of the HT and DM patients suffering from a mental disorder seek psychiatric support, while others do not. We believe that it is important to examine patients for mental disorders, while being followed-up for a chronic disease.","title":"Mental disorders frequency alternative and complementary medicine usage among patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.","pubmedId":"25385908"}
