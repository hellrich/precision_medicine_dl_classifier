However, objective response of immunotherapies has remained less than 5%. Since suppressive immunoreactions in tumor microenvironment have been illustrated in the past decade, immunosuppressive molecules are supposed to be useful targets of antibody therapies. One of the promising antibody therapies for melanoma is ipilimumab, anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)4 antibody, which was approved by Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. in 2011. Although 10 mg/kg of ipilimumab showed 10-15% of objective response, phase 3 study of ipilimumab with gp100 vaccination or with dacarbazine showed prolonged survival. PD-1 blockade also showed more safe and great durable antitumor reactivity. Anti-CD137 agonist antibody and anti-CD40 agonist antibody are also good candidates for melanoma therapy. These immunomodulating therapies are the most promising treatment to overcome immunosuppression of melanoma.","title":"[Antibody therapies for melanoma].","pubmedId":"23259392"}
