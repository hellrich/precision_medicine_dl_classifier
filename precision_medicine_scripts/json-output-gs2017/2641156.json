A correlative cytologic and histologic study of a myxoid liposarcoma of the shoulder in a 72 year-old man and a pleomorphic liposarcoma observed in the retroperitoneum of a 84 year-old woman, are presented. A preoperative FNAB cytology performed in both cases showed necrotic material containing spindle-stellate shaped cells, interspersed in a myxoid matrix, with rare classical monovacuolated lipoblasts and fragments of plessiform vessels were seen in the first and scattered pleomorphic and multinucleated cells, with prominent nucleoli and numerous atypical mitosis in the second. A malignant mesenchimal spindle-cells tumor, with myxoid matrix and pleomorphic cells, consistent with liposarcoma, respectively were suspected. Gross and histological specimens confirmed the cytological suspect. Authors discuss main cyto-histological differential diagnoses of myxoid tumors, and point out the importance and a correct differentiation between myxoid liposarcoma and intramuscular myxoma. The cytologic appearance of pleomorphic liposarcoma is similar to histologic type and therefore the problem of a differential diagnosis with soft tissue tumors is analogous. When mono or plurivacuolated lipoblasts are absent, differential diagnosis between pleomorphic histiocytoma and liposarcoma is impossible. Nevertheless this is not a important problem at cytological level because both tumors have a had prognosis and must be treated with radical surgery. Definition of correct histologic type will be more suitable on histologic specimens.","title":"[Myxoid liposarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma: cyto-histological correlations].","pubmedId":"2641156"}
