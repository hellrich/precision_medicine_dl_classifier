In 15 of the 32 cases of ovarian carcinoma, peripheral lymphocytes were also studied. The amplification rate of C-myc, C-N-ras, C-Ki-ras and C-erbB-2 in ovarian carcinoma were 50%, 44%, 31% and 25% respectively. The amplification of C-Ki-ras and C-N-ras took place chiefly in cases of early stage and those of good differentiation. The amplification of C-N-ras was also found in cases of advanced stage. The amplifications of C-myc and C-erbB-2 were chiefly found in cases above stage III and those of poor differentiation. A total of 83% of the patients who died were found to have amplifications of more than 2 proto-oncogenes, with which the amplification of C-erbB-2 was involved.","title":"Amplifications of proto-oncogenes in ovarian carcinoma.","pubmedId":"8585978"}
