Currently, we are able to use KRAS mutational status as a guide to therapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies. Other molecular features under research include BRAF mutation, microsatellite instability, and CpG island methylation. These three molecular features are often associated with tumors that have overlapping phenotypes and can be present simultaneously in the same tumor. However, they carry different prognostic and predictive qualities, making analysis of their interaction relatively complex. Much research thus far has examined the clinical relevance of microsatellite instability in helping determine prognosis and the predictive value of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy in stages II and III colon cancers. BRAF mutation appears to be a biomarker for poor prognosis. CpG island methylation is tightly associated with microsatellite instable tumors and BRAF mutation, but its clinical utility remains uncertain. Hereby, we examine preclinical and clinical data that supports the utilization of all three phenotypes in future research applied to clinical practice.","title":"CpG Island Methylation, Microsatellite Instability, and BRAF Mutations and Their Clinical Application in the Treatment of Colon Cancer.","pubmedId":"22792460"}
