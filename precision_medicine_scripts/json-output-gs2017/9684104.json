Many of the molecular strategies that have been proposed are also being developed for other cancers. Their application to breast cancer, however, needs to address several issues specific to this disease such as the widespread nature of metastases, the indolent growth of the tumor cells, and the production by the tumor of immunosuppressive agents. Nonetheless, these approaches appear promising, particularly those that employ a combination of strategies. Gene therapies that affect the biology of breast cancer cells or regulate host immune mechanisms have been most successful and may be paired with existing therapies for breast cancer.","title":"Gene therapy for breast cancer.","pubmedId":"9684104"}
