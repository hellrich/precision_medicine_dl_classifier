The progression of the melanocyte to a malignant melanoma involves various sequential steps: development of benign naevocellular naevus, preneoplastic dysplastic naevus, primary melanoma, and metastatic melanoma. Despite these clearly defined stages, very little is known about the molecular events leading to melanoma progression. We established a human congenital naevus cell line (UISO-CMN-1). UISO-CMN-1 cells were confirmed to have melanocytic origin by S100 immunoreactivity and the presence of melanin granules and melanosomes. UISO-CMN-1 cells, even though they showed structural and numerical abnormalities in karyotype, were non-tumorigenic when transplanted into athymic mice. However, following frequent exposure to ultraviolet C radiation, UISO-CMN-1 cells acquired tumorigenic potential. Transformation of UISO-CMN-1 cells into tumorigenic cells was accompanied by induction of ganglioside-2 expression without any significant changes in cellular ganglioside-3. These transformed and non-transformed UISO-CMN-1 cell lines can serve as excellent research tools for studying the molecular changes associated with melanoma development and progression, and for identifying agents that might prevent development of malignant melanoma.","title":"In vitro transformation of human congenital naevus to malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"11828255"}
