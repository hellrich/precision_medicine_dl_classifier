Tissue microarray analysis using interphase FISH indicated that hemizygous PTEN losses were present in 42/107 (39%) of prostatic adenocarcinomas, with a homozygous PTEN deletion observed in 5/107 (5%) tumours. FISH analysis using closely linked probes centromeric and telomeric to the PTEN indicated that subband microdeletions accounted for approximately 70% genomic losses. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of PTEN genomic losses (hemizygous and homozygous deletion vs not deleted) identified subgroups with different prognosis based on their time to biochemical relapse after surgery, and demonstrated significant association between PTEN deletion and an earlier onset of disease recurrence (as determined by prostate-specific antigen levels). Homozygous PTEN deletion was associated with a much earlier onset of biochemical recurrence (P\u003d0.002). Furthermore, PTEN loss at the time of prostatectomy correlated with clinical parameters of more advanced disease, such as extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion. Collectively, our data indicates that haploinsufficiency or PTEN genomic loss is an indicator of more advanced disease at surgery, and is predictive of a shorter time to biochemical recurrence of disease.","title":"FISH analysis of 107 prostate cancers shows that PTEN genomic deletion is associated with poor clinical outcome.","pubmedId":"17700571"}
