The incidence increased steadily over time in both sexes in all socioeconomic groups. Good prognosis tumours ( \u003c 1.5 mm thick) were most common in the most affluent men and women, and over the study period the proportion of such tumours increased most in the intermediate affluence group (both sexes) and in the least affluent women. Five year disease free survival from melanoma for the sexes combined was 81% for most affluent, 77% for intermediate, and 73% for least affluent groups. Even after adjustment for known prognostic factors of tumour thickness, ulceration, age, and body site of primary melanoma, the more affluent the group, the better the survival.\nAlthough the incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma is higher among more affluent people, the prognosis is better in this group than for less affluent individuals. Early diagnosis campaigns should be targeted particularly to less affluent men and primary prevention campaigns should emphasise the greater risk in more affluent women.","title":"Incidence and thickness of primary tumours and survival of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma in relation to socioeconomic status.","pubmedId":"8620127"}
