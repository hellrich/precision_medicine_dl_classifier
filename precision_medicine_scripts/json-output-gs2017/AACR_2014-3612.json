SGC have a heterogeneously hypoxic environment which has been currently considered to be associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes cancer. Stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) form an important chemokine/receptor pair, and are supposed to be up-regulated by hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). The aim of our study was to clarify the effect of hypoxic environment on the CAF and CXCR4/SDF-1 axis in SGC.Experimental Design:Proliferation of SGC cells grown in monoculture and co-culture with CAF under hypoxia. SGC and CAF expression level of CXCR4 and SDF-1 under hypoxia were examined by RT-PCR and ELISA. Proliferation and migration of SGC cells with SDF-1 or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or conditioned medium from CAF under hypoxia, furthermore, added c-Met inhibitor or CXCR4 inhibitor.Results:The proliferation that co-culture of SGC cells with CAF was significantly increased under hypoxia. The expression level of CXCR4 mRNA was significantly increased under hypoxia in all of SGC cells. SDF-1 concentration level was significantly increased under hypoxia. The proliferation of SGC cells with SDF-1 and CAF was significantly increased. The proliferation of SGC cells with CAF was inhibited by CXCR4 inhibitor under hypoxia. The migration of SGC cells with HGF and CAF was significantly increased. The migration of SGC cells with CAF was inhibited by c-Met inhibitor.Conclusion:CAF might up-regulate the proliferation and migration of SGC cells under hypoxia, in comparison with that under normoxia. CXCR4/SDF-1 axis might play an important role for the proliferation of SGC cells under hypoxia.","title":"Effect of cancer associated fibroblast on gastric cancer cells under hypoxia","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3612"}
