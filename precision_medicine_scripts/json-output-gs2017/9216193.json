Meta-analyses of clinical trials in which cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy was compared with supportive care in patients with non-resectable non-small cell lung cancer showed that the chemotherapy reduced mortality. In the last decade, new agents, including vinorelbine, edatrexate, paclitaxel, docetaxel, irinotecan, topotecan and gemcitabine, have shown promise in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, and new agents combined with platinum compounds have reached the level of phase III testing. Randomized studies in which radiotherapy alone was compared with radiotherapy and cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in patients with stage III disease showed that combined treatment can prolong survival and improve long-term outcome in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Recently, new agents combined with radiotherapy have been tested. Regimens in which platinum compounds are combined with new agents hold promise for more successful treatment of this disease.","title":"[Chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"9216193"}
