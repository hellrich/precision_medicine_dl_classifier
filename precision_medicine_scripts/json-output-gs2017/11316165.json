One patient was treated with 5-FU alone, one with photodynamic therapy, and one patient with somatostatin analog. A total of 36 patients died, whereas four (10%) patients survived (two with surgical resection, one with orthotopic liver transplantation and RT, and one with stent placement) during a median follow-up of 5.5 months (range, 1-75 months). One patient was lost to follow-up.\nIn highly selective cases, resective surgery seems to be of benefit in PSC patients with CCA. However, these therapies are rarely applied to these patients because of the advanced nature of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Efforts should be directed at earlier identification of potential surgical candidates.","title":"Treatment of cholangiocarcinoma complicating primary sclerosing cholangitis: the Mayo Clinic experience.","pubmedId":"11316165"}
