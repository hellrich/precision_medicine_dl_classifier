VEGF is associated with neovascularization, tumor growth, and edema in meningioma. This prospective phase II study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of bevacizumab (BEV), a VEGF ligand binding monoclonal antibody, in patients with progressive benign (BM), atypical (AM), and malignant meningioma (MM) as measured by median 6-month progression free survival (PFS-6). Secondary endpoints included median progression free survival (mPFS), median overall survival (mOS), and radiographic response rate.  Methods:  Patients with histologically confirmed BM, AM, or MM with radiographic progression were eligible. There was no limit on prior therapies. BEV was administered 10 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks. After 6 months of therapy, stable patients were eligible to switch to an every 3-week schedule of BEV (15 mg/kg). Clinical examination and imaging were performed every 4 and 8 weeks respectively for the first 6 months then every 6-12 weeks. Responses were graded using the Macdonald criteria.  Results:  40 patients were treated: 15 BM, 22 AM, and 13 MM. Median KPS was 80. Median age was 54 (23-81) years. Median number of BEV infusions was 16 (2-62). Grade 3 toxicities included hypertension (10), proteinuria (2), hyponatremia (2), fatigue (1), bruising (1), nausea/vomiting (1), epistaxis (1), pancreatitis (1), perianal infection (1), ataxia (1), and thrombus/embolism (1). Grade 4 toxicities included anemia (1), wound infection (1), elevated lipase (1), and weakness (1). Best responses were stable disease (BM: 100%; AM: 85%; MM: 82%); partial response (BM: 0%; AM: 5%; MM: 0%); progressive disease (BM: 0%; AM: 10%; MM:18%). PFS-6, mPFS, and mOS were 87%, 22.5 months, 35.6 months for BM; 77%, 15.3 months, not reached for AM, and 46%, 3.7 months, 12.4 months for MM.   Conclusions:  Treatment of progressive meningioma with BEV commonly leads to disease stabilization. The results are promising compared to a contemporary meta-analysis, in which PFS6 was 29% and 27% for BM and AM/MM respectively, but require confirmation. Toxicity was minimal and expected for BEV notwithstanding prolonged drug exposure.
