Methods:  SU was administered at a starting dose of 50 mg/day on a 4-week-on, 2-week-off schedule in the TU study. Clinical outcome data (PFS and ORR, both investigator-assessed per RECIST 1.0, and OS) from the TU study were correlated with KIT/PDGFRA mutational data obtained with IRB approval in the present correlative study. Tumor tissue utilized for molecular status determination was obtained pre-IM, post-IMpre-SU, or post-SU treatment. All available data were used in all analyses regardless of time of collection. Mutational status was provided by investigators following local laboratory analyses. The primary analysis compared median PFS in pts with primary KIT exon 11 vs. exon 9 mutations using a 2-sided log-rank test. Similar methods were used for OS; ORRs were compared using a 2-sided Pearson 2 test.    Results:  Of 1124 pts in the TU study, genotyping data were available or generated for 230 (20%), all of which were included in the present study. Study population and clinical outcomes were representative of the full TU study population. Prior IM therapy was discontinued due to resistance in 92% of pts and intolerance in 8%. 197 pts (86%) had primary KIT mutations, mainly in exon 11 (62%) or exon 9 (18%). Of 101 pts with additional KIT mutation data (44%), 26 (26%) had another KIT mutation (12% in exon 13, 12% in exon 17, 1% in exon 11, and 1% classified as \"other\"). 12 pts (5%) had a primary PDGFRA mutation, including 5 (2%) in exon 18. Pts with primary KIT exon 9 mutations had better outcomes vs. those with exon 11 mutations: median PFS, 12.3 vs. 7.0 months (HR, 0.59; P\u003d0.011); median OS, 26.3 vs. 16.3 months (HR, 0.55; P\u003d0.002); ORR, 19.0% vs. 6.3% (P\u003d0.012). There were insufficient data to analyze the effects of PDGFRA or additional KITmutations.  Conclusions:  The distribution of KIT/PDGFRA mutations in IM-resistant/intolerant pts with GIST and clinical outcomes observed with SU treatment were consistent with previous reports.
