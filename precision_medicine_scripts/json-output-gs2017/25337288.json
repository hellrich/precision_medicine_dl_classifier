Tumor markers, including CA199 and AFP, were also evaluated.\nPET/CT imaging showed a soft tissue mass with indistinct boundaries in the head of the pancreas with a maximum SUV of 4.39. A less dense shadow was also found in the left lobe of the liver with an indistinct boundary and a maximum SUV of 4.13. Enhanced CT revealed an enhancing mass in the head of the pancreas on arterial phase imaging as well as a mildly enhancing focus in the left lobe of the liver. The patient was diagnosed with a space-occupying lesion of the uncinate process of the pancreas suggestive of pancreatic cancer with metastasis to the liver. However, serum tumor markers were normal. Postoperative pathology was consistent with chronic pancreatitis and old hepatic schistosomiasis associated with granulomatous inflammation of the liver.\nThis case of mass-forming pancreatitis and granulomatous inflammation in old hepatic schistosomiasis mimicked metastatic pancreatic cancer on PET/CT. Such false positive lesions have not been reported before, and further exploration and investigation are needed.","title":"F-18 FDG hypermetabolism in mass-forming focal pancreatitis and old hepatic schistosomiasis with granulomatous inflammation misdiagnosed by PET/CT imaging.","pubmedId":"25337288"}
