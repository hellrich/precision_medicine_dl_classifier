It involves scoring a group of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the maximum possible score being 84. In systemic LE, the mid-point is between 9 and 12. We applied SLAM to 176 patients with cutaneous LE. Ninety-seven had localized discoid LE (L-DLE), 59 had disseminated discoid LE (D-DLE) and 20 had subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE). Eighty-five patients had low activity disease (0-4 points), 72 mildly active disease (5-9 points), 15 moderately active disease (10-14 points) and only four had very active disease (\u003e/\u003d 15 points). The most frequent lesions in patients who scored more than 10 points were photosensitivity, cicatricial alopecia, Raynaud\u0027s phenomenon and oral ulcers. Fifty patients were followed up for more than 5 years (mean follow-up 9 years). Nine of these had an increased SLAM score. Seven had L-DLE, one D-DLE and one SCLE. Seven of the 50 patients had photosensitivity, five cicatricial alopecia, five non-cicatricial alopecia, two Raynaud\u0027s phenomenon and two oral ulcers. Three patients who started with L-DLE evolved to D-DLE. The SLAM system is useful in the monitoring of disease activity in patients with cutaneous LE. Over time, even L-DLE patients may develop active disease. Photosensitivity, alopecia, oral ulcers and Raynaud\u0027s phenomenon seem to herald a worse prognosis.","title":"Measuring the activity of the disease in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus.","pubmedId":"10735950"}
