Thus far there is little information on p53 mutations in cancers of factory workers with a history of carcinogen exposure in the workplace. Occupational exposure to vinyl chloride causes liver angiosarcomas (ASL) and also increases the risk of several other cancers. Loss of p53 function in osteo- and fibrosarcomas can occur by two different mechanisms, p53 mutation and amplification of the MDM2 gene. We examined tumors from five vinyl chloride-exposed patients, four with ASL and one with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for evidence of MDM2 proto-oncogene amplification or p53 mutation in exons 5-8. Amplification of MDM2 was not found, but in two of the angiosarcomas an A:T to T:A missense mutation was detected. p53 sequence analysis of vinyl chloride associated cancers may provide valuable information on the relationship between carcinogen exposure and DNA damage in cancer-related genes.","title":"p53 mutations at A:T base pairs in angiosarcomas of vinyl chloride-exposed factory workers.","pubmedId":"8293534"}
