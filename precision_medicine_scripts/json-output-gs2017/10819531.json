We will discuss the current state of knowledge about the function of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and summarize the cancer risks in women carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. We review the evidence for gene-gene and gene-environment interaction in modifying that risk, and discuss the contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and other high penetrance genes to both inherited and sporadic breast cancer.","title":"The genetics of inherited breast cancer.","pubmedId":"10819531"}
