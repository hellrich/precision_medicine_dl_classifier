The crucial etiologic factors involved in the development of cervical carcinoma include infection with papillomavirus, and the structural or functional mutation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The abnormal change of octamer transcription factor 1 (OCT1) is associated with tumor progression and a poor patient survival rate. However, little is known regarding the effect of OCT1 in cervical cancer. In the present study, flow cytometry, western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were peformed to identify differentially expressed OCT1 in cervical cancer tissue and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The normalized OCT1 gene expression in cervical cancer was 5.98 times higher compared with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Western blot analysis and flow cytometry assessed the levels of OCT1 protein. The results of these two differential techniques showed that the protein expression level of OCT1 was greater in cervical cancer tissues, which corresponded with the qPCR results. Finally, as OCT1 is a potential target gene for microRNA (miR)-1467, -1185, -4493 and -3919, their expression levels were analyzed in cervical cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues; they were downregulated by ~45% in the cervical cancer samples. The results of the present study showed that OCT1 is highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues and indicated that OCT-1 may be significant in cervical cancer.","title":"High expression of octamer transcription factor 1 in cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"24932254"}
