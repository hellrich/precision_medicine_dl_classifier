Endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a hypo-echoic, low-density mass surrounding the middle esophagus. Bronchofiberscopy and gastrofiberscopy showed compression from the outside of bronchus and esophagus. No ulcer formation was found. Transbronchial aspiration biopsy and esophageal biopsy showed no malignancy. After 14 cm thoractomy, extirpation of the tumor was performed. The solid tumor was 10.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm in dimension, and the cut surface of the tumor was light yellow. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for c-kit, SMA, CD34, and S-100. Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), combined smooth muscle-neural type. A postoperative upper gastrointestinal tract barium study showed no stenosis. She is doing well without evidence of tumor recurrence at 12 months postoperatively. Although GIST is the most common mensenchymal tumor of the human gastrointestinal tract, this case is reported because the GIST arising from the middle esophagus is very rare.","title":"[Esophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumor surrounding the middle esophagus with dysphagia for 8 years; report of a case].","pubmedId":"15609668"}
