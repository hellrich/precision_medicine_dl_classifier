There are large variations in the age of onset, progression and prognosis. Symptoms are often manifested early in childhood. Characteristics which the two main forms NF1 and NF2 have in common are a positive family history, characteristic skin alterations, such as caf√© au lait macules, axillary or inguinal freckling and neural tumors such as neurofibroma and optic glioma (NF1) as well as (bilateral) vestibular schwannomas (NF2). An interdisciplinary cooperation is necessary for the diagnostics and therapy. ","title":"[Eye involvement in neurofibromatosis].","pubmedId":"27142037"}
