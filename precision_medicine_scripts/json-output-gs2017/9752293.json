In this review, we report and comment new data obtained from mice knockouted for p19ARF without interfering with the expression of p16INK4a. This results in the rapid occurrence of a spectrum of tumors. These data establish that p19ARF is a genuine tumor suppressor protein and raise the questions of the relationship between the two proteins and their respective importance in malignancies.","title":"[Alternative protein p19ARF: a genuine tumor suppressor gene].","pubmedId":"9752293"}
