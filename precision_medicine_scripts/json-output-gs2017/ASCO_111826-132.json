Amplification of FGFR2 is detected in up to 10% of oesophagogastric cancers where it is associated with poor prognosis.   FGFR1 amplification has also been demonstrated in 10% of breast cancers, is more common in luminal B ER positive tumors, and is also associated with inferior survival outcomes.  Finally, FGFR1 amplification has been described in up to 22% of squamous cell lung cancers.  AZD4547 is a potent and selective inhibitor of FGFR-1, 2 and 3 receptor tyrosine kinases.   Preclinically,  AZD4547 potently inhibits growth in FGFR amplified gastric and lung cancer cell lines and induces dose dependent  tumor growth inhibition and regression in FGFR amplified tumour xenograft and patient derived explant models.    Methods:   This is an open label, phase II non-randomised multi-centre study to assess the efficacy of AZD4547 monotherapy and resulting molecular changes in serial biopsies in pts with previously treated FGFR1 amplified advanced breast cancer, FGFR2 amplified advanced oesophagogastric cancer, or FGFR1 amplified advanced squamous lung cancer.  Eligibility include centrally verified FGFR amplified tumour (ratio \u003e2.2), PS\u003d0-2, ability to comply with the collection of tumor biopsies (mandatory at baseline and on days 10-14), calcium and phosphate within normal limits, measurable disease (RECIST 1.1), and no history of significant eye disease. Pts may be prescreened for FGFR amplification on archival tissue while undergoing first line or adjuvant chemotherapy.   Sixteen pts will be enrolled per cohort.  All pts will receive AZD4547 80mg bd on a two week on, one week off schedule.  The primary endpoint  is correlation between change in pERK in pretreatment and day 10-14 biopsy and change in tumour diameter on week 8 CT.  Secondary endpoints include ORR, DCR and PFS.  Multiple exploratory translational endpoints are also planned.    The study is currently open at the Royal Marsden Hospital and will open at 15 selected UK cancer centres.  This study is sponsored by the Royal Marsden Hospital, funded by AstraZeneca and has been adopted to the UK National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) portfolio.
