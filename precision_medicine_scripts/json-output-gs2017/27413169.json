Moreover, treatment with autophagy-inducing antioxidant drug, cysteamine significantly (p\u003c0.001) decreased CSE/CS-induced aggresome-bodies. We also found a significant (p\u003c0.001) increase in levels of aggresome-bodies in the lungs of smokers and COPD-subjects in comparison to non-smoker controls. Furthermore, the presence and levels of aggresome-bodies statistically correlated with severity of emphysema and alveolar senescence. In addition to CS exposure, lungs from old mice also showed accumulation of aggresome-bodies, suggesting this as a common mechanism to initiate cellular senescence and emphysema. Additionally, Beas2b cells and murine lungs exposed to CSE/CS showed cellular apoptosis and senescence, which were both controlled by cysteamine treatment. In parallel, we evaluated the impact of CS on pulmonary exacerbation, using mice exposed to CS and/or infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), and confirmed cysteamine\u0027s potential as an autophagy-inducing antibacterial drug, based on its ability to control CS-induced pulmonary exacerbation (Pa-bacterial counts) and resulting inflammation.\nCS induced autophagy-impairment accelerates lung aging, COPD-emphysema exacerbations and pathogenesis.","title":"Cigarette smoke induced autophagy-impairment accelerates lung aging, COPD-emphysema exacerbations and pathogenesis.","pubmedId":"27413169"}
