For example, several chromosomal loci possibly harboring predisposing or somatically mutated genes have been suggested. Still, we lack the comprehensive molecular model for the development and progression of prostate cancer. Only a few genes have been found to be aberrant in a significant proportion of prostate cancer. These include GSTP1, PTEN, TP53, and AR. Thus, they are natural targets for new treatment strategies.","title":"Molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"15149739"}
