Patients with breast cancer NED were followed for tumor recurrence or death during a median of 12.9 months (range 1 to 25 months). CA 15-3 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were compared in the same breast cancer NED patient population. Elevated CA 15-3 levels (greater than 40 U/ml) were observed in 38 of 1220 patients with benign diseases (3.1%) and in 25 of 350 breast cancer NED patients (7.1%). Elevations of CEA (greater than 5 ng/ml) were observed in 23 patients with breast cancer NED (6.5%). Benign diseases that produced significant elevations of CA 15-3 were chronic hepatitis (42.9%), liver cirrhosis (13.3%), sarcoidosis (16.7%), tuberculosis (9.7%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (6.7%). In breast cancer NED, initial elevations of CA 15-3 were observed in 12 of the 297 patients that remained free of disease during the follow-up, and in 13 of the 40 patients that relapsed (4.0% vs. 32.5%, p less than 0.001). Initial CEA levels were elevated in 16 patients that remained NED and in 7 patients that relapsed (5.3% vs. 17.5%, p less than 0.001). Serial determinations of CA 15-3 in patients continuously NED showed persistent elevations in 4 cases. Three of these exhibited concomitant benign diseases. In relapsing patients, serial tumor marker determinations showed that elevations of CA 15-3 before any other clinical evidence of recurrence occurred significantly more frequently than elevations of CEA (45% vs. 25%, p less than 0.001). Overall, two or more serial elevated values of CA 15-3 were observed in 7 cases, and 6 of them (85%) eventually relapsed. Median survival from study entry was 18.3 months in patients with breast cancer NED that had initial elevated CA 15-3, compared to 25+ months in those with negative CA 15-3 (p less than 0.0001). We conclude that circulating levels of CA 15-3 antigen can be elevated in some patients with non-malignant diseases, and that serial determinations of CA 15-3 may be useful in the postsurgical follow-up of patients with breast cancer when specific types of benign diseases that may cause elevations of the antigen are excluded. Additionally, CA 15-3 is more sensitive than CEA in the early diagnosis of breast cancer recurrences, and the simultaneous assay of CEA does not add information to that of CA 15-3 alone.","title":"Circulating CA 15-3 levels in the postsurgical follow-up of breast cancer patients and in non-malignant diseases.","pubmedId":"2730960"}
