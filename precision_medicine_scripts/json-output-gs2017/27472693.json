Crizotinib, a novel ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has already shown an impressive single-agent activity in ALK positive lung cancer.\nTo summarize the case of clinical data and treatment of a 33-year-old woman with pelvic adnexal metastasis NSCLC.\nHistological examination of the tumors showed lung adenocarcinoma. The right lung biopsy tissue and left adnexal mass biopsy tissue both revealed the presence of an ALK rearrangement by Ventana (D5F3) ALK immunohistochemistry assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Roche, Inc., Tuscon, AZ). The patient experienced a remarkable tumor response to crizotinib treatment.\nAlthough the adnexal location is an uncommon metastasis site from lung cancer, oncologists should be aware of the possibility of such metastasis for female patients with ALK rearrangement NSCLC. Considering this remarkable response, we conclude that the presence of adnexal metastasis in NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangement should be attentive.","title":"Response to crizotinib in a lung adenocarcinoma patient harboring EML4-ALK translocation with adnexal metastasis: A Case Report.","pubmedId":"27472693"}
