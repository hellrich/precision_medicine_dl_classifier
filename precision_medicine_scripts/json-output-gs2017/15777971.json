In 58 of 105 patients with metastatic mediastinal lymph node disease the extent of therapy-induced tumor regression could be established.\nConcerning HER2/neu expression, 16 lymph node biopsies (15.2%) showed 1+, 2+, or 3+ results. Five of these cases revealed amplification in FISH analysis (4.8%). In 44 corresponding resection specimens, Hercep-Test showed 1+, 2+, or 3+ results in 13 tumors (29.5%). Two of these patients revealed HER2/neu amplification in FISH analysis (4.5%). In patients with HER2/neu expressing tumors a trend towards a less extensive therapy-induced tumor regression could be demonstrated. When comparing pre-therapy and post-surgical results, there was a weak trend towards a selection of HER2/neu expressing tumor tissue in the course of neoadjuvant therapy.\nOnly a limited subcollective of locally advanced NSCLC meets the biological requirements for anti-HER2/neu therapy. HER2/neu positive tumors appeared to be relatively resistant to chemotherapy and radiation treatment, none of these cases having a pathological complete or at least subtotal response in the corresponding resection specimens. This observation requires confirmation in large randomized controlled studies.","title":"HER2/neu expression and amplification in non-small cell lung cancer prior to and after neoadjuvant therapy.","pubmedId":"15777971"}
