It is difficult to expect early diagnosis or improvement in prognosis due to lack of specific early symptoms and effective diagnostic methods. Whereas cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is a rare type of pancreatic tumor, surgical resection provides good prognosis because of its low possibility of local invasion or distant metastasis. In case of pancreatic cystic tumor, radiologic differentiation between benign and malignant lesions is crucial for the selection of appropriate treatment and the prediction of prognosis. And ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas presenting in cystic form is an uncommon type of cystic tumor, making it extremely rare among all pancreatic malignancies. We report two cases of atypical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma presenting as solid pseudopapillary tumor and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, respectively.","title":"[Two cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, manifested as solid pseudopapillary tumor and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm].","pubmedId":"18349578"}
