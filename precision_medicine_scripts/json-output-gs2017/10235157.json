The corresponding rates for renal pelvis cancer were 1.5, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.5 per 100000 person-years. Renal cell cancer incidence rates increased steadily between 1975 and 1995, by 2.3% annually among white men, 3.1 % among white women, 3.9% among black men, and 4.3% among black women. Increases were greatest for localized tumors but were also seen for more advanced and unstaged tumors. In contrast, the incidence rates for renal pelvis cancer declined among white men and remained stable among white women and blacks. Although 5-year relative survival rates for patients with renal cell cancer improved among whites but not among blacks, kidney cancer mortality rates increased in all race and sex groups.\nIncreasing detection of presymptomatic tumors by imaging procedures, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, does not fully explain the upward incidence trends of renal cell carcinoma. Other factors may be contributing to the rapidly increasing incidence of renal cell cancer in the United States, particularly among blacks.","title":"Rising incidence of renal cell cancer in the United States.","pubmedId":"10235157"}
