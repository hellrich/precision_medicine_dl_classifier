The discriminative clinical and pathological features of lung cancers with EGFR mutations have been intensively studied, and the predictive role of an EGFR mutation for treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) is well established. However, controversial issues remain regarding the clinical and therapeutic implications of EGFR mutations in lung cancers. These include the prognostic impact of the EGFR mutation, its predictive implication for successful treatment with anticancer agents other than EGFR-TKIs, appropriate cytotoxic agents for lung cancers with this mutation, and the chemosensitivity of EGFR-mutation-positive lung cancers after acquisition of resistance to EGFR-TKIs. In this review, we discuss these unanswered but important questions, referring to in vitro studies, basic research, retrospective analyses, and the results of phase III clinical trials.
