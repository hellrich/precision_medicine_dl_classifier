The association between BRCA2 Arg372His polymorphism and ovarian cancer susceptibility was calculated using pooled odds ratios (ORs) appropriately derived from fixed effects models.\nThere were no significant associations between BRCA2 Arg372His polymorphisms and ovarian cancer risk in overall comparisons in all genetic models (HH vs NN: OR, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.96-1.18; P \u003d 0.25; NH vs NN: OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.07; P \u003d 0.6; NH + HH vs NN: OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.98-1.04; P \u003d 0.42; HH vs NN + NH: OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95-1.17; P \u003d 0.29).\nThis meta-analysis indicates that the BRCA2 Arg372His polymorphism is not associated with ovarian cancer risk for whites. Asian and African populations should be further studied.","title":"Analyze Association of BRCA2 Arg372His Polymorphism With Ovarian Cancer Risk.","pubmedId":"26111274"}
