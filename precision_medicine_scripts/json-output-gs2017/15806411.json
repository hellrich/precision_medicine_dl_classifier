Longer lasting arterial hypertension leads to hypertension-specific organ manifestations summarized as \"hypertensive heart disease\". Hypertensive heart disease comprise the manifestation of stenosis in epicardial arteries, hypertensive microvascular disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic drive and degeneration of aortic valve. Diastolic dysfunction and reduced coronary flow reserve can be evaluated as early markers of hypertensive heart disease. These alterations lead to the major clinical manifestations of hypertensive heart disease that are symptoms of reduced coronary insufficiency with typical angina pectoris, but also of symptoms of heart failure (systolic and diastolic dysfunction) and arrhythmia. Different non-invasive and invasive procedures are available for screening and follow-up of patients with hypertensive heart disease. Primary therapeutic target is, apart from lowering blood pressure, to reverse cardiac manifestations of arterial hypertension using specific therapeutic algorithms.","title":"[Cardiovascular end organ impairment due to hypertension].","pubmedId":"15806411"}
