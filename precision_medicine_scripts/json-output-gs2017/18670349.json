Much of the literature pertains to ampullary adenomas and those associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). In this study, we evaluated the molecular features of a series of sporadic duodenal adenomas (n\u003d22) that developed distal to the ampulla, and compared them with the features of sporadic ampullary adenomas (n\u003d9) and FAP-related polyps (n\u003d12). Using a combination of immunohistochemical studies [cytokeratins 7 and 20, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, p53, MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6, and O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT)], DNA sequencing [beta-catenin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), p53, KRAS, and BRAF], and a polymerase chain reaction-based microsatellite instability assay; we assessed each case for abnormalities in the Wnt signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and DNA repair mechanisms. Wnt signaling pathway abnormalities occurred in sporadic, nonampullary (82%), and ampullary (77%) adenomas at comparable rates, usually reflecting nuclear beta-catenin immunostaining (64% and 44%, respectively), and APC rather than beta-catenin, mutations. KRAS mutations were infrequent in sporadic, nonampullary adenomas (18%), and FAP-related adenomas (9%); moderately frequent in ampullary adenomas (44%); and none of the cases harbored BRAF mutations. Only 4 (13%) sporadic adenomas showed nuclear p53 staining, but no p53 mutations were detected in exons 5 to 8. Loss of O-methylguanine methyltransferase immunostaining was identified in 1 sporadic, nonampullary adenoma, and none of the polyps in any group showed loss of MLH-1, MSH-2, or MSH-6 staining, or high-frequency microsatellite instability. We conclude that sporadic and FAP-related adenomas show similar molecular features, regardless of their anatomic location. Similar to colorectal adenomas, they harbor APC and KRAS mutations; but BRAF mutations, p53 alterations, and DNA mismatch repair abnormalities are rare.","title":"Immunohistochemical and molecular features of sporadic and FAP-associated duodenal adenomas of the ampullary and nonampullary mucosa.","pubmedId":"18670349"}
