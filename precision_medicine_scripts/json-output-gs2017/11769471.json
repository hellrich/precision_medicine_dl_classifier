In many developed countries prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men, and seems to overtake lung cancer as major cause of cancer mortality. In Japan mortality of the prostate cancer is relatively low, but future incidence and mortality of the prostate cancer will be dramatically increased. Risk factors of the prostate cancer were well known as Western-type lifestyle and diet. Carcinoma of the prostate are detected early by prostatic specific antigen and systematic trans-rectal ultrasonography guided prostatic needle biopsy. Once prostate cancer has been diagnosed in a patient, histologically graded, and staged as accurately as possible, clinicians are duty bound to offer the best advice about treatment options, even though the risks and benefits of competing therapies. Radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy are known as treatment of localized prostate cancer, antiandrogen therapy is known as treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Alternative approaches utilizing, for example microable inhibitors, inhibitor of growth factors and gene therapy also hold exciting promise.","title":"[Prostate cancer].","pubmedId":"11769471"}
