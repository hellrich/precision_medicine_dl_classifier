The level of women\u0027s knowledge about cervical cancer is not well documented in Ethiopia. The current study sought to assess women\u0027s knowledge about cervical cancer and associated factors.\nA community based cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of 620 women aged 15-49 years residing in Dessie town, Northeast Ethiopia. Respondents were selected using a multistage sampling technique. The women were interviewed at home by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire on cervical cancer knowledge. Knowledge about cervical cancer was measured using an eight item instrument. The maximum possible score was 8; those scoring 5 or more were categorized as having \"sufficient\" knowledge. Binary and multiple logistic regressions were employed to determine factors associated with knowledge about cervical cancer.\nA total of 51% of the participants had sufficient knowledge about cervical cancer. After adjusting for covariates, having sufficient knowledge about cervical cancer was positively associated with better educational level and income. Women with primary education (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 3.4; 95% CI: 2.2-5.1) and those who had secondary and above education (AOR: 8.7; 95% CI: 5.5-13.7) were more likely to have sufficient knowledge about cervical cancer compared to those who had no formal education. Furthermore, women earning an average household monthly income above 1500 Ethiopian birr (ETB) (~75 U.S. dollars) were more likely to have sufficient knowledge (AOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.3-3.9) than women with an average household monthly income less than 500 ETB (~25 U.S. dollars).\nThis study shows a suboptimal knowledge about cervical cancer regarding its risk factors, signs and symptoms, prevention and treatment among women in the study site. The level of education and economic status were found to be important determinants for knowledge about cervical cancer. Prevention programs should focus cervical cancer educational resources on women with less education and women with lower economic status groups.","title":"Knowledge about Cervical Cancer and Associated Factors among 15-49 Year Old Women in Dessie Town, Northeast Ethiopia.","pubmedId":"27690311"}
