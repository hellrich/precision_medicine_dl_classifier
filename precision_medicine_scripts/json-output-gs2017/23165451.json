This study investigated potential underlying causes of this difficulty.\nA total of 219 EP participants were compared with 153 term-born control children at 11 y of age. All children were assessed by a psychologist on a battery of standardized cognitive tests and a number estimation test assessing children\u0027s numerical representations.\nEP children underperformed in all tests in comparison with the term controls (the majority of Ps \u003c 0.001). Different underlying relationships between performance on the number estimation test and mathematical achievement were found in EP as compared with control children. That is, even after controlling for cognitive ability, a relationship between number representations and mathematical performance persisted for EP children only (EP: r \u003d 0.346, n \u003d 186, P \u003c 0.001; control: r \u003d 0.095, n \u003d 146, P \u003d 0.256).\nInterventions for EP children may target improving children\u0027s numerical representations in order to subsequently remediate their mathematical skills.","title":"Mathematics difficulties in extremely preterm children: evidence of a specific deficit in basic mathematics processing.","pubmedId":"23165451"}
