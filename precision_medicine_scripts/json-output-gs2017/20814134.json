Majority of EXTT are benign; lipoma being the commonest. Most of the malignant tumors are solid and have nonspecific features on ultrasonography (US). Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more helpful. The authors report a rare case of liposarcoma of scrotum that was suspected on ultrasonography and computed tomography and confirmed on histopathology.","title":"Liposarcoma scroti: A rare tumor.","pubmedId":"20814134"}
