However, the proportion of life that survivors spend in good health has never been assessed. Methods: Using a population-based cancer registry database, life expectancy for colorectal cancer survivors diagnosed in 2000-2006 followed until 2007 was calculated. We used the Sullivan method to calculate healthy life expectancy (HLE) and disability- free life expectancy (DFLE) using self-reported health and functional status from a random sample of colorectal cancer survivors. Results: On average a 50-year old colorectal cancer survivor may enjoy 75%-77% of his/her remaining life in good health or without disability. Survivors with stage I-III have a similar proportion of remaining life in good health ranging from 74%-84%, whereas survivors of stage IV colorectal cancer spent less than half of their remaining life in good health or without disability. Female survivors were disadvantaged in HLE and DFLE as compared to males especially among the oldest old (proportion of males\u0027 HLE at age 85: 69% vs. female\u0027s: 59%), the lowest socioeconomic class (proportion of males\u0027 HLE: 65% vs. females: 55%) and those with one or more comorbidities at time of diagnosis (proportion of males\u0027 HLE: 70% vs. females\u0027: 63%). There were no difference in HLE and DFLE by treatments (proportion of HLE for patients who had surgery only, surgery with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and surgery with chemotherapy was  78%) and subsites of colorectal cancer (proportion of HLE for colon or rectal cancer was  77%). Conclusions: Most patients with colorectal cancer may expect to spend a large amount of their life in good health and without daily activity limitation. The high proportion of unhealthy years or years with disability among the oldest old and those with advanced cancer suggests the need for better assistance in daily functioning for these groups and better palliative care.","title":"Healthy life expectancy of colorectal cancer survivors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_48881-74"}
