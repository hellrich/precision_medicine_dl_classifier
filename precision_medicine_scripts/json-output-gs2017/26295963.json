CIMAvax-EGF is a therapeutic cancer vaccine composed by recombinant EGF conjugated to a carrier protein and emulsified in Montanide ISA51. Vaccination induces antibodies against self-EGF that block EGF-EGFR interaction and inhibit EGFR phosphorylation. Five clinical trials were conducted to optimize vaccine formulation and schedule. Then, two randomized studies were completed in advanced NSCLC, where CIMAvax-EGF was administered after chemotherapy, as \u0027switch maintenance\u0027. The vaccine was very well tolerated and the most frequent adverse events consisted of grade 1/2 injection site reactions, fever, headache, vomiting and chills. CIMAvax was immunogenic and EGF concentration was reduced after vaccination. Subjects receiving a minimum of 4 vaccine doses had a significant survival advantage. NSCLC patients with high EGF concentration at baseline had the largest benefit, comparable with best maintenance therapies.
