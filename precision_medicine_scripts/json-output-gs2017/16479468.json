The results of an online registry are presented here.\nData from consecutive screening colonoscopies in the practices of the 280 participating gastroenterologists, performed in asymptomatic subjects, were collected in an online registry. Number and histology of colorectal polyps and carcinomas, complication rates of colonoscopy and polypectomy were registered. Advanced adenoma was defined as an adenoma \u003e10 mm in diameter, with villous or tubulovillous histology, or presence of high-grade dysplasia.\nA total of 109989 colonoscopies (43% in males) were evaluated from October 2003 to July 2005. Tubular and villous adenomas were found in 16.2% and 3.8%, respectively, whereas invasive cancers were diagnosed in 0.7%. Advanced adenomas amounted to 6.1%.The majority of carcinomas were detected in early stages (UICC stages I and II in 48 and 22 %, respectively). -In most of the polyps immediate polypectomy was carried out. The complication rate was low and no deaths were observed: cardiopulmonary complications occurred in 0.10% of the colonoscopies, bleeding in 0.79% of polypectomies most of which were managed endoscopically (surgery in 0.04% of polypectomies). Perforation occurred in 0.02% of the colonoscopies and 0.10% of polypectomies.\nNeoplasias of the colon were detected in about 20% of persons who had taken part in a colonoscopy screening programme: most of the lesions were immediately removed by polypectomy. The high rate of early stages of colorectal cancers detected by screening colonoscopy is an indirect indicator of mortality reduction. In Germany screening colonoscopy has a low risk.","title":"[Results of coloscopy screening in 2005--an Internet-based documentation].","pubmedId":"16479468"}
