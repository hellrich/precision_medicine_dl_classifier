Patients received imatinib with dose escalation to 600 mg/d, and further dose escalation to 800 mg/d if imatinib 600 mg/d failed. Progression-free survival, overall survival, clinical efficacy, c-kit/PDGFRA genotype and safety were evaluated.\n52 patients were enrolled in this study. For the 47 evaluable patients receiving imatinib (600 mg/d), the disease control rate was 40.4%, and the median progression-free survival for all patients was 17 wk (95% CI: 3.9-30.1). The median overall survival after dose escalation was 81 wk (95% CI: 36.2-125.8). Adverse events, mainly edema, fatigue, granulocytopenia and skin rash were tolerable. However, further dose escalation (800 mg/d) in 14 cases was ineffective, with disease progression and severe adverse events. Among 30 cases examined for gene mutations, patients with exon 9 mutations experienced a better progression-free survival of 47 wk.\nImatinib dose escalation to 600 mg/d is more appropriate for Chinese patients and may achieve further survival benefit.","title":"Efficacy of imatinib dose escalation in Chinese gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients.","pubmedId":"22363143"}
