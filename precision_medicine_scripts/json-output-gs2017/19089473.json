We report the clinical course of a 7-year-old girl with CIPA and proven NTRK1 mutation. In addition to recurrent dislocation of the left hip joint and avascular necrosis of the left talus, the patient also presented with recurrent infections secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia, a feature not previously known to be associated with CIPA. The patient was treated with regular administration of intravenous immunoglobulins. Conservative treatment of the recurrent left hip dislocation by cast immobilization and bracing was implemented to stabilize the joint. The implication of the immune system of the reported patient broadens the clinical phenotype associated with NTRK1 mutations.","title":"Humoral immunodeficiency in congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.","pubmedId":"19089473"}
