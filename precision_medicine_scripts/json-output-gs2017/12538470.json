P7 was observed in malignant cells but not in other types of cells in the breast tissue. Western blot analysis confirmed the 7 kDa polypeptide in p7-positive breast carcinomas identified by immunohistochemistry. P7 expression was significantly associated with breast cancers having distant metastasis and/or local recurrence (P \u003d 0.027, Fisher\u0027s exact test). In addition, p7 expression was significantly increased in post-treatment breast cancer biopsy specimens compared with pretreatment breast cancer biopsy specimens in patients with locally advanced breast cancer after 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy and radiation therapy [2 of 15 (13%) pretreatment breast cancers compared with 8 of 15 (53%) post-treatment breast cancers; P \u003d 0.016, McNemar\u0027s test].\nThese findings demonstrate that expression of p7 is associated with malignant tumor cells in primary breast cancers, especially those showing recurrent or metastatic disease. Its specific association with the malignant phenotype suggests it may have potential for novel target-based therapies. The markedly increased expression in patients with locally advanced disease after neoadjuvant therapy suggests a role for p7 in treatment outcome.","title":"P7 antigen expression in human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"12538470"}
