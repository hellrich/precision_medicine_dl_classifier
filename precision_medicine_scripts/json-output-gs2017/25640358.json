The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the erbB family of tyrosine kinase receptor proteins, which includes c-erbb2(HER2/neu), erb-B3, and erb-B4. EGFR overexpression is found in a third of all epithelial cancers, often associated with a poor prognosis.\nProtein expression of EGFR in 27 cases of lung cancer tissue samples and 9 cases of normal lung tissue samples was evaluated using an immunohistochemical approach.\nThe results demonstrated significant increase and overexpression of EGFR in Bruneian lung cancer tissue samples in comparison to normal lung tissue. However, there was no significant relationship between clinicopathologic variables (age and sex) of patients and EGFR protein expression.\nEGFR is overexpressed in Bruneian lung cancer patient tissue samples in comparison to normal lung tissue samples. This may indicate that EGFR protein over expression plays an important role in the genesis of this type of cancer in Brunei Darussalam.","title":"Overexpression of EGFR protein in Bruneian lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"25640358"}
