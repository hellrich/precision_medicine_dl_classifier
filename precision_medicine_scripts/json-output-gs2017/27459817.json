However, the result of FNAC sometimes leads to a false negative, especially in cases of hypocellular lesions such as metastases with cystic change. Thyroglobulin measurement in fine needle aspirates (FNA-Tg) has been shown to be a useful technique to detect the protein specifically secreted by thyroid follicular cells. Elevated FNA-Tg levels in an extra-thyroidal lesion means that the lesion comprises thyroid-originated tissue, most of which suggests the metastasis from thyroid carcinoma. Thus, FNA-Tg is expected to improve the sensitivity of FNAC for the aforementioned purpose.\nFrom 2008 to 2012, 49 extra-thyroidal lesions from 43 patients with thyroid carcinoma were examined using both FNAC and FNA-Tg, followed by surgical resection with a histopathological diagnosis. The results were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed.\nAmong 49 lesions, 47 were metastatic lymph nodes from thyroid carcinoma (46 papillary carcinoma and one follicular carcinoma), one was a metastatic lymph node from submandibular gland adenocarcinoma, and one was an ectopic thyroid gland. In the 47 cases of thyroid carcinoma, the sensitivity of FNAC was 57.4% (27/47), whereas that of FNA-Tg was 76.6% (36/47). When both methods were combined, the sensitivity increased to 93.6% (44/47). Metastasis from submandibular gland adenocarcinoma was considered to be an example of a false positive from FNAC, whereas an ectopic thyroid gland was an FNA-Tg false positive. Three lesions were negative for both FNAC and FNA-Tg, although metastases were suspected by imaging studies and confirmed by histopathological diagnosis, which were consistent with examples of a false negative from both FNAC and FNA-Tg findings.\nFNAC reflects whether the lesion has malignant cells, whereas FNA-Tg reflects whether the lesion has thyroid-originated tissue that specifically secrets thyroglobulin. Therefore, FNAC and FNA-Tg are considered to be complementary to each other for the preoperative diagnosis of lymph node metastasis from thyroid carcinoma. FNA-Tg was validated to improve the preoperative diagnostic sensitivity especially when combined with FNAC, however, it is attended with the possibility of a false positive or negative finding, which requires caution in interpretation of the findings.","title":"[Usefulness and Limitation of Thyroglobulin Measurement in Fine Needle Aspirates (FNA-Tg) for Diagnosis of Neck Lymph Node Metastasis from Thyroid Carcinoma].","pubmedId":"27459817"}
