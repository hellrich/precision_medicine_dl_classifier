Most importantly, this compound targets heat shock response pathways by down-regulation of heat shock transcription factor 1 and consequential down-regulation of multiple heat shock proteins HSP27, HSP70 and HSP90. Down-regulation of these proteins caused the shut-down of several oncogenic pathways and caspase-dependent apoptosis resulting in a potent anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate the potential rewards gained in searching for anticancer candidates with multimodal actions on heat shock response pathways via HSF1 down-regulation.","title":"Targeting heat shock factor 1 with a triazole nucleoside analog to elicit potent anticancer activity on drug-resistant pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"22266185"}
