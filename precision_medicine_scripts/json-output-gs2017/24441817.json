I-CC subgroup: 27 patients compared with 54 controls; HCC-CC subgroup: 15 patients compared with 30 controls. Patients were also divided according to the preoperative tumor size and number: uninodular tumors 2 cm or smaller and multinodular or uninodular tumors 2 cm or larger. Median follow-up: 51 (range, 3-142) months.\nThe 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial survival rate differed between the study and control groups (83%, 70%, and 60% vs 99%, 94%, and 89%, respectively; P \u003c 0.001). Differences were found in 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial survival rates between the I-CC subgroup and their controls (78%, 66%, and 51% vs 100%, 98%, and 93%; P \u003c 0.001), but no differences were observed between the HCC-CC subgroup and their controls (93%, 78%, and 78% vs 97%, 86%, and 86%; P \u003d 0.9). Patients with uninodular tumors 2 cm or smaller in the study and control groups had similar 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate (92%, 83%, 62% vs 100%, 80%, 80%; P \u003d 0.4). In contrast, patients in the study group with multinodular or uninodular tumors larger than 2 cm had worse 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates than their controls (80%, 66%, and 61% vs 99%, 96%, and 90%; P \u003c 0.001).\nPatients with HCC-CC have similar survival to patients undergoing a transplant for HCC. Preoperative diagnosis of HCC-CC should not prompt the exclusion of these patients from transplant option.","title":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma in patients undergoing liver transplantation: a Spanish matched cohort multicenter study.","pubmedId":"24441817"}
