Intense molecular and genetic study has been used to characterize these tumors and develop treatment strategies. Although the mainstay of treatment remains surgical resection, therapy targeted at inhibiting tyrosine kinases has had dramatic results. Because of the rapid accumulation of information about the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network convened a GIST task force to provide updated recommendations in 2010. As understanding of these tumors advances, rapid changes in recommendations will continue and should warrant regular updates in tumor management.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor surgery and adjuvant therapy.","pubmedId":"21889030"}
