He underwent 5 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy( gemcitabine+S-1), which reduced the tumor volume and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level. R0 resection was performed via sub-stomach preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with combined resection of the PV and CHA. Adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine was administered at 4 weeks after the operation. Relevant neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered to contribute to R0 resection of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Here, we report a case of a successful R0 resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
