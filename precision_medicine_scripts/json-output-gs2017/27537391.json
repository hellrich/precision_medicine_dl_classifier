We studied the effects of oestrogen receptor (ER) status, other prognostic factors and treatments on survival in a large cohort of BRCA2 mutation carriers.\nWe identified 285 breast cancer patients with a 999del5 BRCA2 mutation and matched them with 570 non-carrier patients. Clinical information was abstracted from patient charts and pathology records and supplemented by evaluation of tumour grade and ER status using archived tissue specimens. Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios (HR) were estimated for breast cancer-specific survival using Cox regression. The effects of various therapies were studied in patients treated from 1980 to 2012.\nAmong mutation carriers, positive ER status was associated with higher risk of death than negative ER status (HR\u003d1.94; 95% CI\u003d1.22-3.07, P\u003d0.005). The reverse association was seen for non-carriers (HR\u003d0.71; 95% CI: 0.51-0.97; P\u003d0.03).\nAmong BRCA2 carriers, ER-positive status is an adverse prognostic factor. BRCA2 carrier status should be known at the time when treatment decisions are made.","title":"Oestrogen receptor status, treatment and breast cancer prognosis in Icelandic BRCA2 mutation carriers.","pubmedId":"27537391"}
