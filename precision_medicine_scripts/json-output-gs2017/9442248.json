The same tumors were subjected to molecular genetic screening by use of DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, DNA elution, and DNA sequencing for ras oncogenes and the p53 tumor suppressor gene.\nA broad spectrum of chromosome aberrations was observed, including trisomies, reciprocal translocations, and structural and numerical X-chromosome alterations and deletions. Molecular genetic analysis revealed a tumor suppressor p53 gene mutation in codon 249 of exon 7 in one instance. Interestingly, analyzed mammary tumors were free of mutations in N-ras, K-ras and H-ras, exons 1 and 2.\nChromosome alterations are wide-spread in canine mammary tumors, but no ras family mutations were detected in tumors from these 10 dogs.\nKnowledge about chromosome, oncogene, and tumor suppressor gene damage could be helpful for diagnosis and prognosis of neoplastic diseases in dogs.","title":"Cytogenetic alterations in eight mammary tumors and tumor-suppressor gene p53 mutation in one mammary tumor from dogs.","pubmedId":"9442248"}
