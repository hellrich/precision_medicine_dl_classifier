Statins have reported antitumor activity, but it is unknown whether simvastatin can reverse cetuximab resistance in KRAS mutant CRC.\nHuman CRC cell lines with KRAS mutations (LS153, LS174T, DLD1, LoVo, SW403, SW480, SNU175, and LS1034) or with v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) mutations (DiFi, SW48, HT29, and RKO) were used to test the effect of cetuximab, simvastatin, and cetuximab plus simvastatin on cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro. Because BRAF(V600E) mutant may be responsible for cetuximab resistance in KRAS wild-type cells, we measured the growth of xenograft tumors originating from KRAS mutant and BRAF mutant cells in mice treated with cetuximab alone or plus simvastatin (n \u003d 5 mice per treatment group). We used immunoblot assays to study RAS-regulated activation of BRAF protein after simvastatin treatment. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nAddition of simvastatin (0.2 μM) to cetuximab (0.03-1.0 μM) reduced cell proliferation of KRAS mutant (P \u003c .001) but not of BRAF mutant CRC cells in vitro. Treatment of KRAS mutant cells with simvastatin reduced BRAF activity and induced apoptosis. Treatment with cetuximab and simvastatin reduced the growth of xenograft tumors originating from KRAS mutant cells compared with cetuximab alone (eg, for tumors originating from DLD1 cells, cetuximab vs cetuximab + simvastatin, mean tumor volume \u003d 49.4 vs 20.2 cm(3), mean difference \u003d 29.2 cm(3), 95% confidence interval \u003d 19.7 to 38.5, P \u003c .001); treatment with cetuximab alone or in combination with simvastatin had no effect on the growth of BRAF mutant tumors.\nSimvastatin may overcome cetuximab resistance in colon cancer cells with KRAS mutations by modulating BRAF activity and inducing apoptosis.","title":"Effect of simvastatin on cetuximab resistance in human colorectal cancer with KRAS mutations.","pubmedId":"21398618"}
