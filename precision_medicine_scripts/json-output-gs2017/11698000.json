The prognostic significance of the presence of c-Kit in acute myeloid leukemia is debated. Recently, c-kit inhibitors have been studied as possible therapies against hematopoietic malignancies; therefore, c-Kit detection may have important implications for treatment.\nIn this study, we investigated the expression of c-Kit in granulocytic sarcoma (GS) using paraffin-embedded tissue.\nRoutinely formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 30 cases of GS were studied using immunohistochemistry. c-Kit (C-19) (a polyclonal antibody against carboxy terminal domain of c-Kit p145 or CD117) reactivity was compared with myeloperoxidase and lysozyme. The immunohistochemical panel also included CD34, CD68, CD43, Bcl-2, CD45RB, CD20, CD3, CD10, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and CD79a.\nThe morphologic patterns included well-differentiated (5 cases), poorly differentiated (19 cases), and blastic forms (6 cases). Clinical data were obtained from 28 of 30 patients. Granulocytic sarcoma presented in lymph nodes in 10 cases, whereas in 20 cases it presented in extranodal sites. c-Kit reactivity was found in 87% (26/30) of the GS cases. There was no significant difference in c-Kit positivity between the nodal (90%, 9/10) and extranodal (85%, 17/20) neoplasms. c-Kit expression was not associated with the degree of the myeloid maturation. Two of 13 lymphoblastic lymphoma control cases and 1 of 28 of the large B-cell lymphomas were weakly immunoreactive with c-Kit.\nc-Kit reactivity can be demonstrated in a high percentage of GS cases; its presence may be useful not only in diagnosis, but also in the treatment of GS with new modalities.","title":"c-Kit (CD117) reactivity in extramedullary myeloid tumor/granulocytic sarcoma.","pubmedId":"11698000"}
