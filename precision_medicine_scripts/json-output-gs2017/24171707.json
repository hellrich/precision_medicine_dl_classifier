Although monosomy 22/del(22q) is present in half of all meningiomas, and meningiomas frequently carry NF2 mutations, no study has been reported so far in which both alterations are simultaneously assessed and correlated with the features of the disease.\nHere, we analyzed the frequency of both copy number changes involving chromosome 22 and NF2 mutations in 20 sporadic meningiomas using high-density SNP-arrays, interphase-FISH and PCR techniques.\nOur results show a significant frequency of NF2 mutations (6/20 patients, 30%), most of which (5/6) had not been previously reported in sporadic meningiomas. NF2 mutations involved five different exons and led to a truncated protein (p.Leu163CysfsX46, p.Phe62LeufsX61, p.Asp281MetfsX15, p.Phe285LeufsX11, p.Gln389ArgfsX37) and an in frame deletion of Phe119. Interestingly, all NF2 mutated cases were menopausal women with monosomy 22 but not del(22q).\nThese results confirm and extend on previous observations about the high frequency and heterogeneity of NF2 mutations in sporadic meningiomas and indicate they could be restricted to a well-defined cytogenetic and clinical subgroup of menopausal women. Further studies in large series of patients are required to confirm our observations.","title":"Association between mutation of the NF2 gene and monosomy 22 in menopausal women with sporadic meningiomas.","pubmedId":"24171707"}
