Variations in intensity and frequency of depression in cancer patients may be attributed, in part, to differences in personality dimensions. Our aim was to asses if dimensions of temperament and character could predict depression in lung cancer patients. Ninety newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer patients were assessed in the oncology unit with the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), pain subscale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C30 and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Fifty out of 90 patients (55.6%) fulfilled the cut-off criteria for depression on the CES-D scale. Logistic regression performed to assess if depression was predicted by personality dimensions, revealed dimension of temperament Harm Avoidance and pain as significant predictors of depression. Depressive reactions are highly prevalent in lung cancer patients and related to patients\u0027 personality. These findings may be helpful in planning preventive, as well as psychoeducational and treatment programmes for newly diagnosed, and depression prone patients.
