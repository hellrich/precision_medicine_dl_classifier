Employing the polyclonal anti-p75LNGFR antibody and the polyclonal anti-trkA antibody they report strong immunoreactivity for those antigens in the interstitial Leydig cells. Sertoli cells and some cellular elements of the germinative epithelium were also trkA-positive. These findings implicate the neurotrophic factor NGF and its receptors p75LNGFR and trkA in the autocrine and paracrine regulation of the steroidogenic activity of Leydig cells of the human testis.","title":"Immunocytochemical expression of p75LNGFR and trkA in Leydig cells of the human testis.","pubmedId":"10786205"}
