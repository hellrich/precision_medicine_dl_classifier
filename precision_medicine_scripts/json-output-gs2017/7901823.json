This overexpression was shown to be correlated with poor prognosis. We have investigated 38 samples of carcinomas of the male breast for p185erbB2 expression by using tumor thin sections and a monoclonal antibody. The immunostaining was compared to clinical data to assess a possible prognostic value of this parameter. Although most cases were immunopositive (36/38), no correlation to tumor grading and survival spans was notable. Therefore, erbB2 activity fails to add a new prognostic parameter in male breast carcinomas.","title":"Expression of the c-erbB2 proto-oncogene in male breast carcinoma: lack of prognostic significance.","pubmedId":"7901823"}
