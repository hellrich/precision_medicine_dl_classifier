Pre-operative whole body bone scan with 99 mTc did not reveal abnormal tracer concentration in the lungs. A similar follow-up bone scan six months post-operatively demonstrated an area of abnormal tracer concentration in the lower lobe of each lung.","title":"Pulmonary metastases on bone scan in a patient with osteogenic sarcoma.","pubmedId":"1307596"}
