We retrospectively analyzed our experiences with patients undergoing completion pancreatectomy for recurrent pancreatic cancer in the remnant pancreas.\nSix patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer in the remnant pancreas underwent completion pancreatectomy between March 2005 and December 2012. Operative, postoperative, and pathological data and long-term outcomes for these six patients were analyzed retrospectively.\nThere was no operative morbidity or mortality associated with completion pancreatectomy. The median survival times were 49.0 and 27.5 months after initial resection and second pancreatectomy, respectively. However, all six patients died during follow-up. Five patients had recurrent pancreatic cancer at the time of death. One patient had no recurrence but had poor blood sugar control and eventually died after repeated bouts of cholangitis.\nCompletion pancreatectomy is a safe and effective option in select patients with local pancreatic cancer recurrence in the remnant pancreas after initial pancreatectomy. It is essential to select patients who have a good performance status and can tolerate major surgery and the resultant apancreatic state.","title":"Completion pancreatectomy for recurrent pancreatic cancer in the remnant pancreas: report of six cases and a review of the literature.","pubmedId":"26545606"}
