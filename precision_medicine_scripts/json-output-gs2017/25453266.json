The aggressive nature, lack of early diagnostic and prognostic markers, late clinical presentation, and limited efficacy of existing treatment regimens make PC a lethal cancer with high mortality and poor prognosis. Therefore, novel reliable biomarkers and molecular targets are urgently needed to combat this deadly disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (19-24 nucleotides) non-coding RNA molecules implicated in the regulation of gene expression at post-transcriptional level and play significant roles in various physiological and pathological conditions. Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been reported in several cancers including PC and is implicated in PC pathogenesis and progression, suggesting their utility in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. In this review, we summarize the role of several miRNAs that regulate various oncogenes (KRAS) and tumor suppressor genes (p53, p16, SMAD4, etc.) involved in PC development, their prospective roles as diagnostic and prognostic markers and as a therapeutic targets.
