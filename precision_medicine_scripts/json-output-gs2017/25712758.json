Surgical decompression was performed at the tibial, superficial, deep and common peroneal nerves. Preoperatively, and at 6 and 12 months post operatively, a visual analogue scale for pain and the 36 item short-form health survey and EuroQual 5 Dimensions questionnaires were completed.\nAt 12 months follow-up, the visual analogue scale was significantly reduced, but decompression surgery did not significantly alter health-related quality of life scores. The minimal clinically important difference for visual analogue scale reduction was determined at 2.9 points decrease, a threshold reached by 42.5% of the study population.\nAlthough decompression surgery does not influence health-related quality of life, it achieves a clinically relevant reduction of pain in ~42.5% of people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. It can therefore be considered for patients who do not adequately respond to pain medication.","title":"The effect of lower extremity nerve decompression on health-related quality of life and perception of pain in patients with painful diabetic polyneuropathy: a prospective randomized trial.","pubmedId":"25712758"}
