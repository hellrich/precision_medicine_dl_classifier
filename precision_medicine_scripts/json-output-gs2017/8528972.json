Complete tumor resection in this respect refers to the primary tumor as well as the lymphatic drainage and requires an adequate safety margin. The indications for surgical therapy of gastric cancer and the choice of procedure should consequently be guided by the tumor stage. This requires accurate preoperative staging, which can today be achieved with endoscopic ultrasonography and surgical laparoscopy. Gastric carcinoma stage IA (mucosa carcinoma) can be cured by local excision. In patients with tumor stages IB (submucosa carcinoma), II, and IIIA, lymph node metastases are common. Based on the available data, this group of patients benefits from radical resection and D2 lymph node dissection. In patients with advanced gastric carcinoma, that is, tumor stages IIIB and IV, a complete tumor removal usually can not be achieved by surgical resection. Neoadjuvant therapeutic modalities should consequently be assessed in these patients. Based on tumor location and growth pattern, a total gastrectomy is the procedure of choice in patients with middle and proximal third gastric cancer. A subtotal gastrectomy may be performed in patients with tumors of the distal third and \"Laur√©n\u0027s intestinal type\" growth pattern. Depending on the individual tumor situation, the gastrectomy can be extended toward varying portions of the distal esophagus or a pancreas, preserving splenectomy and resection of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Surgical therapy for gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"8528972"}
