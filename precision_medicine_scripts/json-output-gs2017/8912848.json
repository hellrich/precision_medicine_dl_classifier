Reifenberger et al., Cancer Res., 54, 4299-4303, 1994). The genes most frequently amplified and overexpressed were CDK4 (with coamplification of SAS) and MDM2. Because individual malignant gliomas showed CDK4/SAS amplification but no MDM2 amplification and vice versa, the possibility remained of a common amplification target gene located between CDK4 and MDM2. We have addressed this question by performing a detailed amplicon mapping of a series of 24 primary malignant gliomas and two glioblastoma cell lines with 12q13-q15 amplification. All tumors and cell lines were analyzed at eight gene loci and six anonymous loci from 12q13-q15, including seven loci located between CDK4 and MDM2. These studies revealed two centers of amplification, one at CDK4/SAS and the other at MDM2. A number of loci located close to either MDM2 or CDK4/SAS, including the genes GADD153, GLI, RAP1B, A2MR, and IFNG, were found to be coamplified in some tumors but not overexpressed consistently. All amplicons were discontinuous between CDK4/SAS and MDM2. Our results thus exclude a common amplification target between CDK4/SAS and MDM2 and provide additional evidence that these genes represent two independent targets of selection.","title":"Refined mapping of 12q13-q15 amplicons in human malignant gliomas suggests CDK4/SAS and MDM2 as independent amplification targets.","pubmedId":"8912848"}
