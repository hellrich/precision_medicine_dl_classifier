Subclinical hypertensive heart disease was classified as the presence of: LVH, abnormal ejection fraction (EF), or diastolic dysfunction.\nThirty-nine patients with EBP were enrolled. The mean age was 46 years (SD \u003d 10.9), 59% were women, 21% were smokers, and 92% had a history of hypertension. The average body mass index was 30.7 (SD \u003d 8.7). Patients were 67% African American, 23% Latino, 5% Caucasian, 3% Asian, and 3% Native American. Subclinical disease was found in 39%: 31% had LVH, 15% had diastolic dysfunction, and 8% had abnormal EF. On bivariate analysis, elevated BP (p \u003d 0.039) and blood urea nitrogen (p \u003d 0.016) were correlated with subclinical heart disease. After adjusting for other covariates, receiving oral/intravenous antihypertensive medications in the ED (p \u003d 0.005) was associated with subclinical heart disease.\nWe found a point prevalence of subclinical heart disease of 39% in this urban ED population, using LBE. Real-time identification of subclinical heart disease at early stages in the ED in conjunction with abnormal renal function can help emergency physicians identify those patients in need of more aggressive therapy and urgent follow-up.","title":"Correlation between Subclinical Heart Disease and Cardiovascular Risk Profiles in an Urban Emergency Department Population with Elevated Blood Pressures: A Pilot Study.","pubmedId":"25802165"}
