Follow-up was available 3-114 months (median, 28 months).\nPatients with distal bile duct cancer lived longer than patients with proximal bile duct cancer (survival with Kaplan-Meier analysis, 53% vs 13% at 5 years, respectively, P \u003c .01). Median survival in patients with proximal cancer after RT was more than double that without RT (17 months vs 6 months, respectively, regardless of stage [P \u003d .01]); survival was not significantly different after resection. In patients with distal cancer, RT after resection made no significant difference in median survival (68 months).\nPatients with proximal cancer should undergo primary RT, and expectations should be limited. Patients with distal cancer should undergo resection, and RT may not be needed.","title":"Cholangiocarcinoma: clinical significance of tumor location along the extrahepatic bile duct.","pubmedId":"7480704"}
