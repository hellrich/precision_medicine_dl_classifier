Our aim was to evaluate the main effect of selected candidate genes on the development of meningioma and their possible interaction with ionizing radiation in the causation of this tumor. The total study population included 440 cases and controls: 150 meningioma patients who were irradiated for tinea capitis in childhood, 129 individuals who were similarly irradiated but did not develop meningioma, 69 meningioma patients with no previous history of irradiation, and 92 asymptomatic population controls. DNA from peripheral blood samples was genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 12 genes: NF2, XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC5, ERCC2, Ki-ras, p16, cyclin D1, PTEN, E-cadherin, TGFB1, and TGFBR2. SNP analysis was done using the MassArray system (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) and computerized analysis by SpectroTYPER. Logistic regressions were applied to evaluate main effect of each gene on meningioma formation and interaction between gene and radiation. Intragenic SNPs in the Ki-ras and ERCC2 genes were associated with meningioma risk (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.92 and odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.84, respectively). A significant interaction was found between radiation and cyclin D1 and p16 SNPs (P for interaction \u003d 0.005 and 0.057, respectively). Our findings suggest that Ki-ras and ERCC2 SNPs are possible markers for meningioma formation, whereas cyclin D1 and p16 SNPs may be markers of genes that have an inverse effect on the risk to develop meningioma in irradiated and nonirradiated populations.","title":"Genotyping of patients with sporadic and radiation-associated meningiomas.","pubmedId":"15824172"}
