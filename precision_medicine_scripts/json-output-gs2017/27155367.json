They are presumed to arise from the acquisition of a gene mutation in an embryonic melanocyte that becomes trapped in the dermis during development. Mice bearing the Cdk4(R24C) ::Tyr-NRAS(Q) (61K) transgenes develop congenital nevus-like lesions by post-natal day 10, from melanocytes escaping the confines of hair follicles. We interbred these mice with the collaborative cross (CC), a resource that enables identification of modifier genes for complex diseases (those where multiple genes are involved). We examined variation in nevus cell density in 66 CC strains and mapped a large-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling nevus cell density to murine chromosome 9. The best candidate for a gene that exacerbates congenital nevus development in the context of an NRAS mutation is Cdon, a positive regulator of sonic hedgehog (Shh) that is expressed mainly in keratinocytes.
