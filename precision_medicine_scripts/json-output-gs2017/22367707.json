We report the effect of chemotherapy with panitumumab as first-line therapy for KRAS wild-type irresectable biliary tract cancer.\nPatients were treated with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2), oxaliplatin 60 mg/m(2), and panitumumab 6 mg/kg i.v. every 2 weeks followed by two daily administrations of capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) in 7 days.\nDuring 22 months, 46 patients were included in a single institution. The primary end point, fraction of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months, was 31/42 [74%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 58% to 84%]. Forty-two patients had measurable disease. Response rate was 33% and disease control rate 86%. Median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI 6.7-8.7 months) and median overall survival was 10.0 months (95% CI 7.4-12.7 months). Toxicity was manageable including eight cases of epidermal growth factor receptor-related skin adverse events of grade 2 or more.\nMarker-driven patient selection is feasible in the systemic treatment of biliary tract cancer. Combination chemotherapy with panitumumab in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors met the efficacy criteria for future testing in a randomized trial.","title":"Phase II marker-driven trial of panitumumab and chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type biliary tract cancer.","pubmedId":"22367707"}
