A retrospective study was made of all patients with colon cancer at our institution and the associated Veterans Administration Hospital between 1974 and 1983 to help assess the need for more extensive colon resection in patients with colon cancer and synchronous adenomatous polyps. At our hospitals 470 new cases of colon cancer were identified. Nine percent (44/470) had colon cancer and concurrent adenomatous polyps. Seven (16%) of these 44 patients developed metachronous colon cancer, as compared with four of 426 patients without polyps at the initial surgery (p less than 0.001). Four patients without polyps at the initial surgery developed polyps at a later date; three of the four patients developed metachronous colon cancer. We believe that more extensive colon resection, such as total colectomy and ileoproctostomy, may play a role in preventing the occurrence of metachronous colon cancer in patients with colon cancer and synchronous adenomatous polyps. In addition, if adenomatous polyps develop after colon surgery, close endoscopic follow-up is required.","title":"Management of nonfamilial adenomatous polyps and colon cancers.","pubmedId":"4049244"}
