To overcome this difficulty, we applied CGH technology to cells obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA).\nIn the present study, we performed EUS-FNA for 17 patients with pancreatic cancer before surgery. Tumor cells were selected by microdissection. DNA was extracted from the cells and amplified by degenerate oligonucleotide-primed polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR). Then CGH was carried out.\nIn the 15 patients with tubular adenocarcinoma, the most common loci of gains (including amplification) were 5p, 8q, and 20q (60% of the patients); and 1q, 7p, and 12p (27%). The most frequent losses were 17p (73%); 9p, 18q, and 19p (47%); and 8p (33%). These findings were similar to our previously reported data. Both of the patients with acinar cell carcinoma showed gains of 2q and 5p, and losses of 1p, 9p, 9q, 11p, 11q, 14q, 17p, 17q, and 18q.\nThe results of this study suggest that comprehensive genetic analysis is possible for EUS-FNA biopsy specimens, with a combination of microdissection and DOP-PCR. This analytical strategy will enable us to evaluate the biological characteristics of pancreatic cancer before treatment.","title":"Comparative genomic hybridization analysis for pancreatic cancer specimens obtained by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration.","pubmedId":"15942717"}
