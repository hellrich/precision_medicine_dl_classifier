High levels of p-mTOR, p-4EBP1 and p-p70S6K expression were defined in 48.1% (37/77), 50.6% (39/77) and 51.9% (40/77) of all tumors, respectively. No significant correlation was observed between mTOR pathway proteins overexpression with clinicopathological characteristics and patient\u0027s prognosis, except that high p-p70S6K expression correlated with the poorly differentiated subtype, and high expression of p-4EBP1 predicted poor prognosis in ICC patients and retained an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, our results showed high prevalence of activation of mTOR pathway in ICC tumors, suggesting that a high proportion of ICC patients might benefit from mTOR pathway targeted therapies. In addition, p-4EBP1 phosphorylation at Thr 70 could be a useful prognostic biomarker for ICC patients.","title":"Immunohistochemical analysis of the mTOR pathway in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22248270"}
