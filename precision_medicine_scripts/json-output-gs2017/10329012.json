In the context of an ongoing research program aiming at the elucidation of the functional consequences of HMGIC translocations in the etiology of lipomas, we have isolated a novel human gene, LHFP (lipoma HMGIC fusion partner), that acts as a translocation partner of HMGIC in a lipoma with t(12;13). The LHFP gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 13, a region recurrently targeted by chromosomal aberrations in lipomas. By Northern blot analysis, a transcript of 2. 4 kb was detected in a variety of human tissues. We assembled a cDNA contig containing the entire coding region of LHFP. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the composite LHFP cDNA revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein of 200 amino acids. The predicted human LHFP protein is almost identical to a translated mouse EST that covers almost the entire LHFP coding region. In addition, BLAST searches revealed that the LHFP protein belongs to a new protein family consisting of at least four or five members. In the lipoma studied, the expressed HMGIC/LHFP fusion transcript encodes the three DNA binding domains of HMGIC followed by 69 amino acids encoded by frame-shifted LHFP sequences. LHFP is the second translocation partner of HMGIC identified in lipomas and represents a candidate target gene for lipomas with 13q aberrations.","title":"LHFP, a novel translocation partner gene of HMGIC in a lipoma, is a member of a new family of LHFP-like genes.","pubmedId":"10329012"}
