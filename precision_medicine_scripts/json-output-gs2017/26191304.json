GISTs with PDGFRA mutations have been found to have several characteristic morphological features, sometimes allowing to discriminate them from GISTs with c-kit mutations. Among these, epithelioid morphology in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating mast cells are powerful predictors of PDGFRA mutations. Although myxoid stroma by itself is not so much a reliable predictor of PDGFRA mutation, myxoid stroma in conjunction with epithelioid morphology in tumor cells is a powerful predictor of mutations in this gene. GISTs showing either weak or negative immunoreactivity for c-kit and epithelioid cells with myxoid stroma are called myxoid epithelioid GISTs, which typically show PDGFRA mutation. Herein, we presented a case of a 59-year-old woman with myxoid epithelioid GIST of the stomach. A unique finding in this case was eosinophil infiltration, probably more numerous than mast cells; mast cell infiltration is known to be usually found in myxoid epithelioid GIST. The existence of a similar mechanism in eosinophil and mast cell recruitment via tumor-producing stem cell factor is speculated. Mutational analyses revealed a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation: D842_H845del, D846N. Combined deletion and substitution mutation has been reported in rare instances, but to the best of our knowledge, D846N has not been documented.
