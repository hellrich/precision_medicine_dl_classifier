A 32-year-old female suffered from a headache without any other neurological abnormalities. She had no particular family or past history. The extracranial extending meningioma was removed at the first operation. The meningioma of the jugular foramen was removed at the second staged operation by transcondylar approach. A meningioma of the jugular foramen is rare, and the meningioma with extracranial extension via the jugular foramen without showing disturbances of lower cranial nerves has not been reported so far.","title":"[A case of meningioma of the jugular foramen without disturbance of lower cranial nerves].","pubmedId":"9181595"}
