In this model, KRAS oncogene expression is driven by an elastase promoter in acinar cells of the pancreas on an FVB/NTac (FVB) background [FVB-Tg(Ela-KRAS(G12D))] with the transgene carried on the Y chromosome. Through linkage analysis of crosses between the C57BL/6J (B6), BALB/cJ (BALB), and DBA/2J (D2) inbred strains of mice and resistant FVB-Tg(Ela-KRAS(G12D)), we have identified six susceptibility loci that affect mean preinvasive lesion multiplicity. Markers on chromosome 2 segregated with high tumor multiplicity in all three strains; these loci were designated Prsq1-3 (pancreatic ras susceptibility quantitative trait loci 1-3; combined F2 and N2 LOD(W), 6.0, 4.1, and 2.7, respectively). Susceptibility loci on chromosome 4, designated Prsq4 and Prsq5, were identified in crosses between FVB transgenic mice and B6 or BALB mice (combined F2 and N2 LOD(W), 3.6 and 2.9, respectively). A marker on chromosome 12 segregated with tumor multiplicity in a BALB × FVB-Tg(Ela-KRAS(G12D)) cross and was designated Prsq6 (LOD(W), ∼2.5). B6-Chr Y(FVB-Tg(Ela-KRASG12D)) and BALB-Chr Y(FVB-Tg(Ela-KRASG12D)) consomics, which carry the KRAS transgene on the FVB Y chromosome on an otherwise inbred B6 or BALB background, developed ∼4-fold (B6) and ∼10-fold (BALB) more lesions than FVB-Tg(Ela-KRAS(G12D)) mice. By 12 months of age, 10% of BALB-Chr Y(FVB-Tg(Ela-KRASG12D)) mice developed invasive carcinomas. Our findings provide evidence that regions of chromosomes 2, 4, and 12 influence the development and progression of pancreatic neoplasms initiated by an oncogenic allele of KRAS in mice.","title":"Identification of susceptibility loci in a mouse model of KRASG12D-driven pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"20959479"}
