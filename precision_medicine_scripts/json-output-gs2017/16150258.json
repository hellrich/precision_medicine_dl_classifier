Through 1999, cancers were ascertained by questionnaire, cancer and death registries. Poisson regression estimated adjusted rate ratios (RRs).\nClomiphene use did not significantly increase risk of melanoma (RR\u003d1.66; 95% CI, 0.9-3.1), thyroid (RR\u003d1.42; 95% CI, 0.5-3.7), cervical (RR\u003d1.61; 95% CI, 0.5-4.7), or colon cancer (RR\u003d0.83; 95% CI, 0.4-1.9). We found no relationship between clomiphene dose or cycles of use and cancer risk at any site. Clomiphene use may impart stronger effects on risks of melanoma (RR\u003d2.00; 95% CI, 0.9-4.6) and thyroid cancer among women who remained nulliparous (RR\u003d4.23; 95% CI, 1.0-17.1). Gonadotropins did not increase cancer risk for these sites.\nFertility drugs do not appear to have strong effects on these cancers. Nonetheless, follow-up should be pursued to assess long-term risks and to monitor effects among women who remain nulliparous.","title":"Melanoma, thyroid, cervical, and colon cancer risk after use of fertility drugs.","pubmedId":"16150258"}
