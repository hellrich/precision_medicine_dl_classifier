As PARK2 is both a tumor suppressor gene and frequently mutated in young onset PD, we evaluated the role of PARK2 in melanoma predisposition and progression.\nAn in-depth PARK2 gene dosage analysis and sequencing was performed on 512 French case patients and 562 healthy control patients, as well as sporadic tumors and melanoma cell lines. The frequency of genetic alterations was compared between case patients and control patients using two-sided Fisher\u0027s exact tests and odds ratio (OR) calculations. We used western blotting to determine PARKIN expression in melanocytes and melanoma cell lines and transfection followed by clonogenic assays to evaluate the effect of PARKIN expression on cellular proliferation. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nGermline PARK2 mutations (including copy number variations, splicing, and putative deleterious missense mutations) were present in 25 case patients but only four control patients (OR \u003d 3.95, 95% confidence interval \u003d 1.34 to 15.75). Copy number variations (CNVs) and loss of heterozygosity were present in 60% and 74%, respectively, of primary tumors. PARKIN protein was expressed in melanocytes but not in most melanoma cell lines, and its expression decreased following melanocyte transformation by oncogenic NRAS. Re-expression of PARKIN in melanoma cell lines resulted in a drastic reduction of cell proliferation and inhibition of PARKIN in melanocytes stimulated their proliferation.\nOur results show an important role for PARK2 as a tumor suppressor both in melanoma predisposition and progression, which could explain the epidemiological association of these diseases.","title":"PARKIN Inactivation Links Parkinson\u0027s Disease to Melanoma.","pubmedId":"26683220"}
