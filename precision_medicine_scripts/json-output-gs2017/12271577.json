The first type is characterized by superficial mucous disorders with constant or increased secretory function and motility of the stomach. It has relapsing course with moderate decrease of patient\u0027s life quality. The abdominal pains and dyspepsia are observed only at periods of exacerbation. Anxiety-phobic and anxiety-depressive tendencies prevail in the mental status. The attitude to illness differs mainly by emotional-willed disorders. Insomnia is manifested by a slight delay in awakening. Focal atrophic gastritis with moderate decrease in secretory and motor functions of the stomach is typical for the second type. It develops as relapsing or monotonous suffering with insignificant decrease in patient\u0027s life quality. The pains and dyspepsia in residual state persist after exacerbation reduction. The changes in the mental status are rare. The patient\u0027s attitude to the illness is basically adequate. Slight disturbances of falling asleep prevail among sleep disorders. Diffuse atrophic gastritis with secretory failure reaching the degree of an achlorhydria and hypokinesis of stomach are observed in the third type. The course of the disease is basically monotonous with pronounced decrease in patient\u0027s life quality, with the obstinate abdominal pains and dyspepsia irrespective of the exacerbation phases of chronic gastritis. A combination of asthenic and neurotic complaints and combined sleep disorders are typical. Emotional disorders with disharmonization of personality accompanied by signs of their social and mental disadaptation are observed in the patient\u0027s mental status.","title":"[Chronic gastritis: keys to understanding the internal picture of the disease].","pubmedId":"12271577"}
