The identification of the exact SCN type required the distinction of the cystic and solid pattern; SCNs were usually composed of a mixture of main cells (MCs) and C-cells (CCs). The immunohistochemical calcitonin stain identified CCs easily, both inside SCNs and dispersed in islets at the periphery. For the characterization of MCs, we added the utility of p40 to p63. The use of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) helped in their identification, as MCs did not react with this marker; the combination of TTF-1 and p40 or p63 IHC stains was useful for the characterization of cystic SCNs of both types 3 and 4. The negativity of mouse monoclonal mesothelioma antibody (HMBE-1) and a very low proliferative index (MIB-1) supported the diagnosis. [Correction added on 23 November 2015, after online publication: MIB-1 was incorrectly defined, the expanded form was deleted.] We discourage the use of galectin-3 (Gal-3) and cytokeratin-19 (CK-19), as they have an important overlap with papillary thyroid carcinoma. The complete absence of any B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutations is an additional fundamental finding.\nWe reviewed the most relevant morphological and immunohistochemical features of SCNs and have provided a genetic analysis of the BRAF gene because of its expanding use in thyroid pathology.","title":"Solid cell nests of the thyroid gland: morphological, immunohistochemical and genetic features.","pubmedId":"26334919"}
