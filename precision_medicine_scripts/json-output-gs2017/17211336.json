Neoadjuvant strategies are recent in pancreatic cancer: in primary resectable tumors, they ensure that all patients obtain additional treatment to complete surgery; in locally advanced tumors, they allow a better selection of candidates for curative resection. By delaying surgery, neoadjuvant strategies modify the initial diagnostic process and the symptomatic treatment of pancreatic cancer. Several recent phase I-II studies have confirmed the feasibility and efficacy of the association of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which is well-tolerated and is associated with better local control and survival. Due to the aggressiveness of pancreatic cancers, most recent cytotoxic agents should be associated with modern radiation techniques. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is under evaluation in pancreatic cancers, and no randomized phase III trials comparing neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapeutic sequences has been reported. Moreover, radiological and pathological evaluations, not only at diagnosis, but also after preoperative chemoradiation, must be standardized to improve the selection of patients who will benefit from this multi-modal treatment.","title":"[The role of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in pancreatic cancer].","pubmedId":"17211336"}
