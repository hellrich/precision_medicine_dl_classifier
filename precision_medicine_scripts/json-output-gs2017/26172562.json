No approved targeted therapies are currently available after initial EGFR TKI treatment. This study investigated the efficacy of continuing EGFR TKI therapy with local treatments for patients with NSCLC and local progression or minimal/slow progression on TKI therapy.\nFifty-five patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs and developed acquired resistance to the drug were included. Initial response to target therapy, median progression free survival (PFS1), progression pattern, and first progression site were assessed. Median progression free survival to physician assessment progression (PFS2) and difference between PFS1 and PFS2 (PFS difference) were also recorded.\nPFS1 was 11.2 months, PFS2 was 20.3 months, and PFS difference was 8.3 months. Nineteen patients (34.5%) who manifested progression received local therapy, and 16 (28.6%) underwent rebiopsy after progression with six positive EGFR T790M mutations detected. Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that only the first line of treatment was significantly correlated with PFS difference. NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs could benefit from the same TKI therapy through months to years of disease control.","title":"Continuation of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment prolongs disease control in non-small-cell lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","pubmedId":"26172562"}
