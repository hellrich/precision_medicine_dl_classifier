Thirteen EML4-ALK fusion variants have been identified, affecting eight EML4 exons. We have developed an exon scanning approach using multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify known and potential variants involving the first 22 EML4 exons. A total of 55 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung cancer tumors were screened, of which 5 (9%) were positive for EML4-ALK fusions. Four positive cases harbored known fusion variants: variant 3a, 3b, or both in three cases and variant 1 in one case. The fifth positive specimen harbored two novel variants, designated 8a and 8b, involving exon 17 of EML4. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of EML4-ALK fusions in three of the four RT-PCR-positive specimens with sufficient tissue for examination, and also confirmed absence of fusions in all 19 RT-PCR-negative specimens tested. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed ALK protein expression in the sample containing the novel 8a and 8b variants. This RT-PCR-based exon scanning approach avoids the limitations of screening only for previously identified EML4-ALK fusions and provides a simple molecular assay for fusion detection in a clinical diagnostics setting.","title":"Exon scanning by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for detection of known and novel EML4-ALK fusion variants in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21356191"}
