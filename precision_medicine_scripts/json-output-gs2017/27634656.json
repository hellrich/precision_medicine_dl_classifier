Histological subtypes with stem cell (SC) features (the SC subtype) have different clinicopathological significance in cHC-CC. The mutational status may reflect the clinicopathological subgroup of cHC-CC together with the histological subtype.\nWe examined the mutational statuses of KRAS, IDH1 or IDH2 (IDH1/2), ARID1A, the TERT promoter, and TP53, and their relationships with clinicopathological features in 53 patients with cHC-CC. Background liver diseases were hepatitis B (n \u003d 9), hepatitis C (n \u003d 22), alcoholic liver disease (n \u003d 5), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n \u003d 8), and unknown (n \u003d 9). Mutations in KRAS, IDH1/2, ARID1A, the TERT promoter and TP53 were detected in four (7.5%), six (11.8%) seven (13.2%), 16 (31.3%), and 24 patients (45.3%), respectively. KRAS mutations correlated with higher histological diversity scores and a higher M-factor (P \u003c 0.05). ARID1A mutations correlated with alcoholic liver disease, smaller tumour size, a lower grade of coexistent HCC, and α-fetoprotein (AFP) positivity, and were associated with cholangiolocellular carcinoma subtype predominance (P \u003c 0.05). TERT promoter mutations correlated with hepatitis B, an intermediate subtype-predominant histology, higher clinical stage, and a higher N-factor (P \u003c 0.05), and were associated with gender (female-predominant) and previous therapy. TP53 mutations correlated with AFP positivity (P \u003c 0.05).\nThe results of the mutational analysis revealed that cHC-CC has diverse types of mutations, and also that mutations in the TERT promoter and ARID1A may reflect aetiological impact, different histological subtypes, histogenesis, and tumour aggressiveness. These results suggest the potential efficacy of molecular-based subclassification of cHC-CC.","title":"Mutational landscape of combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, and its clinicopathological significance.","pubmedId":"27634656"}
