We tested the hypothesis that a gene variant in STK11 contributes to variation in insulin sensitivity and metformin efficacy.\nWe studied the effects of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs8111699) in STK11 on endocrine-metabolic and body composition indexes before and after 1 year of metformin in 85 hyperinsulinemic girls with androgen excess, representing a continuum from prepuberal girls with a combined history of low birth weight and precocious pubarche over to postmenarchial girls with hyperinsulinemic ovarian hyperandrogenism. Metformin was dosed at 425 mg/day in younger girls and 850 mg/day in older girls. STK11 rs8111699 was genotyped. Endocrine-metabolic features were assessed in the fasting state; body composition was estimated by absorptiometry.\nGenotype effects were similar in younger and older girls. At baseline, the mutated G allele in STK11 rs8111699 was associated with higher insulin and IGF-I levels (both P \u003c 0.005). The response to metformin differed by STK11 genotype: GG homozygotes (n \u003d 24) had robust metabolic improvements, GC heterozygotes (n \u003d 38) had intermediate responses, and CC homozygotes (n \u003d 23) had almost no response. Such differences were found for 1-year changes in body composition, circulating insulin, IGF-I, free androgen index, and lipids (all P \u003c 0.005).\nIn hyperinsulinemic girls with androgen excess, the STK11 rs8111699 SNP influences insulin sensitivity and metformin efficacy, so that the girls with the least favorable endocrine-metabolic profile improve most with metformin therapy.","title":"A single nucleotide polymorphism in STK11 influences insulin sensitivity and metformin efficacy in hyperinsulinemic girls with androgen excess.","pubmedId":"20357370"}
