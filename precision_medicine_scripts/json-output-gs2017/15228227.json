We report twin sisters with PJS who were found to be homozygous, based on analyses of 9 DNA markers containing short tandem repeats (STR). Aberrant expression of a putative tumor suppressor gene, STK11, which encodes a serine threonine kinase, has been suggested as the etiologic factor in PJS. In both of the twin sisters with PJS, mRNA analyses by RT-PCR demonstrated a complete lack of STK11 gene expression. These results provide direct evidence that STK11 gene expression is abnormal in PJS. Detecting abnormal expression of the STK11 gene may serve as a molecular approach to the diagnosis of PJS and may facilitate genotype-phenotype correlations in PJS patients.","title":"Lack of STK11 gene expression in homozygous twins with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","pubmedId":"15228227"}
