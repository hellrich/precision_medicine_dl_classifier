Subconfluent or postconfluent CaSki human cervical carcinoma cells were exposed to CPT (1-5000 ng/ml) and immediately X-irradiated (0-800 cGy). Cell survival was determined by clonogenic assay.\nMean topo I activity in cervical cancer (3.0 +/- 0.06 h(-1)) was significantly greater than in normal cervix tissue (0.29 +/- 0.06 h(-1)). Stage 3 and 4 cervical carcinoma specimens displayed a trend of greater topo I activity (5.88 +/- 3.7 h(-1)) than stage 1 and 2 tumors (2.57 +/- 0.47 h(-1)). No correlation between topo I protein levels and catalytic activity was found. Combined treatment of subconfluent CaSki cells with CPT and ionizing radiation resulted in additive killing of cells. Combined treatment of postconfluent CaSki cells with low doses of radiation (200 and 400 cGy) and 1 or 10 ng/ml CPT for 2 or 48 h produced significant cytotoxicity compared to CPT or radiation alone, which were ineffective at these doses.\nTopo I activity is elevated in cervical cancer compared to normal cervix. The radiosensitivity of noncycling cells within cervical tumors may be increased by simultaneous treatment with low doses of CPT or other topo I inhibitors.","title":"Elevated topoisomerase I activity in cervical cancer as a target for chemoradiation therapy.","pubmedId":"11063656"}
