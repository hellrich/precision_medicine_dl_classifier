However, the role of estrogen signaling in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression remains unclear.Aim: To investigate the prognostic role of ERβ in a female cohort of CRC.Methods: A tumor tissue microarray of primary CRCs from 333 female patients was stained with a mouse monoclonal anti-ERβ antibody. The intensity of staining was evaluated using immunohistochemistry technique. The expression of ERβ was scored using the semi-quantitative method [IRS (immune-reactive score) \u003d SI (staining intensity) x PP (percentage of positive nuclei)]. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were the primary outcomes. Preliminary results are presented.Results: From 321 patients eligible for survival analysis only 315 had successful measurement of ERβ (141 with low expression and 174 with high expression). The univariate analysis showed no effect of ERβ on OS, but high ERβ was associated with lower risk of cancer recurrence as indicated by DFS (HR, 0.61; CI, 0.38-1.02). Cox multivariate analysis indicated that, compared to low expression, high expression of ERβ was significantly associated with a decreased risk of cancer recurrence (HR, 0.39; CI, 0.20-0.77), after adjustment for age, tumor stage, tumor intravascular invasion and hormonal contraception use. Likewise, high ERβ expression was associated with better OS in patients with cancer stage I-III (HR, 0.52; CI, 0.29-0.94) that did not receive adjuvant treatment after operation. Premenopausal women had a higher mean of IRS for ERβ compared to postmenopausal women (p \u003d 0.03).Conclusion: High levels of ERβ significantly correlate with a decreased risk of cancer recurrence in CRC patients. We also noted longer overall survival in the subgroup of patients with cancer stage I-III that had not received adjuvant treatment after operation. The same results of OS were observed for colon cancer patients, but not for rectal cancer patients. A possible explanation could be that most of the rectal cancer patients have undergone radiotherapy before surgery, which might affect the status of ERβ.","title":"The prognostic role of estrogen receptor beta in a female cohort of colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-5640"}
