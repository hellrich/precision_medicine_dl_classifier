There are four histological types: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acrolentiginous melanoma and lentigo maligna melanoma. The TNM classification considers depth of infiltration (Clark\u0027s level), vertical tumor thickness (Breslow\u0027s thickness), ulceration of the primary tumor, satellites and in-transit metastases as well as regional lymph node and distant metastases. An adequate margin of clearance is important in primary resection. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is relevant in all melanomas with a Breslow tumor thickness \u003e1 mm without clinically suspicious lymph nodes. In the case of lymph node metastases therapeutic dissection is recommended, in patients with in-transit metastases of the extremities hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with cytostatic agents may be indicated. Resection of distant metastases can be useful if only one site is affected or a R0 resection is expected to be achieved. Adjuvant, neoadjuvant and palliative procedures, such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy are additional treatment options.","title":"[Malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"19444395"}
