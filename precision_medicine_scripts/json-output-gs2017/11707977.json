To elucidate the significance of liver resection, we examined 72 cases (H2: 29 cases, H3: 43 cases). The 3-year survival rate for H2 and H3 patients was 71.5% and 4.5%, respectively. The liver resection rate in H2 and H3 patients was 58.6% (17/29) and 16.3% (7/43), respectively. In H2 patients the 3-year survival rate of those with liver resection and non-resection was 71.3% and 9.2%, respectively (p \u003c 0.001). However, in H3 patients the 3-year survival rate in liver resection and non-resection patients was 80.0% and 43.9%, respectively (not significant). Many therapies, such as liver resection, hepatic arterial infusion, and systemic chemotherapy, were attempted for patients with hepatic metastases. Our data show that liver resection can prolong the survival of H2 patients only. On the other hand, hepatic arterial infusion therapy prolongs the survival of H3 patients only. Systemic chemotherapy does not prolong the survival of either H2 or H3 patients.","title":"[Significance of liver resection for multiple hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"11707977"}
