Previous studies have reported sensitivities and specificities ranging from 80%-90% and accuracies of approximately 85%. Our goal was to determine the accuracy of EUS-FNA for detecting PDA in individual patients at our institution.  Methods:  We conducted a retrospective chart review using the Clinical Cancer Research Database at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI).  We included all cases in which pancreatic lesions were evaluated by EUS-FNA and a subsequent surgical resection was performed. All patients that met these criteria at HCI between March 1999 and April 2014 were included.  Descriptive variables were calculated by comparing EUS-FNA results to final surgical diagnoses.  The variables used to determine these values were; false positive \u003d PDA by EUS-FNA and negative at resection, true positive \u003d PDA for both, false negative \u003d negative for PDA at EUS-FNA and positive at resection, true negative \u003d negative for both.  We considered atypical cells positive for PDA since their presence mandates aggressive intervention by the treating clinician.  Results:  Of the 242 patients that met the inclusion criterion, 139 were female with an average age of 58 +/- 15 (mean +/- standard deviation) and 103 were male with an average age of 62 +/- 13.  In terms of diagnosing PDA by EUS-FNA we determined the sensitivity 89% (81%-94%; 95% confidence interval), specificity 76% (68%-83%), positive predictive value of 74% (66%-82%), and negative predictive value 89% (82%-94%).  Conclusions:    Although our findings are relatively consistent with the current literature, there is discernible potential for inappropriate treatment of patients based purely on EUS-FNA evaluation.  Limitations of this study are the appraisal at a single institution and the necessity to evaluate only cases that ultimately had surgical resection of the pancreatic lesion.","title":"Accuracy of diagnosing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by EUS-FNA at a single institution.","pubmedId":"ASCO_139857-158"}
