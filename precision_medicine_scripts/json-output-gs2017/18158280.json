A total of 21 BRCA2 6174delT and 8 BRCA1 185delAG mutations were found. Similar frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers were found among Ashkenazi (12.8%) and non-Ashkenazi Jews (9.1%). The combined prevalence of BRCA1/BRCA2 founder mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish men is slightly higher than for women, due to a higher frequency of BRCA2 mutations.","title":"Similar prevalence of founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations among Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi men with breast cancer: evidence from 261 cases in Israel, 1976-1999.","pubmedId":"18158280"}
