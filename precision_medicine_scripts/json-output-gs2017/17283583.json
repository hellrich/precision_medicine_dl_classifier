We aimed to visualize morphological changes in lesions of cutaneous LE using optical coherence tomography (OCT), and to correlate the OCT findings with histopathology. Six patients with CDLE and five patients with SCLE were investigated. Prior to skin biopsy, OCT assessment was performed on previously marked lesions. The images of OCT and corresponding histology were evaluated side-by-side on the PC screen. The thickening and disruption of the entrance signal in OCT images correlated with the hyperkeratosis which was observed in the histological sections. Atrophy of the epidermis, which was demonstrated by histology, could also be detected in the OCT pictures showing a thinned layer below the entrance signals. On OCT, a patchy reduction of reflectivity was observed in the upper dermis corresponding to dense patchy, partly lichenoid, lymphocytic infiltrates and oedema of the upper dermis. Furthermore, OCT images displayed increased signal-free cavities which histopathologically corresponded to dilated vessels in the upper dermis. All OCT parameters studied significantly (P \u003c 0.05) correlated with histopathological features as indicated by coefficients of correlation ranging from 0.55 to 0.94. OCT enables to demonstrate micromorphological changes in cutaneous LE which correlate with histopathological findings. Nevertheless, the current technique does not allow one to visualize definite diagnostic features of cutaneous LE. However, OCT may be a promising method for objective monitoring of LE activity and treatment effects over time in vivo.","title":"Optical coherence tomography of cutaneous lupus erythematosus correlates with histopathology.","pubmedId":"17283583"}
