Retrospective analyses suggest tumours bearing KRAS exon 2 G13D mutations may also derive benefit. Recent data restricts the profile of responders to tumours which are WT for KRAS exons 2, 3 \u0026 4 and NRAS. Retrospective data indicates WT PIK3CA gene may also be needed for response, whilst the predictive value of BRAFmutations is more uncertain.  ICECREAM is a currently recruiting international randomised phase II trial of cetuximab +/- irinotecan in 100 patients with quadruple WT tumours (KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) or with KRAS G13D mutation.   Methods:  Tumour samples were screened at any stage following mCRC diagnosis. Sanger sequencing and SNaPshot analysis (limit of sensitivity 15%, 3%) was performed for KRAS exons 2, 3 \u0026 4, NRAS, BRAF exon 15 and PIK3CA exons 9 \u0026 20.  Results:  Samples from 149 patients were screened for KRAS and 131 of those for the additional genes. Six samples failed technically. 59 of 125 (47%) were WT for all 4 genes. Mutation frequencies were: KRAS exon 2  45; exon 3  3; exon 4 - 1 (49/143 (34%)), NRAS 7/125 (6%), BRAF 13/125 (10%) and PIK3CA exon 9  11; exon 20  5; (16/125 (13%)).  KRAS G13D was identified in 7 cases (5%).  KRAS, NRAS \u0026 BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive whereas PIK3CA mutation frequently co-existed with KRAS mutations.  Of 59 quadruple WT patients, 13 are enrolled on trial, with 27 G13D mutation patients.  Sanger sequencing identified rare or unusual mutations (KRAS Q22K, KRAS V14I, KRAS T74P, BRAF D584G(2), BRAF D584N and PIK3CA M1943I) of uncertain significance in 7 cases (5%); these would be missed by allele-specific methods directed towards common hotspot mutations.  Conclusions:  The mutation frequencies in genes predicting sensitivity to EGFR-I in a trial- eligible community population are similar to those reported in retrospective analyses from large Phase III trials.  Screening for exons rather than hotspot mutations identified rare or unusual mutations of uncertain clinical significance in 5% of patients.
