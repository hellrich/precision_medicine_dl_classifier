Two adolescents with homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) and delayed maturation with behavioral problems developed priapism about one week after receiving an intramuscular injection of testosterone enanthate. Neither had a previous history of priapism. We conclude that testosterone should not be administered to male patients with SCD because of the risk of inducing priapism and possible impotence.","title":"Testosterone induced priapism in two adolescents with sickle cell disease.","pubmedId":"8521195"}
