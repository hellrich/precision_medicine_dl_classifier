We report the case of a woman previously operated on for colon cancer, presenting with symptoms of congestive heart failure due to metastatic invasion of the right ventricular cavity. Both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography were useful in detecting the mass, but not in defining its nature. The patient underwent a palliative surgical resection of the neoplastic mass but died soon after the intervention.","title":"Congestive heart failure secondary to right ventricular metastasis of colon cancer.
