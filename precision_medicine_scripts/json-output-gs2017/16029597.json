Pathological examination was conducted. Immunoprecitipation was used to assay the protein expression and phosphorylation of PTEN, PI3K and Akt (protein kinase B), and protein expression of alpha-skeletal-actin in myocardial tissues.\nTypical myocardial remodeling was shown in the myocardial tissues from the valvular heart disease patients with CHF. Hypertrophy was dominant in the myocardial tissues at early stagy of CHF, the myocardial tissues in the end stage of CHF was characterized by disordered alignment of myocytes, discontinuity and dissolving of cardiac fiber, destroyed subcellular organs, and hyperplasia of interstitial tissue. The protein expression of PTEN [absorbance value (A) ratio of PTEN and beta-actin] in control group was 3.29 +/- 0.11, grade II cardiac function was 2.56 +/- 0.19, grade III was 1.52 +/- 0.35, grade IV was 0.91 +/- 0.10, PTEN protein expressions in CHF groups were lower than that of control group and negatively correlated to the levels of cardiac function (P \u003c 0.05 or 0.01). On the contrary, The phosphorylation of PI3K (PI3K/beta-actin) in control group was 0.21 +/- 0.04, grade II cardiac function was 0.52 +/- 0.09, grade III was 1.12 +/- 0.29, grade IV was 1.62 +/- 0.54; The phosphorylation of Akt (Akt/beta-actin) in control group was 0.75 +/- 0.13, grade II cardiac function was 1.21 +/- 0.34, grade III was 2.45 +/- 0.71, grade IV was 3.55 +/- 0.80; The protein expression of alpha-skeletal-actin (alpha-skeletal-actin/beta-actin) in control group was 0.20 +/- 0.03, grade II cardiac function was 0.41 +/- 0.04, grade III was 0.82 +/- 0.09, grade IV was 1.56 +/- 0.11, their expressions in CHF groups were higher than that of control group and positively correlated to the levels of cardiac function (P \u003c 0.05 or 0.01).\nBoth the PTEN and PI3K signal pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial remodeling in CHF patients with valvular heart disease, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of myocardial hypertrophy. PTEN may play a negative regulation role in the process of myocardial remodeling.","title":"[PTEN/PI3K pathways are involved in the signal transduction of myocardial remodeling in patients with congestive heart failure].","pubmedId":"16029597"}
