The expression of EGFR, Ki-67, bcl-2, p53 in the lung adenocarcinomas was studied in relation to the type of EGFR mutation. Lung adenocarcinomas harboring the EGFR L858R mutation in exon 21 have a less proliferative activity than those with EGFR mutation in exon 19 and in those without EGFR mutation. The p53 protein expression was higher in a group of adenocarcinomas having the EGFR L858R mutation than in that of adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutation in exon 19. There was no bcl-2 expression in adenocarcinomas showing the EGFR mutation.","title":"[The specific features of the expression of molecular biological markers for proliferation and apoptosis in patients with lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation].","pubmedId":"20131498"}
