A known adverse effect of trastuzumab use is cardiac dysfunction, which can often be reversed with cessation of therapy. Our objectives were to 1) assess if trastuzumab can be safely administered to breast cancer patients with reduced cardiac function and 2) identify patient characteristics that predict susceptibility to trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on female patients seen at Mayo Clinic for HER2+ breast cancer and treated with trastuzumab for localized or metastatic disease between January 1, 2000 and August 31, 2015. Eligibility criteria included documentation of and results from at least one echocardiogram prior to and at least one after trastuzumab initiation. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) of 53% or more was considered normal. Any LVEF reduction of 10% or more was considered significant. Among patients with normal EF, age strata of \u003c 45, 45-60, and \u003e 60 at time of trastuzumab initiation were used to assess risk factors for clinically diagnosed cardiac dysfunction (defined as EF \u003c 53 or abnormal strain and physical symptoms of heart failure (HF)). Results: We identified 335 women (mean age 53.3, with 25.3% age \u003c 45, 44.5% age 45-60, and 30.1% age \u003e 60) who had normal LVEF (median EF 64, range: 53-75) and 23 women (mean age 53.4, with 30.4% age \u003c 45, 43.5% age 45-60, and 26.1% age \u003e 60) who had low LVEF at baseline (median EF 52, range: 25-52). Approximately a third (34.3%) of women with normal LVEF prior to initiation of therapy had at least one subsequent echocardiogram showing a drop of 10% or a low LVEF ( \u003c 53). Approximately a quarter (26%) of women with low LVEF at baseline had a 10% drop in LVEF. HF incidence increased with age. Predictive factors for trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction were obesity and history of coronary artery disease (CAD) across all age strata, and chest irradiation (IR) for those aged 45-60 only. Conclusions: Our results suggest that trastuzumab can be administered in women with reduced cardiac function at no greater risk than in those with preserved cardiac function. Some women with no obesity, history of CAD, or history of chest IR may not need echocardiograms during trastuzumab therapy.","title":"Safety of trastuzumab in women with HER2+ breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_194423-199"}
