To assess the diagnostic usefulness of denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC) in this setting, we performed DHPLC and DNA sequencing to study exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of c-KIT and exons 12 and 18 of PDGFRA in 54 consecutive cases of GIST collected from a single population. Most (40/54 [74%]) carried c-KIT mutations, and 7 (13%) carried PDGFRA mutations. These results were similar to those described in the literature. It is important to note that DHPLC was found to be highly sensitive, detecting all of the mutations in these 6 exons that were identified by DNA sequencing. Our data suggest that DHPLC is a cost-effective, rapid, and sensitive test for screening for mutations of c-KIT and PDGFRA in GISTs.","title":"Detection of c-KIT and PDGFRA gene mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors: comparison of DHPLC and DNA sequencing methods using a single population-based cohort.","pubmedId":"20023271"}
