In metastatic setting, median overall survival, even with modern chemotherapy regimens, generally does not exceed 1 year and toxicity is a major concern. Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, and VEGF is one of the most important mediators of this process. Ramucirumab, an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody, has been recently evaluated in the large Phase III REGARD trial, demonstrating a significant survival benefit in second-line treatment of patients with advanced gastric or gastro-eosophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, treatment with ramucirumab was associated with very few toxic effects. This article will review the main findings of the REGARD trial and discuss their potential impact on future treatment of metastatic gastric cancer.
