Intracellular localization of individual isoenzymes of NOS was detected in normal gastric mucosa. Gastric cancer tissues had a marked reduction of all three NOS isoforms expression. The expression of the endothelial NOS, neuronal NOS and inducible NOS in the tumor tissue was significantly lower than in normal gastric mucosa (P \u003d 0.01, P \u003d 0.02, P \u003c 0.01, respectively). In the tumor tissue the expression of inducible NOS was significantly lower than the expression of both constitutive forms of NOS (P \u003c 0.01). There was a tendency to higher expression of both constitutive forms of NOS in earlier stages T2 of the tumor compared to advanced T4 tumor. In contrast, the expression of inducible NOS was higher than in the advanced T4 tumor than in the earlier stages T2 of the tumor. The mapping of the expression of endothelial NOS, neuronal NOS and inducible NOS in human stomach showed higher expression of NOS isoforms in the distal third than in the proximal third of the stomach (P \u003d 0.03, P \u003d 0.04, P \u003d 0.01, respectively). We conclude that there is greater expression of NOS in the stomach corpus and in antrum than in the proximal third of the normal human stomach mirroring the anatomical predilection of common pathological changes in this part of the human stomach. Furthermore, there was loss of the expression of individual isoenzymes in gastric neoplasms.","title":"Expression of differential nitric oxide synthase isoforms in human normal gastric mucosa and gastric cancer tissue.","pubmedId":"9328184"}
