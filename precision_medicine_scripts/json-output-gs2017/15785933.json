MGMT protein was expressed in 10% of non-neoplastic cervices, but significantly increased in SCC (42.5%) and adenocarcinoma (70.0%). The protein expression of p16 INK4A and MGMT was not related to their gene promoter methylation status.\nThe hypermethylation of p16 INK4A and MGMT genes in the uterine cervix may indicate the presence of malignant cells, and p16 INK4A immunostaining is useful in grading CIN and diagnosing invasive SCC and adenocarcinoma.","title":"The hypermethylation and protein expression of p16 INK4A and DNA repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in various uterine cervical lesions.","pubmedId":"15785933"}
