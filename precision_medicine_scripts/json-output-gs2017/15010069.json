In this study, GISTs from 37 patients enrolled in an European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) phase I/II clinical study of imatinib were examined for mutations of c-KIT/PDGFRA in order to explore whether the mutational status of the tumour predicts the clinical response to therapy. Mutations were screened by denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and characterised by bi-directional DNA sequencing. Activating mutations of c-KIT or PDGFRA were found in 29 (78%) and 2 (6%) GISTs, respectively. Most c-KIT mutations involved exon 11 (n\u003d24; 83%), all but one being an in-frame deletion; no isolated point mutations were found. The other c-KIT mutations included exon 9 AY 502-503 duplication (n\u003d4; 14%) and exon 13 Lys--\u003eGlu(642) missense mutation (n\u003d1; 3%). Two tumours with no detectable c-KIT mutations demonstrated PDGFRA Asp--\u003eGlu(842) amino acid substitutions. Patients with GISTs harbouring exon 11 mutations were more likely to achieve a partial response (PR) on imatinib therapy (83%) than all of the others (23%). The overall survival and progression-free survival rates for the entire group at 106 weeks were 78.3% and 46.9%, respectively. Based on a Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with GISTs harbouring c-KIT mutations had longer median survival times and were less likely to progress than the other patients. These findings indicate that the mutational status of the c-KIT/PDGFRA oncoproteins could be useful to predict the clinical response of patients imatinib therapy.","title":"Use of c-KIT/PDGFRA mutational analysis to predict the clinical response to imatinib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours entered on phase I and II studies of the EORTC Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group.","pubmedId":"15010069"}
