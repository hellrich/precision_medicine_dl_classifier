Small cell lung cancer is highly sensitive to first-line chemotherapy, but most of the patients relapse after the first-line therapy quickly. Despitemany clinical researchof chemotherapy, biological agents and molecular targeting agents since the 1980s, there still remains a substantial lack of consensus regarding the appropriate therapeutic management on maintenance therapy of small cell lung cancer. The review focuses on maintenance therapy of small cell lung cancer. \n肺癌是世界上最常见的恶性肿瘤之一，其中小细胞肺癌发生率约15%。小细胞肺癌对一线化疗高度敏感，但多数患者在一线治疗缓解后很快出现复发进展，因此，自20世纪80年代起已开展不少小细胞肺癌维持治疗的相关临床研究，涉及到化疗药物、生物制剂及分子靶向药物。但其结果仍存在争论，现对该方面内容综述如下。.","title":"[Research Progression of Maintenance Therapy in Small Cell Lung Cancer].","pubmedId":"26383980"}
