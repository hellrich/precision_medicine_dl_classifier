The administration of certain types of chemotherapy may put breast cancer survivors at risk for late effect drug-induced congestive heart failure (CHF). This case study discusses the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of drug-induced CHF in a woman with breast cancer. Discussions of risk factors and secondary and tertiary prevention of CHF caused by anthracycline chemotherapy agents are also included. Recognition of risk factors and symptoms of CHF is essential to minimize the morbidity and mortality that accompanies cardiac failure and is an important part of the comprehensive care of breast cancer patients. Because drug-induced CHF can occur years after the administration of the offending drug, primary care providers need to be aware of the risk of this disorder among breast cancer survivors under their care.","title":"Drug-induced congestive heart failure in breast cancer survivors.","pubmedId":"11381352"}
