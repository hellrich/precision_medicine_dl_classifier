Abnormalities of one or more of five proto-oncogenes were found in fifty-eight percent of tumors at the time of mastectomy. Amplification of c-myc and c-erbB-2, and allelic deletions of c-ras-Ha and c-myb were the most common abnormalities. The presence of altered proto-oncogenes correlated with clinical stage of the cancers. Fifteen of 43 evaluable tumors of stages I to III recurred, and four of five evaluable stage IV tumors progressed within 16 to 24 months of surgery. All but one of the cancers that recurred or progressed had detectably altered proto-oncogenes (P less than .001). Analysis of proto-oncogenes may have prognostic value in breast cancer.","title":"Proto-oncogene abnormalities in human breast cancer: correlations with anatomic features and clinical course of disease.","pubmedId":"3474361"}
