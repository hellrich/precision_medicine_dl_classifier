To test this, we have compared human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cell lines carrying the KRAS(V12) mutation, knockdown of TP53 or both with parental HBEC cells.\nVOC from headspace above cultured cells were collected by passive sampling and analysed by thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) or sensor array with discriminant factor analysis (DFA).\nIn TD-GC-MS analysis, individual compounds had limited ability to discriminate between cell lines, but by applying DFA analysis combinations of 20 VOCs successfully discriminated between all cell types (accuracies 80-100%, with leave-one-out cross validation). Sensor array detection DFA demonstrated the ability to discriminate samples based on their cell type for all comparisons with accuracies varying between 77% and 93%.\nOur results demonstrate that minimal genetic changes in bronchial airway cells lead to detectable differences in levels of specific VOCs identified by TD-GC-MS or of patterns of VOCs identified by sensor array output. From the clinical aspect, these results suggest the possibility of breath analysis for detection of minimal genetic changes for earlier diagnosis or for genetic typing of lung cancers.","title":"Unique volatolomic signatures of TP53 and KRAS in lung cells.","pubmedId":"25051409"}
