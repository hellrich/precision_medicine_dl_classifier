Forty patients with uveal melanoma were included in the study. Clinicopathological parameters were evaluated with hematoxylin-eosin staining. HGF, c-Met, EGFR, and IGF-1R expressions were evaluated immunohistochemically. HGF, EGF, and IGF-1 levels were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in vitreous and serum specimens taken at enucleation and 6 months after the enucleation. HGF, c-Met, IGF-1R, and EGFR expressions were detected in 57.5, 20, 20, and 12.5% of cases, respectively. IGF-1R expression was significantly correlated with the degree of pigmentation, necrosis, and lymphocyte infiltration (P\u003d0.013, 0.04, and 0.017). EGFR expression was significantly correlated with the mitosis rate (P\u003d0.02). Vitreal EGF and serum IGF-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with scleral invasion (15.72+/-29.13, 199.01+/-154.01 pg/ml, respectively) when compared with the patients without invasion (0.56+/-1.05, 33.01+/-36.52 pg/ml) (P\u003d0.03 and 0.015). When the preoperative and postoperative serum growth factor levels were compared, the serum EGF level was found to be lower (125.93+/-62.84, 100.02+/-31.19 pg/ml, P\u003d0.007) and the serum IGF-1 level (165.81+/-153.6, 301.35+/-131.24 pg/ml, P\u003c0.001) was found to be higher in the postoperative 6-month specimens. Uveal melanomas express HGF, c-Met, EGFR, and IGF-1R. Vitreal growth factor levels and expression of EGFR and IGF-1R are correlated with some clinicopathological parameters. IGF-1 and EGF may have a role in the development and progression of uveal melanoma.","title":"Correlation of clinicopathological parameters with HGF, c-Met, EGFR, and IGF-1R expression in uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"20061986"}
