Nevertheless, a significant subgroup of patients develops tumour recurrence. Currently, there are no clinically established biomarkers available to identify this patient group. We applied reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) for phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase pathway activation mapping to stratify patients according to their risk of tumour recurrence after surgery.\nFull-length proteins were extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 118 patients who underwent curative resection. RPPA technology was used to analyse expression and/or phosphorylation levels of six major factors of the phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase pathway. Oncogenic mutations of KRAS and BRAF, and DNA microsatellite status, currently discussed as prognostic markers, were analysed in parallel.\nExpression of phospho-AKT (HR\u003d3.52; P\u003d0.032), S6RP (HR\u003d6.3; P\u003d0.044), and phospho-4E-BP1 (HR\u003d4.12; P\u003d0.011) were prognostic factors for disease-free survival. None of the molecular genetic alterations were significantly associated with prognosis.\nOur data indicate that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway evidenced on the protein level might be a valuable prognostic marker to stratify patients for their risk of tumour recurrence. Beside adjuvant chemotherapy targeting of upregulated PI3K/AKT signalling may be an attractive strategy for treatment of high-risk patients.","title":"Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway correlates with prognosis in stage II colon cancer.","pubmedId":"24619078"}
