We determined that the t(1;9) fused ABL to SFPQ (also known as PSF), a gene mapping to 1p34 that encodes a polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor. The t(8;12) fused CPSF6, a cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor, to FGFR1. The fusions were confirmed by amplification of the genomic breakpoints and RT-PCR. The predicted oncogenic products of these fusions, SFPQ-ABL and CPSF6-FGFR1, are in-frame and encode the N-terminal domain of the partner protein and the entire tyrosine kinase domain and C-terminal sequences of ABL and FGFR1. SFPQ interacts with two FGFR1 fusion partners, ZNF198 and CPSF6, that are functionally related to the recurrent PDGFRalpha partner FIP1L1. Our findings thus identify a group of proteins that are important for pre-mRNA processing as fusion partners for tyrosine kinases in hematological malignancies.","title":"The t(1;9)(p34;q34) and t(8;12)(p11;q15) fuse pre-mRNA processing proteins SFPQ (PSF) and CPSF6 to ABL and FGFR1.","pubmedId":"18205209"}
