To explore the mutation frequencies of BRAF(V600E) (V-raf murine sarcoma virus oncogene homolog B1) and NRAS (neuroblastoma ras viral oncogene homolog) codon 61 in CMNs of Chinese, we selected 55 paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, including 37 cases of medium CMNs (1.5-20cm) and 18 cases of giant CMNs (\u003e20 cm). Direct sequencing was performed to detect the BRAF(V600E) and NRAS codon 61 mutations. The BRAF(V600E) mutations were detected in 9 of 55 nevi (16.4%). In medium CMNs, 9 of 37 BRAF(V600E) mutations (24.3%) were detected. Notably, in giant CMNs, no BRAF(V600E) mutations were found. The difference between these frequencies is statistically significant (P \u003d 0.0231). NRAS codon 61 mutations were detected in 13 of 55 nevi (23.6%), including 10 of 37 medium CMNs (27.0%) and 3 of 18 giant CMNs (16.7%). Additionally, the BRAF(V600E) and NRAS codon 61 mutations did not coexist in the same sample. Finally, we found that the NRAS codon 61 mutation was significantly related to the amount of sun exposure (0 of 18 CMNs from sites of intermittent sun exposure and 13 of 36 CMNs from sites of chronic continuous sun exposure, P \u003d 0.0024). The paradoxically higher incidence of BRAF(V600E) mutations in medium-sized compared with giant CMNs suggests that the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation may play different roles between medium and giant CMNs in melanocytic tumorigenesis.","title":"Lack of BRAF(V600E) mutations in giant congenital melanocytic nevi in a Chinese population.","pubmedId":"21430505"}
