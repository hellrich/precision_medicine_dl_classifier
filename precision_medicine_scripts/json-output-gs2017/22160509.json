Gain-of-function somatic mutations of the KIT or PDGFRA genes represent the most prevalent molecular alterations in GISTs. In Carney-Stratakis dyad, patients portray germline mutations of the succinate dehydrogenase subunits B (SDHB), C (SDHC) and D (SDHD) and develop multifocal GISTs and multicentric paragangliomas (PGLs). We herein report a novel germline SDHB mutation (c.T282A--Ile44Asn) occurring in a 26 years-old patient diagnosed with a spindle cell intermediate risk GIST that did not present KIT/PDGFRA/BRAF gene mutations. Further analyses revealed loss of the wild-type SDHB allele and complete loss of SDHB expression in the tumor tissue. After genetic screening of other family members, we detected in the patient\u0027s mother a SDHB mutation without any clinical/laboratorial evidence of GIST or PGL. Altogether, our findings (germline SDHB mutation with absence of PGL in the index case and of GIST and/or PGL in his mother) raise the possibility that this familiar setting corresponds to an incomplete phenotype of the Carney-Stratakis dyad.","title":"A novel germline SDHB mutation in a gastrointestinal stromal tumor patient without bona fide features of the Carney-Stratakis dyad.","pubmedId":"22160509"}
