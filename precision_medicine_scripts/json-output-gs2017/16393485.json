Elderly women have frequently been under-treated and have been poorly represented in clinical breast cancer trials. We reviewed the literature on early breast cancer in older women. We present current information on the tumor biology of elderly women and the role of surgical therapy and adjuvant treatment with hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, biologic agents, and radiation therapy in its management. Lastly, we discuss the importance of clinical trials in the elderly and future directions for therapy.","title":"Update in medical oncology for older patients: focus on breast cancer: management of early breast cancer.","pubmedId":"16393485"}
