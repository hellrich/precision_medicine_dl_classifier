Oligonucleotides encompassing the three codons were amplified by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then examined for point mutation by the selective oligonucleotide hybridization technique. Point mutation was detected in three of the 7 adenomas (43%) and three of the 35 carcinomas (9%). All the gastric adenomas showed the histology of tubular adenoma, being very similar to that of colonic adenoma. The 35 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma were classified into 17 cases of differentiated type and 18 cases of undifferentiated type including signet-ring cell carcinoma. The point mutation of c-Ki-ras oncogene was detected only in the differentiated type (3/17, 18%), and there was no case with point mutation in the undifferentiated type. These results suggest that the genetic mechanism of carcinogenesis differs between the differentiated type and the undifferentiated type of gastric adenocarcinoma, and also that c-Ki-ras activation is possibly involved in a relatively early step of the \"adenoma-carcinoma sequence,\" which leads to the development of a portion of differentiated adenocarcinomas in the stomach.","title":"Point mutation of c-Ki-ras oncogene in gastric adenoma and adenocarcinoma with tubular differentiation.","pubmedId":"1902452"}
