This is complemented by interventional endoscopy aiming to treat obstructive jaundice and/or gastric or duodenal obstruction by implantation of endoprostheses. Pain therapy is standardized for the most part according to the WHO guidelines; nutrition of the cancer patient, however, is sometimes disregarded. For palliative chemotherapy, 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine can be recommended. Combinations thereof with other cytostatic drugs or radiation are subject to ongoing studies. A variety of novel therapeutic concepts, e.g. immunomodulation or suicide gene therapy, have demonstrated good effects in animal studies. Unfortunately, very few of these have entered clinical studies (phase I and phase II). This will be the focus of future research in this field.","title":"[Palliative therapy of pancreatic adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"11253511"}
