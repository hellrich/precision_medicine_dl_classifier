A deeper knowledge of the biology of cancer later resulted in important changes in its treatment, such as the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, administered prior to surgical treatment, as an alternative therapy. Initially described by the University of Milan, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has proven to be a better alternative than surgical treatment alone, adjuvant (or post-surgical) chemotherapy and radiotherapy alone or in combination with the previously mentioned techniques. Among its advantages we find an increase in the rate of breast-conserving surgeries and a reduction in the ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate. Furthermore, it facilitates breast cancer control and follow-up. On the other hand, its main disadvantage is that it cannot modify some of the disease\u0027s prognostic factors, such as the tumor breast relation, multicentric disease, scattered microcalcifications and the coexistence of medical elements which contraindicate radiation therapy. Currently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a pillar of the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer and is recommended in order to guarantee a more conservative evolution of the disease.","title":"[Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer].","pubmedId":"23612817"}
