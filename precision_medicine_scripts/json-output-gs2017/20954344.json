The most recent paper from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) confirmed that introduction of population-based screening for prostate cancer could lead decrease in the mortality rate of prostate cancer. Establishing an optimal screening system, which minimizes underdetection, undertreatment, overdetection, overtreatment, loss of QOL due to treatment would make PSA screening be more useful. It is very important to provide PSA-based screening in Japan using the fact sheets provided by the Japanese Urological Association.","title":"[Screening for prostate cancer].","pubmedId":"20954344"}
