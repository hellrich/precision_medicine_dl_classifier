Obesity is an established risk factor for arthritis; however, the relationship between arthritis and obesity has not been well characterized at the population level in Wisconsin.\nDescribe the relationship between arthritis, obesity, physical inactivity, and efforts to lose weight among Wisconsin adults.\nWisconsin Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2000-2001. Arthritis was defined by either doctor diagnosis or self-reported chronic joint symptoms.\nOverall, 36% of respondents had arthritis. Among adults with arthritis, 28% were obese (BMI\u003e30) compared to 16% without arthritis. The prevalence of leisure time physical inactivity was substantially higher among those with arthritis compared to those without arthritis (27.8% vs. 19.2%). Although prevalence of obesity was higher among those with arthritis, only 46% of adults with arthritis made an effort to lose weight.\nA high proportion of adults with arthritis are obese and are physically inactive, even though studies have shown that weight loss and regular physical activity relieve arthritis symptoms. Efforts should be made to promote weight loss and physical activities among adults with arthritis.","title":"Obesity and physical inactivity among Wisconsin adults with arthritis.","pubmedId":"14711020"}
