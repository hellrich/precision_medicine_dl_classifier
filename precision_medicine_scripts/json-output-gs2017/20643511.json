Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, intraoperative data, pathology data, and patient outcomes were collected and analyzed by adjuvant treatment status and age ≥ 75 years. Cox proportional hazards analysis determined clinical predictors of mortality and morbidity.\nWe identified 166 of 655 (25.3%) patients were ≥ 75 years of age and 489 of 655 patients (74.7%) were \u003c75 years of age. Forty-nine patients in the elderly group (29.5%) received adjuvant CRT. For elderly patients, node-positive metastases (p \u003d 0.008), poor/anaplastic differentiation (p \u003d 0.012), and undergoing a total pancreatectomy (p \u003d 0.010) predicted poor survival. The 2-year survival for elderly patients receiving adjuvant therapy was improved compared with surgery alone (49.0% vs. 31.6%, p \u003d 0.013); however, 5-year survival was similar (11.7% vs. 19.8%, respectively, p \u003d 0.310). After adjusting for major confounders, adjuvant therapy in elderly patients had a protective effect with respect to 2-year survival (relative risk [RR] 0.58, p \u003d 0.044), but not 5-year survival (RR 0.80, p \u003d 0.258). Among the nonelderly, CRT was significantly associated with 2-year survival (RR 0.60, p \u003c 0.001) and 5-year survival (RR 0.69, p \u003c 0.001), after adjusting for confounders.\nAdjuvant therapy after PD is significantly associated with increased 2-year but not 5-year survival in elderly patients. Additional studies are needed to select which elderly patients are likely to benefit from adjuvant CRT.","title":"Adjuvant chemoradiation therapy after pancreaticoduodenectomy in elderly patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20643511"}
