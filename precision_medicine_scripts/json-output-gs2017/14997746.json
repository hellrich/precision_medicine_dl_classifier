New questions, such as the feasibility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in improving breast conserving rate, the appropriateness of breast conservation treatment in ductal carcinoma in situ, the effectiveness of radiation therapy in patients treated by breast conservation, and patient selection for breast conservation without radiation, are now being raised. Future work that needs to be done to answer these questions is discussed in this review.","title":"[Controversies in breast conservation treatment for breast cancer].","pubmedId":"14997746"}
