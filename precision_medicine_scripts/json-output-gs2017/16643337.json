To identify the functions of differential genes in regulating the cell growth of colon cancer, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to block one of these genes in the colon cancer cell line HCT-116.\nExpression changes of greater than twofold in two SAGE libraries of colon cancer compared to two of normal tissue were observed for 216 tags of a total of 195,160 transcript tags (54 up-regulated genes and 136 down-regulated genes). Subsequent analysis of 17 genes by RT-PCR confirmed the reliability of this analysis. RNAi-mediated blockage of one of these genes, transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1, significantly reduced the growth of a colon cancer cell line.\nThe combination of CGAP analysis and RNAi provides an excellent system to rapidly define the specific genes that are up-regulated in cancer to impact the growth of cancer cells. Further study on these differential overexpressed genes may provide gene markers for the detection and treatment of colon cancer.","title":"Analysis of gene expression profile in colon cancer using the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project and RNA interference.","pubmedId":"16643337"}
