Sentinel lymph node dissection was performed and was negative for the presence of melanoma.\nPedunculated melanoma is a rare type of melanoma. Conventional staging methods for melanoma may not be reliable in this type of tumor. Complete workup, possibly including sentinel lymph node dissection, should be performed in all patients with pedunculated melanomas.","title":"Pedunculated malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"10691940"}
