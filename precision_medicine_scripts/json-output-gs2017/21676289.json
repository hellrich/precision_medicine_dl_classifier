The applicability of certain OVs, such as adenoviruses, herpesviruses and reoviruses, for the treatment of pancreatic cancer has been intensively studied for several years, whereas the applicability of other more recently investigated OVs, such as poxviruses and parvoviruses, is only starting to be determined. At the same time, studies have identified key characteristics of pancreatic cancer biology that provide a better understanding of the important factors or pathways involved in this disease. This review aims to summarise the different replication-competent OVs proposed as therapeutics for pancreatic cancer. It also focuses on the unique biology of these viruses that makes them exciting candidate virotherapies for pancreatic cancer and discusses how they could be genetically manipulated or combined with other drugs to improve their efficacy based on what is currently known about the molecular biology of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Oncolytic virotherapy for pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"21676289"}
