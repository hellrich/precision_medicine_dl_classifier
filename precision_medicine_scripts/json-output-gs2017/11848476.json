Transcriptional profiling (Affymetrix Gene Chip Technology) was performed with cell lines derived from the primary tumor and metastatic lesions such as mesentery, liver and lungs. We scored for genes commonly deregulated in the cell lines derived from the metastatic lesions. Of 7070 genes investigated, 59 (0.83%) were found to be deregulated in the cell lines derived from the metastatic lesions. We grouped these genes into different categories such as transcription, translation, cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, chromosome instability, tumor suppressor genes, enzymes and \"others\". The most remarkable features of the system are the up-regulation of high mobility group protein HMG-I (Y), twenty-one ribosomal proteins, GAPDH and the laminin receptor in the cell lines derived from the metastatic lesions, whereas tumor suppressor genes such as maspin and RB1 were down-regulated. Inhibition or reconstitution of the activity of these targets are an emerging strategy for inhibition of metastasis in this system.","title":"Transcriptional profiling of cell lines derived from an orthotopic pancreatic tumor model reveals metastasis-associated genes.","pubmedId":"11848476"}
