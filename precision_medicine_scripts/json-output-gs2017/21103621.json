One of the most recent targets is microtubule-associated human EML4 generating a fusion-type oncogene with ALK demonstrating marked transforming activity in lung cancer. Since EML4 is a poorly characterized protein with regard to expression, function and regulation in human tissue, specimens of human tumor and tumor-free tissues obtained from patients with NSCLC were analyzed to determine the cellular localization. All tissue samples have been previously fixed with the novel HOPE-technique and paraffin embedded. Determination of both gene expression and protein levels of EML4 were performed using RT-PCR, in situ hybridization as well as immunohistochemistry, respectively. In human NSCLC tissue samples, possible regulation of EML4 transcription upon chemotherapy with combinations of most established cytotoxic drugs for NSCLC treatment was also studied employing the recently established ex vivo tissue culture model STST. In normal lung, both marked mRNA and protein levels of EML4 were localized in alveolar macrophages. In contrast, lung tumor tissues always showed consistent transcriptional expression in situ and by RT-PCR. Stimulation of NSCLC tissues with chemotherapeutics revealed heterogeneous effects on EML4 mRNA levels. Based on its expression patterns in both tumor-free lung and NSCLC tissues, human EML4 is likely to be closely associated with processes involved in local inflammation of the lung as well as with tumor behavior. Thus, our results suggest that EML4 may have the potential as a therapeutic target molecule in NSCLC chemotherapy.","title":"Expression analysis of EML4 in normal lung tissue and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the absence and presence of chemotherapeutics.","pubmedId":"21103621"}
