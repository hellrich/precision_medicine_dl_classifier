FGF-19 is a high affinity, heparin dependent ligand for FGFR4 and is the first member of the FGF family to show exclusive binding to FGFR4. Human FGF-19 maps to chromosome 11 q13.1, a region associated with an osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome of skeletal and retinal defects. FGF-19 message is expressed in several tissues including fetal cartilage, skin, and retina, as well as adult gall bladder and is overexpressed in a colon adenocarcinoma cell line.","title":"FGF-19, a novel fibroblast growth factor with unique specificity for FGFR4.","pubmedId":"10525310"}
