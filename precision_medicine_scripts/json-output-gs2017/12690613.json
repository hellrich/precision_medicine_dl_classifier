This article focuses on disease presentation, treatment options, quality of life, and the nurse\u0027s unique role in caring for this patient population. Surgical resection is the only treatment modality that offers a potential cure and prolonged survival. In patients with unresectable disease, biliary bypass or nonoperative biliary drainage procedures can provide palliation. Other palliative treatment modalities include chemotherapy, radiation, and photodynamic therapy. The sudden onset, limited treatment options, and overall poor prognosis add to the challenge of caring for patients with CC.","title":"Cholangiocarcinoma: a nursing perspective.","pubmedId":"12690613"}
