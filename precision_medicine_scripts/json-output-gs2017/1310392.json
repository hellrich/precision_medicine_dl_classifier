As a result, one transcript, the size of which was 1.2 kb was shown in all cell lines and tissues examined. An increased level of mRNA was demonstrated in cell lines which proliferated rapidly and in small cell lung cancer cell lines. It was also indicated that gene expression of the laminin receptor was up-regulated especially in small cell lung cancer tissue. In this context, 67kDa-laminin receptor appears to be a marker for biological aggressiveness of human lung cancer.","title":"Increased expression of the 67kDa-laminin receptor gene in human small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"1310392"}
