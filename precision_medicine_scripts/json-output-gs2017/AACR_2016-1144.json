In ALK-rearranged NSCLC, the growth of tumors is strongly addicted to ALK activity, and suppression of ALK is a potent therapeutic strategy. To date, 6 known fusion partners of ALK onco-kinase have been reported in NSCLC, although the sensitivity to ALK inhibitor according to fusion variant except for EML4-ALK is still unclear. In this study, we reviewed clinical trial samples analyzed by comprehensive genomic profiling approach to detect unknown actionable ALK rearrangements.Materials and methods: We reviewed gene alteration and expression profile of clinical samples in preliminary molecular studies from the ongoing BATTLE-2, phase II clinical trial of targeted drugs in chemo-refractory NSCLC.Results: In 187 NSCLC samples, 3 samples harbored ALK fusion gene: 2 EML4-ALK and 1 novel ALK fusion variant PRKAR1A-ALK in a lung adenocarcinoma of male former smoker patient. The ALK gene expression levels of ALK-rearranged samples were significantly higher compared to other samples. Interestingly, the patient harboring PRKAR1A-ALK was treated with ALK inhibitor crizotinib and showed long time stable disease.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PRKAR1A-ALK fusion could be a novel oncogenic driver in lung adenocarcinoma and an indicator of ALK inhibitor response.
