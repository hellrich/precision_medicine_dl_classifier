Patients with PJS have increased risk for gastrointestinal, breast, and female genital tract cancers.\nMultiple genital tract cancers in a 34-year-old woman with PJS are described. The patient, who was admitted to our department with severe vaginal bleeding, was performed right salpingo-oophorectomy because of pure gonadoblastoma in 1996. In 2003, concomitant to cervical carcinoma, breast cancer was diagnosed. Patient underwent left modified radical mastectomy due to the invasive papillary carcinoma. The patient received six cycles combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy because of stage IIIB cervical cancer.\nThis is the first case report presenting PJS associated with multiple genital tract tumors including ovarian gonadoblastoma in literature. The clinical significance of these tumors in PJS patients has been reviewed.","title":"Breast cancer, ovarian gonadoblastoma and cervical cancer in a patient with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome.","pubmedId":"18193442"}
