The expression of immunocompetent cell-associated markers in 22 pancreatic cancer specimens was characterized by immunohistochemistry. The impact of pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1 and BxPC-3) on the differentiation and migration of human U937 monocytes and the effect of U937-derived macrophages on the proliferation and invasion of PANC-1 and BxPC-3 were determined by transwell assays. The potential effect on U937-derived macrophages or on the behaviors of pancreatic cancer cells following coculture in a transwell system was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The high levels of macrophage-related CD68 and CD163 expression were detected in the pancreatic cancer specimens. Pancreatic cancer cells promoted the differentiation of U937 cells and migration of U937-derived macrophages, but decreased the mRNA transcripts of macrophage polarization-related genes of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12p40, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and CD163, particularly for iNOS. Furthermore, U937-derived M2 macrophages inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, but promoted their invasion. Coculture of pancreatic cancer cells with U937-derived macrophages upregulated the mRNA expression of genes associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, angiogenesis, and stemness of pancreatic cancer, but downregulated the expression of E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer cells. The interaction between pancreatic cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages may play a pivotal role in the progression of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Interaction between pancreatic cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages promotes the invasion of pancreatic cancer cells and the differentiation and migration of macrophages.","pubmedId":"25557640"}
