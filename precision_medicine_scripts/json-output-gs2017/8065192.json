Herein we describe a 38-year-old man who had dyspnea on exertion and chest pain. Computed tomography of the chest revealed a large mass in the right pleural cavity. Thoracotomy was performed, and the patient recovered with no complications. Postoperative adjuvant irradiation was successful. In addition to the current case, we review the previously reported cases of pleural liposarcomas and discuss the treatment outcomes.","title":"Liposarcoma of the pleura.","pubmedId":"8065192"}
