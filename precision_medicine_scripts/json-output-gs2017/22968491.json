However, cyclothymic disorder in children is rarely researched, or often subsumed in an \"NOS\" category. The present study tests the replicability of findings from an earlier study, and expands on the criterion validity of cyclothymic disorder in youth. Using the Robins and Guze (1970) framework we examined the validity of cyclothymic disorder as a subtype of BP. Using a youth (ages 5-17) outpatient clinical sample (N \u003d 894), participants with cyclothymic disorder (n \u003d 53) were compared to participants with other BP spectrum disorders (n \u003d 399) and to participants with non-bipolar disorders (n \u003d 442). Analyses tested differences in youth with cyclothymic disorder and bipolar disorder not otherwise specified who do, and those who do not, have a parent with BP. Compared to youth with non-bipolar disorders, youth with cyclothymic disorder had higher irritability (p \u003c 0.001), more comorbidity (p \u003c 0.001), greater sleep disturbance (p \u003c 0.005), and were more likely to have a family history of BP (p \u003c 0.001). Cyclothymic disorder was associated with a younger age of onset compared to depression (p \u003c 0.001) and bipolar II (p \u003d 0.05). Parental BP status was not significantly associated with any variables. Results support that cyclothymic disorder belongs on the bipolar spectrum. Epidemiological studies indicate that cyclothymic disorder is not uncommon and involves significant impairment. Failing to differentiate between cyclothymic disorder and bipolar NOS limits our knowledge about a significant proportion of cases of bipolarity.","title":"Examining the validity of cyclothymic disorder in a youth sample: replication and extension.","pubmedId":"22968491"}
