Instead of estrogen receptor, ERBB2 and ERBB3 genes were activated by BCAR4 in tamoxifen resistant cells. Recently, the function of BCAR4 as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) was reported to regulate a non-canonical Hedgehog/GLI2 pathway in breast cancer. However, the association of BCAR4 and lung cancer has not been identified. Here, we describe the oncogenic effect of BCAR4 in human lung cancer. Expression pattern of BCAR4 was examined in lung cancer cell lines, primary tumor tissues, and adjacent normal tissues. BCAR4 was highly expressed in 71% of lung cancer cell lines and especially in 43% of cancer tissues of lung adenocarcinoma patients who did not harbor the activational mutations of EGFR nor KRAS. Exogenous expression of BCAR4 protein promoted cell growth of non-tumorigenic bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, and lung cancer cell line, NCI-H1299. We also confirmed the oncogenic feature of BCAR4 by colony forming assay using stably expressing cells. These effects were notably reduced after knockdown of BCAR4 by small interfering RNA. BCAR4 encoded a functional protein and its overexpression resulted in the enhanced migration than controls cells. This result proposed a similar role of BCAR4 in lung cancer considering its previously reported role in breast cancer metastasis. We also detected a fusion gene of BCAR4 in a lung cancer tissue by analyzing RNA-sequencing data. BCAR4 protein as well as its fusion form showed the improved tumorigenic feature in the mouse xenograft model with lung cancer cells. We compared the gene expression pattern in BCAR4 overexpressed cells to identify the possible mechanism of the oncogenic effect of BCAR4. Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, and MMP1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased after BCAR4 overexpression. However, downstream genes of GLI2 signaling were not altered by protein expression of BCAR4 arguing an alternative role for lncRNA BCAR4. Our results suggest a novel oncogenic role of BCAR4 protein in lung cancer.","title":"Breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 4 (BCAR4) is a novel oncogene in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-3137"}
