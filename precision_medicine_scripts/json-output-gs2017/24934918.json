When we used the apoptosis inducer staurosporine, the necrosis inducer 3-bromopyruvate and the autophagy inducer resveratrol to induce cell death in SKMEL28 melanoma cells, Raman spectroscopy clearly distinguished between these three types of cell death, as confirmed by immunoblotting. Finally, the technique could discriminate between different melanoma cell lines according to their susceptibility to high-dose ascorbate.\nRaman spectroscopy is a powerful noninvasive tool to distinguish between melanocytes and melanoma cells, to analyze the specific type of cell death in melanoma cells, and to predict the susceptibility of melanoma cells to anticancer drugs.","title":"Raman spectroscopy as an analytical tool for melanoma research.","pubmedId":"24934918"}
