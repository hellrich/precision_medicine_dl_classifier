Chemoprevention, immuno-regulation, and metastasis are prospective targets by which apoptotic mechanisms could be utilized in the prevention and management of tumorigenesis. Understanding how defects in the death receptor pathway of apoptosis permit colon cancer cells to escape the immune system would allow for treatment options whereby the body\u0027s immune system could again recognize and eliminate unwanted cells.","title":"Colon cancer and apoptosis.","pubmedId":"16531147"}
