We report primary results from a fully enrolled, ongoing phase 2 study (NCT02289833) of pts with previously treated HER2-overexpressing mNSCLC who received single-agent T-DM1. Methods: Eligible pts had HER2-overexpressing mNSCLC and were previously treated with platinum-based therapy. Pts received T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks and were analyzed in 2 cohorts based on centrally determined HER2 status (immunohistochemistry [IHC]2+ vs IHC3+ [10% cells stained with 2+ or 3+ intensity, respectively]). HER2 amplification was assessed via ISH (HER2 gene ratio 2.0). The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR; proportion of pts with confirmed [4 weeks] complete or partial response per RECIST v1.1). Results: The clinical cutoff date for this analysis was Oct 26, 2016.Of 393 screened pts, 102 (27%) were IHC2+ and 29 (7%) were IHC3+. In total, 49 pts (IHC2+, n \u003d 29; IHC3+, n \u003d 20) received T-DM1. At cutoff, median follow-up was 16.3 (range 0.9*22.4; * \u003d censored observation) months. No IHC2+ pt had a response (0%, 95% CI 011.9); 4 IHC3+ pts had partial responses (20%, 95% CI 5.743.7) with a median duration of response of 7.3 (range 2.98.3) months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) in IHC2+ and IHC3+ pts was 2.6 (95% CI 1.42.8) and 2.7 (95% CI 1.48.3) months, respectively. At 6 months after start of study treatment, 9 pts (IHC2+, n \u003d 4; IHC3+, n \u003d 5) were still at risk for a PFS event. Median overall survival was 12.2 (95% CI 3.8not estimable [NE]) months in IHC2+ pts and 12.1 (95% CI 9.3NE) months in IHC3+ pts. Of 16 pts with HER2 amplification (IHC2+, n \u003d 5; IHC3+, n \u003d 11), 3 responded, all in the IHC3+ cohort (27.3%, 95% CI 6.061.0). Eleven pts (22%) experienced a grade 34 adverse event, with fatigue and dyspnea being the only events reported in \u003e 1 pt (n \u003d 2 each). Conclusions: This is the first study to report on the clinical activity of T-DM1 in HER2-overexpressing mNSCLC. Objective responses were observed in IHC3+ pts. Additional molecular analyses are underway to refine markers for optimal pt selection.
