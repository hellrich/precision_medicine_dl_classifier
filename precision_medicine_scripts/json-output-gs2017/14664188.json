This neoplasm has a remarkable tendency to recurrence after surgical excision, rarely to metastasize. Recurrence usually shows a more aggressive behaviour than primitive disease with a higher tendency to penetrate into adjacent organs. The symptomatology often appears late and the first sign is frequently a palpable abdominal mass. Preoperative study involves using CT and MRI. The surgical resection is the only tool able to modify natural history with regard to survival and local recurrence. Prognosis is severe, with a survival of 5 years, variable from 12 to 50% in the different series. A very important prognostic factor is the degree of tumour and radical surgical treatment. From 1990 to 2001, 32 operations for malignant retroperitoneal tumors were performed by our surgical unit in 19 patients; in 7 of them the tumor was a liposarcoma (4 male and 3 female). Total operations for retroperitoneal liposarcoma were 15, in 4 patients a second operation was performed for recurrence, in 3 a third operation and in 1 a fourth. Eleven cases out of 15 have undergone exeresis of sarcoma. Average survival consisted in 4 years and 2 months. Intraoperative radiotherapy, performed in 3 patients, perhaps is able to offer some advantages in relation to local control of the disease and of the survival. A possible resection of eventual recurrence justifies a early follow up with CT and MRI.","title":"[Retroperitoneal liposarcoma].","pubmedId":"14664188"}
