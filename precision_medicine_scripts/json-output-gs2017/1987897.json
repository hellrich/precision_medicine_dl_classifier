The Ha-ras p21 detected in tumor cells showed a statistically significant association with the non-progressed tumor at the diagnosis and the favourable outcome of the patients. The association of Ha-ras p21 with their clinical outcome was closer than those of N-myc amplification. However, the complementary analyses of both Ha-ras p21 and N-myc gene seemed to provide more precise informations relating the patient\u0027s care.","title":"[Tumor markers--personal experience.
