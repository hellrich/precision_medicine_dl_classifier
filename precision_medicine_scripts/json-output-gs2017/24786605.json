Our objective was to investigate the association of diabetes with survival among pancreatic cancer patients in a prospective cohort-based study where diabetes history was ascertained before pancreatic cancer diagnosis.\nWe evaluated survival by baseline (1993-2001) self-reported diabetes history (n\u003d62) among 504 participants that developed exocrine pancreatic cancer within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, race, smoking, and tumour stage (local, locally advanced, and metastatic).\nThe multivariable-adjusted HR for mortality comparing participants with diabetes to those without was 1.52 (95% CI\u003d1.14-2.04, P-value \u003c0.01). After excluding those diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within 3 years of study enrolment, HR for mortality among those with diabetes was 1.45 (95% CI\u003d1.06-2.00, P-value\u003d0.02).\nUsing prospectively collected data, our findings indicate that diabetes is associated with worse survival among patients with pancreatic cancer.","title":"Diabetes and pancreatic cancer survival: a prospective cohort-based study.","pubmedId":"24786605"}
