In this study, we showed that GSK-3β was aberrantly activated in pancreatic cancer. GSK-3β knockdown resulted in arrested proliferation and increased apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Expression of Bcl-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) decreased significantly in a GSK-3β knockdown group. In a xenograft tumor model, GSK-3β knockdown inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis. Our study showed that GSK-3β may become a promising therapeutic target for human pancreatic cancer.","title":"ShRNA silencing glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"22100174"}
