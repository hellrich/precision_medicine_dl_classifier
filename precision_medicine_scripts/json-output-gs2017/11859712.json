Three genes, PRLTS, PTEN and p57, showed statistically significant differences in the LOH frequency between SCC and ADC.\nThe comparison of LOH frequencies between SCC and ADC indicates possible correlation between specific tumor suppressor genes and each type of lung cancer. The results also suggest that more attention should be paid to the PRLTS gene, which may play an important role in the development of ADC.","title":"[Comparison of tumor suppressor gene deletion between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma lung cancer in Chinese].","pubmedId":"11859712"}
