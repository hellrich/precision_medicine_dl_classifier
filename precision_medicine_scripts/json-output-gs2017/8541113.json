Tumours were screened for p53 abnormalities using immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction-constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (PCR-CDGE) analysis, followed by PCR and direct sequencing. Allelic loss at the TP53 locus was determined with polymorphic markers by comparing normal and tumour DNA. For approximately half of the patients, abnormal p53 protein expression in serum was determined by an ELISA assay. p53 abnormalities, detected as mutations and/or nuclear staining, were found in 37.6 (38/101) of cases. Nuclear staining for p53 protein could be identified in 33.7% of the tumours. Mutations in exons 5-8 were detected in 18.9% of the tumours, and an association was found between mutations and nuclear staining. Allelic loss in the TP53 region on 17p was more frequent in tumours showing changes in the TP53 gene (72.7%) compared to tumours with no mutation (45.8%). Serum levels of p53 antibodies showed no association with either TP53 mutations or nuclear staining. Women with TP53 mutations in their tumours had an elevated risk of dying during the study period (RR (relative risk) \u003d 3.4, P \u003d 0.014). The effects of p53 positive staining were similar (RR \u003d 3.2, P \u003d 0.013). Considering all abnormalities, mutation and/or staining, the relative risk of dying from breast cancer was 3.5 (P \u003d 0.008).","title":"TP53 mutations and abnormal p53 protein staining in breast carcinomas related to prognosis.","pubmedId":"8541113"}
