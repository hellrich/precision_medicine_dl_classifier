In the most malignant form of the disease, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), over 90% of patients will succumb to their tumor within 5 years after standard of care treatment, consisting of surgery, radiation therapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. It is now clear that gliomas are molecularly heterogeneous entities, with mutations in tumor suppressors and oncogenes defining many distinct sub-types with important therapy implications. However, almost all HGGs are treated with a limited array of initial therapies, regardless of these molecular differences. Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), a gene recently found to be mutated in many gliomas, is involved in the conversion of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate in cells. The IDH1 R132H mutant enzyme converts 2-oxoglutarate to the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), which leads to profound metabolic alterations in tumor cells. In addition, recent studies indicate that mutations in IDH1 may also induce altered DSB repair, differential sensitivities to chemo-radiotherapy, and substantial changes in chromatin modifications. Here, we present the creation of a novel astrocyte cell line harboring an engineered heterozygous IDH1 R132H mutation at the endogenous gene locus using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. We confirmed expression of the engineered mutation at the protein level, and we have characterized this cell line in a comprehensive panel of functional assays. In particular, we demonstrated that our mutant cell clones secrete high levels of D2HG, and we confirmed that the levels of this oncometabolite can be suppressed with small molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1. We also characterized the DNA damage response network in IDH1-mutant cells using high-content DNA damage foci assays recently developed by our group, and also in clonogenic survival assays. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an astrocyte cell line harboring an engineered, heterozygous R132H mutation at the endogenous locus. This novel cell line represents a new model system for studying gliomas and has tremendous applications for further cell characterization, mechanistic studies, and drug screening.","title":"Development and validation of a novel IDH1-mutant astrocyte cell line as a model for high-grade gliomas","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4277"}
