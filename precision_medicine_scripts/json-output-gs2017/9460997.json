We have used the comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) technique on 34 malignant mesotheliomas and 30 primary lung carcinomas (adenocarcinoma, including bronchoalveolar carcinoma and large-cell anaplastic carcinoma) to compare their copy number changes and to evaluate the use of CGH to distinguish between these two types of tumour. In mesothelioma, gains of genetic material occurred as frequently as losses, whereas gains predominated over losses in carcinoma. In mesothelioma, the most frequent changes were losses in 4q, 6q and 14q and gains in 15q and 7p, whereas gains in 8q, 1q, 7p, 5p and 6p were the most common changes in carcinoma. Amplification of KRAS2 was detected in two adenocarcinomas by Southern blot analysis. CGH showed gains in 12p in the same tumours. Statistically significant differences between the two types of tumour were detected in chromosomes X, 1, 2p, 4, 8q, 10q, 12p, 14q, 15q and 18q. When comparing the frequency of gains and losses between mesothelioma and lung carcinoma using discriminant analysis, the sensitivity of CGH to differentiate mesotheliomas from lung carcinomas was 81% and the specificity 77%. The differences in DNA copy number changes between the two types of tumour suggest that they are genetically different tumour entities. Although CGH cannot be used as a definitive discriminatory method, we were able to distinguish between mesothelioma and lung carcinoma in a large proportion of the abnormal cases.","title":"Comparison of DNA copy number changes in malignant mesothelioma, adenocarcinoma and large-cell anaplastic carcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"9460997"}
