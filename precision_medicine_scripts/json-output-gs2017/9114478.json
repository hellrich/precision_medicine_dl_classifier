Considering the complexities and heterogeneity in the genetics of familial melanoma, predictive testing is not currently recommended as an established method for identifying individuals with a genetic predisposition to melanoma.\nAn understanding of the genetics of melanoma will help oncology nurses in translating the appropriate clinical implications for primary and secondary prevention related to melanoma.","title":"The genetics of melanoma.","pubmedId":"9114478"}
