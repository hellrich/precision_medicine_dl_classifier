The purified enzymes from these sources are different proteins, as demonstrated by differences in electrophoretic mobility and absence of crossreactivity by immunotitration and immunodiffusion. The NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase in the soluble supernatant homogenate fraction from pig liver, kidney cortex, brain and erythrocyte hemolyzate was identical with the purified enzyme from pig liver cytosol, as determined by electrophoretic mobility and immunological techniques. The enzyme in extracts of mitochondria from pig heart, kidney, liver and brain was identical with the purified pig heart enzyme by the same criteria. However, the \u0027mitochondrial\u0027 isozyme was the major component also in the soluble supernatant fraction of pig heart homogenate. The \u0027cytosolic\u0027 isozyme accounted for only 1-2% of total NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase in pig heart, as determined by separation of the isozymes with agarose gel electrophoresis and immunotitration. The mitochondrial isozyme was also the predominant NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase in porcine skeletal muscle. The ratio of cytosolic/mitochondrial isozyme for porcine whole tissue extract, determined by immunotitration, was about 2 for liver and 1 for kidney cortex and brain. The distribution of isozymes in cell homogenate fractions from ox and rat tissues corresponded to that observed in organs of porcine origin. The mitochondrial and cytosolic isozymes from ox and rat tissues exhibited crossreactivity with the antibodies against the pig heart and pig liver cytosol enzyme, respectively, and the electrophoretic migration patterns were similar qualitatively to those found for the isozymes in porcine tissues. Nevertheless, there were species specific differences in the characteristics of each of the corresponding isozymes. NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase was not inhibited by the antibodies, confirming that the protein is distinct from that of either isozyme of NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase.","title":"The subcellular location of isozymes of NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase in tissues from pig, ox and rat.","pubmedId":"6414522"}
