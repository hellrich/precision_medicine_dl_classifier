In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the expression of CDK4. Cell growth curve, doubling time, cell cycle distribution and the growth capacities on soft agar were analyzed before and after antisense CDK4 RNA was transferred into malignant transformed cells induced by silica.\nDuring the malignant transformation of 2BS cells induced by silica, CDK4 gene was overexpressed. Antisense pXJ41-CDK4 transduction suppressed CDK4 gene expression in the antisense pXJ41-CDK4 transfected cells. Antisense CDK4 RNA led to cell cycle arrest, resulting in lengthened G1 phase (the percentages of cells in the G1 phase increased from 45.1% to 58.0%), and eventually attenuated the proliferation of malignant transformed cells induced by silica. At the 8th day, the suppression rates decreased by 77.43%. The doubling time prolonged from 21.0 h to 42.7 h. The growth capacities on soft agar of cells transfected by antisense pXJ41-CDK4 were decreased.\nCDK4 might play an important role in maintaining the transformed phenotype of the cancer cells.","title":"[The role of cycline dependent kinase 4 in the malignant transformation induced by silica].","pubmedId":"15555303"}
