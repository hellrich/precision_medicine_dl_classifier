Expression of the transfected CD gene in SW1116 (SWCD(2)) was confirmed by RT-PCR. The cytotoxicity of 5-Fc on SW1116 was determined by MTT assay in vitro. In vivo, the CD gene expression vector was injected intratumorally and 5-Fc was given by ip injections.\nIn vitro, SWCD(2) cells were killed by 5-Fc with an IC(50) of 66 micromol/L while the nontrasfected SW1116 cells needed an IC(50) of 16 000 micromol/L to be killed. The growth of SWCD(2) xenografts was significantly inhibited by systemic administration of 5-Fc.\nCD gene/5-Fc system is a potential gene therapy strategy for human colon cancer.","title":"[Experimental studies on the treatment of colon cancer by cytosine deaminase gene and 5-fluorocytosine].","pubmedId":"15771788"}
