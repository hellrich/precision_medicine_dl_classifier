{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Secretory carcinoma of the male breast (juvenile carcinoma) is a rare neoplasm. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature.\nWe report here a case in a 17-year old male presenting with recurrent breast swelling.\nThough considered an indolent neoplasm, secretory carcinoma does metastasise to lymph nodes and recur after local excision. Surgery in form of mastectomy with axillary clearance is the treatment of choice.","title":"Secretory carcinoma of breast in a 17-year-old male.","pubmedId":"15175103"}
