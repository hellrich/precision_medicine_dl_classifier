These fusion proteins have potent oncogenic activity and are thought to be an attractive therapeutic target. In a kinase inhibitor screening we identified CH7057288, a potent and selective TRK inhibitor belonging to a novel chemical class. Our inhibitor showed selective inhibitory activity against TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC in cell-free kinase assays and suppressed proliferation of TRK fusion-positive cell lines, but not that of TRK-negative cell lines. In subcutaneously implanted xenograft models of TRK fusion-positive cells, strong tumor growth inhibition was observed. Furthermore, CH7057288 induced regression of intracranial tumors and greatly improved event-free survival in an intracranial implantation model mimicking brain metastasis. Recently, resistant mutations in TRK have been reported in patients showing disease progression after treatment with a TRK inhibitor under clinical development. Our compound maintained similar levels of in vitro and in vivo activity against some of the resistant mutants as it did to wild-type TRK. In summary, CH7057288 could be a promising therapeutic agent for TRK fusion-positive cancer.","title":"Potent and selective TRK inhibitor CH7057288.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-4179"}
