These wild-type patients comprise a significant proportion of those treated with inhibitors of this pathway, and data from randomized trials suggest that some of these wild-type patients will derive a modest benefit from these agents. Although the detection of an activating mutation predicts for a greater likelihood of response and longer progression-free survival from an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, currently there are no biomarkers that consistently and reproducibly predict for lack of benefit in wild-type patients. Several strategies to increase the efficacy of these inhibitors in wild-type NSCLC are the subject of ongoing investigations.","title":"Role of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23401452"}
