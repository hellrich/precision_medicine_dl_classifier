The individualized treatment of lung cancer is attached great importance at present. Echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) as a new biological marker is a hot topic in the field of lung cancer treatment. Meanwhile, with the improvement of anticancer treatment and survival, the incidence of multiple primary carcinomas (MPC) has become increasingly. But the report that malignant lymphoma complicated with lung adenocarcinoma harboring EML4-ALK fusion gene in one individual is rare. Here, we report an EML4-ALK positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a patient previously diagnosed with T cell lymphoma and review literature on metachronous lung cancer complicating with lymphoma. \n近年来随着分子生物学研究的不断深入，靶向治疗成为当前肺癌治疗的趋势。目前肺癌个体化的最佳治疗效果日益受到重视，棘皮动物微管相关蛋白4-间变型淋巴瘤激酶（echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 anaplastic lymphoma kinase, EML4-ALK）融合基因作为新兴生物标记物是当前肺癌治疗领域研究热点。与此同时，随着抗肿瘤治疗水平的不断提高，生存期明显延长，发生多原发癌（multiple primary carcinomas, MPC）的机会增多。EML4-ALK融合基因阳性的肺腺癌合并淋巴瘤发生于同一患者文献报道罕见。本文报道1例ALK融合基因阳性的非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）合并淋巴瘤病例，同时对异时性肺癌合并淋巴瘤的文献进行复习。","title":"[A case report: an EML4-ALK positive lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed \u2029with lymphoma previously].","pubmedId":"25676402"}
