Most meningiomas are effectively addressed by surgical resection. However unresectable, partially resected, recurrent and high grade meningiomas are also typically treated with adjuvant or definitive radiation therapy.Retinoids are a class of compounds structurally related to Vitamin A. Retinoic acid (RA), the active derivative of vitamin A and the first diffusible morphogen in vertebrates, has recently been evaluated for its chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive attributes in solid tumors. Additionally, a novel orally bioavailable synthetic retinoid, fenretinide, has been tested with different pharmacokinetics, side effect profile, and mechanism of action than the classic retinoids, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 13-cis-retinoic acid (13CRA). In this project, we study the effects of retinoic acid agents alone and in combination with ionizing radiation in meningioma cell lines (IOMM-Lee and CH157MN).We demonstrate that ATRA, 13CRA and fenretinide have similar (increasing) toxicity profiles in both cell lines at doses above 1M; but below this concentration there are minimal changes on cellular proliferation. Pretreatment of meningioma cell lines with 1M doses of ATRA and 13CRA protected cells from radiation-induced cell death, while pre-treatment with fenretinide had no effect. Using flow cytometric analysis, we demonstrated that RA inhibited radiation-induced G2/M phase accumulation. Western blot result showed that ionizing radiation increased Phospho-Chk1 and -Chk2 levels, and decreased the levels of cdc25c, Phospho-cdc25c (Ser126) and Phospho cdc25c(THr68), Pre-treatment with RTRA reversed each of these effects in a dose- and time-dependent manner.These data suggest a role for the classic RAs in radiation protection through modulation of DNA repair through cell cycle checkpoint pathways. Fenretinide, however, works through a different mechanism, and does not result in radiation protection. These divergent roles suggest that fenretinide may escape the concerns of radiation protection of earlier retinoids making it a promising agent for tumor treatment in the periradiotherapy period.","title":"Meningioma: response to retinoids and radiation therapy.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-71"}
