Soon after GIST was recognized as a tumor driven by a KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor mutation, it became the first solid tumor target for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. More recently, alternative molecular mechanisms for GIST pathogenesis have been discovered. These are related to deficiencies in the succinate dehydrogenase complex, NF1-gene alterations in connection with neurofibromatosis type 1 tumor syndrome, and mutational activation of the BRAF oncogene in very rare cases.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"23639648"}
