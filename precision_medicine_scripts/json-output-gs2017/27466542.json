Trials have suggested a differential response to the second-generation EGFR TKI afatinib in favour of del19. We investigated whether this differential response is observed in clinical practice.\nRetrospective demographic, treatment and outcome data were collected on patients with: stage III/IV NSCLC and either del19 or L858R, receiving an EGFR TKI as first-line treatment.\nThere was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between del19 (648 days, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u003d461-835) and L858R (813 days, 95%CI\u003d387-1,238), (p\u003d0.616), or in duration of therapy between del19 (365 days, 95% CI\u003d192-538) and L858 (428 days, 95% CI\u003d263-593), (p\u003d0.928).\nPatients with exon del19 did not have a significantly longer OS with first-generation TKIs.","title":"Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in South Wales: Are Exon 19 Deletions and L858R Different?","pubmedId":"27466542"}
