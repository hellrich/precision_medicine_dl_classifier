The result of PCR-SSCP silver staining indicated that the mutational rate was 30% (12/40), all mutations were observed in lung adenocarcinoma and its mutational rate was 44% (12/27). The result of DNA direct sequencing showed that 11 of the 12 positive samples screened by PCR-SSCP had mutation and 90% of K-ras mutations were in codon 12. The mutation was mainly G--\u003eT transversion and G--\u003eA transition. The study suggested that SSCP silver staining analysis is very useful in screening large amount of samples simultaneously and PCR-SSCP-DNA direct sequencing method is quite efficient for the detection of oncogene mutation.","title":"[Detection of K-ras oncogene mutations in human lung cancer by PCR-SSCP-DNA direct sequencing].","pubmedId":"10682630"}
