However, only limited data are available for melanoma harboring other somatic than BRAF, KIT, and NRAS mutations. Mutations in guanine nucleotide-binding protein Q polypeptide (GNAQ) and guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha-11 (GNA11), alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, constitutively activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in uveal melanoma. However, there are no reports of GNA11 mutations in cutaneous melanomas. A 48-year-old woman was diagnosed with cutaneous nodular melanoma on the left scalp. Mutation analysis of the tumor revealed a GNA11 Q209L mutation. There was no evidence of uveal melanoma or malignant blue nevus in ophthalmologic exam, imaging studies, and pathology review. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to demonstrate cutaneous origin melanoma harboring a GNA11 Q209L mutation.","title":"GNA11 Mutation in a Patient With Cutaneous Origin Melanoma: A Case Report.","pubmedId":"26825879"}
