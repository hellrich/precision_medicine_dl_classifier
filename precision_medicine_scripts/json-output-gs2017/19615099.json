The germline mutations in the serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) gene have been shown to be associated with the disease. Individuals with PJS are at increased risk for development of various neoplasms. The aim of the present study was to characterize the genotype and phenotype of Czech patients with PJS.\nWe examined genomic DNA of 8 individuals from five Czech families by sequencing analysis of STK11 gene, covering its promotor region, the entire coding region and the splice-site boundaries, and by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay designed for the identification of large exonic deletions or duplications of STK11 gene.\nWe found pathogenic mutations in STK11 gene in two families fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of PJS and in one of three sporadic cases not complying with the criteria. The patient with the frameshift mutation in STK11 gene developed aggressive gastric cancer. No other studied proband has developed a carcinoma so far.\nOur results showed that a germline mutation of STK11 gene can be found not only in probands fulfilling the PJS diagnostic criteria, but also in some sporadic cases not complying with the criteria. Moreover, we observed a new case of aggressive gastric cancer in a young patient with a frameshift mutation of STK11 gene.","title":"Mutations in STK11 gene in Czech Peutz-Jeghers patients.","pubmedId":"19615099"}
