Cisplatin-based chemotherapy produces a modest benefit in survival compared with that observed with best supportive care. Gemcitabine (Gemzar; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN), a novel nucleoside antimetabolite, is active and well tolerated. The combination of gemcitabine/cisplatin has shown a significant improvement in response rate and survival over cisplatin alone. Phase III trials comparing gemcitabine/cisplatin with older combinations such as cisplatin/etoposide or mitomycin/ifosfamide/cisplatin have shown a higher activity for gemcitabine/cisplatin; however, the best way to combine these drugs remains unclear. In addition, the 3-week schedule has obtained a higher dose intensity with less toxicity and similar efficacy as the 4-week schedule. The role of carboplatin in combination with new drugs is still under evaluation. Gemcitabine/carboplatin seems to be a good alternative, with the advantage of ambulatory administration and lower nonhematologic toxicity. The 4-week schedule has produced frequent grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in some studies. The 3-week schedule, using gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin on day 1, is a convenient and well-tolerated regimen. The toxicity profile is acceptable without serious symptoms. This schedule could be considered a good option as a standard regimen.
