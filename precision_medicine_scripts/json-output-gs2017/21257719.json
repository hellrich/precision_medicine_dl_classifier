The thyroid transcription factor 1 (TITF-1) gene functions as a lineage survival gene abnormally expressed in a significant fraction of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), in particular lung adenocarcinomas.\nTo better characterize TITF-1 abnormality patterns in NSCLC, we studied TITF-1\u0027s gene copy number using FISH and quantitative PCR, as well as its protein expression by immunohistochemistry analysis in a tissue microarray comprising surgically resected NSCLC (N \u003d 321) including 204 adenocarcinomas and 117 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). TITF-1 copy number and protein expression were correlated with patients\u0027 clinicopathologic characteristics, and in a subset of adenocarcinomas with EGFR and KRAS mutation status.\nWe found that increased TITF-1 protein expression was prevalent in lung adenocarcinomas only and was significantly associated with female gender (P \u003c 0.001), never-smokers (P \u003d 0.004), presence of EGFR mutations (P \u003d 0.05), and better overall survival (all stages, P \u003d 0.0478; stages I and II, P \u003d 0.002). TITF-1 copy number gain(CNG) was detected by FISH analysis in both adenocarcinomas (18.9%; high CNG, 8.3%) and SCCs (20.1%; high CNG, 3.0%), and correlated significantly with the protein product (P \u003d 0.004) and presence of KRAS mutations (P \u003d 0.008) in lung adenocarcinomas. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that TITF-1 copy number gain was an independent predictor of poor survival of NSCLC (P \u003d 0.039).\nOur integrative study demonstrates that the protein versus genomic patterns of TITF-1 have opposing roles in lung cancer prognosis and may occur preferentially in different subsets of NSCLC patients with distinct oncogene mutations.","title":"Abnormalities of the TITF-1 lineage-specific oncogene in NSCLC: implications in lung cancer pathogenesis and prognosis.","pubmedId":"21257719"}
