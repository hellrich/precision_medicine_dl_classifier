We identified that hsa-miR-623 bound to the 3\u0027-UTR of Ku80 mRNA, thus significantly decreasing Ku80 expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Hsa-miR-623 was downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with corresponding non-tumorous tissues, and its expression was inversely correlated with Ku80 upregulation. Downregulation of hsa-miR-623 was associated with poor clinical outcomes of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Hsa-miR-623 suppressed lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration and invasion in vitro. Hsa-miR-623 inhibited xenografts growth and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma in vivo. Ku80 knockdown in lung adenocarcinoma cells suppressed tumor properties in vitro and in vivo similar to hsa-miR-623 overexpression. Further, hsa-miR-623 overexpression decreased matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 expression levels, with decreased ERK/JNK phosphorylation. Inhibition of hsa-miR-623 or overexpression of Ku80 promoted lung adenocarcinoma cell invasion, activated ERK/JNK phosphorylation and increased MMP-2/9 expressions, which could be reversed by ERK kinase inhibitor or JNK kinase inhibitor. In summary, our results showed that hsa-miR-623 was downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and suppressed the invasion and metastasis targeting Ku80 through ERK/JNK inactivation mediated downregulation of MMP-2/9. These findings reveal that hsa-miR-623 may serve as an important therapeutic target in lung cancer therapy.","title":"Hsa-miR-623 suppresses tumor progression in human lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27685632"}
