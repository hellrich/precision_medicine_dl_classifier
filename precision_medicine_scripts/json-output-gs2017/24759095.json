However, Simpson grade I removal is sometimes difficult, especially in cases with ventral dural attachment, because of the risk of spinal cord damage or the difficulty of dural repair after radical resection. In addition, there is no consensus on a surgical strategy for radicality, whether or not Simpson grade I resection should be performed in all cases of spinal meningioma. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical and radiological data of surgically treated 14 patients with spinal meningioma, to assess the influence of the Simpson grade to tumor recurrences during long-term follow-up (median 8.2 years, 1.3-27.9). The number of patients in Simpson grades I, II, III, and IV were 2, 8, 0, and 3, respectively; Simpson grading was not applicable to one patient with non-dura-based meningioma. No postoperative permanent neurological worsening was encountered. The recurrence rate was 21.4% (3 out of 14 cases). Of these 3 recurrent cases, 1 was a case of non-dura-based meningioma and another was a case of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2); both of them are known as risk factors for recurrence after surgical removal of spinal meningiomas. Considering this background of these two recurrences, the clinical results of the present study are consistent with previous results. Therefore, we propose that surgeons do not always have to achieve Simpson grade I removal if dural repair is complicated and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage or neurological worsening are estimated after resection of dural attachment and repair of dural defect.
