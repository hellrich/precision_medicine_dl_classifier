Exon 15 BRAF mutations were found in 13 of 52 (25%) primary melanomas. These comprised five of 17 (29%) superficial spreading melanomas, three of 11 (27%) nodular melanomas, two of 13 (15%) acral lentiginous melanomas, one of one (100%) mucosal melanoma and two of 10 (20%) lentigo maligna melanomas. In common with other groups, our findings show a relative concentration of the exon 15 BRAF mutation in superficial spreading and nodular melanomas, but add further evidence that this mutation not necessary for malignant transformation of the melanocyte.","title":"Prevalence of exon 15 BRAF mutations in primary melanoma of the superficial spreading, nodular, acral, and lentigo maligna subtypes.","pubmedId":"16117801"}
