The incidence of breast cancer in Chinese is quite low in comparison with Caucasians, and genetic factors may play some roles. To further determine the role of PTEN/MMAC1 in breast cancer in Chinese, we used loss of heterozygosity (LOH), single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) with direct sequencing of variant bands, and Southern blot analysis methods to analyze mutations in PTEN/MMAC1 in 52 cases of breast cancer. None had LOH at chromosome 10q23.3. One mutation was identified, a somatic 3-base deletion, in one case. Our results suggest PTEN/MMAC1 does not play a major role in the development of sporadic breast cancer.","title":"Mutation analysis of the putative tumor suppression gene PTEN/MMAC1 in sporadic breast cancer.","pubmedId":"10472782"}
