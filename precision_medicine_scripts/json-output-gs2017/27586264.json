These tumors are collectively termed extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumors can also develop in the liver. Only eight case reports involving primary GIST of the liver have been published. We report a case and review the literature regarding this disease.\nA 70-year-old woman with a past history of gastric cancer visited our hospital for regular inspection. With extensive radiological imaging, a computed tomography scan revealed a mass with a size of 6.8Â cm in the lateral segment of the liver. (18)F-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed no other malignancies except for the liver tumor. Because the lesion was suspected of being a primary malignant hepatic tumor, lateral segmentectomy was performed. The immunohistochemical analysis supported the diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors in the liver. The patient has had no evidence of recurrence during the 10-month follow-up period; imatinib chemotherapy was not administered.\nPrimary hepatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors had no characteristics that distinguished them from ordinary tumors in imaging examinations. Primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors might have developed from interstitial Cajal-like cells.","title":"Primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the liver: a case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"27586264"}
