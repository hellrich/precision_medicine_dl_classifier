Criteria to be included in the study were: 1) Follow-up of more than 3 years, 2) Cholelithiasis excluded preoperatively by ultrasonography, 3) Ultrasonographic postoperative control once a year.\nTen patients met the established criteria. Six of them developed biliary lithiasis, and four of them needed surgical treatment for biliary symptomatology.\nThe incidence of cholelithiasis after total gastrectomy for gastric cancer is high, and surgical treatment is often necessary. However our data does not support prophylactic cholecystectomy in the course of total gastrectomy.","title":"[Cholelithiasis after total gastrectomy for gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"8186023"}
