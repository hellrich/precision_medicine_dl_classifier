Stains for lipid, Sudan III, Sudan IV, and Oil Red \"O\", demonstrated the presence of intracellular lipid in the lipoblasts. Similarly, the S-100 immunoreactivity and electron microscopic findings of tumor cells confirmed the diagnosis of liposarcoma. Histochemical stains for PAS, Alcian-blue, mucikarmin, Toluidin-blue and Coloidal Iron were negative.","title":"[Primary liposarcoma of bone].","pubmedId":"11419292"}
