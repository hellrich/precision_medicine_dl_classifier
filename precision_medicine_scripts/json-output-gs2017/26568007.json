However, the size of the metastatic adrenal lesion increased, and the patient died due to multiple organ failure. An autopsy report revealed that the metastatic lesion of the adrenal tumor was ALK rearrangement-positive pleomorphic carcinoma. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker vimentin was immunohistochemically positive in both the lung and adrenal lesions. The present case report suggests the possibility of transformation into pleomorphic carcinoma as a result of EMT in patients with ALK rearrangement-positive lung cancer.
