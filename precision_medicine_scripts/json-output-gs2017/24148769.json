Thus, the stability of PTEN is essential for tumor prevention and therapy. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has an important role in regulating the functions of PTEN. Specifically, carboxyl terminus Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP), the E3 ubiquitin ligase of PTEN, can regulate PTEN levels. In this study, we report that BCL-2-associated athanogene 5 (BAG5), a known inhibitor of CHIP activity, reduces the degradation of PTEN and maintains its levels via an ubiquitylation-dependent pathway. BAG5 is identified as an antagonist of cell tumorigenicity.","title":"BAG5 regulates PTEN stability in MCF-7 cell line.","pubmedId":"24148769"}
