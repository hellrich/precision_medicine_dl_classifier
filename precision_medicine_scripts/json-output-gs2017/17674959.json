Improved outcomes after the Whipple procedure have been attributed to better preoperative patient selection, advances in three-dimensional radiographic imaging, and regionalization of referrals to high-volume, tertiary care centers. Despite these advances, morbidity and mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy are not insignificant and the overall prognosis following resection for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas remains poor. Improvements in endoscopic decompression of malignant biliary obstruction have decreased the need for palliative bypass operations and have focused current surgical issues on ways to improve clinical outcomes following potentially curative resections. Controversies such as whether or not to perform extended lymph node dissections, and standard versus pylorus-preserving resections have been addressed by randomized, prospective clinical trials. Major venous resections secondary to local tumor extension are now performed without an increase in morbidity or mortality and with survival rates comparable to standard resections. This has led to even more aggressive resections following neoadjuvant therapy for lesions previously considered unresectable and now perhaps better categorized as borderline resectable. The impact of surgical specialization and regionalization of referrals to tertiary care centers is evident in markedly improved perioperative mortality rates. This article will attempt to describe current guidelines for the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management of patients with localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"Guidelines for the surgical management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"17674959"}
