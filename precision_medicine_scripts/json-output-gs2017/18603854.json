Under a diagnosis of biliary and duodenal stenosis due to so called \"groove pancreatitis\", prednisolone (30 mg/day, 2 weeks) was administered. But these stenosis did not improve after the treatment, and pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Histologically, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was found in the \"groove\" between the duodenum and the pancreatic head. We should be kept of \"pancreatic groove carcinoma\" in mind when making a diagnosis of \"groove pancreatitis\".","title":"[Pancreatic groove carcinoma in a young adult].","pubmedId":"18603854"}
