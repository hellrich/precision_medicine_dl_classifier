Mortality rate has increased 40%-50% in advanced cardiac failure and 15%-25% in mild to moderate cardiac failure within one year of diagnosis. There is no established biochemical marker for the diagnosis, prognosis and staging of heart failure. Cardiac Troponin I may be a novel useful tool in identifying patients with Heart failure who are at increased risk for progressive ventricular dysfunction and death. Thirty six congestive heart failure cases and thirty six healthy controls were included in this study and serum cardiac troponin I and Ejection fraction were measured. All the study subjects were grouped according to the NYHA class they belong. Cardiac troponin I was significantly higher in CHF cases than the controls. Troponin I also significantly differed among groups. EF of cases was significantly lower than the controls and also differed among groups. A significant negative correlation between cardiac troponin I and progressive decline of ejection fraction was evident in this study. Cardiac troponin I increased progressively with progression of heart failure. Thus, Cardiac troponin I could be used to stratify patients undergoing heart failure in to high and low risk groups for future cardiac events. Cardiac troponin I could also be used as a very important marker for the prognosis of the patients with congestive heart failure.","title":"Role of cardiac troponin I in staging and prognosis of congestive heart failure subjects.","pubmedId":"17344772"}
