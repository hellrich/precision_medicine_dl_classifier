The reproducibility analysis was performed by applying the PDSS in test-retest; internal consistency was verified by applying the scale in 90 children and adolescents.\nThe mean score of the sum of PDSS questions was 15.6 (SD\u003d5.0) points. The PDSS showed appropriate indicators of content validation and clarity for the Brazilian Portuguese version. The internal consistency analysis showed a Cronbach\u0027s alpha of 0.784. The PDSS showed adequate reproducibility. The PDSS scores showed a significant and negative correlation with time spent in bed (r\u003d-0.214; p\u003d0.023).\nThe Brazilian Portuguese version of the PDSS shows satisfactory indicators of validity and can be applied in clinical practice and scientific research.","title":"Translation and validation of the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) into Brazilian Portuguese.","pubmedId":"26686097"}
