The overexpression or amplification of various oncogenes in diverse human brain tumors have been observed. While numerous studies on the immunohistochemical demonstration of EGFR-overexpression have been reported, little has been found in the literature about the c-erbB-2 protein in human astrocytic tumors. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of EGFR and c-erbB-2 protein in 33 astrocytic tumors with immunohistochemistry. According to the World Health Organization brain tumor classification, the study included 9 low-grade astrocytomas (grade 2), 15 anaplastic astrocytomas (grade 3), and 9 glioblastomas multiforme (grade 4). The positive EGFR immunoreactivity was detected in 28 (85%) of 33 tumors. The expression of EGFR increased with the grade of malignancy in low-grade astrocytomas (67%), anaplastic astrocytomas (87%), and glioblastomas (100%). For the expression of c-erbB-2 protein, 17 (51.5%) of 33 tumors were positive immunostain, including 3 low-grade astrocytomas (37.5%), 9 anaplastic astrocytomas (81.8%), and 5 glioblastomas (62.5%). Different degrees of immunoreactivity for c-erbB-2 protein were found in variant grades of astrocytomas. However, the positive immunostain of EGFR displayed moderate or strong reactivity. The coexpression of EGFR and c-erbB-2 protein was found in 17 (15.5%) of 33 tumors. The results emphasize that the overexpression of EGFR parallels astrocytoma progession and higher frequency of c-erbB-2 immunoreactivity was seen in snaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas than in low-grade astrocytomas.","title":"Expression of epidermal growth factor receptors and c-erbB-2 proteins in human astrocytic tumors.","pubmedId":"9260461"}
