Our recent study showed that CDK8 plays an important role in the formation of pancreatic cancer, but the CDK8 expression levels were not completely identical in different pancreatic cancer samples. The level of CDK8 expression depended on whether the K-ras gene was mutated; its expression was much higher in samples carrying a K-ras mutation than in wild-type K-ras samples. Moreover, CDK8 expression was reduced following mutated K-ras knockdown in K-ras-mutated pancreatic cancer cells, whereas CDK8 expression was increased following expression of mutated K-ras in wild-type K-ras cells. Our study demonstrates that mutated K-ras stimulates CDK8 expression, possibly by regulating HIF-1α, and both CDK8 and mutated K-ras were confirmed to promote cell proliferation and prevent apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, we found that both CDK8 and mutated K-ras promote the invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells via the positive regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby increasing the expression of Snail1 and ZEB1, which act as important stimulating factors of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Finally, knockdown of either CDK8 or mutated K-ras contributed to attenuated pancreatic cancer growth in BALB/c nude mice. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that mutated K-ras promotes CDK8 expression and that the regulatory effects of CDK8 on the EMT are partially attributed to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.","title":"Mutated K-ras activates CDK8 to stimulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic cancer in part via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.","pubmedId":"25305448"}
