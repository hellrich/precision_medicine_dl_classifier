Colorectal cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality according to categories of hormone use were assessed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for other risk factors for cancer survival.\nPostmenopausal estrogen use before diagnosis of colorectal cancer was associated with significant reduction in mortality. Compared with women with no prior estrogen use, those reporting current use before diagnosis had an adjusted HR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.88) for colorectal cancer-specific mortality and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.97) for overall mortality. This inverse association between hormone use and mortality was most evident among women whose duration of use was less than 5 years. Longer durations and past use were not associated with significant survival benefit. Assessment of estrogen use after diagnosis demonstrated similar findings.\nCurrent postmenopausal estrogen use before diagnosis of colorectal cancer was associated with improved colorectal cancer-specific and overall mortality. This benefit was principally limited to women who initiated estrogens within 5 years of diagnosis. Additional efforts to understand mechanisms through which estrogens influence colorectal carcinogenesis and cancer progression seem warranted.","title":"Hormone replacement therapy and survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis.","pubmedId":"17179103"}
