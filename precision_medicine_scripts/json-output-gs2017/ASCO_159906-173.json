Also, as adjuvant chemotherapy, we adopted this GFP regimen (GEM, 5-FU, and Cisplatin). We demonstrate the adequate surgical strategy, the effect of adjuvant therapy and the tumor malignancy evaluation.  Methods:  Study 1: Surgical strategy) In period 1 (1994.4-2004.3, n \u003d 20), extended surgery was basically performed. In period 2 (2004.4~, n \u003d 34), extent of hepatectomy is conducted according to tumor conditions. Swelling LN exterpation for macroscopic curability and bile duct resection for positive surgical margin are performed.  Study2: Adjuvant GFP therapy) Induction of 2 cycles of GFP for advanced IHCC with prognostic factors (LN metastasis, intrahepatic metastasis and R2 resection).  Study 3: Malignancy evaluation) Significance of serum CA19-9 levels, the relationships its levels and expressions (immunostaining) of hypoxic inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) /Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) were evaluated.  Results:  Study 1) In period 2, LN dissection and extrahepatic bile duct resection were significantly infrequent. Surgical outcome is rather good regardless of limited surgery in recent periods (Period 1 vs. Period 2: 5yrs survival 24.9% vs. 34.9%, p \u003d 0.119). There was no significant difference in recurrent pattern.  Study 2) There were 32 cases had some kind of prognostic factors, and of these 11 patients received adjuvant GFP. Patients prognosis received adjuvant GFP was significantly prolonged (GFP vs. non GFP: 1yrs survival 71.6% vs. 45.0%, p \u003c 0.02).  Study 3) CA19-9 ( \u003e 300U/ml) high group revealed the independent prognostic factor with stepwise model, as well as LN metastasis and vessels invasion. CA19-9 levels significantly correlated to HDAC1 and HIF-1 expressions.  Conclusions:  Extended surgery including LN dissection might not control malignant behavior of IHCC, and adjuvant GFP should be introduced in patients with poor prognostic factors.","title":"Treatment strategy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: From optimal surgical management to adjuvant therapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_159906-173"}
