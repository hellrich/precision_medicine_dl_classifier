The EBF3 locus on chromosome 10q26.3 is epigenetically silenced or deleted in several types of cancers. In addition, EBF3 activates genes involved in cell cycle arrest and inhibits cell survival. However, inactivation of EBF3 gene expression was not fully studied in gastric carcinoma and the functions of EBF3 that underlie EBF3-regulated tumor suppression have not been identified. In our study, we found that inactivation of the EBF3 gene is frequently accompanied by promoter region hypermethylation in several gastric cancer cell lines and that the gene is reactivated by 5-aza-2\u0027-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dc) and/or trichostatin A (TSA) in all ten gastric cancer cell lines. We performed functional analysis using small interfering RNA or expressional cDNA transfection in gastric cancer cell lines and demonstrate that EBF3 represses gastric cancer cell growth and migration, but activates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Promoter methylation of EBF3 was detected in 42/104 (40.4%) gastric cancer tissues but not in normal gastric tissues. Furthermore, promoter methylation of EBF3 was found to be significantly correlated with lymphatic invasion (p \u003d 0.013) and poor survival (p \u003d 0.038) in gastric carcinoma. These results suggest that EBF3 tumor suppressor is epigenetically silenced and that it serves as an independent prognostic marker in gastric carcinoma.","title":"Aberrant DNA methylation and tumor suppressive activity of the EBF3 gene in gastric carcinoma.","pubmedId":"21387304"}
