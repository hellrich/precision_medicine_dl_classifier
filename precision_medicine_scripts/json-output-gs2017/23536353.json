Aberrant activation of tyrosine kinase through mutated KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRA) is the key pathogenic factor in most cases. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib and sunitinib can suppress activation of tyrosine kinase receptor and has gained wide recognition as the first-line adjuvant therapy for advanced or high-risk GIST after surgery. It has become the classic model of treatment for solid tumor with molecular targeted therapy. However, the emergence of drug-resistance limits the long-term benefit of these drugs in most patients and has been a challenging clinical concern. Many factors are related to the resistance of TKI, of which KIT/PDGFRA mutation is the most important one. Genetic amplification of KIT, loss of heterozygosity, activation of an alternative downstream signaling pathways, and drug concentration are all possible factors. Therefore, reasonable individual treatment strategy and early resistance evaluation for imatinib- and sunitinib-resistant GISTs are important to patients with drug resistance in order to improve therapeutic efficacy and quality of life.","title":"[Molecular mechanism and therapeutic strategy for resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in targeted treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors].","pubmedId":"23536353"}
