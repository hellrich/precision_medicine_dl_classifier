These agents are also being tested in earlier-stage patients, in addition to alternative dosing regimens and in combinations with other therapeutics. Efforts are also ongoing to expand the success found with targeted therapies to other subtypes of melanoma, including NRAS and c-kit mutated melanomas, uveal melanomas, and BRAF/NRAS wild type melanomas.
