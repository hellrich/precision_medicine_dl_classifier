It represents a histologically diverse group of soft tissue tumors that demonstrate a wide range of imaging appearances with varied behavior patterns. Correspondingly, more aggressive histological subtypes often require management that includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Distinguishing among liposarcoma subtypes has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. In this manuscript, we review the liposarcoma subtypes and their histologic and MRI findings, prognostic implications, and differential diagnostic considerations.
