RFP is expressed in a variety of human and rodent tumor cell lines and in several kinds of human cancer. Expression of RFP is associated with prognosis of colon and endometrial cancers. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of RFP in lung cancer and assessed its clinical significance. Tissue microarrays were constructed from 108 cases of lung cancer, and the sections were analyzed for RFP expression by immunohistochemistry. RFP expression was detected in the nucleus in 66.7% of lung cancer tissues examined. RFP expression was statistically significantly associated with thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) expression (P\u003d 0.028). However, no significant association was observed between RFP expression and other clinicopathological or genetic factors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Interestingly, we found that RFP expression correlated with poor prognosis in patients with EGFR mutations (P\u003d 0.032). Our results suggest that RFP has a role in mutated EGFR signaling and that RFP status may be a prognostic factor for lung cancer with EGFR mutations.","title":"RET finger protein expression is associated with prognosis in lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations.","pubmedId":"22524660"}
