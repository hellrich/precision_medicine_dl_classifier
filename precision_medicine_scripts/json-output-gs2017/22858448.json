Assessment of EGFR mutation status for EGFR-TKIs (tyrosin kinase inhibitors) treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients can be performed by DNA-based assay. To establish a testing algorithm for EGFR mutation status in NSCLC patients, we utilized the peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid (PNA-LNA) PCR clamp assay to determine the EGFR mutation, and immunostaining to detect the delE746-A750 and L858R mutation protein.\nOne hundred thirty-three patients with NSCLC were examined by immunostaining with EGFR mutation-specific antibodies, and by the PNA-LNA PCR clamp assay, using histological or cytological samples. The expression levels of immunostaining were classified as positive (score 2+), negative (score 0) or equivocal (score 1+), indicating questionable, negative or weak expression. Of these patients, 42 NSCLC patients received EGFR-TKIs treatment and we analyzed whether expression of mutant EGFR proteins was correlated with progression-free survival in patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs.\nIn the 133 samples, positive, negative and equivocal results for EGFR mutation-specific antibodies were observed in 37 patients (27.8%), 85 patients (63.9%) and 11 patients (8.3%), respectively. Thirty-seven patients showed positive EGFR expression by immunostaining, and 35 (94.6%) of these also tested positive in the DNA-based assay. Of 85 EGFR-negative patients by immunostaining, 77 (90.6%) also tested negative in the DNA-based assay. Of the 11 patients with equivocal immunostaining results, DNA-based assay detected EGFR mutation in 8 (72.7%) patients. Immunostaining for the EGFR mutation-specific antibodies showed a sensitivity of 81.4%, specificity of 97.5%, positive predictive value of 94.6% and negative predictive value of 90.6%, excluding the 11 patients with equivocal results. In NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs, the progression-free survival after the start of EGFR-TKIs treatment was significantly longer in patients with EGFR positive expression than in those with equivocal and negative expression (P\u003d0.002).\nOur results suggest that patients testing positive for EGFR mutations by immunostaining are good candidates for rapid response EGFR-TKI therapy. Immunostaining for EGFR mutation-specific antibodies is a new test for EGFR-TKI inhibition and could be a useful indicator with regard to patient management.","title":"A diagnostic algorithm using EGFR mutation-specific antibodies for rapid response EGFR-TKI treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22858448"}
