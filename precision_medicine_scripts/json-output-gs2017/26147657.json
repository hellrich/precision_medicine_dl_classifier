In addition, mutation status of IDH1/IDH2 is closely related to the progress and prognosis of certain tumors. Thus IDH1/IDH2 is considered to be a promising biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis and targeted therapy. In this study, the current research on IDH1/IDH2 mutation, especially the mechanisms and clinical characteristics related to tumor, are reviewed.
