Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are estimated to increase the risk for developing breast cancer by up to 87%. From a clinical point of view, identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers offers an opportunity to early identify or prevent the development of malignancy; therefore the ability to determine which women are more likely to carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations is of great importance. The available diagnostic tests for mutation analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 are time- and labor-intensive, expensive, and do not allow the identification of all the functional mutations. We utilized the Fluorescent lifetime (FLT) imaging microscopy method which allows recognizing different cell populations, in order to distinguish between lymphocytes from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and non-carrier women by using easily obtainable lymphocyte cells from peripheral blood. Our results demonstrate that cells originated from BRCA2-mutation carriers have significantly lower FLT values compared with BRCA1 mutation carriers and control cells. This simple, inexpensive and sensitive method may be utilized in the future to detect BRCA2 mutation carriers, particularly those bearing unknown functional mutations.","title":"Utilizing fluorescent life time imaging microscopy technology for identify carriers of BRCA2 mutation.","pubmedId":"27721065"}
