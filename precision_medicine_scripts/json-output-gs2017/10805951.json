We will review what is currently known about the clinical management of patients who bear (or are suspected of bearing) mutations in either of these two genes. The issues related to establishing a diagnosis of inherited breast cancer, deciding which women are candidates for testing, the limitations of testing, and the predictive power of these tests are addressed. The prognostic features of cancers associated with a BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation are reviewed. Further, guidelines for prophylaxis of women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation are given and recommendations are made for the care of mutation carriers with cancer.","title":"Clinical management of BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancer.","pubmedId":"10805951"}
