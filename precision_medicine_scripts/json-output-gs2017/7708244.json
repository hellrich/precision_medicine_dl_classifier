The clue to the correct diagnosis of congestive enlargement of the breast is the presence of \u0027pitting\u0027 edema, which is not found in malignant breast edema. Resolution of the breast enlargement usually occurs when the heart failure is properly treated.","title":"[Unilateral edema of the breast secondary to congestive heart failure.
