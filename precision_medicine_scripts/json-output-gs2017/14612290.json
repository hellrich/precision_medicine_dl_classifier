The data were analyzed together with clinical findings.\nThe positive expression rates of p21 and p53 proteins were 75.0% and 57.3% respectively in pancreatic carcinoma, which were significantly different from those in the normal tissue (P\u003c0.05). p21 and p53 proteins were positively correlated (P\u003c0.05). The positive expression of PCNA was 43.33%+/-17.99%, that was significantly higher than that in the normal pancreatic tissue (P\u003c0.05). The expression of PCNA was correlated with the histological grade (P\u003c0.05). The positive expression rate was consistent with the exacerbation of cancer. The expression was also correlated significantly with prognosis and p53 expression (P\u003c0.05).\nThe occurrence and development of pancreatic cancer are the result of associated function for many oncogenes and antioncogenes. PCNA may be helpful to identify malignant degree and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Clinical significance of expression of p21 and p53 proteins and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"14612290"}
