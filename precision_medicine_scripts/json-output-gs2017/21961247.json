Postoperative pathology confirmed the case to be s SCL. Neither recurrence nor metastasis was found during the five-month follow-up.\nSCL is a rare medical condition with no specific imaging and laboratory features. Radical orchidectomy with wide local excision of the mass is recommended for its treatment, and adjuvant radiotherapy can be considered in intermediately or highly differentiated tumors and recurrent liposarcomas, while the role of chemotherapy is not well-defined.","title":"[Spermatic cord liposarcoma: a case report and review of the literature].","pubmedId":"21961247"}
