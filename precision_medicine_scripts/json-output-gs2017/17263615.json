The gold standard of treatment remains surgical excision.\nWe describe the first successful removal of a well-differentiated retroperitoneal liposarcoma using a laparoscopic approach. An asymptomatic patient presented a large fatty mass in the retroperitoneal space on CT imaging. A transperitoneal laparoscopic approach was planned. A well-capsulated mass was exposed under Gerota\u0027s fascia that was dissected easily and removed completely without complications. Histologic examination revealed a well-differentiated liposarcoma. No recurrence was found at 12 months\u0027 followup.\nResecting the mass completely remains the most important predictor of local recurrence and overall survival in liposarcoma. Thus, the success of radical surgical treatment is very important. The laparoscopic approach is technically safe and successful in maintaining oncologic principles and avoiding recurrences in retroperitoneal liposarcomas, representing a feasible alternative to open surgery.","title":"Case report: Laparoscopic removal of 10-cm retroperitoneal liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"17263615"}
