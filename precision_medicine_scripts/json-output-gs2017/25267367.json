While the association is well established in females, the same cannot be said for the male breast cancer due to paucity of cases. With only two cases reported previously, our knowledge is sparse. We hereby report two cases of male breast cancer with neurofibromatosis. ","title":"Neurofibromatosis with male breast cancer--risk factor or co-incidence?
