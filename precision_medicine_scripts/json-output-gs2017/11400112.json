The complex formed by CDK4 and cyclin D1 has been strongly implicated in the control of cell proliferation and prognoses in human malignancies. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of cyclin D1, CDK4 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in 102 patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Cyclin D1 overexpression was observed in 59 cases (57.8%) of LSCC, and was significantly correlated with tumor site, tumor size, lymph node metastasis and advanced stage. CDK4 overexpression was observed in 48 cases (47.1%), and was significantly correlated with tumor size and advanced stage. Cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression was significantly associated with cell proliferation measured by PCNA (r \u003d 0.812, p \u003c 0.0001 and r \u003d 0.725, p \u003c 0.0001, respectively). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that cyclin D1 overexpression was significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival. CDK4 overexpression was significantly associated with overall survival. When cyclin D1 and CDK4 are combined, the patients with co-overexpression of cyclin D1-CDK4 revealed the poorest overall survival. Additionally, in early-stage (I-II) cases, co-overexpression of cyclin D1-CDK4 was also revealed to possess a significant prognostic role. By multivariate analysis, cyclin D1 overexpression, lymph node metastasis and advanced stage were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival. Cyclin D1 overexpression, CDK4 overexpression, tumor grade, lymph node metastasis and advanced stage were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. These findings indicate that cyclin D1 and CDK4 overexpression and/or co-overexpression of these proteins may play a pivotal role in the biological behavior of LSCC and may provide a strong prognostic implication.","title":"Cyclin D1-CDK4 complex, a possible critical factor for cell proliferation and prognosis in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas.","pubmedId":"11400112"}
