However, several studies have demonstrated lower adenoma detection rates in women than in men. Many questions arise about differences in adenomas, CRC, and screening practices between men and women: should screening be the same for both sexes, are there differences in risk factors in the formation of colon cancer, should special groups of women be screened differently from the general population, are colonoscopies tolerated differently in women and why, and what determines if a woman will undergo colonoscopy? This article reviews these issues.","title":"Issues related to colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening practices in women.","pubmedId":"21601788"}
