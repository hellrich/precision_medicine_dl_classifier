We report a rare case of paratesticular liposarcoma with the clinical symptomatology of an inguinal hernia. The treatment was surgical and included radical orchiectomy and wide excision of the tumor mass to the macroscopically healthy margins. The patient is well and with no evidence of recurrence 1 year after the operation. We review the literature, and discuss the role of radical orchiectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy in the treatment of paratesticular liposarcomas.","title":"Paratesticular well-differentiated, adipocytic type liposarcoma presenting as inguinal hernia.","pubmedId":"15084775"}
