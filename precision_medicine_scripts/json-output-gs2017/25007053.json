This report describes a novel mouse model that overexpresses ERG and lacks PTEN with the majority of mice developing prostate tumors by 6 mo. Biological mechanisms suggest increased/altered binding of the male hormone receptor in the genome. This model will be useful in pre-clinical evaluation of new drugs targeting these common prostate cancer genomic alterations.
