{"genes":["PTEN","AR","EML4","ALK"],"publicationTypes":["2013 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background:  An increasing number of molecularly targeted drugs are now available in Phase I and II clinical trials. Many of these drugs target specific molecular abnormalities such as mutated, amplified or rearranged genes. Our hypothesis is that cancers that carry a molecular abnormality that corresponds to the mechanism of action of a given investigational drug are more sensitive to that particular drug than other cancers. The objective of this study is to perform molecular analysis of metastatic breast cancer biopsies (bx) using methods already established within CLIA approved laboratories, and to use the results to triage pts to various therapeutic clinical trials or standard of care therapy.  Methods:  Four core needle biopsies (CNB) and 4 fine needle aspirations (FNA), or 8 FNA are obtained from the most safely accessible metastatic site in a single bx session. Pathological confirmation of successful aspiration is performed. Two core bx (or 4 FNA passes) are formaldehyde fixed and paraffin embedded for Immunohistochemistry (IHC), FISH and mutation analysis (CMS11 or CMS46) and 4 FNA are placed in RNA-later and snap-frozen for transcriptional profiles and storage. Samples are transferred to the Molecular Diagnostic, IHC, and Cytogenetics Laboratories.  All reports are included in the electronic medical record.  Results:  FromFeb 2012 to Jan 2013, 142 pts referred, 128 pts registered, 101 bx completed and 78 (77%) bx with available results. Bx sites included: liver (37), lymph node (26), soft tissue (16), bone (13), lung (5), other (4).   Successful results were obtained for IHC: PTEN (73%), AR (78%), MET (73%), FISH: EML4-ALK (78%) and MET (74%), and mutation analysis (76%). To date, there have been no reported hospitalizations, ER visits, bleeding, pain, infection or organ dysfunction at the bx sites. 16 pts have been treated on trials with investigational agents hypothesized to result in response based upon the molecular profile of the tumor.  Conclusions:  Prospective tissue collection to determine the molecular targets and to evaluate pts for clinical trial selection is feasible and safe.","title":"Breast cancer evaluation and targeted investigational therapy (BEAT-IT): A pilot prospective tissue testing to guide clinical trial selection.","pubmedId":"ASCO_114924-132"}
