Gene rearrangements are observed at low frequency, but there are a proportion of human cancers that are associated with c-erbB2 gene amplification and membrane protein overexpression. The human cancers so affected are adenocarcinomas of the breast, ovary, stomach, and bladder, with up to 20% of primary lesions exhibiting either increased gene copy number and/or excess membrane staining. The c-erbB2 protein on these tumors could be used as a therapeutic target, as in monoclonal antibody targetted therapy already being assessed in c-erbB2 positive breast cancer. Other possible therapeutic strategies include the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or ligand antagonists.","title":"c-erbB2 amplification and overexpression in human tumors.","pubmedId":"1360230"}
