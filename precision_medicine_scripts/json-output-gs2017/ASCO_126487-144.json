RET and ROS1 fusions have identified as new drivers of lung adenocarcinomas and these fusions are reported to be promising druggable targets. However, these gene fusions are encountered rather rarely, that is observed in only 1-2% of all lung adenocarcinomas. Methods:  This study was established in February 2013 as a new nationwide genomic screening project for developing individualized medicine of advanced NSCLC patients in Japan. Tumor samples of advanced EGFR mutation-negative non-squamous lung cancer patients were eligible for submission. The specimens were screened for RET, ROS1 and ALK fusions by RT-PCR and FISH methods. Results:  As of January 22th in 2014, The LC-SCRUM-Japan is under way with the participation of 158 institutions in Japan, under aid from the public research fund of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. 507 patients were enrolled to this study and 444 tumor samples of enrolled patients (88%) were screened. A gene fusion was detected in 52 (12%) of the 444 patients as follows; RET 21 (5%), ROS1 17 (4%), and ALK 14 (3%). We have synchronously initiated a phase II trial of vandetanib for advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients (LURET study) (UMIN000010095). Eight of 21 patients with positive for RET fusion determined in the LC-SCRUM-Japan have been already enrolled and just treated with vandetanib in the LURET study. In addition, we enrolled 5 of 17 patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC determined in the LC-SCRUM-Japan onto a global phase II trial of crizotinib for advanced ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC patients (OO12-01) (NCT01945021). Conclusions:  The prevalence of RET and ROS1 fusions in our enriched population was relatively higher compared with that reported in non-selected NSCLC population. This innovative screening project in Japan leads to the activation of screening for lung cancer with rare driver mutations and developing targeted therapy trials.
