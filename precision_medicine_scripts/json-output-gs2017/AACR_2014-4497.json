A majority of resistance mechanisms involve kinome reprograming to reactivate ERK downstream of inhibitor activity. Therefore, we hypothesized that directly targeting ERK would be an effective method for overcoming these resistance mechanisms. To address this possibility, we evaluated the sensitivity of a panel of mutant KRAS pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines to the highly selective SCH772984 ERK1/2 protein kinase inhibitor. First, we found that the anchorage-dependent growth of 6 of 12 cell lines were sensitive to SCH772984 treatment (IC50\u003c2 uM). Some sensitive PDAC lines were resistant to the AZD6244 MEK1/2-selective inhibitor, indicating different mechanisms of action of these two inhibitors. Second, we identified phospho-AKT as a potential biomarker for PDAC SCH772984 sensitivity. Third, we assessed the molecular basis for anchorage-dependent growth inhibition. After 72 h treatment, flow cytometry analyses indicated impaired cell cycle progression through G1. Additionally, we found increased apoptosis as measured by formation of cleaved caspase-3. Together these observations suggest that sensitivity is a result of both impaired cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly prolonged SCH772984 treatment (2 weeks) resulted in senescence, as sensitive lines stained positive for senescence-associated beta-galactocidase. Furthermore, we found that senescent cells induced p16 and lost phospho-RB two common markers associated with induction of senescence. Onset of senescence was dependent on the loss of total MYC protein expression. Finally, we found that treatment with SCH772984 reduced tumorigenic growth in an in vivo xenograft mouse model. Our ongoing studies include determining the mechanisms of inhibitor resistance. In summary, our findings suggest that targeting ERK will be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of KRAS mutant PDAC.","title":"Therapeutic benefit of targeting ERK in mutant KRAS pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4497"}
