In glioma, IDH1R132H is the most common mutation type, which is associated with younger patient age and longer patient survival compared to wild-type status. Sequencing analyses of carcinomas and lymphomas have detected IDH1 mutations in only a small fraction of cases. In those studies, IDH1R132H was also the most frequent mutation. The aim of the present study was to analyse a comprehensive series of human tumours for IDH1R132H mutation.\nA total of 1844 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumours, including carcinomas, sarcomas and haematopoietic tumours were investigated immunohistochemically using a mutation-specific antibody for IDH1(R132H). Our positive control series consisted of a collection of diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. No IDH1R132H mutation was found in this series.\nIDH1R132H mutations occur almost exclusively in glioma and acute myeloid leukaemia.","title":"Immunohistochemical analysis of 1844 human epithelial and haematopoietic tumours and sarcomas for IDH1R132H mutation.","pubmedId":"21707716"}
