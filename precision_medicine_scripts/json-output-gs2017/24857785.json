Sanger sequencing and peptide nucleic acid clamp polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to analyze EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations. We analyzed ALK, RET, and ROS1 rearrangements by fluorescent in situ hybridization or reverse transcriptase-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. After molecular screening, Ion Torrent NGS was performed in 31 cases harboring only EGFR exon 19 deletions (19DEL), an L858R mutation, or none of the above mutations.\nThe 31 samples were divided into four groups: (1) responders to EGFR-TKIs with only 19DEL or L858R (n\u003d15); (2) primary resistance to EGFR-TKI with only 19DEL or L858R (n\u003d4); (3) primary resistance to EGFR-TKI without any mutations (n\u003d8); (4) responders to EGFR-TKI without any mutations (n\u003d4). With NGS, all conventionally detected mutations were confirmed except for one L858R in group 2. Additional uncovered predictive mutations with NGS included one PIK3CA E542K in group 2, two KRAS (G12V and G12D), one PIK3CA E542K, one concomitant PIK3CA and EGFR L858R in group 3, and one EGFR 19DEL in group 4.\nTargeted NGS provided a more accurate and clinically useful molecular classification of NSLAs. It may improve the efficacy of EGFR-TKI therapy in lung cancer.","title":"Comparison of targeted next-generation sequencing with conventional sequencing for predicting the responsiveness to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy in never-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24857785"}
