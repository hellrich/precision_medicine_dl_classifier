We have investigated 37 sporadic malignant melanomas (15 primary cutaneous melanomas and 22 melanoma metastases) and 6 melanoma cell lines for mutations in the 3 Ras genes NRAS, KRAS and HRAS. All tumors and cell lines were additionally analyzed for mutation and expression of BRAF, which encodes a Ras-regulated serine/threonine kinase with oncogenic properties, as well as for expression of RASSF1A, which encodes a Ras-binding protein with tumor suppressor properties. Mutational analyses identified somatic NRAS mutations in 2 primary melanomas, 4 melanoma metastases and 2 cell lines. One melanoma metastasis showed a somatic KRAS mutation whereas HRAS mutations were not detected. Eight primary melanomas, 6 melanoma metastases and 4 melanoma cell lines carried BRAF mutations affecting the known hot-spot codon 599. None of the tumors or cell lines with BRAF mutation demonstrated NRAS or KRAS mutations. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR showed that 8 melanomas (3 primary tumors, 5 melanoma metastases) had reduced RASSF1A transcript levels of \u003c or \u003d50% relative to benign melanocytic nevi and normal skin. Three melanoma cell lines lacked detectable RASSF1A transcripts. The RASSF1A gene promoter was hypermethylated in these 3 cell lines as well as in 6 of 8 melanomas with reduced RASSF1A mRNA levels. Treatment of the cell lines with 5-aza-2\u0027-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A resulted in demethylation of the RASSF1A promoter and re-expression of RASSF1A transcripts. Most tumors and all cell lines with RASSF1A promoter methylation additionally carried BRAF or NRAS mutations, suggesting a synergistic effect of these aberrations on melanoma growth. Taken together, 57% of the investigated melanomas and 100% of the melanoma cell lines carried mutations in either NRAS, KRAS or BRAF. In addition, 22% of the melanomas and 50% of the cell lines showed reduced RASSF1A transcript levels. Thus, alterations of Ras pathway genes are of paramount importance in the pathogenesis of sporadic melanomas.","title":"Frequent alterations of Ras signaling pathway genes in sporadic malignant melanomas.","pubmedId":"14961576"}
