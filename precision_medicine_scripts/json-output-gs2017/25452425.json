These lesions are characterized by different levels of malignancy. Only radical surgery offers a chance of curing the disease. The aim of this study is to present the results of gastrointestinal stromal tumor treatment with minimally invasive surgery.\nThe study group included 27 patients operated laparoscopically on for gastrointestinal stromal tumor with laparoscopic surgery between September 2009 and December 2013. The most common location of the tumor was the stomach (21 patients, 77.8%) and the small intestine (4 patients, 14.8%). We analyzed early surgery results, the number and character of complications, lengths of hospital stays, histological types of the removed tumors, and long-term results of treatment.\nThere was no need for conversion to open surgery in any patient from the study group. Post-surgery complications occurred in 2 patients (7.4%). The median duration of the hospital stay was 4.5 days; none of the patients had to be readmitted to the hospital in the first 30 days after the procedure. In 26 out of 27 patients, microscopic examination confirmed the radicality of the surgical procedure (R0 resection). The mean size of the removed lesions was 4.1 cm. Using the Joensuu malignancy classification model, it was established that in 6 (22.2%) patients gastrointestinal stromal tumor was characterized by a very low level of malignancy, in 11 patients (40.7%) a low level, in 4 (14.9%) a medium level, and in 6 (22.2%) a high level. The average duration of follow-up was 13 months. During the observation period, there was no recurrence of the disease.\nMinimally invasive surgery in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors is possible and allows for satisfactory results both in terms of the postoperative course and the oncological quality of the procedure.","title":"Laparoscopic Surgery In The Treatment of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.","pubmedId":"25452425"}
