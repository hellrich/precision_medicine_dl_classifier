We also aimed to study mortality among individuals with HIV and to explore co-morbidities. The study population included all living persons who resided in Stockholm County, Sweden, as of 31 December 2012 (N \u003d 2,212,435). Information on all consultations between 2007 and 2012 was obtained from primary health care, specialist outpatient care and inpatient care. Analyses were done by age and gender. All patients with a recorded diagnosis of HIV were included. The prevalence of HIV was calculated using 2012 data. The prevalence of HIV in Stockholm area as per end of December 2012 was as low as 0.1% in females and 0.2% in males, and the annual incidence of HIV continued to decline over the years. In recent years, cancers, diabetes and hypertension were about as common in individuals with HIV as in the general population. Males with HIV had 3- to 4-fold higher age-adjusted odds of being diagnosed with depression and 3-fold higher odds of anxiety disorders and women had 1.6 to 2-fold higher age-adjusted odds of depression and anxiety disorders, than males and females in the general population, respectively. The relatively good somatic health observed in this study could be attributed to nearly optimal HIV therapy in Sweden. The mental health of HIV patients was significantly worse than that in the general population and needs further attention.
