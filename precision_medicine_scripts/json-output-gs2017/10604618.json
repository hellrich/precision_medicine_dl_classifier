Repeated laser therapy was used after endoscopic stenting, following investigation as described.\nGood periods of survival were seen with good palliation and no complications of treatment. The longest survival was 36 months (range 4-36, median 21). Duodenal obstruction was successfully relieved in one patient.\nThe treatment shows promise in selected patients, but conclusions are limited by the small numbers and lack of controls in this study.","title":"Laser ablation of ampullary carcinoma.","pubmedId":"10604618"}
