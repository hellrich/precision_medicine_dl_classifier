Here, we report a series of 4 cases of this rare event and discuss the relevant potential risk factors.\nWe performed a retrospective review of patients treated for scalp metastases of meningiomas at our institution. A literature review was performed for the terms \"scalp meningioma,\" \"cutaneous meningioma,\" \"skin meningioma,\" \"extracranial meningioma,\" and \"subcutaneous meningioma.\"\nFour patients showed scalp metastases of recurrent meningiomas with the following associated clinical features: multiple reoperations (n \u003d 4), immunosuppression (n \u003d 2), radiation therapy (n \u003d 3), surgical wound complications with cerebrospinal fluid fistula (n \u003d 2), and histologic grade progression (n \u003d 2). The timescale for development of scalp metastasis was between 5 months and 13 years after intracranial meningioma surgery. In all cases, the metastases were located close to the surgical scalp incision for the craniotomy. Previously, 11 cases of meningioma with scalp metastasis, with similar features to those described here, were reported in the literature.\nSpreading of meningioma cells during surgery is a possible mechanism for scalp metastases of recurrent meningiomas. Factors associated with scalp metastases include reoperations, immunosuppression, radiation therapy, torpid course of the surgical wound with cerebrospinal fluid fistula, and histologic progression. Awareness of these features is advisable for neurosurgeons involved in the care of patients with similar profiles.","title":"Scalp Metastases of Recurrent Meningiomas: Aggressive Behavior or Surgical Seeding?","pubmedId":"25765926"}
