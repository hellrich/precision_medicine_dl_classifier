In all cases thus far examined (n \u003d 10), the t(8;13) results in an identical mRNA fusion between ZNF198 exon 17 and FGFR1 exon 9. To determine if consistent fusions are also seen in the variant translocations, we performed RT-PCR on four cases and sequenced the products. For two patients with a t(8;9), we found that CEP110 exon 15 was fused to FGFR1 exon 9. For two patients with a t(6;8), we found that FOP exon 5 (n \u003d 1) or exon 7 (n \u003d 1) was fused to FGFR1 exon 9. To determine if FGFR1 might be involved in other myeloid disorders with translocations of 8p, we developed a two-color FISH assay using two differentially labeled PAC clones that flank FGFR1. Disruption of this gene was indicated in a patient with a t(8;17)(p11;q25) and Ph-negative chronic myeloid leukemia in association with systemic malignant mast cell disease, a patient with acute myeloid leukemia with a t(8;11)(p11;p15), and two cases with T-cell lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorder, and marrow eosinophilia with a t(8;12)(p11;q15) and ins(12;8)(p11;p11p21), respectively. For the patient with the t(8;11), the chromosome 11 breakpoint was determined to be in the vicinity of NUP98. We conclude that 1) all mRNA fusions in EMS result in splicing to FGFR1 exon 9 but breakpoints in FOP are variable, 2) two-color FISH can identify patients with EMS, and 3) the t(8;17)(p11;q25), t(8;11)(p11;p15), t(8;12)(p11;q15), and ins(12;8)(p11;p11p21) are novel karyotypic changes that most likely involve FGFR1.","title":"Identification of four new translocations involving FGFR1 in myeloid disorders.","pubmedId":"11550283"}
