There are several compounds targeting FGFR1 on the horizon. Here, we report changes in FGFR1 overexpression/mutation and anti-FGFR compound sensitivity in RCC. Methods:  Twenty-eight female NCr nu/nu mice (6-12 weeks of age) were used for xenotransplantation of human clear cell renal carcinoma Caki-1 cell line. Mice with established FGFR1-expressing tumors (an average size of 80-120 mg) received intravenous OM-RCA-01 (humanized anti-FGFR1 monoclonal antibody, 10 mg/kg, twice a week; N\u003d14) or oral ponatinib (pan-FGFR inhibitor, 30 mg/kg, daily; N\u003d14). Tumor sizes were measured in a blind fashion twice a week with a vernier caliper. Additionally, primary tumor and metastatic lesion of 40 RCC patients were accessed. Animal and patient formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of tumors were evaluated by immunohistochemistry with FGFR1 antibodies. FGFR1 mutations were assessed by PCR and direct sequencing. Results:  At in vivo study termination day (Day 31), there were 6 (43%) and 5 (36%) tumors reached end-point volume of 2000 mm3 in OM-RCA-01 and ponatinib groups, respectively. Nine (82%) of these 11 resistant tumors had no FGFR1 expression (5 and 4 tumors in OM-RCA-01 and ponatinib groups). FGFR1 was highly expressed in all 17 tumors that responded to OM-RCA-01 or ponatinib. Intensity was 3+ in all cases. Expression of FGFR1 was observed in 92.5% (37/40) of primary tumors and in 65% (26/40) of metastasis in RCC patients. FGFR1 expression decreased in 32% (12/37) and increased in 67% (2/3) of metastasis in comparison with primary tumors. No FGFR1 mutations were detected in animal and patient tumors. Conclusions:  FGFR1 overexpression could be different in primary RCC and metastasis of same patient. Expression of FGFR1 was found in 100% of renal tumors that responded to anti-FGFR therapy and in 18% of resistant RCC. Further translational studies will provide more information.","title":"FGFR1 overexpression and anti-FGFR compound sensitivity in renal cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_126023-144"}
