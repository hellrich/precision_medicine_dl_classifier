Serum protein biomarkers and ctDNA were analyzed for the correlation with the outcomes of dovitinib in a phase II study for TKI-refractory GIST (Br J Cancer 2013;109:2309).  Methods:  In total of 30 pts, predose serum samples were collected at day 1 of cycle 1 (n\u003d30) and cycle 2 (28). Eight serum proteins were assessed by ELISA (Table 1).  Mutation analysis was performed via BEAMing from ctDNA, isolated from baseline samples. Pts were classified by quartiles (Q) of biomarker levels and grouped as appropriate for the analyses.  Results:  With dovitinib treatment, FGF23, VEGF, VEGF-A, PIGF, and IL-8 increased by 1.5 fold (p\u003d0.02), 1.3 (p\u003d0.006), 1.3 (p\u003d0.004), 6.0 (p\u003d0.002), and 1.8 (p\u003d0.04), respectively, and sVEGFR2 decreased by 0.8 fold (p\u003d0.001) from baseline. Although baseline serum proteins were not associated with efficacy outcomes, pts whose sVEGFR2 decreased more (Q1-Q3) with dovitinib treatment showed better progression-free survival (PFS) than those with a smaller decrease (Q4; median 4.2 months [mo] vs 2.7 mo; p\u003d0.02). Primary KIT mutations were identified via serum in 5 pts (2 for exon 11, and 3 for exon 9), and 100% concordant with results via tissue. Secondary KIT mutations were detected in 11 pts (37%) via serum: 10 had mutations on exon 17/18 and one on both exon 13 and 17. The presence of secondary mutations showed a tendency for shorter PFS (median 3.4 mo vs 4.2 mo; p\u003d0.11) and significantly associated with shorter overall survival (median 5.5 mo vs 9.8 mo; p\u003d0.02).  Conclusions:  Dovitinib modulates serum levels of circulating proteins involved in VEGF and FGF signaling. The change of sVEGFR2 might predict the outcomes of dovitinib. Secondary KIT mutations could be successfully detected from ctDNA and was associated with poor prognosis.Protein nameAbbreviationSoluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1-2sVEGFR 1-2Vascular endothelial growth factor and type AVEGF, VEGF-APlacental growth factorPIGFBasic fibroblast growth factorbFGFFibroblast growth factor 23FGF 23Interleukin 8IL-8","title":"Analysis of serum protein biomarkers and circulating tumor (ct) DNA for activity of dovitinib in patients (pts) with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).","pubmedId":"ASCO_131675-144"}
