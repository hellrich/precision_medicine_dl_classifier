Discordant interpretations were adjudicated by another experienced neuroradiologist.\nThe least interobserver variability was found in measurements of thin-slice postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained at neurofibromatosis Type 2 centers in patients without previous operations and moderately sized tumors. If the schwannoma was difficult to assess, because of magnetic resonance imaging acquisition protocol, postoperative changes, or tumors smaller than 5 mm in greatest diameter, the neuroradiologist provided a more thorough assessment. The authors suggest uniform reporting criteria for vestibular schwannoma assessments to ensure clinically relevant information is communicated regarding vestibular schwannoma size.","title":"MRI evaluation of neurofibromatosis 2 patients: a standardized approach for accuracy in interpretation.","pubmedId":"16015177"}
