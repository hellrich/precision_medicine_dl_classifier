This CRC subtype is associated with poor outcome and with resistance, both to chemotherapeutic treatments and to tailored drugs.We recently showed that BRAF (V600E) colon cancers (CCs) have a characteristic gene expression signature (1, 2) which is found also in subsets of KRAS mutant and KRAS-BRAF wild type (WT2) tumors. Tumors having this gene signature, referred as BRAF-like,\" have a similar poor prognosis irrespective of the presence of the BRAF (V600E) mutation.By using a shRNA-based genetic screen in BRAF mutant CC cell lines we aimed to identify genes and pathways necessary for survival and growth of BRAF mutant CC. Such studies may reveal additional targets for therapy and potentially provide new biomarkers for patient stratification.MethodWe identified 363 genes that are selectively overexpressed in BRAF mutant tumors as compared to WT2 type tumors, based on gene expression profiles of the PETACC3 (1) and Agendia (1) datasets.The TRC human genome-wide shRNA collection (TRC-Hs1.0) was used to generate a 1815 hairpins sub-library targeting those identified genes (BRAF library). BRAF(V600E) CC cell lines were infected with the BRAF library and screened for shRNAs that cause lethality. LIM1215 CC cell line (WT2) was used as a control. Cells stably expressing the shRNA library were cultured for 13 days, after which shRNAs were recovered by PCR. Deep sequencing was applied to determine the specific depletion of shRNA in BRAF(V600E) cells as compared to LIM1215 cells.ResultsCandidate genes were identified by using following filtering criteria: depletion in BRAF(V600E) cells by at least 50% and depletion in BRAF(V600E) cells 1,5-fold higher than in control cells with the corresponding p-value to be  0.1. A total of 34 genes met our criteria of which 6 genes were presented with more than one hairpin and were concordant across the cell lines selected for validation.ConclusionWe identified candidate synthetic lethal genes in BRAF mutant CC cell lines. Functional analysis is ongoing. Data will be presented.","title":"Identification of synthetic lethal interactions with the BRAF oncogene in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-1219"}
