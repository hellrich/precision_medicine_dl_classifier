As few studies of the clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with ALK rearrangements have been reported, we conduct this study to gain more understanding in such area among Chinese patients.\nWe undertook a retrospective study of 288 non-small-cell lung cancer patients admitted to our institution over a period of 4.5 years.\nFollowing testing, 14.9% of the patients (43/288) were found to be ALK fusion gene positive. Patient data including gender, age, smoking status, EGFR mutation status and medical imaging data were collected and analyzed.\nThe findings suggested that patients with ALK rearrangements are more likely to be young, have EGFR wild-type, and more likely to exhibit mucus secretion, solid tumor growth, lymph node metastasis and pleural metastasis.","title":"Clinical characteristics associated with non-small-cell lung cancer harboring ALK rearrangements in Chinese patients.","pubmedId":"26888425"}
