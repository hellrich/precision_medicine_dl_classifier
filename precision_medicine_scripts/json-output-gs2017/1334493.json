To facilitate analysis of HGF and its receptor (HGFr), we expressed and purified a chimeric protein containing the extracellular domain (ECD) of the HGFr fused to the constant region of IgG heavy chain. This soluble form of the HGFr (sHGFr) bound HGF with an affinity similar to that of the authentic, membrane-associated receptor. The sHGFr also neutralized the binding of HGF to the HGFr expressed on A549 cells. Like the mature form of the HGFr, sHGFr is a heterodimer which arises by proteolytic processing within the ECD. In order to characterize the requirements for proteolytic processing of the ECD and the effects of cleavage on ligand binding, we expressed sHGFr variants containing amino acid substitutions in the putative processing site. Replacement of the P1 or P4 arginine, but not the P3 lysine, with alanine inhibited conversion to the alpha/beta heterodimer. This suggests that maturation is mediated by furin or a furin-like protease. Finally, we showed that processing of the sHGFr into the alpha/beta form is not required for high affinity binding to either pro- or mature HGF.","title":"Expression and characterization of hepatocyte growth factor receptor-IgG fusion proteins.
