It is well- known that patients harboring the KRAS mutation do not derive benefit from cetuximab. However data available KRAS mutation profile is limited to Caucasian and Asian individuals and there is a lack of data in the population from Latin America. Brazilian population has a heterogeneous genetic background and this may have pharmacogenetic implications (Suarez-Kurtz, 2006). Methods: Between July and November 2008, we analyzed 989 consecutive patient samples sent to our laboratory for KRAS genotyping as a screening for cetuximab use. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue, exons 1 were amplified by PCR and submitted to automatic sequencing. Codons 12 and 13 were analyzed. Results: The median age was 59 years and 53% of the patients were male and 47% female. The percentage of wild-type and mutated KRAS was 62 and 38%, respectively. Among the 375 mutated cases, 87% were in codon 12 versus 13% in codon 13. Mutation Gly12Asp was the most common being detected in 39% of the mutated cases. Due to the sample size a comparison among patients from different regions of Brazil was possible. However, no significant difference was observed in relation to the type or percentage of patients harboring the KRAS mutation. Interestingly, a significant difference in the percentage of mutated KRAS patients was observed between male and female (41 versus 35%, p\u003d 0.05). Conclusions: The profile of KRAS mutation in the Brazilian population is similar to that reported for Caucasian and Asian populations. This is one of the largest cohorts of KRAS genotyping in colorectal cancer patients ever reported. To the best of our knowledge our data is the first to put forward the issue of a potential difference in the mutation rate according to gender. The observed higher incidence of KRAS-mutation in male than female deserves further investigation.","title":"KRAS mutation profile in colorectal cancer patients in Brazil: A cohort of 989 individuals.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32446-65"}
