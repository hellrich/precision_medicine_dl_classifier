We aim to determine the treatment outcomes and prognostic factors for PM-RMS patients who treated with RT. In addition, we tried to evaluate the adequate dose and timing of RT.\nTwenty-two patients with PM-RMS from 1995 to 2013 were evaluated. Seven patients had intracranial extension (ICE) and 17 patients had skull base bony erosion (SBBE). Five patients showed distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. All patients underwent chemotherapy and RT. The median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 40.0 to 56.0 Gy).\nThe median follow-up was 28.7 months. Twelve patients (54.5%) experienced failure after treatment; 4 local, 2 regional, and 6 distant failures. The 5-year local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) were 77.7% and 38.5%, respectively. The 5-year OS rate was 50.8% for patients without distant metastases and 0% for patients with metastases (p \u003c 0.001). Radiation dose (\u003c50 Gy vs. â‰¥50 Gy) did not compromise the LC (p \u003d 0.645). However, LC was affected by ICE (p \u003d 0.031). Delayed administration (\u003e22 weeks) of RT was related to a higher rate of local failure (40.0%).\nRT resulted in a higher rate of local control in PM-RMS. However, it was not extended to survival outcome. A more effective treatment for PM-RMS is warranted.","title":"The impact of radiotherapy on clinical outcomes in parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma.","pubmedId":"27609110"}
