The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the objective response rate, overall survival, patient-reported outcomes, and safety.\nThe median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the sunitinib group (11 months) than in the interferon alfa group (5 months), corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.54; P\u003c0.001). Sunitinib was also associated with a higher objective response rate than was interferon alfa (31% vs. 6%, P\u003c0.001). The proportion of patients with grade 3 or 4 treatment-related fatigue was significantly higher in the group treated with interferon alfa, whereas diarrhea was more frequent in the sunitinib group (P\u003c0.05). Patients in the sunitinib group reported a significantly better quality of life than did patients in the interferon alfa group (P\u003c0.001).\nProgression-free survival was longer and response rates were higher in patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer who received sunitinib than in those receiving interferon alfa (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00098657 and NCT00083889 [ClinicalTrials.gov]).","title":"Sunitinib versus interferon alfa in metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17215529"}
