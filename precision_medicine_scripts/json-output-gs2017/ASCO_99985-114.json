Three targets, which together occur in up to 50% of SQCLC, have been recently identified (FGFR1 amplification, DDR2 mutations, PIK3CA mutations/PTEN loss).  Comprehensive molecular analysis of SQCLC tumors by The Cancer Genome Atlas is ongoing, with new therapeutic targets on the horizon.  Methods:    We have instituted prospective, multiplex testing of SQCLC tumors (Squamous Cell Lung Cancer Mutation Analysis Program, SQ-MAP).  Tests include FISH for FGFR1 amplification (defined as FGFR1:CEP8  2 in \u003e10% of cells), IHC for loss of PTEN expression, and Sequenom MassARRAY for PIK3CA mutations (and others, below).  We are also incorporating targeted exon sequencing (Agilent SureSelect/Ion Torrent) of a panel of over 80 lung cancer oncogenes and tumor suppressors in preparation for future studies.  All tests were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples and with Institutional Review Board/Biospecimen Utilization Committee approval.   Results:    40 SQCLC patient specimens have been processed through SQ-MAP over 3 months.  8 samples were excluded (insufficient tissue in 4, reclassification to ADCL in 4).  Data are available for 28 patients.  PTEN IHC was performed on 15 samples to date.  Molecular results are summarized in the table.   Events were non-overlapping.  Results for the 80 gene sequencing component will be described.  Based on SQ-MAP, accrual to 2 approved clinical trials (FGFR1 inhibition; PI3K inhibition) has begun, with a third planned (DDR2 mutations).   Conclusions:    Actionable defects were detected in 60% (95% CI: 37-75%) of SQCLC specimens.  Mutation data for 80 other oncogenes and tumor suppressors will be available shortly (including DDR2).  SQ-MAP serves as a platform supporting both personalized care and research.TestFrequency95% CIFGFR1 amplification25% (7/28)11-45%PTEN loss, complete20% (3/15)5-49%PIK3CA mutation11% (3/28)2-28%KRAS mutation4% (1/28)0-18%EGFR mutation0%BRAF mutation0%HER2 mutation0%AKT1 mutation0%NRAS mutation0%MEK1 mutation0%Any60%37%-75%","title":"Multiplex testing for driver mutations in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.","pubmedId":"ASCO_99985-114"}
