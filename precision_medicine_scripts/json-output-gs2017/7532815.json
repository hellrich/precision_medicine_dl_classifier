Nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-containing neurons were visualized by immunocytochemistry using antibodies against neuronal NOS in the oesophagus, the gastrointestinal tract and the coeliac ganglion of rat. NOS-containing nerve cell bodies were numerous in the myenteric but fewer in the submucous ganglia all along the gut. Synthesis of NOS in enteric nerve cell bodies was confirmed by in situ hybridization, demonstrating the presence of NOS mRNA. Varicose nerve fibers formed extensive networks in the circular smooth muscle and the myenteric ganglia. The pyloric sphincter contained abundant NOS-containing nerve fibers. NOS-containing nerve terminals were frequently found around the Brunner glands in the duodenum; scattered nerve terminals occurred in the gastric and colonic mucosa and around blood vessels in the submucosa all along the gut. The neuronal cell bodies in the coeliac ganglion were non-immunoreactive but frequently surrounded by baskets of NOS-immunoreactive nerve fibers. Double staining for NOS and neuropeptides in oesophagus, stomach and small and large intestine revealed that a small subpopulation of the NOS-containing nerve cell bodies stored in addition vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and in oesophagus, stomach and small intestine also neuropeptide Y (NPY). However, NOS-containing nerve terminals, particularly those in the circular muscle of the gut, frequently contained VIP throughout the gut; in the oesophagus, stomach and the small intestine they contained also NPY.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"NOS-containing neurons in the rat gut and coeliac ganglia.","pubmedId":"7532815"}
