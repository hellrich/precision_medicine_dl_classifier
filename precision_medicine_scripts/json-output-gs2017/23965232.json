The prevalence of driver gene mutations in the different subtypes is controversial. High-grade serous carcinomas show frequent TP53 mutations, whereas KRAS and BRAF mutations are less common. In non-serous EOC, the relevance of these gene mutations remains to be elucidated.\nWe investigated 142 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded EOC, including serous (n\u003d63), endometrioid (n\u003d29), clear cell (n\u003d25), mucinous (n\u003d14), and others (n\u003d11) for mutations in TP53 exons 5-8, KRAS exons 2 and 3, and BRAF exon 15 by pyro-sequencing using the GS Junior 454 platform. The mutational status was correlated with clinicopathological features and patient overall survival.\nWe identified mutations in the coding region of TP53 in 51.4% (73/142), and of KRAS in 9.9% (14/142) but not of BRAF. TP53 mutations occurred frequently not only in high-grade serous carcinomas (58.7%), but also in mucinous (57%) and clear cell EOC (52%). TP53 mutations were associated with high-grade carcinomas (p\u003d0.014), advanced FIGO stage (p\u003d0.001), intraoperative residual disease \u003e1cm (p\u003d0.004), as well as poor overall survival (p\u003d0.002). KRAS mutations were mainly identified in mucinous EOC (57%) and were concomitantly with TP53 mutations in five mucinous carcinomas (36%).\nTP53 gene driver mutations are a common feature of all advanced ovarian cancer subtypes, whereas BRAF mutations seem to be a rare event in EOC. KRAS mutations with synchronous TP53 mutations occur predominantly in low-grade mucinous carcinomas, suggesting a specific molecular background of this ovarian cancer type.","title":"TP53 mutations are common in all subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer and occur concomitantly with KRAS mutations in the mucinous type.","pubmedId":"23965232"}
