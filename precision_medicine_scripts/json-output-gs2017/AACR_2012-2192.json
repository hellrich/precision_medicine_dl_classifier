Specifically, genetic alterations, such as amplification, and the subsequent over-expression of genes encoding epigenetic modifying enzymes can directly lead to histone code changes that may be critical for cancer progression. KDM5A (lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5A, also known as RBP2 and JARID1A) was originally identified as the retinoblastoma-binding protein (RBP) implicated in the regulation of retinoblastoma target genes. Recently, several groups discovered that KDM5A is a member of a set of newly identified histone demethylases that control the chromatin-mediated regulation of gene expression. Specifically, KDM5A can function as a transcriptional repressor through the demethylation of tri- and dimethylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) active marks. In this study, we observed a significant amplification and over-expression of the KDM5A gene in various tumors, including breast cancer. We found that breast cancer cells with KDM5A gene amplification had intrinsic drug resistance properties and knocking down KDM5A with shRNAs improved the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors against these breast cancer cells. Further, up-regulation of KDM5A modified the histone methylation status and altered the expression of a subset of key genes, including the tumor suppressor p21 and the apoptotic effector BAK1, in breast cancer. Our findings suggest that alteration of the KDM5A gene may have a critical role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.","title":"Genomic amplification and drug-resistance roles of the KDM5A histone demethylase gene in breast cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2192"}
