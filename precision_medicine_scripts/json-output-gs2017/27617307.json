ERG status as determined by a genetically validated IHC assay was available for a subset of 938 tumors.\nAssociations between PTEN and ERG status were assessed using Fisher\u0027s exact test. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate weighted Cox proportional models for RFS were constructed.\nWhen compared to intact PTEN, homogeneous (hazard ratio [HR] 1.66, p \u003d 0.001) but not heterogeneous (HR 1.24, p \u003d 0.14) PTEN loss was significantly associated with shorter RFS in multivariate models. Among ERG-positive tumors, homogeneous (HR 3.07, p \u003c 0.0001) but not heterogeneous (HR 1.46, p \u003d 0.10) PTEN loss was significantly associated with shorter RFS. Among ERG-negative tumors, PTEN did not reach significance for inclusion in the final multivariate models. The interaction term for PTEN and ERG status with respect to RFS did not reach statistical significance (p \u003d 0.11) for the current sample size.\nThese data suggest that PTEN is a useful prognostic biomarker and that there is no statistically significant interaction between PTEN and ERG status for RFS.\nWe found that loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene in prostate tumors as assessed by tissue staining is correlated with shorter time to prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.","title":"PTEN Loss as Determined by Clinical-grade Immunohistochemistry Assay Is Associated with Worse Recurrence-free Survival in Prostate Cancer.","pubmedId":"27617307"}
