PCR assays targeting the 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) of \"T. whippelii\" are increasingly being applied for this purpose. Compared to microscopic analysis, PCR seems to be more sensitive, as indicated by the fact that several cases of Whipple\u0027s disease with negative histopathological findings but positive PCR results have been reported. Considering the lack of pathognomonic clinical features for this disease and the fact that \"T. whippelii\" DNA has repeatedly been found in patients without clinical Whipple\u0027s disease, such PCR results should be confirmed by additional tests. We have, therefore, evaluated a \"T. whippelii\"-specific nested PCR targeting domain III of the 23S rDNA with 41 clinical specimens known to contain \"T. whippelii\" 16S rDNA. All of these specimens were also positive for \"T. whippelii\" 23S rDNA. The specificity of the test was shown by sequencing of the amplicons and by the absence of amplicons in 38 negative controls. We consider this PCR test to be a suitable tool for confirming the presence of \"T. whippelii\" DNA in specimens with inconclusive histopathological findings. The information derived from sequencing of the partial \"T. whippelii\" 23S rDNA was then combined with our recent data of the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region of this organism. Overall, four different rDNA types are recognized in our proposed classification system for molecular variants of \"T. whippelii.\" This preliminary scheme may provide a basis for further epidemiological and clinical studies with \"T. whippelii\" and associated diseases.","title":"Evaluation of a specific nested PCR targeting domain III of the 23S rRNA gene of \"Tropheryma whippelii\" and proposal of a classification system for its molecular variants.","pubmedId":"10655352"}
