We studied EZH2 expression by immunohistochemistry in a large series of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) in association with tumor characteristics and patient outcomes.\nEZH2 immunohistochemistry expression was analyzed in 265 normal and premalignant bronchial epithelia, 541 primary NSCLCs [221 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 320 adenocarcinomas] and 36 NSCLCs with paired brain metastases. An independent set of 91 adenocarcinomas was also examined. EZH2 expression was statistically correlated with clinico-pathological information, and EGFR/KRAS mutation status.\nEZH2 expression was significantly (P \u003c 0.0001) higher in SCCs compared with adenocarcinomas and in brain metastasis relative to matched primary tumors (P \u003d 0.0013). EZH2 expression was significantly (P \u003c 0.0001) elevated in bronchial preneoplastic lesions with increasing severity. In adenocarcinomas, higher EZH2 expression significantly correlated with younger age, cigarette smoking, and higher TNM stage (P \u003d 0.02 to P \u003c 0.0001). Higher EZH2 expression in adenocarcinoma was associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS; P \u003d 0.025; HR \u003d 1.54) and overall survival (OS; P \u003d 0.0002; HR \u003d 1.96). Furthermore, lung adenocarcinomas with low EZH2 levels and high expression of the lineage-specific transcription factor, TTF-1, exhibited significantly improved RFS (P \u003d 0.009; HR \u003d 0.51) and OS (P \u003d 0.0011; HR \u003d 0.45), which was confirmed in the independent set of 91 adenocarcinomas.\nIn lung, EZH2 expression is involved in early pathogenesis of SCC and correlates with a more aggressive tumor behavior of adenocarcinoma. When EZH2 and TTF-1 expressions are considered together, they serve as a prognostic marker in patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas.","title":"EZH2 protein expression associates with the early pathogenesis, tumor progression, and prognosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24097870"}
