{"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Peritonitis due to peptic ulcer perforation is a surgical emergency with a high risk of mortality and morbidity.\nWe present a rare case of a 54-year-old Caucasian man who underwent an emergency laparotomy for peritonitis caused by perforation of two peptic ulcers. The first was located on the anterior wall of the duodenum and the second was posterior, pre-pyloric, close to the lesser curvature.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report in the medical literature of a simultaneous perforation of two peptic ulcers; though rare, every surgeon performing open or laparoscopic repair of a perforated peptic ulcer should be aware of the possibility of simultaneous perforation.","title":"Synchronous perforation of a duodenal and gastric ulcer: a case report.","pubmedId":"20718951"}
