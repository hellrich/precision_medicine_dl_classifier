There was a strong correlation between c-erbB2 gene amplification and FIGO stage of human ovarian carcinoma (P \u003d 0.026), degree of cell differentiation (P \u003d 0.011) and the size of residual tumor (P \u003c 0.001). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that c-erbB2 gene amplification was an independent prognostic factor. The average 3-year survival rate was 28.4% in patients with gene amplification and 57.7% in patients without gene amplification(P \u003d 0.016).\nc-erbB2 gene amplification occurs almost in 1/3 of the patients with ovarian carcinoma examined. Ovarian carcinoma with c-erbB2 gene amplification is highly malignant and associated with poor prognosis.","title":"[c-erbB2 gene amplification in human primary epithelial ovarian cancer and its clinical significance].","pubmedId":"10921034"}
