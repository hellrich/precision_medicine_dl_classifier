Some amplicons contain well-characterized oncogenes, including 11q13 (CCND1) and 17q12 (HER2). HER2 amplification and overexpression defines the HER2+ subgroup of breast cancer patients and is both a prognostic marker for poor outcome and a predictive marker for response to anti-HER2 targeted therapies. Therefore, there is considerable interest in documenting the locations of other recurring amplifications in breast cancers as they may also provide a rich source of new biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for these subgroups. This article focuses on the genomic profiling of breast cancer, with an emphasis on the characteristics of the amplifications found in subtypes of breast cancer, including luminal (ER+)/HER2(-)), HER2+ and basal-like (ER(-)/HER2(-)), and discusses their known or potential roles in cancer biology and their clinical implications.","title":"DNA amplifications in breast cancer: genotypic-phenotypic correlations.","pubmedId":"20528234"}
