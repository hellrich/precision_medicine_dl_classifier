However, 15 cases of entirely dermal PL have been reported. We describe a case of a 79-year-old man who developed a rapidly growing nodule on his thorax. Excisional biopsy was performed and immunohistochemical studies were carried. The lesion was a well-circumscribed dermal nodule composed of multivacuolated pleomorphic lipoblasts and atypical mitotic figures. Neoplastic cells expressed CD10 and resulted negative S100 protein, Melan-A, MITF-1, AE1/AE3, CD4, CD68 (PGM1), retinoblastoma gene family protein, pericentrine and lysozyme. Adipophilin stain showed the lipid contents in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells. MDM2 and CDK4 resulted both negative. A diagnosis of primary dermal PL was made. This case shows the utility of adipophilin immunostaining to prove the lipid contents in neoplastic cells, which has the advantage of using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and making needless frozen sections and ultrastructural studies to show these findings. Negative MDM2/CDK4 staining in our case argues against the possibility of dedifferentiated liposarcoma and further supports the diagnosis of true PL.","title":"Primary dermal pleomorphic liposarcoma: utility of adipophilin and MDM2/CDK4 immunostainings.","pubmedId":"27778364"}
