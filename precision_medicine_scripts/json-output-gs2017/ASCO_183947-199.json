Preclinical studies suggested that addition of Bev to EGFR-TKIs could overcome AR, and Bev demonstrated synergistic effects with Afa in TKI-resistant xenograft models. Methods: ECOG PS 0-2 patients (pts) with EGFR-mutant NSCLC after AR to EGFR-TKIs were enrolled at any lines. Rebiopsy was essential to confirm T790M status after AR. Afa was prescribed at 30 mg, and Bev administered at 15 mg/kg tri-weekly until progression. Results: Between October 2014 and September 2016, 33 eligible pts were enrolled. Median age was 66 (range, 48-86). Twenty-one (64%) pts were female, and 22 (67%) were never smoker. Mutation subtypes were 20 (61%) Del-19, 12 (36%) L858R, and 1 (3%) L861Q. T790M was detected in 14 (42%) pts. Median number of prior regimens was 4 (range, 1-10). First prior TKIs were 20 (61%) gefitinib, 10 (30%) erlotinib or 3 (9%) Afa. Six pts obtained partial response and 23 stable disease, resulting in response rate (RR) of 18.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.0-35.5%) and disease control rated of 87.9% (95% CI, 71.8-96.6%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 5.9 (95% CI, 3.5-8.8) months and not reached, respectively. Median RR and PFS of T790M+ vs. T790M- were 14.3% vs. 21.2% (p \u003d 0.6189) and 6.2 vs. 5.2 months (p \u003d 0.8619), respectively. Median RR and PFS of Del-19 vs. L858R were 20.0% vs. 8.3% (p \u003d 0.3789) and 5.9 vs. 5.1 months (p \u003d 0.8996), respectively. Afa dosage was reduced to 20 mg in 15 (45%) pts and increased to 40 mg in 2 (6%) pts. Median number of Bev administrations was 6 (range, 1-14). Bev was interrupted in 5 (15%) pts. Adverse events grade 3: rash (3%); paronychia (24%); mucositis (6%); diarrhea (3%); liver dysfunction (3%); hypertension (39%); and proteinuria (15%) were observed. There were no treatment-related deaths, interstitial lung disease, nor Bev-associated severe bleedings. Conclusions: Afa + Bev demonstrated the efficacy and safety after AR to EGFR-TKIs. It could be a therapeutic salvage option for T790M- populations.
