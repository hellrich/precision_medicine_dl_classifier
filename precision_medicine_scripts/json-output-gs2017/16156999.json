Traditionally, cervical cancer is staged clinically and has been treated either by radical hysterectomy or by radiotherapy. Improvements in imaging have led to more accurate therapeutic decision making and treatment planning. The evidence on fertility-preserving surgery for cervical cancer and chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced cancer is summarized here. An improved understanding of the viral aetiology of cervical cancer has led to the development of therapeutic vaccination, with limited success. There is increasing recognition of the psychosexual needs of women who have survived cervical cancer.","title":"Advances in the management of cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"16156999"}
