Ghrelin promotes gastric emptying and secretion of growth hormone and inhibits inflammation. We assessed whether diabetes mellitus and serum levels of insulin, leptin, and ghrelin are associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett\u0027s esophagus.\nWe conducted a case-control study in 822 men undergoing colorectal cancer screening who were recruited to also undergo upper endoscopy. We identified 70 with Barrett\u0027s esophagus; 80 additional men with Barrett\u0027s esophagus were recruited shortly after their clinical diagnoses. Serum levels of insulin, leptin, and ghrelin were assayed in all 104 fasting men with Barrett\u0027s esophagus without diabetes and 271 without diabetes or Barrett\u0027s esophagus. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of diabetes and levels of insulin, leptin, and ghrelin on GERD and Barrett\u0027s esophagus.\nAmong men with GERD, diabetes was inversely associated with Barrett\u0027s esophagus (adjusted odds ratio [OR] \u003d 0.383; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.179-0.821). Among nondiabetics, hyperinsulinemia was positively associated with Barrett\u0027s esophagus, but the association was attenuated by adjustment for leptin and ghrelin. Leptin was positively associated with Barrett\u0027s esophagus, adjusting for obesity, GERD, and levels of insulin and ghrelin (OR for 3(rd) vs 1(st) tertile \u003d 3.25; 95% CI: 1.29-8.17); this association was stronger in men with GERD (P \u003d .01 for OR heterogeneity). Ghrelin was positively associated with Barrett\u0027s esophagus (OR for an increment of 400 pg/mL \u003d 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.76), but inversely associated with GERD (OR for 3(rd) vs 1(st) tertile \u003d 0.364; 95% CI: 0.195-0.680).\nBased on a case-control study, leptin was associated with Barrett\u0027s esophagus, particularly in men with GERD. Serum insulin level was associated with Barrett\u0027s esophagus, but might be mediated by leptin. Serum ghrelin was inversely associated with GERD, as hypothesized, but positively associated with Barrett\u0027s esophagus, contrary to our hypothesis. Additional studies are needed in men and women to replicate these findings.","title":"Associations of diabetes mellitus, insulin, leptin, and ghrelin with gastroesophageal reflux and Barrett\u0027s esophagus.","pubmedId":"23999171"}
