IL-1beta inhibited type II collagen expression, but activated CDK6. Ectopic expression of CDK2 did not alter type II collagen expression. However, overexpression of CDK6 inhibited type II collagen expression, whereas inhibition of CDK6 activity blocked IL-1beta-induced suppression of type II collagen expression. IL-1beta upregulated the expression of cyclin D1, which is known to activate CDK6. In turn, overexpression of cyclin D1 suppressed type II collagen expression. In contrast to cyclin D1, IL-1beta triggered down-regulation of the CDK inhibitor, p21. Overexpression of p21 blocked IL-1beta- or CDK6-induced suppression of type II collagen expression. Our results collectively indicate that CDK6/cyclin D1/p21 complex regulates type II collagen expression in articular chondrocytes.","title":"Regulation of type II collagen expression by cyclin-dependent kinase 6, cyclin D1, and p21 in articular chondrocytes.","pubmedId":"17454300"}
