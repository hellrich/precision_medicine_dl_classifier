However, as newer hormonal and chemotherapeutic regimens were developed, drug therapy gradually replaced surgery as the preferred treatment for metastatic breast cancer. Thus, management of metastatic breast cancer has largely shifted from surgeons to medical oncologists. Advances in hormonal pharmacology have placed hormonal therapy alongside surgery and radiation therapy as a standard treatment option for women with advanced breast cancer. The purpose of this article is to update surgeons on the current use of hormonal agents for treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and to review the aromatase inhibitors, a new line of hormonal agents for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.","title":"Use of aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.","pubmedId":"9369969"}
