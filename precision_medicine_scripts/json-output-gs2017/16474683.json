This disorder is often overlooked in comparison to other male sexual dysfunctions, principally because of its seeming rarity. Priapism, however, occurs frequently in certain patient populations, including those with hematologic dyscrasias. Most commonly, priapism affects patients with sickle cell disease. The reported prevalence rate in this group ranges between 29% and 42% of males. The significance of priapism is further emphasized by the fact that this disorder commonly causes erectile tissue damage and leads to the loss of functional erections. These observations highlight the need for proper clinical recognition of priapism in order to enable appropriate management. Here, the current knowledge of priapism as it relates to hematologic and coagulative diseases is discussed, with a focus on the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder.","title":"Therapy insight: Priapism associated with hematologic dyscrasias.","pubmedId":"16474683"}
