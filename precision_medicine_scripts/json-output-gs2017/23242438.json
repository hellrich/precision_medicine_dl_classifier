The tumors were classified according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification. EGFR and KRAS mutations were detected using the established methods.\nFive-year disease-free survival rates were: 100% for adenocarcinoma in situ (n \u003d 20) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 33), 93.8% for lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 36), 88.8% for invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 10), 66.7% for papillary-predominant adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 179), 69.7% for acinar-predominant adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 61), 43.3% for solid-predominant adencoarcinoma (n \u003d 78), and 0% for micropapillary-predominant adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 19). Multivariate analysis revealed that the new classification was an independent predictor of disease-free survival. EGFR and KRAS mutations were detected in 90 cases (53.9%) and 21 cases (13.3%), respectively; EGFR mutations were significantly associated with adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, lepidic- and papillary-predominant adenocarcinoma, and KRAS mutations adenocarcinomas with mucinous tumor subtypes.\nWe found that the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification identified prognostic histologic subtypes of lung adenocarcinomas among Japanese patients. Histologic subtyping and molecular testing for EGFR and KRAS mutations can help predict patient prognosis and select those who require adjuvant chemotherapy.","title":"Validation of the IASLC/ATS/ERS lung adenocarcinoma classification for prognosis and association with EGFR and KRAS gene mutations: analysis of 440 Japanese patients.","pubmedId":"23242438"}
