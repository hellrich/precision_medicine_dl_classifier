Never-smoking patients account for 15% of lung cancer patients, more often women and adenocarcinoma. Environmental tobacco smoke and occupational exposure could be important risk factors. Lung cancer in never-smoker appears to be a distinct entity from lung cancer in smoker, with specific molecular characteristics such as frequent EGFR mutations. New molecular targets are on investigation, such as EML4-ALK translocation. Treatment of lung cancer in never-smoker is getting different from that of smoker with more efficacy of molecular targeted therapies.","title":"[Lung cancer in never smoker: Epidemiology, molecular profiles and treatment].","pubmedId":"21420271"}
