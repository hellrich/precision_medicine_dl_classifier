Here, we identified a lipid raft protein DS-20, a crucial regulator of H-Ras activation, as a potential marker for invasive breast cancer. DS-20 (amino acid residues 1-38) interacted with H-Ras (residues 166-189) in lipid rafts and their interaction was important for H-Ras activation. DS-20 knockdown inhibited H-Ras activation and invasion in Hs578T triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) and T24 bladder carcinoma cells in which H-Ras is endogenously activated, suggesting a crucial role of DS-20 in the invasive program which relies on the activation of H-Ras. We further showed that DS-20 was required for epidermal growth factor-induced H-Ras activation, but not that of N-Ras, in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. Intravasation of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with shRNA DS-20 in the chick chorioallantoic membrane model was markedly reduced, indicating that DS-20 is required for an invasive capacity in vivo. In a xenograft mice tumor model, DS-20 was essential for in vivo tumor aggressiveness of Hs578T cells, suggesting DS-20 as a potential target for the treatment of breast cancer. Using human breast cancer samples, we provide clinical evidence for the tumorigenic potential of DS-20 and its association with H-Ras. Taken together, our findings provide a new insight into the molecular basis of Ras isoform-specific interplay with plasma membrane leading to cell invasion.","title":"Identification of a lipid raft protein that is required for H-Ras activation and breast cancer aggressiveness","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-5263"}
