Median follow-up was 22 months (1 to 91 months). The extent of surgery was complete resection in 23 patients (including 17 with orthotopic liver transplant), partial resection in 4, and biopsy in 34. All patients had radiotherapy; median dose was 49.5 Gy. Thirty patients received chemotherapy: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-leucovorin with interferon alpha (IFNalpha) in 27, and taxol in 3.\nThe median survival was 20 months (95% CI 15-25 months). The 5-year actuarial survival was 23.8 +/- 6.8%. The only significant variable in multivariate analysis was achieving a complete resection with negative margins through conventional surgery or liver transplantation (p \u003d 0.001, hazard rate ratio [HRR] \u003d 0.25, 95% CI 0.12-0.54). Patients with complete resections had a 5-year actuarial survival of 53.5 +/- 10.9%.\nCombined modality therapy that includes complete surgical resection with or without transplantation can be curative in the majority of patients with biliary duct carcinoma. Further study is needed to better define the roles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Radiotherapy and multimodality management of cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"10219804"}
