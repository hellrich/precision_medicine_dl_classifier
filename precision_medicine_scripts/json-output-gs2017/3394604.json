Although male breast cancer is 100 times less common than female breast cancer, the prognosis for men is worse than that for women, probably because of delay in diagnosis. Men with breast cancer have a high prevalence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.","title":"Breast cancer in men.","pubmedId":"3394604"}
