The present article describes the isolation, purification and sequence analysis of a protein released by LSA cells into conditioned culture medium. This protein proved to be a variant isoform of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), hence its designation as LSA-type-MnSOD. This LSA-type-SOD differed from conventional SODs in its secretion by producer cells, contrasting with the normal localization of SODs in the mitochondrial matrix. Interestingly, during the protein purification process, LSA-type-SOD cosegregated with a cytotoxic activity directed against a number of tumor cell lines, as determined under in vitro conditions. This cytopathic effect was most likely due to LSA-type-SOD, since it could be fully reproduced using recombinant SOD that was expressed from cDNA clones isolated from LSA cells mRNA preparations and henceforth designated L-rSOD. In addition to its manifestation in cell lines kept in tissue culture, the oncotoxicity of LSA-type-SOD was further reflected in a remarkable capacity of this protein for suppression of mammary tumors in Balb-C-FR(III) mice. Animals subcutaneously injected with L-rSOD in the tumor area showed a complete disruption of established mammary carcinomas, as monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scanning. Moreover, metastatic spreading, which was readily detected in the control group, was suppressed in the treated animals. Altogether these data suggest that LSA-type-SOD interferes with survival and spreading of neoplastically transformed cells and deserves to be future validated as a therapeutic agent against cancer, either alone or in combination with conventional treatments.","title":"Tumor suppressive activity of a variant isoform of manganese superoxide dismutase released by a human liposarcoma cell line.","pubmedId":"16550599"}
