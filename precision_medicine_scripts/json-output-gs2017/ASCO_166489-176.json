It is constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm of various cell types. Null or decreased expression can be prognostic of tumor progression and a predictor of the likelihood to respond to targeted therapies. In this study, we describe the optimization and comparison of immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays developed using two PTEN antibodies: SP218 and 138G6. Methods: Fully automated immunohistochemical assays were optimized for PTEN using the Spring Bioscience (Spring, Pleasanton, CA) anti-PTEN (clone SP218) Rabbit mAb antibody and the Cell Signaling Technology (CST, Danvers, MA) anti-PTEN (clone 138G6) Rabbit mAb using instruments and detection chemistries from Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. (\"SP218 assay\" and 138G6 assay,\" respectively). Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) whole tissue specimens of prostate cancer were used for optimization of the SP218 and 138G6 assays. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing FFPE prostate cancer cases and breast cancer cases were used for the comparison staining. H-scores were used for cytoplasm and nuclear scoring. Results: Eighty prostate cancer, and eighty breast cancer TMA case cores, each stained with the SP218 and 138G6 assays were evaluated by three board certified pathologists in a blinded study. Analysis of these specimens showed that the SP218 assay performed equivalently to 138G6 assay, except was more sensitive in the low to null PTEN expression. Sensitivity was determined by a larger clustering of H-Scores from the SP218 assay in the lower intensity bins compared to the distribution of H-Scores from the 138G6 assay. Conclusions: Null or decreased PTEN expression is an important factor for determining the proper targeted therapy. Having a specific and accurate diagnostic test is critical for identifying patients who could benefit from these treatments. Due to its sensitivity in the low/null PTEN expression patient population, the SP218 assay has been deemed superior to the 138G6 assay.","title":"Quantitative and qualitative characterization of two PTEN clones: SP218 and 138G6.","pubmedId":"ASCO_166489-176"}
