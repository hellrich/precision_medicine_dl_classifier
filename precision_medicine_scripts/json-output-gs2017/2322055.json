Eleven patients with carcinoma of the high cervical esophagus were encountered over the past 7 years at our institution. There were 6 men and 5 women whose ages ranged from 51 to 72 years. Six patients had tracheal or laryngeal invasion. In all instances one-stage pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy with pharyngogastric (6 patients) or pharyngocolic (5 patients) reconstruction was performed. There was one hospital death. Six patients died 6 to 35 months postoperatively: 1 from recurrence, 2 from generalized metastases, and 3 with both local recurrent and metastatic disease. One other patient died free of disease 6 weeks postoperatively of pneumonia. The remaining 3 patients are alive 12 to 84 months after operation with excellent rehabilitation and good quality of life. We conclude that one-stage surgical resection and reconstruction for high cervical carcinoma of the esophagus offers good palliation and possible long-term survival with acceptable operative risk.","title":"Surgery for high cervical esophageal carcinoma: experience with 11 patients.","pubmedId":"2322055"}
