We assessed the correlation of the CA125 serum levels with the severity of congestive heart failure (CHF) and investigated their potential prognostic value in relation to major cardiovascular events.\nCA125 levels were measured in 95 male patients aged 70+/-10 years, admitted for decompensated CHF. The patients were divided into three groups, according to their New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. Group A contained 23 patients in NYHA IV, group B 34 patients in NYHA III, and group C 38 patients in NYHA I-II. The patients were also divided into two groups according to their CA125 value on admission. Group 1 included 45 patients with normal CA125 levels and group 2 50 patients with elevated CA125. All patients were followed for 15+/-8.5 months and the major cardiovascular events (death and re-hospitalizations due to CHF) were recorded.\nSerum levels of CA125 were higher in groups A and B than in group C (36.4 [19.8-82] U/ml and 34.6 [26-78] U/ml vs. 25.3 [9.1-29] U/ml, respectively, p\u003c0.05). No correlation was detected between CA125 levels and left ventricular ejection fraction. However, patients with pulmonary congestion and peripheral edemas had higher levels of CA125 (p\u003d0.002 and p\u003c0.03, respectively). Nineteen patients died during the follow-up period, but the mortality rate was not significantly different between groups 1 and 2 (p\u003d0.8). Nevertheless, the patients of group 1 reported fewer re-hospitalizations than patients of group 2 (p\u003d0.003). The relative risk (RR) for re-hospitalization was calculated to be RR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.215-0.76 (p\u003c0.005), in patients with elevated levels of CA125. Cox regression analysis revealed that CA125 had independent prognostic value (OR: 1.007 [95% CI: 1.004-1.010], p\u003c0.0001) for re-hospitalizations.\nSerum levels of CA125 are associated with the severity of CHF and are also independent predictive markers for re-hospitalizations. We therefore conclude that CA125 can be used as a prognostic marker of disease severity and increased morbidity in patients with decompensated CHF.","title":"Clinical and prognostic value of elevated CA125 levels in patients with congestive heart failure.","pubmedId":"17134062"}
