Irinotecan was recently approved for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer refractory to 5-fluorouracil. It has also been evaluated in chemotherapy-na√Øve patients both alone and in combination with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin or with oxaliplatin. Evaluated primarily in patients with colorectal cancer, oxaliplatin, a novel platinum compound, is an active agent. In combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, oxaliplatin provides a higher response rate than 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin alone. Furthermore, when oxaliplatin was added to the same 5-fluorouracil-based regimen in which patients had disease progression, clinical activity was observed. Other agents discussed herein are raltitrexed and the oral fluorinated pyrimidines, including uracil:tegafur plus leucovorin, capecitabine, eniluracil plus oral 5-fluorouracil, and S-1. Gemcitabine has been demonstrated to be more effective than 5-fluorouracil in the alleviation of disease-specific symptoms in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine also confers a modest survival advantage. Combinations of these novel compounds are evaluated in gastrointestinal malignancies in the advanced disease setting and in adjuvant therapy programs.","title":"Novel chemotherapeutic agents for gastrointestinal cancers.","pubmedId":"10416883"}
