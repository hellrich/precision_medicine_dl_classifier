A total of 19 patients who had bulky cervical cancer of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage Ib2 to IIb2 (lesion diameter \u003e4 cm) received NAC with paclitaxel combined with carboplatin and cisplatin prior to laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. The tumor diameter, the response rate, the resection rate and the lymph node metastasis rate after chemotherapy, as well as the toxicity were evaluated. All patients successfully received NAC, with the exception of 1 patient with FIGO Stage Ib2 and 7 cm tumor diameter, who rejected complete therapy. The tumor diameter was reduced from 4.93±0.81cm before NAC to 2.57±1.90 cm after treatment (P\u003c0.01), and the overall response rate [complete remission (CR) + partial remission (PR)] was 78.9% (15/19). Two patients received radiotherapy after NAC, 1 patient was found to have cystic metastasis during the surgery and the operative rate was 83.3% (15/18). Pelvic lymph node metastasis was found in 2 of the 18 patients (11.1%) without parametrial and vaginal margin involvement. Hematological toxicity was the most common side effect and the 3-4 toxicity level was only 11.1% (2/18). In conclusion, NAC with paclitaxel, combined with carboplatin and cisplatin, followed by laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy was found to be effective and safe. Thus, NAC is the ideal treatment for patients with early bulky cervical cancer.","title":"Treatment of early bulky cervical cancer with neoadjuvant paclitaxel, carboplatin and cisplatin prior to laparoscopical radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.","pubmedId":"22740967"}
