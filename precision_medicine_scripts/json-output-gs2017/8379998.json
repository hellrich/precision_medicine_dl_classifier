To identify the genetic defect, the region between two flanking polymorphic markers on chromosome 22 was cloned and several genes identified. One is the site of germ-line mutations in NF2 patients and of somatic mutations in NF2-related tumours. Its deduced product has homology with proteins at the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton interface, a previously unknown site of action of tumour suppressor genes in humans.","title":"Alteration in a new gene encoding a putative membrane-organizing protein causes neuro-fibromatosis type 2.","pubmedId":"8379998"}
