PTEN expression and PIK3CA mutation were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and pyrosequencing.\nForty-eight patients received trastuzumab (n \u003d 39) or lapatinib (n \u003d 9) combination chemotherapy. PTEN loss was found in 47.9% (n \u003d 23), but no PIK3CA mutations were identified. Twenty-six (54.1%) patients responded to HER2-based therapy, without a significant difference between patients with PTEN loss and those without (52.2 vs. 56.0%). Among the patients with responsive disease, time to best response did not differ by PTEN status, but the duration of response was significantly shorter for patients with PTEN loss (median 4.2 vs. 6.1 months, p \u003d 0.04). In addition, patients with PTEN loss had a significantly shorter progression-free survival time (median 4.9 vs. 7.3 months, p \u003d 0.047).\nPTEN deficiency is an important predictive marker for early resistance to HER2 inhibitor treatment in gastric cancer patients. This finding may be useful for the development of drug combinations and identification of patients who need a modified treatment strategy.","title":"PTEN deficiency as a predictive biomarker of resistance to HER2-targeted therapy in advanced gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"25300346"}
