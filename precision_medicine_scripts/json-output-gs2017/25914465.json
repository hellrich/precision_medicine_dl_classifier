In vivo, we detected the basal expression level of miR-19a using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and the relevance between expression of miR-19a and clinicopathological information was analyzed. In vitro, miR-19a was ectopically expressed using overexpression and knock-down strategies.\nOverexpression of miR-19a was significantly associated with metastasis of GC and inferior overall prognosis. However, no significant correlation was found between miR-19a expression and other characteristics such as age, gender, tobacco, alcohol or tumor size. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays showed that overexpression of miR-19a promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion, and that overexpression of miR-19a promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition through activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. Blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway could cancel the effect of miR-19a.\nAll together, our results suggest that miR-19a could be used as a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of GC.","title":"MiR-19a promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition through PI3K/AKT pathway in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"25914465"}
