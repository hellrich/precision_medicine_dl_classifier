In this study, we investigated the functional and therapeutic relevance of cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11) as a putative target in liposarcoma. CDK11 knockdown by synthetic siRNA or lentiviral shRNA decreased cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in liposarcoma cells. Moreover, CDK11 knockdown enhances the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin to inhibit cell growth in liposarcoma cells. These findings suggest that CDK11 is critical for the growth and proliferation of liposarcoma cells. CDK11 may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of liposarcoma patients.
