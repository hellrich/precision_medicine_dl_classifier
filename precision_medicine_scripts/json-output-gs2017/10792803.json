Liposarcomas are extremely rare at this age compared to benign lipoblastomas, which are the most frequent tumors of fatty tissue in childhood. The prognosis of myxoid liposarcoma is good, especially when, as in this patient, the tumor is located in the subcutis where a large and deep excision is possible and often curative.","title":"Myxoid liposarcoma in a 12-year-old girl.","pubmedId":"10792803"}
