They could be of significant size at presentation, which has been associated with difficult surgical excision, high recurrence rate, and possibly aggressive clinical behavior. Monosomy 22 is a common molecular event in this neoplasm. Additionally, losses on chromosomes 1,7,10, and 14 have been identified in clinically aggressive meningiomas. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization, we studied a group of pediatric meningiomas, including neurofibromatosis type II-associated, sporadic, and radiation-induced cases. We found NF2 gene deletion in about 72% of the cases, with corresponding absent or minimal merlin protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Our findings confirm that the NF2 gene plays a role in the tumorigenesis of pediatric meningiomas and that chromogenic in situ hybridization is an efficient, economic, and reliable method for routinely assessing NF2 gene deletion in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.","title":"Evaluation of NF2 gene deletion in pediatric meningiomas using chromogenic in situ hybridization.","pubmedId":"17478763"}
