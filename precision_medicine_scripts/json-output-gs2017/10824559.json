Future therapeutic strategies for lung cancer should include the use of spiral CT, which can detect lung tumors with \u003c 2 cm in diameter, in group health screening for the early diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, and the use of recently new developed anticancer for the treatment of inoperable cases of adenocarcinoma. Compared to the classical combined chemotherapy, future therapeutic modalities should be more effective for improving prognosis and quality of life of lung cancer patients.","title":"[Adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"10824559"}
