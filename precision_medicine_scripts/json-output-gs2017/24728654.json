Several risk factors increase the risk of developing PC. Therapeutic strategies used are dictated by the extent of disease. Supportive treatment is critical because of the high frequency of symptoms. For localized disease, surgery followed by adjuvant gemcitabine is the standard. Neoadjuvant and new adjuvant chemotherapy regimens are being evaluated. Locally advanced disease should respond best guided by a multidisciplinary team. Various treatment options are appropriate such as chemotherapy alone or chemoradiotherapy with integration of rescue surgery if the tumor becomes resectable. In metastatic disease, chemotherapy should be reserved for patients with ECOG 0-1 using Folfirinox or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as the most recommended options. Several therapeutic strategies targeting unregulated pathways are under evaluation with an unmet need for biomarkers to guide management.
