However, side effects such as cold-triggered dysesthesia and laryngo-pharyngeal spasm have been reported. To clarify the side effects of oxaliplatin in a subarctic or arctic setting, a phase II study was performed. In October and November 1999, 8 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled and treated with oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 - day 1) and the FLv - Nordic regimen (5-FU 500 mg/m2 and leucovorin 100 mg for 2 days) every 3rd week as second- (6 pts) or third-line (2 pts) therapy. At evaluation in March 2000, 7 patients were alive and 6 PD, 1 SD and 1 PR were obtained. Acute laryngeal reaction was reported by 3 out of 8 patients and cold-triggered dysesthesia by all patients. Six available patients were interviewed by phone. Half of the interviewed patients recommend the therapy to be offered to other patients. In conclusion, oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) therapy in arctic or subarctic areas during the winter introduces significant cold-triggered symptoms.","title":"Oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer patients living in an arctic or subarctic area: significant cold-triggered dysesthesias and laryngeal reactions.","pubmedId":"11154038"}
