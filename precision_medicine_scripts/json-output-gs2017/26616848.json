In univariate analysis, RR was significantly higher for mEGFR compared with wild-type EGFR/KRAS (odds ratio [OR]: 4.96; p \u003d 0.05) or mKRAS (OR: 1.81; p \u003d 0.03). In multivariate analysis, KRAS G12V or G12C status was associated with both poor RR (OR: 0.1; p \u003c 0.0001) and overall survival (OR: 3.41; p \u003c 0.0001).\nmEGFR are associated with higher RR to brain RT than wild-type EGFR/RAS or mKRAS.","title":"Impact of EGFR mutations and KRAS amino acid substitution on the response to radiotherapy for brain metastasis of non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26616848"}
