Here we report a cross-sectional study using a validated human papillomavirus genotyping method to reveal the human papillomavirus prevalence and genotype distribution in Japanese women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2/3 and invasive cervical cancer.\nCervical exfoliated cells were collected from 647 patients with abnormal cervical histology (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2, n \u003d 164; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3, n \u003d 334; and invasive cervical cancer, n \u003d 149), and subjected to the PGMY-PCR-based genotyping assay. The association between human papillomavirus infection and lesion severity was calculated using a prevalence ratio.\nOverall, the prevalence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was 96.3% in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2, 98.8% in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 and 88.0% in invasive cervical cancer (97.8% in squamous cell carcinoma and 71.4% in adenocarcinoma). The three most prevalent types were as follows: human papillomavirus 16 (29.3%), human papillomavirus 52 (27.4%) and human papillomavirus 58 (22.0%) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2; human papillomavirus 16 (44.9%), human papillomavirus 52 (26.0%) and human papillomavirus 58 (17.4%) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3; and human papillomavirus 16 (47.7%), human papillomavirus 18 (23.5%) and human papillomavirus 52 (8.7%) in invasive cervical cancer. The prevalence ratio of human papillomavirus 16 was significantly higher in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 compared with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2 (prevalence ratio, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.13) and in squamous cell carcinoma compared with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 (prevalence ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.87). Multiple infections decreased from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2/3 (38.4/29.6%) to invasive cervical cancer (14.1%), whereas co-infections with human papillomavirus 16/52/58 were found in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2/3.\nThe results of this study provide pre-vaccination era baseline data on human papillomavirus type distribution in Japanese women and serve as a reliable basis for monitoring the future impact of human papillomavirus vaccination in Japan.","title":"Human papillomavirus genotype distribution in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 and invasive cervical cancer in Japanese women.","pubmedId":"25156680"}
