Rearrangements of NTRK1 are frequently detected in human papillary thyroid carcinoma and lead to the formation of chimeric oncogenes, similarly to what observed for the other neurotrophin receptor RET. In addition, the two receptor genes are target of point mutations associated with different human diseases. RET is affected by germ line and somatic mutations in MEN2A, MEN2B tumor syndromes and in the abnormal developmental Hirschsprung disease, whereas mutations of NTRK1 have been reported very recently in patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anidrosis (CIPA). With the aim to provide a tool for searching mutations along the whole NTRK1 gene, we have determined its genomic organization. Our results demonstrated that NTRK1 is contained within 25 Kb of DNA and is organized in 17 exons, one of which is alternatively spliced. The sequence of the 5\u0027 flanking region indicates a high content in C/G, the absence of TATA box, the presence of several putative binding sites for Sp1, AP1, AP2, AP3, ATF and GCF transcription factors.","title":"Genomic organization of the human NTRK1 gene.","pubmedId":"8957089"}
