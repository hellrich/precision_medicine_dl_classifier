Advanced GIST is treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib. Acquired resistance to TKI is mainly caused by secondary KIT mutations, but can also be attributed to a switch of KIT dependency to another receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). We tested the efficacy of cabozantinib, a novel TKI targeting KIT, MET, AXL, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of GIST, carrying different KIT mutations. NMRI nu/nu mice (n \u003d 52) were bilaterally transplanted with human GIST: UZLX-GIST4 (KIT exon 11 mutation, imatinib sensitive), UZLX-GIST2 (KIT exon 9, imatinib dose-dependent resistance), or UZLX-GIST9 (KIT exon 11 and 17 mutations, imatinib resistant). Mice were grouped as control (untreated), imatinib (50 mg/kg/bid), and cabozantinib (30 mg/kg/qd) and treated orally for 15 days. Cabozantinib resulted in significant tumor regression in UZLX-GIST4 and -GIST2 and delayed tumor growth in -GIST9. In all three models, cabozantinib inhibited the proliferative activity, which was completely absent in UZLX-GIST4 and significantly reduced in -GIST2 and -GIST9. Increased apoptotic activity was observed only in UZLX-GIST4. Cabozantinib inhibited the KIT signaling pathway in UZLX-GIST4 and -GIST2. In addition, compared with both control and imatinib, cabozantinib significantly reduced microvessel density in all models. In conclusion, cabozantinib showed antitumor activity in GIST PDX models through inhibition of tumor growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis, in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant models.
