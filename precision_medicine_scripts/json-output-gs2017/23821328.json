Eligible patients received weekly intravenous CarboRT with carboplatin 100 mg/m2, and a comparison was made with a historical patient group that received weekly CisRT with cisplatin 40 mg/m2.\nMedian follow-up was 36 months (range: 4-66 months) in the CarboRT group and 53 months (range: 4-121 months) in the CisRT group. Compared with the historical CisRT group, the CarboRT group showed no statistically significant differences in recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-2.81) and survival (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 0.49-6.54). The mean numbers of received cycles of CarboRT and CisRT were 7.5 ± 1.4 and 6.0 ± 1.8, respectively (p \u003c .001). The rates of grade 3-4 toxicity were similar in the two groups.\nCarboRT was better tolerated than CisRT without compromising tumor response and survival in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer and poor general condition.","title":"Comparison of carboplatin- and cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer patients with morbidity risks.","pubmedId":"23821328"}
