The main role of BRCA2 appears to involve regulating the function of RAD51 in the repair by homologous recombination. BRCA1 has a broader role upstream of BRCA2, participating in various cellular processes in response to DNA damage. The DNA repair defect associated with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 could be exploited to develop new targeted therapeutic approaches for cancer occurring in mutation carriers.","title":"The roles of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and associated proteins in the maintenance of genomic stability.","pubmedId":"16998501"}
