This study was designed to determine the expression of this lung cancer drug resistance-related gene (LCDRG) in lung cancer tissues, juxtacancerous tissues, and five lung cancer cell strains.\nThe expression of LCDRG was determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method in 38 lung cancer tissues,12 juxtacancerous tissues, and 5 lung cancer cell strains.\nThe expression of LCDRG in cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in juxtacancerous tissue (P\u003c 0.001). There was no significance of the expression among adenocarcinoma, brochioloalveolar carcinoma, and squamous carcinoma. In lung cancer cell strains, the expression levels of LCDRG in adenocarcinoma cell strains SPC-A-1 and A549, big cell lung cancer cell strain H460, small cell lung cancer cell strains H446 and SH77 were decreased gradually.\nLCDRG is closely related to lung cancer and may be involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.","title":"[Expression of a new lung cancer drug resistance-related gene in lung cancer tissues and lung cancer cell strains].","pubmedId":"12600294"}
