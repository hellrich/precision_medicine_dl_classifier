The incidence of non-diagnostic results, inconclusive results, diagnostic surgery, and diagnostic performance of repeated FNA and CNB were assessed, and factors affecting second non-diagnostic results were evaluated.\nCNB achieved a significantly lower non-diagnostic and inconclusive rate than repeated FNA (1.1 % versus 40.0 %, P \u003c 0.001; 7.2 % versus 72.0 %, P \u003c 0.001). All diagnostic performances with CNB were higher than repeated FNA. The diagnostic surgery rate was lower with CNB than with repeated FNA (3.6 % versus 16.7 %, P \u003d 0.047). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that repeated FNA was the most important factor for second non-diagnostic results (OR \u003d 56.06, P \u003c 0.001), followed by nodules with rim calcification (OR \u003d 7.46, P \u003d 0.003).\nCNB is more useful than repeated FNA for reducing the number of non-diagnostic and inconclusive results and for preventing unnecessary diagnostic surgery for thyroid nodules with initially non-diagnostic FNA results.\n• Core-needle biopsy achieved a lower number of non-diagnostic and inconclusive results. • Core-needle biopsy achieved better diagnostic performance. • Use of core-needle biopsy could prevent unnecessary diagnostic surgery. • Repeated fine-needle aspiration was significantly associated with a second non-diagnosis.","title":"Thyroid nodules with initially non-diagnostic, fine-needle aspiration results: comparison of core-needle biopsy and repeated fine-needle aspiration.","pubmedId":"25038860"}
