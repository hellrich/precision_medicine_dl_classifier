MET is frequently overexpressed or amplified in a range of malignancies. Therefore, MET is an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of cancer. BAY-853474 is a novel specific MET inhibitor highly effective in preclinical tumor models.\nFor response monitoring in clinical studies, soluble plasma biomarkers are the most convenient and least invasive choice. Therefore, we sought to identify such biomarkers in xenograft models.\nWe show that BAY-853474 reduces the tumor burden in U87MG glioblastoma, NCI-H1993 nonsmall cell lung cancer, and HS746T gastric cancer xenograft models. We demonstrate that the dose dependence is reflected by inhibition of MET phosphorylation and that the soluble plasma biomarkers hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-8 as well as the MET-ectodomain can be used to monitor the tumor size and response to treatment. Clinical samples, however, show only moderately elevated levels of these biomarker candidates in cancer patients even with MET amplification. We, therefore, established an immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol to detect MET phosphorylation that is suitable to monitor the effect of BAY-853474 in tumor biopsies.\nIHC-based analysis of target phosphorylation in tumor biopsies is recommended in addition to testing plasma biomarkers for response monitoring.","title":"Preclinical evaluation of biomarkers for response monitoring to the MET inhibitor BAY-853474.","pubmedId":"22452362"}
