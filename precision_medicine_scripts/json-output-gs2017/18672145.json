In 20% to 40% of such melanoma families, germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene have been identified. Apart from a high risk of melanoma, a proportion of kindreds that have familial melanoma also have an increased risk of pancreatic carcinoma. Guidelines for management of familial melanoma and the issue of genetic testing for CDKN2A germline mutations are discussed.","title":"Familial melanoma.","pubmedId":"18672145"}
