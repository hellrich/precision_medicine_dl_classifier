The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes after resection of occupational cholangiocarcinoma to establish a treatment strategy for this disease.\nClinicopathological findings and outcomes after surgical intervention in 20 patients with occupational cholangiocarcinoma were investigated.\nOf 20 the patients, curative resection was performed in 16 patients. Three patients underwent radiation at the stump of the bile ducts. Adjuvant chemotherapy was performed in 12 patients. Biliary intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct, and/or chronic bile duct injury was detected in most subjects. Intraabdominal infection developed after surgery in nine patients. Cholangiocarcinoma recurred in 12 of the 20 patients. The recurrent tumors in five patients developed at a different part of the bile duct from the primary tumor and a second resection was performed in four of these five patients.\nThe incidence of postoperative complications including intraabdominal infection was high in patients with occupational cholangiocarcinoma. Multicentric recurrence occurred not infrequently after surgery because the bile ducts had a high potential for the development of carcinoma. The aggressive treatment including second resection for the multicentric recurrence appeared to be effective.","title":"Outcomes after resection of occupational cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27363864"}
