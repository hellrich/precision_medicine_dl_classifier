Among the most significant treatment advancement in recent years are the introduction of target therapies of EGFR-TKIs (Erlotinib and Gefitinib) for adenocarcinoma with EGFR activating mutations, and Crizotinib for NSCLC with ALK activation (EML4-ALK fusion)1. ALK activation are associated with a subset of NSCLC patients (35%).Crizotinib is considered not a particularly potent ALK inhibitor, with IC50 at range of tens of nanomoles. It may not be an ideal agent for treating NSCLC with activating ALK. Therefore, a new ALK inhibitor with better potency and specificity could be of particularly medical importance. Currently, the industry is actively searching for such new agents. A relevant experimental model could also greatly facilitate evaluating and validating these new drug candidates.Patient derived xenografts (PDX) (including NSCLC PDX) mirror patients histopathology and genetic profiles2, thus known as patient avatar. It has improved predictive power as preclinical cancer models, and enables discovery of predictive biomarkers for targeted therapeutics. We have established a large collection of NSCLC PDX models (NSCLC-HuPrime) by engrafting nave patient tumor tissues into immune-compromised mice2.Among these models, we have identified one model, LU1656, of NSCL carcinosarcoma histology and with EML4-ALK fusion mutation. This mutation apparently causes over-expression of ALK as measured at mRNA level. This model has wild-type KRAS, c-MET and EGFR genes. Treatment of LU1656 with Crizotinib caused significant but not complete tumor response, suggesting ALK activation is one of the oncogenic drivers of this model. In addition, LU1656 also responded to Cetuximab, but respond poorly to Erlotinib. It would be interesting to examine the combination of these treatments. This model is, to our knowledge, the first reported PDX model with EML4-ALK fusion mutation. We believe that LU1656 would be a useful model to evaluate investigational ALK inhibitors, and new combination treatment regimens of Crizotinib and standard of care chemotherapies.","title":"A NSCLC PDX with EML4-ALK fusion mutation responds to crizotinib.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-337"}
