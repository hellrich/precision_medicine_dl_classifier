Eight families (8%) were found to carry five different mutations, all of which are predicted to prematurely truncate the protein product. These BRCA2 families have early-onset breast cancer (mean and median age \u003d 49 years), with four of the eight families including ovarian cancer but with no families including male breast cancer. A wide spectrum of other cancers also is seen in these families. Three mutations were identified in more than one family, and haplotype analysis in the families suggested a common founder for each recurrent mutation. One recurrent mutation, 999del5, previously has been noted as a common mutation in Iceland. The relationship between the Icelandic 999del5 mutation and the Finnish 999del5 mutation was explored by comparison of families from both countries. A common haplotype covering a minimal region intragenic to the BRCA2 gene was shared between the Icelandic and the Finnish mutation carriers.","title":"A low proportion of BRCA2 mutations in Finnish breast cancer families.","pubmedId":"9150152"}
