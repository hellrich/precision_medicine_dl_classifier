Cytologic specimens were obtained by fine needle aspiration (ENA) and imprint smears from resected pancreases.\nIn the 12 IDAP cases, roughly 2 cell populations, SD/CIS-type cells and invasive component-type cells, were detected cytologically. The former composed a small portion of the tumor cells, exhibited a small nuclei without anisonucleosis and had a decreased total quantity of chromatin as compared with invasive component-type cells. SD/CIS-type cells were found in small papillary-cohesive and compactly packed clusters and had clearly defined cytoplasmic borders, a nucleus individually enveloped in well-preserved cytoplasm and small amount of cytoplasm (\u003c 15 microm in short diameter) without prominent anisocytosis. The latter comprised mostly of the tumor cells, were present characteristically as a loose and discohesive population and contained a combination of hyperchromatin, large nuclei (\u003e 15 microm) and abundant cytoplasm (\u003e21 microm). Histologically, these 12 cases exhibited IDAP with SD/CIS. Hence, the invasive component-type cells appeared to originate with ordinary invasive spread of IDAP, and the SD/CIS type cells appeared to originate with noninvasive intraductal spread.\nTwo cytologic patterns originating with SD/CIS and invasive components of IDAP could be differentiated.","title":"Two cytologic patterns in invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"16450900"}
