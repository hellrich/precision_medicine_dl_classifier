Our previous study has found that transfection of wild type nm23-H1 gene can significantly downregulate the ERK1/2 activity of human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line L9981. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of nm23-H1 and exogenous ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor U0126 on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) of human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line L9981 and its malignant biological behaviors.\nThe expressive levels of total-ERK1/2, dually phosphorylated ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 relative activity of the human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell lines, L9981 (parent cell line with nm23-H1 gene hetero-deletion), L9981-nm23-H1 (transfected with nm23-H1 gene ) and L9981-PLXSN (transfected with vector) were detected by Western blot and immunoprecipitation technique after treating with U0126 (40Î¼mol/L for 20 minutes). The in vitro proliferative and invasive abilities among the above three lung cancer cell lines were determined by MTT and improved Boyden chamber methods.\nThe phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression level and relative activity in L9981-nm23-H1 lung cancer cell line were remarkably lower than those in L9981 and L9981-PLXSN lung cancer cell lines after being treated with U0126 (P \u003c 0.01), but there was no significant difference between L9981 and L9981-PLXSN lung cancer cell lines. No significant difference of total ERK1/2 expression level was observed among the three lung cancer cell lines (P \u003e 0.05) after being treated with U0126. The in vitro proliferation and invasion of L9981-nm-23H1 lung cancer cell line were remarkably lower than those of L9981 and L9981-PLXSN lung cancer cell lines (P \u003c 0.01 ), but no significant difference was found between L9981 and L9981-PLXSN lung cancer cell lines (P \u003e 0.05 ); U0126 could significantly down-regulate the in vitro proliferation and invasion of L9981 lung cancer cell line (P \u003c 0.01).\nBlocking the activity of ERK1/2 in L9981 lung cancer cell line and transfecting the nm23-H1 gene into the L9981 lung cancer cell line may produce similar cell biological behavior changes, namely the significant reduction of in vitro proliferation and invasion of L9981 lung cancer cell line. These results indicate that the molecular mechanism which nm23-H1 gene reverses invasion and proliferation of the human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line may be related to its effects of down-regulating the activity of the key kinase ERK1/2 of Ras-to-MAPK signal transduction pathway.","title":"[Experimental study on molecular mechanism of nm23-H1 gene transfection reversing the malignant phenotype of human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line].","pubmedId":"21176443"}
