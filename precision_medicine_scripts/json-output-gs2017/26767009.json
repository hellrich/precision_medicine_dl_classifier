However, the clinicopathological features of patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene have not been defined completely.\nClinicopathological data of 200 Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC were analyzed retrospectively to explore their possible correlations with EML4-ALK fusions.\nThe EML4-ALK fusion gene was detected in 56 (28.0%) of the 200 NSCLC patients, and undetected in 22 (11.0%) patients because of an insufficient amount of pathological tissue. The median age of the patients with positive and negative EML4-ALK was 48 and 55 years, respectively. Patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene were significantly younger (P\u003c 0.001). The detection rate of the EML4-ALK fusion gene in patients who received primary tumor or metastatic lymph node resection was significantly higher than in patients who received fine-needle biopsy (P\u003d 0.003). The detection rate of the EML4-ALK fusion gene in patients with a time lag from obtainment of the pathological tissue to EML4-ALK fusion gene detection ≤48 months was significantly higher than in patients \u003e48 months (P\u003d 0.020). The occurrence of the EML4-ALK fusion gene in patients with wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was significantly higher than in patients with mutant-type EGFR (42.5% [37/87] vs. 6.3% [1/16], P\u003d 0.005).\nYounger age and wild-type EGFR were identified as clinicopathological characteristics of patients with advanced NSCLC who harbored the EML4-ALK fusion gene. The optimal time lag from the obtainment of the pathological tissue to the time of EML4-ALK fusion gene detection is ≤48 months.","title":"Analysis of clinicopathological features of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like-4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion gene in Chinese patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26767009"}
