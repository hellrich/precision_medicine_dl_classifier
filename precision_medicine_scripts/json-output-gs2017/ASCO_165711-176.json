BRAF V600E mutations have also been identified in some rare cancers, including anaplastic thyroid cancer, biliary tract cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, nonseminomatous germ cell tumor, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), World Health Organization (WHO) grade I/II glioma, WHO grade III/IV glioma, multiple myeloma, and adenocarcinoma of the small intestine. US incidence rates of these rare tumors range from 0.07 to 6.3 per 100,000, with BRAF V600E mutation frequency ranging from 3% in high-grade glioma to 90% in HCL. Therefore, the ROAR study is underway in pts with these 9 rare BRAF-mutant cancers to assess the safety and efficacy of D + T combination therapy. Methods: This international, multicenter, open-label phase 2 study (NCT02034110) uses a Bayesian hierarchical statistical design that increases study power by borrowing information across histology cohorts based on the emerging response rate. Enrollment for each of the 9 cohorts (up to 25 pts each) may be stopped early for futility or efficacy if various criteria occur based on accrued data. Pts with BRAF V600Emutant histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced disease with no available standard treatment options are eligible. Enrollment based on local BRAF V600E mutation results is permitted. Pts receive D (150 mg twice daily orally) and T (2 mg once daily orally) on a continuous dosing schedule until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death occurs. Responses are assessed every 8 weeks per tumor-specific response criteria while pts are on study treatment. The primary study endpoint is overall response rate by investigator assessment. Secondary objectives include duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Pharmacodynamic markers and quality of life will also be evaluated. If a histological cohort meets stopping criteria for early efficacy, an expansion cohort will be opened. This ongoing trial is currently recruiting pts at 48 centers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and South Korea.
