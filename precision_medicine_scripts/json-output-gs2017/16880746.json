In addition to transcriptional regulation, CtIP plays an important role in the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint control. Recent evidence points to a viral factor-like S phase promoting activity of CtIP in counteracting Rb repression to facilitate E2F-directed transactivation during the G(1)/S transition. Genetic studies in mice revealed the haploid insufficiency of CtIP in suppressing tumorigenesis associated with shortened life span. Thus, CtIP emerges as a multivalent adaptor that connects cell cycle checkpoint control, transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression.","title":"CtIP, a multivalent adaptor connecting transcriptional regulation, checkpoint control and tumor suppression.","pubmedId":"16880746"}
