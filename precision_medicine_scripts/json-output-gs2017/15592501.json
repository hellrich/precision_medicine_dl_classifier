The BALB/c strain (resistant allele) carried the Arg allele, whereas the SWR/J mouse strain (Par4-susceptible allele) carried the Cys variation, recently proven to functionally modulate tumorigenesis. Seven genetic linkage crosses herein analysed and six crosses reported in the literature pointed to the candidacy of the Met gene for Par4. Analysis of genomic DNA of 126 lung adenocarcinoma patients for the Met juxtamembrane domain revealed the same Arg/Cys variation at the mouse homologous position in one patient; two other patients carried additional variants in the same domain, suggesting a potential role for rare MET juxtamembrane variants in human lung cancer.","title":"Met proto-oncogene juxtamembrane rare variations in mouse and humans: differential effects of Arg and Cys alleles on mouse lung tumorigenesis.","pubmedId":"15592501"}
