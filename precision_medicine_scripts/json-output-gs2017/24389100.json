Transcriptome analysis revealed that G1 release through cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and CDK4 primes and cooperates with the cytokine-driven gene response. CDK6 physically and functionally interacts with the NF-κB subunit p65 in the nucleus and is found at promoters of many transcriptionally active NF-κB target genes. CDK6 recruitment to distinct chromatin regions of inflammatory genes was essential for proper loading of p65 to its cognate binding sites and for the function of p65 coactivators, such as TRIP6. Furthermore, cytokine-inducible nuclear translocation and chromatin association of CDK6 depends on the kinase activity of TAK1 and p38. These results have widespread biological implications, as aberrant CDK6 expression or activation that is frequently observed in human tumors modulates NF-κB to shape the cytokine and chemokine repertoires in chronic inflammation and cancer.
