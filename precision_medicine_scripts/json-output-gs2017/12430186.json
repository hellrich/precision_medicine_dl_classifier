To assess its role in gastric cancers, we investigated MBD4/MED1 mutations in sporadic gastric cancers, compared with colon cancers. Frameshift mutations were found in 29% of gastric and 20% of colon MSI-H cancers, but not in any low-frequency microsatellite instability/microsatellite stable cancers. MBD4/MED1 is mutated in gastric cancers as frequently as in colon cancers; these mutations reduce the accuracy of DNA repair, and may lead to cancer progression.","title":"Frameshift mutations in the MBD4/MED1 gene in primary gastric cancer with high-frequency microsatellite instability.","pubmedId":"12430186"}
