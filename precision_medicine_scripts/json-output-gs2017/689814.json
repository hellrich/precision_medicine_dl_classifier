The carcinoma was fused with the liposarcoma as a result of its invasive local growth and had formed deposits in the lymph nodes, bones and lungs. The left seminal vesicle showed localized amyloidosis. A review of the published cases of mesenchymal tumours of the seminal vesicles is presented.","title":"A hitherto undescribed case of \"collision\" tumour: liposarcoma of the seminal vesicle and prostatic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"689814"}
