GISTs originate from cells of Cajal and related stem cells. Surgery and imatinib therapy are the main lines of treatment.\nWe report on a case with GIST in the colon treated with surgical resection followed by adjuvant imatinib therapy. This treatment showed no side-effects, and subsequent colonoscopy was unremarkable.\nThe diagnosis was delayed for 12 months after initial presentation of vague abdominal pain, thus highlighting the need to improve clinical suspicion in order to detect GISTs in earlier stages when resection may be curative. Colonic GIST, in particular, may mimic presentation similar to ovarian cyst, as seen in the present case. This case report corroborates that patients with high-grade GISTs can be effectively treated with imatinib therapy. However, duration of treatment may vary depending on the grade of the tumor and side-effects.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor of colon: a case report and review of literature.","pubmedId":"24778074"}
