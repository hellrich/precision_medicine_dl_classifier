MUC1-positive and MUC2-negative expressions were significantly associated with lymphatic invasion, pancreatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced UICC stage. The KRAS mutation was significantly associated with large tumor size and pancreatic invasion. There were 35 intestinal (50%), 15 pancreatobiliary (22%), and 11 mixed subtype (16%) tumors. Patients with the mixed subtype showed significantly poor outcome. The invasiveness of the mixed subtype was similar to that of the pancreatobiliary subtype; moreover, the mixed subtype showed a high incidence of abnormal β-catenin immunolabeling (73%).\nProtein expression and genetic mutation are clinically associated with the characteristics of ampullary adenocarcinoma. The mixed subtype may have a distinct tumor nature as compared to other two major subtypes. J. Surg.
