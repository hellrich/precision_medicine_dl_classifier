PLE developed before the onset of LE in 61% of cases (median interval 12 years, range 1--40), concomitantly in 24%, and subsequently in a further 15% (median interval 3.5 years, range 1--25). To delineate the relationship between PLE and LE further, the prevalence of PLE was determined in 103 otherwise unaffected first-degree relatives of SCLE and DLE probands; we had previously demonstrated clustering of PLE in families, reflecting a strong genetic component. We found a significantly higher PLE prevalence in relatives of the LE probands than in the general population (P \u003c 0.001), giving an RR for PLE of 2.29 (95% CI 1.55--3.03) and 2.61 (95% CI 1.32--3.89) for female and male relatives, respectively.\nThe high prevalence of PLE in LE patients, together with clustering of PLE among first-degree relatives of SCLE and DLE probands, suggests that there may be a shared pathogenetic basis for PLE and cutaneous LE. We propose that predisposition to PLE may contribute to the LE phenotype in otherwise susceptible individuals.","title":"Familial clustering of polymorphic light eruption in relatives of patients with lupus erythematosus: evidence of a shared pathogenesis.","pubmedId":"11251568"}
