This study was designed to investigate the common variants of PALB2 and their association with breast cancer risk.\nFour single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; rs249954, rs249935, rs120963, and rs16940342) which tagged all 19 of the reported SNPs (minor allele frequency \u003e0.05) covering PALB2 were selected and genotyped in 1,049 patients with breast cancer and 1,073 cancer-free controls in a female Chinese population.\nBased on the multiple hypothesis testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method, tagging SNPs (tSNP) rs249954, rs120963, and rs16940342 were found to be associated with an increase of breast cancer risk (false discovery rate-adjusted P values of 0.004, 0.028, and 0.049, respectively) under the dominant model. tSNP rs249954 was associated with a 36% increase of breast cancer risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.36; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.13-1.64; P \u003d 0.001; TT/TC versus CC genotypes]. The adjusted OR for rs120963 was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.04-1.49; P \u003d 0.014; CC/CT versus TT genotypes). For rs16940342, the adjusted OR was 1.21 (95% CI, 1.02-1.45; P \u003d 0.037; GG/GA versus AA genotypes). Based on an additive model, tSNPs rs249954 and rs120963 were associated with an increase of breast cancer risk (P \u003d 0.005 and 0.019; respectively), with the false discovery rate-adjusted P values being 0.020 and 0.038, respectively.\nOur data suggest that the variants of PALB2 confer low-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population.","title":"Association of common PALB2 polymorphisms with breast cancer risk: a case-control study.","pubmedId":"18794107"}
