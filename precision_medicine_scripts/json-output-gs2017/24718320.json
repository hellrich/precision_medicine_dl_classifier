Recent developments in establishing mouse models that closely resemble human lung cancers involve the application of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for use in drug efficacy studies or to guide patient therapy. Here, we review recent applications of GEMMs in non-small cell lung cancer research for drug development and their potential in aiding biomarker discovery and understanding of biological mechanisms behind clinical outcomes and drug interactions.
