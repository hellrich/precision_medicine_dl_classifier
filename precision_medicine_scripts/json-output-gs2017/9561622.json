The amplification of HER-2/neu oncogene in the DNA of paraffin-embedded specimens was determined by differential PCR. Nineteen out of 66 (28.8%) breast cancer patients showed amplification of the gene. No gene amplification was found in benign breast disease. There was no significant correlation of HER-2/neu amplification with, age, menopausal status, the number of positive nodes, tumor size, estrogen receptor, however, amplification of HER-2/neu gene was strongly correlated with nodal status (p \u003d 0.0049). In node positive patients, the incidence of HER-2/neu amplification was high (43%). These findings indicate that the amplification of HER-2/neu gene may be of pathogenetic significance in breast cancer and may have a poor prognosis in node positive breast cancer patients while no gene amplification in benign breast disease suggests that HER-2/neu amplification is a late molecular alteration event in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.","title":"The significance of HER-2/neu/c-erbB-2 gene amplification in benign and malignant breast disease.","pubmedId":"9561622"}
