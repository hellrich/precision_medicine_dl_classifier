Here, we report that mTOR inhibition blocked malignant progression in K-ras(LA1) mice, which undergo somatic activation of the K-ras oncogene and display morphologic changes in alveolar epithelial cells that recapitulate those of precursors of human lung adenocarcinoma. Levels of phospho-S6(Ser236/235), a downstream mediator of mTOR, increased with malignant progression (normal alveolar epithelial cells to adenocarcinoma) in K-ras(LA1) mice and in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Atypical alveolar hyperplasia, an early neoplastic change, was prominently associated with macrophages and expressed high levels of phospho-S6(Ser236/235). mTOR inhibition in K-ras(LA1) mice by treatment with the rapamycin analogue CCI-779 reduced the size and number of early epithelial neoplastic lesions (atypical alveolar hyperplasia and adenomas) and induced apoptosis of intraepithelial macrophages. LKR-13, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line derived from K-ras(LA1) mice, was resistant to treatment with CCI-779 in vitro. However, LKR-13 cells grown as syngeneic tumors recruited macrophages, and those tumors regressed in response to treatment with CCI-779. Lastly, conditioned medium from primary cultures of alveolar macrophages stimulated the proliferation of LKR-13 cells. These findings provide evidence that the expansion of lung adenocarcinoma precursors induced by oncogenic K-ras requires mTOR-dependent signaling and that host factors derived from macrophages play a critical role in adenocarcinoma progression.","title":"Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin reverses alveolar epithelial neoplasia induced by oncogenic K-ras.","pubmedId":"15833854"}
