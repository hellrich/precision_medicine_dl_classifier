We investigated the prevalence and distribution of mutations in these genes in different melanoma tissues.\nIn all, 291 tumor tissues from 132 patients with melanoma were screened. Paired samples of primary melanomas (n \u003d 102) and synchronous or asynchronous metastases from the same patients (n \u003d 165) were included. Tissue samples underwent mutation analysis (automated DNA sequencing). Secondary lesions included lymph nodes (n \u003d 84), and skin (n \u003d 36), visceral (n \u003d 25), and brain (n \u003d 44) sites.\nBRAF/NRAS mutations were identified in 58% of primary melanomas (43% BRAF; 15% NRAS); 62% in lymph nodes, 61% subcutaneous, 56% visceral, and 70% in brain sites. Mutations were observed in 63% of metastases (48% BRAF; 15% NRAS), a nonsignificant increase in mutation frequency after progression from primary melanoma. Of the paired samples, lymph nodes (93% consistency) and visceral metastases (96% consistency) presented a highly similar distribution of BRAF/NRAS mutations versus primary melanomas, with a significantly less consistent pattern in brain (80%) and skin metastases (75%). This suggests that independent subclones are generated in some patients. p16CDKN2A mutations were identified in 7% and 14% of primary melanomas and metastases, with a low consistency (31%) between secondary and primary tumor samples.\nIn the era of targeted therapies, assessment of the spectrum and distribution of alterations in molecular targets among patients with melanoma is needed. Our findings about the prevalence of BRAF/NRAS/p16CDKN2A mutations in paired tumor lesions from patients with melanoma may be useful in the management of this disease.","title":"BRAF/NRAS mutation frequencies among primary tumors and metastases in patients with melanoma.","pubmedId":"22614978"}
