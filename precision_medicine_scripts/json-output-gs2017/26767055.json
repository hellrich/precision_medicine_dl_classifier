Intrapulmonary Castleman disease is very rare. Here, we present a patient with intrapulmonary Castleman disease who underwent left upper pulmonary lobectomy for suspected early lung cancer. The histopathologic diagnosis of the lobar mass was hyaline-type Castleman disease. The patient has remained well after surgery, showing no local recurrence or distant disease during a two-year follow-up period. Although unicentric Castleman disease originating in the lung is rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of primary pulmonary malignant tumors.
