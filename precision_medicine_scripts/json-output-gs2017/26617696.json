Prdx1 confers an aggressive survival phenotype of cancer cells and drug-resistance, yet its role in hilar cholangiocarcinoma is not fully investigated. In present study, we detected the expression profile of Prdx1 in 88 hilar cholangiocarcinoma by tissue arrays and immunohistochemistry. Prdx1 level was down-regulated by specific Prdx1-shRNA in vitro and the possible mechanism was investigated. Overexpression of Prdx1 was observed in 53 of 88 cases (60.2%). Prdx1 expression was significantly associated with tumor invasion, nodal metastasis, advanced disease stage. Down-regulation of Prdx1 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation of QBC939 cells and reduced the level of SNAT1 expression. Patients with Prdx1 overexpression had a shorter disease-free survival and overall survival than those without Prdx1 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that Prdx1 was an independent prognostic factor for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. The data indicate that Prdx1 may contribute to the development and progression of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, partially through regulating SNAT1 expression, and may be used as a biomarker in predicting the outcome of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Overexpression of Prdx1 in hilar cholangiocarcinoma: a predictor for recurrence and prognosis.","pubmedId":"26617696"}
