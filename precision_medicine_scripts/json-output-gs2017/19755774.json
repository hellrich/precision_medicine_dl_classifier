Deep vein thrombosis and thomboembolic events are frequent in these patients. Hormone imbalance and co-existent mutations in the coagulation system may be the primary factors in this hypercoagulable state. The increased thromboembolic risk in hypogonadic men has been explained by hypofibrinolysis due to androgen deficiency. Regarding the association between KS and congenital and acquired thrombophilias, to date, only three cases have been. Here, we present the youngest KS case with pulmonary thromboembolism with the heterozygous mutations in factor V Leiden and prothrombin genes, as detected by further tests. He had the previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and body mass index was 30 kg/m(2). Our report discusses the prothrombotic state in KS patients, with other possible causes for the young presentation and the importance of necessary tests in emergency service admissions with embolism.","title":"Serious venous thromboembolism, heterozygous factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome and type 2 diabetes.","pubmedId":"19755774"}
