She had previously been well and she had no family history of malignancy. While receiving treatment with erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor small-molecule inhibitor, she progressed and developed new brain metastases. She failed further chemotherapy treatments and subsequently developed extensive symptomatic leptomeningeal carcinomatosis associated with diplopia, hemiparesis, weight loss, and incontinence.\nChest X-ray, head and chest CT scan, R2 lymph-node biopsy, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, MRI of head and spine, lumbar puncture, laser microdissection and EGFR genomic DNA sequencing of the R2 lymph node and cerebrospinal fluid tumor cells.\nErlotinib-refractory stage IV lung adenocarcinoma and end-stage symptomatic leptomeningeal metastases with a novel double L858R + E884K somatic mutation of the EGFR.\nCarboplatin, paclitaxel and erlotinib, whole-brain radiotherapy, temozolomide with and without irinotecan, and gefitinib.","title":"Gefitinib response of erlotinib-refractory lung cancer involving meninges--role of EGFR mutation.","pubmedId":"16407879"}
