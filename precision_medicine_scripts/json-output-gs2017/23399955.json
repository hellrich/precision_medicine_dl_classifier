Identifying genetic features of this disorder could improve management and especially surveillance of these patients. We sought to determine the prevalence of hamartomatous polyposis-associated mutations in the susceptibility genes PTEN, BMPR1A, SMAD4, ENG, and STK11 in individuals with ≥5 gastrointestinal polyps, including at least 1 hamartomatous or hyperplastic/serrated polyp.\nWe performed a prospective, referral-based study of 603 patients (median age: 51 years; range, 2-89 years) enrolled from June 2006 through January 2012. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes and analyzed for specific mutations and large rearrangements in PTEN, BMPR1A, SMAD4, and STK11, as well as mutations in ENG. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to determine cutoffs for continuous variables. The prevalence of mutations was compared using Fisher\u0027s exact test. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine univariate and multivariate risk factors.\nOf 603 patients, 119 (20%) had a personal history of colorectal cancer and most (n \u003d 461 [76%]) had \u003c30 polyps. Seventy-seven patients (13%) were found to have polyposis-associated mutations, including 11 in ENG (1.8%), 13 in PTEN (2.2%), 13 in STK11 (2.2%), 20 in BMPR1A (3.3%), and 21 in SMAD4 (3.5%). Univariate clinical predictors for risk of having these mutations included age at presentation younger than 40 years (19% vs 10%; P \u003d .008), a polyp burden of ≥30 (19% vs 11%; P \u003d .014), and male sex (16% vs 10%; P \u003d .03). Patients who had ≥1 ganglioneuroma (29% vs 2%; P \u003c .001) or presented with polyps of ≥3 histologic types (20% vs 2%; P \u003d .003) were more likely to have germline mutations in PTEN.\nAge younger than 40 years, male sex, and specific polyp histologies are significantly associated with risk of germline mutations in hamartomatous-polyposis associated genes. These associations could guide clinical decision making and further investigations.","title":"Prevalence of germline PTEN, BMPR1A, SMAD4, STK11, and ENG mutations in patients with moderate-load colorectal polyps.","pubmedId":"23399955"}
