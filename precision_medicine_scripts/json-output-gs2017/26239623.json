Thus, identification of novel therapeutic targets is highly desirable. Here, we examined gene copy number of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), a potential target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and clinicopathologic parameters in a large cohort of gastric adenocarcinomas. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of 293 gastric adenocarcinomas using tissue microarrays. Amplification of the FGFR1 gene is a rare but noticeable event that can be found in 2% (6/293) of cases and was associated with poor 10-year survival (median 15.3 months in FGFR1-amplified cases versus 36 months in nonamplified cases, P \u003d .047) and a higher rate of distant metastasis (P \u003d .025). FGFR1 appears to represent a potential new therapeutic target in a subset of patients with gastric carcinoma. Identification of gastric cancers harboring FGFR1 amplification may be important in preselecting patients and/or interpreting clinical studies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
