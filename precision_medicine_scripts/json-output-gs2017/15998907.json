Direct sequencing of exons 18 to 24 of EGFR and exons 18 to 24 of ERBB2 was performed using DNA extracted from surgical specimens. Pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to analyze the allelic pattern and copy number of EGFR.\nThirty-nine patients (59%) had EGFR mutations; 20 patients had deletional mutations in exon 19, 17 patients had missense mutations (L858R) in exon 21, and two patients had missense mutations (G719S or G719C) in exon 18. No mutations were identified in ERBB2. Response rate (82% [32 of 39 patients] v 11% [three of 27 patients]; P \u003c .0001), time to progression (TTP; median, 12.6 v 1.7 months; P \u003c .0001), and overall survival (median, 20.4 v 6.9 months; P \u003d .0001) were significantly better in patients with EGFR mutations than in patients with wild-type EGFR. Increased EGFR copy numbers (\u003e or \u003d 3/cell) were observed in 29 patients (44%) and were significantly associated with a higher response rate (72% [21 of 29 patients] v 38% [14 of 37 patients]; P \u003d .005) and a longer TTP (median, 9.4 v 2.6 months; P \u003d .038). High EGFR copy numbers (\u003e or \u003d 6/cell) were caused by selective amplification of mutant alleles.\nEGFR mutations and increased copy numbers were significantly associated with better clinical outcome in gefitinib-treated NSCLC patients.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations and increased copy numbers predict gefitinib sensitivity in patients with recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"15998907"}
