A 52-year-old woman presented with polydipsia, polyuria, and loss of appetite. She was diagnosed as having diabetes insipidus caused by pituitary micrometatasis of lung adenocarcinoma. After she had been treated with radiation therapy to the pituitary gland, the gland size was reduced as confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, and her urine volume decreased. However, meningitis carcinomatosa appeared later. This was a rare case of secondary diabetes insipidus due to pituitary metastasis of lung cancer.","title":"Central diabetes insipidus caused by pituitary metastasis of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"8580569"}
