Our aim in this study was to evaluate patient characteristics, treatment strategy, and postoperative follow-up of patients with colorectal squamous cell carcinoma.\nWe reviewed our prospectively maintained colorectal cancer database for all patients who were diagnosed with colorectal squamous cell carcinoma between January 1990 and April 2009.\nOut of 5149 patients with colorectal malignancy, 11 patients (0.2%) met the study criteria. Median age at the time of diagnosis was 64. Median BMI was 28 kg/m2. The tumors were localized in the rectum (n \u003d 8), right colon (n \u003d 2), and sigmoid colon (n \u003d 1). The pathologic stages of these tumors were I (n \u003d 1), II (n \u003d 4), III (n \u003d 3), and IV (n \u003d 3). Operations performed were abdominoperineal resection (n \u003d 4), right colectomy (n \u003d 2), total colectomy (n \u003d 1), low anterior resection (n \u003d 1), local excision (n \u003d 1), sigmoidectomy (n\u003d1) and end colostomy creation (n \u003d 1). One patient received intraoperative radiotherapy. Postoperative chemotherapy was given to eight patients, and three patients received postoperative radiation therapy. Median follow-up after diagnosis was 42 months (12-96). Three patients developed recurrence after potentially curative surgery. Five patients died from metastatic disease during follow-up.\nSquamous colorectal cancer can be detected in any part of the colon, generally presents at a later stage, and is associated with a poor prognosis. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment. Various adjuvant chemoradiation treatments appear not to influence the outcome. Further cases need to be analyzed in order to find more effective treatment regimens.","title":"Colorectal squamous cell carcinoma: a rare tumor with poor prognosis.","pubmedId":"25392258"}
