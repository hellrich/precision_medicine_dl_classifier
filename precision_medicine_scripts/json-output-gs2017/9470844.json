In this study, expression of the c-erbB-3 protein was examined in 57 cases of pure ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS) by immuno-cytochemical methods. Staining was either absent (17 cases), present at levels equivalent to that found in adjacent normal tissue (20) or greater than in normal tissue (20). In most cases the pattern of staining was cytoplasmic, but in 4 cases with the most intense reaction there was also focal membrane staining. In the same series of cases, c-erbB-2 protein had previously been shown to be overexpressed in 28 of 57 cases, c-erbB-2 overexpression was correlated with normal level of c-erbB-3, and lack of c-erbB-2 expression was correlated with c-erbB-3 overexpression.","title":"c-erbB-3 protein expression in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.","pubmedId":"9470844"}
