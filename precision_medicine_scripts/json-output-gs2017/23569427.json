The body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) and hepatic histological changes were detected and compared between the two groups. The association of these factors with hepatic steatosis was evaluated in CHB patients.\nBMI, FPG, TG, TC, GGT, AST and HBV DNA showed statistically significant differences between two groups (P\u003c0.01). The patients with hepatic steatosis had markedly higher BMI, FBG, TG and TC than those without steatosis did. No significant differences were found in ALT and HBeAg between two groups (P\u003e0.05). In male patients, there was marked difference in the WHR between two groups (P \u003c 0.01), which was not found in female patients (P \u003e 0.05). The severity of hepatic steatosis increased in patients with hepatic steatosis, compared to those without steatosis (P \u003c 0.01), but the severities of inflammation and fibrosis in the non-hepatic steatosis group were dramatically higher than those in the hepatic steatosis group (P \u003c 0.01).\nBMI, WHR, FBG, TG and TC appeared to be influencing factors of CHB combined with hepatic steatosis. Hepatic steatosis in CHB patients was closely related to changes in anthropometric indices and metabolic factors but not HBV. It is necessary to improve these factors to effectively prevent hepatic steatosis in CHB patients.","title":"Clinical and virological characteristics of chronic hepatitis B patients with hepatic steatosis.","pubmedId":"23569427"}
