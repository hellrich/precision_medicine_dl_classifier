Here, we identify four novel naturally occurring NRAS isoforms (isoforms 2-5) in addition to the canonical isoform (isoform 1). Expression analyses performed on a panel of several different human malignancies and matching normal tissue revealed distinct isoform expression patterns. Two of the novel isoforms were found in the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas the others were exclusively cytoplasmic. The isoforms varied in their binding affinities to known downstream targets and differentially regulated the RAS signaling pathway. Strikingly, forced expression of isoform 5, which encodes only a 20-aa peptide, led to increased cell proliferation and to transformation by activation of known NRAS targets. These discoveries open new avenues in the study of NRAS. ","title":"NRAS isoforms differentially affect downstream pathways, cell growth, and cell transformation.","pubmedId":"24586049"}
