In Northern and RT-PCR analyses, we found that the expression of mRNA of 14 genes was elevated in pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with the levels in normal pancreatic tissues. In addition, the expression of mRNA of hsp105 in colon cancer was greater than that in normal colon tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-hsp105 antibody revealed that an increased expression of hsp105 is a characteristic feature of pancreatic ductal and colon adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, hsp105 immunoreactivity in some cases of gastric, esophageal, and hepatocellular carcinoma was much stronger than that in normal corresponding tissues. These molecules identified may provide good diagnostic markers for cancer cells.","title":"Gene cloning of immunogenic antigens overexpressed in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"11237751"}
