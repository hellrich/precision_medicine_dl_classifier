The persisting grim lung cancer mortality figures argue powerfully for new approaches for controlling this disease such as chemoprevention that has been defined as the use of agents that inhibit or reverse lung carcinogenesis. Carcinogens from cigarette smoke are implicated in about 90% of male and 75-80% of female lung cancer deaths. Confoundingly epidemiologic studies show that only about 15% of heavy smokers will ultimately develop lung cancer. The fact that 85% of heavy smokers will not develop lung cancer points to a variation in individual susceptibility. It also suggests that modulation of susceptibility might be used as a preventive strategy. This review summarizes the outcomes of recent clinical chemoprevention trials and reveals that the chemoprevention approach in lung cancer is still experimental.","title":"Chemoprevention of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"11741000"}
