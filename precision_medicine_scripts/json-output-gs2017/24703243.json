A prime example is mutant BRAF, which drives OIS in melanocytic nevi. Progression to melanoma occurs only in the context of additional alteration(s) like the suppression of PTEN, which abrogates OIS. Here, we performed a near-genomewide short hairpin (sh)RNA screen for novel OIS regulators and identified by next generation sequencing and functional validation seven genes. While all but one were upregulated in OIS, depletion of each of them abrogated BRAF(V) (600E) -induced arrest. With genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, we found one of these genes, RASEF, to be hypermethylated in primary cutaneous melanomas but not nevi. Bypass of OIS by depletion of RASEF was associated with suppression of several senescence biomarkers including senescence-associated (SA)-β-galactosidase activity, interleukins, and tumor suppressor p15(INK) (4B) . Restoration of RASEF expression inhibited proliferation. These results illustrate the power of shRNA OIS bypass screens and identify a potential novel melanoma suppressor gene.","title":"Near-genomewide RNAi screening for regulators of BRAF(V600E) -induced senescence identifies RASEF, a gene epigenetically silenced in melanoma.","pubmedId":"24703243"}
