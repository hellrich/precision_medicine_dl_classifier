Based upon TaqMan-ARMS, the classification was as followed: adenocarcinoma (35.0% (36/103)), squamous carcinoma (2.2% (2/93)) and adenosquamous carcinoma (0). According to DNA sequencing, they were 19.6% (39/199), 35.9% (37/103), 2.2% (2/93) and 0 respectively. Thus, no statistically significant difference existed between two methods (McNemar Test, P \u003d 1.000, Îº \u003d 0.984). The mutation rate of adenocarcinoma was higher than those of squamous and adenosquamous carcinoma.\nThe detection of EGFR mutations is highly consistent in the NSCLC tissue by the methods of TaqMan-ARMS and DNA sequencing.","title":"[Value of detecting epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in non-small cell lung cancer tissue by TaqMan-amplification refractory mutation system].","pubmedId":"23755816"}
