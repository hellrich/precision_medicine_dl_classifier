The patient\u0027s age, first visit or not, cause for treatment, awareness of cervical cancer now as well as that before diagnosis of the disease, the last cervical cancer screening\u0027 time and the clinical stage were recorded. The results of questionnaires were analyzed with SPSS 16.0.\n(1) One hundred and thirty-eight cases were collected and the average age was (48 Â± 10) years old. Concerning the awareness level, the patients were divided into three groups of 10 points, 5 points and 0 point based on the score of the second parts of the questionnaires. The number of the patients of the above three groups were 114 (82.6%), 18 (13.0%) and 6 (4.3%) at present, while before the cancer diagnosis the number of the patients of the above three groups were 5 (3.6%), 13 (9.4%) and 120 (87.0%). Patient\u0027s awareness level was much higher now than that before the cancer diagnosis (P \u003c 0.05). (2) Based on the last cervical cancer screening time, the patients were divided into four groups including within one year (group 1), a year ago but within three years (group 2), three years ago (group 3) and never done (group 4). There were 9 (6.5%) cases in group 1, 30 (21.7%) cases in group 2, 29 (21.0%) cases in group 3 and 70 (50.7%) cases in group 4. There were 5 (5/9) cases with stage Ia, 3 (3/9) cases with stage Ib and 1 (1/9) case with stage II or above in group 1; 11 (36.7%, 11/30) cases with stage Ia, 15 (50.0%, 15/30) cases with stage Ib and 4 (13.3%, 4/30) cases with stage II or above in group 2; 5 (17.2%, 5/29) cases with stage Ia, 14 (48.3%, 14/29) cases with stage Ib was and 10 (34.5%, 10/29) cases with stage II or above in group 3; 7 (10.0%, 7/70) cases stage with Ia, 35 (50.0%, 35/70) cases with stage Ib and 28 (40.0%, 28/70) cases with stage II or above in group 4. The results showed that there was an increasing trend of advanced cervical carcinoma at diagnosis for the patients with longer last cervical cancer screening time (P \u003c 0.05).\nPeople\u0027s awareness level is much higher after being educated in cervical cancer. Among the cervical cancer patients, the probability of diagnosed patients with advanced cervical cancer has an increasing trend when their screening situation is poor. To raise the screening attendance rate among appropriate women, we should spread knowledge of cervical cancer to the population.","title":"[Changes in awareness of cervical cancer patients after medical treatments and the correlation of cervical screening situation and clinical stage at consultation].","pubmedId":"22883525"}
