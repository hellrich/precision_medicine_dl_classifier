The various NTRK1 fusions described so far lead to constitutive activation of TRKA kinase activity and are oncogenic. We further investigated here the existence and the frequency of NTRK1 gene rearrangements in colorectal cancer. Using immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, we analyzed a series of human colorectal cancers. We identified two TRKA positive cases over 408, with NTRK1 chromosomal rearrangements. One of these rearrangements is a TPM3-NTRK1 fusion already observed in colon cancer, while the second one is a TPR-NTRK1 fusion never described in this type of cancer. These findings further confirm that translocations in the NTRK1 gene are recurring events in colorectal cancer, although occurring at a low frequency (around 0.5%).
