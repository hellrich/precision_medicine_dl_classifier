While several calibrations on meat quality parameters have been published, the accuracy and robustness of a calibration has rarely been validated with independent samples. In this study, in 207 loin muscles from three independent batches of pigs of different breeds drip loss, colour values, pH and intramuscular fat were determined. Calibrations were made from each combination of two batches and validated with the third batch. Validations of pH, intramuscular fat, drip loss, and L(∗), a(∗), and b(∗) colour values had on average 1.27 times the accuracy of the calibration. Breed did not influence the accuracy of the calibration. Intramuscular fat can be determined with good accuracy. Muscle pH and colour values are reasonably well predicted. Drip loss can not be determined quantitatively with sufficient accuracy, but classification of quality groups is possible.","title":"Prediction of pork quality using visible/near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy.","pubmedId":"22062068"}
