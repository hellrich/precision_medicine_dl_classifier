Germline inactivation of the gene LKB1/STK11 have been shown to cause Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) associated with a approximately 100-fold higher risk for the development of pancreatic cancer. We have analysed 39 index patients from European FPC families for mutations of LKB1/STK11 by sequencing of their DNA. No germline mutation was found within the complete coding region. Therefore, our results indicate that LKB1/STK11 is not altered in the germline of patients with hereditary pancreatic cancer.","title":"No evidence for germline mutations of the LKB1/STK11 gene in familial pancreatic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"15331174"}
