Whether variations in cardiac arrest outcome are the result of differences in hospital or patient characteristics remains understudied. We tested whether hospital-independent factors would account for the difference in outcome between 2 geographically distinct hospitals.\nConsecutive adult (age \u003e18 years) out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were considered for analysis. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Predictor variables were classified according to whether they were hospital-independent or whether they could be related to the hospital\u0027s quality of care. Only hospital-independent variables were considered for the analysis. Sequential logistic modeling was used to assess outcome. A propensity score was derived and was used in subsequent multivariate logistic regression to predict hospital outcome. A total of 208 subjects were included. Overall mortality in the Detroit cohort was 87% in comparison with 61% in the Boston cohort (odds ratio: 4.4; 95% confidence interval: 2.2-8.8). After sequential adjustments for baseline covariates, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest score and propensity score, city was not significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio: 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 0.45-2.97). After propensity matching there was no significant difference in the odds ratio for death between the 2 cities (odds ratio: 1.15; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-2.61).\nIn this pilot study, we found that pre- and intra-arrest conditions contribute substantially to the severity of the postarrest syndrome and on outcomes. Postarrest quality-of-care evaluations should include inherent differences in the presenting syndrome rather than a crude mortality rate.","title":"A pilot study examining the severity and outcome of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome: a comparative analysis of two geographically distinct hospitals.","pubmedId":"22879369"}
