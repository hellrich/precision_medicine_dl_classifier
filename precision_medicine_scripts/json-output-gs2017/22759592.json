High-throughput sequencing of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma as well as neuroendocrine tumors and rarer subtypes of cancers of the pancreas has revealed several novel mutations in genes like PALB2, guanine nucleotide-binding protein, alpha stimulating, death-domain-associated protein, Î± thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X linked, switch/sucrose nonfermentable pathway related, and in genes in the ubiquitin-dependent pathways such as USP9X. Therapeutic targeting of the tumor-stroma axis by cytokines and immune response modulators and the role of autophagy in pancreatic cancer are some other salient themes explored in the recent publications.\nRecent publications shed new light on the mutational landscape of pancreatic cancer and further delineate the distinctive pancreatic cancer-stroma ecosystem as determined by the dynamic interplay of inflammation, hallmark mutations, EMT, and cancer stem cells.","title":"Emerging frontiers in pancreatic cancer research:  elaboration of key genes, cells and the extracellular milieu.","pubmedId":"22759592"}
