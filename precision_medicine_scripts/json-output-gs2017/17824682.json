It is the fourth leading cause of cancer death with a 2% 5-year survival rate. Biomarkers for its early detection are lacking. This study was designed to use a proteomics-based approach as a means of identifying antigens that elicit a humoral response in PDAC patients. Antibodies against PDAC-associated antigens are useful for early cancer diagnosis and therapy. Proteins from PDAC cell lines were separated by 2-DE, and the serum IgG reactivity of 70 PDAC patients, 40 healthy subjects (HS), 30 non-PDAC tumor patients, and 15 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients was tested by Western blot analysis. Spots specifically recognized by PDAC sera and revealed by mass spectrometry corresponded to metabolic enzymes or cytoskeletal proteins. Most were up-regulated in PDAC tissues. Thus, it seems that metabolic enzymes and cytoskeletal proteins are specific targets of the humoral response during PDAC. The results of further studies of these serological-defined antigens could be of diagnostic and therapeutic significance in PDAC.","title":"Autoantibody signature in human ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"17824682"}
