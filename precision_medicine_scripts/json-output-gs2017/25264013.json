The deadline is July 2013. We sorted and analyzed these articles with Endnote X6 from the aspects of published year, the first author, name of journal, published institution, cited frequency and publication type.\n932 English articles were included in our research after deleting the duplicates. The first article on bacterial quantitative proteomics was reported in 1999. The maximal publications were 163 related articles in 2012. Up till July 2013, authors from more than 23 countries and regions have published articles in this field. China ranks the fourth. The main publication type is original articles. The most frequently cited article is entitled with \"Absolute quantification of proteins by LCMSE: a virtue of parallel MS acquisition\" by Silva JC, Gorenstein MV, Li GZ, et al in Mol Cell Proteomics 2006. The most productive author is Smith RD from Biological Sciences Division, Pac. Northwest National Laboratory. The top journal publishing bacterial quantitative proteomics is Proteomics.\nMore and more researchers pay attention to quantitative proteomics which will be widely used in bacteriology.","title":"[Bibliometric analysis of bacterial quantitative proteomics in English literatures].","pubmedId":"25264013"}
