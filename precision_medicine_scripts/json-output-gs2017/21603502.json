They arise from a precursor cell in the myenteric plexus, and most tumors express a characteristic CD117 antigen, which is part of a tyrosine kinase receptor. This finding has led to the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents targeted at these receptors and has revolutionized the treatment of these tumors, which had been historically disappointing. Surgery is recommended for tumors \u003e2 cm in size and even has a role in metastatic disease. The approach to tumors \u003c2 cm in size is more controversial, as these lesions tend to be less aggressive, but the true malignant potential of GISTs can only be determined by surgical resection and histologic evaluation.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors-diagnosis and management: a brief review.","pubmedId":"21603502"}
