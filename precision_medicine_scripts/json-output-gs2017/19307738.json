Imatinib was administered orally at 400 mg once daily. In case of disease progression, the dose was escalated to 600 mg once daily, then 400 mg twice daily. KIT and PDGFRA mutations were analyzed in 29 of the 47 patients.\nImatinib produced partial responses in 30 patients (63.8%; 95% confidence interval, 50.1-77.6%) and stable disease in 13 patients (27.7%). The median time to response was 2.6 months (range, 1.0-6.2 months). With a median follow-up of 62 months (range, 32-67 months), 4-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 50 and 65%, respectively. The most common adverse events were anemia, neutropenia, edema, and skin rash (predominantly of grade 1-2). There were no treatment-related deaths. In the subset evaluated for mutational status, 24 patients (82.8%) had KIT exon 11 mutations and 1 (3.4%) had a KIT exon 9 mutation.\nImatinib is effective and safe in Korean patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST.","title":"A prospective, multicenter, phase 2 study of imatinib mesylate in korean patients with metastatic or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","pubmedId":"19307738"}
