The shunt vessel which was demonstrated in this case by fluorescein angiography is identified with the optociliary vein reported in the literature. Fluorograms also revealed peculiar vessels at the margin of the optic disc, which have not been described in association with this tumor. CT scanning and roentgenograms of the optic canal proved useful as diagnostic tools for this tumor. The tumor was removed through a frontotemporal craniotomy, preserving the optic nerve. The histopathological diagnosis was meningothelial meningioma.","title":"Optociliary veins associated with meningioma of the optic nerve sheath.","pubmedId":"7231886"}
