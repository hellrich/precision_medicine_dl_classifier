Three transcription factors that activate (USF, NF-kappaB, and Elf1) and a single factor that represses (SLUG) BRCA2 promoter activity have been reported. In addition, a 67-bp region (-582 to -516) associated with inhibition of promoter activity has been identified. However, it remains unclear how the 67-bp region contributes to regulation of BRCA2 expression. Here, we describe the affinity purification of a 120-kDa protein that binds to a silencer-binding region within the 67-bp repression region of the BRCA2 promoter. Mass spectrometry revealed the identity of the protein as poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (Parp-1). Gel shift, antibody super-shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that Parp-1 is associated with the BRCA2 promoter both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Parp-1 inhibitors (either 3-AB or NU1025) and Parp-1 gene specific siRNA resulted in increased levels of endogenous BRCA2 expression. Inhibition of Parp-1 activity (by 3-AB) reduced histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation and blocked Parp-1 binding to the BRCA2 promoter. These results indicate that Parp-1 down-regulates BRCA2 expression through an interaction with a repression region of the BRCA2 promoter.","title":"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 down-regulates BRCA2 expression through the BRCA2 promoter.","pubmedId":"18990703"}
