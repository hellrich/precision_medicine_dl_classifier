A pilot study of sustained-release somatostatin yielded promising results. Pasireotide LAR is a long-acting somatostatin analog with higher affinity for most somatostatin receptor subtypes than octreotide.  Methods:  This was a phase II trial of monthly pasireotide LAR 60 mg IM in patients with recurrent or progressive meningioma. Patients were stratified by histology (cohort A: atypical [grade 2] and malignant [grade 3] meningiomas; cohort B: benign [WHO grade 1] meningiomas). Treatment cycles were 28 days. Restaging MRIs were performed every 3 cycles and response was assessed using Macdonald criteria. Octreotide scanning was performed at baseline. Tumor tissue was obtained for somatostatin receptor immunohistochemistry. Serum IGF-1 levels were checked serially.  Results:  18 patients in cohort A and 16 in cohort B were accrued. Cohort A had median age 59 (range 39-74), 8 men (44%), median KPS 80 (range 60-100), 17 (94%) with previous radiation therapy. Cohort B had median age 52 (range 36-81), 9 men (56%), median KPS 90 (range 70-100), 11 (69%) with previous radiation therapy. There were no responses. Twelve patients in cohort A (67%) achieved stable disease for a median of 4 cycles, and 13 patients in Cohort B (81%) achieved stable disease for a median of 7 cycles. In Cohort A, PFS6 was 17% and median PFS 15 weeks (95% CI: 8-20). In Cohort B, PFS6 was 50% and median PFS 26 weeks (12-43). Toxicity was mild except for grade 3 hyperglycemia in 5 (15%) patients, grade 4 hyperglycemia in 1 (3%) patient, grade 4 hypoglycemia in 1 (3%) patient, grade 3 hypokalemia in 1 (3%) patient, grade 3 fatigue in 2 (6%) patients, grade 3 amylase elevation in 1 (3%) patient, and grade 3 lipase elevation in 2 (6%) patients. Neither octreotide uptake nor IGF-1 levels predicted outcome. Staining for sst3 was predictive of favorable OS (HR 0.44, p\u003d0.02) and PFS (HR 0.64, p\u003d0.04).   Conclusions:  Pasireotide LAR is inactive in most recurrent meningiomas. Tumors with increased sst3 expression may be particularly sensitive to pasireotide, for reasons that remain to be determined.
