Intrahepatic CC (ICC) is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and accounts for 10-15% of primary liver cancers. ICC differs from both extrahepatic and CC and HCC and has unique risk factors, histological features, genetic alterations and clinical outcomes. The natural history and results of surgical intervention are not well described as ICC is a relatively uncommon tumor, especially in the USA. This article reviews the literature relevant to the surgical management and outcome of patients with ICC in the USA.
