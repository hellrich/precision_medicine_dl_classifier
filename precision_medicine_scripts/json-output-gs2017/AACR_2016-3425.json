Using data from the international Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR), we assessed the association between pre-diagnostic alcohol intake and survival outcomes after CRC diagnosis, overall and stratified by patient and tumor attributes. CRC cases were identified via population-based cancer registries at four CCFR study sites, with diagnoses of incident, invasive CRC from 1997 to 2006. Study participants completed a risk factor questionnaire at enrollment which included information on several pre-diagnostic behaviors, including consumption of wine, beer, and liquor. Prospective follow-up for survival outcomes was conducted for 4858 CRC cases with complete data on alcohol consumption. Using Cox proportional hazards regression models with delayed entry to account for the time between diagnosis and study enrollment, we compared non-drinkers (i.e., alcohol intake \u003c1 drink per week) to individuals who consumed, on average, \u003c1 serving of alcohol per day (but 1 per week), and those who consumed 1 serving per day in the years preceding CRC diagnosis. Separate analyses were carried out for overall and disease-specific survival. All models were adjusted for age at diagnosis, sex, study site, year of diagnosis, smoking history, CRC screening history, and body mass index. Over a mean follow-up of 7.5 years, 1872 (39%) study participants died, 1110 (59%) of whom died from CRC. Pre-diagnostic beer and liquor consumption were not associated with CRC survival; however, consumption of 1 serving of wine per day was modestly associated with more favorable overall [hazard ratio (HR) \u003d 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-1.00] and disease-specific survival (HR \u003d 0.83, 95% CI: 0.62-1.12). In stratified analyses, having consumed 1 serving of wine per day was slightly, but not statistically significantly, more strongly associated with overall survival among men than among women (HR \u003d 0.71 vs. 0.91, respectively, p-heterogeneity \u003d 0.12) and among those aged 50 than those aged \u003e50 years (HR \u003d 0.66 vs. 0.84, p-heterogeneity \u003d 0.35). Similar patterns were noted with respect to disease-specific survival. There were no differences in the relationships between wine consumption and survival outcomes stratified by tumor site, microsatellite instability, BRAF-mutation, or CpG island methylator phenotype status. These results suggest that wine consumption prior to CRC diagnosis is modestly associated with more favorable survival after CRC diagnosis. This modest inverse association does not appear to be limited to specific colorectal tumor subtypes and extends beyond overall survival to disease-specific outcomes.","title":"Prediagnostic alcohol consumption and colorectal cancer survival: the Colon Cancer Family Registry","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3425"}
