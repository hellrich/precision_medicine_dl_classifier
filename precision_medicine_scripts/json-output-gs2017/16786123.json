Immunohistochemical analysis for p-Akt and p-mTOR expression was performed on paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens from 25 patients with advanced cervical cancer (stage Ib2-IIb). We correlated this finding with various clinicopathological variables and prognosis by uni- and multivariate analyses. All patients received cisplatin-based NAC, and primary tumor response was evaluated by RECIST criteria and then classified as a positive or negative response. Activation of Akt was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cancer cells in 12 patients (48%), whereas p-mTOR was detected in the cytoplasm and membrane of the cancer cells in 13 patients (52%). Post NAC evaluation of the primary tumor revealed 68% (17/25) responsive tumors. The expression of p-mTOR and distant metastasis significantly correlated with the response to NAC (p \u003d 0.0101 and p \u003d 0.0107); however, there was no significant correlation between p-Akt and p-mTOR expression and any of the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients. In the univariate analysis, activated Akt and mTOR were found to be significant prognostic indicators (p \u003c 0.05). In multivariate analysis, p-mTOR expression retained its significance as an independent poor prognostic marker (p \u003d 0.0178). In summary, our present study showed that cervical cancer expressed Akt and mTOR activation. Moreover, the expression of phosphorylated mTOR may have a role as a marker to predict response to chemotherapy and survival of cervical cancer patients who are treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our results suggest that the mTOR cascade may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in cervical cancer.","title":"Predictive and prognostic role of activated mammalian target of rapamycin in cervical cancer treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"16786123"}
