Cancer cell stemness is also highly relevant to cancer in hypoxic environments.\nIn our study, we used cobalt dichloride (CoCl2) to create a hypoxic environment for lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and the cisplatine-resistant cell line A549/DDP. The cancer stem-like CD166 positive population and the cells\u0027 stemness were detected by flowcytometry and quantitative real-time PCR after separation using magnetic antibodies. Drug resistance to cisplatine, docetaxel and pemetrexed was also measured. Finally, a tissue array was used to analyze the relationship between hypoxia-induced stemness and overall survival after radical surgery.\nData showed that chemical-induced hypoxia changed cell stemness by enhancing stem cell transcription factors and markers of chemotherapeutic drug resistance. The CD166-positive cancer stem cell-like population showed greater drug resistance than the CD166-negative cells. Tissue array studies also suggested a poorer prognosis for patients whose tissue expressed higher CD166 levels.\nOur findings indicate that chemical hypoxia may augment cancer cell stemness and drug resistance in CD166-positive stem cells. Therefore, targeting the stem-like cell population, especially CD166-positive cells, may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat lung cancer.","title":"Hypoxia-induced cell stemness leads to drug resistance and poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25512094"}
