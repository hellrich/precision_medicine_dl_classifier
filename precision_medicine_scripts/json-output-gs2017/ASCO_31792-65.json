Although peculiar differences do exist between men and women, very little is known about the prognostic factors in male breast cancer, even though female breast cancer practical conducts are widely used in male breast cancer. The rarity of this condition makes very difficult to produce randomized trials. Methods: This study is populational and epidemiological and evaluated male breast cancer patients from January 1974 to December 2001 about its prognostic characteristics. Data were collected retrospectively and the sample has been described using descriptive statistics methods. Survival curve was built using Kaplan-Meier method. Staging system was standardized as in the sixth edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer, independently on when the diagnose was made. Due to differences throughtout 35 years on therapeutic on breast cancer, treatment options were categorized in groups to make the survival evaluation possible. Results: From 45 patients with male breast cancer, 91% presented ductal histology, 26% were negative axillary, 9.1% were T1, 25% were T2, 4.5% were T3, 50% were T4 and 12.12% presented with distant metastasis at diagnose. Seventy nine percent were submitted to radical local treatment, while 34% had not been submitted to any kind of systemic treatment (neoadjuvant, adjuvant e hormone therapy). Forty percent of patients have not presented distant recurrence, while 58.3% have not presented local recurrence. A median survival of 126 months has been observed to the analyzed population, ranging from 69-182 months. Five-year survival was 72% and 10-year survival was 54%. These data agreed with the available data in the published literature. Conclusions: Male breast cancer appears to behave biologically and clinically very similar to female breast cancer, but differences do exist and need to be elucidated. Randomized multi-center clinical trials become necessary, as systematic reviews, to build higher statistic power studies.","title":"Male breast cancer: Prognostic factors evaluation in a 35-year service.","pubmedId":"ASCO_31792-65"}
