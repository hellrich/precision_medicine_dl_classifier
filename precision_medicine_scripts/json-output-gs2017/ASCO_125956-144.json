A single founder mutation, p.Arg112dup, accounts for the majority of CDKN2A mutations in Swedish carriers. This mutation alters the peptide sequences of tumor suppressors p16-INK4A and p14-ARF. The aim of this study was to assess cancer risks in CDKN2A p.Arg112dup carriers and their first (FDRs) and second degree relatives (SDRS).  Methods:  In this prospective cohort study, cancer diagnoses in CDKN2A p.Arg112dup mutation carriers (n\u003d120), non-carriers (n\u003d111), carriers FDRs (n\u003d275) and SDRs (n\u003d321) and controls (n\u003d3976) were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Relative risks (RR) for cancers were calculated (number of cancers/person years). Due to the finding of high risks in mutation carriers of cancers that are normally associated with tobacco smoking, data was retrospectively collected on smoking history in carriers.  Odds ratios were calculated to compare smoking (ever-smoker/never-smoker) in carriers with or without a diagnosis of non-melanoma cancer. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for all RRs.  Results:  In carriers prospective RR for non-melanoma cancers was 5.0 (95% CI\u003d3.7-7.3), for pancreatic cancer 43.8 (95% CI\u003d13.8-139.0), for cancers in upper digestive tissues 17.1 (95% CI\u003d6.3-46.5), and in respiratory tissues 15.6 (5.4-46.0). In FDRs and SDRs, RRs were significantly elevated for cancers in pancreas, respiratory and upper digestive tissues. In ever-smoking carriers compared with never-smoking carriers, the odds ratio of cancers in pancreas, respiratory or upper digestive tissues was 9.3 (95% CI\u003d 1.9-44.7).   Conclusions:  CDKN2A p.Arg112dup mutation carriers from melanoma-prone families and their FDRs and SDRs have elevated risk for pancreatic, lung, head and neck and gastro-esophageal carcinomas. These cancers were mainly seen in ever-smoking carriers. This is the first study that shows association between smoking history and cancer diagnoses in CDKN2A mutation carriers. Germline CDKN2A mutations may confer an increased sensitivity to carcinogens in tobacco smoke. CDKN2A mutation carriers should be counseled to abstain from smoking.","title":"Risk of tobacco-related cancers in CDKN2A mutation-positive melanoma families.","pubmedId":"ASCO_125956-144"}
