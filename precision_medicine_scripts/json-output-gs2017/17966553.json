Initially the patient consulted with epigastric pain. MRI showed a giant tumour of the stomach wall, invading the surrounding organs, as well as the mediastinal region. After surgical \u0027en-bloc\u0027 resection of the tumour, histopathologic examination yielded a diagnosis of pleiomorphic liposarcoma. Because of the bad prognosis of this histologic type, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy: a combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide (MAI). Nine months after surgery, she represented with a relapse of the tumour that had become inoperable. Palliative chemotherapy was started with the intent to prolong the young patient\u0027s life. However 6 months later, the patient died of the recurrent disease. Although liposarcoma is a very common soft tissue sarcoma, it is rarely seen in the stomach. The standard therapy is surgical excision. Over the last years, adjuvant therapy became more accepted. Drugs of choice are doxorubicin and ifosfamide, although the benefits of this therapy are still largely unknown and doubtful.","title":"Giant liposarcoma of the stomach involving the mediastinum.","pubmedId":"17966553"}
