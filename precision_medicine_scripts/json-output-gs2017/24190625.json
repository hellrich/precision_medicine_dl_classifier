It is well known that one of the reasons of the neurological risk of embolization is due to dangerous anastomosis between the extracranial and the intracranial arteries. One of the most known and dangerous case of anastomosis is between the middle meningeal artery to the ophthalmic artery. A 48-year-old woman underwent preoperative embolization of a large right middle cranial fossa meningioma. The right external carotid angiogram showed that the tumor was fed by the right middle meningeal artery and there was no branch to the right orbital region. The right internal carotid angiogram showed that the right ophthalmic artery originated from the right internal carotid artery and there was no branch to the tumor. The selective angiogram of the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery disclosed the anastomosis to the right ophthalmic artery. Following embolization of the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery, the patient underwent embolization of the main feeding branch of the meningioma. She successfully underwent surgical removal of the tumor without any blood transfusion and was discharged without neurological deficit. In addition, to avoid complication in embolization of the feeding artery of a skull base meningioma, clinicians must be aware of the dangerous anastomosis between the middle meningeal artery and the ophthalmic artery, even if conventional external and internal carotid angiograms do not show any anastomosis.
