The study aimed to describe the occurrence, characteristics and prognosis of congestive heart failure in AMI and to compare post-MI patients with and without congestive heart failure. The methods used included baseline characteristics, initial symptoms, electrocardiogram (ECG), mortality during hospitalization and one year follow-up in consecutive patients with AMI admitted to Sahlgrenska Hospital, GÃ¶teborg, Sweden. Congestive heart failure was observed in 51% of the cases. Patients with congestive heart failure were older, more frequently had a history of previous cardiovascular disease, and, less frequently had chest pain on admission to hospital. They had a higher occurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during initial hospitalization, and their mortality during one year follow-up was 39% as compared to 17% in patients without congestive heart failure (P \u003c 0.001). This difference remained significant when correcting for differences at baseline. Patients with severe congestive heart failure had a one year mortality of 47% vs 31% in patients with moderate congestive heart failure (P \u003c 0.01). Signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure occur in every second patient admitted to hospital due to AMI, and indicate a bad prognosis, which is directly related to the severity of congestive heart failure.","title":"Characteristics and prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction in relation to occurrence of congestive heart failure.","pubmedId":"8088264"}
