The patient had a history of uterine leiomyosarcoma, for which she underwent a hysterectomy and oophorectomy 8 months ago. CT scan revealed a calcified mass that was located in the left cerebellar hemisphere which was resected. Histologically, multiple tissue fragments displayed infiltration of cerebellar tissue by polymorphic spindle-shaped cells. The Ki-67 proliferation index was approximately 20%. The morphological and immunohistochemical data, in association with the past clinical history, were consistent with cerebellar metastasis of uterine leiomyosarcoma. Although adjuvant radiotherapy was introduced, the patient died of cardiopulmonary arrest 6 weeks after the surgical procedure. The present case adds to the body of literature being the second report of uterine leiomyosarcoma metastatic to the cerebellum.","title":"A 57-year-old female with a cerebellar mass.","pubmedId":"21492295"}
