Point mutations of c-K-ras in codon 12 were detected by RNA-DNA RNAse A mismatch cleavage after in vitro DNA amplification of the cellular c-K-ras sequences by the polymerase chain reaction. Of the 36 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, mutant c-K-ras oncogenes were detected in 18 of 25 (72%) with malignant cytologies, 2 of 8 (25%) with atypical cytologies, and 0 of 3 with benign aspiration cytologies. The remaining 11 patients without pancreatic adenocarcinomas did not have mutant c-K-ras genes detectable by the assay. The diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma was based upon clinical follow-up. The presence of mutant c-K-ras oncogenes did not significantly affect survival in the patients studied. Mutant c-K-ras genes were found at the time of initial clinical presentation in the majority of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, suggesting an important role of the mutation in oncogenesis. In conjunction with cytology, our approach represents an application for cancer diagnosis at the molecular genetic level.","title":"Detection of c-K-ras mutations in fine needle aspirates from human pancreatic adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"2404591"}
