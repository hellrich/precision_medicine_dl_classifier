Generally, inhibitors mimics ATP structure and block the binding between ATP and FGFR kinase. Here, two novel, non-ATP-competitive, selective, irreversible FGFR1 inhibitors, A114 and A117, were identified via kinase inhibitory assay from 156 synthetic bisaryl-1,4-dien-3-one derivatives. A \"DFG-OUT\" inactive conformation binding mode with FGFR1 was predicted by molecular docking. A114 and A117 showed significant anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo via targeting FGFR1.","title":"Discovery and identification of new non-ATP competitive FGFR1 inhibitors with therapeutic potential on non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24513267"}
