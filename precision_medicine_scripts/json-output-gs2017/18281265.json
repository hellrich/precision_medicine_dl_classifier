Chronomodulation might reduce toxicity and improve efficacy.\nA phase II study examining chronomodulated XELOX(30) (XELOX(30chron)): oxaliplatin: 130 mg/m(2) on day 1, as a 30-min infusion between 1 and 3 p.m. Capecitabine: total daily dose of 2000 mg/m(2), 20% of the dose between 7 and 9 a.m. and 80% of the dose between 6 and 8 p.m. in patients with mCRC resistant to irinotecan. Seventy-one patients were enrolled. Response rate was 18%; median progression-free survival 5.1 months and median overall survival (OS) 10.2 months. Platelet count and performance status were significantly correlated to OS in multivariate analyses. Neurotoxicity grade 2 and 3 was seen in 25% and 2% of patients, respectively, other grade 3 toxic effects were as follows: nausea 6%, vomiting 3%, diarrhoea 12% (3% experienced grade 4) and palmoplantart erytem 9%.\nXELOX(30chron) is a convenient second-line regimen with efficacy and safety profile similar to other oxaliplatin schedules. To further investigate chronomodulated XELOX, we have started a Nordic randomised phase II study comparing XELOX(30) and XELOX(30chron) as first-line therapy in patients with mCRC.","title":"Chronomodulated capecitabine in combination with short-time oxaliplatin: a Nordic phase II study of second-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer after failure to irinotecan and 5-flourouracil.","pubmedId":"18281265"}
