However, among independently ascertained families with the same mutation, cases of male breast cancer often appear to cluster in a single family or in a particular branch of one family. This suggests that the risk of male breast cancer conferred by BRCA2 mutations may be modified by other genetic or environmental factors. We report a family in which three brothers with breast cancer carry in their germ line two genetic abnormalities: an insertion A at nucleotide 2041 in exon 10 of BRCA2, which leads to premature termination of the encoded protein at codon 615, and a tandem interstitial duplication involving chromosome bands 9p23-24. We propose that the coexistence of this rare chromosomal abnormality with BRCA2 mutation may be augmenting the risk of male breast cancer conferred by the BRCA2 mutation.","title":"An interstitial tandem duplication of 9p23-24 coexists with a mutation in the BRCA2 gene in the germ line of three brothers with breast cancer.","pubmedId":"9500439"}
