The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) governs a key cell-cycle checkpoint that normally prevents G1-phase cells from entering S-phase in the absence of appropriate mitogenic signals. Cancer cells frequently overcome pRb-dependent growth suppression via constitutive phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb function by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 or CDK6 partnered with D-type cyclins. Three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer), ribociclib (Novartis), and abemaciclib (Lilly), are in various stages of development in a variety of pRb-positive tumor types, including breast cancer, melanoma, liposarcoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. The emerging, positive clinical data obtained to date finally validate the two decades-old hypothesis that the cyclin D-CDK4/6 pathway is a rational target for cancer therapy.","title":"Molecular Pathways: Targeting the Cyclin D-CDK4/6 Axis for Cancer Treatment.","pubmedId":"25941111"}
