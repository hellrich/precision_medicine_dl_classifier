Trastuzumab exhibited efficacy and safety for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, in single usage or in combination with paclitaxel, docetaxel or vinorelbine. Trastuzumab is also useful in an adjuvant setting in HER2-positive early breast cancer. However, it is not clear whether concurrent or sequential treatment is superior. Lapatinib combined with capecitabine showed efficacy against HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. It was suggested that the combination with lapatinib and paclitaxel was effective. Bevacizumab combined with paclitaxel revealed efficacy for metastatic breast cancer. These molecular-targeted agents play an important role in treatment of breast cancer.","title":"[Combined chemotherapy with molecular-targeted agent for breast cancer].","pubmedId":"18487908"}
