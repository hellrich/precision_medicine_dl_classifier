We report a case revealed by a fever in a 24-year-old woman. The tumor measured 9 cm and extended into the lower right bronchus. The diagnosis was done on a biopsy performed during fiberoptic endoscopy. The patient was treated by lobectomy. She is well without disease 6 years after surgery. This type of predominantly epithelial tumor with neuroendocrine differentiation and a scanty non malignant stromal component should be identified in young women because of its favorable outcome after surgical resection. It must not be confused with ordinary adenocarcinoma nor metastatic adenocarcinoma, especially endometrioid type.","title":"[Pulmonary endodermal tumor resembling fetal lung.
