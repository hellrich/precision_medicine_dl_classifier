A 12 year-old male, with sickle cell disease, presented with 72 hrs of painful erection. The patient failed conservative measures including aspiration, injection of phenylephrine, as well as distal shunt procedure. A T-T shunt was performed, as previously described in the adult literature. There was immediate resolution of the erection with no complications. At 1 year follow-up, he reports no subsequent episodes of priapism and normal erections. T shunt with tunneling can be performed in select cases of severe pediatric refractory ischemic priapism.","title":"T-Shaped Shunt with Intracavernosal Tunneling, for a Pediatric Case of Refractory Ischemic Priapism.","pubmedId":"27693479"}
