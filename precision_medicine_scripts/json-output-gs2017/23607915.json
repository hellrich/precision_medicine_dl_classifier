The goal of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome and prognostic factors in patients after resection for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head.\nThe data from 195 patients who underwent pancreatic head resection for PDAC between 1993 and 2011 in our center were retrospectively analyzed. The prognostic factors for survival after operation were evaluated using multivariate analysis.\nThe head resection surgeries included 69.7% pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomies (PPPD) and 30.3% standard Kausch-Whipple pancreatoduodenectomies (Whipple). The overall mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) was 4.1%, and the overall morbidity was 42%. The actuarial 3- and 5-year survival rates were 31.5% (95% CI, 25.04%-39.6%) and 11.86% (95% CI, 7.38%-19.0%), respectively. Univariate analyses demonstrated that elevated CEA (p \u003d 0.002) and elevated CA 19-9 (p \u003d 0.026) levels, tumor grade (p \u003d 0.001) and hard texture of the pancreatic gland (p \u003d 0.017) were significant predictors of a poor survival. However, only CEA \u003e3 ng/ml (p \u003c 0.005) and tumor grade 3 (p \u003d 0.027) were validated as significant predictors of survival in multivariate analysis.\nOur results suggest that tumor marker levels and tumor grade are significant predictors of poor survival for patients with pancreatic head cancer. Furthermore, hard texture of the pancreatic gland appears to be associated with poor survival.","title":"Evaluation of survival in patients after pancreatic head resection for ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23607915"}
