At present, surgical resection offers the best chance of cure. However, most of pancreatic cancers are already unresectable at initial diagnosis. Thus, the majority of patients depend on chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or supportive care. We investigated the effect of treatment modalities on the survival in pancreatic cancer.\nBetween September 1994 and May 2003, one hundred and fifty four patients with pancreatic cancer were treated by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or conservative management. The clinical datas were analyzed retrospectively for survival according to stage and treatment modality.\nOverall median survival time was 5.7 months and 1 year survival rate was 18.3%. In patients with stage I to III disease, the median survival time was 13.9 months in surgery group, 10.2 months in radiation group, and 6.1 months in supportive care group (p%lt;0.01). Survival rate according to treatment modality was significantly different among groups. In patients with stage IV disease, the median survival time was 6.1 months in radiation therapy group, 7.1 months in chemotherapy group, and 2.7 months in supportive care group. Overall survival was significantly higher in treatment groups than in supportive care group (p\u003c0.01), but there was no difference in survival between chemotherapy group and radiotherapy group.\nIn patients with stage I to III pancreatic cancer, surgery can improve median survival. In patients with stage IV, either chemotherapy or radiotherapy can prolong survival compared to supportive care. These results suggest that more active treatment of pancreatic cancer even in advanced stage will be needed to prolong the survival.","title":"[Survival analysis according to treatment modality in pancreatic cancer patient].","pubmedId":"16118522"}
