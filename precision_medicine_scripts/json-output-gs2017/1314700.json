The DCC gene located on chromosome 18q21.3 codes for a potential tumor suppressor gene related to cellular adhesion receptors. We investigated the expression of this gene in several pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and in patients with ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. In 8 of 11 cell lines and in 4 of 8 primary tumors a complete extinction of DCC gene expression was observed, whereas the c-Ki-ras gene was mutated at codon 12 in 7 of 8 tumors. A highly reduced or absent expression of DCC was found in all low or undifferentiated pancreatic tumor cell lines, whereas in the more differentiated ones DCC expression was conserved. These data suggest that loss of DCC gene expression is an important factor in the development or progress of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and may be linked to the differentiated phenotype of the pancreatic tumor cell.","title":"Frequent loss of expression of the potential tumor suppressor gene DCC in ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"1314700"}
