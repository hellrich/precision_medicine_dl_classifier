After the specificity of each anti-ras monoclonal antibody was confirmed by protein immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemical assays for a common-ras antigen present in N-, Harvey- and Kirsten (K)-ras oncoproteins, as well as for K-ras specific antigen, were performed on paraffin-embedded carcinoma tissue from 110 patients who underwent curative resection. By Western blot analysis, there was more p21 in fresh cancer specimens than in normal specimens. K-ras expression distinguished advanced from early gastric carcinoma and correlated with depth of cancer invasion. Among the 110 patients, survival rates of those with carcinomas positive for the common-ras or K-ras antigens were significantly lower than of those with antigen-negative carcinomas (p \u003c 0.05). In a multivariate analysis, nodal involvement (p \u003d 0.002), serosal invasion (p \u003d 0.012) and K-ras p21 expression (p \u003d 0.044) were independently predictive of the recurrence. These results suggest that K-ras p21 is a useful marker of tumor progression and poor prognosis after curative resection.","title":"Expression of Kirsten-ras p21 in gastric cancer correlates with tumor progression and is prognostic.","pubmedId":"7981894"}
