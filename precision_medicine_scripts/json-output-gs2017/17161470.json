Computed tomography demonstrated a small amount of air at the distal end of the laryngeal stump and significant esophageal air. Aerophagia was diagnosed with air presumed diverted through the laryngeal stump due to cricopharyngeal hypertension. Cricopharyngeal botulinum toxin injection was coordinated with a minimal neck dissection to drain the subcutaneous emphysema. The subcutaneous emphysema gradually improved and the patient was discharged home. His subcutaneous emphysema has not returned after four total botulinum toxin injections every 3 months.","title":"Botulinum toxin as treatment for a unique case of subcutaneous emphysema.","pubmedId":"17161470"}
