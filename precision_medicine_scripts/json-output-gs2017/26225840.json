Recognized histological subtypes include well differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DDLS), myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Currently, there are no proper subtype-specific treatments due to the genetic, histological and clinical heterogeneity of the liposarcoma subentities. In the past decade, the rising understanding of the various genetic and molecular aberrations in liposarcoma led to the development of novel alternative therapeutic strategies. One such therapy is the inhibition of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) which is overexpressed in liposarcomas. In this study, we dissect the functional role of a novel potent Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 (AUY922) in different cell lines of myxoid (MLS402, MLS1765) and undifferentiated (SW872) liposarcomas. We show that compared with 17-AAG treatment, lower concentrations of AUY922 achieve markedly cytotoxic effects on tumor cell viability. Combination treatment of AUY922 (20 nM) with Doxorubicin (300 nM) yielded a further reduction in cell viability in comparison to Doxorubicin alone. In vivo, we document an inhibition of tumor growth after AUY922 treatment. Further analyses revealed that Hsp90-inhibition induces apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest. In addition, we report striking perturbations of subtype-specific pattern in Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K signaling after AUY922 application. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that Hsp90-inhibition by AUY922 may be a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for myxoid liposarcoma patients.
