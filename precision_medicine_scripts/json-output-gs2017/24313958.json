One of the most frequent side-effects associated with its use as a single agent is the development of acneiform eruptions. These eruptions seem to be reduced when dosed in combination with dabrafenib.\nTo investigate the prevalence of acneiform eruptions in patients taking the MEK inhibitor trametinib, both alone and in combination with dabrafenib.\nAll patients enrolled in the trametinib alone (n \u003d 13) or trametinib and dabrafenib combination (n \u003d 30) clinical trials at a single site underwent a retrospective file review. The development and management of acne or acneiform eruptions was noted.\nIn total, 77% of the trametinib group developed an acneiform eruption on the trial, while only 10% developed acneiform lesions in the combination trial. The patients were treated with oral doxycycline, topical antibiotics or topical antiseptic washes, with a good response. However the condition recurred if these treatments were ceased and the patient was still on trametinib therapy.\nThe MEK inhibitor trametinib is associated with the development of acneiform eruptions. When combined with dabrafenib the frequency of this side-effect is reduced.","title":"Acneiform eruptions: a common cutaneous toxicity of the MEK inhibitor trametinib.","pubmedId":"24313958"}
