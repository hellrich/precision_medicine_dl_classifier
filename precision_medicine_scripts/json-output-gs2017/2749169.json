Regardless of type, there were 10.3% of hypercalcaemic patients in the whole population. Hypercalcaemia was found most frequently in epidermoid carcinoma (10.98%), followed by adenocarcinoma (10.51%), small cell carcinoma (10.11%) and undifferentiated carcinoma (9.72%). In the group of 19 large cell carcinomas the hypercalcaemia was not established. Except large cell carcinoma, the differences among the groups were not statistically significant.","title":"[Hypercalcemia in bronchogenic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"2749169"}
