Her past medical history included right mastectomy for breast cancer at age 53 and distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer at age 70. She underwent a left hemicolectomy for descending colon adenocarcinoma in April 2011. Four months after that operation, 3 enlarging nodules in the left lung and a swollen left axillary lymph node were detected by computed tomography. No tumor was detected in the left breast by ultrasonography and mammography. The lung tumors were resected thoracoscopically, and the left axillary lymph node was excised. These specimens were histologically diagnosed as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, which had metastasized from colon cancer, not from the previous breast or gastric cancer. She received adjuvant chemotherapy with uracil and tegafur (UFT) plus Leucovorin for 6 months and is still alive after 12 months without recurrence.","title":"[A case report of surgical treatment for axillary lymph node metastasis from descending colon cancer].","pubmedId":"23268040"}
