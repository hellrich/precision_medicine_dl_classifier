The p16 mRNA and protein expression of A549-p16 and H460-p16 cell was detected by Northern blots and immunocytochemistry, respectively. The cell growth properties and cell cycle pattern were aassessed by flow cytometry.\nThe growth and colony forming efficiency of A549-p16 and H460-p16 cells were significantly inhibited compared with the controls. Flow cytometry showed A549-p16 and H460-p16 cells were arrested in G1 phase of cell cycle, and the percentage of cells in S phase and G2/M phase was decreased significantly. Tumorigenicity of the A549-p16 and H460-p16 cells in nude mice was greatly inhibited.\nThe results show that human p16 gene can suppress the malignant phenotype of wild-type p53 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 and H460). p16 gene can play a role in the gene therapy of human lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"[Effect of exogenous p16 gene on the growth of wild-type p53 human lung adenocarcinoma cells].","pubmedId":"11776846"}
