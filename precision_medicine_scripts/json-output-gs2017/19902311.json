The clinicopathological factors affecting survival were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses with regard to the surgical procedures and surgical margins.\nThe surgical procedure included extrahepatic bile duct resection alone (EHBD; n \u003d 17), major hepatectomy combined with extrahepatic bile duct resection (MHx; n \u003d 26), pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD; n \u003d 28), and MHx and concomitant PD (HPD; n \u003d 6). Performance of MHx and/or PD in addition to EHBD increased surgical morbidity (p \u003d 0.001). Among patients undergoing the four surgical procedures (EHBD, MHx, PD, and HPD), no significant difference was found in the incidence of positive overall surgical margins (53%, 65%, 46%, and 67%, p \u003d 0.51) or long-term survivals (median survival time, 51, 27, 41, and 22 months, p \u003d 0.60). A multivariate analysis revealed that perineural invasion (95% confidence interval, 1.1-12.3, p \u003d 0.009), nodal metastasis (1.6-6.8, p \u003d 0.001), and blood transfusion (1.1-3.9, p \u003d 0.02) were independent predictors of a poor outcome. Perineural invasion was associated with positive radial margins (p \u003d 0.045) and submucosal ductal infiltration (p \u003d 0.03).\nPerineural invasion, rather than the type of surgical procedure, had a significant impact on surgical curability and survival of patients with infrahilar/suprapancreatic cholangiocarcinoma treated according to our intention-to-treat strategy.","title":"Surgical management of infrahilar/suprapancreatic cholangiocarcinoma: an analysis of the surgical procedures, surgical margins, and survivals of 77 patients.","pubmedId":"19902311"}
