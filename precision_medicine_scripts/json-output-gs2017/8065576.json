Our aim was to clarify whether the pathological dural contrast enhancement adjacent to meningiomas (the \"dural tail\") is specific to meningiomas and, more important, whether it represents neoplastic dural infiltration or hypervascularization as a tumor accompanying reaction. A \"dural tail\" was found in 9 of 17 meningiomas. None of the other extra-axial tumours (neuromas, pituitary adenomas) showed comparable dural enhancement. Dynamic examinations with an ultrafast single slice imaging technique (snapshot-FLASH) after a bolus injection of contrast medium showed a \"dural tail\" in seven out of these nine meningiomas, while in two cases the \"dural tail\" turned out to be a cortical vein with a characteristic dynamic contrast enhancement pattern. In the dynamic study all seven \"dural tails\" were found to have earlier, steeper contrast enhancement than the corresponding tumours. All the tumours and part of the adjacent dura mater in four of the seven meningiomas with dural enhancement were examined histopathologically. In none of these four cases was neoplastic tissue found more than 2 mm away from the main tumour. The results strongly support the suggestion that the \"dural tail\" adjacent to meningiomas represents a hypervascular, non-neoplastic dural reaction.","title":"The \"dural tail\" adjacent to meningiomas studied by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: a comparison with histopathology.","pubmedId":"8065576"}
