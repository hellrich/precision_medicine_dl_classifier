Temporal trend in the incidence of CRC was analyzed by using Annual Percent Change (APC) model. Kaplan-Meier analysis with Log-rank testing was employed to estimate the survival. Incidence and mortality rates were standardized on age composition of standard population from 2000 nationwide census.\nA total of 5 881 CRC cases were diagnosed from 2002 to 2012 with crude incidence as 50.60/10(5) and standardized one as 31.21/10(5). The crude incidence rates of colon cancer and rectal cancer were 31.09/10(5) and 18.27/10(5), respectively and the standardized rates were 14.49/10(5) and 8.83/10(5), respectively. The incidence rates of colon cancer were not significantly different between different gender. However, the incidence of rectal cancer in males was significantly higher than in females (P \u003c 0.001). The incidence rates of CRC significantly increased in the age group older than 50 years. However, the standardized incidence rate did not change significantly(APC \u003d 0.39). A total of 3 735 cases died of CRC in this period. The annual crude mortality of CRC was 31.35/10(5) with the standardized rate as 13.72/10(5). The mortality kept increasing significantly in the population older than 60 years. Mortality of rectal cancer was significantly higher in males than in females (P \u003c 0.001). The 5-year survival rates in both colon cancer and rectal cancer patients were 48.88% and 54.16%, respectively. Survivals were significantly higher in those who had received surgical treatments than in those without surgical treatments (colon cancer: 58.10% vs. 37.22%, P \u003c 0.001; rectal cancer:66.18% vs. 39.37%, P \u003c 0.001).\nAge seemed to have contributed to an increased morbidity and mortality of CRC in Yangpu district of Shanghai. The mortality of CRC appeared higher than the incidence. Surgical treatment could significantly prolong the survival of CRC patients.","title":"[Incidence and survival of colorectal carcinoma among permanent residents in Yangpu district of Shanghai, from 2002 to 2012].","pubmedId":"24831629"}
