The low 5-year survival rate of the highly aggressive LNETs (SCLC and LCNEC) combined with the lack of an effective treatment, suggest that understanding how these tumors arise and identifying therapeutic targets are unmet needs. We performed genome/exome, and transcriptome sequencing of 29 SCLC (Ref.1), 60 LCNEC, and 45 PCA to better understand their molecular origin and identify altered genes that may offer therapeutic opportunities.In contrast to SCLC and LCNEC, we found that RB1 and TP53 mutations were rare events in PCA suggesting that PCA are not early progenitor lesions of SCLC or LCNEC, but arise through independent mechanisms. Moreover, GSEA analysis showed that genes of the RB1 pathway were downregulated in SCLC but not in PCA. Our data also show that inactivation of chromatin-remodeling genes, specifically genes involved in histone methylation and subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, is sufficient to drive transformation in PCA.In a preliminary analysis of 15 LCNEC (Ref.2) we observed a predominance of mutations typical of SCLC, such as RB1, TP53, and CREBBP/EP300. In this larger series, we additionally found samples with mutations frequent in adenocarcinoma (AD) or squamous (SQ) lung cancer. We could then distinguish two well-defined groups of LCNEC: a SCLC-like group, carrying MYCL1 amplifications and mutations in both RB1 and TP53 genes; and an AD/SQ-like group, harbouring CDKN2A deletions, TTF1 amplifications, and frequent mutations in KEAP1 and STK11. Interestingly, RB1, STK11, and KEAP1 mutations happened in an almost mutually exclusive way. These data suggest that LCNEC might represent an evolutionary trunk that can branch to SCLC or AD/SQ, and also that LNETs and non-LNETs are not completely different entities. This is already suggested by the fact that one of the resistance mechanisms of EGFR-mutant adenocarcinomas to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors is through trans-differentiation to SCLC (Ref.3).Finally, we also identified new targetable driver genes in SCLC and LCNEC: FGFR1 amplifications were observed in 6% and 18% of the cases respectively; PTEN mutations were identified in 10% of the SCLC cases; and interestingly, one of the LCNEC samples (belonging to the SCLC-like group) harboured an activating RFWD2-NTRK1 fusion gene suggesting that fusions affecting NTRK1 may not only be a targetable opportunity for AD (Ref.4) but also for LCNEC and, based on the molecular similarities, also SCLC.(1) Peifer and Fernandez-Cuesta et al.
