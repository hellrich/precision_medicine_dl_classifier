This guideline (GL) is the first one published by an academic society in Japan. Presently in Japan, many people have depressive symptoms, and the socioeconomic loss (suicide, absence from work, etc.) induced by this condition cannot be overlooked. Although the Japanese society, including mass media and psychiatrists, has attempted to solve this public problem, a solution has not been found. JSMD regarded diagnosis and psychiatric management of depression, among other factors, as the key to solving this problem. For example, patients who meet the DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) criteria still have numerous subtypes, and they often have other psychiatric comorbidities that a diagnosis of MDD alone cannot detect. Although the process for differential diagnosis and treatment planning is indispensable, its methodology has not been necessarily shared even among psychiatrists until today. In this GL, considering the research evidence and its limitations, JSMD suggests necessary steps for appropriate information intake, diagnosis, therapeutic alliance formation, psychoeducation, and treatment modality choice in every phase (acute and continuation/maintenance). This GL also considers pharmaco-, psycho-, and electroconvulsive therapy for major depressive subtypes (mild, moderate/severe, and psychotic). Simultaneously, psychiatrists are required to be alert to the risk from diffuse and multiple prescription of benzodiazepine receptor agonists (dependence, deterioration of sleep apnea, cognitive decline, paradoxical reaction, etc.), especially barbiturates. This GL will be revised on the basis of public comments, including criticism. In the future, treatment GLs for comorbid patients, return-to-work cases, primary care physicians, psychiatric residents, and patients with depressions other than MDD (subthreshold depression, dysthymic disorder, and adaptation disorder) may be needed.","title":"[Review of the new treatment guideline for major depressive disorder by the Japanese Society of Mood Disorders].","pubmedId":"23037606"}
