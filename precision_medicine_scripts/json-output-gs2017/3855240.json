DNA fragments containing coding lesions have been cloned, and nucleotide sequence analysis suggests that the T3M-4 oncogene has been activated by a single nucleotide transition from A to C in the second exon, which results in the substitution of histidine for glutamine in coden 61 of the predicted amino acid sequence. The quantity analysis of c-K-ras oncogene in the DNA and RNA of T3M-4 cells revealed that the c-K-ras gene was amplified and overexpressed in T3M-4 cells. These findings indicate that the T3M-4 c-K-ras oncogene is activated by different mutational events.","title":"Activation of the c-K-ras oncogene in a human pancreas carcinoma.","pubmedId":"3855240"}
