The outcome of patients with skin metastasis is usually poor as they are often associated with locoregional recurrence. This metastasis impairs the quality of life and shortens survival. Consequently, physicians should be aware of the possible existence of skin metastasis in cervical cancer. Clinical suspicion should lead to a careful additional evaluation whenever a cutaneous nodule presents in the course of the disease.\nWe report a rare case of metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of cervix to the umbilicus. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIB FIGO. Four months after chemoradiation patient presented with a nodule in the umbilical region. Biopsy performed and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed. Patient underwent salvage therapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is a rare reported occurrence of umbilical metastasis in cervical cancer without prior laparotomy or laparoscopy. This metastatic lesion has a grave prognosis and the mean survival is about 3 months like our case.","title":"Umblical metastasis in cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"18379810"}
