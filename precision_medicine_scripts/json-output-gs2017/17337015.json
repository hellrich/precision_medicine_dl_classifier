Recurrence is not uncommon. The aim of our study is to present the clinical and pathological characteristics of this entity and a review of the literature. We report two cases of chordoid meningioma occurring in two women aged 47 and 63 years. Both women presented neurological signs without systemic disease. Radiological findings were temporoparietal and temporofrontal lesions with intense enhancement after contrast injection. Complete surgical resection was performed. Histopathologic findings were consistent with chordoid meningioma.","title":"[Chordoid meningioma. Two cases].","pubmedId":"17337015"}
