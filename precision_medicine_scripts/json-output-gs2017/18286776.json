The expression of ER and PR were significantly correlated (p \u003c 0.001). and had a significant negative correlation with Her/2neu amplification (p0.003 each). Lower grade of the tumour was significantly related to the expression of ER (p0.000) and PR (p0.000) but not to Her/2neu amplification (p0.331). Age at diagnosis was significantly correlated to the expression of ER (p0.004), but not to PR (p0.365) or Her/2neu amplification (p0.456).\nPrevalence or ER, PR and Her/2neu amplification in carcinoma of breast among Sri Lankans is similar to that described internationally. The correlations of ER, PR, Her/2neu amplification, to each other, age at diagnosis and grade of tumour is as reported in other countries.","title":"Hormone receptor expression and Her/2neu amplification in breast carcinoma in a cohort of Sri Lankans.","pubmedId":"18286776"}
