We have previously shown that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in triple negative breast cancer cells is regulated, at least in part, by SAF-1 (serum amyloid A activating factor 1) transcription factor. In this study we show that transformation of normal MCF-10A breast epithelial cells by constitutively active, oncogenic Ras, induces the DNA-binding activity and transcription function of SAF-1. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of MEK/MAPK-signaling pathway prevents Ras-mediated activation of SAF-1. Interestingly, silencing of SAF-1 expression in breast cancer cells by SAF-1-specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) significantly reduced H-Ras and K-Ras mRNA level. We show that SAF-1 is a direct transcriptional regulator of H-Ras and K-Ras and overexpression of SAF-1 increases H-Ras and K-Ras gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses demonstrated in vivo interaction of SAF-1 at highly purine-rich sequences present at the proximal promoter region, upstream of the transcription start site, in H-Ras and K-Ras genes. Previous studies have shown that these sequences are nuclease hypersensitive and capable of forming G4 quadruplex structure. Together, our results show the presence of a novel transactivating loop, in which, Ras and SAF-1 are interconnected. These findings will help defining molecular mechanisms of abnormal overexpression of Ras in breast tumors, which seldom show genetic Ras mutations.
