A large body of literature concerning therapy-related acute and late morbidity is available. Chemoradiation-associated necrosis of the uterus has not been described so far.\nTwo patients are reported who were treated by combined chemoradiation between 2004 and 2005 for histologically confirmed cervical cancer following laparoscopic staging. Both patients were diagnosed with squamous cell cancer of the cervix FIGO stage IIB (T2b pN1 pM1 LYM G2) and FIGO IIIA (T3a pN1 M0 G2), respectively. External-beam radiotherapy was applied in a 3-D-planned four-field technique, covering pelvic lymph nodes and primary tumor. Patient #1 received additional paraaortic irradiation. Patient #2 underwent 5 x 5 Gy brachytherapy covering the tumor. Simultaneously, cisplatin was given to both patients. Following chemoradiation, both patients developed pelvic pain and an elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the presence of a normal leukocyte count. Both patients underwent relaparoscopy, and necrosis of the uterus combined with partial necrosis of the bladder was diagnosed in patient #1. Patient #1 underwent total supralevatoric exenteration and patient #2 laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\nIn patients with persisting or incident pelvic pain, questionable findings in imaging techniques and/or elevated inflammation parameters following completion of chemoradiation for cervical cancer, differential diagnosis should include radiogenic necrosis of the uterus and other pelvic organs. Laparoscopy is an ideal technique to exclude or confirm this diagnosis.","title":"Uterus necrosis after radiochemotherapy in two patients with advanced cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"16404520"}
