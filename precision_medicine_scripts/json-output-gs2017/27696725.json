Previously, the reversible pan-kinase inhibitor Staurosporine has been found to selectively inhibit the HER2 T798M mutant over wild-type kinase, suggesting that the Staurosporine scaffold is potentially to develop mutant-selective inhibitors. Here, we systematically evaluated the chemical space of Staurosporine scaffold-based compounds in response to HER2 T798M mutation at structural, energetic and molecular levels by using an integrated analysis strategy. With the strategy we were able to identify several novel wild-type sparing inhibitors with high or moderate selectivity, which are comparable to or even better than that of the parent compound Staurosporine. Molecular modeling and structural analysis revealed that noncovalent contacts can form between the side chain of mutated residue Met798 and selective inhibitor ligands, which may improve the favorable interaction energy between the kinase and inhibitor and reduce the unfavorable desolvation penalty upon the kinase-inhibitor binding.
