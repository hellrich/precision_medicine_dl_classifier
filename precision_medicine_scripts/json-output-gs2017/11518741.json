The choice of a chemotherapeutic regimen depends on differences in time to progression, response rate, toxicity profile, cost and symptom relief. Several other strategies, such as three-drug combinations, sequential use of a third drug, weekly administration, etc., have been evaluated to improve the chemotherapeutic effect. The sequencing of the human genome may permit targeting of specific abnormalities related to each lung cancer with target-based drugs. This should increase the possibility of application of individualized therapy and, we would hope, improve survival.","title":"Recent advances in the chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"11518741"}
