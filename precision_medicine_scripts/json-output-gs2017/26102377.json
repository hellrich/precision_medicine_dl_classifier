Chi-square tests, multiple logistic regression analysis, and ROC analysis were performed.\nThe most common imaging features of autoimmune pancreatitis were sausage shape (25/39 [64%]) and low-attenuation halo (23/39 [59%]). Pancreatic duct dilatation (20/25 [80%]) and biliary dilatation (11/25 [44%]) were most frequent in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Peripancreatic stranding (22/27 [81%]) was most frequent in acute interstitial pancreatitis. Sausage shape, low-attenuation halo, and absence of a pancreatic duct or biliary dilatation differentiated autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with an accuracy of 0.88. Sausage shape and absence of peripancreatic stranding differentiated autoimmune pancreatitis from acute interstitial pancreatitis with an accuracy of 0.82. There was no significant difference in the frequency of vascular involvement or of lymphadenopathy among these diagnoses.\nTypical cases of autoimmune pancreatitis can be accurately differentiated from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and acute interstitial pancreatitis on the basis of characteristic MDCT features. However, autoimmune pancreatitis should be considered in the presence of atypical features.","title":"Use of MDCT to Differentiate Autoimmune Pancreatitis From Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Interstitial Pancreatitis.","pubmedId":"26102377"}
