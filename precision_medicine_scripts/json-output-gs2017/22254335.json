For these patients, the radial stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), planned and delivered with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques, offers the only curative option. However, IMRT-SBRT has three significant deficiencies: an elevated beam-on time (MU); a reduced MU-to-cGy coefficient; and a prolonged delivery time. To address these issues, we have developed our in-house version of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). In this preliminary study, we compared VMAT-SBRT with IMRT-SBRT in terms of optimization, dosimetry, and delivery. Our goal was to investigate the feasibility of replacing the exiting IMRT-SBRT with VMAT-SBRT as a safe and viable alternative radiation modality for early-stage NSCLC.","title":"Feasibility of implementing stereotactic body radiation therapy using a non-commercial volumetric modulated arc therapy treatment planning system for early stage lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22254335"}
