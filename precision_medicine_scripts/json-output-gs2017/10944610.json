In the present study, we investigated the role of met expression on the modulation of apoptosis in colorectal tumours. The gene expressions of c-met and the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family, including bcl-2, bcl-x(L)and bcl-w, were analysed in human colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas by using a quantitative polymerase chain-reaction combined with reverse transcription. In seven of 12 adenomas and seven of 11 carcinomas, the c-met gene was overexpressed. The bcl-w, bcl-2 and bcl-x(L)genes were over-expressed in nine, five and six of 12 adenomas and in five, two and seven of 11 carcinomas, respectively. The c-met mRNA level in human colorectal adenomas and carcinomas was correlated with bcl-w but not with bcl-2 or with bcl-x(L)mRNA level. The administration of c-met-antisense oligonucleotides decreased Met protein levels in the LoVo human colon cancer cell line. In the case of c- met -antisense-treated cells, apoptotic cell death induced by serum deprivation was more prominent, compared to control or c-met -nonsense-treated cells. Treatment with c-met-antisense oligonucleotides inhibits the gene expression of bcl-w in LoVo cells. On the other hand, the gene expression of bcl-2 or bcl-x(L)was not affected by treatment with c-met-antisense oligonucleotides. These findings suggest that Met expression modulates apoptosis through bcl -w expression in colorectal tumours.","title":"Met/HGF receptor modulates bcl-w expression and inhibits apoptosis in human colorectal cancers.","pubmedId":"10944610"}
