This study sought to describe the mutational profile of SC using high-throughput genotyping technology.\nWe used mass spectrometry to test 114 surgical biopsies from 81 patients with SC for 214 mutations affecting 26 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.\nIn total, 75 (92.6%) patients were smokers. Within the total 81 tumors, 67 distinct somatic alterations were identified, with 56 tumors (69.1%) harboring at least one mutation. The most frequent mutations were KRAS (27.2%), EGFR (22.2%), TP53 (22.2%), STK11 (7.4%), NOTCH1 (4.9%), NRAS (4.9%), and PI3KCA (4.9%). The EGFR mutations were almost always rare mutations (89%). In 32 tumors (39.5%), two or more mutations co-existed, with up to four mutations in a single case. In six different cases, comparative genetic analysis of different histological areas from the same tumor (giant, spindle, or epithelial component) revealed a 61% concordance rate for all the mutations with a 10% detection threshold, compared with 91.7% with a 20% detection threshold.\nOur results demonstrated a high mutation rate and frequent co-mutations. Despite SC tumors exhibiting a high histological heterogeneity, some intratumoral molecular homogeneity was found. Now with newly developed targeted therapies, SC patients may be eligible for new target mutations, and can now therefore be screened for clinical trials.","title":"High-throughput somatic mutation profiling in pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas using the LungCartaâ„¢ Panel: exploring therapeutic targets.","pubmedId":"25969368"}
