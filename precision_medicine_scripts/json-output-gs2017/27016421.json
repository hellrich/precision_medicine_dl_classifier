PIK3CA mutations and gene copy number amplifications were analyzed by pyrosequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\nNine of the 105 liposarcomas (8.6%) had activating PIK3CA mutation. PIK3CA mutations were more frequent in myxoid/round cell and pleomorphic tumors compared with well-differentiated/dedifferentiated tumors (13.3% vs. 2.2%, P\u003d0.043). In FISH PIK3CA analysis, copy number gain was detected in 14 of the 101 tumors (13.9%): 11 (10.9%) tumors had increased gene copy number (polysomy) and 3 (3.0%) exhibited gene amplification. In survival analysis, patients with PIK3CA copy number gain had a worse prognosis compared to patients without PIK3CA amplification (median disease-free survival [DFS] 22.2 vs. 107.6 months p\u003d0.005). By multivariate analysis, PIK3CA copy number gain was an independent prognostic factor for worse DFS (P\u003d0.027; hazard ratio, 2.400; 95% confidence interval 1.105 to 5.213). PIK3CA mutation was not associated with DFS and overall survival.\nWe demonstrated PIK3CA mutation and amplification in liposarcoma. PIK3CA copy number gain was an independent poor prognostic factor for DFS. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential diagnostic and therapeutic role of PIK3CA mutations and amplifications in liposarcoma.","title":"Prognostic implications of PIK3CA amplification in curatively resected liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"27016421"}
