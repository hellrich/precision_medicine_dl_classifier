Endoscopy showed a polypoid mass at the ampulla of Vater. Endoscopic biopsy showed villous adenoma with moderate cellular atypia. Wide excision of the tumor was performed. After resection, histological examination confirmed the tumor to be a villous adenoma of ampulla of Vater. This is a rare neoplasm with an incidence of 0.04-0.12% in postmortem series. A few cases have been reported in the literature, but only two documented in the Chinese literature to date. Wide excision has had good results and should be regarded as the treatment of choice for benign lesions.","title":"Villous adenoma of ampulla of Vater: a case report.","pubmedId":"7553415"}
