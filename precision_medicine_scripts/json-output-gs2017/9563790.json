Most colonic adenocarcinomas have a V positive (+), cytokeratin (CK) 20 (+), CK7-negative (-) immunophenotype; most lung adenocarcinomas have a CK20(-), CK7(+) immunophenotype. The reports of villin immunoreactivity in lung adenocarcinoma range from 6% to 68% in studies using various fixations and varied anti-villin antibodies. Some lung adenocarcinomas have microvilli with rootlets leading to possible diagnostic confusion with metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma to lung. Nine primary lung adenocarcinomas with rootlets on ultrastructure (including four bronchioloalveolar carcinomas [BAC]), four metastatic lung adenocarcinomas with rootlets, nine metastatic colon adenocarcinomas to lung, and 10 randomly selected lung adenocarcinomas without rootlets (including five BAC), were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies to villin (1D2C3), CK7 (OV-TL12/30), and CK20 (Ks20.8) using a streptavidin peroxidase technique with heat-induced epitope retrieval. All primary lung adenocarcinomas with rootlets were CK7(+) CK20(-), and six of nine (67%) were V(+). Cytoplasmic villin positivity occurred in a diffuse--five of nine (56%), focal--two of nine (22%), or brush border pattern--two of nine (22%). Two of four metastatic lung adenocarcinomas with rootlets were V(+). One metastatic lung adenocarcinoma had a CK7(+), CK20(+), V(-) phenotype. All metastatic colonic adenocarcinomas were V(+), CK20(+), CK7(-), and 1 of 10 (10%) lung adenocarcinomas without rootlets was V(+), and all 10 were CK20(-), and CK7(+). In summary, villin positivity is more common in lung adenocarcinoma with rootlets (67%) than those without rootlets (10%). AU primary lung adenocarcinomas were CK7(+), CK20(-). The combination of villin, CK 7, and CK 20 is helpful in differentiating metastatic colon adenocarcinoma from lung adenocarcinoma with rootlets.","title":"Villin, cytokeratin 7, and cytokeratin 20 expression in pulmonary adenocarcinoma with ultrastructural evidence of microvilli with rootlets.","pubmedId":"9563790"}
