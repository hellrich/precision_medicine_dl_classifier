The mutations, such as those in NRAS, BRAF, GNAQ and GNA11, promote the growth of melanoma cells in most part through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Understanding the molecular pathways of some of these mutations has resulted in the successful development of selective BRAF inhibitors. Yet, a cure for advanced melanoma is far from reality. Targeting MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), an essential intermediary kinase protein within the MAPK pathway, may be a promising way to treat patients with BRAF or other genomic mutation.\nThe authors discuss the MAPK pathway in melanoma and review the preclinical and clinical studies of the MEK inhibitor, trametinib , in melanoma. They also discuss the potential of using trametinib in the targeted therapy of advanced melanoma.\nStudies have demonstrated the activity of trametinib in BRAF-mutant melanoma, suggesting that it could be a very reasonable alternative to BRAF inhibitors for these patients. Current clinical investigations have shown great promise with the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma; a number of clinical trials of trametinib in combination with other targeted drugs are underway.","title":"Trametinib (GSK1120212) in the treatment of melanoma.","pubmedId":"23432625"}
