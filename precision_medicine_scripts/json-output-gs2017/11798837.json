The cell growth, morphological changes, cell cycle, apoptosis and molecular changes were measured using cell counting, reversmicroscope, flow cytometry, TUNEL, RT-PC, immunocytochemical assays, and in vivo therapy experiments to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of such combined regimen.\nAd-p53 transfer and CDDP (or As(2)O(3)) administration to GLC-82 cells could exertubstantially stronger therapeutic effects than the single agent treatment. Especially in in vivo experiments, combined administration of Ad-p53 and CDDP induced almost complete tumor remission (89.0%) compared to the partial tumor remission induced by single agent (43.9% or 57.3%). Moreover, delivery of Ad-p53, or administration of minimal-dose CDDP or As(2)O(3) or combined regimen could induce massive apoptosis of GLC-82 cells. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that administration of CDDP or As(2)O(3) remarkably arrested GLC-82 cells in G(2)/M prior to apoptotic cell death. When treated with combined regimen, cells were arrested in G(2)/M to a greater extent prior to apoptotic cell death.\nAfter introduced into GLC-82 cells, Ad-p53 shows enhanced therapeutic efficiency for GLC-82 cells when combined with CDDP or As(2)O(3).","title":"[Experimental study on combination of Ad-p53 with CDDP or As(2)O(3) in human lung adenocarcinoma cell line GLC-82].","pubmedId":"11798837"}
