The present study examined the association between the HPV presence and mutations in exons 19 and 21 of EGFR gene in Japanese lung cancer patients. Thirteen (31%) out of 42 cases had EGFR mutations. Although these mutations were tended to be observed in females, non-smokers, or adenocarcinomas, there was no statistically significant associations. HPV DNA was found in 7/42 (17%) lung tumors. The frequency of HPV presence did not differ in histological types. The presence of HPV DNA was significantly related to EGFR mutations (P\u003d0.021), especially in adenocarcinomas of the lung (P\u003d0.014). HPV-positive lung tumors accounted for 38% and 7% of those with and without EGFR mutations, respectively. Our results suggest that EGFR mutations are associated with HPV presence in Japanese patients with lung cancer.","title":"EGFR mutations and human papillomavirus in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22975156"}
