We analyze our previously published intraperitoneal (IP) studies in relation to BRCA mutation status and update their outcomes.\nAmong 62 patients with ovarian cancer enrolled in IP platinum doublet studies in clinical trials (with etoposide (n \u003d 18), with floxuridine (n \u003d 30), and with topotecan (n \u003d 14)), a deleterious BRCA mutation was eventually identified in 10 patients. The outcomes in these BRCA mutation carriers are described and compared with survival of others in respective trials.\nTen patients that were confirmed to have BRCA mutations-all with high-grade and stages IIC to IV disease-survived a median of 10 years (range: 4-18+) after receiving IP cisplatin-based regimens. Two continue with no evidence of disease since their IP treatment, while four others remain alive with recurrences after 8, 9, 10, and 11 years, respectively.\nThis experience suggests that IP cisplatin leads to favorable long term outcomes in advanced ovarian cancer in women with defective homologous recombination (i.e., with deleterious BRCA mutations). Whether such cisplatin dose-intensification from IP relative to (intravenous) IV drug administration leads to superior results in these mutation carriers requires further study.","title":"Ovarian cancer in BRCA mutation carriers: improved outcome after intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin.","pubmedId":"24081797"}
