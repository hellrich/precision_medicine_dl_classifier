However, there is controversy about the clinical significance of HER2 according to lymph node status in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to identify the differences in the prognostic significance of HER2 gene amplification according to the stages of breast cancer. We prepared a tissue array for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with breast cancer specimens from the surgery in 1994 to 1999. Total 338 cases of breast cancer were enrolled and the median follow-up period was 6.3 yr. The detection rates of HER2 gene amplification were as follows: 10.3% in stage I, 22.3% in stage II, and 43.8% in stage III. On survival analyses HER2-positive groups showed worse prognosis in stage III of breast cancer, but not in stage I or II. Multivariate analyses with a Cox-regression model also revealed that HER2 amplification was an independent prognostic factor only in stage III breast cancer. Regarding HER2 gene amplification as a prognostic factor of breast cancer, the clinical significance of the gene was found to be confined to advanced breast cancer.","title":"Prognostic significance of HER2 gene amplification according to stage of breast cancer.","pubmedId":"18583876"}
