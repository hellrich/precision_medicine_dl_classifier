The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel in women with locally advanced breast cancer, with or without metastatic disease. Treatment-naive women with HER2-overexpressing locally advanced breast cancer, with or without metastatic disease, were included. Patients received trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose intravenously then 2 mg/kg weekly. On day 22, docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles was added to weekly trastuzumab. Patients then underwent surgery and subsequent 4 cycles of AC (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide; 60/600 mg/m2) without trastuzumab. Weekly trastuzumab was resumed 1 month after completion of AC and continued for a year. Preliminary results from the first 22 patients with median follow-up of 15.5 months (range, 2-38 months) are reported. Of these, 9 patients (40.9%) had inflammatory breast cancer, and 6 patients (27.3%) had stage IV breast cancer. Seventeen of 22 patients (77.3%) had objective clinical response, with a clinical complete response in 9 patients (40.9%). Two patients (9.1%) had decline in cardiac function and 7 patients (31.8%) experienced neutropenia, with 2 deaths (9.1%) from neutropenic sepsis. Eight patients (36.4%) have relapsed, 3 with local skin recurrence (13.6%) and 5 with distant recurrence, of whom 1 had liver metastasis (4.5%) and 4 had brain metastasis (18.2%). Combined neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel induced high clinical response rates for HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, in particular for inflammatory breast cancer. A high rate of brain metastasis was noted, particularly in patients with baseline metastatic disease.","title":"Neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel in breast cancer: preliminary results.","pubmedId":"14715110"}
