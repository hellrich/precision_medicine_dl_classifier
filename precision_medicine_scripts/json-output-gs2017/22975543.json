The patient was a 68-year-old man diagnosed with stage IVb intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Growing low-density nodules at the cardiac interventricular septum and the left lateral wall were found on contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT). He died and an autopsy was performed. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was found to have metastasized to the myocardium, and these myocardial metastases conformed to the low-density nodules detected on CECT. A hilar nodule in the lung was revealed to be lung squamous cell carcinoma. This was a rare case of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with myocardial metastases and lung squamous cell carcinoma.","title":"Double primary cancers: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with myocardial metastases and lung squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"22975543"}
