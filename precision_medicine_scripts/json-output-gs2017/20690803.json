Most GISTs exhibit mutations in the genes encoding the stem cell factor receptor (KIT) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA). Imatinib is more effective in patients with KIT exon 11 mutations compared with KIT exon 9 mutations and wild-type genotype, while sunitinib confers greater in vitro efficacy in patients with KIT exon 9 mutants and wild-type genotype than in KIT exon 11 mutants. This review examines the potential role of mutational analysis to optimize therapy with imatinib and sunitinib for GIST.","title":"Implications of mutational analysis for the management of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors and the application of targeted therapies.","pubmedId":"20690803"}
