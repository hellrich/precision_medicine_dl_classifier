We have examined the expression of FGF-1 and FGF-2 in a series of 41 colorectal tumours (24 adenomas, 17 adenocarcinomas) and 50 gastric adenocarcinomas (23 intestinal, 27 diffuse), using immunohistochemistry. Whereas the FGF-1 distribution was cytoplasmic, FGF-2 was restricted to the nuclei of the epithelial cells. FGF-1 immunoreactivity was detected in all samples (100 per cent), whereas FGF-2 immunoreactivity was seen in 17 adenomas (71 per cent), 13 colorectal carcinomas (76 per cent), and 29 gastric carcinomas (58 per cent). Compared with the normal mucosa, FGF-1 was overexpressed in 42 per cent of colorectal adenomas, 76 per cent of colorectal cancers, and 54 per cent of gastric cancers. Conversely, FGF-2 expression was reduced in 16 (66 per cent), 8 (47 per cent), and 40 (80 per cent) adenomas and colorectal and gastric samples, respectively. We found a significant correlation only between reduced FGF-2 and gastric tumour grade. These data indicate that FGF-1 overexpression occurs in a large proportion of human colorectal and gastric cancers. This may play a role in the progression of these tumours. The topographic variation in FGF-2 expression between normal (nuclear) and tumour (cytoplasmic) cells implies a corresponding functional change that may in turn facilitate tumour growth.","title":"Fibroblast growth factor 1 and fibroblast growth factor 2 immunoreactivity in gastrointestinal tumours.","pubmedId":"9072001"}
