Inclusion key criteria included interruption of cetuximab for reasons other than progressive disease. Patients were classified according to prior regimens (0 or ≥1), prior response or stabilization, surgery of metastases, and Köhne prognostic score. At the time of subsequent progression, patients were treated with single agent panitumumab until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.\nPanitumumab obtained 67% disease control rate and 30% objective response rate, with median PFS of 4.2 and median OS of 9.6 mo. Patients with BRAF/NRAS/PI3KCA and KRAS (by mutant enriched technique) wild-type tumors had the best chance of response to panitumumab.\nSingle agent panitumumab provided significant clinical benefit in heavily pretreated patients without acquired resistance to prior cetuximab-based regimens.","title":"Single agent panitumumab in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patients following cetuximab-based regimens: Clinical outcome and biomarkers of efficacy.","pubmedId":"24025413"}
