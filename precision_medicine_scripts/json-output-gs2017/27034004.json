To investigate which lncRNAs contribute to trastuzumab resistance, we screened a microarray of lncRNAs involved in the malignant phenotype of trastuzumab-resistant SKBR-3/Tr cells. Expression of the lncRNA GAS5 was decreased in SKBR-3/Tr cells and in breast cancer tissue from trastuzumab-treated patients. Inhibition of GAS5 promoted SKBR-3 cell proliferation, and GAS5 knockdown partially reversed lapatinib-induced inhibition of SKBR-3/Tr cell proliferation. GAS5 suppresses cancer proliferation by acting as a molecular sponge for miR-21, leading to the de-repression of phosphatase and tensin homologs (PTEN), the endogenous target of miR-21. Moreover, mTOR activation associated with reduced GAS5 expression was required to suppress PTEN. This work identifies GAS5 as a novel prognostic marker and candidate drug target for HER2-positive breast cancer.
