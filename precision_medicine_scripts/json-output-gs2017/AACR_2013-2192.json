Although EML4-ALK is reported to be formed by inversion of chromosome 2, other mechanisms of gene fusion remain unknown. Here we characterize the EML4-ALK fusion gene of a new cell line derived from a patient of NSCLC. In addition, the efficacy of ALK inhibitors against this new cell line was examined.Experimental Design: An EML4-ALK-positive cell line, termed LC649, was established from pleomorphic carcinoma, a rare subtype of NSCLC. We investigated the chromosomal aberrations using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). CH5424802, a selective ALK inhibitor, was evaluated in the antitumor activity against LC649 in vitro and in vivo xenograft model.Results: Our initial characterization revealed that LC649 harbors variant 3 of EML4-ALK fusion with 2-fold copy number gain. Interestingly, CGH and metaphase-FISH analysis showed that LC649 contained, in addition to two normal chromosome 2, two aberrant chromosome 2 that were fragmented and scattered. These observations provided the first evidence that EML4-ALK fusion in LC649 cells was formed in chromosome 2 by a distinct mechanism of genomic rearrangement, termed chromothripsis. Additionally, CH5424802 inhibited phospho-ALK and suppressed tumor growth of the LC649 cells in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft model.Conclusions: Our results suggested that chromothripsis may be a mechanism of oncogenic rearrangement of EML4-ALK. CH5424802 was effective against EML4-ALK positive tumors with ALK copy number gain mediated by chromothripsis.","title":"A novel mechanism of EML4-ALK rearrangement in a patient-derived cell line and its tumor growth inhibition by an ALK inhibitor CH5424802.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-2192"}
