Gene copy number was evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization, and an FGFR1 amplified tumor (FGFR1 amp+) was prespecified if one of the following criteria is fulfilled: (I) FGFR1/centromer 8 (CEN8) ration is  2.0, (II) average gene copy nucleus is  6.0, and (III) percentage of tumor cells containing  15 gene copies or large cluster is  10%.ResultsFGFR1 amplification was detected in 8% (44 of 549) of ESCC. The average copy number per nucleus was 2.7 (range, 0-15.5) and the mean FGFR1/CEN8 ratio was 2.2 (range, 0-6). The 5-year disease free survival of the FGFR1 amp+ group was significantly shorter compared with that of the FGFR1amp- group (38.8% vs 63.7% P\u003d0.012). In Cox proportional hazard model, patients with FGFR1 amp+ had a significantly greater risk of recurrence compare to amp- group after adjusting for sex, smoking status, pathologic stage, histology, and adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 1.74; 95% CI, 1.10-2.76, P\u003d0.018). Of note, there was a trend toward worse overall survival for FGFR1 amp+ group compare to amp- group (5-year OS 32.0% vs 50.8%, P\u003d0.11). FGFR1 amp+ group was significantly more likely to be smokers than FGFR1amp- group (97.7 % vs 2.3%, P\u003d0.001). With increment of total cigarette smoking dosage, the incidence of FGFR1 amp+ significantly increased (P trend\u003d0.005).ConclusionsFGFR1 amplification is an independent prognostic factor for recurrence in surgically resected ESCC.
