A total of 118 familial colorectal cancer patients from the Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer Registry and Genetic Testing Project of the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum, were assessed to determine whether smoking alters the incidence of multiple colorectal cancers. In male patients with Lynch syndrome (n \u003d 29), the incidence of multiple colorectal cancers in patients who had ever smoked (smoking duration: median of 19 years) was higher than that in those who never smoked (58.8% vs. 10.0%, P \u003d 0.02). The cumulative risk for metachronous colorectal cancer was significantly higher in male Lynch syndrome patients who had previously smoked than in those who had never smoked (P \u003d 0.03). Our data suggest that long-term cigarette smoking might be a strong risk factor for the development of multiple colorectal cancers in male Lynch syndrome patients.
