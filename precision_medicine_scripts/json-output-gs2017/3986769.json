The amplified sequences have been localized to a marker chromosome by in situ hybridization. Sublines of MCF-7, serially passaged in different laboratories, have marked variation in the degree of N-ras amplification. The differing degrees of amplification of N-ras are further evidence of heterogeneity within MCF-7 subclones. The phenomenon may not have general relevance for breast cancer, since other breast cancer cell lines and DNA from patient biopsies failed to show evidence of N-ras amplification.","title":"Varying degrees of amplification of the N-ras oncogene in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.","pubmedId":"3986769"}
