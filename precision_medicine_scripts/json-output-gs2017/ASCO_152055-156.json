These mutations occur in 4% of lung adenocarcinomas but have not been clinically assessed (TCGA 2014).  We now report responses to the MET inhibitors crizotinib and cabozantinib in patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas harboring mutations leading to MET exon 14 skipping.  Methods:    Patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas harboring MET exon 14 splice site mutations (N\u003d6) or a mutation deleting Y1003 in exon 14 (N\u003d1) were identified through a clinical assay based on hybrid capture/next-generation sequencing of 341 oncogenes and tumor suppressors (MSK-IMPACT).  MET IHC was performed on archival FFPE tissue.  RNA skipping was confirmed by NanoString.  Radiographic response to MET inhibition was assessed using RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST criteria.   Results:    Clinicopathologic data for those treated are in the table below.  To date, 3 patients have been treated with off-label crizotinib and 1 with cabozantinib (NCT01639508).  3 of 4 patients (75%) developed a PR to treatment.  The remaining patient had SD by RECIST, with PET imaging demonstrating a complete PERCIST response.   Conclusions: MET exon 14 skipping is a novel oncogenic target that predicts for response to MET inhibitors.  This appears to be a substantially better predictor of response than either protein expression or gene amplification.  Patients with these splice site mutations should be treated on a clinical trial of a MET inhibitor.  For those without access to a trial, use of off-label crizotinib should be considered.
