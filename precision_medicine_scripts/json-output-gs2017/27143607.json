We previously reported the importance of eNOS activation in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) tissues and cell lines. The present study aims to investigate the relative abundance of eNOS and phosphorylated eNOS (P-eNOS) and their upstream regulators VEGFR3, VEGFC, EphA3 and ephrin-A1, in the Opisthorchis viverrini (Ov)/N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)-induced hamster CCA model and in human CCA by semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of the relevant tissues. Results from the hamster model suggested an increase in eNOS and P-eNOS and upstream regulators during CCA genesis. In human CCA, high immunohistochemical staining intensity of all investigated proteins was associated with the presence of metastasis. A pairwise analysis of the staining data for eNOS and its upstream regulators showed that a concurrent increase in eNOS/VEGFR3, eNOS/ephrin-A1, eNOS/VEGFC and eNOS/EphA3 was significantly associated with metastasis. An increase in eNOS/VEGFR3, eNOS/ephrin-A1 was also associated with non-papillary type CCA. Additionally, an increase in eNOS and P-eNOS was significantly correlated with a high micro-vessel level (P\u003d0.04). Our results indicate that the development of CCA involves upregulation of eNOS and P-eNOS and their regulators. This may drive angiogenesis and metastasis in CCA.","title":"Upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and its upstream regulators in Opisthorchis viverrini associated cholangiocarcinoma and its clinical significance.","pubmedId":"27143607"}
