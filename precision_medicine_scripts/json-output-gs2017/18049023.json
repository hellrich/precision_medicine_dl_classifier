The subjects were 6,186 workers (age 19 to 69 years), who worked at 12 workplaces in Japan and who continuously participated in the High-risk and Population Strategy for Occupational Health Promotion (HIPOP-OHP) study at the baseline (1999 or 2000) and the subsequent year (2000 or 2001). No intervention was performed during the study period. Blood pressure and total cholesterol level were measured at baseline. Awareness and treatment status were examined by a self-administered questionnaire in the following year. Untreated subjects were defined as those were not aware of hypertension (or hypercholesterolemia) or those not taking medication and not undergoing lifestyle modification. The percentages of subjects with hypertension defined as aware were 65.7% in men and 72.7% in women, respectively. The percentages of subjects with hypercholesterolemia defined as aware were 55.7% in men and 58.6% in women, respectively. In subjects 40 years and older, the awareness rate for hypertension was significantly higher than the awareness rate for hypercholesterolemia (75.0% vs. 59.2%, p\u003c0.001). The percentage of untreated subjects with hypertension was significantly lower than the percentage of untreated subjects with hypercholesterolemia (41.0% vs. 57.1%, p\u003c0.001). Although Japanese workers \u003e/\u003d40 years old have a higher awareness of and are more often treated for hypertension than for hypercholesterolemia, there are still many unaware and untreated individuals with either disease in all age groups. It is important to increase the awareness of risk factors in individuals with positive findings for these conditions.","title":"Awareness and treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in Japanese workers: the High-risk and Population Strategy for Occupational Health Promotion (HIPOP-OHP) study.","pubmedId":"18049023"}
