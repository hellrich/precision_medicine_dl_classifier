Pancreatic tissue samples retrieved, during pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer, from cancer patients with and without type 2 diabetes were processed for immunohistochemistry. The pancreatic tissue samples were retrieved from non-cancerous and clear margins. An immunofluorescence technique was used to examine the expression of resistin and its co-localization with insulin and glucagon in pancreatic islet cells. Resistin was observed in many cells located in the central region of pancreatic islet. The expression of resistin increased significantly (p \u003c 0.0001) in pancreatic islet cells of type 2 diabetic patients compared to control. Resistin co-localized with insulin but not glucagon in pancreatic islet cells of both normal and diabetic patients. However, the degree of co-localization was higher in pancreata of diabetic patients compared to normal. The number of human pancreatic islet cells expressing resistin increased significantly after the onset of type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, resistin may play a role in the regulation of pancreatic Î²-cell function.","title":"Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased expression of resistin in human pancreatic islet cells.","pubmedId":"21750415"}
