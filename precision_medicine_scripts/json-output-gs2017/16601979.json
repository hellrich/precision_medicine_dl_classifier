In our study, we investigated the effect of the transplantation of a low number (n \u003d 350) of pancreatic islets into the right liver part on the neighboring portal bile ducts. Male streptozotocin- diabetic Lewis or autoimmune-diabetic BB/Pfd rats (n \u003d 1065) were subdivided into 11 experimental groups. A few days after low-number islet transplantation, cholangiocytes adjacent to the grafts showed an increase in proliferative activity. During the next 12-24 months, many peri-insular ductules progressed via tumor-like cystic lesions to large cystic cholangiomas, accompanied by a translocation of the insulin receptor into the cytoplasm and an increase in expression of insulin-related signaling proteins (Insulin-receptor-substrate-1, Raf-1, Mek-1). After 24 months, 53% of rats with low-number transplantation exhibited at least one cholangioma \u003e10 mm, significantly outnumbering tumor development in the transplant-free left liver part and in any control group. No cholangiocarcinomas emerged. A graft cell origin of the tumors was excluded by Y chromosome in situ hybridization in cross-gender transplantations. Conclusively, low-number intrahepatic islet transplantation, most likely acting by permanent local hyperinsulinism, leads to prolonged cholangiocellular proliferation in streptozotocin- and in autoimmune-diabetic rats, resulting in the development of benign cystic cholangiomas.","title":"Cystic cholangiomas after transplantation of pancreatic islets into the livers of diabetic rats.","pubmedId":"16601979"}
