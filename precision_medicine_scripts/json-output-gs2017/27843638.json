We describe a comprehensive approach employing gene expression analysis in early lesions to identify novel therapeutic targets and the use of mouse models to test synthetic lethal drug combinations to treat human Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS)-driven lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma: combined DDR1/Notch inhibition as an effective therapy.","pubmedId":"27843638"}
