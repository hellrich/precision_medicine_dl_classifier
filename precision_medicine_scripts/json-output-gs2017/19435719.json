The aim of the current study was to validate these potential RA susceptibility markers in a UK population.\nA total of 4 SNPs (rs4810485 in CD40, rs2812378 in CCL21, rs42041 in CDK6 and rs6682654 in CD244) were genotyped in a UK cohort comprising 3962 UK patients with RA and 3531 healthy controls using the Sequenom iPlex platform. Genotype counts in patients and controls were analysed with the chi(2) test using Stata.\nAssociation to the CD40 gene was robustly replicated (p\u003d2 x 10(-4), OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.93) and modest evidence was found for association with the CCL21 locus (p\u003d0.04, OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16). However, there was no evidence for association of rs42041 (CDK6) and rs6682654 (CD244) with RA susceptibility in this UK population. Following a meta-analysis including the original data, association to CD40 was confirmed (p\u003d7.8 x 10(-8), OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.92).\nIn this large UK cohort, strong association of the CD40 gene with susceptibility to RA was found, and weaker evidence for association with RA in the CCL21 locus.","title":"Association of CD40 with rheumatoid arthritis confirmed in a large UK case-control study.","pubmedId":"19435719"}
