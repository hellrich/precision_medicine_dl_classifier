This article summarizes some of the more important laboratory efforts directed at understanding the biology of this complex disease. The radiation sensitivities of established lung cancer cell lines are outlined. The effect of radiation dose rate and chemotherapy is explored. The emerging biology of oncogenetic alterations is explored as it relates to radiation sensitivity in general, and lung cancer in particular. Finally, novel therapeutic approaches including photodynamic therapy are introduced.","title":"Radiation biology of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"8806097"}
