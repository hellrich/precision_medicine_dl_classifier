C-kit and PDGFRα mutations were found in 151 cases (84.4%) and 8 cases (4.5%) except for the wild types of the rest 20 cases (11.2%). Among all the c-kit mutation, 92.2% mutation types in exon 11 were deletion mutation, point mutation and hybrid mutations, and in exon 9 the mutation types were just involving A502_Y503dup (n \u003d 6) and Y403_F504ins (n \u003d 14), while the mutation type were K642Q in exon 13 (n \u003d 1) and N822K in 17 (n \u003d 2). There were 6 patients with the mutation types of PDGFRα in exon 18, and 3 of them were type of D842V. In the GIST genotyping, DOG-1 positive rate in PDGFRα mutation patients were significantly lower than that in c-kit mutation and wild type patients (P \u003d 0.007). In the various type of c-kit mutations, the positive rate of CD34 in point mutation patients were significantly lower than that in other mutation types (P \u003c 0.001). The rate of high-risk patients in point mutation and insertion mutation patients were lower than that in deletion mutation and deletion + insertion mutation patients (P \u003d 0.006).\nThe most common localizaions of GISTs are the stomach and small intestine. The most frequent mutation type of GIST is c-kit exon 11. The individualized treatment is required for GIST patients because its high mutation rate and types.","title":"[Characteristics of Clinicopathology and Genotype in 179 Cases with Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor].","pubmedId":"27263309"}
