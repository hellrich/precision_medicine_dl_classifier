We have previously shown that H-Ras, but not N-Ras, induces an invasive phenotype mediated by small GTPase Rac1 in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in aberrant growth and metastasis formation of many tumor types including breast cancer. The present study aims to investigate the correlation between EGF-induced invasiveness and Ras activation in four widely used breast cancer cell lines. Upon EGF stimulation, invasive abilities and H-Ras activation were significantly increased in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, but not in MDA-MB-453 and T47D cell lines. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target H-Ras, we showed a crucial role of H-Ras in the invasive phenotype induced by EGF in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, siRNA-knockdown of Rac1 significantly inhibited the EGF-induced invasiveness in these cells. Taken together, this study characterized human breast cancer cell lines with regard to the relationship between H-Ras activation and the invasive phenotype induced by EGF. Our data demonstrate that the activation of H-Ras and the downstream molecule Rac1 correlates with EGF-induced breast cancer cell invasion, providing important information on the regulation of malignant progression in mammary carcinoma cells.","title":"Activation of H-Ras and Rac1 correlates with epidermal growth factor-induced invasion in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"21281602"}
