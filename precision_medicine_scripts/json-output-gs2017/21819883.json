This article discusses the surgical approaches for resection, especially the transnasal endoscopic approach. Alternative treatment options are primarily used where patients are not surgical candidates or location of recurrence precludes additional surgery. These options include radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and chemotherapy. In addition, we discuss the current on going research in molecular targeting agents for meningioma treatment.","title":"Olfactory groove meningioma.","pubmedId":"21819883"}
