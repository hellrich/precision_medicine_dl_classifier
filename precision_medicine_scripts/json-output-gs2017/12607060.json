Based on our 25-year experience, the results of 194 patients after a standardized Kausch-Whipple resection for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were analyzed and the prognostic factors were evaluated. Between 1972 and 1998 a total of 221 patients were diagnosed for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head, and 194 of them subsequently underwent a standardized Kausch-Whipple resection. Long-term results and prognostic factors were examined by multivariate and univariate analyses. The overall postoperative mortality was 3.09%, and the morbidity was 29.9%. By multivariate analysis only curative resection (R0) was significantly related to a favorable prognosis ( p \u003c 0.0001). Furthermore, in case of a curative resection, the presence of lymph node metastases showed prognostic significance in the multivariate analysis ( p \u003d 0.005). Cumulative survival analysis revealed a 5-year survival rate of 25.4%, a 7-year survival rate of 12.3%, and a 10-year survival rate of 8.2% for patients who underwent curative resection (R0) for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. We demonstrated that the R0 status is the only independent prognostic factor after surgery for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. In the case of a curative resection, the presence of lymph node metastases is of prognostic relevance. In view of considerable surgical morbidity and mortality, resection for cancer of the pancreatic head is the only option if the lesion is resectable. We concluded that surgical treatment is \"as good as it gets,\" as extended techniques have not proved to produce better results.","title":"Long-term results of partial pancreaticoduodenectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head: 25-year experience.","pubmedId":"12607060"}
