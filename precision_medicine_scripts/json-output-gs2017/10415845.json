In order to begin to understand the mechanisms by which genes of both cell types are expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, an understanding of the underlying transcription factors is important. PDX1 plays an important role in the development of the pancreas and is also expressed in the adult pancreas; it is known to be involved in the regulation of expression of both acinar and islet cell-specific gene products. We have examined pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines and have determined that they also express PDX1, making it a candidate transcription factor for the abnormal regulation of these acinar and duc cell gene products.","title":"Gene expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"10415845"}
