One result of this additional surgical stress may be that postoperative complications in patients with pancreatic cancer are more frequent than in patients with periampullary cancer.\nThe 198 patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. The operative mortality and morbidity between patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer were compared, and the risk factors of postoperative complications and in-hospital death were determined.\nPatients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer made up 52% and 48% of total patients. The duration of surgery and volume of intraoperative blood loss were significantly higher in patients with pancreatic cancer than in patients with periampullary cancer. Additional organ resections were frequently performed in patients with pancreatic cancer. However, significantly lower morbidity rates were observed in patients with pancreatic cancer. Among all complications evaluated, pancreatic fistula and abdominal abscess were found less frequently in patients with pancreatic cancer. Logistic regression analyses showed a positive correlation between periampullary cancer and an increased risk of complications, pancreatic fistula, and abdominal abscess. The in-hospital mortality rate has significantly reduced since 2000. When pancreatic fistula was clinically diagnosed, we immediately started a closed lavage using continuous administration of natural saline at 1000 to 4000 mL/d, after exchange of a nasogastric tube drain.\nPancreaticoduodenectomy for patients with pancreatic cancer can be a safe procedure in spite of surgical stress. Further surgical strategies will be needed to reduce postoperative complications, especially in patients with periampullary cancer.","title":"Less morbidity after pancreaticoduodenectomy of patients with pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"16804412"}
