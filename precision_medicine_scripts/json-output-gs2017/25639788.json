In contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS (CH-EUS), diffuse homogeneous enhancement is obtained in normal parenchyma of the pancreas. The bile duct and pancreatic duct are depicted as non-enhanced ductal structures with strong contrast in comparison to the surrounding parenchyma. CH-EUS identifies pancreatic adenocarcinomas as solid lesions exhibiting hypo-enhancement with a sensitivity and specificity of 88-96% and 88-94%, respectively. In particular, 80-100% of false-negative cases in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) are correctly classified by CH-EUS, suggesting CH-EUS complements EUS-FNA. Moreover, CH-EUS improves depiction of some subtle lesions in conventional EUS, thus facilitating EUS-FNA. For quantitative perfusion analysis, a time-intensity curve (TIC) for the region of interest can be generated during CH-EUS. The maximum intensity gain and the echo intensity reduction rate from the peak at 1 min obtained by TIC can be used for differentiation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma from other tumors. CH-EUS is also useful for differentiation of invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) from non-invasive IPMN, identification of malignant lesions in the gallbladder, and T- and N-staging of pancreatobiliary tumors.","title":"Contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasonography for pancreatobiliary diseases.","pubmedId":"25639788"}
