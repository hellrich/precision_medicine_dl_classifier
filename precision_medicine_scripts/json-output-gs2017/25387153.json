To design novel efficient strategies for treatment of cancer and other diseases, these kinases have been extensively studied. Despite their different nature, these two kinase families have related origin and share very similar kinase domains. Therefore, chemical inhibitors of these kinases usually carry analogous structural motifs. The most common feature of these inhibitors is a critical hydrogen bond to morpholine oxygen, initially present in the early nonspecific PI3K and PIKK inhibitor 3 (LY294002), which served as a valuable chemical tool for development of many additional PI3K and PIKK inhibitors. While several PI3K pathway inhibitors have recently shown promising clinical responses, inhibitors of the DNA damage-related PIKKs remain thus far largely in preclinical development.
