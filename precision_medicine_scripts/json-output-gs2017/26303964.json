The patients were followed-up on a regular base to monitor possible side-effects.\nA plantar or palmar fibromatosis was observed in five of 53 patients treated with vemurafenib. In four of these patients other risk factors for the development of palmoplantar fibromatosis were absent.\nThe BRAF-inhibitor vemurafenib might induce palmoplantar fibromatosis.","title":"Vemurafenib-associated Dupuytren- and Ledderhose palmoplantar fibromatosis in metastatic melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"26303964"}
