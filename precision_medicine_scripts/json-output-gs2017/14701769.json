On the basis of evidence that p53 mutation is involved in the development of human neoplasia, we examined the prognostic value of p53 alterations in combination with neu/erbB-2 amplification.\nA consecutive series of women were observed for recurrence and death (median follow-up of 85 months) and tumors from 543 individuals were analyzed for p53 mutation status and neu/erbB-2 amplification. Exons 4 through 10 of the p53 gene were analyzed by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The association of p53 mutation status and neu/erbB-2 amplification with risk of recurrence and death was examined in survival analyses with traditional and histologic markers as prognostic factors.\np53 mutations occurred in 24.5% of the axillary node-negative breast carcinomas. Mutations were more frequent in carcinomas with neu/erbB-2 amplification: 38.9% compared with only 20.9% in those without neu/erbB-2 amplification. We found elevated risks of disease recurrence and overall mortality in patients with both p53 mutation and neu/erbB-2 amplification in their tumor compared with patients with neither or only one of the alterations. This increase persisted with adjustment for other prognostic factors (relative risk, 2.32; P \u003d.002 for recurrence; relative risk, 2.22; P \u003d.004 for death).\nEvaluation of tumors for p53 mutations may be beneficial to identify women at higher risk of disease recurrence and death when the tumor has neu/erbB-2 amplification, but in the absence of neu/erbB-2 amplification, the presence of p53 mutation may not provide additional independent prognostic information.","title":"The combination of p53 mutation and neu/erbB-2 amplification is associated with poor survival in node-negative breast cancer.","pubmedId":"14701769"}
