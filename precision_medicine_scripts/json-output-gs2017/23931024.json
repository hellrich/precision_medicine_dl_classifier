This approach acknowledges cancer as a genetic disease, driven by alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors, with the strategy of using this information to guide therapy based on therapeutics capable of targeting specific alterations. Recent advances suggest a changing landscape in how management decisions are approached for the patient with non-small cell lung cancer. An expanding and functionally useful toolbox of novel targeted agents and biomarkers to drive therapeutic choices is beginning to impact patient care. This article reviews key advances, with commentary and perspective for the practicing thoracic surgical oncologist.
