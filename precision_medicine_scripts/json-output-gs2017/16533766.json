Although gene amplifications of PIK3CA have been reported in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), small mutation of the gene has not been evaluated in HNSCC previously. In this study, we examined the mutation frequency of PIK3CA in HNSCC.\nMore than 75% of the somatic mutations of PIK3CA are clustered in the helical (exon 9) and kinase domains (exon 20). To investigate the possible role of PIK3CA in HNSCC tumorigenesis, exons 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 20 of the gene were analyzed by direct genomic DNA sequencing in 38 HNSCC specimens.\nWe identified four missense mutations in the seven exons of PIK3CA from 38 HNSCC specimens (11%). Three of the four mutations (i.e., H1047R, E542K, and E545K) have been previously reported as hotspot mutations. The remaining novel mutation, Y343C, is identified at exon 4 nucleotide 1028 A --\u003e G. Three of the four mutations were shown to be somatic, whereas the fourth mutation (H1047R) was identified in a cell line. Interestingly, three of the four mutations identified were in pharyngeal cancer samples.\nThese data provide evidence that oncogenic properties of PIK3CA contribute to the carcinogenesis of human head and neck cancers, especially in pharyngeal cancer. A specific kinase inhibitor to PIK3CA may potentially be an effective therapeutic reagent against HNSCC or pharyngeal cancer in particular.","title":"PIK3CA mutations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16533766"}
