The follow-up period was 1499 person-years for the whole group from the diagnosis of index melanoma with an average of 2 years. Standardized incidence rate (SIR) was established as the ratio of observed and expected values. The risk of all subsequent malignancies was 15- and 10-fold higher in males (SIR: 15.42) and in females (SIR: 10.55) with melanoma, than in the general population. The increased cancer risk resulted mainly from the significantly higher skin tumor development: SIR values were 160.39 and 92.64 for additional invasive melanoma and 342.28 and 77.04 for subsequent in situ melanoma in males and females, respectively. Non-melanoma skin cancers also notably contributed to the higher risk, the SIR was elevated in both genders to the same extent (males: 17.12, females: 17.55). The risk was also significantly higher for extracutaneous tumor development like chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon and kidney cancer (both genders), non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma, cervical cancer (females), and bladder carcinoma (males). These data underline the importance of patient education and the necessity of frequent medical follow up, including a close-up dermatological screening of melanoma survivors for further malignancies.","title":"Risk of subsequent primary tumor development in melanoma patients.","pubmedId":"23681370"}
