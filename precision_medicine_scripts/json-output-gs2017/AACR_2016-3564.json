NF-B is a key transcription factor promoting cancer cell survival, but therapeutically targeting this pathway has proved difficult because NF-B has pleiotropic functions. Here, we report that MUC13 prevents colorectal cancer cell death by promoting two distinct pathways of NF-kB activation, consequently up-regulating BCL-XL. MUC13 promoted TNF-induced NF-B activation by interacting with TNFR1 and the E3 ligase, cIAP1, to increase ubiquitination of RIPK1. MUC13 also promoted genotoxin-induced NF-B activation by increasing phosphorylation of ATM and SUMOylation of NEMO. Moreover, elevated expression of cytoplasmic MUC13 and NF-B correlated with colorectal cancer progression and metastases. Our demonstration that MUC13 enhances NF-B signalling in response to both TNF and DNA damaging agents provides a new molecular target for specific inhibition of NF-B activation. As proof of principle, silencing MUC13 sensitized colorectal cancer cells to death in response to cytotoxic drugs and inflammatory signals and abolished chemotherapy-induced enrichment of CD133+ CD44+ cancer stem cells, slowed xenograft growth in mice, and synergized with 5-fluourouracil to induce tumor regression. Therefore, these data indicate that combining chemotherapy and MUC13 antagonism could improve the treatment of metastatic cancers.","title":"MUC13 protects colorectal cancer cells from death by activating the NF-b pathway and is a potential therapeutic target","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3564"}
