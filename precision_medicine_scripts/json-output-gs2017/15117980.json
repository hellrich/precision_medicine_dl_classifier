Patients received pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) intravenously (i.v.) day 1 with vitamin B(12), folic acid, and dexamethasone or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) i.v. day 1 with dexamethasone every 21 days. The primary end point was overall survival.\nFive hundred seventy-one patients were randomly assigned. Overall response rates were 9.1% and 8.8% (analysis of variance P \u003d.105) for pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 2.9 months for each arm, and median survival time was 8.3 versus 7.9 months (P \u003d not significant) for pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively. The 1-year survival rate for each arm was 29.7%. Patients receiving docetaxel were more likely to have grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (40.2% v 5.3%; P \u003c.001), febrile neutropenia (12.7% v 1.9%; P \u003c.001), neutropenia with infections (3.3% v 0.0%; P \u003d.004), hospitalizations for neutropenic fever (13.4% v 1.5%; P \u003c.001), hospitalizations due to other drug related adverse events (10.5% v 6.4%; P \u003d.092), use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support (19.2% v 2.6%, P \u003c.001) and all grade alopecia (37.7% v 6.4%; P \u003c.001) compared with patients receiving pemetrexed.\nTreatment with pemetrexed resulted in clinically equivalent efficacy outcomes, but with significantly fewer side effects compared with docetaxel in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC and should be considered a standard treatment option for second-line NSCLC when available.","title":"Randomized phase III trial of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer previously treated with chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"15117980"}
