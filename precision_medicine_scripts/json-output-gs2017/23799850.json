However, the issue of resistance remains unresolved. The aim of this study was to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that govern the resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer.\nmiRNA microarray analysis using gemcitabine-resistant clones of MiaPaCa2 (MiaPaCa2-RGs), PSN1 (PSN1-RGs), and their parental cells (MiaPaCa2-P, PSN1-P) was conducted. Changes in the anti-cancer effects of gemcitabine were studied after gain/loss-of-function analysis of the candidate miRNA. Further assessment of the putative target gene was performed in vitro and in 66 pancreatic cancer clinical samples.\nmiR-320c expression was significantly higher in MiaPaCa2-RGs and PSN1-RGs than in their parental cells. miR-320c induced resistance to gemcitabine in MiaPaCa2. Further experiments showed that miR-320c-related resistance to gemcitabine was mediated through SMARCC1, a core subunit of the switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex. In addition, clinical examination revealed that only SMARCC1-positive patients benefited from gemcitabine therapy with regard to survival after recurrence (P\u003d0.0463).\nThe results indicate that miR-320c regulates the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine through SMARCC1, suggesting that miR-320c/SMARCC1 could be suitable for prediction of the clinical response and potential therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer patients on gemcitabine-based therapy.","title":"miR-320c regulates gemcitabine-resistance in pancreatic cancer via SMARCC1.","pubmedId":"23799850"}
