In this study, we investigated RB and p53 pathways in 46 epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs). In the RB pathway, 16 (34.8%) of 46 cases had p16 gene alterations or loss of expression. The deletion of the p16 gene was a rare event. In 7 cases, we observed methylation in the 5\u0027CpG island in the promoter region of the p16 gene. Abnormal expressions of pRb and CDK4/cyclin D1 were 10.9% and 30.4%, respectively. In the p53 pathway, 10 (21.7%) of 46 cases had p14ARF gene alterations or abnormal expression. In 4 cases, methylation in the 5\u0027CpG island in the promoter region of the p14ARF gene was present. MDM2 overexpression was a rare event. Thirty-six (78.3%) of 46 patients had p53 gene alterations or expression. In our studied cases, p14ARF abnormalities were independent of p16 abnormalities. Abnormal RB and p53 pathways were present in 60.9% and 80.4% of cases, respectively. In conclusion, disruptions of p53 and RB pathways are frequent events and the inverse correlations were present between the abnormality of p16 and p14ARF in EOCs.","title":"Combined analysis of p53 and RB pathways in epithelial ovarian cancer.","pubmedId":"11567230"}
