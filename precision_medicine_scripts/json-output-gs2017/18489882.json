After 18 months, at 32, he developed a subareolar lump which proved to be invasive ductal carcinoma. There were no epidemiological or genetic risk factors, no mutations in BRCA 1 + 2. Male breast cancer (MBC) patients have a lower survival rate than females due to a delay in diagnosis. Greater focus on MBC is necessary in order to change this.\nWe chose to follow the guidelines for young women. Some studies imply that early MBC is more benign but there are no randomised trials on treatment.","title":"[Breast cancer in 32-year-old male].","pubmedId":"18489882"}
