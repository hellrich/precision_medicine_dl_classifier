Sixty-one NSCLC tissue specimens were included in the study. The expression of MET and cyclin D1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and MET gene copy number was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Positive expression of MET and cyclin D1 protein and increased MET gene copy number occurred in 59.0%, 59.0% and 18.0% of 61 NSCLC tissues, respectively. MET-positivity correlated with poor differentiation (P \u003d 0.009). Increased MET gene copy number was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.004) and advanced tumor stage (P \u003d 0.048), while the expression of cyclin D1 was not associated with any clinicopathologic parameters. There was a significant correlation between the expression of MET and MET gene copy number (P \u003d 0.002). Additionally, the expression of cyclin D1 had a significant association with the expression of MET as well as MET gene copy number (P \u003d 0.002 and P \u003d 0.017, respectively). MET-positivity and increased MET gene copy number were significantly associated with poor overall survival (P \u003d 0.003 and P \u003c 0.001, respectively) in univariate analysis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis confirmed that the expression of MET and MET gene copy number were prognostic indicators of NSCLC (P \u003d 0.003 and P \u003d 0.001, respectively). The overexpression of MET and the increased MET gene copy number might be adverse prognostic factors for NSCLC patients. The activation of the MET/cyclin D1 signaling pathway may contribute to carcinogenesis and the development of NSCLC, and may represent a target for therapy.","title":"Prognostic value of MET, cyclin D1 and MET gene copy number in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23720678"}
