A strong positive correlation between CCND1 amplification and higher levels of cyclin D1 expression was found (P \u003c 0.001). Basal-like cancers showed infrequent CCND1 amplification and cyclin D1 overexpression (P \u003c 0.001). Both CCND1 amplification and cyclin D1 expression were associated with positive ER status. CCND1 gene amplification was an independent prognostic factor for patients with ER positive breast cancer.\nOur results demonstrate a strong correlation between CCND1 amplification and its protein expression in breast cancer. However, protein expression is more pervasive than gene amplification and associated with ER expression.","title":"CCND1 amplification and cyclin D1 expression in breast cancer and their relation with proteomic subgroups and patient outcome.","pubmedId":"17653856"}
