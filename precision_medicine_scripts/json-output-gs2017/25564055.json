The correlation between clinicopathological features and sensitivity of CA19-9/CEA was analyzed by chi-square test. The correlation of clinicopathological features and value of serum CA19-9/CEA was analyzed by t test and F test.\nThe average value of CA19-9 before surgery in the 126 patients was 595.3 U/ml. The values of CA19-9 in 91 patients were abnormal and the sensitivity of CA19-9 was 72.2%. The average value of CEA before surgery was 12.6 U/ml. The value of CEA in 26 patients were abnormal and the sensitivity of CEA was 20.6%. The values of combined detection of serum CA19-9 and CEA before surgery were abnormal in a total of 97 cases with a sensitivity of 77.0%. There was no significant correlation between clinicopathological features and sensitivity of CA19-9 (P \u003e 0.05). The location of tumor was significantly correlated to the diagnostic sensitivity of CEA. The sensitivity of CEA to distal ECC was only 15.4%. The value of CA19-9 was relatively high in patients \u003e60-year old or with neural invasion, while CEA was higher when tumor was located in the middle of bile duct (P \u003c 0.05). There was no significant difference of serum CA19-9 before and after jaundice reduction (P \u003e 0.05).\nThe diagnostic sensitivity of CA19-9 is not affected by gender, age, blood type, tumor location, degree of differentiation, tumor size, T stage, vascular tumor thrombus, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion, and preoperative jaundice. However, the diagnostic sensitivity of CEA is affected by tumor location. The value of CA19-9 is correlated with tumor invasion and is relatively high in patients above 60 years old.","title":"[Correlation between clinicopathological features and CA19-9/CEA in patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"25564055"}
