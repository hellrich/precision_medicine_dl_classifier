Using primary cultured GIST cells, the effect of SCF-mediated wild-type KIT receptor activation was determined by western blotting, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT), and apoptosis assays.\nWe found that wild-type KIT receptor and SCF protein were expressed in 100% and 76.5% of the 51 GIST samples, respectively, and the co-expression of wild-type KIT receptor and SCF was associated with known indicators of poor prognosis, including larger tumor size (P \u003d 0.0118), higher mitotic count (P \u003d 0.0058), higher proliferative index (P \u003d 0.0012), higher mitotic index (P \u003d 0.0282), lower apoptosis index (P \u003d 0.0484), and increased National Institutes of Health risk level (P \u003d 0.0012). We also found that the introduction of exogenous SCF potently increased KIT kinase activity, stimulated cell proliferation (P \u003c 0.01) and inhibited apoptosis (P \u003c 0.01) induced by serum starvation, while a KIT immunoblocking antibody suppressed proliferation (P \u003d 0.01) and promoted apoptosis (P \u003c 0.01) in cultured GIST cells.\nSCF-mediated wild-type KIT receptor activation plays an important role in GIST cell growth. The inhibition of SCF-mediated wild-type KIT receptor activation may prove to be particularly important for GIST therapy.","title":"Stem cell factor-mediated wild-type KIT receptor activation is critical for gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell growth.","pubmedId":"22736916"}
