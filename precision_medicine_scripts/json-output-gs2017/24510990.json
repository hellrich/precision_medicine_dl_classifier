The aim of the present study was to develop a simple and versatile tool to determine EGFR and KRAS mutations for pre-clinical research in the laboratory. We developed a melting curve analysis to detect exon 19 deletion, L858R mutation, and T790M mutation of EGFR, and codon 12/13 and codon 61 mutations of KRAS using LightCycler480 with mutation-specific sensor and anchor probes. The analytical method was applicable to determine the approximate rate of heterogeneity of mutation in the genomic DNA of cancer cell lines. In conclusion, our melting curve analysis is a rapid and semi-quantitative method to screen for exon 19 deletion, L858R or T790M mutations of EGFR and codon 12/13/61 mutations of KRAS in cancer cell lines.
