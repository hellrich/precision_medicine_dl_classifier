In many instances however, postsurgically elevated or rising plasma calcitonin and/or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels indicate persistent metastatic disease, although conventional diagnostic procedures (computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and invasive venous catheterization) fail to localize the responsible lesions. Recently, anti-CEA antibodies and somatostatin analogs have shown promising results in the staging of MTC. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity of both methodologies, especially for the detection of occult MTC, and to assess whether there may be correlations between the scintigraphic behavior and the patients\u0027 prognosis.\nA total of 26 patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma were examined at our institution between 1977 and 1996. Ten of them had known disease, 14 had occult metastatic MTC, and 2 were free of disease at the time of presentation. Fourteen patients were investigated with anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (receiving a total of 35 injections: clones BW431/26, BW431/31, IMACIS, or F023C5, labeled with 99mTc, (111)In or (131)I), and 8 patients were studied with (111)In-labeled octreotide. Two patients received potentially therapeutic doses of (131)I-labeled anti-CEA antibodies. All patients underwent conventional radiologic evaluation (ultrasonography, CT, and MRI) and/or biopsy within 4 weeks. Additional imaging was performed with 99mTc-(V)-DMSA, (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine, 201thallium chloride, 99mTc-methylene diphosphate, and/or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Clinical follow-up was obtained.\nAll patients with established disease had elevated plasma CEA (range, 6.8-345 ng/mL; calcitonin levels between 92 and 11,497 pg/mL), whereas in 9 of 14 occult cases, levels were \u003c or \u003d 5 ng/mL (range, 0.6-829 ng/mL; calcitonin, 72-2920 pg/mL). In patients with known disease, the overall lesion-based sensitivity was 86% for the anti-CEA MAbs, whereas octreotide was unable to target any tumor in patients with rapidly progressing disease or distant metastases (overall sensitivity, 47%). In all patients with occult MTC, anti-CEA MAbs and octreotide were able to localize at least one lesion (patient-based sensitivity, virtually 100%). In patients with postsurgically persistent hypercalcitoninemia, cervical lymph nodes were identified as the most frequent site of metastases, whereas in patients with occult and slowly progressing disease several years after primary surgery, anti-CEA MAbs and octreotide showed bilateral involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes; however, tumor to nontumor ratios were usually higher with octreotide in these cases. With anti-CEA Mabs, the highest tumor to nontumor ratios were observed in clinically aggressive, rapidly progressing disease. The sensitivity of all other diagnostic modalities was, at \u003c or \u003d 50%, significantly lower. Indication for antitumor effects was observed in a patient receiving 65 mCi of (111)I-labeled F(ab\u0027)2 fragments of the clone F023C5.\nFor the detection of occult MTC, anti-CEA MAbs and octreotide seem to have a sensitivity that is superior to conventional diagnostic modalities, especially also when used in combination. Better detectability with anti-CEA antibodies (which may result in higher CEA expression) seems to be associated with more aggressively growing forms of MTC, whereas somatostatin receptor expression at normal CEA plasma levels and weaker MAb targeting may be associated with a more benign clinical course. This is in accordance with the study of Busnardo et al. (Cancer 1984; 53:278-85), who showed higher CEA serum levels to be associated with a worse prognosis, as well as with the in vitro findings of Reubi et al. (Lab Invest 1991;64:567-73), who demonstrated lower somatostatin receptor expression in less differentiated MTC.
