To explore prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers, optional tumor tissue and blood sampling was implemented for subsequent correlative research. Methods:  Tumor tissue samples were collected from 425% of the ToGA overall study population, and successfully assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PTEN (N\u003d108), IGF-1R (N\u003d106), HER3 (N\u003d126), and EGFR (N\u003d95). A total immunoreactivity score (IRS) and IRS per cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus was derived for each IHC analysis. Mutational analyses of KRAS (N\u003d87) and PIK3CA (N\u003d86) on tumor-derived DNA were explored by Sanger sequencing. Genotyping to assess polymorphisms in FcR (N\u003d130) was conducted on whole blood samples by kinetic thermocycling. All translational research data were correlated to efficacy parameters, including OS and progression-free survival. Results:  Patients expressing PTEN showed a trend toward OS benefit in the H+XP/FP arm, as indicated by an HR of 0.66 (95% CI 0.341.27). An OS benefit was gained with H+XP/FP regardless of IGF-1R levels or cutoffs applied. Data from the HER3 subgroup were difficult to interpret due to inconsistent results across cell compartments. EGFR expression levels were generally low and did not allow appropriate interpretation. Mutations known to result in constitutively active KRAS were detected in 5 samples (2 [5%] for XP/FP; 3 [6%] for H+XP/FP) in exons 2 and 3; codons 12 and 61. Activating hot spot mutations of PIK3CA were detected in 2 samples in exon 9; codons 542 and 545. As the sample size for FcR analyses was small, it was not feasible to interpret the impact of polymorphism. Conclusions:  This is the first report of exploratory biomarker panel data from a global Phase III study in HER2-positive aGC/GEJ cancer. While limited by the small number of tissue samples, observed trends are of interest for hypothesis generation and warrant further investigation.","title":"Exploratory biomarker assessment in the Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) study.","pubmedId":"ASCO_78779-102"}
