This study investigates histopathologic factors that contribute to the superior outcome of these patients.\nA retrospective review of all patients explored for periampullary neoplasms at a single institution over a 20-year period.\n291 patients with periampullary neoplasms underwent exploratory laparotomy, of which 185 had resectable tumors. Periampullary adenocarcinomas were resected in 120: pancreatic head (n\u003d74), distal common bile duct (n\u003d10), duodenum (n\u003d5), and ampulla of Vater (n\u003d31). The resection rate for non-pancreatic adenocarcinomas was 90%, while that of pancreatic cancers was 44% (p\u003c0.01). Median survival for resected non-pancreatic adenocarcinomas was 38.8 months; that of pancreatic tumors was 15.3 months (p\u003c0.01). Non-pancreatic adenocarcinomas were significantly smaller (p\u003c0.001), better differentiated (p\u003c0.001), and less likely to have involved nodes (p\u003c0.001), margins (p\u003c0.001), perineural invasion (p\u003c0.001), or vascular invasion (p\u003c0.2) than pancreatic adenocarcinomas.\nHistopathologic features of non-pancreatic periampullary adenocarcinomas significantly differentiate them from pancreatic adenocarcinoma and contribute to their relatively favorable long-term outcome following resection.","title":"Non-pancreatic periampullary adenocarcinomas: an explanation for favorable prognosis.","pubmedId":"15143931"}
