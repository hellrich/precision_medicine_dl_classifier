This type of changes has not yet been registered in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database. Molecular assessment of the KRAS mutation status in the brain metastatic site in the same patient, showed no mutations in codons 12 and 13. Moreover, we did not find mutation at exon 19 and 21 of EGFR gene, both in primary tumor as well as in secondary metastatic foci in the brain.\nThe presented case shows an example of KRAS gene molecular mosaicism and heterogeneity of lung adenocarcinoma primary and metastatic tumors. Molecular heterogeneity of lung adenocarcinoma tumors can significantly affect eligibility of patients for targeted therapies.","title":"New monoallelic combination of KRAS gene mutations in codons 12 and 13 in the lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23729630"}
