These mechanisms include the RB and/or the p53 pathway. The current model of melanomagenesis postulates that progression to immortal melanoma cells requires inactivating aberrations in signaling cascades controlling senescence. Thus, melanoma cells carrying mutant B-Raf should be resistant to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-induced senescence. Here, we demonstrate that hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway following activation of an inducible form of oncogenic C-Raf induces a senescence-like proliferation arrest in B-Raf mutant melanoma cells. This Raf-induced senescence is initially strictly dependent on MEK signaling, but seems to be independent of MAPK signaling after prolonged continuance. It is associated with reduced levels of RB phosphorylation and an increase in p21 expression, but is independent of p16(Ink4a) and p53. These data argue against the existence of fundamental changes in melanoma cells completely precluding senescence.","title":"Proliferation arrest in B-Raf mutant melanoma cell lines upon MAPK pathway activation.","pubmedId":"18650848"}
