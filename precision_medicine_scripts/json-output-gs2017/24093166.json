Estimation of the risk of recurrence with a prognostication tool and tumor mutation analysis is essential before imatinib initiation, because approximately 60% of patients with GIST with operable tumor are cured by surgery alone and some mutated tyrosine kinases are insensitive to imatinib. Adjuvant imatinib is usually administered for 3 years at the dose of 400 mg once daily. Early detection of tumors that recur despite adjuvant therapy with longitudinal imaging of the abdomen is likely beneficial.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: risk assessment and adjuvant therapy.","pubmedId":"24093166"}
