In the present study, we developed an analog BENC-511 from a recently reported PI3K inhibitor S14161 by structural optimization. Using PC3 and DU145 as the model cell lines, we found PTEN-deficient PC3 cells were more sensitive than PTEN-expressing DU145 ones in terms of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activation. These findings were consistent with the inhibition on PI3K/AKT signals. BENC-511 preferably suppressed AKT activation in PC3 over DU145 cells. Notably, PTEN restoration attenuated BENC-511 induced apoptosis. Moreover, BENC-511 displayed great therapeutic efficacy in a PC3-derived prostate cancer model in nude mice. With an oral dosage of 50mg/kg, BENC-511 decreased tumor growth more than 50% in 27 days, which was accompanied with PARP cleavage, but did not show overt toxicity. This study lays a solid rationale for the development of BENC-511 as a drug for the treatment of PTEN-deficient and androgen-independent prostate cancers.
