Choroid metastasis of breast carcinoma can be found either at presentation or in remission. It is frequently encountered in disseminated breast cancer with multiple organ metastasis. It has been proposed that the oedema-reducing effect of acetazolamide is due to stimulated ion and fluid removal from the retina to the choroid. A 40-year-old female patient on adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer was found to have an isolated choroid metastasis. Clinical and radiological remission was achieved after orbital radiotherapy, chemotherapy and acetazolamide treatment. In this case report, we emphasise the possible beneficial effect of acetazolamide in patients with choroid metastasis.","title":"The efficacy of acetazolamide on visual functions in a patient with choroid metastasis of breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11594263"}
