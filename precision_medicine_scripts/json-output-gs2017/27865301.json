Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 80% of lung cancers. The present study was designed to observe the effects and related mechanisms of resveratrol on non-small cell lung cancer in in vitro A549 cells.\nThe anticancer effects of resveratrol were analyzed on cell viability, migration and invasion, proliferation and apoptosis. Cell viability was determined by sulphorhodamine B assays. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry and migration and invasion by transwell chamber analysis. Expression of STAT-3 was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot. Overexpressing vector of STAT-3 was also constructed and transfected into A549 cells to observe the effects of resveratrol on STAT-3 signaling.\nThe results showed that resveratrol displayed a dose-dependent and time-dependent cytotoxicity action on A549 cell viability. Resveratrol also inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion and promoted apoptosis in a time-dependent manner from 0-72 hours. Further study showed that resveratrol inhibited the messenger RNA and protein expression of STAT-3, and overexpressed STAT-3 abolished the effects of resveratrol on proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion totally or in part.\nThese results suggest that the anticancer effects of resveratrol are mediated by STAT-3 signaling.","title":"Resveratrol Inhibited Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Through Inhibiting STAT-3 Signaling.","pubmedId":"27865301"}
