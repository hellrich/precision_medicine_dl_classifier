The median overall survival in patients with an NLR of \u003c or \u003d3.0 (n \u003d 55) was 13.7, 17.0 months in those with an NLR of 3.0 to 4.0 (n \u003d 17) and 5.9 months in patients with a value of \u003e4.0 (n \u003d 12) (log rank, P \u003d .016). The NLR retained its significance on multivariate analysis (P \u003d .039) along with resection margin status (P \u003d .001).\nThe preoperative NLR represents a significant independent prognostic indicator in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, whereas PLR does not.","title":"Preoperative hematologic markers as independent predictors of prognosis in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: neutrophil-lymphocyte versus platelet-lymphocyte ratio.","pubmedId":"20122680"}
