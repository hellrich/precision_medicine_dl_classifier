In this study, we determined the expression of miR-30a in human colon cancer tissues and cell lines. miR-30a was found to be significantly downregulated in both the tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-30a inhibited, while silencing of miR-30a promoted, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Consistently, stable overexpression of miR-30a suppressed the growth of colon cancer cell xenografts in vivo. Moreover, bioinformatic algorithms and luciferase reporter assays revealed that insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) is a direct target of miR-30a. Further functional studies suggested that repression of IRS2 by miR-30a partially mediated the tumor suppressor effect of miR-30a. In addition, miR-30a inhibited constitutive phosphorylation of Akt by targeting IRS2. Additionally, clinicopathological analysis indicated that miR-30a has an inverse correlation with the staging in patients with colon cancer. Taken together, our study provides the first evidence that miR-30a suppressed colon cancer cell growth through inhibition of IRS2. Thus, miR-30a might serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for colon cancer treatment.
