However, patients invariably develop acquired resistance to ALK inhibitors. Although the recent functional genetic studies characterized the mechanism of resistance to ALK inhibition, epigenetic mechanism of acquired resistance is poorly understood.Method: We established in vivo and in vitro models of acquired resistance to ceritinib and crizotinib using H3122 and H2228 cells. For in vivo model, mice with established H3122-derived tumors were treated with ceritinib to derive ceritinib-resistant tumors. To investigate the epigenetic mechanisms of resistance, we performed methylated DNA binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq) for DNA methylation and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications associated with enhancers (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) of H3122 and H3122 ceritinib-resistant (LR) cells. We also performed in situ hybridization of miR-34 and miR-449 in patient samples.Results: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with AXL activation was found in multiple in vitro and in vivo ALK-rearranged lung cancer models with acquired resistance to ceritinib. Genome and epigenome-wide analysis identified that miR-34a and miR-449a are decreased with loss of H3K27ac, while AXL and mesenchymal genes are increased in the process of acquired resistance. We confirmed that miR-34a and miR-449 were involved in AXL-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by treating mimics and inhibitors of miR-34a and miR-449a. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of AXL or ectopic expression of miR-34a or miR-449a restored sensitivity to ceritinib in H3122-LR cells. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat, synergistically induced anti-proliferative effects with ceritinib in resistant cells. Treatment with panobinostat led to increased expression of miR-449a with increased H3K28ac signal in H3122 LR cells. Panobinostat also reversed EMT phenotype by downregulating N-cadherin and upregulating E-cadherin expression. Additionally, combination of panobinostat and ceritinib induced enhanced antitumor efficacy in acquired resistant xenograft models. To clinically validate our preclinical findings, we measured the expression of miR-34a and miR-449 by in situ hybridization in 5 matched ALK-rearranged lung cancers obtained from individuals both before and after ALK inhibitor treatment. We detected decreased expression of miR-34a and miR-449 in 3 of 5 samples (60%).Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that H3K27ac remodeling is a crucial event in ceritinib resistance and inhibition of both ALK and HDAC could prevent or overcome acquired resistance to ALK inhibitors in individuals with ALK-rearranged lung cancer.","title":"Epigenetic downregulation of miRNA-34a and miRNA-449 induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and acquired resistance to ceritinib.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-3346"}
