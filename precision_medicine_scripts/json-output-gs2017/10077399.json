LA appendage ejection fraction calculated as (LA appendage maximal area)-(LA appendage minimal area)/(LA appendage maximal area) x 100 was also determined in these patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was recorded during cardiac catheterization performed within 24 h of echocardiographic study.\nLeft ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 2 to 47 mm Hg. There were close negative correlations of LA appendage emptying velocity (r\u003d-0.508; P\u003c0.01), filling velocity (r\u003d-0.429; P\u003c0.05) and LA appendage ejection fraction (r\u003d-0.523; P\u003c0.005) with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. LA appendage active emptying velocity \u003c30 cm/s predicted left ventricular end-diastolic pressure \u003e25 mm Hg with a sensitivity of 72.7%, a specificity of 92.9% and a positive and negative predictive value of 88.9 and 81.3%.\nThe findings suggest that measurement of LA appendage blood flow velocities and contractile function by transesophageal echocardiography can be used to predict elevated left ventricular filling pressure in patients with congestive heart failure.","title":"Decreased left atrial appendage function is an important predictor of elevated left ventricular filling pressure in patients with congestive heart failure.","pubmedId":"10077399"}
