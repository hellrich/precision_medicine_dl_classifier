We assessed 22 TagSNPs, selected based on pairwise r(2) \u003e95%, using the Haploview Tagger and genotyped the TagSNPs on the Illumina GoldenGate or Sequenom platforms. The association between single nucleotide polymorphisms and colorectal cancer was assessed using log-additive, codominant, and recessive models.\nFrom studying the population-based families, the C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) polymorphisms were associated with a decreased colorectal cancer risk overall [odds ratio (OR), 0.81; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.63-1.04; and OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64-1.07, respectively]. The 677 TT genotype was associated with a decreased risk of microsatellite-stable/microsatellite-low tumors (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49-0.97) and an increased risk of microsatellite-high tumors (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 0.91-5.43; P(interaction) \u003d 0.01), as well as an increased risk of proximal cancers and a decreased risk of distal and rectal cancers (P(interaction) \u003d 0.02). No other single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with risk overall or within subgroups.\nThe 677 TT and 1298 CC genotypes may each be associated with a decrease in colorectal cancer risk. We observed little evidence of additional genetic variability in the MTHFR gene relevant to colorectal cancer risk.","title":"Genetic variability in the MTHFR gene and colorectal cancer risk using the colorectal cancer family registry.","pubmedId":"20056627"}
