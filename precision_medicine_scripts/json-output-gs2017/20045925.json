Colorectal cancer epigenetics is evolved in DNA methylation which is associated with the activation of oncogene and inactivation of tumor suppressor gene. The potential reversibility of DNA methylation offers exciting opportunities for therapy and diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma.","title":"[Colorectal carcinoma and DNA methylation].","pubmedId":"20045925"}
