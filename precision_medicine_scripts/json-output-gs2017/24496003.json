Expression array, RNA-Seq, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and direct sequencing were then conducted to confirm the rearrangements and to identify the novel fusion partner in the xenograft and/or the primary patient tumor. Finally, pharmacological studies were performed in PDX models to evaluate their responses to ALK inhibitor crizotinib.\nTwo ALK-rearranged NSCLC PDX models were identified: one carried a well-known EML4-ALK variant 3a/b and the other harbored a novel huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1)-ALK fusion gene. Exon 28 of the HIP1 gene located on chromosome 7 was fused to exon 20 of the ALK gene located on chromosome 2. Both cases were clinically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma. Compared with the other lung cancer PDX models, both ALK-rearranged models displayed elevated ALK mRNA expression. Furthermore, in vivo efficacy studies demonstrated that, similar to the EML4-ALK-positive model, the HIP1-ALK-containing PDX model was sensitive to treatment with crizotinib.\nDiscovery of HIP1 as a fusion partner of ALK in NSCLC is a novel finding. In addition, the HIP1-ALK-rearranged tumor is sensitive to treatment with crizotinib in vivo, implicating HIP1-ALKas an oncogenic driver of lung tumorigenesis. Collectively, our results indicate that HIP1-ALK-positive NSCLC may benefit from clinical applications of crizotinib.","title":"HIP1-ALK, a novel ALK fusion variant that responds to crizotinib.","pubmedId":"24496003"}
