The objective of this study was to determine the global trends in incidence of cardiac and non-cardiac gastric cancer. Ninety two high quality registries with the proportion of Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) gastric cancer (ICD-10 code C16.8-9) below 50% and the total number of gastric cancer cases above 300 were selected from 225 registries in Cancer Incidence of Five Continent (CI5) volume 9 and 262 registries from CI5 volume 10. The NOS cases were re-distributed to cardia and non-cardia according to the registry-specific proportion. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) per 100,000 population and incidence rate ratios (IRR) from 1998-2002 to 2003-2007 were calculated. Non-cardia cancer incidence was significantly decreased in 5 out of 10 Asian registries, 17 out of 18 European registries, 27 out of 56 North American registries, and all 5 Oceanian registries in men. Only two registries in Asia showed a significant increase in non-cardia cancer incidence. In contrast, cardia cancer significantly increased in one Asian registry, two European registries, and two North American registries. Significant decrease in cardia cancer was observed in 3 Asian registries, 6 European registries, 11 North American registries, and 3 Oceanian registries in men. In women, six registries (1 Asian, 2 European, and 3 North American) showed significant increase in non-cardia cancer, whereas registries 25 (3 Asian, 13 European, 8 North American, and 1 Oceanian) showed significant decrease in non-cardia cancer incidence. Cardia cancer in women increased in 16 registries (2 Asian and 14 North American) and decreased in 9 registries (1 Asian, 5 European, and 3 North American). In conclusion, non-cardia cancer incidence decreased in most registries, whereas decrease in cardia cancer is more prominent in men but not in women.","title":"Global transition in cardia and non-cardia gastric cancer incidence, 1998-2007.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-265"}
