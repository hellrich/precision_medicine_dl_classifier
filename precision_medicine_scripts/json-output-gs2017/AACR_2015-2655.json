Categorization of cells was performed by unsupervised clustering of quantile normalized IC50 values. RNA sequencing was performed using the ScriptSeqv2 mRNA-Seq kit, Illumina HiSeq 2000, and Partek software. Functional evaluation was performed by lentivirus modulation and standard phenotypic analyses. Six patient-derived PIK3CA wildtype gastric tumor xenograft models (PDXs) were also evaluated for sensitivity to PI3K inhibition and candidate expression.Results: Unsupervised clustering revealed two subgroups, comprising 3 resistant and 5 sensitive cell lines. Among differentially expressed genes, IGFBP3 had the highest overexpression (67-fold) in sensitive cells. IGFBP3 encodes insulin growth factor binding protein 3, which sequesters insulin growth factor (IGF) from binding to its receptor (IGF-1R). The sequestration of IGF by IGFBP3 may repress alternative activation of PI3K pathways through IGF signaling. Consistent with this, overexpression of IGFBP3 increased cell sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors and was accompanied by reduced IGF-1R, Akt and S6 phosphorylation and increased G1 arrest. IGFBP3 expression was also significantly higher in PDXs responsive to PI3K inhibitors than in those resistant.Conclusions: High IGFBP3 may be a useful biomarker of sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors in PIK3CA wildtype gastric tumor cells.","title":"Determinants of sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors in PIK3CA wildtype gastric tumor cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2655"}
