Hemocytometric counts and [3H]-thymidine incorporation were used to determine the effects of quercetin, EGF and TGF-alpha on cell proliferation and DNA synthesis in PC-3 and LnCap cells. Changes in ErbB-2, ErbB-3 and components of MAPK and PI-3K pathways were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Treatment of PC-3 and LnCap cells with quercetin resulted in a dose-dependent growth inhibition. The rate of DNA synthesis was decreased by 40, 55 and 65% on treatment with 14.5, 29.0 and 58.0 microM of quercetin, respectively. Concomitantly, these treatments led to a dose-dependent decrease in ErbB-2, ErbB-3 and their basal autophosphorylation levels as compared to controls. Cyclin D1 expression and basal phosphorylation of c-Raf, MAPK, Elk-1 and Akt-1 in PC-3 cells was also inhibited by quercetin treatment. Co-treating PC-3 cells with quercetin significantly attenuated EGF- and TGF-alpha-induced growth and phosphorylation of ErbB-2, ErbB-3, c-Raf, MAPK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), MAPK, Elk-1 and Akt-1. Since ErbB receptor is important for growth, metastasis and drug resistance, inhibition of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 by pharmacological doses of quercetin may provide a new approach for treatment of prostate cancers.","title":"Inhibition of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 expression by quercetin prevents transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha)- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced human PC-3 prostate cancer cell proliferation.","pubmedId":"12888923"}
