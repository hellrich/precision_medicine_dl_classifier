Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1), an activator protein (AP-1) coactivator, previously implicated in p27 degradation, is overexpressed in various tumors and correlates with low p27 expression. We examined JAB1 and p27 in normal and neoplastic pancreatic tissues. Increased JAB1 expression was seen in pancreatic carcinoma samples but not in paired normal pancreatic tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis using tissue microarrays showed that JAB1 was overexpressed in all 32 (100%) pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples tested, predominantly nuclear in 23 (72%) samples and predominantly cytoplasmic in 9 (28%) tumors. When 10% was used as a cutoff for p27 positivity, p27 was expressed in 11 (34%) of tumors; however, p27 expression was localized in the nuclei of tumor cells in only 4 (13%) of the samples. Overexpression of the JAB1 in the pancreatic carcinoma cell lines Panc-1, Mia PaCa-2, and Panc-28 resulted in decreased p27 expression. Conversely, down-regulation of JAB1 by short interfering RNA substantially increased p27 expression and inhibited progression from G(1) to S phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, JAB1-mediated p27 degradation was not impaired when S-phase kinase-interacting protein 2 (Skp2), an F-box protein required for the ubiquitination and consequent degradation of p27, was silenced. Thus, JAB1 may have an Skp2-independent p27 degradation mechanism in pancreatic cancer cells. These findings suggest that JAB1 overexpression is involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer through JAB1-mediated p27 degradation and that control of JAB1 expression is a novel therapeutic target in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas.","title":"Potential role of Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 as a negative regulator of p27kip1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"16951171"}
