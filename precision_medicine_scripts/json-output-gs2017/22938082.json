The objective of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics and prognosis of childhood high-grade meningiomas.\nTwenty-three patients with childhood high-grade meningiomas were treated at the Huashan Hospital. Clinical data were collected, tumor samples were reexamined, and prognoses were attained through follow-up visits and telephone interviews. Survival probability was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A 2-sided probability level of 0.05 was chosen for statistical significance.\nThe series included 18 males and 5 females (mean age 12.1 years). The most common symptoms were headache and vomiting (43%). Three patients had accompanying neurofibromatosis type II (NF2). The high-grade meningioma cases with NF2 had larger tumor diameters than those without NF2 (p \u003d 0.010). The skull base was the most common tumor site (39%). Complete resections were achieved in 11 patients after their initial operations. Adjuvant radiation therapy was performed in 9 cases. Follow-up evaluations were performed for 20 patients (mean follow-up 70 months). Ten patients experienced recurrences, 2 patients had lung metastases, and 7 patients died of the recurrence. The extent of surgery was significantly related to progression-free survival (PFS; p \u003d 0.038). A negative progesterone receptor combined with strongly positive Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was significantly related to PFS (p \u003d 0.001) and overall survival (p \u003d 0.002). The MIB-1 labeling index was significantly related to overall survival (p \u003d 0.018), whereas postoperative radiation therapy was not significantly related to PFS (p \u003d 0.087) and overall survival (p \u003d 0.40).\nChildhood high-grade meningioma is a rare tumor type. Childhood high-grade meningioma has a male predominance and the basilar region is the most common tumor location. Patients with these tumors have high recurrence and mortality rates. The extent of resection is an important prognosis factor. A negative progesterone receptor combined with a strongly positive Bcl-2 immunoreaction might predict cancer recurrence. The MIB-1 labeling index correlates with the prognosis, and an MIB-1 labeling index \u003e 3% increases the risk of recurrence in childhood high-grade meningioma. More cases should be collected, and longer follow-up periods should be obtained, to evaluate the effects of postoperative radiation therapy in childhood high-grade meningioma.","title":"Clinical features and treatment of World Health Organization grade II and III meningiomas in childhood: report of 23 cases.","pubmedId":"22938082"}
