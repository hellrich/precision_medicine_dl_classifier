There is a large and continually growing body of evidence regarding the importance of this mutation in targeted therapy for melanoma. In this review, we outline these findings including: molecular pathways used by BRAF, the importance in nonmalignant neoplasms, histologic associations, the relationship of BRAF to KIT and NRAS mutations, and their impact on survival, as well as resistance mechanisms to BRAF inhibitors employed by melanoma. Understanding these topics and how they relate to one another may facilitate the development of new treatments and eventually improve the prognosis for those patients afflicted with this disease.","title":"Towards personalized therapy for patients with malignant melanoma: molecular insights into the biology of BRAF mutations.","pubmedId":"23414474"}
