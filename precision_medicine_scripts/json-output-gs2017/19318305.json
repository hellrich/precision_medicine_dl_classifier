Concurrent chemo-radiation is only considered as the standard treatment of advanced cervix carcinomas. There is some evidence in favor of its clinical interest in management of locally advanced vulva carcinoma and for improvement of the prognostic of aggressive endometrial cancers. The interest of pharmacological modulation of radiation is re-emerging in treatment of cervix carcinoma because of the efficacy of combined chemo-radiation in terms of local control and overall survival. No data are currently available for the assessment of the clinical impact of targeted therapies.","title":"[Association of radiotherapy and chemotherapy: targeted therapies in gynecological cancers].","pubmedId":"19318305"}
