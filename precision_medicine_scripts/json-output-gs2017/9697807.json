We discuss dialysis-associated priapism and the effects of erythropoietin on the coagulation cascade and male hormone levels in an effort to elucidate the etiology of priapism in this patient.","title":"Erythropoietin-induced recurrent veno-occlusive priapism associated with end-stage renal disease.","pubmedId":"9697807"}
