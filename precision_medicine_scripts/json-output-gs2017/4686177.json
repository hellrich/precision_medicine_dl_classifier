The response was dependent upon the immunogenicity of the treated tumour so that in comparison, intravenous injection of BCG enhanced rather than suppressed pulmonary growths of transferred cells of several weakly immunogenic tumours including a spontaneously arising sarcoma and an epithelioma as well as a carcinogen-induced mammary carcinoma.","title":"BCG immunotherapy of pulmonary growths from intravenously transferred rat tumour cells.","pubmedId":"4686177"}
