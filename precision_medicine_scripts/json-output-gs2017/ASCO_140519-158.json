The choice is currently made by the clinicians according to awaited toxicity and association with targeted therapy. The correlation between response to chemotherapy (oxaliplatin and irinotecan containing regimens) and genomic alterations was investigated in metastatic colorectal cancer patients included in the ProfiLER protocol (NCT 02029001).  Methods:  From 03/2013 to 03/2014, 62 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were included in the ProfiLER trial. Tumor samples were analyzed for mutations/insertions/deletions and copy number variations using target high-throughput sequencing (NGS) and comparative genomic hybridization array (CGH). Clinical data were collected retrospectively. We defined irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin responders as patients having CR, PR, SD as best response and non-responders as those having PD as best response.  Results:  50/62 tumor samples fulfilled DNA quality requirements. CGH was feasible in 40 patients (64.5%). Among these 40 patients, 36 received oxaliplatin and irinotecan. None of the genomic alterations correlated to response to oxaliplatin. Conversely, analysis of the CGH and NGS data revealed different genomic alterations of tumors in patients receiving Irinotecan, allowing the separation between Irinotecan responders (IriR, n\u003d27) and non-responders (IriNR, n\u003d9) (Table).  Conclusions:  Specific genomic alterations of CRC cells seem to be associated with responses to systemic combination Irinotecan based-chemotherapy, including high GI, specific chromosomal gains, and tyrosine kinases mutations. A prospective validation of the CGH profile is planned and definitive results will be presented at the meeting.
