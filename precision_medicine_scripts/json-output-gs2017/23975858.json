KRAS codon 12 mutations were analysed in normal lung and lymph node tissue, primary lung tumours and metastatic lymph nodes using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. HLA class I antigen immunostaining was examined using flow cytometry.\nA total of 65 patients participated in the study. All normal lung tissues had positive HLA class I antigen immunostaining. The majority of primary lung tumours (56/65) and all of the metastatic lymph nodes (31/31) had downregulated HLA class I antigen immunostaining. There was a positive correlation between downregulated HLA class I antigen in primary tumours and metastatic lymph nodes. There was a negative correlation between KRAS codon 12 mutations and the level of HLA class I antigen in primary and metastatic tumours.\nKRAS codon 12 mutations appear to be important in the downregulation of HLA class I antigen in NSCLC. Abnormal activation of the oncogenic KRAS pathway might provide a new treatment target for NSCLC.","title":"The relationship between KRAS gene mutations and HLA class I antigen downregulation in the metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23975858"}
