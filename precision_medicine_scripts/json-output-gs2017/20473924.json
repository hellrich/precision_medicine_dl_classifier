MicroRNAs are deregulated in most cancers, including neuroblastoma. In this study, we analysed 430 miRNAs in 69 neuroblastomas by stem-loop RT-qPCR. Prediction of event-free survival (EFS) with support vector machines (SVM) and actual survival times with Cox regression-based models (CASPAR) were highly accurate and were independently validated. SVM-accuracy for prediction of EFS was 88.7% (95% CI: 88.5-88.8%). For CASPAR-based predictions, 5y-EFS probability was 0.19% (95% CI: 0-38%) in the CASPAR-predicted short survival group compared with 0.78% (95%CI: 64-93%) in the CASPAR-predicted long survival group. Both classifiers were validated on an independent test set yielding accuracies of 94.74% (SVM) and 5y-EFS probabilities as 0.25 (95% CI: 0.0-0.55) for short versus 1 Â± 0.0 for long survival (CASPAR), respectively. Amplification of the MYCN oncogene was highly correlated with deregulation of miRNA expression. In addition, 37 miRNAs correlated with TrkA expression, a marker of excellent outcome, and 6 miRNAs further analysed in vitro were regulated upon TrkA transfection, suggesting a functional relationship. Expression of the most significant TrkA-correlated miRNA, miR-542-5p, also discriminated between local and metastatic disease and was inversely correlated with MYCN amplification and event-free survival. We conclude that neuroblastoma patient outcome prediction using miRNA expression is feasible and effective. Studies testing miRNA-based predictors in comparison to and in combination with mRNA and aCGH information should be initiated. Specific miRNAs (e.g., miR-542-5p) might be important in neuroblastoma tumour biology, and qualify as potential therapeutic targets.","title":"Accurate prediction of neuroblastoma outcome based on miRNA expression profiles.","pubmedId":"20473924"}
