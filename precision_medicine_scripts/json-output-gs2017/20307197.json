Yet, levels of K-RAS mutation in normal and pathological tissue samples have not been determined rigorously, nor inter-individual variation in these levels characterized. Therefore, K-RAS codon 12 GAT and GTT mutant fractions were measured in colonic mucosa of individuals without colon cancer, tumor-distal mucosa, tumor-proximal mucosa, normal tumor-adjacent tissues, colonic adenomas, and carcinomas. The results indicate K-RAS codon 12 GAT mutation is present at measurable levels in normal appearing mucosa. All tumors carried K-RAS mutation, in most cases as a mutant subpopulation.","title":"ACB-PCR quantification of K-RAS codon 12 GAT and GTT mutant fraction in colon tumor and non-tumor tissue.","pubmedId":"20307197"}
