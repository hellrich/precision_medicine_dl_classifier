Progression free survival and overall survival in patients with high-grade metastatic colon cancer were not improved by the addition of irinotecan or oxaliplatin to the infusional 5-fluorouracil + leucovorin regimen.\nHistological grade is a prognostic factor in stage III/IV colon cancer but not in stage I/II. Oxaliplatin and irinotecan may not enhance the efficacy of infusional 5-fluorouracil + leucovorin in the treatment of high-grade metastatic colon cancer.","title":"The efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with high-grade metastatic colon cancer.","pubmedId":"21940314"}
