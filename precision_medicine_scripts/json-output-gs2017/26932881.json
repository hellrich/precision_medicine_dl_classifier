The incidence of gastric cancer is the 5(th) of all the malignancies, and the mortality is the 3(rd). The type and resection area of gastric cancer surgery have changed a lot. D2 lymph node dissection is recommended for locally advanced gastric cancer. Prophylactic pancreatectomy or splenectomy is not necessary for radical resection. Indication of minimally invasive surgery is confined to early gastric cancer with distal gastrectomy. Less extensive approach of early stage cases is suitable, and application of sentinel lymph node is a potential method. Meanwhile, the development of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy during the perioperative period also improved the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Recently, the development of molecular biology, such as the maturity of the new generation sequencing approach, started a new era of precision treatment for gastric cancer.
