Phospho-PRAS40(Thr246) correlated positively with lymph node metastasis, lymphatic infiltration, vascular infiltration and shorter survival. Furthermore, phospho-PRAS40(Thr246) is an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer.\nOur data suggest that phospho-PRAS40(Thr246) was frequently expressed in gastric cancers, and correlated with malignant progression and poor prognosis of patients. PI3K pathway-targeted therapies should be considered in the future treatment of gastric cancers.","title":"Prognostic role of phospho-PRAS40 (Thr246) expression in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"24701227"}
