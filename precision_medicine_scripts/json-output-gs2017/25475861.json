Because of the rarity of this tumor, its feature is poorly understood. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological features and long-term prognosis of patients with cHCC-CC after surgery and to compare with those of the patients with stage-matched HCC and CC.\nThe clinicopathological features of the patients who underwent surgery for cHCC-CC at our center during the period of 2001-2010 were retrospectively analyzed and compared with those of stage-matched HCC and CC patients. Cancer staging was performed according to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (6th ed.). Overall survival and disease-free survival were compared among the groups and prognostic factors of cHCC-CC were evaluated.\nSignificant differences were observed in clinicopathological features among 42 patients with cHCC-CC, 90 patients with HCC and 45 patients with CC. Similar to HCC patients, cHCC-CC patients had frequent hepatitis B virus antigen positivity, microscopic vessel invasion, cirrhosis and high level of serum alpha-fetoprotein. Similar to CC patients, cHCC-CC patients showed increased bile duct invasion and decreased capsule. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with cHCC-CC were not significantly different from those with stage-matched patients with CC; but significantly poorer than those with HCC. In subanalysis of patients with stage II, the overall survival in patients with cHCC-CC or CC was significantly poorer than that in patients with HCC. We did not find the difference in patients with other stages. Univariate analysis of overall and disease-free survival of patients with cHCC-CC showed that the vascular invasion and intrahepatic metastasis were the significant predictive factors.\nPatients with cHCC-CC showed similar clinicopathological features as those with HCC or CC, and patients with cHCC-CC or CC had a poorer prognosis compared with those with HCC, especially at matched stage II.","title":"Clinicopathological features and prognosis of combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma after surgery.","pubmedId":"25475861"}
