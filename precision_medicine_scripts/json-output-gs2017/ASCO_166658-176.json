In resectable GC, multimodal approach is the standard of care but its choice and feasibility in unknown in older pts. The aim is to assess the choice and feasibility of the whole strategy in this population in real-life setting. Methods: Consecutive pts age  70 yrs with resectable GC (including oesogastric junction) and eligible for curative treatment were retrospectively included in three teaching hospitals from 2007 to 2014. Endpoints were initial treatment choice and feasibility measured by : optimal treatment completion defined as surgery with perioperative treatment or surgery followed by adjuvant treatment or surgery alone for stage I ; CTCAE grade 3-4 toxicities and post-operative complications. Associated factors were identified by uni and multivariate analysis. Results: 189 consecutive pts (median age 77yrs (70-95)) were included. 45.7% had peri-operative strategy, 9.2% surgery with adjuvant treatment, 27.2% surgery alone (including 28% stage I), and 17.9% systemic treatment alone. Overall, optimal treatment was performed in 47%. 53.9% had post-operative complications and 30.8% had grade 3/4 toxicities. By multivariate analysis, age  80 yrs was associated with less likely perioperative treatment choice (p \u003d 0.009). Increase age (p \u003d 0.01), depressive mood (p \u003d 0.04) and not-living at their personal home (p \u003d 0.03) were independently associated with less likely optimal treatment. Number of severe comorbidities (p \u003d 0.04), medications (p \u003d 0.03) and oesogastric junction location (p \u003d 0.001) were independently associated with post-operative complications. Independent associated factors for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments non completion were malnutrition (p \u003d 0.04), referral for a geriatric assessment (p \u003d 0.01) and anemia (p \u003d 0.01). Conclusions: Optimal multimodal treatment for GC is feasible for older pts but post-operative morbidity and treatment toxicities are frequent and should not be underestimated. Chronological age influenced the choice of treatment plan whereas several geriatric factors are associated with feasibility.","title":"Multimodal treatment choice and feasibility in older patients with resectable gastric cancer: a multicentric cohort study.","pubmedId":"ASCO_166658-176"}
