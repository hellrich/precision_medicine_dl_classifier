Hypopigmented or erythematous macules on the face of older women, resembling Bowen\u0027s disease or eczema, are the most common clinical presentation. We report a case of ALMM in a 73-year-old woman. Therapeutic trials with cryotherapy, 5-fluorouracil, and azelaic acid were unsuccessful, and the lesions were eventually cured by surgical excision. ALMM requires early clinical suspicion and histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis in every patient presenting with a slowly enlarging erythematous or hypopigmented macule, especially when located on the face of an older woman with a light complexion.","title":"Amelanotic lentigo maligna melanoma: report of a case and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"10431675"}
