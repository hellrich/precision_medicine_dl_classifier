Further advances have been achieved with the integration of targeted agents such as bevacizumab, cetuximab and recently, panitumumab. As a result, third-line treatment is now a necessary step in the optimal treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC).\nWe conducted a literature review of English language publications on third-line therapy for MCRC from January 2000 to April 2007. Data on median overall survival (mOS), median time to progression (mTTP) and response rate were recorded.\nWe found 27 articles and 22 abstracts to fulfil the criteria. Patients who received regimens containing oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) demonstrated mTTP up to 7 months and a mOS of 16 months. With irinotecan and 5-FU, mOS around 8 months were reported and with cetuximab combined with irinotecan, the highest mOS was 9.8 months.\nThird-line therapy in advanced colorectal cancer may improve mOS for patients with MCRC. Therefore, randomized studies should be conducted in the future.","title":"Third-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"17786445"}
