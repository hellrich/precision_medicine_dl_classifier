This is starting to change, as new studies have shown positive effect on overall survival in the second line setting. At the recent ASCO Annual Meeting 2014, several new second-line chemotherapy regimens were presented, including ruxolitinib with capecitabine, oxaliplatin with 5-FU/leucovorin, metformin plus paclitaxel and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. These abstracts provide exciting new directions for the second line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer that has been refractory to both gemcitabine-based regimens as well as non-gemcitabine based regimens.","title":"Second-line treatment for pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"25076339"}
