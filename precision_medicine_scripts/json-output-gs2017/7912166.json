To investigate the role of HER2/neu in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we established autologous tumor-specific CTL from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of HLA-A2+ HER2/neu+ NSCLC patients. These CTL lines specifically recognized HLA-A2+ HER2/neu+ autologous and allogeneic NSCLC cell lines as well as HLA-A2+ HER2/neu+ heterologous ovarian cancer cell lines. Furthermore, these CTL recognized an overexpressed, HER2/neu-derived peptide. From these results, we conclude that HLA-A2 serves as a restriction element in NSCLC. More importantly, at least one HER2/neu-derived peptide is a tumor-associated antigen in NSCLC and ovarian cancer.","title":"HER2/neu-derived peptides are shared antigens among human non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer.","pubmedId":"7912166"}
