However, controversy remains regarding the indications for up-front surgery according to the degree of venous involvement.\nFrom 2004 to 2009, 1,399 patients included in a French multicenter survey underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, either without VR (997 standard resections [SR]) or with VR (402 patients; 29 %). Postoperative and long-term outcomes were compared in both groups.\nVR was associated with the following factors: larger tumors (p \u003c 0.001), poorly differentiated tumors (p \u003d 0.004), higher numbers of positive lymph nodes (p \u003d 0.042), and positive resection margins (R1; p \u003c 0.001). Overall, VR increased neither postoperative morbidity nor postoperative mortality (5 vs. 3 % in SR patients; p \u003d 0.16). The median and 3-year survival rates in VR patients versus SR patients were 21 months and 31 % vs. 29 months and 44 %, respectively (p \u003d 0.0002). In the entire cohort, multivariate analysis identified VR as a significant poor prognostic factor for long-term survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.75, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.28-2.40; p \u003d 0.0005). In the VR patients, lymph node ratio, whatever the cutoff (\u003c0.3: p \u003d 0.093; ≥ 0.3: p \u003d 0.0098), R1 resection (p \u003d 0.010), and segmental resection (p \u003d 0.016) were independent risk factors; neoadjuvant treatment (HR 0.52, 95 % CI 0.29-0.94; p \u003d 0.031) and adjuvant treatment (HR 0.55, 95 % CI 0.35-0.85; p \u003d 0.006) were significantly associated with improved long-term survival.\nLong-term survival after pancreatectomy was significantly altered when up-front VR was performed. Neoadjuvant treatment may be a better strategy than up-front resection in patients with preoperative suspicion of venous involvement.","title":"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with venous involvement: is up-front synchronous portal-superior mesenteric vein resection still justified?
