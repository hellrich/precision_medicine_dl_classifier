The aim of this study was to compare the association of BRAF V600E mutation in interval versus non-interval colorectal cancers and to determine the relationship between BRAF mutation and 5-year survival.\nWe searched our institution\u0027s cancer registry for interval cancers, defined as colon cancers that developed within 5 years of a complete colonoscopy. These were frequency matched to patients with non-interval cancers. Archived cancer specimens were tested for BRAF V600E mutation and MSI.\nThere were 63 interval and 131 non-interval cancers. BRAF mutation was present in 28% of interval cancers compared to 19% of non-interval cancers (P \u003d 0.18). In a multivariable logistic regression model, proximal location (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.01-3.8) and MSI (OR 2.7; 95% 1.1-6.8) were independently associated with interval cancers while BRAF mutation was not (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.36-2.38). BRAF mutation portended a poor 5-year survival, particularly among microsatellite stable cancers.\nBRAF mutation is not associated with interval cancers but is a marker of poor prognosis, particularly in microsatellite stable cancers.","title":"Is BRAF mutation associated with interval colorectal cancers?","pubmedId":"20300843"}
