Progress will be based on a detailed understanding of molecular mechanisms responsible for tumor progression. An interesting study by Jang and colleagues evaluated and compared the frequency of amplification of four oncogenes (HER2, c-MYC, CCND1 and FGFR1) in large cohorts of pure DCIS, in the DCIS component of IBC, and in corresponding IBC. Of particular interest, they found a twofold increase in FGFR1 amplification in IBC versus pure DCIS, and significantly reduced disease-free survival in amplified versus unamplified IBC - leading the authors to conclude that FGFR1 plays an important role in the development and progression of IBC. These observations indeed provide hints that FGFR1 is important in this setting, although the issue is very complex and far from resolved.
