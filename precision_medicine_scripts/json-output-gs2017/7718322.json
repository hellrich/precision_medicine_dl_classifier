The EGFr expression was evaluated by immunocytochemical assay using a monoclonal antibody which recognises the external domain of the receptor. EGFr immunoreactivity was significantly higher in squamous than in non-squamous cell carcinomas (P \u003d 0.0009). Hilar and/or mediastinal nodal involvement was found in 29 of 105 (27.4%) squamous cancers, and in this group of patients, the mean of EGFr positive cells was significantly higher than that of patients without nodal involvement (P \u003d 0.01). No significant correlations were found between the expression of EGFr and other clinicopathological or biological parameters such as T-status, grading, proliferative activity. EGFR is suggested to represent a useful indicator of nodal metastasis in NSCLC.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) expression in non-small cell lung carcinomas correlates with metastatic involvement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes in the squamous subtype.","pubmedId":"7718322"}
