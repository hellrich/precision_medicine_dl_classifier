Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the distribution of the most common KRAS and BRAF mutations in Greek patients with colorectal cancer and their possible associations with clinical histopathological parameters. In this study, 322 and 188 colorectal carcinomas were used for the mutation analysis of KRAS (exon 2) and BRAF (exon 15) genes, respectively. The mutational status of both genes was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. Although the overall frequency of KRAS mutations (36.6%) seemed to be similar to those reported for other populations, the rate of point mutations at codon 13 was significantly lower (12%) in Greek patients with colorectal cancer and associated with male gender (P \u003c 0.05). Tumors with G\u003eT codon 12 transversions and G\u003eC transitions showed more frequent lymph node metastasis (P \u003c 0.05, P \u003c 0.005, respectively). The rate of KRAS mutations gradually decreased with increasing histological grade (P \u003c 0.05), as opposed to BRAF mutations, which were strongly associated with poorly differentiated tumors (P \u003c 0.005). Additionally, we found that the histological features of preexisting adenoma were associated with the absence of BRAF mutations, in contrast to KRAS (P \u003c 0.05). Our data suggested that there seems to be a correlation between morphological criteria and discrete genetic pathways in colorectal carcinogenesis. Moreover, ethnic or geographic factors may have an impact on genetic background of colorectal carcinomas, and specific types of KRAS mutations may influence the metastatic potential of colorectal tumors.
