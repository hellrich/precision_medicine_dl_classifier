Its application in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is only justified in clinical studies, since there is no evidence of its efficacy. In small cell lung cancer (SCLC) chemotherapy is supplemented by local therapy regimens like radiotherapy and/or surgery. At present clinical studies are examining whether chemotherapy should be applied before or after surgical treatment.","title":"[Bronchial cancer--adjuvant chemotherapy].","pubmedId":"1983675"}
