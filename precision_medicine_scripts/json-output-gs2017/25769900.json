However, compared with tissue testing, the sensitivity of plasma testing is not yet satisfactory because of the highly fragmented nature of plasma cell-free DNA, low fraction of tumor DNA, and limitations of available detection technologies. We therefore developed a highly sensitive and specific droplet digital PCR method for plasma EGFR mutation (exon19 deletions and L858R) testing. Plasma from 86 EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naive lung cancer patients was tested and compared with EGFR mutation status of matched tumor tissues tested by amplification refractory mutation system. By using EGFR mutation-positive cell DNA, we optimized the droplet digital PCR assays to reach 0.04% sensitivity. The plasma testing sensitivity and specificity, compared with the matched tumor tissues tested by amplification refractory mutation system, were 81.82% (95% CI, 59.72%-94.81%) and 98.44% (95% CI, 91.60%-99.96%), respectively, for exon19 deletions, with 94.19% concordance rate (κ \u003d 0.840; 95% CI, 0.704-0.976; P \u003c 0.0001), whereas they were 80.00% (95% CI, 51.91%-95.67%) and 95.77% (95% CI, 88.14%-99.12%), respectively, for L858R, with 93.02% concordance rate (κ \u003d 0.758; 95% CI, 0.571-0.945; P \u003c 0.0001). The reported highly sensitive and specific droplet digital PCR assays for EGFR mutation detection have potential in clinical blood testing.
