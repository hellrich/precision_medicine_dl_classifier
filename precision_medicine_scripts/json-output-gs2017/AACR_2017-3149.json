Approximately 30% of cervical cancer patients have the PIK3CA-E545K mutation. Cisplatin with radiotherapy (RT) is the standard treatment of cervical cancer world-wide, used in both the radical and post-operative adjuvant settings. However, details of the molecular mechanisms responsible for cisplatin resistance remain unclear. We previously reported PIK3CA mutation in patients with earlier stage (IB/II) cervical cancer was associated with poor survival (McIntyre et al. Gynecol Oncol. 2013, PMID:23266353), and in our recent study we observed that PIK3CA-E545K mutation renders cervical cancer cells more resistant to cisplatin or cisplatin plus RT and results in a more migratory phenotype than isogenic cell lines with wild type-PIK3CA. Moreover, these phenotypes are reversed by the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941/Pictilisib (Wani et al. Oncotarget. 2016, PMID:27489350). The aim of the present study is to identify the expression of genes related to cisplatin resistance in cervical cancer cells engineered to express PIK3CA-E545K. Microarray analysis identified 161 genes that were up-regulated and 189 that were down-regulated in the cervical cancer cells stably expressing PIK3CA-E545K, some of which are involved in well-characterized mechanisms that could be relevant to cisplatin resistance. We are currently validating some of those genes by Real-time PCR that will help us to determine the mechanism of PIK3CA-E545K induced cisplatin resistance and enhanced migration in cervical cancer cells expressing PIK3CA-E545K and extending our in vitro findings to animal models. Together, our data will provide a useful basis for screening candidate targets for risk stratification and provide valuable information for potential targeted intervention in patients whose tumors harbor cisplatin-resistant molecular characteristics.","title":"Identification of genes associated with the cisplatin resistance in cervical cancer cells expressing E545K mutation.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-3149"}
