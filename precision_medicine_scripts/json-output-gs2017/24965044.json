Recently, a number of tumor-specific chromosome translocations and associated fusion genes have been identified in adipocytic tumors and atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas (ALT/WDL), which have a supernumerary ring and/or giant chromosome marker with amplified sequences of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) could be used to amplify MDM2 and CDK4 from total RNA samples obtained from core-needle biopsy sections for the diagnosis of ALT/WDL.\nA series of lipoma (n \u003d 124) and ALT/WDL (n \u003d 44) cases were analyzed for cytogenetic analysis and lipoma fusion genes, as well as for MDM2 and CDK4 expression by real-time PCR. Moreover, the expression of MDM2 and CDK4 in whole tissue sections was compared with that in core-needle biopsy sections of the same tumor in order to determine whether real-time PCR could be used to distinguish ALT/WDL from lipoma at the preoperative stage.\nIn whole tissue sections, the medians for MDM2 and CDK4 expression in ALT/WDL were higher than those in the lipomas (P \u003c 0.05). Moreover, karyotype subdivisions with rings and/or giant chromosomes had higher MDM2 and CDK4 expression levels compared to karyotypes with 12q13-15 rearrangements, other abnormal karyotypes, and normal karyotypes (P \u003c 0.05). On the other hand, MDM2 and CDK4 expression levels in core-needle biopsy sections were similar to those in whole-tissue sections (MDM2: P \u003d 0.6, CDK4: P \u003d 0.8, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).\nQuantitative real-time PCR of total RNA can be used to evaluate the MDM2 and CDK4 expression levels in core-needle biopsies and may be useful for distinguishing ALT/WDL from adipocytic tumors. Thus, total RNA from core-needle biopsy sections may have potential as a routine diagnostic tool for other tumors where gene overexpression is a feature of the tumor.","title":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of MDM2 and CDK4 expression using total RNA from core-needle biopsies is useful for diagnosing adipocytic tumors.","pubmedId":"24965044"}
