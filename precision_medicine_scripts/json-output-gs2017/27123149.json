However, with the development of EGFR mutation detection assays, patients with complex EGFR mutations are emerging, and their response to EGFR-TKIs remains unclear. The present study reports a case of a 62-year-old, non-smoking female patient with advanced NSCLC, presenting with concurrent EGFR 19+21 sensitizing mutations, who had a poor response to the first-line EGFR-TKI erlotinib and succumbed 5 months subsequent to diagnosis. Furthermore, the present study performed a literature review, and 18 patients with complex EGFR 19+21 mutations that had received EGFR-TKIs were identified. The majority of these patients responded well to EGFR-TKIs. To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the first to report a patient with lung adenocarcinoma with complex EGFR 19+21 sensitizing mutations that had a poor clinical response to a first-line EGFR-TKI. Despite the 70% response rate of sensitizing EGFR-mutant NSCLCs to EGFR-TKIs, there is still a proportion of patients that experience de novo resistance, and heterogeneity is likely to be important in this resistance mechanism. Therefore, comprehensive genomic detection assays and multi-targeted therapies for patients with NSCLC with complex EGFR mutations require additional investigation.","title":"EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and concurrent exon 19 and 21 EGFR mutations: A case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"27123149"}
