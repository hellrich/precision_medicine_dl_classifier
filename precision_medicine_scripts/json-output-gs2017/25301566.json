The planned patient number was 40, and the primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by independent reviewers.\nOne patient refused the treatment after enrollment; thus, 39 patients were treated and analyzed. The 3-drug therapy was delivered for a median of 4 cycles, and 54 % of the patients proceeded to the maintenance therapy for a median of 4 cycles. The overall response rate was 74.4 % (29/39), with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 60.0 to 88.7 %. The median PFS and overall survival (OS) were 6.2 months (95 % CI, 4.8-8.5 months) and 22.4 months (95 % CI, 11.3-26.2 months), respectively. Toxicities of grade 3 or higher included neutropenia in 71.8 %, febrile neutropenia in 23.1 %, and hypertension in 38.5 % of the patients, but they were transient and manageable.\nThe primary endpoint was met. The regimen yielded promising results with an excellent overall response rate, PFS, and OS for chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Further studies are warranted.","title":"Phase II study of carboplatin, docetaxel and bevacizumab for chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25301566"}
