Little is known about this population.\nWe screened consecutive adolescents (ages 14-21) in 13 primary care sites for presence of depression symptoms for \"at least a few days\" or \"nearly every day\" in the last two weeks for possible enrollment in a primary care/Internet-based depression prevention intervention (CATCH-IT). We report illness severity, prevalence of self-harm ideation, prevalence correlates (automatic negative thoughts, generalized self-efficacy, perceived social support from family and friends) and co-occurring symptoms of other mental disorders with depressed mood.\nTwenty-one percent (N\u003d293) of those screened reported a core symptom of depressive disorder of which 83 enrolled in the study and were analyzed. The sample was 40% ethnic minority with a mean zip code household income of $40,249 (SD\u003d$14,500). Reporting at least one symptom of another mental disorder was common for anxiety (48%, N\u003d40), substance abuse (31%, N\u003d15), conduct disorder (71%, N\u003d53), as were self-harm ideation (16%, N\u003d12) and reporting school impairment (100%, N\u003d83). Prevalence correlates for current depressive symptoms included low self-efficacy, automatic negative thoughts, perceived low peer acceptance, and school impairment.\nAdolescents with sub-threshold depressed mood have frequent co-morbid symptoms that may need to be considered in developing prevention interventions. Early intervention targets to reduce depressed mood include pessimistic thinking, low self-efficacy, low peer acceptance, and school impairment.","title":"Adolescents in Primary Care with Sub-Threshold Depressed Mood Screened for Participation in a Depression Prevention Study: Co-Morbidity and Factors Associated with Depressive Symptoms.","pubmedId":"23795221"}
