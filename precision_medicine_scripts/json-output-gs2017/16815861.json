However, synovial density of gluco-corticoid receptor positive (GR+), androgen receptor positive (AR+), ERalpha+ and ERbeta+ cells were not different among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. In patients with osteoarthritis, the density of GR+ cells positively correlated with the density of AR+, ERalpha+ and ERbeta+ cells (p \u003d 0.007), which was not observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This indicates positively coupled steroid hormone receptor expression in patients with osteoarthritis but not in those with rheumatoid arthritis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, secretion of synovial IL6 and IL8 positively correlated with the density of ERalpha+ and ERbeta+ cells (not with gluco-corticoid receptor and androgen receptor), which was not found in the synovium of patients with osteoarthritis. This indicates that inflammatory factors might up regulate the expression of oestrogen receptors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, or vice versa.\nIn patients with osteoarthritis, expression of different steroid receptors is positively coupled, which was not observed in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This uncoupling phenomenon in rheumatoid arthritis might lead to an imbalance of the normal synovial homeostasis.","title":"Quantitative determination of steroid hormone receptor positive cells in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis: is there a link to inflammation?","pubmedId":"16815861"}
