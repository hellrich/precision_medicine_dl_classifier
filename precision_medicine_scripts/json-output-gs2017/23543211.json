In a nationwide cohort, we examined the results of primary treatment, progression-free survival (PFS), treatment-free interval (TFI), and OS of BRCA1 versus BRCA2 EOC patients.\nTwo hundred and forty-five BRCA1- and 99 BRCA2-associated EOC patients were identified through all Dutch university hospitals. Analyses were carried out with the Pearson\u0027s Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression methods.\nBRCA1 patients were younger at EOC diagnosis than BRCA2 patients (51 versus 55 years; P \u003c 0.001), without differences regarding histology, tumor grade, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage. Complete response rates after primary treatment, including chemotherapy, did not differ between BRCA1 (86%) and BRCA2 patients (90%). BRCA1 versus BRCA2 patients had a shorter PFS (median 2.2 versus 3.9 years, respectively; P \u003d 0.006), TFI (median 1.7 versus 2.8 years; P \u003d 0.009), and OS (median 6.0 versus 9.7 years; P \u003d 0.04). Differences could not be explained by age at diagnosis, FIGO stage or type of treatment.\nPFS and OS were substantially longer in BRCA2- than in BRCA1-associated EOC patients. While response rates after primary treatment were similarly high in both groups, TFI, as surrogate for chemosensitivity, was significantly longer in BRCA2 patients.","title":"Outcome of BRCA1- compared with BRCA2-associated ovarian cancer: a nationwide study in the Netherlands.","pubmedId":"23543211"}
