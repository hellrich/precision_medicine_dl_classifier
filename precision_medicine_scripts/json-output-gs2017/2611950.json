Ultraviolet (UV) and mitomycin-C (MMC) were used as agents to induce injury of DNA. Experimental results showed that the level of UDS in the aged person was lower than that of the young person. Comparing the level of UDS of the aged before and after medication, it was shown that the level of UDS after medication was increased, approaching that of the young. Within a range of lower doses (less than 5mg/kg weight), the SCE value of mice marrow cells raised with the increase of MMC concentration, while this values was markedly lowered in the medicated mice as compared with that of the control. It is thus suggested that ERD could enhance the DNA repair capacity and this might be a part of the mechanism of \"Invigorating Kidney and retarding aging\" as indicated in TCM.","title":"[Effect of an essence-restoring decoction on DNA repair capacity].","pubmedId":"2611950"}
