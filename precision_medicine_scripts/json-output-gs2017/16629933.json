They are broadly classified into intrahepatic tumours, (extrahepatic) hilar tumours and (extrahepatic) distal bile duct tumours. In spite of well-understood predispositions, most cholangiocarcinomas arise in the absence of risk factors. In suspected cases, the diagnosis can be established with non-invasive imaging studies. Biliary invasion should be reserved for patients with obstruction. In high-risk patients, advanced cytological tests of aneuploidy (digital image analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization) aid early diagnosis. In the absence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, curative surgical resection has 5-year survival rates of 2-43%, higher survival observed in patients with clear surgical margins and concomitant hepatic resection for hilar tumours. Patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma or pre-existing primary sclerosing cholangitis should be considered for liver transplantation with neoadjuvant chemoirradiation, in specialized centres.","title":"Review article: the modern diagnosis and therapy of cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"16629933"}
