It also appears to accelerate cancer progression in genetically engineered mouse models. We now report that in a mouse model where oncogenic Kras is activated in all pancreatic cell types, two brief episodes of acute pancreatitis caused rapid PanIN progression and accelerated pancreatic cancer development. Thus, a brief inflammatory insult to the pancreas, when occurring in the context of oncogenic Kras(G12D), can initiate a cascade of events that dramatically enhances the risk for pancreatic malignant transformation.","title":"Acute pancreatitis markedly accelerates pancreatic cancer progression in mice expressing oncogenic Kras.","pubmedId":"19292977"}
