All cases were with very atypical process. From these patients 3 interesting cases are described in more details. A 75-years-old woman with gastroscopically verified endoluminal tumour in the proximal third of stomach, 6x7 cm, 76-years-old man with a large endoluminal tumour in D2-D3 part of the duodenum, 4x4 cm, and 62-years-old man with verified extraluminal tumour by CT examination in the middle part of stomach. In all cases, gastrointestinal stromal tumour was histologically confirmed. Work is well photo-documented pre-surgically with endoscopic and CT-findings and during surgery: individual steps during the removal of these tumours. In assessment of the size and number of mitoses, tumours belonged to a group with highly malignant potential. Patients are regularly checked in 3-months intervals and also examination by positron emission tomography was performed--it seems to have the best demonstrability of possible relapse. All three patients live and are subjectively and objectively without significant problems (Tab. 5, Fig. 5, Ref. 7).
