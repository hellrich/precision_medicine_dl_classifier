Among any tumors studied previously, these showed the highest percentage of mutations that (a) were G --\u003e T transversions at either KRAS (86%) or TP53 (76%), (b) clustered at the G-rich codons 153-158 of TP53 (33%), and (c) had 100% of the guanines of the G --\u003e T transversions on the nontranscribed strand. This mutation spectrum is consistent with an exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are the primary component of the smoky coal emissions. These results show that mutations in the TP53 and KRAS genes can reflect a specific environmental exposure.","title":"Lung tumor KRAS and TP53 mutations in nonsmokers reflect exposure to PAH-rich coal combustion emissions.","pubmedId":"11559534"}
