Two of 20 frozen endometrial carcinoma specimens were also shown to contain a point mutation in Ki-ras codon 12. No correlation between ras mutation and a number of histologic or clinical parameters was observed.\nThese data suggest a potential role for Ki-ras codon 12 mutations in the development of some (10%) endometrial cancers.","title":"Mutations of the Ki-ras oncogene in endometrial carcinoma.","pubmedId":"1442931"}
