This study compared the abilities of all published proposed clinical staging systems to predict time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) failure after radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate carcinoma.\nA total of 1441 clinically localized prostate carcinoma patients who were managed with radical prostatectomy at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia (n \u003d 688) or the Brigham and Women\u0027s Hospital in Boston (n \u003d 288) or with external beam radiation therapy at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy in Boston (n \u003d 465) were entered into this study. Patients who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormonal or radiation therapy were excluded. Akaike\u0027s Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwartz Bayesian Criterion (SBC) estimates, which are comparative measures, were calculated for each clinical staging system. Pairwise comparisons of the AIC and SBC estimates for the most predictive clinical staging systems were performed using a formal bootstrap technique with 2000 replications.\nBoth the staging system based on the risk score and the staging system based on the calculated volume of prostate carcinoma and PSA (cVCa-PSA) optimized the prediction of time to posttreatment PSA failure. The cVCa-PSA system, however, provided a more clinically useful stratification of outcome.\nImproved clinical staging for patients with localized prostate carcinoma may be possible with parameters obtained during routine evaluation. Validation by other investigators is underway.","title":"Assessment of outcome prediction models for patients with localized prostate carcinoma managed with radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy.","pubmedId":"9587121"}
