The risk factors of depression were analyzed by using univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis.\nOf these 228 ASO patients, 133 (58.3%) were found to be depressive. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that female (OR\u003d0.15,95% CI:0.05-0.45), hypertension (OR\u003d4.63,95% CI:1.90-11.29), coronary heart disease (OR\u003d3.62,95%CI:1.43-9.18), as well as Fontaine 2a (OR\u003d20.76,95% CI:3.21-134.28), 2b (OR\u003d26.34,95% CI:4.20-164.97), 3(OR\u003d192.28,95% CI:25.97-1423.51), and 4(OR\u003d291.41,95% CI:28.67-2962.21) were the risk factors of depression in ASO patients.\nASO patients can easily develop depression. Female, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and Fontaine 2a, 2b,3,and 4 are the risk factors of depression in ASO patients.","title":"[Logistic Regression Analysis of Depression in Arteriosclerosis Obliterans Patients and Its Risk Factors].","pubmedId":"26564507"}
