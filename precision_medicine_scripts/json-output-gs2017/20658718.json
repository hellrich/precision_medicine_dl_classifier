All of the patients were divided into 4 groups depending on the positive or negative status of ER and PR, and 2 subgroups, those with positive or negative HER2 status. Standard descriptive statistical parameters were calculated and several types of tests were applied: Student\u0027s t-test for paired and unpaired samples, chi-square test, Mantel- Haenszel test, Fisher\u0027s test of exact probability and binary logistic regression model.\nThe level of ER and PR status positively correlated with patient age, postmenopausal status, lower clinical stage, lower histologic grade (HG) and nuclear grade (NG) and better prognosis. Amplification/overexpression of HER2 positively correlated with premenopausal status and ER negative breast cancer phenotype. According to the model of binary logistic regression, clinical stage and NG of the breast primary were significantly associated with hormonal sensitivity of the tumor.\nMeasurements of receptor macromolecules in clinical oncology is very important, especially in breast cancer patients. ER and PR analysis is an integral part of breast cancer study since it can provide information essential for both treatment and prognosis.","title":"Hormone sensitivity of primary breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20658718"}
