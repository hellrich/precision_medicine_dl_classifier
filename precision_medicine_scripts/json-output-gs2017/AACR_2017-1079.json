In an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT01976741) BAY 1163877 showed clinical responses at exceptional tolerability in patients suffering from different tumor types including urothelial bladder carcinoma or lung tumors, which were selected based on elevated FGFR1-3 mRNA expression. In the preclinical phase, the compound demonstrated significant single agent anti-tumor activity in various tumor models with different FGFR alterations leading to FGFR overexpression (e.g. FGFR gene amplifications or mutations). Genetic alterations of FGFRs can also be found in breast cancer with 7.5 - 17% of all tumors harboring a FGFR1 gene amplification. Elevated FGFR1 mRNA levels can be found in up to 22% of breast cancer cell lines as well as clinical samples. Other FGFR alterations include FGFR2 or FGFR4 gene amplifications as well as elevated FGFR mRNA levels, which were reported in all breast cancer subtypes. We therefore investigated BAY1163877 monotherapy in various breast cancer models. Due to the favorable clinical safety profile of BAY1163877, we also examined a combination treatment with early line antihormonal therapies in hormone receptor positive breast cancer.In vitro profiling of BAY 1163877 in a number of breast cancer cell lines showed a clear association of efficacy with expression levels of different FGFR isoforms. The efficacy was further investigated in several patient- or cell line-derived breast cancer in vivo models. For instance, BAY 1163877 alone dosed 38mg/kg twice daily induced tumor growth inhibition of greater than 90% in a subcutaneous mouse syngeneic 4T1 breast cancer model expressing elevated levels of FGFR2.Resistance to endocrine therapy appears associated with FGFR1 gene amplification and may explain the poor prognosis of FGFR1 overexpressing tumors treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. We therefore investigated the combination of the panFGFR-inhibitor BAY 1163877 with the clinically used antihormonal compound fulvestrant in selected luminal breast cancer PDX models. Some of these models showed resistance to antihormonal treatment in monotherapy but improved in vivo efficacy in combined treatment using BAY 1163877 and fulvestrant.These data may warrant further clinical investigation of BAY1163877alone or in combination with antihormonal therapy in patients with FGFR overexpressing breast cancer.","title":"Preclinical activity of the FGFRinhibitor BAY 1163877 alone or in combination with antihormonal therapy in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-1079"}
