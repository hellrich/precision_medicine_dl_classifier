However, no optimal concurrent chemotherapeutic regimen has been described. This study aimed to assess concurrent pemetrexed, nedaplatin and thoracic intensity-modulated radiotherapy followed by consolidation pemetrexed/nedaplatin for unresectable Stage IIIA/B lung adenocarcinoma.\nPatients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma received thoracic intensity-modulated radiotherapy at 60-64 Gy in 30-32 fractions, concurrently with two cycles of 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed, with nedaplatin doses escalating from 60 mg/m2 (level 1) to 70 mg/m2 (level 2) and 80 mg/m2 (level 3). Consolidation consisted of three pemetrexed/nedaplatin (500 mg/m2, 60 mg/m2) cycles every 3 weeks after concurrent therapy. The primary objective of the safety was to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). The secondary endpoints included response rate, PFS and OS.\nFifteen patients were enrolled, including 3, 6 and 6 individuals in the first, second, and third dose levels, respectively. Three cases of dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 hepatitis, pneumonitis, and grade 4 thrombocytopenia), including one and two patients at levels 2 and 3, respectively, were observed and resulted in discontinued/delayed treatment. Response rates were 86.7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 64.2-97.8 %) and 64.3 % (95 % CI, 38.3-85.4 %) at chemoradiation and treatment completions, respectively. Median OS was 30.0 months (95 % CI, 16.4-43.6 months); 2-year OS was 44.0 % (95 % CI, 18.7-69.2 %). Median PFS was 12.0 months (95 % CI, 6.9-17.0 months), and the 2-year PFS 27.0 % (95 % CI, 4.7-49.3 %).\nFull dose 500 mg/m2 of pemetrexed and nedaplatin 70 mg/m2 could be used safely with thoracic intensity-modulated radiotherapy for inoperable stage III lung adenocarcinoma. Further evaluation of stage III lung adenocarcinoma management is warranted.\nThis study was retrospectively registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( ChiCTR-OPN-16008316 , April 2016).","title":"A phase I study of nedaplatin, pemetrexed and thoracic intensity-modulated radiotherapy for inoperable stage III lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27717315"}
