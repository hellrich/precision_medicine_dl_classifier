The metastasis of malignant meningiomas to distant extracranial sites are well known. However, dissemination of the tumours in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is rare and few cases have been reported. We present a case of histologically proven malignant meningioma with CSF dissemination at the remote intracranial area and into the spinal canal detected with magnetic resonance imaging.","title":"Intracranial malignant meningioma with cerebrospinal fluid dissemination: a case report.","pubmedId":"21740827"}
