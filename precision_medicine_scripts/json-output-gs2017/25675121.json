Treatments for advanced NSCLC are largely palliative and a benefit plateau appears to have reached with the platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib came up with prolonged progression-free survival and improved quality of life, especially in EGFR-mutated patients. Icotinib is an oral selective EGFR tyrosine kinase, which was approved by China Food and Drug administration in June 2011 for treating advanced NSCLC. Its approval was based on the registered Phase III trial (ICOGEN), which showed icotinib is noninferior to gefitinib. This review will discuss the role of icotinib in NSCLC, and its potential application and ongoing investigations.","title":"Icotinib, a selective EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25675121"}
