Although well described in different tumors types, the importance of apoptosis inducer prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) in PC has not been appreciated. PC is an oncogenic kras driven disease, which is known to downregulate Par-4. Therefore, this review highlights its significance and builds a strong case supporting the role of Par-4 as a possible therapeutic target in PC.\nLiterature-based evidence spanning the last 15 years on Par-4 and its significance in PC.\nThis review provides comprehensive knowledge of the significance of Par-4 and its association with kras status in PC, along with the crosstalk with crucial resistance and survival molecules NF-kappaB and Bcl-2 that ultimately are responsible for the overall poor outcome of different therapeutic approaches in this disease.\nPar-4 holds promise as a potential therapeutic target that can be induced by chemopreventive agents and small-molecule inhibitors either alone or in combination with standard chemotherapeutics leading to selective apoptosis in PC cells. It also acts as a chemosensitizer and therefore warrants further clinical investigations in this disease.","title":"PAR-4 as a possible new target for pancreatic cancer therapy.","pubmedId":"20426700"}
