The results were statistically analyzed to examine the correlation between the classification and overall survival (OS) using Cox regression analyses, and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analyses.\nThe 5-year OS rates for adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) were 98%. Five-year OS rates of Lepidic-, acinar-, papillary-, micropapillary-, and solid-predominant adenocarcinomas was 93%, 67%, 74%, 62%, and 58%, respectively. The IDI estimates revealed that classification of ADC into the 7 subgroups had a higher estimated (0.0175) than did the combined histological grouping (AIS + MIA, lepidic + acinar + papillary, micropapillary + solid + others) (0.0111). Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations, KRAS gene mutations, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene alterations were statistically prevalent in papillary-predominant (P \u003d 0.00001), invasive mucinous (P \u003d 0.00001), and micropapillary- and acinar-predominant (P \u003d 0.00001) adenocarcinomas, respectively.\nThe new classification reflects disease prognosis, and was also associated with driver gene alterations.","title":"The utility of the proposed IASLC/ATS/ERS lung adenocarcinoma subtypes for disease prognosis and correlation of driver gene alterations.","pubmedId":"23891509"}
