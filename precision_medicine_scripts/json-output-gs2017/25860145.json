Serum POTEE levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Numerical variables were recorded as means ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed by independent t tests. Categorical variables were calculated as rates and were analyzed using a χ2 test or Fisher\u0027s exact test. Survival curves were estimated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests.\nSerum POTEE levels were significantly higher in NSCLC patients than in benign lung disease patients and healthy controls (mean ± SD [pg/ml], 324.38± 13.84 vs. 156.93 ± 17.38 and 139.09 ± 15.80, P\u003c0.001) and were significantly correlated with TNM stage. Survival analysis revealed that patients with low serum POTEE had longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those with high serum POTEE (P\u003d0.021). Cox multivariate analysis indicated that POTEE was an independent prognostic factor of progression-free survival (P \u003d0.009, hazard ratio, 2.440).\nSerum POTEE level in NSCLC patients is associated with TNM stage and is a potential prognostic factor.","title":"Serum levels of the cancer-testis antigen POTEE and its clinical significance in non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25860145"}
