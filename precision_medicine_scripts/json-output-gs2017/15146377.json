Although most liposarcomas of the spermatic cord are well-differentiated, the propensity for local recurrence is high. Preferential treatment of spermatic cord liposarcoma is radical orchiectomy with high ligation of the cord. Radiation therapy is recommended in addition to surgery in cases with evidence of more aggressive tumour behavior (i.e., high-grade tumour, lymphatic invasion, inadequate margin, or recurrence). A 39-year-old-male presented with a 4-year history of a mass in the left scrotum. Radical orchiectomy was performed. Pathological analysis demonstrated a well-differentiated liposarcoma with tumour detection in the surgical margin. In view of the incomplete surgical removal of the tumour a retroperitoneal reoperation of the testicular vessels and vas deferent with R0-resection was conducted. Without any postoperative adjuvant therapy in evidence of recurrence or metastasis was noted during the 12-month follow-up period. The current literature on management of malignant tumours of the spermatic cord is reviewed. Paratesticular liposarcomas are most commonly well-differentiated and lipoma-like and have a prolonged clinical course. Radical orchiectomy with wide local excision of the mass is the recommended therapy, while adjuvant radiotherapy may be considered in high-grade tumours and in recurrent liposarcomas. Retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy does not offer any additional therapeutic benefit, and the role of chemotherapy is not well defined. Regardless of initial therapy, the risk of local recurrence always necessitates long-term followup.","title":"[Liposarcoma of the spermatic cord--report of one new case and review of the literature].","pubmedId":"15146377"}
