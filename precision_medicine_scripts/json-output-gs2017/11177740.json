Greater public awareness and acceptance of screening programs have contributed significantly to increasingly earlier detection of colon cancer and decreased mortality. Advances made in the understanding of this disease, both in terms of its clinical behavior and molecular pathogenesis, have translated into major improvements in its therapy. Several large randomized trials during the last two decades have helped the oncology community forge a successful multi-modality treatment strategy against colon cancer. These studies have defined the role of adjuvant therapy for colon cancer after curative surgery. Despite all the advances, a large number of patients continue to succumb to this disease, and the search for better therapies is still necessary. In this article, we discuss the evolution and the current state of adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer and briefly review new developments.","title":"Adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer.","pubmedId":"11177740"}
