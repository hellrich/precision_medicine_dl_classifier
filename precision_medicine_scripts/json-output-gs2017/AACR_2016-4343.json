Liquid biopsy studies to-date have been limited to modest-sized cohorts and case studies. Here we present genomic profiling results from liquid biopsies of \u003e10,000 advanced cancer patients in whom Guardant360TM (G360) was ordered for clinical care.G360 provides deep-coverage (15,000x average) and highly accurate sequencing of ctDNA across a 70-gene target-capture panel. It detects single nucleotide variants, indels, gene amplifications, and fusions across all NCCN-recommended solid tumor genomic alterations with analytic specificity \u003e99.9999% and analytic sensitivity \u003c0.1% mutant allele frequency. Consecutive commercial test results (6/2014-11/2015) were analyzed for yield and patterns of genomic alterations by tumor type. ctDNA mutation patterns and frequencies were compared to published tumor tissue sequencing results (TCGA, ICGC).Of the \u003e10,000 patients (\u003e50 solid cancer types), 80% of patients had at least one somatic alteration detected in ctDNA (median \u003d 3; mean \u003d 4.3 alterations). The most common cancers were lung (32%), gastrointestinal (23%), and breast (14%). Mutational spectra across the 70 analyzed genes were similar to TCGA results with the notable exception of increased prevalence of resistance mutations in the liquid biopsy cohort, likely owing to ongoing/prior therapy. Canonical drivers in NSCLC patients were generally mutually exclusive, although activating EGFR or RAS mutations were observed in 12.5% of patients with fusions (5/40). Colorectal cancers showed both mutual exclusivity among KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF drivers, and convergent evolution toward downstream pathway activation under anti-EGFR therapy, with some samples showing multiple resistance mechanisms. Mutation patterns for the most frequently mutated genes were generally well correlated between ctDNA and published tissue data, including for commonly altered tumor suppressor genes (for TP53: Pearson r \u003d 0.94, Spearman  \u003d 0.80).G360 is ordered prior to initial treatment when biopsy tissue is exhausted, unobtainable or under-genotyped, but more often is ordered upon progression to identify evolving resistance mechanisms that may be targetable. Thus, relative frequencies of genomic alterations were expected to differ from published frequencies established in unselected, early-stage, treatment-nave cohorts. Nonetheless, the specific patterns of alterations in ctDNA from this unprecedented liquid biopsy cohort largely recapitulated patterns observed in published tissue sequencing studies. Moreover, ctDNA sequencing clearly and robustly identified convergent evolution of drug resistance occurring under therapy.","title":"Comparison of over 10,000 clinical NGS circulating tumor DNA profiles to tissue-derived genomic compendia","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4343"}
