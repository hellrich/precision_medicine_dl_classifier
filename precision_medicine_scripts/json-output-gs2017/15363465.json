Surgery and radiotherapy are the treatment modalities of choice for early and locally advanced cervical cancer. However, the role of chemotherapy in this setting has been better investigated in the latest years. To improve loco-regional control in locally advanced disease, authors have tested both neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy. From 1999 NCI clinical announcement, concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation is considered the treatment of choice for cervical cancer patients requiring radiation therapy. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is reaching encouraging results in IB bulky-IIA cervical cancer, but further investigation are ongoing in locally advanced cervical setting. The optimal treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer is still undefined and chemotherapy is used with palliation intent. Cisplatin remains the most active cytotoxic agents, although combinations of cisplatin with paclitaxel, topotecan, vinorelbine, have shown encouraging results in phase II and in early phase III studies. This paper reviews the role of chemotherapy in the management of patients with locally advanced, metastatic and recurrent cervical cancer. Studies discussed in this paper were selected trough a search in the med-line database performed in October 2003.","title":"The role of chemotherapy in locally advanced, metastatic and recurrent cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"15363465"}
