Extended or radical resections, to include the entire stomach, regional lymph nodes,or contiguous organs, have thus been proposed to alter the course of this fatal disease; however, no prospective randomized trial has validated this approach in a Western center. Furthermore, there are other malignant tumors that occur in the stomach and that may be successfully treated with a limited, nonanatomic, or subtotal gastrectomy, or in the case of gastric lymphoma, without surgery at all. Palliative approaches to patients who have advanced gastric cancer, which should be conservative by nature, are also outlined.","title":"Limited gastric resection.","pubmedId":"16139033"}
