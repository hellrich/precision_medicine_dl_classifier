If EGFR mutations can be observed in serum DNA, this could serve as a noninvasive source of information on the genotype of the original tumor cells that could influence treatment and the ability to predict patient response to gefitinib. Serum genomic DNA was obtained from Japanese patients with NSCLC before first-line gefitinib monotherapy. Scorpion Amplified Refractory Mutation System technology was used to detect EGFR mutations. Wild-type EGFR was detected in all of the 27 serum samples. EGFR mutations were detected in 13 of 27 (48.1%) patients and two major EGFR mutations were identified (E746_A750del and L858R). The EGFR mutations were seen significantly more frequently in patients with a partial response than in patients with stable disease or progressive disease (P \u003d 0.046, Fisher\u0027s exact test). The median progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients with EGFR mutations than in patients without EGFR mutations (200 versus 46 days; P \u003d 0.005, log-rank test). The median survival was 611 days in patients with EGFR mutations and 232 days in patients without EGFR mutations (P \u003e 0.05). In pairs of tumor and serum samples obtained from 11 patients, the EGFR mutation status in the tumors was consistent with those in the serum of 8 of 11 (72.7%) of the paired samples. Thus, EGFR mutations were detectable using Scorpion Amplified Refractory Mutation System technology in serum DNA from patients with NSCLC. These results suggest that patients with EGFR mutations seem to have better outcomes with gefitinib treatment, in terms of progression-free survival, overall survival, and response, than those patients without EGFR mutations.","title":"Detection of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in serum as a predictor of the response to gefitinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"16818687"}
