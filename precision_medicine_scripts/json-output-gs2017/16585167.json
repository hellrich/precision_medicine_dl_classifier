Met amplification was localized to unstable double minute chromosomes and was uniquely found in mouse breast tumors driven by loss of Brca1 and Trp53. Whereas analogous MET amplification was not found in human breast cancers, the identification of a dominant somatic genetic lesion in the Brca1/Trp53 mouse model suggests that recurrent secondary hits may also exist in BRCA1-initiated human breast cancer.","title":"Frequent met oncogene amplification in a Brca1/Trp53 mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis.","pubmedId":"16585167"}
