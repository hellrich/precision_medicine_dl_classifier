Therefore, there are few data on the natural history, presentation, treatment, and prognosis of this neoplasm.\nThis study is a report of data from 76 patients with head and neck liposarcoma of whom 4 were treated at The Royal Marsden Hospital during the past 50 years.\nThe median age of patient presentation was the seventh decade (range, 6 months-86 years), and 65% of the patients were male. The commonest site of presentation was the neck (28%), followed by the larynx (20%) and pharynx (18%). Sixty-two percent of tumors were low grade (well differentiated and myxoid), and 38% were high grade (pleomorphic and round cell). The principal determinant of outcome was histologic grade. Five-year survival by life-table analysis was 67% overall and varied with tumor type as follows: well differentiated 100%, myxoid 73%, pleomorphic 42%, and round cell 0%. Site appears to have had some influence on prognosis. Oral liposarcoma had a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival of 50%, despite the low grade of all tumors; however, the 5-year survival for laryngeal (89%) and head (83%) liposarcoma was considerably better. Tumor size did not affect prognosis. The mainstay of treatment was surgical excision, used alone in 70% of the cases. Radiotherapy was used with other treatments in 25% of the cases. Prognosis was best for patients treated with surgery only (5-year survival, 83%), compared with those receiving surgery plus radiotherapy (5-year survival, 63%), chemotherapy (5-year survival, 33%), and radiotherapy alone (5-year survival, 0%).\nLiposarcoma rarely involves the head and neck region. The prognosis for patients with this disease appears to be better than for those with liposarcoma arising elsewhere, particularly in the retroperitoneum. Prognosis is principally dependent on histologic grade. Complete surgical excision provides the most effective treatment.","title":"Head and neck liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"8625207"}
