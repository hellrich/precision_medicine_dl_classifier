To determine the mechanism of brain expansion, we studied the relationship between invasive meningioma and cell adhesion molecules. Immunostaining for E-cadherin (E-CH), N-cadherin (N-CH), beta-catenin, and Ki-67 was performed in 103 meningiomas that consisted of 61 meningothelial meningiomas, 25 fibrous meningiomas, 12 invasive meningiomas and 5 anaplastic meningiomas. All tumors were negative for N-CH. All the 61 meningothelial meningiomas, 10 of 12 invasive meningiomas, and 3 of 5 anaplastic meningiomas were positive for both E-CH and beta-catenin, while these were both negative in all of the fibrous meningiomas. In invasive meningiomas, the expansive part of the tumor showed a lower rate (4/12 tumors) of E-CH and beta-catenin positivity, while the central part showed a higher rate (10/12 tumors). The Ki-67 labeling index was higher in invasive and anaplastic meningiomas than in meningothelial meningiomas. These results suggest that a reduction in cell adhesion molecules and increased proliferative activity may be related, which may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of meningioma expansion in the future.","title":"Invasive meningioma is associated with a low expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin.","pubmedId":"15696778"}
