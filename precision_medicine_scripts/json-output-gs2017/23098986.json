Endoscopy showed the patient had a mass in the cervical esophagus. Multiple biopsy specimens were taken, which were inconclusive for a diagnosis. A positron-emission tomography scan showed a hypermetabolic lesion. A transoral endoscopic approach was used to resect the tumor. Final histologic examination revealed a completely resected low-grade liposarcoma.","title":"Transoral endoscopic resection of esophageal liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"23098986"}
