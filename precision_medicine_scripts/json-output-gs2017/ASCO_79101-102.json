Although its diagnosis is of crucial importance, the method has not been standardized. Methods: 345 resected lung cancer specimens and 44 biopsy specimens were used. RNA was extracted from frozen tumors or touch imprint cytologic prepareations and RT-PCR direct sequencing for EML4-ALK fusion or KRAS, EGFR gene mutations was performed. High-sensitivity immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody against ALK (clone 5A4, Santa Cruz) and the Envision Flex+ system (DAKO) in which the linker and the labeled polymer amplifies the signal of the primary antibody. Tissue microarray was created for 345 resected specimens. An ALK break-apart probe (Vysis LSI ALK Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe, Abbott Molecular) was used for Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: In tissue microarray experiments, 12 tumors unequivocally overexpressed ALK protein (3.5%). All these 12 tumors were also positive by FISH. 8 of 12 were confirmed to have rearranged EML4-ALK by sequencing, while 4 were not. We also confirmed that these 4 did not have KIF5B-ALK or TFG-ALK by RT-PCR, indicating that overexpressed ALK with gene rearrangement in these cases might be due to ALK fusion with a novel gene (not yet confirmed). In biopsy specimens, 6 were positive by IHC and all harbored rearranged ALK by FISH. Direct sequencing revealed that all 6 harbored EML4-ALK fusion. Conversely, none of IHC negative tumors were positive for FISH or direct sequencing. In both experiments, strict mutually exclusionary relationship among ALK, EGFR and KRAS was confirmed. Conclusions: IHC using commercially available ALK antibody and high sensitive visualization kit was feasible for archival samples and small biopsy specimens. It was easy and yet reliable, and thus considered as the best suitable method for screening ALK-positive tumors.IHCFISHRT-PCR direct sequence+/-EML4-ALK/EGFR/KRAS/WTTissue microarray (n\u003d345)+1212/08/0/0/4-333Not determined0/132/33/168Biopsy specimens (n\u003d 44)+66/06/0/0/0-380/380/15/1/22","title":"Comparison of high sensitive IHC, FISH, and RT-PCR direct sequencing for detection of ALK translocation in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_79101-102"}
