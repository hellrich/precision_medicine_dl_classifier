This serrated origin accounts for up to 30% of all colorectal tumors but these are heterogeneous regarding molecular characteristics and patient outcome. Here we review the current knowledge about the classification of this tumor subtype and its association with five key features: mutation status of the BRAF or KRAS genes, the CpG island methylation phenotype, microsatellite instability, immune cell infiltration, and overexpression of GTPase RAC1b. Subsequently, available therapeutic approaches for targeting these molecular characteristics are presented and critically discussed.
