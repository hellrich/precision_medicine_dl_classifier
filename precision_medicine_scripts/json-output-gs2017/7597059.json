A recently described technique [Lisitsyn, N., Lisitsyn, N. \u0026 Wigler, M. (1993) Science 259, 946-951] held out the potential to efficiently discover such events in an unbiased manner. Here we present the application of the representational difference analysis (RDA) to the study of cancer. We cloned two DNA fragments that identified a homozygous deletion in a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, mapping to a 1-centimorgan region at chromosome 13q12.3 flanked by the markers D13S171 and D13S260. Interestingly, this lies within the 6-centimorgan region recently identified as the BRCA2 locus of heritable breast cancer susceptibility. This suggests that the same gene may be involved in multiple tumor types and that its function is that of a tumor suppressor rather than that of a dominant oncogene.","title":"Identification by representational difference analysis of a homozygous deletion in pancreatic carcinoma that lies within the BRCA2 region.","pubmedId":"7597059"}
