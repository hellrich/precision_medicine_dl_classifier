There were 9 squamous (45%), 9 chondroid (45%), and 2 spindle cell (10%) MPBCs, all of which were high grade. Ninety-three genomic alterations were identified, (range, 1-11) with 19 of the 20 cases (95%) harboring an alteration that could potentially lead to a targeted treatment option. The most-common alterations were in TP53 (n \u003d 69; 75%), PIK3CA (n \u003d 37; 40%), MYC (n \u003d 28; 30%), MLL2 (n \u003d 28; 30%), PTEN (n \u003d 23; 25%), CDKN2A/B (n \u003d 19; 20%), CCND3 (n \u003d 14; 15%), CCNE1 (n \u003d 9; 10%), EGFR (n \u003d 9; 10%), and KDM6A (n \u003d 9; 10%); AKT3, CCND1, CCND2, CDK4, FBXW7, FGFR1, HRAS, NF1, PIK3R1, and SRC were each altered in a single case. All 16 MPBCs (100%) that were negative for ERBB2 (HER2) overexpression by immunohistochemistry and/or ERBB2 (HER2) amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization were also uniformly (100%) negative for ERBB2 amplification by next-generation sequencing-based copy-number assessment.\nOur results indicate that genomic profiling using next-generation sequencing can identify clinically meaningful alterations that have the potential to guide targeted treatment decisions in most patients with metastatic MPBC.","title":"Genomic profiling of advanced-stage, metaplastic breast carcinoma by next-generation sequencing reveals frequent, targetable genomic abnormalities and potential new treatment options.","pubmedId":"25927147"}
