{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Locally advanced (stages IIIA and IIIB) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 25% of new cases of NSCLC diagnosed annually. The treatment strategy for these patients involves combined-modality therapy with chemotherapy and thoracic radiation. Furthermore, a subset of patients with stage IIIA disease undergo surgical resection. Docetaxel is a chemotherapy agent with activity in both first- and second-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. Several recent studies have also incorporated docetaxel in the treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC as neoadjuvant therapy, alone or in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin and thoracic radiation. Docetaxel has also been used as consolidation therapy. This review will summarize the data to date on the use of docetaxel and thoracic radiation in the treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC.","title":"Concurrent docetaxel and thoracic radiation in non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"14720346"}
