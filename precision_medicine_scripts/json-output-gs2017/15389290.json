Sham-operated animals were used for comparison. On one hand, the maximal velocities (Vmax) for both SR Ca(2+)-uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase activities in skeletal muscle of rats at 8 weeks of MI were higher than those of controls. On the other hand, the Vmax values for both SR Ca(2+)-uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase activities were decreased significantly at 16 weeks of MI when compared with controls. These alterations in Ca(2+)-transport activities were not associated with any change in the affinity (1/Ka) of the SR Ca(2+)-pump for Ca2+. Furthermore, the stimulation of SR Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase activity by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was not altered at 8 or 16 weeks of MI when compared with the respective control values. Treatment of 3-week infarcted animals with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril, imidapril, and enalapril or an angiotensin receptor (AT1R) antagonist, losartan, for a period of 13 weeks not only attenuated changes in left ventricular function but also prevented defects in SR Ca(2+)-pump in skeletal muscle. These results indicate that the skeletal muscle SR Ca(2+)-transport is altered in a biphasic manner in heart failure due to MI. It is suggested that the initial increase in SR Ca(2+)-pump activity in skeletal muscle may be compensatory whereas the depression at late stages of MI may play a role in exercise intolerance and muscle fatigue in congestive heart failure. Furthermore, the improvements in the skeletal muscle SR Ca(2+)-transport by ACE inhibitors may be due to the decreased activity of renin-angiotensin system in congestive heart failure.","title":"Changes in skeletal muscle SR Ca2+ pump in congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction are prevented by angiotensin II blockade.","pubmedId":"15389290"}
