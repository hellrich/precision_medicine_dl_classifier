We decided to investigate the association of PIK3CA mutations with pathologic features and clinical outcome in a large series of patients with breast cancer.\nFrozen samples from 163 consecutive patients were analyzed for PIK3CA mutations using PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analyses.\nWe identified 46 missense mutations, 24 (53%) in exon 9, and 21 (47%) in exon 20. Twelve (50%) of the 24 mutations in exon 9 were of the E542K type and 11 (46%) were of the E545K type. Twenty (95%) of the 21 mutations in exon 20 were H1047R substitutions. Mutations in exon 9 were more frequent in lobular carcinomas (42% of cases) than in ductal carcinoma (11% of cases; P \u003d 0.002). At univariate survival analysis, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with prolonged overall and disease-free survival, whereas mutations in exon 9 were associated with significantly worse prognosis. At multivariate analysis, exon 9 PIK3CA mutations were the strongest independent factor to predict poor prognosis for disease-free survival (P \u003d 0.0003) and overall survival (P \u003d 0.001).\nOur data show that exon 9 PIK3CA mutations are typical of infiltrating lobular carcinomas. In addition, they indicate that PIK3CA mutations in different exons are of different prognostic value: exon 9 mutations are independently associated with early recurrence and death, whereas exon 20 PIK3CA mutations are associated with optimal prognosis.","title":"Different prognostic roles of mutations in the helical and kinase domains of the PIK3CA gene in breast carcinomas.","pubmedId":"17947469"}
