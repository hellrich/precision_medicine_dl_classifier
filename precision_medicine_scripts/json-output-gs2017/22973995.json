The optimal management course remains poorly defined. We present a case of primary basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas metastatic to the liver, which was treated with surgery and systemic chemotherapy. Our patient survived for 15â€‰months: the longest survival reported in the literature to date.\nA 70-year-old Caucasian man presented to hospital with a three-month history of weight loss, pruritus and icterus. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of an operable mass lesion in the head of the pancreas. Following a pancreaticoduodenectomy, histology results led us to make a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Postoperative restaging showed multiple metastases in the liver. He underwent palliative systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil achieving partial response and an excellent quality of life. He then went on to start second-line chemotherapy, but unfortunately died of sepsis soon thereafter.\nThis case report emphasizes that achievement of a worthwhile objective and symptomatic palliative response is possible using platinum-based chemotherapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas.","title":"Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas: a case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"22973995"}
