After radical resection, prognostic difference between them was evaluated through a 1:2 matched case-control study.\nThe pattern of gastric remnant carcinomas showed a male predominance. Undifferentiated type histology, depth at T4 stage and distant metastases were more frequent in gastric remnant carcinomas than in upper-third gastric cancers (P \u003c0.05). The radical resectability of gastric remnant carcinomas was lower and the multi-visceral resectabilitiy was relatively higher than the other group (P \u003d 0.00). Gastric remnant carcinomas trended to have a higher incidence of metastases to either mesojejunum or lower mediastinal lymph nodes than upper-third gastric cancers, but patient survival was not significantly different. In the case-control study, gastric remnant carcinomas had a better prognosis than upper-third gastric cancers after radical resection when the clinicopathologic features and surgical treatment were matched.\nAlthough there was no significant prognostic distinction between gastric remnant carcinomas and upper-third gastric cancer, after radical surgical treatment, patients with the former had an even better prognosis.","title":"Gastric remnant cancer patients had a better prognosis than upper-third gastric cancer patients in a case-control study after surgical treatment.","pubmedId":"24326840"}
