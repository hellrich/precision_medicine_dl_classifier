Mechanisms of macrophage (MΦ) attraction and differentiation to a tumor-promoting phenotype, which is characterized by pronounced interleukin (IL)-10 production, are under investigation. We report that supernatants of dying cancer cells induced substantial IL-10 release from primary human MΦs, dependent on signaling through tyrosine kinase receptor A (TRKA or neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (NTRK1)). Mechanistically, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) release from apoptotic cancer cells triggered src-dependent shuttling of cytosolic TRKA to the plasma membrane via S1P receptor signaling. Plasma membrane-associated TRKA, which was activated by constitutively autocrine secreted nerve growth factor, used phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to induce IL-10. Interestingly, TRKA-dependent signaling was required for cytokine production by TAMs isolated from primary murine breast cancer tissue. Besides IL-10, this pathway initiated secretion of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), indicating relevance in cancer-associated inflammation. Our findings highlight a fine-tuned regulatory system including S1P-dependent TRKA trafficking for executing TAM-like cell function in vitro as well as in vivo.","title":"The role of TRKA signaling in IL-10 production by apoptotic tumor cell-activated macrophages.","pubmedId":"22410777"}
