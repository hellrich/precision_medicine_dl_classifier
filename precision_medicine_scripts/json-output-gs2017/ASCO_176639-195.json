Currently, only 9% of newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer is localized and 5-year survival is 7%. Due to most pancreatic cancers (PC) presenting at a later stage with poor overall survival, early detection methods must be implemented to improve treatment outcomes. Yet, effective early screening guidelines do not exist for pancreatic cancer. Our Early Detection Program (EDP) provides personalized early detection including risk assessment, screening, and genetic testing. We aim to evaluate risk assessment criteria, establish a database to delineate a pattern of characteristics, and utilize a biospecimen repository and molecular based technologies to map novel biomarkers for early detection. Methods: The EDP screens those with a family history or germline mutation consistent with potential increased risk for developing PC. Patients are eligible based on risk assessment and stratified into 3 groups based on the CAPS Consortium criteria (average, moderate, and high risk). Screenings may include genetic testing for germline mutations, blood testing including Hemoglobin A1C (HgBA1C), complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic profile (CMP), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), vitamin D 25-OH, lipid panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Serum and urine collection will be offered for banking for future studies. Patients have yearly screenings including thorough history and physical exam and cases are discussed at a multi-disciplinary pancreatic tumor board. If indicated, patients undergo MRI/MRCP abdomen, GI consult and EUS. Study participants also complete a cancer anxiety index. The EDP is still recruiting patients. Next-generation sequencing and molecular based technologies are being explored for mapping novel biomarkers for early detection. The Institute is expanding to include those at risk for breast and ovarian cancer. We are evaluating risk assessment criteria and are developing a valid and reliable EDP index (EDP-I) anxiety instrument.","title":"Prospective study of early detection of malignancies in individuals at risk for developing pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_176639-195"}
