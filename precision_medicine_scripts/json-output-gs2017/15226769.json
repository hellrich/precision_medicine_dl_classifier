It was not possible to discriminate between lung cancer and benign lung disease owing to the lack of sensitivity-specificity relationship of HER-2 and EGFR ECD levels. Neither HER-2 nor EGFR ECD specific levels were associated with a particular prognosis of NSCLC patients receiving conventional therapy.","title":"Serum EGF-receptor and HER-2 extracellular domains and prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"15226769"}
