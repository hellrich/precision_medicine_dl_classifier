BRAF mutations were less common, 16% in PDAC and 12% in A-AC, and no V600E mutations were found. Fourteen percent with PDAC and 7% with A-AC had mutations in both KRAS and BRAF. Multivariate analysis, including KRAS status, stage, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system score, demonstrated that KRAS mutations in patients with A-AC were associated with short recurrence-free survival (RFS) (hazard ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.06; P \u003d 0.015) and overall survival (OS) (1.93, 95% 1.12-3.31; P \u003d 0.018). KRAS mutations in patients with PDAC were not associated with RFS and OS. BRAF mutations were not associated with RFS and OS.\nKRAS mutations frequencies were high in PDAC and A-AC. KRAS mutations were associated with poor prognosis in patients with A-AC, but not in patients with PDAC.","title":"Frequencies and prognostic role of KRAS and BRAF mutations in patients with localized pancreatic and ampullary adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"22699145"}
