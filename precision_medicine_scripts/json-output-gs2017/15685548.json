Previous in vitro studies showed that mutation of the cysteine residue at position 84 (Cys84Ala) of survivin generates a dominant-negative mutant that triggers mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. We investigated the therapeutic effect of the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated survivin mutant (Cys84Ala) on colon cancer.\nSurvivin mutant (Cys84Ala) (Sur-Mut(Cys84Ala)) was cloned into the AAV expression vector pAM/CAG-WPRE.poly(A) to generate recombinant AAV-Sur-Mut(Cys84Ala) virus. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, and tumor growth were measured in vitro and in vivo.\nTransduction of colon cancer cells with rAAV-Sur-Mut(Cys84Ala) inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe in vitro. rAAV-Sur-Mut(Cys84Ala) sensitized colon cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, expression of survivin mutant mediated by AAV inhibited tumorigenesis in colon cancer cells. Intratumoral injection of rAAV-Sur-Mut(Cys84Ala) significantly induced apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe and inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth in a colon cancer xenograft model in vivo. No obvious cytotoxicity to other tissues was observed. More importantly, rAAV-Sur-Mut(Cys84Ala) expression strongly enhanced the antitumor activity of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), resulting in regression of established tumors.\nOur results showed that rAAV-Sur-Mut(Cys84Ala) induced apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe and inhibited tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. Thus, use of AAV-mediated survivin mutant (Cys84Ala) is a promising strategy in colon cancer gene therapy.","title":"Gene therapy for colon cancer by adeno-associated viral vector-mediated transfer of survivin Cys84Ala mutant.","pubmedId":"15685548"}
