The goal of this study was to test the correlation between FGFR-1 amplification and expression and sensitivity to brivanib, an FGFR-1 small molecule inhibitor, in breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Using CGH array and gene expression profiling, FGFR-1 DNA copy number, mRNA, and protein expression were measured in 21 cell lines and correlated with growth inhibition by brivanib. We examined FGFR-1 autophosphorylation and kinase activity, as well as phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules in response to bFGF and brivanib exposure. CAMA, MDA-MB-361, and HCC38 cells had FGFR-1 amplification and protein overexpression. Brivanib GI(50) values were significantly lower in the gene amplified (15.17 μM, n \u003d 3) compared to normal copy number (69.09 μM, n \u003d 11) or FGFR-1 deleted (76.14 μM, n \u003d 7) cells (P \u003d 0.0107). Among nonamplified cells, there was no correlation between FGFR-1 mRNA or protein expression levels and brivanib sensitivity. Two of three FGFR-1 amplified cells were sensitive to bFGF-induced growth stimulation, which was blocked by brivanib. In cells with amplified FGFR-1, brivanib decreased receptor autophosphorylation, inhibited bFGF-induced tyrosine kinase activity, and reduced phosphorylation of ERK and AKT. Breast cancer cell lines with FGFR-1 gene amplification and protein overexpression are more sensitive to growth inhibition by brivanib than nonamplified cells. These findings suggest that FGFR-1 amplification or protein overexpression in breast cancers may be an indicator for brivanib treatment, where it may have direct anti-proliferative effects in addition to its\u0027 anti-angiogenic effects.","title":"Amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 in breast cancer and the effects of brivanib alaninate.","pubmedId":"20024612"}
