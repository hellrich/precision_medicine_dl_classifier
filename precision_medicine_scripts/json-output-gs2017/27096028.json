They regulate cell cycle, apoptosis and cancer stemness, metastasis and chemoresistance by controlling their target gene expressions. Here, we mainly discuss the potential uses of miRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis. We also shed light on the important corresponding miRNA targets and on the major regulators of miRNAs. Furthermore, we discuss miRNA activity in assessing the prognosis and recurrence of CRC as well as in modulating responsiveness to chemotherapy. Based on the various pro-oncogenic/anti-oncogenic roles of miRNAs, the advantages of a therapeutic strategy based on the delivery of miRNA mimics are also mentioned. Together, miRNA seems to be an excellent tool for effectively monitoring and targeting CRC. ","title":"MicroRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"27096028"}
