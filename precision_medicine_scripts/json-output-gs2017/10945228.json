Abnormal surface expression of the neural-cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has been noted to be highly associated with SCLC. We examined the ability and efficiency of a streptavidin-Protein A (ST-PA) fusion protein complexed with an anti-NCAM monoclonal antibody (Mab) to transfer biotinylated beta-galactosidase into human SCLC cell lines NCI-H69, NCI-H526, and NCI-H446. When the surface molecule NCAM was targeted with this system, more than 99% of the targeted cells internalized and exhibited beta-galactosidase activity. In addition, we evaluated cytotoxic activity against SCLC lines NCI-H69 and NCI-H526 by efficient delivery of biotinylated glucose oxidase using the same ST-PA/anti-NCAM Mab complex. Cytotoxicity of the transduced cells (SCLC) was 10-fold and 100-fold greater, respectively, than the glucose oxidase control. This system could be widely applied for specific therapy of cancer cells by targeting unique surface molecules (antigens) using the corresponding Mab/ST-PA complex to transfer a variety of effector molecules; e.g., immunotoxic compounds, into target cells with a high degree of efficiency and specificity.","title":"Specific cell targeting for delivery of toxins into small-cell lung cancer using a streptavidin fusion protein complex.","pubmedId":"10945228"}
