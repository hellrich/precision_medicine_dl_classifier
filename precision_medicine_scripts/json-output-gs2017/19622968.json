She underwent a robotic hysterectomy and was found to have no myometrial invasion or distant disease. Genetic testing revealed the patient to have the familial germline PTEN mutation.\nThe strikingly young age of onset of this patient\u0027s endometrial cancer highlights the need for additional study to better understand Cowden syndrome and to determine what endometrial cancer screening and preventive strategies are needed.","title":"Endometrial cancer in an adolescent: a possible manifestation of Cowden syndrome.","pubmedId":"19622968"}
