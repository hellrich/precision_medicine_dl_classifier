Although results are poor, surgical resection is considered the only curative therapeutic intervention for pancreatic cancer, thereby emphasizing the significance of effective diagnostic and prognostic tools to improve outcomes. As such, biomarkers play a promising role in the development of personalized treatments for patients with pancreatic cancer. Prognostic biomarkers, such as serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in particular, as well as cancer stem cell markers, provide valuable insight into the biological processes of an individual and their likely course of disease. This, consequently, allows for the assessment of optimal therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, current efforts target putative predictive biomarkers such as BRCA2, PALB2, and SPARC so as to determine their influence on tumor response on targeted therapies. As research progresses, more evidence will provide clinicians with guidelines on the utilization of biomarkers to accurately stage and tailor personalized treatment to the needs of specific patients with pancreatic cancer.
