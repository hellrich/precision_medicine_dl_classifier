A secondary point mutation (T790M) in the inhibitor binding site has been linked to the acquired resistance against those first generation therapeutics. Herein, we describe the lead optimization of a series of reversible, pan-mutant (L858R, del746-750, T790M/L858R, and T790M/del746-750) EGFR inhibitors. By use of a noncovalent double mutant (T790M/L858R and T790M/del746-750) selective EGFR inhibitor (2) as a starting point, activities against the single mutants (L858R and del746-750) were introduced through a series of structure-guided modifications. The in vitro ADME-PK properties of the lead molecules were further optimized through a number of rational structural changes. The resulting inhibitor (21) exhibited excellent cellular activity against both the single and double mutants of EGFR, demonstrating target engagement in vivo and ADME-PK properties that are suitable for further evaluation. The reversible, noncovalent inhibitors described complement the covalent pan-mutant EGFR inhibitors that have shown encouraging results in recent clinical trials.","title":"Discovery of a Noncovalent, Mutant-Selective Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor.","pubmedId":"27564586"}
