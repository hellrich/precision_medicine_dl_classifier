Forty-five patients (mean age, 64 years; range, 44-83 years)-34 patients deemed unresectable because of arterial involvement and 11 patients deemed unresectable because of extensive venous involvement-were treated with 6 cycles of GTX. Those with arterial involvement were treated with GX/RT after chemotherapy.\nThe GTX and GX/RT treatments were tolerated with the expected drug-related toxicities. There were no bowel perforations, cases of pancreatitis, or delayed strictures. Among those with arterial involvement, 29 underwent subsequent resection, with 20 (69%) achieving R0 resections. All 11 patients with venous-only involvement underwent resection, with 8 achieving R0 resections and 3 achieving complete pathologic responses. For the arterial arm, the 1-year survival rate was 71% (24 of 34 patients), and the median survival was 29 months (95% confidence interval, 21-38 months). Thirteen patients (38%) have not relapsed (range, 5-49+ months). For the venous arm, the median survival has not been reached at more than 42 months. Six patients (55%) in the venous arm did not experience recurrence (range, 6.2-42+ months).\nGTX plus GX/RT is an effective neoadjuvant regimen that can be safely administered to patients up to at least the age of 83 years. It is associated with a high response rate, a high rate of R0 resections, and prolonged overall survival.","title":"Neoadjuvant gemcitabine, docetaxel, and capecitabine followed by gemcitabine and capecitabine/radiation therapy and surgery in locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25492104"}
