This report provides a comprehensive review on the diagnosis and management of this tumor in children and adolescents, including its oncogenesis and associated syndromes. Surgery remains a mainstay of treatment, but there are no standard guidelines available at this time regarding the best practice for multimodality therapy as our understanding of the biology of GIST is still in evolution. Therefore, pediatric patients with GIST should be ideally treated in the context of clinical trials at specialized, multidisciplinary centers throughout the course of their disease, especially because these patients may live for years after diagnosis.","title":"Pediatric gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","pubmedId":"22248968"}
