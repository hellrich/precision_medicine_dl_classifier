Patients without coronary artery lesions were excluded. The severity of coronary artery lesions is expressed as the Gensini score and the morphology is classified according to Rosch\u0027s classification. The distribution of coronary artery lesions did not differ significantly between the 4 groups. The Gensini score was significantly higher in the hypercholesterolemia group than in the other groups (p \u003c 0.05). Short concentric lesions were more frequent in the hypercholesterolemia group than in the control group (p \u003c 0.01), and tubular regular lesions were more frequent in the hypertension and diabetes groups than in the control group (p \u003c 0.01). These results suggest that hypercholesterolemia has a greater influence on the severity of coronary artery lesions than does hypertension or diabetes, and that the progression of coronary atherosclerosis may differ among patients with these risk factors.","title":"Effect of coronary risk factors on coronary angiographic morphology in patients with ischemic heart disease.","pubmedId":"9192238"}
