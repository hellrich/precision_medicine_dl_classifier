The tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib malate (Sutent * ) is established as second-line treatment for the management of GIST after disease progression on, or intolerance to, first-line imatinib treatment. Several published reviews give guidance on management of side effects in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib, but fewer publications cover side-effect management in patients with GIST.\nUsing published articles and abstracts, prescribing information, and personal experience in managing patients with GIST at a specialized center of excellence for cancer care, I review side-effect management recommendations for patients with GIST treated with sunitinib and provide an overview of GIST.\nSunitinib has a well described side-effect profile: most side effects occurring in patients with GIST can be easily managed by standard medical intervention and/or dose modification.\nCare of patients with GIST can be enhanced through communication, support, knowledge, and education, with the goal of providing effective therapy and optimal symptom control.","title":"Current management of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor receiving the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib.","pubmedId":"25912466"}
