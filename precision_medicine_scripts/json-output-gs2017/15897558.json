Treatment of KM12L4a human colon cancer cells with CHIR-258 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and PDGFRbeta phosphorylation and reduction of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) levels, indicating modulation of target receptors and downstream signaling. In vivo administration of CHIR-258 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition and tumor regressions, including large, established tumors (500-1,000 mm(3)). Immunohistochemical analysis showed a reduction of phosphorylated PDGFRbeta and phosphorylated ERK in tumor cells after oral dosing with CHIR-258 compared with control tumors. These changes were accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation rate and reduced intratumoral microvessel density. CHIR-258 inhibited the phosphorylation of PDGFRbeta and ERK phosphorylation in tumors within 2 hours following dosing and the inhibitory activity was sustained for \u003e24 hours. Significant antitumor activity was observed with intermittent dosing schedules, indicating a sustained biological activity.\nThese studies provide evidence that biological activity of CHIR-258 in tumors correlates with efficacy and aids in the identification of potential biomarkers of this multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. CHIR-258 exhibits properties that make it a promising candidate for clinical development in a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies.","title":"In vivo target modulation and biological activity of CHIR-258, a multitargeted growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor, in colon cancer models.","pubmedId":"15897558"}
