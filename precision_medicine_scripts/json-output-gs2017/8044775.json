The genes most frequently amplified were CDK4 and SAS (18 of 19 cases). MDM2 was coamplified with CDK4 and SAS in 11 tumors while one glioblastoma showed only MDM2 amplification. Some amplicons additionally included GADD153 (9 cases), GLI (6 cases), A2MR (3 cases), and the anonymous locus D12S8 (2 cases). Either MDM2 or CDK4 and SAS showed the highest amplification level in each individual amplicon and amplification of these genes was consistently accompanied by strong overexpression. Our results thus suggest CDK4, SAS, and MDM2 as main targets for the amplification; however, the possibility exists that all amplicons share a common amplified region between MDM2 and CDK4/SAS which might contain one or more as yet unidentified genes.","title":"Amplification of multiple genes from chromosomal region 12q13-14 in human malignant gliomas: preliminary mapping of the amplicons shows preferential involvement of CDK4, SAS, and MDM2.","pubmedId":"8044775"}
