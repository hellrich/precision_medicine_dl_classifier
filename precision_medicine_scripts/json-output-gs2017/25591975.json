We present here, a new method for the rapid detection of the two most common EGFR mutations (delE746-A750 and L858R) from clinical samples. The methodology involves the combination of newly designed mutation-specific primers and a novel real-time PCR machine with an innovative thermo-control mechanism that enables ultrarapid PCR. We evaluated this method using a cell mixture composed of various ratios of lung cancer cells harboring mutated or wild-type EGFR, lung cancer tissues obtained by surgery, and a cytology sample obtained by bronchoscopy from a lung cancer patient. In the cell mixture analysis, our method detected 0.1% of cells with delE746-A750 and 1% of cells with L858R among cells with wild-type EGFR. In 143 lung cancer tissues, the result of this assay was concordant with those of direct sequencing in 138 samples. The five samples with discordant results were tested using a PCR-Invader assay and the result matched those of our method at 100%. We also successfully detected EGFR mutations in the lavage obtained from a lung cancer patient. The turnaround time for this method was \u003c10 min, and all steps could be accomplished in \u003c50 min after sample collection. Thus, our novel PCR method offers a rapid, simple, and less expensive test for EGFR mutations and can be applied as a point-of-care diagnostic test.","title":"A new rapid method for detecting epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25591975"}
