Though the hilar lymph node metastasis was eminent, primary site was difficult to identify by using computed tomography (CT). SUV max with positron emission (PET)-CT in the case suggested the lung cancer in the emphysematous lung and it became an operation. The pathology diagnosis of the excision lungs was T4 (pml) N1 (#10, 12u) M0 stage IIIB. It was generated in emphysema, and it seemed that an adenocarcinoma with micropapillary component that did typical progress.","title":"[Micropapillary component in lung adenocarcinoma generated in emphysema].","pubmedId":"17642214"}
