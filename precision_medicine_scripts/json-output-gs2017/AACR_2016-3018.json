In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, KRAS mutation occurs in 90-95% of cases and is often coupled with inactivation of CDKN2A (\u003e90% incidence), typically by homozygous deletion. Based on the high incidence of these genetic events, the present study addresses the hypothesis that dual targeting of MEK and CDK4/6 represents a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A panel of primary and high passage xenograft models was screened for in vitro synergy to the antiproliferative effects of the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Two models that emerged as highly sensitive to this combination treatment strategy, L3.6pl and UM59, both exhibited G1 cell cycle arrest that was significantly more pronounced in response to the combination compared to either single agent. In vivo studies were subsequently carried out to evaluate the efficacy of this combination in tumor-bearing mice. Mice implanted subcutaneously with L3.6pl or UM59 cells were treated daily by oral gavage for ten days with trametinib (3 mg/kg), palbociclib (100 mg/kg), or the combination of these two agents at these doses. Consistent with in vitro synergy observations, both models proved to be exceptional responders in vivo to this combination treatment strategy, showing a robust response to the combination not seen with either single agent. These results suggest that the combined inhibition of MEK and CDK4/6 may offer a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Studies are ongoing to identify molecular determinants of response in pancreatic tumors that are highly sensitive to this combination approach to guide future patient enrichment strategies.","title":"Cotargeting MEK and CDK4/6 to treat pancreatic adenocarcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3018"}
