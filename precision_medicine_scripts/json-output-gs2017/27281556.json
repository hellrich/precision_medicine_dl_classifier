Tumor samples were classified into each subtype using the research-based PAM50 classifier. Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant antiestrogen therapy was allowed. Patients with extensive symptomatic visceral disease were excluded. Treatment effects were evaluated using interaction tests.\nPrimary and secondary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival.\nThe median (range) age was 62 (31-94) years. Intrinsic subtype was the strongest prognostic factor independently associated with progression-free survival and overall survival in all patients, and in patients with HER2-negative (n \u003d 644) or HER2-positive (n \u003d 157) diseases. Median progression-free survival differed across the intrinsic subtypes of clinically HER2-negative disease: luminal A (16.9 [95% CI, 14.1-19.9] months), luminal B (11.0 [95% CI, 9.6-13.6] months), HER2-enriched (4.7 [95% CI, 2.7-10.8] months), and basal-like (4.1 [95% CI, 2.5-13.8] months). Median OS also differed across the intrinsic subtypes: luminal A (45 [95% CI, 41-not applicable {NA}] months), luminal B (37 [95% CI, 31-42] months), HER2-enriched (16 [95% CI, 10-NA] months), and basal-like (23 [95% CI, 12-NA] months). Patients with HER2-negative/HER2-enriched disease benefited from lapatinib therapy (median PFS, 6.49 vs 2.60 months; progression-free survival hazard ratio, 0.238 [95% CI, 0.066-0.863]; interaction P \u003d .02).\nThis is the first study to reveal an association between intrinsic subtype and outcome in first-line HR-positive metastatic breast cancer. Patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative disease with a HER2-enriched profile may benefit from lapatinib in combination with endocrine therapy. The clinical value of intrinsic subtyping in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer warrants further investigation, but patients with luminal A/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer might be good candidates for letrozole monotherapy in the first-line setting regardless of visceral disease and number of metastases.","title":"Prognostic Value of Intrinsic Subtypes in Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Treated With Letrozole With or Without Lapatinib.","pubmedId":"27281556"}
