In an effort to study the biological basis of this epistasis, gene targeting was used to create isogenic sets of human cancer cells differing only in presence or absence of endogenous oncogenic K-Ras or wild-type B-Raf. Whereas cells lacking the K-Ras oncogene were unable to efficiently form xenograft tumors, isogenic cells retaining activated K-Ras but deleted for B-Raf remained highly tumorigenic. Deletion of oncogenic K-Ras failed to reduce the activation state of B-Raf or ERK1/2, despite the requirement of oncogenic K-Ras for tumorigenesis. Genechip analysis revealed numerous genes in which the regulation by oncogenic K-Ras did not require B-Raf. These studies suggest that despite the mutual exclusivity of K-Ras and B-Raf mutations in human cancer and the well-described role for Raf proteins as Ras effectors, B-Raf is dispensable for K-Ras-mediated oncogenesis in a human cancer cell line. Additional studies are required to demonstrate the generalizability of these unexpected findings.","title":"B-Raf is dispensable for K-Ras-mediated oncogenesis in human cancer cells.","pubmedId":"15026326"}
