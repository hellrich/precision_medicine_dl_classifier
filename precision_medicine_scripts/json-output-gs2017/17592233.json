The present study evaluated tumor staging and resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PaC) according to previous Body Mass Index (BMI), BMI on admission and DM duration.\nA retrospective analysis of 151 consecutive patients with PaC was performed: 73 were evaluated according to BMI preceding tumor-related weight loss and BMI on admission; 118 according to DM diagnosis; and 38 were assessed according to DM duration (less than 1 year [recent-onset] versus more than 2 years [long-standing]).\nThere was no difference in the prevalence of tumor stage III or IV between previously normal weight and overweight/obese patients (56 vs. 42%, NS). Tumor resection rate was higher in previously obese than in previously lean patients (58 vs. 24%, p \u003c 0.05). Tumor staging and resection were similar between normal weight and overweight/obese patients considering BMI on admission and diagnosis of DM. Weight loss was more pronounced in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients (21.7 vs. 13.3%, p \u003c 0.01). Tumor staging and resection were similar between recent-onset and long-standing diabetic patients.\nTumor resection rate was lower in previously normal weight patients. Diabetics lost more weight than non-diabetic patients. Neither BMI on admission nor the presence of DM nor DM duration influenced tumor staging or resection in PaC patients.","title":"Analysis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumor staging and resection according to previous body mass index and diabetes duration.","pubmedId":"17592233"}
