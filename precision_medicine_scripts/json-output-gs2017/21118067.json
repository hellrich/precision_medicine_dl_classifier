Those aged up to 26 years were able to receive the vaccine free of charge from their general practitioner until June 2009. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of participation in the national human papillomavirus vaccination and cervical cancer screening programs and knowledge of cervical cancer, Pap testing and the human papillomavirus within this at risk group.\nthe sample comprised 274 women, mean age 21.75 (SD\u003d2.14) years who were recruited using snowball sampling. Participants completed an online questionnaire between May and July 2008 that assessed knowledge, awareness and attitudes towards cervical cancer, Pap testing and the human papillomavirus vaccine, as well as participation in Pap testing and uptake of the vaccine.\njust over 84% of the participants reported receiving the human papillomavirus vaccine and 60% were following the national guidelines in relation to cervical cancer screening. Participants who reported screening correctly for cervical cancer were more likely to be sexually active compared to under-screeners, but underscreeners were more likely to be in a relationship. Overall, knowledge of cervical cancer, Pap testing and the human papillomavirus was good but some misconceptions were present.\nwhile knowledge of the human papillomavirus, cervical cancer and Pap testing was good, further education is required to correct common misconceptions about the human papillomavirus vaccine and to improve vaccination uptake in this population.","title":"Knowledge of cervical cancer, pap testing and the human papillomavirus among young Australian women.","pubmedId":"21118067"}
