These genetic alterations were compared with patient demographics and clinicopathological characteristics of the tumors.\nMutation of the K-ras gene was present in 18 of 126 (14.3%) biliary tract cancers. K-ras mutation was present in 11 of 18 (61.1%) ampullary cancers, 5 of 33 (15.2%) bile duct cancers, and 2 of 75 (2.7%) gallbladder cancers (P \u003d 0.000001). The mean survival of patients who had bile duct carcinomas with K-ras mutation was 3.0 +/- 2.2 months compared with 15.5 +/- 12.5 months for those without mutation (P \u003d 0.03) but was not different for other tumor sites. p53 overexpression was present in 34 of 123 (27.6%) cancers. MSI-high (allelic shifts in 40% or more loci or alteration of the TGFbetaRII gene) was present in 4 of 126 (3.2%) biliary tract cancers without hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. MSI-high was more common in mucinous adenocarcinomas (P \u003d 0.006) and in patients with early age of onset of cancer (P \u003d 0.04).\nThe genetic alterations in biliary tract cancers are dependent on the tumor subsite, histology, and age of onset and are associated with prognosis.","title":"K-ras mutation, p53 overexpression, and microsatellite instability in biliary tract cancers: a population-based study in China.","pubmedId":"12374683"}
