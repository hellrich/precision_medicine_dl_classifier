We established a transgenic mouse model that expresses tumors highly resembling human NSCLC harboring EML-ALK fusion. We aimed to test EML4-ALK transgenic mouse model as a platform for assessing efficacy of ALK inhibitor and examining mechanisms of acquired resistance to ALK inhibitor.\nTransgenic mouse lines harboring LoxP-STOP-LoxP- FLAG tagged human EML4-ALK (variant 1) transgene was established using C57BL/6N mice. The transgenic mouse model with highly lung-specific, inducible expression of EML4-ALK fusion protein was established by crossing the EML4-ALK transgenic mice with mice expressing Cre-estrogen receptor (Cre-ERT2) fusion protein under the control of surfactant associated protein C (SPC) gene. Expression of EML4-ALK transgene was induced by intraperitoneally injecting with tamoxifen. When the lung tumor was observed, an ALK inhibitor crizotinib was treated for 2 weeks and tumor shrinkage was measured.\nEML4-ALK tumor developed after one week of tamoxifen treatment. EML4-ALK was strongly expressed in the lung, but not in other organs. ALK and Flag expressions were observed on immunohistochemistry. Treatment of EML4-ALK tumor-bearing mice with crizotinib for 2 weeks induced dramatic shrinkage of tumors with no signs of toxicity. Furthermore, prolonged treatment of crizotinib led to acquired resistance in tumors, resulting in regrowth and disease progression. The resistant tumor nodules revealed acquired ALK G1202R mutations.\nEML4-ALK transgenic mouse model for drug resistance study was successfully established with short duration of tumorigenesis. This model should be a strong preclinical model for testing efficacy of ALK TKIs, providing a useful tool for investigating the mechanisms of acquired resistance and pursuing novel treatment strategies in ALK-positive lung cancer.","title":"Establishment of a conditional transgenic mouse model recapitulating EML4-ALK-positive human non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"27836576"}
