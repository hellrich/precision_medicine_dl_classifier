This PI3K involved in regulation of cellular growth, transformation, adhesion, apoptosis, survival and motility. In some situations the PI3K/Akt pathway get altered due to mutation in PIK3CA gene produced oncogenic event in human malignancy.\nThe goal of this work is to describe the PI3K signaling pathway including mutational activation of PIK3CA gene and inhibitors have been developed or under clinical trials for the targeting of PI3K or PI3KR kinases.\nVarious inhibitors such as Morpholine, pyrimidines, benzenesulfonamide, pyridopyrimidinone, imidazo[1,5]naphthyridine, benzeneacylhydrazones, thienopyrimidine, aminopyridopyrimidine, imidazopyridine, imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, thiazolopyrimidinone, quinolines and quinoxalines, thieno[3,2-b]pyran-7-one, morpholino-1,3-benzoxazines, quinalozinones, pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidines, benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)acetamide, aminopyrimidines, chalcone , azaindole, pyrazolo-pyrimidine and pyridine, thienobenzoxepin, phenylquinazolines , pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines , imidazolo-pyrimidine etc. were investigated under laboratory level as PI3K inhibitors in which few having PI3K and mTOR dual inhibitory activities.\nAfter a long term of prognostic standpoint, PIK3CA mutations discussed as a major target for various cancers. These PIK3CA mutations were found in various exon including 1,2,4,6,7,9,13,18 and 20 which may be a cause of different cancers such as breast, colon, ovarian, gastric, brain, lung etc. In clinical trials these mutations still remain question marks for presence or absence to the scientist regarding future perspective. The opinion of these studies is to development of more specific inhibitors of PI3K pathway which produce tremendous impact on various cancers developed due to PIK3CA mutations.","title":"Triggering PIK3CA mutations in PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis: Exploration of newer inhibitors and rational preventive strategies.","pubmedId":"27296758"}
