Standard immunohistochemistry analysis for mTOR pathway members PTEN, phos-S6, phos-4E-BP1, phos-mTOR, phos-AKT, p27, and ERG was performed. For all markers, histologic expression score was calculated as the sum of intensity Ã— extent of expression. In addition, for PTEN, presence of \"markedly decreased\" expression (any focal absence of expression) was also assessed. Expression status of all biomarkers was compared between tumor and paired benign tissue. Intercorrelation among markers was also performed.\nPTEN expression was seen in all 36 evaluable minute prostatic adenocarcinoma. Cytoplasmic phos-S6 was present in 32 of 36 tumors (89%). phos-S6 expression levels were higher in tumors compared with paired benign tissue (P \u003d .007). Cytoplasmic and nuclear phos-4E-BP1 was present in all 34 evaluable tumors. phos-4E-BP1 was significantly higher in cancer compared with normal tissue (P \u003c.0001). Only a minority of tumors demonstrating higher phos-S6 expression and phos-4E-BP1 (2 of 32 and 2 of 34, respectively) had associated \"markedly decreased\" PTEN expression.\nWe found evidence of activation of mTOR pathway in minute prostatic adenocarcinoma that appears to be unrelated to \"markedly decreased\" PTEN expression. The latter finding suggests an alternative signaling mechanism controlling mTOR activation in minute prostate carcinoma.","title":"Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway markers in minute adenocarcinoma of the prostate.","pubmedId":"24035134"}
