Related clinicopathological correlation was analyzed.\nEML4-ALK fusion gene was found in 4.1% (11/268) of the cases. One hundred and sixty four samples were verified by Sanger sequencing, and the overall coincidence of the results of two methods (Sanger sequencing and Real-time PCR) was 100%. Female patients (5.9%, 5/85), â‰¤ 60 years of age (4.3%, 6/140), non-smokers (6.8%, 8/118) and adenocarcinomas (7.6%, 10/132) had a higher mutation rate than that in male patients (3.3%, 6/183), \u003e 60 years of age (4.0%, 5/124), smokers (1.6%, 2/132) and squamous cell carcinomas (1.3%, 1/79), although no statistical significance in age (P \u003d 0.918), gender (P \u003d 0.503), smoking history (P \u003d 0.092) and histological type (P \u003d 0.094).\nChinese NSCLC patients have a 4.1% detection rate of EML4-ALK fusion gene in the tumor tissues. Female, non-smoker and adenocarcinoma histological subtype tend to be associated with a higher rate of EML4-ALK gene fusion.","title":"[Detection of EML4-ALK fusion gene in non-small cell lung cancer and its clinicopathologic correlation].","pubmedId":"23928533"}
