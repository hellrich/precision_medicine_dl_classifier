With reference to a large number of patients it can be demonstrated that too high a percentage (14%) are already inoperable at the first intervention and excision of the tumor is only possible in one quarter of the cases. Careful analysis shows that not inconsiderable survival times--often in astonishingly good condition--can be attained even with palliative measures. Major operation is particularly justified on the distal bile duct, because this gives a real chance of a cure. The essential chance, however, lies in early diagnosis of the malignant process: Surgical help is only possible with an operable state. And it must also not be forgotten that the initial symptoms of incipient carcinoma of the efferent biliary tracts are completely uncharacteristic, but that the sum of modern diagnostic methods permits early recognition.","title":"[The prognosis of cancers of the efferent bile ducts].","pubmedId":"7274930"}
