Recently, a G to A point mutation (E17K) was found in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1. We aimed to explore this mutation in cases of urothelial carcinoma. Using chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer, AKT1 E17K mutation was searched in 26 total RNA samples obtained from 26 patients known to have urothelial carcinoma. Mutation was found in one out of 26 (3.8%) patients - a 46 year old female with a low grade transitional cell carcinoma located to the lamina propria (Ta disease). Our finding is in line with previous studies showing AKT1 E17K mutation to be rare. Yet, further studies are required to determine whether this mutation is indeed related to less aggressive disease and carries better prognosis.","title":"AKT1 E17 K pleckstrin homology domain mutation in urothelial carcinoma.","pubmedId":"19389506"}
