A combined modality approach with chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy has improved disease-free and overall survival rates for inflammatory breast cancer. Approximately 35% to 55% of patients treated with combined modality regimens remain disease-free and alive at 5 years.\nInduction combination chemotherapy administered with radiation therapy, mastectomy, both, or with additional chemotherapy favorably alters the natural history of inflammatory breast cancer. New drug combinations and high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow support are being evaluated to improve further patient survival.","title":"Inflammatory breast cancer: a review.","pubmedId":"1588366"}
