However, in families with 2 patients with CM, which represent the majority of familial melanoma, these factors have been rarely studied.\nWe investigated association of 3 clinical features with the presence of a CDKN2A mutation in a family by extent of CM family clustering (2 vs â‰¥3 patients with CM among first-degree relatives in a family).\nWe included 483 French families that comprised 387 families with 2 patients with CM (F2 families) and 96 families with 3 or more patients with CM (F3+ families). Three clinical factors were examined individually and in a joint analysis: median age at diagnosis younger than 50 years, and 1 or more patient in a family with multiple primary melanoma or with pancreatic cancer.\nThe frequency of CDKN2A mutations was higher in F3+ families (32%) than in F2 families (13%). Although early age at melanoma diagnosis and occurrence of multiple primary melanoma in 1 or more patient were significantly associated with the risk of a CDKN2A mutation in F2 families, early age at melanoma diagnosis and occurrence of pancreatic cancer in a family were significantly associated with CDKN2A mutations in F3+ families.\nThe study was not population based.\nThis study shows that factors associated with CDKN2A mutations differ by extent of CM family clustering. It indicates that, in France, families with 2 patients with CM are eligible for genetic testing especially when there is an early age at CM diagnosis and/or 1 or more patients with multiple primary melanoma.","title":"Familial melanoma: clinical factors associated with germline CDKN2A mutations according to the number of patients affected by melanoma in a family.","pubmedId":"22841127"}
