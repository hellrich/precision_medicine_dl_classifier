Certain risk factors can increase the development of CRC, including diet and inheritance. Several studies have shown that there is a potential link between obesity and CRC. Adipose tissue is known to be a largest endocrine organ in the body, with the ability to produce various cytokines including adiponectin. Two types of adiponectin receptor, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, have been detected in various cancer tissues such as CRC. There is mounting evidence that AdipoR1 signaling occurs mainly through 5\u0027 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adiponectin inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth via activation of AMPK, thereby suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Thus, adiponectin replacement-based therapies may represent a novel approach in CRC cell growth inhibition in early stages. AdipoRon is an adiponectin-like synthetic small molecule that activated both adiponectin receptors 1 and 2. We hypothesize that AdipoRon has antiproliferative effects of adiponectin and may suppress the CRC cell growth. With clarification of this drug\u0027s role in CRC, it can be used as chemoprevention in patients at risk of developing the disease.","title":"AdipoRon: a possible drug for colorectal cancer prevention?","pubmedId":"26282004"}
