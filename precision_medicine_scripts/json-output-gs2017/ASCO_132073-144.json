More than half of all pancreatic cancers are stage IV at diagnosis, where, systemic chemotherapy is used with the goal of life prolongation as well as palliation (J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;15(6):2403-13.)The patient characteristics and health system factors that drive the use of systemic therapy are unknown.  Methods:    This is a retrospective study of stage IV pancreatic cancer patients (n\u003d140,366) diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 in the NCDB. NCDB contains ~70% of new cancer diagnosis from \u003e1,500 accredited cancer programs in the United States and Puerto Rico. Chi-square test was used to determine any differences in characteristics of patients who did or did not receive systemic therapy.  Results:    Our study demonstrated that only 49% of stage IV pancreatic cancer patients received systemic therapy. The use of systemic therapy is significantly lower in female, black/hispanic, patients \u003e40 years (49% vs 69% in \u003c40 years), those without insurance or with Medicare and Medicaid, higher Charlson comorbidity score, poor economic and educational status and in non-academic centers (Table).  Conclusions:    This is the largest study to evaluate the determinants of systemic therapy use in stage IV pancreatic cancer. The use of systemic therapy was significantly lower in female, black/hispanic, patients \u003e40 years and with higher Charlson comorbidity score. In addition, economic and educational level, hospital and insurance types can affect the use of systemic therapy. Understanding the barriers in the use of systemic therapy can optimize cancer care.
