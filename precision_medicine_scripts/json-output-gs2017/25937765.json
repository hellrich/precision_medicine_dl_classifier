{"keywords":["Chronic pancreatitis","Pancreatic cancer"],"genes":["CA19-9"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Data exists to indicate a definite association between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. The strength of this association varies between various causes of pancreatitis, with hereditary and tropical pancreatitis more likely to result in malignancy. Pathogenesis may involve genetic factors, diabetes, smoking and alcohol consumption. Clinically a significant overlap exists between the two conditions, with histology difficult to obtain and interpret in this setting. Biomarkers like CA19-9 and others may be useful, as is a variety of newer imaging modalities. Treatment needs to be individualised as surgery offers the only chance of cure, albeit in but a few.
