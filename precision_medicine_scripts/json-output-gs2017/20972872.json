However, the prognostic role of K-ras status is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between k-ras status and addition of oxaliplatin to fluorouracil plus leucovorin (FOLFOX) chemotherapy in CRC patients with curative surgical resection.\nSixty-six patients with stage II or III CRC were treated with FOLFOX or fluorouracil plus leucovorin (FL) followed by curative surgery between January 2004 and October 2007. K-ras status was assessed by direct sequencing.\nFifteen patients (22.7%) had K-ras mutations of codon 12 (11/15) or codon 13 (4/15). There were no significant differences in clinicopathological parameters, such as age, sex, stage, or adjuvant regimen between the wild-type K-ras and mutant K-ras. With a median follow-up of 41.6 months (range 25.1-72.3 months), median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were not reached. With regard to K-ras status, DFS and OS were not statistically different (P \u003d 0.269 and P \u003d 0.917, respectively). Even in the group treated with FOLFOX only, neither DFS (P \u003d 0.651) nor OS (P \u003d 0.265) was significantly different according to K-ras status. With the exception of tumor location in DFS and OS, no differences in other variables were observed. Proximal colon cancer patients had a longer DFS than distal CRC patients (P \u003d 0.079); this trend was maintained only in the wild-type K-ras group (P \u003d 0.051).\nThese results showed that K-ras status was not associated with clinical outcome in patients treated with adjuvant FOLFOX.","title":"Clinical impact of K-ras mutation in colorectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant FOLFOX.","pubmedId":"20972872"}
