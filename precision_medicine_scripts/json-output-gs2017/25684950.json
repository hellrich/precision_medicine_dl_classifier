The clinicopathologic features, including sex, age, location, tumor size, histology, mitotic rate, immunohistochemical features, genetic status and survival data, were analyzed.\nThe median age was 55 years (range: 29-80 years), and male:female ratio was 1:1.04. The most common site was in the mesentery (n \u003d 15) followed by the retroperitoneum (n \u003d 13) and omentum (n \u003d 8). The median tumor size was 9.0 cm (range: 2.6-30.0 cm) and the median mitotic rate was 5.0/50HPF. (1/50 - 185/50). KIT was analyzed in 16, which revealed 10 cases with wild-type KIT and 6 cases with an exon 11 mutation. Among 51 patients, 31 patients had undergone surgery, and 10 had unresectable disease and had taken palliative imatinib, which resulted in 22.7 mo of progression-free survival. Of the patients who had undergone surgery, 18 did not take adjuvant imatinib, and 8 of these were categorized as \"high risk\" according to the risk criteria. However, the relapse-free survival was not different (P \u003d 0.157) between two groups.\nBecause the biologic behaviors of GISTs differ according to the location of the tumor, a more stratified strategy is required for managing EGISTs including incorporation of molecular features.","title":"Retrospective analysis of extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"25684950"}
