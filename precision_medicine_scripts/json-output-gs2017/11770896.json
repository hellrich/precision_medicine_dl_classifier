A 58-year-old man with right ear hearing loss since childhood presented with a two year history of dizziness and vertigo. Neuroradiological studies showed a large mass arising from the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The lesion was resected and microscopic examination revealed a cholesterol granuloma with a small component of cholesteatoma. It is important to distinguish between cholesterol granuloma and cholesteatoma because of treatment differences. However, these two entities can occasionally be seen together and rare giant variants have been described.","title":"July 2001: 58-year-old man with a temporal bone mass.","pubmedId":"11770896"}
