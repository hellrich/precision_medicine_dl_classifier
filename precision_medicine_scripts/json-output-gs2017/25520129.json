The positive expression rate of Annexin A2 and the MVD in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues was higher than that in in adjacent normal tissues (p\u003c0.005). Expression of Annexin A2 and MVD correlated with histological grade (p\u003c0.05). MVD of cancers in TNM stage IIb was higher than that in TNM stageI~IIa (p\u003c0.026). Cancerous tissues with Annexin A2 staining grade 3+ had lower MVD than the tissues with the other Annexin A2 staining grade (p\u003c0.05). Patients with high MVD had worse prognosis. However , our study did not confirm Annexin A2 was an independent risk factor for patients with PDAC. We confirmed MVD labeled by CD105 was an independent risk factor for patients with PDAC and had moderate predictive value of prognosis.
