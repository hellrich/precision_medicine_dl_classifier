Ovarian tumors are divided into a copious number of different groups reflecting their different features. The present study analyzed 187 ovarian tumors (39 sex-cord stromal tumors, 22 borderline tumors and 126 carcinomas) for the expression of the high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) gene, for mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 1, cytosolic (IDH1), isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 2, mitochondrial (IDH2) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) genes, and for methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that HMGA2 was expressed in 74.5% of the samples (120/161). A truncated transcript of HMGA2 was identified in 11 cases. A novel truncated form of HMGA2 was found in 4 serous high-grade carcinomas. Only 4 tumors (4/185) showed the TERT C228T mutation. No IDH1 or IDH2 mutations were found. Methylation of the promoter of MGMT was found in 2 borderline tumors (2/185). HMGA2 was expressed, in its truncated and native form, in different ovarian tumors, even the less aggressive types, underscoring the general importance of this gene in ovarian tumorigenesis. Mutations involving TERT, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, are rare events in ovarian tumors.","title":"A novel truncated form of HMGA2 in tumors of the ovaries.","pubmedId":"27446471"}
