However, the reasons that lead to loss of tolerance and to development of autoimmunity in DLE remain unclear. In the present paper, we investigated serum levels of the regulatory cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and interleukin (IL)-10 in 25 newly diagnosed patients with DLE, 15 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 10 with psoriasis, 10 with atopic dermatitis (AD) and 20 healthy controls (HC). TGF-β serum levels were significantly lower in patients with DLE compared with patients with psoriasis and HC, while no differences were found between DLE, SLE and AD (medians: DLE: 28.49 ng/ml; psoriasis: 42.77 ng/ml; HC: 43.71 ng/ml; DLE vs. psoriasis: p \u003c 0.05; DLE vs. HC: p \u003c 0.05). IL-10 concentrations were reduced in DLE serum samples with respect to SLE, psoriasis, AD and HC (medians: DLE: 46.42 pg/ml; SLE: 127.64 pg/ml; psoriasis: 109.3 pg/ml; AD: 76.3 pg/ml; HC: 114.71 pg/ml; DLE vs. SLE: p \u003c 0.05; DLE vs. psoriasis: p \u003c 0.05; DLE vs. AD: p \u003c 0.05; DLE vs. HC: p \u003c 0.05). The downregulation of TGF-β and IL-10 in DLE may lead to defective immune suppression and thus to the generation of the tissue injury that is found in lupus patients.","title":"Serum levels of the regulatory cytokines transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-10 are reduced in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus.","pubmedId":"21372199"}
