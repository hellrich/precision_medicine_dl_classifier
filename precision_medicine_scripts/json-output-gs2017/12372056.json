Yet, in up to 40% of familial breast cancer cases, no mutations can be detected in either gene. Germline mutations in PTEN underlie two inherited syndromes: Cowden disease (CD) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS). The known association of CD with breast cancer risk made it plausible that germline mutations within PTEN may play a role in inherited predisposition to breast cancer. The nine coding exons of the PTEN gene were screened for harboring germline mutations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) complemented by sequencing, in two subsets of Israeli patients: 12 patients clinically diagnosed with BRRS, and 89 women with an apparent inherited predisposition to breast cancer, some with salient features of CD. Two of three familial BRRS patients exhibited novel germline mutations in PTEN: a missense mutation changing methionine to arginine at codon 134, and insertion of two nucleotides (CA) at cDNA position 1215 resulting in a frameshift at codon 61 and a premature stop at codon 99. Among 89 high-risk women, two missense mutations were detected in exon 4: A to C change at cDNA position 1279 resulting in a change of aspargine to threonine at codon 82 (N82T), and a G to an A alteration in 1269 which alters threonine to alanine at codon 78 (T78A), a non-conservative missense mutation. This study suggests that PTEN does not play a major role in predisposing to hereditary breast cancer in Israeli women, and that detection of PTEN mutations in BRRS patients is more likely in familial cases.","title":"Germline mutations in the PTEN gene in Israeli patients with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and women with familial breast cancer.","pubmedId":"12372056"}
