However, even when targeted therapy is effective, patients eventually develop resistance and better therapies in this setting are still being sought. Preliminary studies, from the ongoing BATTLE-2 clinical trial in chemo-refractory NSCLC, identified a number of molecular candidates portending to targeted therapy resistance, including the oncostatin M (OSM) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptors (OSMR, LIFR), both co-localized on a frequently amplified chromosome 5p region. In this study, we investigated the functional contribution of the OSM pathway to targeted therapy resistance in NSCLC.Materials and Methods: We analyzed OSM, OSMR, LIFR, and associated downstream pathways in a panel of OSMR-LIFR amplified (10) and diploid (10) NSCLC cell lines, in both mono- and co-culture experiments using human normal and lung cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We assessed the effect of OSM pathway stimulation and blockade on sensitivity to a variety of molecularly targeted agents. Further, we performed correlative studies using the BATTLE-2 molecular dataset.Results: OSM stimulation activated cell proliferation and survival pathways (AKT-mediated) through OSMR and LIFR. In addition, a dramatic JAK1/STAT3 pathway activation was predominant in OSMR amplified cells and was associated with EMT features. Co-culture experiments suggested a preferential paracrine activation of the OSM-STAT3 pathway, underscoring the importance of the microenvironment. Interestingly, OSM stimulation protected cells from drug-induced apoptosis in a STAT3-dependent manner. In the BATTLE-2 translational analysis, we also found that OSMR upregulation was significantly associated to STAT3 upregulation and EMT-gene expression signatures.Conclusions: Our data suggest that the OSM-OSMR/LIFR-STAT3 pathway causes EMT and contributes to molecular targeted therapy resistance in oncogene-addicted NSCLC cells, suggesting that this pathway could be a therapeutic target in NSCLC. Ongoing experiments are assessing therapeutic vulnerabilities and refining the signaling functionally involved.Supported by NIH-NCI CA155196 \u0026 2P50CA070907-16A1","title":"Oncostatin M receptor activation leads to molecular targeted therapy resistance in non-small cell lung cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-745"}
