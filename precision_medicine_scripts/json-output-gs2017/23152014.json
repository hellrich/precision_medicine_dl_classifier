We studied serum pancreatic enzyme increase associated with sorafenib treatment.\nIn a phase II study of Japanese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, a total of 131 patients received sorafenib 400 mg twice per day. Serum levels of lipase and amylase were measured on day 7 and every 3-4 weeks thereafter during treatment period. When grade 3 or 4 enzyme abnormalities were observed, ultrasound or computed tomography scan was performed to detect pancreatitis.\nThe incidence of all-grades lipase and amylase increases were 55. 7% and 38. 2%, respectively, while those of grade 3 or 4 were 30. 5% and 5. 3%, respectively. The majority of these events were observed in the first 3 weeks of sorafenib treatment. Grade 3 or 4 lipase increase was detected in 32 patients (24. 4%)on day 7 measurement. These abnormal elevations spontaneously resolved in all patients. Regarding grade 3 lipase increase, the median time to recovery to grade 2 and 1 were 7 and 14 days, respectively. Three patients required interruption of the treatment. No patient showed any clinical manifestation or abnormal imaging finding suggesting pancreatitis.\nPancreatic enzyme increases observed frequently under sorafenib treatment were transient and asymptomatic. They were not related to symptomatic pancreatitis.","title":"[Serum pancreatic enzyme elevation under treatment with sorafenib].","pubmedId":"23152014"}
