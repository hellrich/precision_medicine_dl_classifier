Unfortunately treatment options are limited and surgery is only a possible curative option if the disease is diagnosed at an early stage (5 yr. survival, 20-30 %). Molecular profiling may play a crucial role in the discovery of new (early) biomarkers and treatment options for cholangiocarcinoma. Methods: Clinical records 104 cholangiocarcinoma patients (pts) at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center were reviewed. Only pts that had received surgical therapy were eligible for study. Variables collected included pt demographics, initial disease stage, tumor differentiation, and clinical (pre-existing) conditions. Tumor recurrence and pt survival from time of surgery was evaluated. Molecular profiling data was analyzed when present. Results: In our cohort we identified 41 pts with cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgery at LCCC. Clinical data was as follows: 20 males and 21 females. Average BMI at diagnosis was 25.8 kg/m2. Twelve pts had extrahepatic cancer, 20 intrahepatic, 5 gallbladder, 3 Hilar and 1 combined hepatocellular and bile duct cancer. Most tumors were stage T2 or T3 (61%), and were moderately (71%) to poorly differentiated (22%). Vascular or perineural invasion was identified in 46% of cases. Thirty-four percent and 37% had diabetes and hyperlipidemia, respectively. Tumor recurrence had occurred in 13 cases (32%), and median time to recurrence was 8.5 months (m). Median OS from surgery was 10.5 m (to date, 4 pts \u003e 36 m). Molecular profiles were obtained in 5 cases. Most frequently observed genetic mutations were related to tumor suppression (PTEN, 4 cases) and DNA synthesis, repair, and regulation (TOP2A [3x], TOPO1 [2x], TP53 [2x]). Conclusions: Five-year survival rates for cholangiocarcinomas are low. To improve outcomes, improved early detection methods and better treatment options are urgently needed. Increasing the frequency of molecular profiling can result in new prognostic biomarkers as well as the potential for new treatment ideas.","title":"Cholangiocarcinomas: A study of patient and disease characteristics and the potential use of tumor molecular profiling.","pubmedId":"ASCO_177165-195"}
