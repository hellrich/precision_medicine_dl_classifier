In contrast, serum IL-12 levels in malignant lymphoma patients did not change significantly. There were no significant differences in levels of other cytokines between 1 week and 3 weeks after transplantation in patients with lung cancer. The frequency of helper/inducer T cells was increased in peripheral blood 1 week after transplantation in both lung cancer and malignant lymphoma patients. There was a significant increase in activated T cell numbers following PBSCT. Furthermore, high levels of other activated T cells persisted in the post-PBSCT period in patients with lung cancer and the number of cytotoxic T cells significantly increased. Natural killer (NK) cell numbers also tended to increase, although that of malignant lymphoma was not significant. A strong correlation was observed between serum IL-12 levels and NK cell numbers and interferon-gamma levels in lung cancer not but in malignant lymphoma patients. The analysis of transfused PBSC showed that the numbers of granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units were similar in lung cancer and malignant lymphoma patients. However, the number of CD34+ cells was significantly higher in lung cancer than in malignant lymphoma patients. All of the CD34+ subpopulations were lower in percentage in patients with lung cancer than in patients with malignant lymphoma. In particular, the CD34+ CD33- subpopulation was significantly lower in percentage in lung cancer patients.\nOur findings suggest that PBSC in lung cancer are potent mediators of anticancer activity and that they might play an immunotherapeutic role against autologous malignant cells.","title":"Comparison of interleukin-12 with lung cancer and malignant lymphoma undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.","pubmedId":"11862469"}
