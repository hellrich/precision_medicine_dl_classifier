Of these deaths, 10,725 (6.6%) met criteria for rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung. Mortality rates from rheumatoid arthritis fell over the course of this study in both women and men. However, mortality rates from rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease increased 28.3% in women (to 3.1 per million persons in 2004) and declined 12.5% in men (to 1.5 per million persons in 2004). Because the rate of decline in rheumatoid arthritis outpaced rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease in men, the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease increased in both sexes over time.\nClinically significant RA-ILD occurs in nearly 10% of the RA population, and is associated with shortened survival and more severe underlying disease. Whereas overall mortality rates for RA have fallen, those associated with RA-ILD have increased significantly in older age groups.","title":"Rheumatoid arthritis-interstitial lung disease-associated mortality.","pubmedId":"20851924"}
