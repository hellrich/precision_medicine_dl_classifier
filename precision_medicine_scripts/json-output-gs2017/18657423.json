Cognitive impairment and aggressive behaviour is common. HSAN4 is caused by mutations in the NTRK1 gene coding for the tyrosine kinase receptor A. We present detailed description of a rare, mild HSAN4 phenotype associated with two novel NTRK1 mutations. This Swedish patient presents with an adult onset of painful Charcot arthropathy, prolonged wound healing, discrete polyneuropathy, hypohidrosis without further autonomic dysfunction and no cognitive affection.","title":"Expanded HSAN4 phenotype associated with two novel mutations in NTRK1.","pubmedId":"18657423"}
