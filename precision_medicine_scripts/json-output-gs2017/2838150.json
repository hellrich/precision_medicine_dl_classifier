By immunohistology, CgA could be detected in 11 of 18 classical SCLC cell lines, in a medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell line, and in only one of 13 variant- or non-SCLC cell lines. By radioimmunoassay, CgA could be detected in the cells and culture media of all of the classical SCLC cell lines tested. Many of the classical SCLC cell lines also produced calcitonin (CT). These studies demonstrate that CgA production is a common feature of SCLC cell lines, especially those with neuroendocrine characteristics.","title":"Demonstration of Chromogranin A in human neuroendocrine cell lines by immunohistology and immunoassay.","pubmedId":"2838150"}
