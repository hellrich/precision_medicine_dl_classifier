Lung adenocarcinoma is the most frequent subtype, and approximately 25% of the cases harbor activating mutations in the KRAS gene. To date, there is no effective treatment for patients carrying KRAS mutations due, at least in part, to the challenge posed by direct targeting of the KRAS oncoprotein. During the last decade, scientists have developed genetically engineered mouse models that faithfully recapitulate the natural history of the human tumors. These models have been used as a preclinical platform to validate a number of relevant downstream effectors of KRAS signaling. Targets displaying synthetic lethality with the KRAS oncoprotein have also been validated in these models. Here, we review these studies and discuss their potential value in the clinical setting. We also provide an outlook as of how to improve the significance of target validation studies in preclinical platforms.","title":"Modeling K-Ras-driven lung adenocarcinoma in mice: preclinical validation of therapeutic targets.","pubmedId":"26526121"}
