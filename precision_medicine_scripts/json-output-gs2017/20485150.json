Currently, margins are treated uniformly with tumor at or close to any margin considered of equal prognostic significance. The resection involves a mobilization phase freeing the posterior margin and anterior surface then a transection phase requiring lympho-vascular division forming the medial resection and pancreatic transection margin. The comparative assessment of the relative importance of tumor involvement of these different margins has not previously been investigated.\nRetrospective analysis of 148 consecutive resections for PDAC from 1996-2007 was performed. The individual (pancreatic transection, medial, posterior, and anterior surface) margins were separately identified and analyzed by a senior pathologist. An R1 resection was defined as microscopic evidence of tumor \u003c or \u003d 1 mm from a resection margin. R1Mobilization tumor extension included both R1Anterior and R1Posterior cases; while R1Transection included pancreatic neck/body transection, R1Medial and adjacent transection margins.\nR1 status was confirmed in 109 patients (74%). The medial (46%) and posterior (44%) margins were most commonly involved. R1 status was found to an independent predictor of poor outcome (P \u003c 0.001). R1Mobilization involvement only (n \u003d 48) was associated with a significantly longer median survival of 18.9 months (95% CI, 13.7-24.8) versus 11.1 months (95% CI, 7.1-15.0) for those with R1Transection tumor involvement (n \u003d 61) (P \u003c 0.001). There was no significant difference in the survival of the R1Mobilization compared with R0 group (P \u003d 0.52).\nFollowing pancreaticoduodenectomy for PDAC, involvement of the transection margins in contrast to mobilization margins defines a group whose outcome is significantly worse. This may impact upon the allocation of adjuvant therapy within the setting of randomized controlled trials.","title":"Positive mobilization margins alone do not influence survival following pancreatico-duodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20485150"}
