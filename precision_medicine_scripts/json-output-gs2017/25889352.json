To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of simultaneous cholangiocarcinoma and intramedullary spinal cord metastasis to be described in the medical literature.\nA 62-year-old Caucasian male with a cholangiocarcinoma presented pain around his left shoulder without any other symptoms. The results by magnetic resonance imaging and F18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computer tomography revealed an intramedullary metastasis at the C4 level, with spinal cord compression, and numerous secondary parenchymal brain metastases.\nThis patient was treated successfully with a combination of radiotherapy, corticosteroids, and chemotherapy. He experienced complete relief of the symptoms and showed improvements upon subsequent radiological evaluations.","title":"Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma: a case report.","pubmedId":"25889352"}
