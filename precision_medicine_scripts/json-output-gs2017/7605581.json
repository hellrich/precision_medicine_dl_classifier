Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis, we found no evidence for loss of DCC expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines, and allele loss only rarely in tumor biopsies. These findings suggest that abnormalities of RB1 and DCC are unlikely to play a major role in pancreatic carcinogenesis.","title":"Abnormalities of the RB1 and DCC tumor suppressor genes: uncommon in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"7605581"}
