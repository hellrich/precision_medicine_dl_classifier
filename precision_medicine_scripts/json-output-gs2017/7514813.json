The indications for radiotherapy are limited disease in small cell lung cancer, postoperatively in not completely operated non-small cell lung cancer, medically inoperable lung cancer and not resectable locally advanced disease. Combined-modality approaches using various permutations of three treatment modalities, namely surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are currently under investigation. Palliative radiation therapy is able to reduce life-threatening symptoms from intrathoracic tumor as well as from distant metastases.","title":"[Radiotherapy in malignant lung tumors].","pubmedId":"7514813"}
