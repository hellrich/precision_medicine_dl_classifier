A miR-218 mimic was transfected into HepG2 cells, and the cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed by MTT assay and flow cytometry, and the potential targets of miR-218 were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting.\nThe expressions of miR-218 in HCC tissues were significantly down-regulated compared to those in the adjacent tissues (P\u003c0.05). Down-regulation of miR-218 was found to correlate significantly with the tumor size (\u003e5 cm) and an advanced TNM stage (III+IV) (P\u003c0.05). Ectopic expression of miR-218 in HepG2 cells resulted in suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced cell apoptosis as well as the down-regulation of Bmi-1 and CDK6 mRNA and protein expressions (P\u003c0.05).\nThe low-expression of miR-218 is correlated with malignant clinicopathological characteristics of HCC, and miR-218 may inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis by down-regulating Bmi-1 and CDK6 in HCC.","title":"[MicroRNA-218 expression and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma].","pubmedId":"23996750"}
