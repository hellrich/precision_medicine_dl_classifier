However, some patients with ampullary carcinoma do not have jaundice at the time of diagnosis.\nClinicopathologic findings of 23 patients with ampullary carcinoma showing no visible jaundice (serum total bilirubin \u003c3.0 mg/dL) and 38 patients with ampullary carcinoma showing jaundice at the time of diagnosis were retrospectively compared.\nFifteen of 23 patients with nonjaundiced ampullary carcinoma complained of fever and/or abdominal pain. Five asymptomatic patients were found to have a dilated bile duct on screening ultrasound or to have a tumor-like swelling of the papilla of Vater during routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. There was no significant difference in age, sex, size, macroscopic type, histologic type, rates of duodenal invasion, pancreatic invasion, and lymph node metastasis, and prognosis between the two groups. The cumulative 5-year and 10-year survival rates of nonjaundiced patients were 70.2% and 49.0%, compared with 33.6% and 29.4% of jaundiced patients. Ten of the 23 nonjaundiced ampullary carcinomas (43%) were in Stage I, whereas 4 of the 38 jaundiced ampullary carcinomas (11%) were in Stage I (P \u003c 0.01). Mechanisms of nonjaundice in ampullary carcinoma were suspected to be determinant by the infiltrating pattern of the carcinoma to the lower portion of the bile duct.\nMechanisms of nonjaundice in ampullary carcinoma might be determined by the infiltrating pattern of the carcinoma to the lower portion of the bile. As a greater number of nonjaundiced ampullary carcinomas were in an early stage, detection of them may provide an improved clinical outcome.","title":"Clinicopathologic features of ampullary carcinoma without jaundice.","pubmedId":"16394879"}
