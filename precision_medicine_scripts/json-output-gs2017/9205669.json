Prevalence of hypertension was 28% in France and 31% in Northern Ireland (p \u003c 0.42). In France, 70% of hypertensive subjects were aware of their status, vs. 58% in Northern Ireland (p \u003c 0.10). Overall, 40% of subjects with a history of hypertension were untreated, and only 32% of the French and 12% of the Northern Irish subjects treated for hypertension (diet with/without drugs) were normotensive. The prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia was 46% in France and 48% in Northern Ireland (p \u003c 0.62). In France, 59% of hypercholesterolaemic subjects were aware of their status, vs. only 17% in Northern Ireland (p \u003c 0.0001). In both countries, half of those with a history of hypercholesterolaemia were untreated, and only 47% of the French and 43% of the Northern Irish patients treated for hypercholesterolaemia (diet with/without drugs) were controlled. While awareness of hypertension is comparable in France and Northern Ireland, awareness of hypercholesterolaemia is much lower in the latter. Control of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia in both countries is poor and should be improved.","title":"Awareness and control of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia in France and Northern Ireland.","pubmedId":"9205669"}
