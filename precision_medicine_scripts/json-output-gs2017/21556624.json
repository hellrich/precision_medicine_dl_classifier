Amplification of c-erbB2/neu, c-myc, N-ras, int-2, hst, PRAD-1 and EGFR genes was studied by slot blot and in situ hybridizations. p53 alterations were found in 31% cases by SSCP and 42% by IH; gene amplification was detected in 27% cases. p53 gene alterations correlated significantly with gene amplification (p\u003d0.006) and also with higher S-phase index (p\u003d0.026), aneuploidy (p\u003d0.026) and negative progesterone receptor status (p\u003d0.043).","title":"P53 alterations show significant correlation with gene amplification and s-phase index in breast-cancer.","pubmedId":"21556624"}
