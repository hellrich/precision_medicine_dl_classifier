Increased understanding of cancer biology has led to the identification of several potential targets for treatment. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to a family of plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases that controls many important cellular functions, from growth and proliferation to cell death. This receptor is a particularly promising therapeutic target because it often is overexpressed in patients with NSCLC and has been implicated in the pathogenesis as well as the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of lung cancer and other malignancies. New agents developed to inhibit EGFR function include small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies to EGFR, and pan-EGFR inhibitors. Completed and ongoing clinical trials have shown that EGFR inhibitors have remarkable efficacy for patients with relapsed NSCLC. Among these, two phase 2 trials have shown that ZD1839 is effective when used as monotherapy. The response rates are comparable with those for docetaxel given in the second-line setting. Another phase 2 trial has shown that OSI-774 is effective in the same setting. Data from phase 3 trials indicate that adding an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor to chemotherapy does not provide an additional survival benefit, as compared with standard chemotherapy alone for first-line treatment of NSCLC. It appears that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are safe and well tolerated by patients with cancer. Further studies will elucidate how these new agents can best be used for NSCLC and other tumor types.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors: application in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"15025409"}
