Patients with treatment-refractory MBC may benefit from tumor genomic evaluation using next generation sequencing (NGS). Furthermore, analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with advanced disease offers the possibility of non-invasive molecular monitoring.Methods: A patient with MBC was tested at each progression with a ctDNA NGS panel (Guardant360) that includes all NCCN-recommended somatic genomic variants for solid tumors and sequences complete exons of \u003e50 genes to report single nucleotide variants (SNVs), fusions, amplifications, and indels with high sensitivity and ultra-high specificity (\u003e99.9999%). The patient was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at age 44 and treated with surgery and hormonal therapy. At age 61, she had axillary adenopathy and liver metastases. Treatment details are in Table 1.Results: ctDNA analysis was performed at the time of metastatic diagnosis and at 5 additional time points over the course of treatment. All samples revealed an ERBB2 exon 19 indel (p.Leu755_Glu757delinsSer), and multiple SNVs and gene amplifications. ERBB2 amplification was seen in 4 of 6 samples. Mutant allele fractions (Table 1) correlated with clinical response to treatment and progression.Conclusions: Analysis of ctDNA in this patient identified an ERBB2 exon 19 indel, which are present in 2-4% of non-small cell lung cancers but 1-2% in breast cancer. Treatment with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody or dual anti-EGFR/ERBB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies may show clinical benefit. ctDNA analysis can detect emergence of actionable resistance mutations with the advantage of serial evaluation, allowing capture of inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity and illustration of molecular progression and response.","title":"Managing metastatic breast cancer via serial monitoring with circulating cell-free tumor DNA next generation sequencing testing","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-172"}
