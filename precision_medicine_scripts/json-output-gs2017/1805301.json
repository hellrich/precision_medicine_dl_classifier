CCK is also trophic to normal pancreas and pancreatic cancer; however, the cellular mechanisms which regulate CCK-stimulated growth are unknown. The effect of CCK on intracellular calcium was evaluated in four human pancreatic cancer cell lines known to grow in response to CCK but not secrete enzymes (SW-1990, MIA PaCa-2, BXPC-3 and PANC-1) and a rat acinar cell line (AR42J) shown to secrete enzymes but not grow with CCK. By using single cell fluorescence microscopy in fura-2 loaded cells, intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i was measured. After obtaining baseline fluorescent cell images, synthetic CCK-octapeptide (CCK8) was added to the cells and images of cell fluorescence captured. [Ca2+]i of the rat acinar cells increased (603%) over the baseline within the first minute after the addition of CCK (4.10(-13) M to 4.10(-10) M) in 77% of cells tested. In contrast [Ca2+]i failed to significantly change in the human cancer cells treated with CCK. To further localize the defect in hormone signal transduction in cancer cells, cells were suspended in low calcium media and the plasma membranes were selectively permeabilized with digitonin. Media free calcium concentration was continuously monitored by fura-2 fluorescence. Addition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) resulted in a marked increase in medium calcium concentration indicating IP3 was capable of releasing calcium from intracellular stores in both the AR42J rat acinar cell line and in the human pancreas cancer cell lines. In conclusion, CCK does not increase cytosolic calcium in human pancreatic cancer cells in contrast to rat acinar cells although all contain IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pools. Our results suggest that growth promoting and secretory effects of CCK on pancreatic cells may occur via two independent signalling pathways.","title":"Effects of cholecystokinin on cytosolic calcium in human pancreatic cancer cells.","pubmedId":"1805301"}
