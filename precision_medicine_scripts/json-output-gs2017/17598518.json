The development of laparovaginal surgery, indication and contraindication were presented. Also, the surgical technique was described in detail. Fifty-two patients were followed up in 2003 after LAVRH or open surgery, performed in our single center. Only 5 (14%) patients died from cervical cancer within 3 years following the treatment. They were all clinical stage IB treated with open surgery. There were 4 (11%) complications following treatment and they were all in patients with clinical stage IB, also treated with open surgery. There was no complication in LAVRH treated patients. The results and complications of the sole Croatian center performing LAVRH or open surgery in patients with cervical cancer FIGO stages IA and IB were similar to those in centers across the world.","title":"Laporovaginal surgery in cervical cancer: a Croatian experience.","pubmedId":"17598518"}
