Prognosis was compared with 219 curatively resected conventional PDAC.\nEleven MI-IPMCs (18.6%), 24 IPMC-Is (40.7%), and 24PDAC-IPMNs (40.7%) were identified. With the transition from MIIPMC to IPMC-I and PDAC-IPMN, percentage of advanced T (P G0.001) or N stage (P \u003d 0.001), expression of S100A4 (P \u003d 0.004), p53(P \u003d 0.028), and CD24 (P \u003d 0.009) increased; and SMAD4 expression decreased (P G 0.001). The overall 5-year survival rates for MIIPMC,IPMC-I, and PDAC-IPMN were 80.8%, 59.0%, and 29.3%,respectively (P G 0.001). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-associated IPMN had poor prognosis compared with MI-IPMC (P \u003d 0.011) or IPMC-I (P \u003d 0.026) but had comparable prognosis with conventional PDAC (P \u003d 0.138).\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-associated IPMN has different clinicopathological characteristics compared with the IPMC-I.Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with an associated invasive carcinoma is composed of a wide spectrum of disease.","title":"Disease spectrum of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with an associated invasive carcinoma invasive IPMN versus pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-associated IPMN.","pubmedId":"24308063"}
