Recently, increasing evidences indicate that BRAF((V600E)) mutation is a specific molecular feature and driver of the serrated pathway, and proximal serrated polyps with BRAF((V600E)) mutation have a high risk of progression to malignancy. We proposed that immunohistochemical detection of BRAF((V600E)) using a BRAF((V600E)) mutation-specific antibody is a feasible technique for reproducibly identifying proximal serrated polyps with malignant potential in clinical practice, which may need more aggressive treatment and vigilant clinical monitoring.
