These mutations and genomic aberrations are the basis for precision cancer medicine. Thus, rapid molecular characterization of clinical cancer samples has become increasingly important for cancer targeted therapy development. Our study addresses this need by identifying druggable gene amplifications in colorectal cancer (CRC). Along these lines, we developed an accurate and rapid droplet-digital PCR (ddPCR) assay to analyze cancer-specific copy number variations (CNV) in 13 genes with oncogenic function that are the targets of specific cancer therapies. These genes were selected based on the availability of approved and early-phase targeted therapeutics that inhibit their oncogenic function. Using TCGA data, we vetted our targets by identifying frequent CRC amplifications and a correlation with gene expression.The ddPCR method involves emulsifying matched-normal cancer sample DNA that provides specific advantages for highly sensitive and specific detection of cancer CNVs. Post-amplification, emulsion droplets are streamed single-file into a capillary that leads past a two-color detector, where the positive droplets for the target and reference genes are counted for quantitation. This technology requires nanogram amounts of genomic DNA, thus facilitating the study of clinical cancer samples from small biopsies. It works well with genomic DNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated high sensitivity for detecting copy number amplifications even in samples containing a prominent fraction of normal tissue.We are extending our analysis to the full 13 druggable gene targets and evaluating patterns of mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence among a cohort of over 200 CRC tumors with information on clinical outcome. For example, we have demonstrated FGFR1 amplifications in 5.2% of our CRC tumor population. For ERBB2 variations in the same cohort, we detected amplifications in 3.6% of our population. ERBB2 and FGFR1 amplification events displayed a mutually exclusive pattern of segregation (p value \u003c0.0001 per Chi-squared test with Yates correction). This efficient and inexpensive assay offers a significant potential to extend personalized therapeutic options available to CRC patients.","title":"Surveying colorectal cancer genome for clinically actionable genomic amplifications with droplet digital PCR.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-3488"}
