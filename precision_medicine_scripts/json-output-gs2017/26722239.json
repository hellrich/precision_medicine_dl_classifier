Although cases of extracranial metastatic meningioma have previously been reported, multiple pulmonary metastases from a benign intracranial meningioma is particularly rare. In the present report, a case of recurrent transitional meningioma with multiple lung nodules, which were demonstrated to be metastatic meningioma, is presented. A 54-year-old female patient received surgical resection of the tumor located in the left base of the middle cranial fossa in 2006. Post-surgery pathological examination indicated a transitional meningioma of World Health Organization grade I. The tumor recurred at the original site 1 year and 3 months later and was completely surgically removed once again. Radiotherapy was administered following the second surgery. Gamma Knife was used to remove the recurrent tumor 18 months following the second surgery. Simultaneously, a chest computed tomography scan revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, which were demonstrated to be metastatic meningioma following wedge resection of the superior lobe of the right lung. The clinical behavior of meningioma does not always correlate with the classification of meningioma. A higher rate of cellular proliferation is not essential for extracranial metastasis, and an individual meningioma of any type may metastasize. Comprehensive examinations should be performed for patients with a history of recurrent intracranial meningioma to detect any distant metastases as early as possible, even when the primary tumor is benign.","title":"Recurrent intracranial meningioma with multiple pulmonary metastases: A case report.","pubmedId":"26722239"}
