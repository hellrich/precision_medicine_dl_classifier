The effect of adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy on survival and loco-regional control is not yet established in this malignancy.\nFrom January 1989 to December 2000, 113 patients underwent pancreatico-duodenectomy for ampullary cancer. One hundred and four patients who survived the operation were available for analysis to study the effect of adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy on survival and loco-regional control. Forty-nine patients received adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (median dose 50.4 Gy with concurrent 5-Flurouracil) and long-term outcome in these patients was compared with those 55 who did not receive adjuvant therapy.\nThe overall median survival was 30.1 (range 1.6-140.0) months with actuarial 1, 3 and 5-year survival rates of 79, 43 and 33%, respectively. No significant difference in median survival (34.6 vs 24.5 months; P\u003d0.3) and actuarial 5-year survival rates (38 vs 28%) was seen between those who received and those who did not receive adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy did not influence the survival in high-risk patients (P\u003d0.84), in various T and N stages and had no impact on loco-regional recurrence (P\u003d0.6).\nAdjuvant chemo-radiotherapy did not improve the long-term survival or decrease recurrence rates in patients with ampullary cancers who had undergone pancreatico-duodenectomy.","title":"Adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy in ampullary cancers.","pubmedId":"15698732"}
