In this study, we analyzed PBK/TOPK expression in hepatic primary tumor and explored its role in cholangiocarcinoma biology. Seventy-four cholangiocarcinomas, 33 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 10 normal liver tissues were prepared from paraffin-embedded specimens. PBK/TOPK protein was assessed by immunohistochemical staining, and the survival time was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method. The protein, mRNA of PBK/TOPK, and cell cycle of cholangiocarcinoma cell line after PBK/TOPK suppression with small interfere RNA were studied by Western blot, semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry, respectively. PBK/TOPK was usually expressed in normal bile duct epithelial cells and much more frequently expressed in cholangiocarcinoma (68/74) but never expressed in hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinomas (0/33). PBK/TOPK down-regulation was related to the poor prognosis of patients with cholangiocarcinoma (P \u003d .013). Epidermal growth factor can enhance PBK/TOPK expression in cholangiocarcinoma QBC 939 cells, but suppression of PBK/TOPK in the cells did not affect their proliferation. PBK/TOPK protein could serve as a useful indicator for histopathologic differentiation between cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinomas and the low expression of PBK/TOPK is predicative of poor survival in cholangiocarcinoma patients.","title":"PBK/TOPK in the differential diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and its involvement in prognosis of human cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19954816"}
