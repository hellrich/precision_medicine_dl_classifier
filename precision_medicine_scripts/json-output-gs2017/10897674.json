To overcome this problem, we investigated the characterization of plasma DNA and it application to successfully detecting K-ras mutation at codon 12 in normal persons, hematopoietic neoplasms, and solid tumors. The range of plasma DNA in each group was 15.8 +/- 5.2 ng/ml, 43.3 +/- 29.8 ng/ml, and 26.8 +/- 17.0 ng/ml, respectively. The ranges in patients with solid tumor were gradually decreased to the normal level of around 15 ng/ml in 3 weeks postoperatively. Plasma DNAs consisted of about 200 bp DNA fragmentation and were convenient for PCR amplification of K-ras gene. The mutation at codon 12 by PCR-RFLP analysis was detected in 13(27%) of 49 patients with solid tumors such as pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and gastric cancer. The diagnostic specificity was 100%. Serial observations by the PCR-RFLP analysis revealed disappearance of the mutant K-ras about 7 days after successful curative surgery in a patient with gastric cancer.","title":"[Characteristics of plasma DNA and its application for detection of K-ras gene mutation].","pubmedId":"10897674"}
