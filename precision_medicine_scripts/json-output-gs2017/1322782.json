Point mutational activation of ras oncogenes has been observed in several populations. The incidence of these mutations in Hong Kong lung carcinomas was investigated.\nLung resections obtained from 52 Chinese patients whose conditions were newly diagnosed as non-small cell lung cancer, paraffin sections from 29 Chinese patients with previously diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the lung, and paraffin sections from 49 squamous cell carcinomas were examined for the presence of point mutations in Ki-ras codon 12, N-ras codon 61, and Ha-ras codon 12 oncogenes by allele-specific hybridization after specific amplification of appropriate regions of the DNA using the polymerase chain reaction.\nAmong the 130 lung carcinomas investigated, Ki-ras point mutations were detected in seven cases, of which six were adenocarcinomas and one a squamous cell carcinoma. No mutations were detected in the N-ras and Ha-ras codons.\nThe incidence of Ki-ras codon 12 point mutational activation in Chinese patients with adenocarcinomas was 6 of 63 (9.5%). The incidence of Ki-ras 12 point mutational activation among men with lung adenocarcinomas in Hong Kong (6 of 32 patients, 18.8%) is significantly different from that in women in Hong Kong (0 of 31 patients, 0%). Although ras oncogenes are implicated as having a role in the development of lung adenocarcinomas, especially among smokers, it is clear from these data that they are not associated with the unusually high incidence of lung adenocarcinomas among women in Hong Kong.","title":"Incidence of ras oncogene activation in lung carcinomas in Hong Kong.","pubmedId":"1322782"}
