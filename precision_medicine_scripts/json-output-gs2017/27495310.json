Molecular screening of these two genes in patients with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer has revealed pathogenic variants as well as genetic variants of unknown significance (VUS). These VUS may cause a challenge in the genetic counseling process regarding clinical management of the patient and the family. We investigated 32 variants previously detected in 33 samples from patients with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. cDNA was analyzed for alternative transcripts and selected missense variants located in the BRCT domains of BRCA1 were assessed for their trans-activation ability. Although an extensive cDNA analysis was done, only three of the 32 variants appeared to affect the splice-process (BRCA1 c.213-5T\u003eA, BRCA1 c.5434C\u003eG and BRCA2 c.68-7T\u003eA). In addition, two variants located in the BRCT domains of BRCA1 (c.5075A\u003eC p.Asp1692Ala and c.5513T\u003eG p.Val1838Gly) were shown to abolish the BRCT domain trans-activation ability, whereas BRCA1 c.5125G\u003eA p.Gly1709Arg exhibited equal trans-activation capability as the WT domain. These functional studies may offer further insights into the pathogenicity of certain identified variants; however, this assay is only applicable for a subset of missense variants.","title":"Characterization of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants found in a Norwegian breast or ovarian cancer cohort.","pubmedId":"27495310"}
