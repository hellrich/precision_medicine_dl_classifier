In each case, a tumor differentiation was noted after induction chemotherapy, which otherwise determined in both patient a dramatic tumor response. This may be explained by heterogenicity of the primary tumors, which may include several cell contingents with different responses to chemotherapy. This constitutes a potential impediment to the efficacy of induction or adjuvant chemotherapy.","title":"Liposarcoma: patterns of tumor differentiation following induction chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"6427719"}
