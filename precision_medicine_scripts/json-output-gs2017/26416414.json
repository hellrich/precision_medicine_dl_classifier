{"keywords":["GIST","exon 11","imatinib","second line","sunitinib"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"We retrospectively reviewed data from 123 patients (KIT exon 11 mutated) who received sunitinib or dose-escalated imatinib as second line.All patients progressed on imatinib (400 mg/die) and received a second line treatment with imatinib (800 mg/die) or sunitinib (50 mg/die 4 weeks on/2 off or 37.5 mg/day). Deletion versus other KIT 11 mutation was recorded, correlated with clinical benefits.64% received imatinib, 36% sunitinib. KIT exon 11 mutation was available in 94 patients. With a median follow-up of 61 months, median time to progression (TTP) in patients receiving sunitinib and imatinib was 10 (95% CI 9.7-10.9) and 5 months (95% CI 3.6-6.7) respectively (P \u003d 0.012). No difference was found in overall survival (OS) (P \u003d 0.883). In imatinib arm, KIT exon 11 deletions was associated with a shorter TTP (7 vs 17 months; P \u003d 0.02), with a trend in OS (54 vs 71 months P \u003d 0.063). No difference was found in patients treated with sunitinib (P \u003d 0.370).A second line with sunitinib was associated with an improved TTP in KIT exon 11 mutated patients progressing on imatinib 400 mg/die. Deletions in exon 11 seemed to be correlated with worse outcome in patients receiving imatinib-based second line.","title":"Imatinib dose escalation versus sunitinib as a second line treatment in KIT exon 11 mutated GIST: a retrospective analysis.","pubmedId":"26416414"}
