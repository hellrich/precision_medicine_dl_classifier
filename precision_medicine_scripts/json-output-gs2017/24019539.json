Association of biomarkers with disease-free survival (DFS) was determined using Cox models. A validation cohort (Cancer and Leukemia Group B 88903 trial) was used.\ndMMR was detected in 314 (12%) of 2,580 tumors, of which 49.3% and 10.6% had BRAF(V600E) or KRAS mutations, respectively. MMR status was not prognostic overall (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.07; P \u003d .14), yet significant interactions were found between MMR and primary tumor site (P(interaction) \u003d .009) and lymph node category (N1 v N2; P(interaction) \u003d .014). Favorable DFS was observed for dMMR versus proficient MMR proximal tumors (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94; P \u003d .018) but not dMMR distal tumors (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.95; P \u003d .056), adjusting for mutations and covariates. Any survival benefit of dMMR was lost in N2 tumors. Mutations in BRAF(V600E) (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.70; P \u003d .009) or KRAS (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.70; P \u003c .001) were independently associated with worse DFS. The observed MMR by tumor site interaction was validated in an independent cohort of stage III colon cancers (P(interaction) \u003d .037).\nThe prognostic impact of MMR depended on tumor site, and this interaction was validated in an independent cohort. Among dMMR cancers, proximal tumors had favorable outcome, whereas distal or N2 tumors had poor outcome. BRAF or KRAS mutations were independently associated with adverse outcome.","title":"Prognostic impact of deficient DNA mismatch repair in patients with stage III colon cancer from a randomized trial of FOLFOX-based adjuvant chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"24019539"}
