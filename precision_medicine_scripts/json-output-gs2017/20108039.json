Nevertheless, the natural history of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors has not been fully elucidated.\nTo determine the long-term clinical outcome of nonresected gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors.\nClinical follow-up of patients with endosonographic characteristics compatible with gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors was conducted based on Israeli population registry. Lesions with features suggesting malignancy were usually referred to surgery. Follow-up endoscopic ultrasound examinations of nonoperated patients were reviewed.\nSeventy-one patients with presumable gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors were followed. Seventeen patients underwent operation; median tumor size was 43 mm (range 29-70 mm). Within a median of 43 months (range 2-131 months) ten patients died of causes unrelated to gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Forty-four patients with endosonographic diagnosis of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors were followed expectantly for a median of 12 years (range 5-15 years). All these patients are alive and without complications associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Follow-up endoscopic ultrasound examinations demonstrated no change in tumor size in six, decrease (by 1-5 mm) in six, and increase (by 2-21 mm) in eight.\nTherapeutic decisions guiding surgical interventions may be based on clinical presentation, comorbidity, and endosonographic characteristics. Nonoperated patients may be safely followed conservatively.","title":"Long-term clinical outcome of patients with gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"20108039"}
