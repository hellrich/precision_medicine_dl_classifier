Although the microscopic features have been known for a long time, the defining characteristic of GIST is the presence of the cell-surface antigen CD117 (KIT), which is demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. KIT, which is a growth factor transmembrane receptor, is the product of the proto-oncogene c-kit (chromosome 4). Surgical removal remains the only curative treatment for patients with GISTs. Tumor size, mitotic index, anatomic location, tumor rupture and disease-free interval are the classic characteristics used to predict the clinical course of patients who undergo complete gross resection. Most GISTs express constitutively activated mutant isoforms of KIT or kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) that are potential therapeutic targets for imatinib mesylate. Imatinib mesylate is a rationally designed, molecularly specific oral anticancer agent that selectively inhibits several protein tyrosine kinases central to the pathogenesis of human cancer and which has demonstrated remarkable clinical efficacy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and malignant GISTs. More recently Sunitinib, a new KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitor, has been tested in patients with GIST resistant to imatinib, with promising results.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs): focus on histopathological diagnosis and biomolecular features.","pubmedId":"17591808"}
