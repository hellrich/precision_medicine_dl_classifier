Methods: This is a single-center open-label single arm two-stage phase II study. The primary objective was response rate (RR). Secondary objectives included overall progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Eligibility included: KRAS exon 2 wild-type, ECOG PS 0-1, metastatic disease, adequate organ function and prior progression or intolerance to fluoropyrimidine with oxaliplatin. Panitumumab was administered at a dose of 6mg/kg IV every 14 days. Next generation sequencing panels were used for genomic analysis. Results: 9 patients [M/F 7/2, median age: 61 yrs (range: 40-74), ECOG PS 0/1: 2/7] were enrolled from September 2013 to October 2015. 1 pt had AAC (pancreaticobiliary subtype) and 8 pts had SBA (duodenal in 3, jejunal/ileal in 5). The most common toxicity was grade 1 acneiform rash in all patients. The most common grade 2/3 toxicities were anemia (33%), fatigue (22%), hypomagnesemia (22%) and skin infection (22%). None of the patients had a response, 2 patients had SD while the remaining 7 patients had PD. At a median follow-up time of 16.6 months, the median PFS and median OS were 2.4 months and 5.6 months, respectively. Extended RAS mutational testing identified 0/9 patients with mutations in extended KRAS or NRAS. Further genomic analysis of genes relevant to anti-EGFR activity (BRAF, PIK3CA and ERBB2) identified 2/9 patients with BRAF G469A mutation, 1/9 patients with PIK3CA H1047R mutation, and 0/9 patients with ERRB2 mutations. Conclusions: Although well tolerated, panitumumab had minimal clinical activity in patients with metastatic SBA and AAC. Given recent findings suggesting that right-sided colon cancers (hindgut derivation) benefit less from anti-EGFR therapy compared to left-sided colon cancers (midgut derivation), we propose that our findings may relate to the primarily foregut (proximal duodenum) and midgut (distal duodenum to ileum) derivation of the small bowel.
