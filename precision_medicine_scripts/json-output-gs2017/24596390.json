Enzymatic activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1), a de-toxifying enzyme that oxidizes intracellular aldehydes, has been used as a marker of normal and malignant breast stem cells (BSCs). CD44-transmembrane protein has already been shown to possess the ability to identify breast epithelial cells with stem properties.\nIn order to compare two of the currently most reliable BSCs markers, ALDH1 and CD44, and to correlate their expression within different breast lesions, 190 samples from breast cancer specimens were analyzed by tissue microarrays.\nALDH1 expression was observed in 85.43% and CD44 in 90.3% of all samples. No overexpression was observed for ALDH1 between invasive tumors, ductal carcinomas in situ and non-malignant lesions of breast, although ALDH1 had a significant negative correlation with estrogen-receptor (ER) and progesterone-receptor (PR) status (p\u003d0.002 and p\u003d0.001, respectively) and a positive correlation with CD44 (p\u003c0.001). Moreover, combined overexpression of ALDH1 and CD44 was observed in ductal in situ tumors (p\u003c0.001).\nThe combined overexpression of these markers in ductal carcinomas in situ is in agreement with the CSC model in breast cancer.","title":"Co-expression of stem cell markers ALDH1 and CD44 in non-malignant and neoplastic lesions of the breast.","pubmedId":"24596390"}
