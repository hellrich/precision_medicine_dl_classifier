Combination regimens using infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV) plus either oxaliplatin or irinotecan have demonstrated clinically meaningful, high efficacy in advanced CRC. Based on the results of the Intergroup trial N9741, FOLFOX4, a combination of infusional plus bolus 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin, has emerged as the standard first-line therapy in the palliative setting. However, infusional 5-FU-based regimens carry the need for use of central venous lines and implantable ports to allow treatment on an outpatient basis and are thus inconvenient and expensive. The use of oral fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine or uracil/tegafur [UFT] plus LV) as substitutes for infusional 5-FU in combination protocols with oxaliplatin offers greater convenience, at the same time conceivably maintaining the high efficacy and tolerability observed with intravenous protocols. Various phase I/II trials have recently been reported that investigated oxaliplatin in combination with either capecitabine or UFT/LV in patients with advanced CRC. This review will detail the results of these trials focused on capecitabine-based combinations.","title":"Oxaliplatin plus oral fluoropyrimidines in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"15212704"}
