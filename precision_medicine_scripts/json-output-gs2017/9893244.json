The persistence and volume of bile leak resulted in subsequent investigation of the biliary tree which demonstrated a cholangiocarcinoma of the right hepatic duct. This case is presented as an unusual presentation of cholangiocarcinoma and to highlight the value of modern techniques in imaging the biliary tree.","title":"Leakage via aberrant bile duct due to cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"9893244"}
