The association of uveal melanoma with breast and ovarian cancer and the increased risk in BRCA2-linked families implicates germline BRCA2 mutations as the cause of a subset of uveal melanomas. Similarly, the association between cutaneous and uveal melanomas in some families, coupled with the high frequency of somatic deletions of the INK4A-ARF locus in uveal melanomas, strongly suggests that mutations in P16(INK4A) and P15 account for a proportion of uveal melanomas.\nTo examine this proposition, a systematically ascertained series of 385 patients with uveal melanoma were screened for germline mutations in BRCA2, P16(INK4A), P14(ARF), and P15.\nOne patient was found to harbor a Gly35Ala substitution in exon 1alpha of P16(INK4A), which has previously been reported to be pathogenic. No mutations were detected in P14(ARF) or P15. None of the patients harbored germline nucleotide changes that lead to truncation or that create or disrupt consensus splice sites of BRCA2 or missense variants with clear pathogenic potential.\nThese findings suggest that less than 2% of cases of uveal melanoma can be ascribed to germline mutations in BRCA2, P16(INK4A), P14(ARF), or P15. It is likely that mutations in other genes contribute to an inherited predisposition to uveal melanoma.","title":"Contribution of germline mutations in BRCA2, P16(INK4A), P14(ARF) and P15 to uveal melanoma.","pubmedId":"12556369"}
