Complete resection with negative histologic margins is the most effective treatment modality.\nHowever, the majority of patients are not candidates for surgery.                                                                        Over the last decades, advances have evolved to improve resectability and morbidity after major liver and bile duct resection. However, these disease processes still pose a management challenge. Herein, we provide an overview of proximal bile duct cancers, hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCa) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICCa).","title":"Surgical management of proximal bile duct cancers.","pubmedId":"22391776"}
