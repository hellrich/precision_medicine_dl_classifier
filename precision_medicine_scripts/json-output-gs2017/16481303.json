We present a case of a metastatic duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor that was successfully treated by simultaneous right hemihepatectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nA 50-year-old woman was admitted to our department for the treatment of a possible metastatic duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). At laparotomy a large duodenal tumor was found displacing the head of the pancreas. A 3 cm in diameter lesion in the posterior aspect of segment VIII of the liver was also noted. Simultaneous right hepatectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy were performed.\nHistological examination revealed a high grade metastatic duodenal GIST strongly positive for c-kit, CD34, and vimentin. The patient had no additional therapy. A follow-up of 21 months showed that the patient is very well and there is no evidence of recurrent diseases.\nMalignant stromal tumors of the duodenum are rarely encountered. They are usually slow growing, and may be amenable to curative surgery, even after occurrence of metastases. Resection of localized liver metastasis is still advocated when feasible, since imatinib does not provide a complete or long-term response. Combined surgical resection is an efficacious treatment for patients with metastatic duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","title":"Hepatopancreatoduodenectomy for metastatic duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","pubmedId":"16481303"}
