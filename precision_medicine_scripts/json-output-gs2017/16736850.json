Extremities and retroperitoneum are the most common sites. Intraabdominal and particulary mesocolic liposarcoma is a rare localisation. We report the case of a 64-year-old woman with a localized grade 1 liposarcoma of the right mesocolon treated by an extended right hemicolectomy. No further treatment was done because of the low grading and the disease-free margins. The patient is without any evidence of recurrence after one year.","title":"[Mesocolon liposarcoma: a case report].","pubmedId":"16736850"}
