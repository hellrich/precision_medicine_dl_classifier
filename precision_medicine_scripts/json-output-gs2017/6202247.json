Since Huggins demonstrated the dramatic effect of antiandrogenic treatment, patients with prostate cancer are widely treated by bilateral orchiectomy and high dose estrogen. As the incidence of cardiovascular disease has also gradually increased in patients of prostate cancer treated by estrogen in Japan, radiotherapy, radical prostatectomy, antiandrogen such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate and anticancer chemotherapy are now sought and tested clinically. The authors have emphasized multidisciplinary treatment according to the stage of prostate cancer. In particular, early prostate cancer without metastasis should be radically treated with radiotherapy or prostatectomy.","title":"[Prostate cancer].","pubmedId":"6202247"}
