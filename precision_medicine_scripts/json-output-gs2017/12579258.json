To evaluate the clinical usefulness of these markers, we performed comparative analysis in 61 resected pancreatic samples including 15 intraductal papillary-mucinous tumours (IPMTs), 4 mucinous cystic tumours, 37 ductal adenocarcinomas, and five chronic pancreatitis samples. K-ras point mutation, telomerase activity, and p53 overexpression were analyzed using mutant allele specific amplification, the telomeric repeat amplification protocol, and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. In malignant tumours, K-ras mutation, telomerase activity, and p53 overexpression were detectable in 76, 91, and 46%, respectively, while in benign tumours, these alterations were detectable in 38, 0, and 0%, respectively. Among 15 IPMTs, K-ras mutation was detectable in 4 (80%) of 5 IPMT-adenomas, 4 (80%) of 5 IPMT-carcinomas and 2 (66%) of 3 papillary-mucinous carcinomas, which are invasive carcinomas derived from IPMTs. Telomerase activity was not detectable in IPMT-adenomas, but was detected in all 5 IPMT-carcinomas and 3 papillary-mucinous carcinomas. p53 overexpression was not detected in IPMTs, but was detected in 2 (66%) of 3 papillary-mucinous carcinomas, indicating that telomerase is likely to be activated concomitant with carcinogenesis. These results suggest that telomerase activity is the most useful as a differential diagnostic marker between malignant and benign pancreatic tumours.","title":"Comparative analysis of K-ras point mutation, telomerase activity, and p53 overexpression in pancreatic tumours.","pubmedId":"12579258"}
