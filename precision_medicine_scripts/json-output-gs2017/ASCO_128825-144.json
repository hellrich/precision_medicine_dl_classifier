Prognosis is poor with few treatment options. Amplified FGFR1 is one of the most common oncogenic events in SQCLCs and occurs in ~20% of cases. AZD4547 is a potent and selective FGFR1-3 inhibitor with activity in FGFR1 amplified SQCLC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Prior work identified a recommended dose of 80mg po bid.  Methods:    This was a multicentre Phase 1 expansion of AZD4547 in patients with previously treated stage IV FGFR1 amplified SQCLCs (NCT00979134).  FGFR1 amplification (FGFR1:CEP8 2) was confirmed through central FISH (N\u003d13) or review of local results (N\u003d2). Primary endpoint was safety/tolerability.  Secondary endpoints were preliminary anti-tumor activity, PK, and PD. CT scans were performed at baseline and every 6 weeks.   Results:  15 patients were treated. Median age\u003d66 (48-72); female\u003d46%; former/current smoker\u003d100%; WHO restricted PS\u003d69%. 8 patients had FISH ratios between 2-2.8 (low amplification).  7 patients had FISH ratios \u003e 2.8 (high amplification).  Mean relative dose intensity\u003d 97%.  The most common related AEs were GI and dermatologic. Grade  3 related AEs occurred in 3 patients (20%) (central serous retinopathy (CSR), hyponatremia, dehydration).  Related SAEs occurred in 3 patients (CSR,dehydration, asthenia and dyspnea). There were 3 discontinuations due to AEs and no deaths due to drug. 14 patients were evaluable for tumor response assessment.  There were: 1 PR, 4 SD, 9 PD (7 progressions and 2 deaths). The 1 PR was observed in a patient with high FGFR1amplification.  Preliminary analysis found an increase in serum phosphate following treatment with AZD4547.  Exon-sequencing of 283 cancer-related genes in 6 patient tumors, including 1 with a PR, showed no clear response modifiers.   Conclusions:  AZD4547 was well-tolerated in patients with FGFR1 amplified SQCLC but did not meet its pre-specified efficacy endpoint in terms of overall response rate for continuation. The increase in serum phosphate concentration observed in this study provides evidence that AZD4547 at this dose and schedule causes pharmacologic target inhibition.
