It is necessary for elderly patients who are under-represented in clinical trials to study their suitable regimen. Thus, phase II and III clinical trials have been performed specifically for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients all over the world. As for single agent chemotherapy, there is a strong rationale for docetaxel and vinorelbine in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. Recently, there are phase I and II clinical trial for CPT-11 monotherapy, and gefitinib and TS-1 are reasonable options for elderly patients. Alimta is tolerable for elderly, and subset analysis is performed for the elderly with recurrent NSCLC. As platinum-based chemotherapy, there are several elderly subset analyses and JCOG 0207, which is a phase III trial now in progress comparing weekly cisplatin+weekly docetaxel and weekly docetaxel. In SCLC, there is no evidence of single agent chemotherapy but combination chemotherapy such as carboplatin+etoposide is recommended. A phase III study of carboplatin+etoposide versus amrubicin under way. These studies should aim to optimize several agents for elderly patients and prolong survival, palliative care.","title":"[Lung cancer].","pubmedId":"17353626"}
