The ampullary adenoma is also a rare neoplasm and has the potential to develop an adenocarcinoma. Their coexistence has been rarely reported in the literature. We herein describe an unusual case of a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma associated with a villous adenoma in the ampulla of Vater with emphasis on computed tomography (CT) and histopathological findings. We also discuss their clinical, histopathological and radiological features as well as possible histogenesis.","title":"Coexistence of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and villous adenoma in the ampulla of Vater.","pubmedId":"18698690"}
