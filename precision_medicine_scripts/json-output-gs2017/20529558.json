But the mechanism has not been clarified yet. There are few reports about the treatment of endometrial carcinoma using GnRH-I agonists. Type II GnRH (GnRH-II) is a new subtype of GnRH. Our aim was to investigate the effects of GnRH-I agonists and GnRH-II on estrogen receptor-negative human endometrial carcinoma cells and the effect from phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) to them.\nA lentiviral vector-mediated RNAi method was used to establish a PTEN-negative HEC-1A cell clone (HEC-1A-ND). MTT and flow cytometry were used to detect the cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of HEC-1A, HEC-1A-NC and HEC-1A-ND cells after treatment with GnRH-I agonist Triptorelin (10(-11) mol/L to 10(-5) mol/L) or GnRH-II (10(-11) mol/L to 10(-5) mol/L). Western blotting was used to detect AKT and ERK1/2 activation after treatment with different concentrations of Triptorelin or GnRH-II for 30 minutes in the above mentioned three kinds of cells.\nTriptorelin and GnRH-II induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HEC-1A, HEC-1A-ND and HEC-1A-NC in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was augmented in HEC-1A-ND cells in which PTEN gene was knocked-down. Furthermore, Triptorelin and GnRH-II inhibited the AKT and ERK activity in HEC-1A-ND cells.\nTriptorelin and GnRH-II can promote apoptosis rate and inhibit cell proliferation of estrogen receptor-negative endometrial carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. PTEN gene can inhibit the effects of Triptorelin or GnRH-II on human endometrial carcinoma cells.","title":"Phosphatase and tensin homolog gene inhibits the effect induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone subtypes in human endometrial carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"20529558"}
