Therefore risk of colon cancer is closely related to diet and other lifestyle factors. Dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin E, should reduce the levels of harmful oxidation products. However vitamin E is not soluble in water, which decreases its bioavailability. As O-glycosides of alpha-tocopherol are better soluble in water and penetrate to tissues easier than free alpha-tocopherol, the aim of our work was to investigate the rate of release the free tocopherol from its O-glycosides in colon cancer, in comparison to human healthy colon tissue.\nThe activities of enzymes catalysing hydrolysis of alpha-tocopheryl glucoside (1a) and mannoside (1b) as well as p-nitrophenyl beta-glucoside (2a) and mannoside (2b) in cancer and healthy human colon tissues, were determined according to the modified method described by Zwierz et al.\nThe alpha-tocopherol and p-nitrophenol were significantly better released from the respective glucosides and mannosides in cancer tissue than in \"healthy\" human colon tissues, with p \u003d 0.000947 for la, p \u003d 0.033024 for 1b; p \u003d 0.0028 for 2a, and p \u003d 0.0033 for 2b, respectively.\nAlpha-tocopherol and p-nitrophenol are released from the O-glycosides of glucose and mannose in significantly higher amount in colon cancer than in healthy tissues. The alpha-tocopherol O-glycosides can be considered as prodrugs in prevention and treatment of the colon cancer.","title":"Colon cancer releases alpha-tocopherol from its O-glycosides better than normal colon tissue.","pubmedId":"19579594"}
