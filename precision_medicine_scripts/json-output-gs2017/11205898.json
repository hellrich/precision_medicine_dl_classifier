Because the NF2 gene is not mutated in all meningiomas, additional genes may be involved. Instead of looking for alterations directly at the DNA level, we used the immune response of meningioma patients to identify immunogenic antigens that may be associated with the disease. We screened a fetal brain cDNA expression library with sera pools from different patients bearing meningioma classified according to the three WHO grades, using the serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning immunological screening method. Here, we report the finding of a new tankyrase-related protein. We found 16 overlapping clones with homologies to tankyrase when we screened the library with the common-type meningioma sera pool and 2 such clones when we screened the library with the atypical meningioma sera. The anaplastic meningioma sera did not identify any tankyrase-related clones. We tested some of the newly identified clones with 13 single sera, 6 of which (37.5%) reacted positively with the tankyrase-related clones. In addition, we screened the tankyrase-related clone with six sera pools from individuals without obvious disease. Although 1 of 24 (4.2%) normal sera reacted with the tankyrase-related clone, we found a striking difference in the frequency of reactivity to this clone by sera from patients bearing tumors corresponding to the three WHO meningioma grades; common-type sera was the most frequently reactive. Northern blot analysis demonstrates expression of the novel tankyrase gene in two common-type meningiomas from patients with immune response.","title":"Novel tankyrase-related gene detected with meningioma-specific sera.","pubmedId":"11205898"}
