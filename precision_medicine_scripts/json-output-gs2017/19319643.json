We report a case of synchronous sporadic gastric and jejunal GISTs, which were resected laparoscopically in a 67-year-old man. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that both lesions were KIT (CD117)-positive, but that the gastric lesion was CD34-positive, whereas the jejunal one was Vimentin-, S-100-, and SMA-positive. Molecular analysis of mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17, and in PDGFRA exons 12 and 18 revealed the presence of a gastric sporadic GIST with a KIT mutation of the exon 11 and a jejunal sporadic GIST without KIT or PDGFRA mutations. To our knowledge, this is the first report of laparoscopically resected synchronous sporadic gastric and jejunal GISTs.","title":"Laparoscopic resection of sporadic synchronous gastric and jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumors: report of a case.","pubmedId":"19319643"}
