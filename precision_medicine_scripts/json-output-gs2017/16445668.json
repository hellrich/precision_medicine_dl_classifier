The HER-2 oncogene, located on chromosome 17, encodes for a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor. We analyzed HER-2/neu overexpression by immunohistochemistry in 28 uterine carcinosarcomas. HER-2/neu amplification with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was tested in positive cases. The expression of HER-2/neu was correlated with disease-free interval and survival (Kaplan-Meier estimates). We observed HER-2/neu overexpression in nine cases (32.1%) and HER-2/neu amplification in all the four HER-2/neu 3+ score positive cases tested by FISH. HER-2/neu expression was not correlated with clinical outcome. Patients with disease limited to the uterus (stages I-II) displayed a significantly better disease-free survival (P\u003d 0.004) and actuarial survival (P\u003d 0.01). Demonstration of HER-2/neu overexpression and amplification in uterine carcinosarcoma may represent the first rationale step for further investigations. Hence, the results of this analysis may support the challenge of a new therapeutic approach, which could test the role of anti-HER-2 (trastuzumab) in patients with advanced or metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma.","title":"Expression and amplification of HER-2/neu oncogene in uterine carcinosarcomas: a marker for potential molecularly targeted treatment?","pubmedId":"16445668"}
