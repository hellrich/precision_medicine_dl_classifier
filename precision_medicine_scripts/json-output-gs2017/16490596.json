CCND1 gene amplification (45%) was more prevalent than polysomy (25%) in esophageal carcinoma, but the pattern observed was similar in gastric adenocarcinoma (10% amplification, 15% polysomy). For ERBB2, polysomy was a more frequent mechanism than amplification in both esophageal (32.5 vs. 7.5%) and gastric (15 vs. 5%) cancers. Overexpression of cyclin D1 protein was identified in 37.5% of the specimens of esophageal tumors and 35% of gastric tumors, and overexpression of Her-2/neu protein in 12.5 and 7.5%, respectively. The kappa-statistics revealed a fair agreement in both types of tumors only in overexpression and amplification of the CCND1 gene; the ERBB2 gene showed a fair agreement in amplification and polysomy and the level of protein expression in gastric adenocarcinoma. Thus, polysomy 17 could contribute to a high Her-2/neu protein level, at least in gastric cancer. Our data indicated an association with alcohol consumption and the CCND1 gene or protein levels, in both esophageal and gastric cancers.","title":"Alterations of the CCND1 and HER-2/neu (ERBB2) proteins in esophageal and gastric cancers.","pubmedId":"16490596"}
