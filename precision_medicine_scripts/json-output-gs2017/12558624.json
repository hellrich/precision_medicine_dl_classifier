Early detection and improved treatment techniques have resulted in better control of cancer and longer survival, however, invasive and metastatic disease still occur. Cervical cancer usually spreads through direct local extension and via the lymphatics, haematogenous metastasis is relatively infrequent and cutaneous metastases are very rare. Metastasis to the scalp is extremely rare and only three cases of scalp metastasis from cervical cancer have been reported in the literature. We now report a patient with cervical cancer who presented with metastasis to this very unusual site.","title":"Cutaneous metastasis to the scalp from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.","pubmedId":"12558624"}
