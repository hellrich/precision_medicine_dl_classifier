Our patient is a 25 year old male who presented with symptomatic unilateral gynecomastia. He presented with a strong family history of cancer on both maternal and paternal sides of his family including breast, lung (maternal) and melanoma, colon and pancreatic (paternal). His mother tested negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2. There is no information on the paternal genetic testing. He was treated with left subcutaneous mastectomy. Upon histologic review of the sample, concurrent gyecomastia and ductal carcinoma in situ was discovered. To date, only four cases of gynecomastia and DCIS have been described in younger male patients. Since only 30 - 50% of patients with DCIS eventually develop invasive cancer in the subsequent 10 - 20 years, this figure in the general population may be higher. This case underscores the importance of family history in any patient presenting with a breast mass. Patients must be made aware of the risk, however small it may be and physicians must remain cautious of malignancy in young males with gynecomastia.","title":"Case report of a 27-year-old male with DCIS.","pubmedId":"ASCO_33607-65"}
