Among the 145 patients, the frequency of extra-pancreatic cancer was 29.0%. The frequency of gastric cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer were 25.5%, 15.7%, 13.7%, and 9.8%, respectively. Twenty (13.8%) of the patients died. The cause of death was extra-pancreatic carcinoma in 40%, pancreatic cancer in 25%, IPMN per se in 20%, and benign disease in 15% of the patients.\nThe prognosis for IPMN depends not on the IPMN per se, but on the presence of intra- or extra-pancreatic cancer.","title":"Prognosis of cancer with branch duct type IPMN of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"20397268"}
