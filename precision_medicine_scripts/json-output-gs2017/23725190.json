The aim of this paper was to make a systematic review of its prevalence and associated factors oin breast cancer survivors.\nAn extensive systematic electronic review (PUBMED, CINAHL, PsyINFO and Ovid) and handsearch were carried out to retrieve published articles up to November 2012, using Depression OR Dysthymia AND (Cancer OR Tumor OR Neoplasms as the keywords. Information about the design of the studies, measuring scale, characteristics of the participants, prevalence of depression and its associated factors from the included studies were extracted and summarized.\nWe identified 32 eligible studies that recruited 10,826 breast cancer survivors. Most were cross-sectional or prospective designed. The most frequent instrument used to screen depression was the Center for Epidemiological Studies for Depression (CES-D, n\u003d11 studies) followed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, n\u003d6 studies) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, n\u003d6 studies). CES-D returned about similar prevalence of depression (median\u003d22%, range\u003d13-56%) with BDI (median\u003d22%, range\u003d17-48%) but higher than HADS (median\u003d10%, range\u003d1-22%). Depression was associated with several socio-demographic variables, cancer-related factors, treatment-related factors, subject psychological factors, lifestyle factors, social support and quality of life.\nBreast cancer survivors are at risk for depression so that detection of associated factors is important in clinical practice.","title":"Prevalence of depression in breast cancer survivors: a systematic review of observational studies.","pubmedId":"23725190"}
