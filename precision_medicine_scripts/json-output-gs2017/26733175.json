However, its expression profile and the biological functions in pancreatic cancer remain unknown. In this study, we examined the expression pattern of FOXC2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissues and investigated the functions of FOXC2 in the progression of PDAC. It was found that the expression of FOXC2 was up-regulated in PDAC samples. Forced expression of FOXC2 promoted the growth and migration of the PDAC cells, while knocking down the expression of FOXC2 inhibited the growth and migration of the PDAC cells. Moreover, FOXC2 was found to interact with beta-catenin and promote cell growth by activating beta-catenin/TCF signaling. Taken together, this study demonstrated the oncogenic roles of FOXC2 in PDAC, and FOXC2 might be a therapeutic target for PDAC.
