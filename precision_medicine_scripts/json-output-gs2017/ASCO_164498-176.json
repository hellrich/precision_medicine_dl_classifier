Fusion of the kinase domain of the NTRK genes with various partners are oncogenic, and have been identified across many common tumor types, but generally at a frequency of \u003c 5%. In rare tumor types, such as mammary analogue secrectory carcinoma (MASC) and secretory breast carcinoma, NTRK fusion genes have been identified in greater than 75% of cases. LOXO-101 is a potent, oral, ATP-competitive pan-TRK inhibitor with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range for inhibition of TRK family members in binding and cellular assays, with \u003e 1000x selectivity over other kinases. LOXO-101 is the only selective pan-TRK inhibitor in clinical development and has demonstrated tumor inhibition in preclinical models and meaningful responses in an adult phase 1 trial. Methods: The phase II study of LOXO-101 (NCT02576431) is an open-label, multi-center trial for adult patients with advanced solid tumors and primary CNS malignancies harboring NTRK fusions. Patients  18 years old with NTRK1, 2, or 3 fusion-positive cancers who have progressed following standard therapy are eligible and assigned to one of 8 cohorts in a basket trial design. Eight anatomically defined subgroups have been prespecified for patients with: non-small cell lung, thyroid, sarcoma, colorectal, salivary and biliary cancers, CNS malignancies, and all others. Patients are required to have RECIST or RANO measurable disease for eligibility for cohorts 1-7. Patients without measurable disease may enroll in the all other anatomic sites cohort, number 8. Patients will undergo radiographic evaluation for their disease at regular intervals. LOXO-101 is administered orally BID in capsule form at 100mg for continuous 28-day cycles. Archival tissue and fresh tissue are required for post hoc central review of NTRK fusion status as well as the characterization of other molecular pathologic features.
