Upper endoscopy was performed in some selected patients.\nA total of 18 987 patients were enrolled with a response rate of 91.5%. The prevalence of symptom-defined GERD was 13.6% (2 579/18 987). A total of 4 357 (22.9%) patients underwent the upper endoscopy, and the diagnostic rates of reflux esophagitis, Barrett\u0027s esophagus, peptic ulcer disease, and upper gastrointestinal malignancy were 13.1% (572/4 357), 1.8% (78/4 357), 10.5% (456/4 357), and 1.7% (75/4 357), respectively. The incidence of reflux esophagitis was 22.7% (216/951) in patients with reflux symptoms and 10.5% (356/3 406) (P \u003c 0.001) in patients without reflux symptoms, 2.7% (26/951) and 1.5% (52/3 406), respectively (P \u003d 0.013) for Barrett\u0027s esophagus; 6.8% (65/951) and 11.5% (391/3 406), respectively (P \u003c 0.001) for peptic ulcer disease; 1.7% (16/951) and 1.7% (59/3 406), respectively (P \u003d 0.917) for upper gastrointestinal malignancy.\nGERD is one of the major diseases at gastroenterology clinic. Typical reflux symptoms suggest a diagnosis of GERD. But some patients with peptic ulcer disease or upper gastrointestinal malignancy can also present typical reflux symptoms. Upper endoscopy is valuable to avoid the misdiagnosis of other disorders.","title":"[The clinical significance of typical reflux symptoms in diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux disease].","pubmedId":"25264004"}
