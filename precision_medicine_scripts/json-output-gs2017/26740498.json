Tumour expression levels of BRCA1, TYMS and SRC were determined via real time quantitative PCR.\nPatients with KRAS mutations (n \u003d 3) had significantly shorter survival duration than patients with wild type KRAS (n \u003d 42). Tumour expression levels of BRCA1 and TYMS, but not SRC, were significantly lower in patients with, than in those without, KRAS mutations. Tumour expression level of BRCA1 was positively correlated with survival duration.\nKRAS mutation status and BRCA1 tumour expression are potential biomarkers for tailoring chemotherapy and predicting clinical outcome.","title":"Poor response to platinum-based chemotherapy is associated with KRAS mutation and concomitant low expression of BRAC1 and TYMS in NSCLC.","pubmedId":"26740498"}
