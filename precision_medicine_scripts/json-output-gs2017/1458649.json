Case 1 is a 32-year-old Japanese man who had a nodular melanoma in his epigastrium, associated with one subcutaneous nodule on the neck and another on the right thigh, both of which were histologically-proven schwannomas. Case 2 is a 48-year-old Japanese woman with an acral lentiginous melanoma on her right sole who later developed a schwannoma of the cerebello-pontine angle. Of all 146 malignant melanoma cases found in our clinic during the past 20 years, 1.4% were associated with a neurogenic tumour, a significant association.","title":"Malignant melanoma complicated by schwannoma.","pubmedId":"1458649"}
