The incidence, mortality and survival rate of female breast cancer were analyzed using routine and life table statistical methods.\nThere was a trend of annual increase by an average of 4.6% and 4.9% in the Beijing urban incidence and world population standardized incidence of female breast cancer during the period of 1982 to 2001. The epidemiological features of Beijing urban female breast cancer showed: (1) The incidence curve of different age groups from 25 to 80 years elevated with two peaks at age of \u003eor\u003d 45 and \u003eor\u003d 70 years; (2) There was an elevation in each age group during the last 20 years; (3) The interception rate at age of 35 to 64 reached 95.3/100,000 population, which made the breast cancer become the number one cancer in female. The changes of survival rate showed: the 5-year observed survival rate (OSR) increased from 62.0% in 1982 - 1983 to 68.7% in 1987 - 1988, the relative survival rate (RSR) increased from 66.3% to 74.2%. The OSR and RSR in 1987 - 1988 were 60.3% and 65.1% at 10 years, and 57.7% and 61.3% 15 years, respectively. The mortality rate of breast cancer fluctuated at 8 to 10 per 10(5) population during the last 20 years.\nThere is a trend of an annual increase in female breast cancer in Beijing. The 5-year survival is being improved gradually while the mortality rate remains stable. The results demonstrate that the \"early prevention, early diagnosis and early treatment\" principles for breast cancer is effective in Beijing.","title":"[Analysis of the incidence and survival of female breast cancer in Beijing during the last 20 years].","pubmedId":"16875607"}
