Recent evidence showed that TF expression is under the control of K-ras and p53. However, a comprehensive evaluation of TF expression, K-ras status, and p53 mutation has not been systematically analyzed. The aims of this study were to identify the percentages of positive TF in CRC patients; analyze the associations of TF expression, K-ras status, and p53 mutation; and evaluate the prognostic value of TF in CRC patients.\nNinety-six CRC samples were tested for TF expression, p53 mutation, and K-ras status by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry, Western blotting analysis, direct sequencing, and real-time quantitative PCR. Associations were sought with TF expression and clinical outcomes.\nTF expression was related to clinical stages, tumor differentiation, and tumor size. The positive proportions of TF expression on tumor cells and tumor vascular endothelial cells were 70% and 53% respectively in CRC patients. The positive proportion of TF co-expression on both cancer cells and tumor vascular endothelial cells was 40%, compared to an 83% total TF positive proportion in CRC patients. TF expression on CRC appeared to be increased with K-ras and/or p53 mutation(s). Disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly reduced in CRC patients with high TF expression.\nTF may participate in both K-ras and p53 mutations involved in colorectal carcinogenesis and could be considered as a prognostic indicator for patients CRC.","title":"Mutations of p53 and K-ras correlate TF expression in human colorectal carcinomas: TF downregulation as a marker of poor prognosis.","pubmedId":"21404058"}
