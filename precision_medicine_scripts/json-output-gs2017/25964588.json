ALK rearrangements, EGFR mutations and mutations in the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) are considered mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Herein we identified a KRAS Q22K mutation and frameshift mutations in the genes encoding serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated serine/threonine kinase (ATM) by next-generation sequencing in a patient with ALK rearrangement-positive oligo-metastatic NSCLC, whose disease progressed while on two ALK-targeted therapies. Such a complex diagnostic genetic profile has not been reported in ALK fusion-positive NSCLC. This case highlights the utility of comprehensive molecular testing in the diagnosis of NSCLC.
