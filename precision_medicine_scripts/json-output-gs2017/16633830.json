Gemcitabine given systemically seems to be effective; intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) has a deep rationale.\nThe goal was to evaluate the impact of postoperative IAC followed or not by systemic gemcitabine in patients after curative resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 5-fluoruracil 750 mg sq m(-1), leucovorin 75 mg sq m(-1), epirubicin 45 mg sq m(-1), carboplatin 225 mg sq m(-1) were administered every 3 weeks into celiac axis for three cycles (FLEC regimen), then gemcitabine at the dosage of 1 g sq m(-1) on days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks for 3 months (FLECG regimen).\nForty-seven patients entered the study. The first 24 received only IAC (FLEC regimen), the other 23 received the same intra-arterial regimen followed by systemic gemcitabine (FLECG regimen). After a median follow-up of 16.9 months, 29 patients recurred (61.7%). Median disease free survival (DFS) was 18 months and median overall survival (OS) was 29.7 months. One-year DFS was 59.4% and 1-year OS was 75.5%. Main grade 3 toxicity related to IAC was only nausea/vomiting in 4%; regarding gemcitabine, grade 3 toxicities were anaemia 8%, leukopenia 8%, thrombocitopenia 17%, nausea/vomiting 4%.\nFLEC regimen with or without gemcitabine is active with a very mild toxicity and results are very encouraging in an adjuvant setting.","title":"Adjuvant intra-arterial 5-fluoruracil, leucovorin, epirubicin and carboplatin with or without systemic gemcitabine after curative resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"16633830"}
