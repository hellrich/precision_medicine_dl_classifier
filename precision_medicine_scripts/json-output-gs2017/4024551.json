Transformed NIH 3T3 cells appeared to be highly tumorigenic in newborn BALB/c mice. The analysis of DNA samples isolated from primary and secondary NIH 3T3 transformants identified Alu-repetitive DNA sequences of human genome as well as additional sequences homologous to ras-family oncogene. Transforming c-Ha-ras I gene was identified for the first time in NIH 3T3 cells transformed by preparations of DNA isolated from human malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma and breast cancer.","title":"[Identification of the transforming Ha-ras gene in human melanoma, neuroblastoma and breast cancer cells].","pubmedId":"4024551"}
