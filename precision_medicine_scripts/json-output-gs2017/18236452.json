Cases in males are far less common, and reported cases in elderly males are rare.\nWe report the case of 72-year- old male admitted to a geriatric psychiatry service for grave passive neglect with mild dementia thought to be due to nutritional deficiency.\nThe patient was found to have an eating disorder not otherwise specified, most closely resembling anorexia nervosa, which was believed to be the cause of the nutritional problem.\nThis case highlights the need for diagnostic awareness regarding eating disorders in patients of all ages and of both genders.","title":"Severe eating disorder initially diagnosed in a 72-year-old man.","pubmedId":"18236452"}
