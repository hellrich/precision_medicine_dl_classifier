Among targets, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are among the most promising. ROR1 is a transmembrane RTK of importance during the normal embryogenesis for the central nervous system, heart, lung and skeletal systems, but is not expressed in normal adult tissues. However, ROR1 is overexpressed in several human malignancies and may act as a survival factor for tumor cells. Its unique expression by malignant cells may provide a target for novel therapeutics including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (TKI) for the treatment of cancer. Promising preclinical results have been reported in e.g. chronic lymphocytic leukemia, pancreatic carcinoma, lung and breast cancer. ROR1 might also be an interesting oncofetal antigen for active immunotherapy. In this review, we provide an overview of the ROR1 structure and functions in cancer and highlight emerging therapeutic options of interest for targeting ROR1 in tumor therapy.","title":"The receptor tyrosine kinase ROR1--an oncofetal antigen for targeted cancer therapy.","pubmedId":"25068995"}
