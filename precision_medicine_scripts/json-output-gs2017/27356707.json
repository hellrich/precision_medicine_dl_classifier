There are several prognostic biomarkers like nuclear receptors whose over-expression is associated with BC characteristics. These biomarkers can be blocked by compounds with anti-cancer potential but selection must be made on the basis of no adverse side effects. This study is focused on finding of compounds from a plant source garlic.\nTwenty compounds from garlic and five targets considered involved in BC were retrieved from Pubchem database and Protein Data Bank respectively. They were docked using Accelrys Discovery Studio (DS) 4.0. The compounds which showed interaction were checked for drug likeliness.\nDocking studies and ADMET evaluation revealed twelve compounds to be active against the targets. All the compounds displayed highly negative dock scores which indicated good interactions.\nThe results of this study should help researchers and scientists in the pharmaceutical field to identify drugs based on garlic.","title":"Garlic Phytocompounds Possess Anticancer Activity by Specifically Targeting Breast Cancer Biomarkers - an in Silico Study.","pubmedId":"27356707"}
