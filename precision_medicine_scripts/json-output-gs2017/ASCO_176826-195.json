As a result, more patients became eligible for EGFR antibody therapy. Weexamined KRAS testing practice among patients with mCRC who received systemic cancer treatment in Denmark during 2009-2013. Methods: We linked data from several population registries with nationwide coverage - the Danish Cancer Registry, the Danish National Patient Registry, and the Danish National Pathology Registry - to identify patients diagnosed with mCRC (primary or recurrent) between 2009 and 2013, their systemic cancer treatment, and their KRAS testing status. We obtained all KRAS test results through 2014 and calculated proportions of KRAS-tested patients by year of mCRC diagnosis. Results: There were 7,245 mCRC patients, among whom 4,272 (59%) had a record of systemic cancer treatment within 6 months of mCRC diagnosis and were included in the analysis. The proportion of men was 57%; median age at mCRC diagnosis was 67 years (range 20-94 years). Overall, 2,099/4,272 (49%) of the treated mCRC patients had a recorded KRAS test result, with similar proportions for patients with primary and recurrent mCRC. Among patients diagnosed with mCRC in 2009, the proportion with a recorded KRAS test result was 374/900 (42%). Corresponding proportions for patients diagnosed in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 were 411/891 (46%), 457/870 (52%), 430/807 (53%), and 427/804 (53%). Conclusions: Among patients in Denmark diagnosed with mCRC who received systemic cancer treatment, the proportion of patients with a KRAS test result recorded in the Danish National Pathology Registry increased from 2009 to 2013. This may have resulted from increased testing or increased recording, or both.","title":"KRAS testing practice in Denmark between 2009 and 2013.","pubmedId":"ASCO_176826-195"}
