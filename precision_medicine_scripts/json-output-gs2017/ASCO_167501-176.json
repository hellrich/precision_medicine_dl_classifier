Hyperspectral (HS) imaging is a passive, non-ionizing diagnostic method that has garnered increased interest for its ability to detect multiple tumor types and even neoplastic biomarkers. We sought to explore the ability to use HS spectroscopy for transluminal identification of tumor specimens during surgical resection of colorectal cancers. Methods: This study was approved by Johns Hopkins Hospital IRB (IRB00056516). A cohort of patients with confirmed or suspected colorectal cancer who underwent operative resection were enrolled. HS measurements (Labspec 5000, ASD, Inc, Boulder, CO) of resected specimens both intra- and transluminally was performed immediately after resection and again after gross pathologic examination. Spectral results were analyzed with linear discriminant analysis in pairwise comparisons between normal and cancer tissue, and correlated with pathologic evaluation. Results: Eleven patient specimens were successfully analyzed. In 2 patients, histologic evaluation revealed inflammatory disease only. HS spectroscopy accurately predicted an absence of tumor specimen in these samples. For patients with confirmed colorectal cancer, transluminal spectroscopy was able to detect 86% of tumor specimens with a 0% false positive rate (sensitivity 86%, specificity 100%). For intraluminal specimens, spectral tumor detection rate of 100% with no false positives (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). Spectral waveforms did not differ significantly before and after gross pathologic examination. Conclusions: HS measurements have high sensitivity (86-100%) and specificity (100%) for the real-time detection of colorectal cancer imaged through the bowel wall and intraluminally. Further, signal fidelity does not appear to degrade within the first 30 minutes following resection. High-resolution optical spectroscopy is a potentially useful tool in the operative management of colorectal cancer. These findings also have implications for the development of advanced diagnostic methods, including endoscopic evaluation.","title":"Passive hyperspectral sensing to identify colorectal cancer in intraoperative colon specimens.","pubmedId":"ASCO_167501-176"}
