We evaluated 13 extragastric GISTs and compared them with 56 gastric GISTs, which were described previously. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, and exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of the KIT gene and exons 12 and 18 of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Immunohistochemistry was performed for KIT, CD34, Ki-67 (as a marker of cell proliferation), and CD31 (as a marker of microvessel density), and apoptosis was assessed by in situ DNA nick end-labeling. Of the 13 extragastric GISTs 7 (54%) had a mutation in exon 11 of KIT, and 2 (15%) had a mutation in exon 13 of KIT. Deletions in exon 11 of KIT were the most common mutation encountered in the extragastric GISTs. The extragastric GISTs, especially small intestinal GISTs, showed larger deletions, leading to deletions of amino acid residues in the KIT protein, and higher vascularity than did the gastric GISTs. These data suggest that extragastric GISTs differ from gastric GISTs with respect to associated mutations and angiogenic activity.","title":"Genetic and pathologic characteristics of gastrointestinal stromal tumors in extragastric lesions.","pubmedId":"17089009"}
