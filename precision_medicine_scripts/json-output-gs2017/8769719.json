Following the start of a national melanoma awareness campaign, relevant general practice consultations with men \u003e or \u003d 55 increased 2.6-fold (95% CI: 2.1 to 3.6); consultations with men \u003c 45 increased 5.1-fold (4.1 to 6.9). Men \u003e or \u003d 55 tended to have a longer duration of symptoms than men \u003c 55. Age-standardized mortality rates increased consistently in the period from 1949 to 1989. The data suggest a birth cohort-dependent increase in melanoma mortality which appears to involve increased incidence and decreased case fatality rates, and which could explain at least part of the high proportion of lesions with poor prognosis that occur in middle-aged and older men, and older women.","title":"Melanoma mortality in middle-aged and older men, and older women in New Zealand.","pubmedId":"8769719"}
