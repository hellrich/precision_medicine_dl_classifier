Novel therapeutic approaches are mandatory in order to improve the situation. Everolimus, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, as well as the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib, has demonstrated a substantial therapeutic effect in various types of human cancer with moderate side-effects. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1 and 2, and of the tumor-suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) were evaluated in chemonaïve human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and -negative squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and after exposure to everolimus, sorafenib or sunitinib.\np16-positive CERV196 and p16-negative HNSCC 11A and 14C cells were incubated with different drug concentrations for 48-192 h. Expression of VEGFR1 and -2 as well as PTEN were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and was compared to a chemonaïve control.\nVEGFR1 and -2, as well as PTEN, were expressed in all three cell lines. Sunitinib, sorafenib and everolimus significantly reduced the expression of VEGFR1 and -2, especially in p16-positive CERV196 cells. Sunitinib appeared to be more effective in reducing VEGFR1 and -2 expression than sorafenib and everolimus. PTEN levels were remarkably lower in HPV-positive CERV196 cells. PTEN expression increased significantly under sunitinib and sorafenib in HNSCC 11A and CERV196 cells. Everolimus, on the other hand, led to a significant decrease of PTEN expression in these cell lines.\nThe tested drugs displayed a remarkable anti-angiogenic effect by inhibition of VEGFR1 and -2 expression. Sunitinib and sorafenib were able to increase PTEN expression, which might induce apoptosis of cancer cells. HPV-positive CERV196 cells were characterized by an increased susceptibility to these small-molecule drugs. Further studies are imperative to scrutinize HPV status-dependent differences in drug response and possible implications for future treatment options.","title":"Small molecules alter VEGFR and PTEN expression in HPV-positive and -negative SCC: new hope for targeted-therapy.","pubmedId":"25750290"}
