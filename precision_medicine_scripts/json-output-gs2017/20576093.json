The relation of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, medication usage, and APOE epsilon4 to dementia was modelled using adjusted multivariable logistic regression.\nTreated stroke (odds ratio [OR] 3.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0, 7.2), untreated stroke (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7, 7.3), and APOE epsilon4 (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.7, 4.5) all increased the odds of dementia. Treated hypertension was associated with lower odds of dementia (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3, 1.0). Diabetes and heart disease were not significantly associated with dementia. A significant interaction was observed between APOE epsilon4 and stroke (P \u003d 0.001).\nData from the first dementia study that is representative of the United States population suggest that stroke, the APOE epsilon4 allele and their interaction are strongly associated with dementia.","title":"Vascular health, diabetes, APOE and dementia: the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study.","pubmedId":"20576093"}
