Therefore, we investigated a cohort of 198 patients with STSs of six entities with known p53 IHC by using a multivariate Cox regression model to determine the prognostic value of Mdm2 staining. Only positivity with the 19E3 Ab correlated multivariately significantly with survival (RR \u003d 2.32, p \u003d 0.0035). We stratified the C-terminal Mdm2 staining (19E3) according to p53 IHC (DO-1) and found patients could be divided into three groups with an increasing risk: (a) patients with Mdm2 (19E3)-negative as well as p53 (DO-1)-negative tumors, (b) patients with tumors that were either Mdm2 (19E3) or p53 (DO-1) positive, and (c) patients with tumors that were Mdm2 (19E3) as well as p53 (DO-1) positive. Positive staining for both Mdm2 and p53 meant a very poor prognosis with a relative risk of 4.63 (p \u003d 0.00001). This points to the possibility that--in addition to the p53-dependent pathway--Mdm2 could have an effect through a p53-independent pathway. Thus, our results indicate that C-terminal Mdm2 staining (19E3) constitutes an independent prognostic marker in STS.","title":"Prognostic relevance of C-terminal Mdm2 detection is enhanced by p53 positivity in soft tissue sarcomas.","pubmedId":"9458382"}
