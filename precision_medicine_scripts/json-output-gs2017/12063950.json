However, the clinical implications of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are poorly understood. We investigated the microsatellite instability, K-ras gene mutations and p53 protein overexpression and their correlation with clinicopathological features to elucidate the clinical implications of genetic alterations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\nIn twenty-three cases of surgically treated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, microsatellite instability was examined by a PCR-SSCP analysis and K-ras gene mutation by a PCR-RFLP analysis, p53 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the correlation between genetic alterations and clinicopathological features.\nMicrosatellite instability was observed in one case (4.7%), K-ras gene mutation in 9 (39.1%) and positive staining for p53 protein in 5 (21.7%). The incidence of K-ras gene mutations in hilar type intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (6 of 8, 75.0%) was significantly higher than that in peripheral type intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (3 of 15, 20.0%) (P \u003c 0.05). Furthermore, the incidence of K-ras gene mutations in patients with lymph node metastasis (58.3%) tended to be higher than that in patients without lymph node metastasis (18.2%). The patients with K-ras gene mutations showed a statistically significant worse survival rate than those without such mutations (P \u003c 0.05). No statistically significant correlations were observed between the p53 overexpression and clinicopathological features.\nThese data suggest that K-ras gene mutations may be involved in the carcinogenesis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, especially in hilar type intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and thus may be correlated with aggressive biological behavior.","title":"Analysis of microsatellite instability, K-ras gene mutation and p53 protein overexpression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"12063950"}
