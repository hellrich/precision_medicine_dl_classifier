KRAS gene mutation in exon 3 mainly involved codons 59 and 61. KRAS gene mutation in exon 4 mainly involved codons 117 and 146.\nMutations at exon 2 of KRAS gene have the highest frequency in colorectal carcinoma. Expanding the detection sites of KRAS gene combined with NRAS and BRAF genes may help to identify patients who will most likely benefit from targeted therapies.","title":"[Detection of KRAS,NRAS and BRAF gene mutations in colorectal carcinoma].","pubmedId":"25975908"}
