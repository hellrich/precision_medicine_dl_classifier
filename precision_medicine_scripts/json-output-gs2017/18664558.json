We studied whether trastuzumab therapy beyond or after BM was beneficial to patients with BM.\nThe effect of trastuzumab on survival after BM was analyzed in 78 HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Patients were grouped according to trastuzumab therapy; no treatment and treatment before and after BM were diagnosed.\nOverall survival after the diagnosis of BM as well as time to progression (TTP) of intracranial tumors was prolonged in patients who received trastuzumab after BM was diagnosed. Conversely, BM occurred much later in patients who received trastuzumab before BM. In the multivariate Cox regression model, age at BM \u003c50 years, disease-free interval \u003eor\u003d24 months, TTP of intracranial tumor \u003eor\u003d4.8 months, and trastuzumab treatment after BM were significantly associated with longer survival after the onset of BM.\nTrastuzumab therapy after the onset of BM in HER2-positive breast cancer patients is associated with a significant survival benefit after BM diagnosis compared with patients who never received or completed trastuzumab before the BM diagnosis.","title":"Trastuzumab treatment beyond brain progression in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.","pubmedId":"18664558"}
