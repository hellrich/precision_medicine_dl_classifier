This hematologic abnormality may predispose patients to coronary thrombosis and unstable angina. The incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia in such patients is unknown. Suitable electrocardiograms and clinical events of consecutive patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (n \u003d 45) and major intraabdominal surgery (n \u003d 28) during a 3-month period at a major university teaching hospital and transplant center were examined retrospectively. Clinical myocardial ischemia or ischemic electrocardiographic changes, or both, occurred in 6 transplant patients compared with no patient in the nontransplant or comparison group. In 4 of the 6 patients with dramatic electrocardiographic changes and ischemic events, coronary arteriography failed to demonstrate significant obstructive disease. It is concluded that severe myocardial ischemia may occur in patients after orthotopic liver transplantation in the absence of significant coronary disease. A hypercoagulable state may predispose to coronary thrombosis in this setting, providing insight (and a future model for study) into the development of unstable angina.","title":"Myocardial ischemia after orthotopic liver transplantation.","pubmedId":"8017307"}
