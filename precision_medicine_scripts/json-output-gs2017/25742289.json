The ROS1 fusion status was examined by FISH and qRT-PCR assay.\nAmong 60 cases, 16 (26.7%), 13 (21.7%) and 20 (33.3%) cases were ROS1 positive revealed by IHC, FISH and qRT-PCR, respectively. Using FISH as a standard method for ROS1 fusion detection, the sensitivity and specificity of IHC were 100% and 93.6%, respectively. Three IHC-positive cases, which showed FISH negative, were demonstrated with ROS1 fusion by qRT-PCR analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of qRT-PCR for detection for ROS1 fusion were 100% and 85.1%, respectively. The total concordance rate between IHC and qRT-PCR were 93.3%.\nIHC is a reliable and rapid screening tool in routine pathologic laboratories for the identification of suitable candidates for ROS1-targeted therapy. Some ROS1 IHC-positive but FISH-negative cases did harbor the translocation events and may benefit from crizotinib.","title":"Detection of ROS1 gene rearrangement in lung adenocarcinoma: comparison of IHC, FISH and real-time RT-PCR.","pubmedId":"25742289"}
