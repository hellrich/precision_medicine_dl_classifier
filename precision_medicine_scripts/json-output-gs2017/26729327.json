Tests for secondary HT showed a marked increase of serum renin and aldosterone both in clinostatic (342 pg/ml and 907 pmol/l, respectively) and orthostatic posture (351 pg/ml and 2845 pmol/l, respectively), hypokalemia (2.9 mmol/l) and macroalbuminuria (431 mg/day). Diagnostic examinations also revealed a focal stenosis of approximately 70 % of the proximal right renal artery with post-stenotic dilation. After percutaneous balloon angioplasty and stent implantation, BP was normalized with 5 mg/day amlodipine and psychiatric symptoms suddenly disappeared.\nPsychopathological symptoms are rare at the onset of hyperaldosteronism, and their aetiology is not well defined. A proper diagnostic and therapeutic process is mandatory in order to get the recommended therapeutic targets in short-midterm improving long-term prognosis. We also suggest not considering depressed or treat with antidepressant agents a young hypertensive subject with uncontrolled hypertension despite multiple anti-hypertensive medications without having ruled out a secondary form of hypertension.","title":"Mood Disorders in Uncontrolled Hypertension Despite Multiple Anti-Hypertensive Medications: Searching for a Link.","pubmedId":"26729327"}
