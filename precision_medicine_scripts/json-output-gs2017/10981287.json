These include the taxanes docetaxel (Taxotere) and paclitaxel (Taxol); the nucleoside analog gemcitabine (Gemzar); the vinca alkaloid vinorelbine (Navelbine); the topoisomerase-I inhibitor irinotecan (Camptosar, CPT-11); and the bioreductive agent tirapazamine. Cisplatin (Platinol), which has been the \"backbone\" of combination chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC because of its proven single-agent activity, has been examined in combination with these agents as well as radiation and surgery in numerous trials. This article summarizes trials of these combination therapies in the treatment of NSCLC.","title":"Chemotherapy in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"10981287"}
