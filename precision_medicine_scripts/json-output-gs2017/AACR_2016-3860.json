Proteochemometric computational methods coupled with kinase assays showed that MBZ binds and inhibits kinases important in cancer, especially both BRAFWT and BRAFV600E. We find that MBZ synergizes with the MEK inhibitor trametinib to inhibit growth of dabrafenib-resistant BRAFWT-NRASQ61K melanoma cells in culture and in xenografts, and markedly decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation in vivo. RPPA and immunoblot analyses show that both trametinib and MBZ inhibit the MAPK pathway, and cluster analysis revealed a protein cluster showing strong MBZ+trametinib - inhibited phosphorylation of MEK and ERK within 10 minutes, and its direct and indirect downstream targets related to stress response and translation, including ElK1 and RSKs within 30 minutes. Downstream ERK targets for cell cycle, including cMYC, were downregulated, consistent with S phase suppression by MBZ+trametinib, while apoptosis markers, including cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP and a sub-G1 population, were all increased with time. These data suggest that MBZ, an off-patent approved drug with no major side effects, should be considered as a therapeutic option in combination with trametinib, for patients with NRASQ61mut or other non-V600E BRAF mutant melanomas.","title":"The repurposed anthelmintic mebendazole in combination with trametinib suppresses refractory NRASQ61K melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-3860"}
