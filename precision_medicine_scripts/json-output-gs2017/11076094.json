We measured serum IGF-II levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 20 controls, 26 CIN patients, 12 with cervical cancer before therapy, 5 with cervical cancer for \u003c 1 year, and 9 others \u003e 1 year after therapy.\nThe levels of cervical EGF-R in women with CIN and cervical cancer were significantly higher (P\u003c0.05 for CIN I; P\u003c0.001 for patients with CIN II and III or cervical cancer) than in controls. Women with cervical cancer (P\u003c0.001 vs. controls) or advanced CIN (P \u003d 0.03) had elevated levels of serum IGF-II, while the women with CIN I had levels similar to controls. Women with cervical cancer in the post-therapy period had significantly lower serum IGF-II levels than the women with cervical cancer before therapy (P\u003c0.001).\nCervical epithelial EGF-R and serum IGF-II levels may be used for the diagnosis and prognosis of cervical cancer.","title":"Cervical epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R) and serum insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) levels are potential markers for cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"11076094"}
