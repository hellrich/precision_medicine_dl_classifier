In this issue, Siroy et al. demonstrate how clinical genetic analysis is moving from a single-gene Sanger-sequencing approach to targeted next-generation sequencing. They present data on a large cohort of patients with advanced melanoma, and their data support previous findings and also present novel aspects of melanoma genetics.
