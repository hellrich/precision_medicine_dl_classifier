During January 1 of 1996 to December 31 of 2005, were analyzed new cases of adolescents of 15 and 16-year-old with malignant neoplasms in adolescents at IMSS. The neo-plasms were grouped according with the International Classification of Childhood Cancer; they were stratified by age, sex, and place of residence, and the frequency of these variables were obtained.\na total of 207 cases were registered. Leukemias were more frequent with 55 cases (26.6%); the second place was for bone tumors with 36 cases (17.4%) and the third place were lymphomas with 32 cases (15.5%). There were not cases of retinoblastoma and renal tumors; only 8 cases of carcinomas (3.9%) were registered. The greatest frequency was observed in males with 116 cases (56.0%), with male/female ratio of 1.3:1. Mexico City and State of Mexico were more frequent places of residence with 70.5% of cases. Near of forty nine percent of cases (48.8%) with solid tumors were diagnosed in III or IV stages.\nthe pattern of cancer was different from older adolescents (15 to 19-year-old), it is necessary to conduct studies of survey in order to determine epidemiology of cancer in the Mexican adolescents.","title":"[Cancer epidemiology in adolescents of 15 and 16-year-old].","pubmedId":"19213206"}
