It represents one of the newest molecular targets in NSCLC. We report on the case of a metachronous second primary lung sarcomatoid carcinoma after resection of lung adenocarcinoma both with ALK translocation, in a non-smoking patient. EML4-ALK rearrangement was detected with immunohistochemistry and confirmed with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). To assess the clonal relationship between the two tumors, both adenocarcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma were analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). We observed different genomic profiles suggesting that the tumors arose independently and were thus multiple primaries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report concerning the presence of the EML4-ALK fusion gene in a sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung. Crizotinib, the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is highly effective in ALK-rearranged NSCLC; therefore, it may be imperative to identify all NSCLC that harbor ALK translocations in the near future. Starting from our evidence, tumors with sarcomatoid histology may need to be screened for the presence of EML4-ALK rearrangement.
