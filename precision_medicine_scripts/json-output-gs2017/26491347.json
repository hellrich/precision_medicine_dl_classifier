As a consequence, targeted therapy based on screening of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is necessary. Spinal cord metastasis of lung cancer is a serious clinical problem. Here, we report a case of lung adenocarcinoma with severe spinal cord metastasis that was successfully treated with a second administration of an EGFR-TKI. Magnetic resonance imaging showed spinal cord metastasis to the cervical vertebrae. The patient received a second administration of an EGFR-TKI (150 mg/day erlotinib). Four months later, we observed the disappearance of the paravertebral tumor and a reduction in the size of pulmonary tumors in both lungs. These results indicate that EGFR-TKI therapy could be a new strategy for the treatment of advanced lung adenocarcinoma with spinal metastasis.
