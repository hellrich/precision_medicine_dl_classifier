Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) are currently used for screening but are unable to identify the specific fusion partner and are unpractical to monitor clinical responses due to difficulty of obtaining rebiopsies. The RT-PCR technique has the potential to overcome this pitfall and allow patient monitorization in blood.Methods: A total of 405 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from advanced NSCLC were analyzed by ALK IHC (Ventana D5F3) and FISH (Vysis). Positive patients were confirmed by RT-PCR and submitted to Sanger in order to identify the variant. In a subset of 36 patients with EML4-ALK-rearranged tumors who were treated with crizotinib, fusion transcripts were analyzed by RT-PCR in mRNA purified from plasma and platelets and correlated with clinical response.Results: ALK IHC was analyzed in 405 NSCLC patients and 37 tested positive (9.1%) whereas 25 (7.7%) were identify as translocated by FISH (n\u003d323). ALK fusion transcripts were analyzed by RT-PCR and a new fusion variant of ALK was identified. A total of 36 p benefited from crizotinib treatment, including the p with the new variant. Monitoring of EML4-ALK fusion transcripts in the plasma ad platelets of 35 ALK positive patients revealed a good correlation with clinical outcome to crizotinib treatment, with the fusion transcripts becoming undetectable in p with good clinical responses.Conclusions: Analysis of ALK fusion transcripts in mRNA purified from plasma and platelets can have a value in patients with no biopsy available and to monitor the course of the disease.","title":"Analysis of EML4-ALK fusion transcripts in plasma and platelets to monitor response to crizotinib in EML4-ALK positive non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC).","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-1739"}
