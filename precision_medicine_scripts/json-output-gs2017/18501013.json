Port site metastasis after laparoscopy for a GIST is an extremely rare phenomenon.\nWe report a case with relevant imaging and discuss factors that may have contributed to the development of this isolated metastasis.\nPercutaneous methods of sampling GIST tumours for analysis should be avoided if at all possible. When necessary, prophylactic measures should be utilised to minimise the risk of seeding.","title":"Port site metastasis following diagnostic laparoscopy for a malignant Gastro-intestinal stromal tumour.","pubmedId":"18501013"}
