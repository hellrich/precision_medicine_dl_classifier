Dissemination occurs more often via haematogenous way than by lymphatic way. The incidence of local recurrence is higher than distant metastases. The treatment of choice is the wide excision. Adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended in the well differentiated and myxoid type of tumors if the local control during excision is not complete or wide enough. Benefit of chemotherapy is still controversial and limited. Case report of a stage 1 liposarcoma of the spermatic cord, four years after excision of a large lipoma during a hernia repair. The treatment consisted in radical excision of this liposarcoma without any adjuvant therapy. Follow-up of 30 months without recurrence.","title":"[Liposarcoma of the spermatic cord].","pubmedId":"8984855"}
