Practically usable morphological criteria, which allow an efficient differential diagnosis of these lesions have been determined by a number of authors. The perineural and vascular invasion represent findings, which are entirely diagnostic for PDA; however, they are rarely detectable in small biopsy specimens as well as in the presence of solitary naked ducts in fat without surrounding pancreatic elements or fibrous tissue, which also supports the diagnosis of PDA. The features that are suggestive of PDA include random haphazard distribution of ductal structures, irregular ductal contours, ruptured ducts, nuclear enlargement, pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, and mitoses. Uniterrupted proliferation of numerous ducts (\u003e50), ducts lying adjacent to arterioles, intraluminal cellular debris, and hyperchromatic raisinoid nuclei represent less frequently displayed features that also support the diagnosis of PDA. On the contrary, the preserved lobular arrangement, clusters of uniform ductal units, smooth ductal contours, ducts related to the remaining acini and islets, and finding of intraluminnal mucoprotein plugs favor a benign process over PDA.        The combination of presented criteria and features should enable a reliable differential diagnosis of invasive pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis.\nchronic pancreatitis - pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma - pseudotumor - differential diagnosis.","title":"[Differential diagnosis of the chronic pancreatitis and the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"23057427"}
