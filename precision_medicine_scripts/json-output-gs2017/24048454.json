We retrospectively analyzed survival data in 2 Belgian centers in a nonselected population.\nBetween January 2004 and October 2011, 48 patients with histologically proven recurrent or unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had received CFL as second-line treatment were identified. We retrospectively analyzed the following parameters: progression-free survival (PFS1 and PFS2) for each line (after the start of first and second line), overall survival (OS), and growth modulation index.\nThe median PFS1 was 5.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-6.6). The median PFS2 was 3.6 months (95% CI, 2-5.2). The median OS was 12 months (95% CI, 9.3-14.7). Twenty-three percent of patients had a growth modulation index \u003e1.33.\nWe show an OS of 12 months with gemcitabine in first-line and CFL in second-line therapy for pancreatic cancer. Sequential therapy with good OS and good quality of life may be preferred to strong upfront therapy in an incurable disease such as pancreatic cancer.","title":"Cisplatin-modified de Gramont in second-line therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24048454"}
