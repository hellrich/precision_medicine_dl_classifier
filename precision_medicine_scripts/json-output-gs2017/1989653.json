Both genes are members of the fibroblast growth factor family. In the present study, coamplification (2-15 copies) of the INT2/HST1 genes was found in 27 (9%) of 311 invasive human breast carcinomas using slot blot and Southern blot analyses. Amplification was not correlated to tumour size, axillary lymph node status or stage of disease, neither to patient age nor menopausal status. However, 26 (96%) of the 27 amplified tumours were, often strongly, Oestrogen receptor positive compared to 65% of the unamplified cases (P \u003d 0.001). These findings are in sharp contrast to the strong correlations of HER-2/neu proto-oncogene amplification with advanced stage and steroid receptor negativity, previously observed in the same series of tumours. Patients with INT2/HST1 amplified breast cancer had a significantly shorter disease-free survival compared to those with unamplified genes (P \u003d 0.015, median follow up 45 months). This correlation was confined to node-negative patients and persisted in multivariate analysis. No significant correlation to survival from breast cancer was found. It is concluded that amplification of the 11q13 region in breast cancer occurs in a particular subset of aggressive tumours, quite different from that identified by HER-2/neu amplification. It still remains to be shown that the selection for amplified genes at 11q13 is due to the activity of INT2, HST1 or yet another, still unidentified, neighbouring gene. However, the results are potentially of clinical value in separating a group of node-negative breast cancer for more intense treatment.","title":"Association of INT2/HST1 coamplification in primary breast cancer with hormone-dependent phenotype and poor prognosis.","pubmedId":"1989653"}
