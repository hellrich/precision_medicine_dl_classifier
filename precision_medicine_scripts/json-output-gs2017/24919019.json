It has been brought to our attention that, as a result of a miscommunication, the antibody used in this study in order to determine the expression of p95 HER2 in metastatic breast cancer patients is in fact directed against p95 NBS1, a component of the MRN complex, and is completely unrelated to p95 HER2. Therefore, a relationship between p95 HER2 overexpression and outcome cannot be established based on the results described and we wish to retract our paper. The authors, the editors of British Journal of Cancer, and the referees of this paper are grateful to colleagues in the field who have brought this problem to our attention and we apologise for any confusion that has, inadvertently, been caused.","title":"Clinical significance of p95HER2 overexpression, PTEN loss and PI3K expression in p185HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab-based therapies.","pubmedId":"24919019"}
