Liposarcoma s types, according to his histological diagnosis, are: mixoide, pleomorphic, well differentiated and dedifferentiated. It can get to reach enormous proportions, mainly when it is located at abdominal level. His treatment is the radical surgery, it is possible, together with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Four patients diagnosed of liposarcoma are shown up, a case of liposarcoma well differentiated, another case of liposarcoma pleomorphic and two cases about liposarcoma mixoide; with the characteristic that one of these two cases presented a local recidivation with a dediferenciation of itself. The evolution of the four cases, was in a different way. So, their prognosis is going to depend on their histopathologic variety and on a possible multicentricidad that is going to difficult the complete radical surgical exeresis.","title":"[Liposarcoma histologic subtypes: four cases reports].","pubmedId":"17867902"}
