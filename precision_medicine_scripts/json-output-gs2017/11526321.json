An activated complex of human CDK6 with a viral cyclin from herpesvirus saimiri was purified to homogeneity and crystallized using polyethylene glycol 3350 as precipitant. Crystallization was critically dependent on a narrow range of calcium acetate concentration and the presence of sulfo-betaine 201 as additive. Crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6(1)22 or P6(5)22, with unit-cell parameters a \u003d b \u003d 70.14, c \u003d 448.77 A, gamma \u003d 120 degrees, and diffract X-rays to at least 3.1 A resolution.","title":"Crystallization of a complex between human CDK6 and a virus-encoded cyclin is critically dependent on the addition of small charged organic molecules.","pubmedId":"11526321"}
