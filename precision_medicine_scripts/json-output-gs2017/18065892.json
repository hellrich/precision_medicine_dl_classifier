It is primarily revealed by the onset of retention jaundice. Only 20%-30% of patients can undergo resection at diagnosis. The only chance for survival for these patients is R0 resection, which requires hepatectomy associated with resection of the common bile duct and pedicle lymph node removal, whatever the classification of the cholangiocarcinoma. No adjuvant treatment has been shown to be effective to date. Palliative treatment is most often based on implanting a biliary stent. Dynamic phototherapy may be beneficial in these situations. Improvements in survival for selected N0 hilar cholangiocarcinoma may be obtained with neoadjuvant treatment with radiochemotherapy followed by liver transplantation.","title":"[Management of hilar cholangiocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"18065892"}
