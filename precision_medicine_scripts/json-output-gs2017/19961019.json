The articles were retrieved with the entries of \"gastrointestinal stromal tumors\", \"imatinib\", \"c-kit\" and \"mutation\". A meta-analysis was performed to assess the data included.\nA total of 15 articles were collected in this analysis. No significant differences was found in incidence of mitoses (\u003e 5/50 HPF) between the patients with wild type c-kit (wild type group) and the ones with mutated c-kit (mutation group) (P \u003d 0.710); tumor recurrence and metastasis rate after surgery was significant higher in the mutation group than that in wild type group (P \u003d 0.010); as for imatinib response with different c-kit mutation types, the results showed the incidence of clinical response (complete response + partial response) was significantly higher in mutation group than that in wild type group (P \u003d 0.009), but the imatinib resistance rate was lower in mutation group (P \u003d 0.000); three studies provided data for imatinib resistance with c-kit second mutations, the results showed the second mutations mainly focus on exon 13, 14, 17.\nC-kit mutation is related closely with the incidence of recurrence and metastasis in GIST after surgery. The mutations of c-kit influences the therapeutic effects of imatinib.","title":"[Effect of c-kit mutation on the prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a meta-analysis].","pubmedId":"19961019"}
