Most of them present during childhood. The classical triad right upper quadrant pain, jaundice and abdominal mass is present only in a few instances. We report here the bile duct cysts which were diagnosed at our institution from 1989 to 1996.\n3245 consecutive endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograms (ERCP) were evaluated retrospectively. Diagnosis was made when localized cystic dilations of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary tract were present. Diffuse dilations of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tract were excluded.\nBile duct cysts were found in 20 patients (17 females, 3 males) among 3245 ERCPs. Their mean age was 56 +/- 20 (median 64, range 10 to 83) years. The cyst types (according to the Alonso-Lej classification with the Todani modification) were type I in 11 (55%), type II, III and IV in two instances each (10%), and type V (or Caroli\u0027s disease) in 3 patients (15%). Leading symptoms were cholestasis in 14 patients, 10 of whom had abdominal pain, jaundice in 4 patients, and single cases of pancreatitis, cholangitis, and abdominal mass. In 2 patients the diagnosis was made incidentally. 10 patients had bile duct stones. We performed endoscopic sphincterotomy in 15 patients with concretions or persistent symptoms, 3 patients had cyst resection. One of these, with a type I cyst, already had a disseminated cholangiocarcinoma. 10 of 17 patients without cyst resection are currently symptom-free after complete removal of all gallstones. One male patient with cholecystolithiasis, who is not operable due to advanced liver disease, has recurrent cholangitis, 4 patients have died from causes unrelated to the bile duct cysts, and 2 patients are lost to follow up.\nBile duct cysts in adults are rare. There is a preponderance in the female gender, and the most common type is the extrahepatic (choledochal) cyst. The leading symptoms are cholestasis and right upper quadrant pain. There is an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. In young patients the cysts should be entirely removed to prevent malignancy. Older persons are usually symptomless after complete removal of gallstones.","title":"[Bile duct cysts in adults].","pubmedId":"9312834"}
