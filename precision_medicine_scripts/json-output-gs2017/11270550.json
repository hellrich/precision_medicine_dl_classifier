MIB-1 SIs for meningiomas in the pediatric population have not been previously reported. Meningiomas tend to be more histologically aggressive and to recur more frequently in children, compared with adults. The objectives of this study were to determine whether MIB-1 SIs are correlated with pathological atypia and recurrence among pediatric meningiomas and to compare the MIB-1 SIs of pediatric meningiomas with those of adult meningiomas.\nMIB-1 SIs were assessed on paraffin-embedded sections of 14 pediatric meningiomas (patient age, 2-17 yr), 5 of which contained atypical or malignant features. For comparison with benign pediatric meningiomas, MIB-1 SIs were also assessed on paraffin-embedded sections of 14 adult meningiomas (patient age, 38-90 yr), none of which displayed atypical or malignant features or recurred within a 5-month median follow-up period.\nMIB-1 SIs of pediatric meningiomas ranged from 1.2 to 31.6% (median, 9.1%). Significant differences were observed between the MIB-1 SIs for tumors with atypical or malignant features (median, 12.3%; range, 7.0-31.6%) and those for tumors without atypia (median, 7.0%; range, 1.2-12.6%; P \u003d 0.045). There were six recurrences after gross total resection, during a 36.5-month median follow-up period. All five of the tumors with pathological atypia recurred; one tumor without atypia recurred. Significant differences were observed between MIB-1 SIs for nonrecurrent tumors (median, 6.6%; range, 1.2-12.2%) and those for recurrent tumors (median, 12.5%; range, 7.0-31.6%; P \u003d 0.012). The median MIB-1 SI for adult control specimens was 8.8% (range, 1.2-19.3%), which did not differ significantly from that for pediatric meningiomas without atypia (P \u003d 0.68).\nFor this cohort of pediatric meningiomas, pathological atypia and the tendency to recur were correlated with elevated MIB-1 SIs. The median MIB-1 SI for pediatric meningiomas without histological atypia did not differ significantly from that for adult meningiomas without atypia, suggesting that the more aggressive clinical features of meningiomas in children may be attributable to factors other than the rate of cellular proliferation.","title":"MIB-1 staining index of pediatric meningiomas.","pubmedId":"11270550"}
