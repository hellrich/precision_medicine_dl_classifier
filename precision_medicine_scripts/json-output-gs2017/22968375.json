The treatment of CCA is challenging as the tumor is usually diagnosed late and the treatments are not very effective except when complete surgical resection is possible. In carefully selected patients, liver transplant can be a curative therapy. In the majority of cases, complete surgical resection is not possible and palliation is the mainstay of treatment. Stenting, using plastic or metallic stents, allows for biliary drainage. Photodynamic therapy plays a role in palliation and might play a role in adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. While radiation and chemotherapy can be beneficial, newer ablative techniques and targeted chemotherapies are promising.","title":"Cholangiocarcinoma treatment.","pubmedId":"22968375"}
