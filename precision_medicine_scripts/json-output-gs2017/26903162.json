The expressions of MAGE-C2 mRNA and MAGE-C2 protein were closely associated with clinical stage, metastasis and differentiation (P\u003c0.05). The expression rate of MAGE-C2 mRNA had no relationship with gender, age, smoking (P\u003e0.05). The expression of MAGE-C2 had an adverse effect on overall survival rate (P\u003c0.05).\nOver-expression of the MAGE-C2 mRNA and protein is existed in lung adenocarcinoma. The high expression of MAGE-C2 may be closely related to the occurrence and development in lung adenocarcinoma. MAGE-C2 may predict a poor prognosis and could be as a novel lung adenocarcinoma molecule marker.\u2029.\n背景与目的 本研究旨在探讨黑色素抗原C2（melanoma antigen-C2, MAGE-C2）在肺腺癌组织及癌旁组织中的表达，及其在肺癌诊断及预后方面的临床指导意义。方法 利用荧光定量PCR和Western blot方法检测MAGE-C2 mRNA和MAGE-C2蛋白在87例肺腺癌患者的癌组织及癌旁组织中的表达。结果 肺腺癌组织中MAGE-C2 mRNA及MAGE-C2蛋白存在高表达（53/87, 60.9%），而癌旁组织中无MAGE-C2 mRNA和MAGE-C2蛋白的表达；统计学分析后发现，MAGE-C2的表达情况与年龄、性别、吸烟史无明显相关性（P\u003e0.05），而与肿瘤分期、是否转移及分化程度相关（P\u003c0.05）；MAGE-C2高表达对患者总生存率有不利的影响（P\u003c0.05）。结论 MAGE-C2在肺腺癌组织中存在高表达，并与肿瘤分期及是否转移存在相关性，有望成为一种新型的肺腺癌诊断、治疗及预后标志物。.","title":"[Expression and Clinical Significance of MAGE-C2 in Lung Adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"26903162"}
