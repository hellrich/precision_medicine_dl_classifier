Lung cancer patients with drug-sensitive EGFR mutations initially respond, but acquire resistance after approximately one year of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. This review summarizes EGFR gene mutation profiles for East Asian non-small-cell lung cancer patients according to recent publications. Strategies for the treatment of acquired resistance mediated by EGFR T790M are also reviewed.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-guided treatment for lung cancers: Where are we now?","pubmedId":"27755839"}
