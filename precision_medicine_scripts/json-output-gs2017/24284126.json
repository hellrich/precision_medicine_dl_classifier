PDT was performed with 630 nm laser light (Diomed) delivered through cylinder diffusing tip quartz fibers that was passed through the biopsy channel of a flexible endoscope 48 h after intravenous injection of the photosensitizer photofrin (2mg/kg body weight). 72 h after the first irradiation, the endoscopic procedure was repeated, necrotic tissues were mechanically removed and the deep original lesions and newly exposed cancer lesions were re-treated, and, if necessary, the areas were cleaned repeatedly.\nThe total response rate CR+PR was 86.7%, and the mean percentage of obstruction due to tumors at different treated sites decreased from 90% to 16.7% at discharge after PDT. The KPS score was significantly improved after PDT.\nPDT of intractable bronchial lung cancer effectively reduces the amount of lumen obstruction, and improves the patient\u0027s quality of life. It may be an effective palliative treatment with minor side effects on patients with advanced bronchial lung cancer.","title":"Photodynamic therapy for intractable bronchial lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24284126"}
