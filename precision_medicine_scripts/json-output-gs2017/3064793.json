The etiology can be viral, drug-, or other chemical-induced, metabolic, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation emerged during the 1980s as a powerful means for dealing with these diseases. The existence of this therapeutic modality has brought about major changes in the diagnosis, patient selection, treatment, and outlook for fulminant/subacute liver failure. The authors present the results of orthotopic liver transplantation for the treatment of 47 cases of acute/subacute hepatic insufficiency at the University of Pittsburgh between March 1980 and July 1987. The results of this series demonstrate that liver transplantation is the most effective means for treating this condition.","title":"Orthotopic liver transplantation for fulminant and subacute hepatic failure.","pubmedId":"3064793"}
