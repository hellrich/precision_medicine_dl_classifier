This retrospective observational study describes the clinical utility of NGS panels in a single community cancer center. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients seen at a single community cancer center whose tumors were tested with NGS for actionable mutations. Under IRB approval, data were collected on date of testing, stage at testing, mutational results, type of cancer, treatment decisions and survival. A total of 58 NGS panels were ordered in patients with advanced cancer after failure of standard therapy between March 2014 and September 2015. Results: The most common actionable mutations found were KRAS and TP53. Of the 58 NGS panels, 52 (90%) had sufficient tumor tissue for NGS. At least one mutation was identified in 39 pts (75%). Forty-four of the 52 patients (85%) were not involved in clinical trials or started on targeted therapy. Fifteen of the 44 patients (35%) had no mutations identified or non-actionable mutations; 29 of the 44 patients (65%) had actionable mutations. Eight of the 52 patients (15%) were enrolled to at least one targeted agent that matched their mutation or onto clinical trials that matched their genetic alterations. Conclusions: Although a majority of patients with advanced cancers whose tumors underwent NGS profiling demonstrated genetic alterations, only 15% were enrolled to a matched trial or a targeted therapy. This low impact of NGS testing on treatment decisions could be due to lack of guidelines on interpretation of results of NGS diagnostic tests. Randomized clinical trials and/or genomic databases are needed to guide physicians in the community practice setting on how to best utilize NGS results.
