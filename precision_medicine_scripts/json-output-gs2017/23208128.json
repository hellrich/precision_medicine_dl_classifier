Biases in disease stage, treatment regimen, small-scale patient studies, and biomarker status have led to inconsistent results in previous reports.\nThe KRAS and EGFR genes were examined in 1935 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer. All patients were divided into KRAS mutation (KRAS group), EGFR mutation (EGFR group), and KRAS/EGFR wild type (WT group) groups. Randomly selected cases were paired with patients with the KRAS mutation, the EGFR mutation, and KRAS/EGFR wild type patients according to tumor, node, metastasis stage, time of first visit within 1 year, and pathology. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox models.\nThe KRAS mutation rate for lung adenocarcinoma was 5.90 %. The overall survival was 14.47, 20.57, and 42.73 months for the KRAS group, WT group, and EGFR group, respectively (P \u003c 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that KRAS mutation status was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio 2.69, 95 % confidence interval 1.91-3.80, P \u003c 0.001). No difference was found in PFS and tumor responsiveness between patients with a KRAS mutation and those with wild type KRAS/EGFR for chemotherapy and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). PFS did not significantly differ for chemotherapy among the three groups (P \u003d 0.270).\nKRAS mutation is a poor prognosis factor, but it is not an independent predictor of response to EGFR-TKI or chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer.","title":"KRAS mutation in patients with lung cancer: a predictor for poor prognosis but not for EGFR-TKIs or chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"23208128"}
