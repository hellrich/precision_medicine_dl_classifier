This amplification occurs in approximately 15% of primary breast cancers. Several candidate oncogenes map within the amplicon but by analysing expression of these genes a strong case can be made for a role for cyclin D1 in tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical staining indicates that cyclin D1 is expressed at elevated levels in around 40% of breast cancers, including those with the 11q13 amplification. The potential function of cyclin D1 as a regulator of early cell division cycle events would be consistent with a role in neoplasia.","title":"Amplification of chromosome band 11q13 and a role for cyclin D1 in human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"7720042"}
