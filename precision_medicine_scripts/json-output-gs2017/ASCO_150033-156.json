ALK break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay, Ventana immunohistochemistry (IHC), and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can all be used as the primary assay for detecting ALK fusion events in tumor samples of lung cancer patients with SFDA approval in China. The objective of this study was to analyze the association of ALK rearrangements with clinical outcomes in different ALK testing methods, including FISH, Ventana IHC, and RT-PCR. Methods:  ALK status was assessed by FISH, IHC and RT-PCR in 75 patients with advanced ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma who had received crizotinib treatment from 2011,May to 2014, Nov in China. Clinicopathologic data and survival outcomes were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability was used to assess different testing methods for survival.  Results:  Of all 75 ALK-potitive lung adonocarcinoma, there are 23 FISH-positive ALK patients (23/75, 30.7%), 35 IHC-positive ALK patients (35/75, 46.7%) and 17 RT-PCR-positive ALK patients (17/75, 22.7%). 75 patients received crizotinib treatment with IHC-positive and FISH-positive had better progression-free survival (PFS) (P\u003d 0.049), compared with those with RT-PCR-positive, but not for overall survival (OS)  (P\u003d 0.074). The median PFS survival for all these 75 patients was 16m, 14m, 8m, separately based on the IHC, FISH, and RT-PCR test. 23 patients received first-line crizotinib treatment with IHC-positive and FISH-positive had better PFS (P\u003d 0.030), compared with those with RT-PCR-positive, but not for OS (P\u003d 0.061), either. The median PFS survival for these 23 patients with first-line crizotinib treatment was 12m, 18m, 4.8m, separately based on the IHC, FISH, and RT-PCR test.  Conclusions:  The conventional IHC assay is a valuable tool and efficient technique for diagnosing ALK rearrangements in clinical practice. While RT-PCR is need to be further evaluated in clinical practice to identify its role in guiding patients\u0027 targeted therapy using crizotinib.","title":"A survival comparison study of Chinese patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma harboring ALK rearrangements with crizotinib treatment detected by FISH, IHC, and RT-PCR.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150033-156"}
