Additionally, the relationships among frequency of self-examination, clinical examination, perceived risk, fear of breast cancer, and frequency of talking with their mothers about breast cancer were assessed.\nA retrospective, correlational descriptive design was used. Questionnaires were mailed to members of a breast cancer support group and to women diagnosed with breast cancer in one medical oncology practice. These women were asked to mail the questionnaires to their adult daughters.\nThere was a significant relationship between frequency of BSE and frequency of talking with mothers about breast cancer. Frequency of self-examination was related inversely to fear of breast cancer. Fear of breast cancer appears to act as a barrier to action whereas frequency of talking with their mothers about breast cancer seems to act as a cue to action in support of the Health Belief Model.\nHealthcare providers should make every effort to optimize the practice of BSE in daughters of women with breast cancer. Only 52% reported performing BSE monthly, with the remaining 48% performing BSE less frequently or not at all. Thirty-one percent reported having no formal or printed instruction regarding BSE. Health professionals caring for women who have a family history of breast cancer should assess the educational needs of these women and provide opportunities for them to acquire and demonstrate skills. Periodic re-evaluation of BSE is needed to reinforce importance and demonstrate technique. The development of educational materials developed specifically for daughters of women with breast cancer may be useful in diminishing the perception of an unrealistically high risk of developing breast cancer. With the decrease in fear, which appears to be acting as a barrier to BSE in this group, better breast cancer detection practices in daughters may be realized. Counseling about realistic risk of developing breast cancer also may be useful in reducing the amount of fear of breast cancer in these women. This is an unnecessary burden for any woman to bear and may interfere with her optimal practice of breast cancer detection practices.","title":"Breast cancer detection by daughters of women with breast cancer.","pubmedId":"9250077"}
