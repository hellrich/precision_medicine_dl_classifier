PTEN plays a vital role in cell survival and proliferation by regulating Akt phosphorylation, a key component of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. Here we show that insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), which signals through PI3K, regulates PTEN expression in the mammary gland. IGF-II injection into mouse mammary gland significantly increased PTEN expression. Transgenic IGF-II expression also increased mammary PTEN protein, leading to reductions in Akt phosphorylation, epithelial proliferation, and mammary morphogenesis. IGF-II induced PTEN promoter activity and protein levels and this involved the immediate early gene egr-1. Thus, we have identified a novel negative feedback loop within the PI3K pathway where IGF-II induces PTEN expression to modulate its physiologic effects.","title":"Insulin-like growth factor-II regulates PTEN expression in the mammary gland.","pubmedId":"14517213"}
