Information utilized included outside medical records, imaging studies, pathology reports in which simultaneous mutation testing was performed, and clinic visit notes. In addition, we conducted a literature search of background information using the following search terms: \"BRAF mutations\", \"non-small cell lung cancer\", and \"driver mutations\". Several retrospective studies on BRAF mutations in patients with NSCLC found that the majority of these mutations occur in adenocarcinomas and are V600E mutations. From our patients and literature search, we found that BRAF-V600E mutations occur predominantly in female smokers with adenocarcinomas.
