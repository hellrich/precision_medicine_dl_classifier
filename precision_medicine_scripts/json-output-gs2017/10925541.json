The patient had a history of atypical meningioma and had undergone a craniotomy to remove a tumor nine years earlier. We discuss the distinctive morphologic, immunohistochemical staining and ultrastructural features of a recurrent malignant meningioma. A meningioma with rhabdoid transformation may indicate aggressive biologic and clinical behavior of the tumor.","title":"Malignant meningioma with rhabdoid transformation.","pubmedId":"10925541"}
