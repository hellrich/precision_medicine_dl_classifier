Patients with activating mutations of the EGFR generally respond to EGFR-TKI very well. HER3 has an essential role to enhance the EGFR signaling pathway, including the downstream pathway of PI3K/Akt pathway. The acquired resistance to EGFRTKI was clinically developed in patients with activating EGFR mutations. Recently, various mechanisms of acquired resistance have been developed, such as T790M, MET amplification, HGF increasing as a ligand of MET. We have to treat patients with NSCLC in the manor of individual medicine strategy today.","title":"[Overcoming resistance to EGFR-TKI in lung cancer].","pubmedId":"19381026"}
