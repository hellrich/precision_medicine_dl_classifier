The GNAS status in the IPMN tissue and 23 DF specimens was assessed by sensitive mutation scanning methods.\nThe GNAS mutation rate in IPMN with distinct PDAC was significantly lower than that in IPMN without PDAC (4/16, 25%, vs 61/94, 65%; P \u003d 0.0047). By multivariate analysis, GNAS wild-type and gastric type IPMNs were significantly associated with distinct PDAC. Of 45 GNAS wild-type IPMNs, 10 (43%) of 23 gastric type IPMNs had distinct PDAC, whereas only 2 (9%) of 22 non-gastric type IPMNs had distinct PDAC (P \u003d 0.017). The GNAS status in DF was consistent with that in tissue in 21 (91%) of 23 patients.\nDistinct PDACs frequently develop in the pancreas with gastric type IPMN without GNAS mutations. Duodenal fluid DNA test would predict the GNAS status of IPMN, whereas the detection of the gastric subtype using noninvasive test remains to be determined.","title":"Clinical significance of GNAS mutation in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas with concomitant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25479586"}
