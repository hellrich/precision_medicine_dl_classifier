We also sought to compare PSA doubling times from men with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy to a group treated with radiation therapy.\nDetailed followup was available for 150 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy from January 1993 to August 1995. PSA doubling time was calculated for all patients with 3 or more pre-radical prostatectomy PSA levels using linear regression. We assessed the association between PSA doubling time and PSA failure, pathologic stage at radical prostatectomy, final PSA before treatment and Gleason score. We compared our PSA doubling time values and distribution to a published series of patients with prostate cancer who had undergone radiation therapy.\nA total of 56 patients had 3 or more PSA values before treatment. Median followup was 17.3 months. PSA doubling time did not correlate with PSA failure, final PSA or Gleason score, but it did with pathological stage at radical prostatectomy (p \u003d 0.0035 for positive margins, p \u003d 0.025 for positive seminal vesicles). Our PSA doubling time and PSA failure rates did not differ from the radiation therapy population with similar followup times.\nAlthough studies from the radiation literature have shown PSA doubling time to be useful in predicting PSA failure after treatment for prostate cancer, our results do not confirm this finding. We did find a correlation with pathologic stage at radical prostatectomy, and so longer followup with more patients may confirm this in the future. We also found no significant differences in PSA doubling time between our patients and a group treated with radiation. At least for this parameter, patients with prostate cancer referred for radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy may be similar.","title":"Pretreatment prostate specific antigen doubling times: use in patients before radical prostatectomy.","pubmedId":"9334621"}
