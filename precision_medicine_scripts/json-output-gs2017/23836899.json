In this study, we investigate the relationship between mitochondrial alterations and PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling activation using hepatocytes and liver tissues as our experimental models. We show here that liver-specific deletion of Pten, which leads to activation of PI3K/AKT, is associated with elevated oxidative stress, increased mitochondrial mass, and augmented respiration accompanied by enhanced glycolysis. Consistent with these observations, estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), an orphan nuclear receptor known for its role in mitochondrial biogenesis, is up-regulated in the absence of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN). Our pharmacological and genetic studies show that PI3K/AKT activity regulates the expression of ERRα and mitochondrial biogenesis/respiration. Furthermore, cAMP-response element-binding protein, as a downstream target of AKT, plays a role in the regulation of ERRα, independent of PKA signaling. ERRα regulates reactive oxygen species production, and ERRα knockdown attenuates proliferation and colony-forming potential in Pten-null hepatocytes. Finally, analysis of clinical datasets from liver tissues showed a negative correlation between expressions of ERRα and PTEN in patients with liver cancer. Therefore, this study has established a previously unrecognized link between a growth signal and mitochondrial metabolism.
