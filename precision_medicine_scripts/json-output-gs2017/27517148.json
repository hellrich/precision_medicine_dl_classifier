KRAS mutation is detected in 30-40% of patients with A-AC, but its clinical implication and prognostic value are not well described. We conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the association between KRAS mutation and prognosis in patients with A-AC. We searched Pubmed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases for articles including following terms in their titles, abstracts, or keywords: \u0027ampullary or periampullary or ampulla of vater\u0027, \u0027cancer or carcinoma\u0027, and \u0027KRAS\u0027. There were five studies with survival data of patients. A total of 388 patients with A-AC from the 5 studies were included in the overall survival (OS) analysis, and 169 patients from 2 studies were eligible for the relapse-free-survival (RFS) analysis. Out of 388 patients, 175 (45%) had KRAS mutation. There was no association between KRAS mutation and OS (HR \u003d 1.06, 95% CI: 0.87-1.29, P \u003d 0.58). However, there was a significant correlation between KRAS mutation and worse RFS (HR \u003d 2.74, 95% CI: 1.52-4.92, P \u003d 0.0008). In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicates that KRAS mutation is associated with poor RFS, but not with OS in patients with A-AC.","title":"KRAS mutation as a prognostic factor in ampullary adenocarcinoma: a meta-analysis and review.","pubmedId":"27517148"}
