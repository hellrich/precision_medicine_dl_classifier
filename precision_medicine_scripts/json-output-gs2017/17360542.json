Targeting of oncogenic Kras to such a restricted cell compartment was sufficient for the formation of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), putative precursors to PDAC. PanINs appeared with the same grade and frequency as observed when Kras(G12D) was targeted to the whole pancreas by a Pdx1-driven Cre recombinase strategy. Thus, the Nestin cell lineage is highly responsive to Kras oncogenic activation and may represent the elusive progenitor population in which PDAC arises.","title":"The Nestin progenitor lineage is the compartment of origin for pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia.","pubmedId":"17360542"}
