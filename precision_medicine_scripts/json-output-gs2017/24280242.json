Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The χ(2) test was used to estimate the relationship between the variables.\nA total of 2161 patients were diagnosed with LC, 396 (18.3%) of whom had never smoked. The mean age (±standard deviation) in this group was 72.85±10.52; 64.6% were women and 35.4% men. According to the cytohistology, 55.6% were adenocarcinoma, 20.5% squamous cell, 15% small cell, 2.7% large cell and 6.2% other subtypes. The diagnosis was made in advanced stage (iv) in 61.4%, and 14.4% of the patients received surgical treatment. Survival was 12.4%, with no differences between the two groups. In the group of never smokers, women had better survival than men.\nOf the patients diagnosed with LC, 18.3% had never smoked. It was diagnosed mainly in women, at advanced stages and the most common histological type was adenocarcinoma. There were no survival differences compared to the group of smokers.","title":"Clinical characteristics and survival in never smokers with lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24280242"}
