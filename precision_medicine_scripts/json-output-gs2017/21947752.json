We recently reported a BRCA2 c.9004G\u003eA variant of unknown clinical significance in two French Canadian breast cancer families. It confers a E3002K alteration in the conserved C-terminus domain of BRCA2, and has been reported in non-French Canadian cancer families. Seven variant positive French Canadian families have since been identified by mutation screening of referrals to hereditary cancer clinics. In this article, we describe the cancer phenotypes of these families and further assess the contribution of this variant in the French Canadian population. We screened index breast cancer cases from 58 cancer families with at least three confirmed cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer and 960 breast cancer cases (48 years mean age) not selected for family history of cancer that were previously found not to carry the most common BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations reported in this population. The index variant-positive cases from each family had breast cancer between the ages of 35-55 years (43 years mean age); and reported close relatives with breast cancer diagnoses between the ages of 28-84 years (57 years mean age). Three families had ovarian or peritoneal cancers. BRCA2-associated cancers, such as bladder, esophagus, pancreas, prostate, and thyroid cancers also occurred in these families. One c.9004G\u003eA carrier also harbored the PALB2 c.2323C\u003eT (Q775X) mutation found to recur in French Canadian breast cancer cases. No new BRCA2 variant carriers were identified in mutation screens. The absence of BRCA2 c.9004G\u003eA carriers in the breast cancer cases not selected for family history contrasts with familial cases, supporting a pathogenic status for this variant and addition to the existing common BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-screening panel for French Canadian breast and/or ovarian cancer families.","title":"The BRCA2 c.9004G\u003eA (E2002K) [corrected] variant is likely pathogenic and recurs in breast and/or ovarian cancer families of French Canadian descent.","pubmedId":"21947752"}
