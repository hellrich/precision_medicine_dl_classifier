The first had previously undergone fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and the second subsequently was treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy after decompression surgery. After excision of a dural window and biopsy of the tumor from the nerve sheath, visual acuity improved to 20/25 and 20/200, respectively, both coinciding with resolution of disc edema.\nIn patients with optic nerve sheath meningioma with severe disc edema and rapid vision loss, surgery may serve an important but restricted, adjuvant role to radiation therapy under special conditions.","title":"Role for surgery as adjuvant therapy in optic nerve sheath meningioma.","pubmedId":"16855500"}
