An understanding of the contribution of kinases to cancer has emerged during the past two decades; however, our understanding of phosphatases in cancer has lagged behind. Currently, three phosphatases have been implicated in the etiology of tumors: protein phosphatase 2A, CDC25A/B, and PTEN (or MMAC1). Protein phosphatase 2A and PTEN behave as tumor suppressors, whereas CDC25A and -B act as oncogenes.","title":"Phosphatases and tumorigenesis.","pubmedId":"9466490"}
