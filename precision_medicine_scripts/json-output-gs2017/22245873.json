Our aim was to determine the clinical and molecular phenotypes of colorectal carcinoma in kidney transplant recipients and compare with those in the nonimmunosuppressed population. For the first time, we analyzed the impact of KRAS and BRAF mutations in kidney transplantation.\nKidney transplant recipients with colorectal carcinoma were diagnosed and followed up from 1992 to 2007. Twelve patients fulfilled inclusion criteria and were matched with the general population with colorectal cancer. To assess the possible mechanisms involved in the clinical behavior of colorectal carcinoma, we compared the tumoral expression by immunohistochemical analysis of molecule markers of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, angiogenesis and proliferation, and the role of activating mutations in KRAS and BRAF genes.\nColorectal carcinoma was more prevalent and exhibited a trend for worse prognosis in transplant patients. Although the mTOR pathway was activated in both populations, activation was lower in transplant patients because of relatively higher phosphatase and tensin homolog expression in the former. Angiogenesis was activated in colorectal carcinoma in both groups. KRAS mutations were found in transplant recipients treated with calcineurin inhibitors and with high expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog.\nThe activation of oncogenic pathways could be responsible for the clinical behavior of posttransplant colorectal carcinoma. The mutation status of the KRAS gene is likely involved in mTOR pathway and to be a prognosis marker for colorectal cancer in kidney transplantation.","title":"Role of oncogenic pathways and KRAS/BRAF mutations in the behavior of colon adenocarcinoma in renal transplant patients.","pubmedId":"22245873"}
