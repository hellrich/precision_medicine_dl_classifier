Meanwhile, MTT assay was used to determine the sensitivity of both kinds of cells to 6 chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin, paclitaxel, harringtonine, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, and aclacimomycin, and the inhibitory rate of cells under the irradiation of 10 Gy ray was also measured.\nThe intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells were mostly fusiform in shape, and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells were mostly round or polygon in shape. Their doubling time was 26. 3 hours and 23. 1 hours, respectively. Their average number of chromosomes was 59 (range, 38-84) and 67 (range, 49-103), respectively. The chromosome karyotypes of most intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells were hyperdiploid and hypotriploid, while hypertriploid was predominant in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells. The level of CA 125 in supernatant of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells increased obviously, while levels of other determined tumor markers in both kinds of cells were all within normal range. The intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells were low sensitive to cisplatin and paclitaxel, but not sensitive to the other 4 chemotherapeutic drugs. The extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells were high sensitive to cisplatin, but not sensitive to the other 5 drugs. Both kinds of cells had poor sensitivity to radiotherapy.\nIntrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells show differences in shape, doubling time, chromosome karyotype, tumor marker level, and chemosensitivity, whereas they both have poor radiosensitivity. Though they are similar in histopathology, they have different growth characteristics and have discrepancy in treatment and prognosis.","title":"Difference in biological characteristics and sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy between intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro.","pubmedId":"18437912"}
