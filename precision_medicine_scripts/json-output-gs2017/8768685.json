While lifestyle practices such as pork and alcohol consumption and a familial trend have been linked to pancreatic cancer, cigarette smoking is the only established risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Therefore, a retrospective, descriptive study was conducted to explore lifestyle risk factors and the familial trend in pancreatic cancer. The Familial Pancreatic Cancer Questionnaire (FPCQ) was used to collect data on demographics, tobacco and alcohol use, dietary history, and medical history. A surrogate respondent (family member) for 31 pancreatic cancer subjects completed the FPCQ. Race and gender specific incidence rates (IR) for pancreatic cancer in Acadiana were calculated. Results showed that mean IRs for pancreatic cancer for Caucasian and African-American males and females were higher than national SEER rates. Pancreatic cancer and lung cancer were the most frequently reported cancers among subjects\u0027 first degree relatives. The majority (65%) of the subjects smoked. A positive family history for pancreatic cancer was found in this study with five (16%) of the pancreatic cancer subjects having one or more first degree relatives with pancreatic cancer. This percent is twice that found by previous researchers.","title":"Familial pancreatic cancer in south Louisiana.","pubmedId":"8768685"}
