Smoking is by far the most important cause but familial factors also contribute. The symptoms of lung cancer are often subtle and the diagnosis, in about 70% of cases, is made when metastases have occurred. Curative surgical treatment is therefore only possible in about a third of the cases whereas other patients receive chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In recent years some important advances have been made in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer. New imaging techniques have improved diagnosis and staging practices and consequently also treatment. Recent evidence suggests that screening with low dose CT may improve survival. New approaches to chemotherapy have been shown to improve survival and well being of patients with advanced disease. Chemotherapeutic agents are now being used in conjunction with surgery to reduce the risk of tumour spread. Furthermore, advances in surgical techniques have made resections possible in cases deemed inoperable in the past. In this review we present important advances in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer as reflected by recent literature that should be of interest to a wide variety of specialists.","title":"[Lung cancer--review].","pubmedId":"18460729"}
