The combination of the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) remains the reference treatment. However, the advantage of infusional 5-FU/LV with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant treatment may change the paradigm soon. Capecitabine may be considered as an alternative to 5-FU/LV in the adjuvant therapy of stage III colon cancer. The clinical benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for localized node negative (stage II) disease is definite but small, even though there is yet no universal consensus. Novel molecular and biologic-oriented agents are being studied. Further analysis and definition of prognostic and predictive markers may allow future adjuvant therapy to be individualized.","title":"Adjuvant therapy of colon cancer.","pubmedId":"15726511"}
