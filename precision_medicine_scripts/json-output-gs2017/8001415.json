There were 14 cases to occur amplification of C-erbB2 oncogene in 50 cases with ovarian cancer. Among 14 ovarian cancer cases with amplification of C-erbB2, 2 of 20 cases were detected in stage I and II respectively, while 12 of 30 cases were from stage III/IV (P \u003c 0.05). These results showed that amplification of C-erbB2 proto-oncogene is associated with advanced ovarian cancer. Therefore, it is suggested that C-erbB2 gene amplification may deserve further evaluation as a prognostic marker in ovarian cancer.","title":"[Amplification of C-erB2 gene in ovarian cancer].","pubmedId":"8001415"}
