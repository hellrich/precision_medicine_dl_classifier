All patients with lung cancer should be considered surgical candidates until they are proven to have contraindications to resection. This article reviews preoperative assessment and the operative technique for the surgical treatment of lung cancer. As with other surgical specialties, thoracic surgery is moving towards minimally invasive techniques that are reducing morbidity, mortality, and length of stay.
