In this study, we compare anti-C1q IgG with another complement autoantibody, anti-C3b IgG, as a biomarker of lupus nephritis and lupus nephritis flare.\nOur investigation involved the Ohio SLE Study, a prospective observational cohort of patients with recurrently active lupus who were followed bimonthly. Serum anti-C1q and anti-C3b IgG levels were assessed cross-sectionally by ELISA in 40 normal controls and 114 patients in the Ohio SLE Study (41 nonrenal and 73 lupus nephritis) at study entry, and longitudinally in a subset of patients in the Ohio SLE Study with anti-C1q-positive lupus nephritis in samples collected every 2 months for 8 months leading up to lupus nephritis flare (n\u003d16 patients).\nIn the cross-sectional analysis, compared with anti-C1q IgG, anti-C3b IgG was less sensitive (36% versus 63%) but more specific (98% versus 71%) for lupus nephritis. Only anti-C3b IgG was associated with patients with lupus nephritis who experienced at least one lupus nephritis flare during the Ohio SLE Study period (P\u003c0.01). In the longitudinal analysis, circulating levels of anti-C1q IgG increased at the time of lupus nephritis flare only in patients who were anti-C3b positive (P\u003d0.02), with significant increases occurring from 6 (38% increase) and 4 months (41% increase) before flare. Anti-C3b IgG levels also trended up at lupus nephritis flare, although the change did not reach statistical significance (P\u003d0.07). Neither autoantibody increased 2 months before flare.\nAlthough not as prevalent as anti-C1q IgG, anti-C3b IgG showed nearly complete specificity for lupus nephritis. The presence of anti-C3b IgG identified patients with lupus nephritis who were prone to flare and in whom serial measurements of markers associated with complement, such as anti-C1q IgG, may be useful to monitor lupus nephritis activity.","title":"Relationship of Circulating Anti-C3b and Anti-C1q IgG to Lupus Nephritis and Its Flare.","pubmedId":"26700439"}
