ACA of the IgG isotype were found in 13 patients (\u003d 39.4%) with CDLE and ACA-IgM in 5 other cases (\u003d 15.2%); among the SCLE patients ACA-IgG was increased in 8 (\u003d 36.4%) and ACA-IgM in 1 other (\u003d 4.5%), while in 3 further patients (\u003d 13.6%) both ACA-IgG and IgM were detected. In total, ACA were found in 54.6% of the CDLE and in 54.5% of the SCLE patients. In SLE ACA-IgG alone was seen in 41.7% of the patients and ACA of both isotypes in another 33.3%. The serum levels of ACA were higher in SLE than in the cutaneous LE subsets. No correlation with the presence of ANA and binding capacity was detected in any of these groups. Vascular symptoms were seen in 19 of 39 patients with detectable ACA (\u003d 48.7%), whereas only 9 of 27 ACA-negative patients (\u003d 33.3%) were found to have vascular symptoms on clinical examination. Only 1 of the patients with isolated ACA-IgM elevation (5 CDLE patients, 1 SCLE patient) had vascular symptoms. The detection of circulating ACA is a non-specific but rather sensitive marker for cutaneous LE. In particular, the ACA-IgG isotype shows a statistical correlation with the presence of vascular symptoms and is useful as a complement to the immune serological tests for the diagnosis of LE.","title":"[Anticardiolipin antibodies in cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
