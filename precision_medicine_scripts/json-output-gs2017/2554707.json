It is unlikely that significant reductions in the incidence and mortality associated with lung cancer will be realized without effective antismoking campaigns. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy all play a role in the management of lung cancer. At the current time, NSCLC is generally curable only if it is diagnosed while the tumor is small and localized and can be surgically removed. Radiation therapy may also be effective in localized cases. Combination chemotherapy regimens have not consistently produced quality responses in patients with advanced tumors; however, newer regimens utilizing high doses of cisplatin, mitomycin and vinca alkaloids, or cisplatin and etoposide have produced encouraging results. In contrast to NSCLC, SCLC is responsive to combination chemotherapy regimens. Although many different agents are effective in this disease, most small-cell tumors eventually become refractory to chemotherapy and most patients do not survive longer than two years. Although progress has been made in the understanding and management of lung cancer, effective therapies that consistently produce major and durable responses are still lacking. Clinical trials must continue to evaluate therapeutic modalities for all types of lung cancer.","title":"Lung cancer: detection, prevention, and therapeutics.","pubmedId":"2554707"}
