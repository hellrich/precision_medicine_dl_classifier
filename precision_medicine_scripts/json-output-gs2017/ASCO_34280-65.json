However, little is known about patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in this patient population. The aims of this study were to explore the prognostic values of baseline HRQOL for time-to-treatment failure (TTF), as well as the predictors of repeatedly measured posttreatment HRQOL, in advanced NSCLC patients receiving first-line gefitinib. Methods: A total of 106 chemonaive patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled in a phase II trial. Gefitinib was given at a dose of 250 mg/d. HRQOL was assessed monthly with the EuroQoL instrument (EQ-5D) and the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) questionnaire. Baseline HRQOL and clinical/molecular predictors of TTF were jointly examined by multiple Cox\u0027s proportional hazards model. The associations between the clinical/molecular factors and repeatedly measured posttreatment HRQOL were analyzed by fitting marginal linear regression model using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method. Results: In this prospective study, HRQOL data were obtained from 94 patients. Baseline EQ-5D index (estimated hazard ratio \u003d 0.286, 95% C.I.: 0.135-0.603, p \u003d 0.001) and the presence of L858R EGFR mutation in adenocarcinoma (estimated hazard ratio \u003d 0.520, 95% C.I.: 0.307-0.880, p \u003d 0.015) were retained as independent prognostic factors in the final multiple Cox\u0027s proportional hazards model for TTF. According to preliminary GEE analysis of repeatedly measured posttreatment HRQOL, the patients with wild-type EGFR consistently had worse HRQOL in EQ-5D index (p \u003c 0.0001), EQ-5D VAS score (p \u003d 0.0002), and LCSS global score (p \u003c 0.0001), respectively. Conclusions: In advanced NSCLC patients receiving first-line gefitinib, better baseline EQ-5D index and L858R EGFR mutation in adenocarcinoma predict longer TTF. In addition, patients with wild-type EGFR had worse posttreatment HRQOL.","title":"Quality of life in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving first-line gefitinib monotherapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_34280-65"}
