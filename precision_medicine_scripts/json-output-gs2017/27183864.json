This translocation occurs in 5% of lung adenocarcinoma and has been demonstrated to be useful as a therapeutic target for crizotinib. sinonasal adenocarcinomas (SNAC) are histologically similar to lung adenocarcinomas; the aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of ALK alterations in SNAC.\nBreak-apart fluorescent in-situ hybridization was used to analyse the presence of ALK translocations in 96 tumour samples. In addition, ALK protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry.\nThe samples of SNAC did not show ALK translocation. Moreover, ALK protein expression was absent in all cases.\nThese results suggest that ALK is not involved in SNAC.","title":"Absence of chromosomal translocations and protein expression of ALK in sinonasal adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"27183864"}
