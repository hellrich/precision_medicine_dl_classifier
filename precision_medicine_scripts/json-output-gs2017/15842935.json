Of 84 cases, 72 case were breast cancer. Statistic analysis BCSG1 gene expression correlation with clinical parameters of breast cancer. 72 breast cancers were followed up (4 - 43 months) to set up independent prognosis factor by survival analysis.\nBCSG1 was undetectable in all benign breast lesions, while was detectable in 36.1% of all breast cancer samples (26/72), in which 79.2% of stage III/IV cases were positive (19/24). The expression of BCSG1 was tightly correlated with the stage (P \u003d 0.000) and the size of tumor (P \u003d 0.007). Both ER (P \u003d 0.027) and BCSG1 (P \u003d 0.001) were the independent prognosis factor of breast cancer.\nBCSG1 is one of independent tumor marker of breast cancer, the expression of BCSG1 is closely correlated to the stage of breast cancer and the tumor size. Maybe, BCSG1 is a new prognosis factor of breast cancer.","title":"[The effect of breast cancer specific gene 1 in the prognosis of breast cancer].","pubmedId":"15842935"}
