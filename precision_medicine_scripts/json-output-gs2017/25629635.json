These included nine adenocarcinoma in situ, nine minimal invasive adenocarcinoma, and 54 invasive adenocarcinoma. Among them, 33 tumor lesions (45.8 %) were found harboring EGFR mutations: 13 tumors with exon 19 deletion, 18 with L858R on exon 21, and two with both exon 19 del and L858R mutation. There were 5 tumors (6.9 %) harboring EML4-ALK fusion, four HER2 mutations (5.6%), three KRAS mutations (4.2%), one ROS1 fusion and one BRAF mutation. When we used the matched tumors to determine the intertumor discrepancy, only six out of 30 patients harbored identical mutations. The discordance rate of driver mutations was 80% (24 of 30) in those patients harboring at least one of the detected driver mutations. The median disease-free survival was 41.2 months (95% confidence interval: 35.8-52.6 months) and the median overall survival was \"still not reached\" in this cohort.\nWe found a high discrepancy of driver mutations among NSCLC patients with GGNs and a favorable prognosis after multiple lesions resection, which support surgical resection in this situation as a reasonable approach.","title":"High Discrepancy of Driver Mutations in Patients with NSCLC and Synchronous Multiple Lung Ground-Glass Nodules.","pubmedId":"25629635"}
