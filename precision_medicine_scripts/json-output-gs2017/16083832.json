However, few chemotherapeutic agents are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. New therapeutic approaches in PCNSL are based on: the treatment of systemic non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphomas with monoclonal antibodies and intensive chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell rescue, new chemotherapeutic agents with central nervous system penetration, or blood-brain barrier disruption to enhance drug delivery to the brain. This article discusses the rationale and results of these innovative approaches.","title":"New treatment approaches in primary central nervous system lymphoma.","pubmedId":"16083832"}
