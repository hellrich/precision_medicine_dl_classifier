Data regarding systemic therapy for recurrent high-grade meningioma are sparse. A retrospective case series of patients with recurrent WHO grade 2/3 meningioma treated with IFN-α following progression after surgery, radiotherapy and hydroxyurea was carried out, with the primary study objective of overall response rate, and median and 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).\n35 patients (28 women and 17 men; median age 63 years; range: 36-86 years) with recurrent high-grade meningioma (WHO grade 2 [n \u003d 22] or 3 [n \u003d 13]) were treated with IFN-α (10 million units/m(2)) subcutaneously every 2 days; one cycle was operationally defined as 4 weeks of IFN-α. Patients had progressed radiographically after prior therapy with surgery (35 out of 35), radiotherapy (35 out of 35; external-beam radiotherapy: 35 out of 35; and stereotactic radiotherapy: 34 out of 35) and hydroxyurea chemotherapy (35 out of 35). One patient was also treated with a somatostatin analog before initiating IFN-α treatment.\nPatients received one to 13 cycles (median: three) of IFN-α with moderate toxicity (100% of patients manifested grades 1-3 toxicity, of which only 20% were grade 3). There were no radiographic responses, 63% of patients had stable disease and 37% manifested progressive disease at first evaluation. PFS was 17% at 6 months (95% CI: 0.07-0.31; median PFS: 12 weeks; 95% CI: 8-20 weeks; range: 4-52 weeks). Following progression on IFN-α, the majority of patients (60%) were subsequently treated on an alternative therapy.\nIn this large retrospective series, IFN-α was moderately toxic, but appeared to have limited activity in patients with recurrent high-grade meningiomas.","title":"IFN-α for recurrent surgery- and radiation-refractory high-grade meningioma: a retrospective case series.","pubmedId":"25054463"}
