Patients with positive lower esophageal pH test were significantly older (50 ± 13 vs 45 ± 13 years, P \u003c 0.005) and had higher prevalence of acid regurgitation symptoms than patients with negative test (56/87 vs 72/149, P \u003c 0.05). Patients with positive upper esophageal pH test (n \u003d 67) also had significantly higher prevalence of acid regurgitation symptoms (43/67 vs 74/152, P \u003c 0.05). Prevalence of other upper gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms were similar between patients with positive and negative upper and lower pH test. Patients with abnormal EM were significantly older (49 ± 14 vs 45 ± 13 years, P \u003c 0.05) and had higher prevalence of chronic cough than patients with normal EM(30/93 vs 26/143, P \u003c 0.05). In patients with positive pH tests, the prevalence of dysphagia, chronic cough, and hoarseness of voice were significantly higher in patients with abnormal than those with normal EM (18/31 vs 18/56, P \u003c 0.05; 12/31 vs 6/56, P \u003c 0.005 and 19/31 vs 18/56, P \u003c 0.01, respectively). Whereas in patients with negative lower pH tests, only the prevalence of heartburn was significantly lower in patients with normal than those with abnormal EM (26/87 vs 30/62, P \u003c 0.05).\nAcid regurgitation but not heartburn was associated with GER. Esophageal dysmotility had no significant effect on acid regurgitation symptom but associated with chronic cough, hoarseness of voice, and dysphagia only in patients with abnormal esophageal acid exposure.","title":"Gastroesophageal reflux symptoms in typical and atypical GERD: roles of gastroesophageal acid refluxes and esophageal motility.","pubmedId":"23926926"}
