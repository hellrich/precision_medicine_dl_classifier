The average age of patients with a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma that occurs as a complication of hepatolithiasis is about 62-year-old. Here, the authors present a case of cholangiocarcinoma that occurred in a 24-year-old woman who presented with the recurrent cholangitis from hepatolithiasis. Left hepatectomy with hepaticojejunostomy was performed because she had multiple stones in an atrophic left lobe of the liver. Histopathological examination revealed that it was cholangiocarcinoma located in the inflammatory left hepatic duct.","title":"Cholangiocarcinoma in a 24-year-old woman with hepatolithiasis.","pubmedId":"19626820"}
