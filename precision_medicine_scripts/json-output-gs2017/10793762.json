From January 1992 to December 1998, 238 patients were operated on for pancreatic and periampullary masses. Fifty-five patients had PNDAN: 24 endocrine tumors, 7 serous cystadenomas, 6 intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors, 5 acinar carcinomas, 4 mucinous cystadenomas, 3 metastatic tumors, 2 cystic papillary tumors, 2 solid cystadenocarcinomas, 1 neurilemmoma, and 1 pancreatoblastoma; 19 were benign and 36 were malignant or borderline tumors. A correct preoperative diagnosis was obtained in 58% of the cases. In all other cases, diagnosis was achieved intraoperatively. Major (18 pancreaticoduodenectomies, 17 left splenopancreatectomies, 1 total pancreatectomy) and minor resections (5 central pancreatectomy, 10 enucleations) were performed; curative surgical operations were carried out on 39/55 patients (curative resectability: 71%). Operative mortality and morbidity were 1.8% and 21.8%, respectively. Three and 5-year actuarial survival for malignant or borderline PNDANs are 65% and 40% versus 31% (3-year) for ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreatic head treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy (p-value \u003d 0.03). We believe that pancreatic masses that are not ductal adenocarcinomas, can be aggressively resected even if large in size, resulting in a better outcome than ductal adenocarcinoma itself.","title":"Non ductal-adenocarcinoma neoplasms of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"10793762"}
