Here, we report that concurrent RAS pathway and TP53 mutations are identified in a subset of AML patients and confer an inferior overall survival. To further investigate the genetic interaction between p53 loss and endogenous NrasG12D/+ in AML, we generated conditional NrasG12D/+; p53-/- mice. Consistent with the clinical data, recipient mice transplanted with NrasG12D/+; p53-/- bone marrow cells rapidly develop a highly penetrant AML. We find that p53-/- cooperates with NrasG12D/+ to promote increased quiescence in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs). NrasG12D/+; p53-/- MEPs are transformed to self-renewing AML initiating cells and are capable of inducing AML in serially transplanted recipients. RNA-Seq analysis reveals that transformed MEPs gain partial HSC signature and largely retain MEP signature. Their distinct transcriptome suggests a potential regulation by p53 loss. In addition, we show that during AML development, transformed MEPs acquire overexpression of oncogenic Nras, leading to hyperactivation of ERK1/2 signaling. Our results demonstrate that p53-/- synergizes with enhanced oncogenic Nras signaling to transform MEPs and drive AML development. This model may serve as a platform to test candidate therapeutics in this aggressive subset of AML.","title":"p53-/- synergizes with enhanced NrasG12D signaling to transform megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors in acute myeloid leukemia.","pubmedId":"27815262"}
