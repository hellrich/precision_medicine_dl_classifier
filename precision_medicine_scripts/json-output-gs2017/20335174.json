Finding protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) that can specifically regulate the function of ErbB should help design novel therapies for treatment. By performing a small interfering RNA screen against 43 human PTPs, we find that knockdown of protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN9 significantly increases ErbB2 tyrosyl phosphorylation in the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line. In addition, knockdown of PTPN9 expression also enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of the ErbB1/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Conversely, increasing expression of PTPN9 wild type (WT) inhibits tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB2 and EGFR. To test whether ErbB2 and EGFR are substrates of PTPN9, PTPN9 WT, and a substrate trapping mutant (PTPN9 DA) are overexpressed in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Compared with vector control, expression of PTPN9 WT significantly inhibits whereas expression of PTPN9 DA dramatically enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB2 and EGFR, respectively. In contrast, expression of PTPN9 WT or DA mutant does not affect tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB3 and Shc. Importantly, coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pulldown experiments show that tyrosol-phosphorylated ErbB2 or EGFR is preferentially associated with PTPN9 DA compared with PTPN9 WT, indicating that ErbB2 and EGFR are substrates of PTPN9. Furthermore, PTPN9 WT expression specifically impairs EGF-induced STAT3 and STAT5 activation, and inhibits the cell growth in soft agar. Last, PTPN9 WT expression also reduces invasion and MMP2 expression of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data suggest PTPN9 as a negative regulator of breast cancer cells by targeting ErbB2 and EGFR and inhibiting STAT activation.","title":"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN9 negatively regulates ErbB2 and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in breast cancer cells.","pubmedId":"20335174"}
