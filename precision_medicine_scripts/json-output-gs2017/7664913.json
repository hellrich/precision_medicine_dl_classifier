The gastric lesions were diagnosed pre-operatively in one patient and at the time of examination of the resected specimen following pancreatoduodenectomy in the other. Specific problems in the diagnosis and management of these multiple primary carcinomas are discussed. Careful evaluation of the stomach prior to the surgical treatment for ampullary carcinoma is recommended.","title":"Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater synchronously associated with early gastric cancer--a report of two cases.","pubmedId":"7664913"}
