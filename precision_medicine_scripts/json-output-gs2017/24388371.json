A specific ALK inhibitor has been shown to exert anti-tumor effects in NSCLC with the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Previous reports suggested an EML4-ALK incidence of approximately 5% in a pan-NSCLC population, with an increased frequency in younger patients, but an appropriate strategy for further selecting patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene remains unknown.\nPatients, 55 years of age or younger, who were diagnosed with NSCLC without typical squamous cell carcinoma features at our institute were retrospectively evaluated. The tumor specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry for the EML4-ALK fusion gene and by polymerase chain reaction for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.\nBetween January 2004 and September 2011, the EML4-ALK fusion gene was detected in 19.6% (9/46) of patients. The fusion gene incidence increased to 31% (9/29) when patients with EGFR mutations were excluded. The EML4-ALK fusion gene was further detected in 2 cases of undifferentiated cell carcinoma.\nEML4-ALK fusion gene examinations could be more effectively performed by selecting young NSCLC patients without EGFR mutations, whereas selection on the basis of a non-smoking or adenocarcinoma history, as reported in previous studies, may not correctly identify the patient groups with potential EML4-ALK fusion gene.","title":"Effective enrichment strategy for EML4-ALK fusion gene screening in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24388371"}
