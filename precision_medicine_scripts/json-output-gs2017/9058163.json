A retrospective study was done to see if gastric remnant cancer is clinically different from primary gastric cancer without consideration of its etiology.\nThere are 77 patient with gastric remnant cancer diagnosed in our hospital in past 15 years. Thirty-two out of 77 patients underwent gastrectomy. Another 536 patients with primary gastric cancer and 73 patients with proximal third gastric cancer were used as the controls. The clinicopathological characteristics including gender, age, TNM tumor stage, Lauren\u0027s classification, degree of tumor cell differentiation, rate of curative resection and 5-year survival rate were analyzed to see if there is significant difference among the three groups.\nAlmost 90% of patients with gastric remnant cancer had a partial gastrectomy with Billroth II operation before and the median incubation interval was 24.5 years. Male predominance in gastric remnant cancer was shown in our series. However, the age distribution, TNM tumor stage, Lauren\u0027s classification, degree of tumor cell differentiation, rate of curative resection and 5-year survival after curative resection were no different among the three groups.\nThere was no difference in clinical behavior of resected gastric remnant cancer from other gastric carcinoma. Since most of the tumors were detected too late to be resected, early detection is the only way to increase the resection rate and improve the survival. Annual endoscopic surveillance after gastrectomy was recommended for early detection.","title":"Is gastric remnant cancer clinically different from primary gastric cancer?","pubmedId":"9058163"}
