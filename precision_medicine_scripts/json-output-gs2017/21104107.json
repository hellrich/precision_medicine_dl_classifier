Of the 74 patients tested for KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18), patients with KIT exon 9 mutant GIST (n \u003d 11, 14.9%) showed numerically better clinical benefit (objective response or stable disease â‰¥ 24 weeks) rate (63.6% vs 46.8%, p \u003d 0.504) and TTP (median 13.6 mo vs 6.9 mo, p \u003d 0.631) than those with KIT exon 11 mutant GIST (n \u003d 47, 63.5%). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events included neutropenia (34.1%), thrombocytopenia (33.0%) and hand-foot skin reaction (25.0%).\nSunitinib is an effective and safe second-line therapy for Korean patients with advanced GIST. The superior efficacy of sunitinib against GISTs with KIT exon 9 mutations appears to be similar in Korean patients to Western experience although statistical significance was not secured.","title":"Sunitinib as a second-line therapy for advanced GISTs after failure of imatinib: relationship between efficacy and tumor genotype in Korean patients.","pubmedId":"21104107"}
