Obstructive jaundice occurring in an 80-year-old woman was caused by the neoplasm rather than the congenital anomaly. Although the annular pancreas did not obstruct the duodenum, it did account for an unusual appearance of the neoplasm on air contrast roentgenography of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The two lesions were successfully treated by radical pancreaticoduodenectomy. The woman has been disease-free for more than 24 months.","title":"Annular pancreas with coexistent ampullary carcinoma in an elderly woman.","pubmedId":"7139427"}
