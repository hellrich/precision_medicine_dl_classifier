In the clinical setting, some pts are able to receive prolonged mtc treatment (Tx) with B. The aim of our research was to explore their clinical characteristics, in order to assess the behavior of these pts who benefit most from B. Methods: In 30 Spanish institutions we studied retrospectively data from 104 pts with advanced nsNSCLC receiving long-time mtc B defined by a PFS  9 months (m), which represents an increase in PFS of approximately 50%, as compared with historical data. Clinical and histological characteristics, Tx received, ORR, median PFS and OS, and safety data were recorded. Results: Pts characteristics: median age 57 years (yr); caucasian: 98%; ECOG PS 0/1/2 (%): 61/38/2; male: 61%; current/former/never smokers (%): 36/45/19; baseline hypertension (HTN)/cardiovascular disease (%): 24/9; adenocarcinoma: 82%; stage IV: 84%; 84% of pts presented 2 metastatic sites; central tumor location: 30%; tumor cavitation: 4%; among 40 pts tested, 8% presented activating EGFR mutations. 1L CT was: carboplatin/cisplatin doublets (%): 57/43; median no. of cycles for CT/B and mtc B was 6 and 18, respectively. Median B dose was 7.5 mg/kg. ORR: 83%. Of 71% of pts who had evidence of PD to 1L, 90% received second-line (2L) Tx. 77% of pts who progressed to 2L, received a third-line (3L). B was maintained in 26% and 24% of pts receiving 2L and 3L. Median PFS: 15 m (CI 95%:14-16); median OS: 31 m (95% CI: 22-39). 1 and 2 yrs survival rates (%): 97 (95% CI: 93 - 100) and 62 (95% CI: 51 - 73). Most frequent B related toxicities (%): gr 1/2 epistaxis (22/0), gr 1/2 HTN (12/6), grade 1/2/3 asthenia (2/6/4) and gr 1/2/3 proteinuria (3/3/1). Conclusions: To our knowledge, these are the first data reported of long-term survivors with advanced nsNSCLC treated with 1L CT/B plus long-time mtc B. Although prospective evaluation is required, the outstanding median OS (31 m) and 2-yr survival (62%) point out the importance of selecting Tx  and the role of mtc B after 1LB. B was very well tolerated, without significant life-threatening toxicities. Subgroup analyses will be presented.","title":"Long-term survivors with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsNSCLC) treated with first-line (1L) chemotherapy (CT) plus bevacizumab (B) and maintenance (mtc) B.","pubmedId":"ASCO_97681-114"}
