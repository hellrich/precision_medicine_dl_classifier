The subjects were 23 cases from 2006 to 2008 in canines and feline diagnosed with meningioma. All were between 8 and 16 years of ages. There were 12 males and 11 females. An appropriate craniotomy was performed for each case according to the initial MRI taken to diagnose meningioma prior to the surgery. Once the dura mater was exposed, an MRI biopsy needle was placed in the tumor as a guide. The first MRI sequence during the surgery was performed with this needle to confirm the location of the tumor. This MRI image was also processed and displayed by multi planar reconstruction to reveal the tumor extent in three dimensions. A Sonopet was applied to the middle of the tumor to destroy the inner part and release pressure from the entire tumor. Creating some space between the brain tissue and tumor, we treated blood vessels and carefully resected them. This procedure was repeated until complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by MRI. Sixteen of the 23 cases survived for more than 2 years postoperatively. The other seven died due to other disorders within 2 years. Our method with MRI navigation during the surgery improved our surgical performance and contributed to a prolonged survival time for the patients. In order to perform multiple MRI procedures smoothly during the surgery, it is necessary to have skillful assistants.","title":"Surgical resection of twenty-three cases of brain meningioma.","pubmedId":"24200893"}
