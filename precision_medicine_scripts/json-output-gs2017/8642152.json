The mean age was 80 +/- 6 years; 59% were female, and 65% were white.\nComprehensive data, including an assessment of the etiology and precipitating factors leading to the development of heart failure, were collected at the time of diagnosis. Iatrogenic heart failure was defined as heart failure precipitated by medications or excessive fluid administration, or occurring as a procedural complication. All patients were followed for 1 year, and the primary outcome measure was total mortality.\nUsing strict criteria, 28 patients (7.0%) were considered to have iatrogenic heart failure. Compared with noniatrogenic patients (n \u003d 373), iatrogenic cases had less severe premorbid cardiac disease but more marked noncardiac disability and longer hospital stays (29 +/- 24 vs 13 +/- 12 days, P \u003c .001). Hospital mortality was 32% in iatrogenic heart failure patients compared with 9% in noniatrogenic cases (P \u003c .001). Cumulative mortality at 1 year was 68% in iatrogenic patients versus 39% in noniatrogenic patients (P \u003c .01). Using a Cox proportional hazards model, iatrogenic congestive heart failure was associated with a relative mortality risk during follow-up of 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.5-4.3) after adjusting for age, sex, prior history of heart failure, New York Heart Association class, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, and serum albumin.\nFrail, debilitated older patients are at increased risk for developing iatrogenic heart failure, even in the absence of clinically evident cardiac disease. In this population, iatrogenic heart failure serves as a marker for poor short- and long-term prognosis, but further study is required to determine the optimal approach to management of these patients.","title":"Iatrogenic congestive heart failure in older adults: clinical course and prognosis.","pubmedId":"8642152"}
