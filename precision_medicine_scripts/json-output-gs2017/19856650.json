Unfortunately, the clinical benefits of anthracyclines are limited by cardiotoxicity that can lead to the development of potentially fatal congestive heart failure. In order to limit anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity, liposomal formulations of doxorubicin have been developed. This retrospective analysis evaluated the experience obtained with non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as first-line therapy in 34 patients with metastatic breast cancer.\nPatients received non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in combination with either cyclophosphamide (n \u003d 14) or docetaxel (n \u003d 20) for up to eight cycles, and efficacy and safety were assessed according to standard criteria.\nThe overall response rate was 71%. The median progression-free survival was 8 months in patients receiving non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide and 13.8 months in those receiving non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus docetaxel (P \u003d 0.2). The most commonly observed toxicities were grade 1-2 leucopenia, alopecia, nausea and vomiting; no grade 3-4 toxicities were observed. Overall, three patients (9%) experienced grade 1 cardiac toxicity.\nOur results support the use of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as an alternative to conventional doxorubicin formulations in combination regimens for the first-line therapy of metastatic breast cancer.","title":"Non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in combination with cyclophosphamide or docetaxel as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer: a retrospective analysis.","pubmedId":"19856650"}
