We studied the hypothesis that patients with melanoma and additional unrelated cancers may harbour mutations in the CDKN2A gene. Twenty seven patients with histologically confirmed melanoma who also had additional cancers such as breast, colorectal, lymphoma and other neoplasms were studied. We also examined 17 additional patients, 13 of whom had a first-degree relative with melanoma and four who had two or more primary melanomas. Some patients belonged to more than one of these categories. No mutations of the CDKN2A tumour suppressor gene were detected among patients with melanoma and additional cancers. The previously described Met53Ile CDKN2A mutation located in exon 2 was detected in a female patient with melanoma metastatic to the regional lymph nodes, multiple primary cutaneous lesions, atypical naevi and a first-degree relative with melanoma. The studied cohort is too small for firm conclusions. However, it would appear that melanoma and additional, apparently unrelated, cancers developing in the same individual are likely to be related to a combination of low-risk susceptibility genes and environmental factors.","title":"The CDKN2A tumour suppressor gene: no mutations detected in patients with melanoma and additional unrelated cancers.","pubmedId":"12459645"}
