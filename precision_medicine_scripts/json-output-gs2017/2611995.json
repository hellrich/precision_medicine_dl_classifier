Recent evidence has suggested that this proto-oncogene may also play a role in human breast cancer. In the present study, we used Southern hybridization analysis to examine DNA from 79 primary and 11 recurrent human breast cancers for evidence of activation of int-2 through either gene rearrangement or amplification. A similar analysis was performed for two other proto-oncogenes, c-erbB-2 and c-myc, also suspected of playing a role in the development of human breast cancer. Proto-oncogene status was correlated with estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor status, patient age, and lymph node (LN) status at the time of surgery. Gene rearrangement was not a frequent occurrence with any of the proto-oncogenes. However, amplification of int-2 occurred at a significantly higher frequency in recurrent breast cancers than in primary cancers and in patients with primary cancers who were less than or equal to 50 years of age versus greater than 50 years of age at surgery. Although amplification of all three proto-oncogenes occurred at a greater frequency in primary tumors from patients with lymph node metastases than from those without lymph node metastases, a significant difference was noted only in the case of c-myc amplification. These findings confirm and extend earlier results of studies of int-2, c-erbB-2 and c-myc amplification in human breast cancers and point to a role for int-2 activation in certain cases of recurrent breast malignant neoplasia.","title":"Amplification of the proto-oncogenes int-2, c-erb B-2 and c-myc in human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"2611995"}
