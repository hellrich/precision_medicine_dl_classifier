Suppressing the proliferation of malignant gliomas cells by altering effector molecules can significantly improve the prognosis of a patient. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules âˆ¼22 nucleotides in length that are able to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in human cancer. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the expression level of miRNA-218 (miR-218) is markedly downregulated in glioma cell lines and human primary glioma tissues. Upregulation of miR-218 in glioma U87 cells dramatically inhibited the proliferation by inducing G1-S checkpoint arrest. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that ectopically expressing miR-218 in glioma U87 cells results in the downregulation of the expression of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)6 and cyclin D1 and upregulation of the expression of p21Cip1/Waf1. In addition, it was identified that miR-218 inactivated the CDK6/cyclin D1/p21Cip1/Waf1 pathway by downregulating CDK6 expression through the direct targeting of the 3\u0027-untranslated region of CDK6. The present results suggest that miR-218 plays an important role in the prevention of the proliferation of glioma cells, and the present study also revealed a novel mechanism for miRNA-mediated direct suppression of the CDK6/cyclin D1/p21Cip1/Waf1 pathway in glioma cells.","title":"miR-218 inhibits the proliferation of glioma U87 cells through the inactivation of the CDK6/cyclin D1/p21Cip1/Waf1 pathway.","pubmedId":"26137139"}
