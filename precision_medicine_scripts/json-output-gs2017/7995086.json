Operating time was significantly longer for Whipple compared to PPPD (5.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.0; p \u003c 0.01). Postoperative morbidity (32 vs. 56%) resulted to 50% after PPPD of early postoperative delayed gastric emptying. Hospital mortality was 6% vs. none, respectively. Histopathologic workup of 28 node positive Whipple specimens revealed node involvement in only 11% along the stomach (1) or the pyloric region (2), but in these cases tumors had obviously close relation to the gastric outlet as the reason to chose Whipple. Actuarial survival was very similar in both groups, being 41 vs. 53% at one year, 13 vs. 18% at two years, and only 3.3% at five years for the whole cohort. In conclusion distal gastric resection in Whipple\u0027s procedure in ductal carcinoma is oncologically not effective. There is no hazard for survival relating to the preservation of the pylorus. Therefore PPPD as the technically less expensive and for nutritional status more beneficial operation should be the procedure of choice also for this type of tumor.","title":"[Risks of radical treatment in pylorus preserving duodenopancreatectomy in ductal carcinoma].","pubmedId":"7995086"}
