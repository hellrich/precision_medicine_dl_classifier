Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized murine monoclonal antibody against the HER2 protein, has been shown to benefit patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer when administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy. When to start therapy, the duration of treatment, adjuvant chemotherapy regimens and cardiotoxicity issues are examined.","title":"Controversies in the use of adjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin).","pubmedId":"17178019"}
