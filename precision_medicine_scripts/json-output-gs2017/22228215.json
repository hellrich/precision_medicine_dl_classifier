Long interspersed element (LINE), an abundant class of retrotransposons, provides a surrogate marker for global hypomethylation. We developed methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assays to study LINE-1 methylation in cases of colorectal, gastric, and endometrial cancer (N \u003d 276), stratified by patient category [sporadic; Lynch syndrome (LS); familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCX)] and microsatellite instability status. Within each patient group, LINE-1 showed lower methylation in tumor DNA relative to paired normal DNA and hypomethylation was statistically significant in most cases. Interestingly, normal colorectal mucosa samples from different patient groups displayed differences in LINE-1 methylation that mirrored differences between the respective tumor tissues, with a decreasing trend for LINE-1 methylation from patients with sporadic colorectal cancer to LS to FCCX. Despite the fact that the degree of LINE-1 methylation is generally tissue specific, normal colorectal mucosa, gastric mucosa, and endometrium from LS patients showed similar levels of LINE-1 methylation. Our results suggest that the degree of LINE-1 methylation may constitute a \"field defect\" that may predispose normal tissues for cancer development.","title":"LINE-1 hypomethylation in familial and sporadic cancer.","pubmedId":"22228215"}
