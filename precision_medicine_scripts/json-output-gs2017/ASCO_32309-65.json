The prognostic value of those mutations for the outcome in primary tumors is controversial. Objective: To assess the spectrum, frequency and prognostic significance of the KIT and PDGFRA gene mutations in Polish group of surgically treated primary GISTs. Methods: DNA isolated from paraffin blocks from 300 patients (pts) with histologically diagnosed primary GISTs included in clinical registry database, were analyzed using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct sequencing for KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12, 14, 18) mutations. For primary GIST risk assessment the Miettinen stratification was used. Results: KIT/PDGFRA genes mutations were found in 82% tumors: KIT was mutated in 69% and PDGFRA in 13% of tumors. KIT exon 11 and 9 mutations were found in 61.5% and 7.5% respectively. Among KIT exon 11 mutants the most frequent were deletions (32.7%) followed by point mutations (15.3%), duplications (8.4%) and complex rearrangements (5.1%). KIT exon 11 mutations were found at the similar rates in tumors with gastric and non-gastric localization (53.9% vs. 46.1% respectively) while KIT exon 9 duplications were more often observed in non-gastric GISTs (86.4%, p\u003d0.00036) and PDGFRA mutations were more frequently found in tumors originated from the stomach (86.8%; p\u003d0.00017). In high risk tumors KIT exon 11 deletions were more frequently found than point mutations (p\u003d0.017). On the other hand mutations in PDGFRA were more often observed in very low-/low- than high risk GISTs as compared to KIT exon 11 (p\u003d0.0026). There was no statistically significant correlation between disease-free survival and the spectrum or frequency of mutations. Conclusions: Spectrum and frequency of KIT and PDGFRA mutations in Polish GIST population are similar to the previously described groups. No significance of mutations for disease outcome after surgery of primary tumors was found.","title":"Spectrum of KIT and PDGFRA mutations in primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors: Polish Clinical GIST Registry experience.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32309-65"}
