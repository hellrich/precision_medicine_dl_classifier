Moreover the role of STAT1 does not directly affect apoptosis in cancer cells after exposure to chemotherapy agents, though some reports showed that STAT1 is associated with apoptosis. In this study, differential display RT-PCR was used to examine the effects of diallyl disulfide (DADS) on human colon cancer cells (colo 205). The results demonstrated that DADS induced the expression of STAT1 which was also confirmed using Western blotting. STAT1 decoy oligonucleotides were also used to block STAT1 mRNA and led to a decrease in the levels of STAT1 and to subsequence decrease in the percentage of apoptosis induced by DADS in examined colo 205 cells.","title":"Diallyl disulfide induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 expression in human colon cancer colo 205 cells using differential display RT-PCR.","pubmedId":"17804871"}
