HR defects promote carcinogenesis and are associated with selective sensitivity to PARP-inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents. We collected 1029 tumor samples in 13 cancer types and used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to survey genes in the HR pathway. NGS on 591 genes was performed using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples on the Illumina NextSeq platform (Caris Life Sciences, AZ). Mutations in as low as 5% of cells can be detected with \u003e 99% confidence. Deletions larger than 27bp may not be detected by this method. Pathogenic or presumed pathogenic variants are counted as mutations. The table summarizes mutation rates of 7 key genesATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK1, CHEK2, PALB2 and PTENincluded in this pilot study. Another 17 HR genesATR, ATRX, BARD1, BLM, BRIP1, FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, MRE11A, NBN, RAD50, RAD51, and RAD51Bwere also analyzed. PTEN mutations were seen in 6.3% of tumors, ATM in 5%, BRCA1 in 2%, BRCA2 in 2%, PALB2 in 1%, and CHEK2 in 1%. No CHEK1 mutations were observed. Overall, 15% of tumors carry at least one mutation in any of the 7 key genes. The highest mutation rates were seen in endometrial (43%), glioblastoma (34%), and gastric cancers (23%). The highest rates of ATM (9.7%), BRCA2 (6.5%), and PALB2 (6.5%) were seen in gastric cancer, while the highest CHEK2 (5.6%), BRCA1 (7.3%) and PTEN (44%) mutations were seen in cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian and endometrial tumors, respectively. One 53-year old pt with metastatic poorly-differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma experienced ongoing radiographic partial response and dramatic symptom relief following 4 cycles of FOLFOX without surgery; tumor analysis revealed a nonsense PALB2 (S326*) gene mutation, while the other 23 HR genes were wild type. ERCC1 showed intact expression by IHC.Mutation rates of 7 genes on the HR pathway in 13 cancer typesThus, mutation rates of at least 8 to 43% in the HR pathway are reported from 13 cancer types. This method can potentially identify responders to DNA-damaging agents including platinum.","title":"Mutations on the homologous recombination pathway in 13 cancer types","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2750"}
