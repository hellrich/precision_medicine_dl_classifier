However, most patients who benefit from EGFR blockade acquire resistance. Although RAS mutation is established as a main cause of primary resistance, the mechanisms of this acquired resistance remain unclear. Here, we aimed to identify the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to EGFR blockade by using circulating cell-free (ccf)DNA to track emerging KRAS, BRAF and S492R mutations during chemotherapy. Methods: We enrolled 33 patients with metastatic CRC and no RAS mutations in their primary tumors. Patients were treated with first-line systemic chemotherapy that included EGFR blockade. We obtained ccfDNA from each patient before they started chemotherapy, and every 23 months during chemotherapy until disease progression. We detected KRAS (codons 12, 13, 61, and 146), BRAF (V600E) and S492R mutations using digital polymerase chain reaction. Results:KRAS mutations were detected in the ccfDNA of 4 of the 33 patients (12%) before chemotherapy. The response rate was 88% (29/33); all four non-responders had KRAS mutations in their ccfDNA and one of the four had both KRAS and BRAF mutations before starting chemotherapy. A response was detected in all patients (29/29) with no KRAS or BRAF mutations in their ccfDNA before chemotherapy. Of the 29 initial responders, 14 (48%) acquired resistance. Emerging KRAS mutations were detected in the ccfDNA of 13 of these 14 patients (93%); eight of these patients had multiple mutations (e.g. G12D and G12V; G13D and Q61H). BRAF mutations were also detected in six patients (43%); none of the patients had solo BRAF mutations. Six patients (43%) had S492R mutations; none of the patients had solo S492R mutations. Only one patient had no KRAS, BRAF or S492R mutations. Conclusions: Emergence of KRAS, BRAF or S492R mutations that were undetectable before the start of chemotherapy may be a mechanism underlying acquisition of resistance to EGFR blockade. Notably, emerging KRAS mutations were detected in most of the patients (93%) who acquired resistance. This indicates that KRAS mutation emergence may play a major role in the acquisition of resistance to EGFR blockade.","title":"Emergence of KRAS mutations and acquisition of resistance to EGFR blockade.","pubmedId":"ASCO_191724-199"}
