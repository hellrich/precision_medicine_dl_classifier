Its antiangiogenic effect is greater than that of its related drug, sorafenib. Regorafenib has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in patients who have failed treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy and, if KRAS wild type, an anti-EGFR therapy. The FDA based this approval on data from the CORRECT trial, which showed the efficacy of regorafenib compared with placebo. The most common grade 3-4 adverse reactions with the drug are hand foot skin reactions (HFSR), diarrhea, hypertension and fatigue. This review discusses the efficacy data, and the incidence and management of regorafenib\u0027s toxicities. ","title":"Management of regorafenib-related toxicities: a review.","pubmedId":"26327919"}
