This study examined whether clinicians are ordering molecular testing for patients with metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC) prior to therapy initiation.\nMembers from a national health plan with lung cancer and metastatic disease were followed retrospectively.\nMembers were identified in medical claims data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, if they had 2 or more claims for lung cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 162.xx) and metastatic disease (â‰¥ 1 claim with ICD-9-CM code 196.xx-198.xx) who were continuously enrolled in a fully insured plan 180 days prior to index date. Patients were excluded if they had a history of chemotherapy used primarily in small cell lung cancer, or a medical claim associated with an unrelated malignancy. The timing of molecular testing was compared with the start of chemotherapy and targeted therapy, if applicable.\nA total of 2623 patients presumed to have mNSCLC were included for analysis; of whom, 52.5% were male with a mean age of 72.5 years (SD \u003d 8.2 years). A total of 1597 (60.9%) patients had a Current Procedural Terminology code associated with molecular testing at any time in their claims history. Of the 733 patients with molecular testing and chemotherapy or targeted therapy claims, testing occurred prior to systemic therapy initiation in 651 (88.8%; 95% CI, 86.1%-90.9%) patients. The median time between testing and therapy initiation was 38 days (interquartile range \u003d 23-69 days).\nAssessment of oncogene mutations and gene rearrangements in mNSCLC routinely occurs prior to treatment initiation as suggested by analyses of claims data from a large US health plan. Validation using patient medical records is needed.","title":"Molecular testing patterns in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26881321"}
