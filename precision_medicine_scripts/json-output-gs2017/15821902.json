CDK4 activity is inhibited by CDKN1C, which is regulated by insulin. In addition, CDKN1C plays an important role in beta-cell proliferation and is involved in the pathogenesis of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a disorder characterized by neonatal hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and pre- and post-natal overgrowth. The aim of this study was to investigate if variations in the proximal promoter and the coding region of the CDKN1C and CDK4 genes are associated with type 2 diabetes or changes in related quantitative phenotypes among glucose-tolerant subjects. Mutation analyses of the two genes in 62 type 2 diabetic patients resulted in the discovery of seven variants of CDKN1C and two variants of CDK4. In a case-control study comprising 717 type 2 diabetic patients and 518 glucose-tolerant subjects the most frequent variants did not show any difference in allele frequencies between the type 2 diabetic patients and the control subjects. However, in two genotype-quantitative trait correlation studies involving 206 glucose-tolerant offspring of type 2 diabetic patients and 359 young, healthy subjects the CDKN1C del171APVA variant associated with increased birth weight (P\u003d0.05 and P\u003d0.05). Furthermore, the same variant tended to be associated with decreased basal glucose oxidation among 16 genotypically discordant dizygotic twins (P\u003d0.03). In a genotype-quantitative trait study involving 500 middle-aged glucose-tolerant subjects the CDK4 IVS2-31G--\u003eA variant was associated with an increased waist circumference (P\u003d0.03) and waist-to-hip ratio (P\u003d0.02) and altered fasting plasma glucose (P\u003d0.03). However, these later findings could not be replicated in additional studies. In conclusion, variants in CDKN1C may contribute to the inter-individual variation in birth weight.","title":"Studies of variations of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C and the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 genes in relation to type 2 diabetes mellitus and related quantitative traits.","pubmedId":"15821902"}
