MDM2 targets p53 for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. p53 reactivation through MDM2 inhibitors seems to be a promising strategy to sensitize p53 wild-type cancer cells to apoptosis. Moreover, additional p53-independent molecular functions of MDM2, such as neoangiogenesis promotion, have been suggested. Thus, MDM2 might be a target for anticancer treatment because of its antiapoptotic and proangiogenetic role. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive asbestos-related tumor where wild-type p53 might be present. The present review gives a complete landscape about the role of MDM2 in cancer pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment, with particular focus on Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.
