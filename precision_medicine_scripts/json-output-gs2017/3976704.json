Systemic hemodynamic values were determined to assess the severity of heart failure. Arterial epinephrine levels were not different between patients with heart failure (73 +/- 92 pg/ml) and patients without heart failure (55 +/- 73 pg/ml). In patients with congestive heart failure, norepinephrine (665 +/- 510 pg/ml, mean +/- SD) and dopamine (407 +/- 405 pg/ml) levels were significantly higher than in patients with stable angina without heart failure (norepinephrine 184 +/- 136 pg/ml, p less than 0.001, and dopamine 197 +/- 259 pg/ml, p less than 0.02). However, in patients with congestive heart failure, the plasma norepinephrine levels did not correlate with cardiac index (r \u003d 0.21, p \u003d NS), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r \u003d 0.11, p \u003d NS), mean arterial pressure (r \u003d 0.11, p \u003d NS), or systemic vascular resistance (r \u003d 0.18, p \u003d NS). Similarly, there was no correlation between dopamine levels and the hemodynamic abnormalities in patients with congestive heart failure. These findings suggest that although endogenous norepinephrine and dopamine levels are frequently elevated in patients with heart failure, reflecting enhanced sympathetic activity, catecholamine levels do not reflect the severity of heart failure.","title":"Endogenous catecholamine levels in chronic heart failure.
