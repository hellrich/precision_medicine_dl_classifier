The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the PIK3CA mutation status for its relationship with prognosis and first-line endocrine therapy outcome. PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 were evaluated for mutations in 1,352 primary breast cancer specimens by SnaPshot multiplex analyses. The mutation status was studied for their relationship with metastasis-free survival (MFS) in 342 untreated lymph node-negative (LNN) patients and to time to progression (TTP) in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients with metastatic disease treated with first-line tamoxifen (N \u003d 447) or aromatase inhibitors (AIs; N \u003d 84). We detected in 423 patients hotspot mutations for PIK3CA (31 %). Mutations in exon 20 were detected in 251 patients (59 %), with H1047L and H1047R mutations in 37 (15 %) and 214 (85 %) cases, respectively. Mutations in PIK3CA exon 9 were discovered in 173 patients (41 %), with E542K and E545K mutations in 57 (32 %) and 104 (60 %) cases as most prevalent ones. Evaluation of the untreated LNN patients for prognosis showed no relationship between MFS and PIK3CA mutations, neither for exon 9 [HR \u003d 1.04 (95 % CI 0.57-1.89), P \u003d 0.90] nor for exon 20 [HR \u003d 0.98 (95 % CI 0.63-1.54); P \u003d 0.94] when compared to wild-type. The PIK3CA mutation status was also not associated with treatment outcome after first-line tamoxifen. On the other hand, patients treated with first-line AIs showed a longer TTP when having a PIK3CA mutation in exon 9 [HR \u003d 0.40 (95 % CI 0.17-0.95); P \u003d 0.038] or exon 20 [HR \u003d 0.50 (95 % CI 0.27-0.91); P \u003d 0.024] compared to wild-types, both significant in uni- and multivariate analysis including traditional predictive factors. All results remained when only HER2-negative patients were evaluated for each cohort. PIK3CA mutations in ER-positive tumors were significantly associated with a favorable outcome after first-line AIs, which needs further confirmation in other datasets. Mutations were not associated with prognosis in untreated LNN patients nor predictive outcome after first-line tamoxifen therapy in advanced disease patients.","title":"Hotspot mutations in PIK3CA associate with first-line treatment outcome for aromatase inhibitors but not for tamoxifen.","pubmedId":"23592373"}
