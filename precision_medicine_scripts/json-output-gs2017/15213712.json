Tissue samples were collected by endoscopic biopsy prior to treatment. RNA was isolated from biopsies and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to determine c-erbB-1 and c-erbB-2 mRNA expression. Relative expression (tumour/paired normal tissue ratio standardised for beta-actin) was calculated for EGFR and c-erbB-2 mRNA. Expression levels were correlated with the objective histopathologic response in resected specimens. Histomorphologic regression was defined as major response when resected specimens contained less than 10% of residual vital tumour cells, or in case a pathologically complete response was achieved. Expression of c-erbB-1 mRNA was not associated with the degree of histomorphological response. In contrast, the relative expression levels of c-erbB-2 mRNA \u003e1 were not associated with major histopathologic responses (sensitivity 41.6%, specificity 100%), and 10 out of 36 (28%) patients could be unequivocally identified, whose tumours did not respond well to the delivered neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (P\u003c0.01). Quantitative expression levels of c-erbB-2, but not c-erbB-1 mRNA, in pretreatment biopsies appear to predict minor histopathologic response to our neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy protocol. This test could be used to prevent expensive, non effective and potentially harmful therapies in approximately one-fourth of our patients, and leads to a more individualised type of combined modality treatment.","title":"Quantitative c-erbB-2 but not c-erbB-1 mRNA expression is a promising marker to predict minor histopathologic response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in oesophageal cancer.","pubmedId":"15213712"}
