Clinicopathological features were compared among patients stratified according to the recurrence pattern and pulmonary metastasis treatment strategy.\nPatients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (n \u003d 96), distal (n \u003d 42), or total pancreatectomy (n \u003d 4). At the last follow-up, 99 patients had developed recurrent post-resection PDAC, including 14 cases of isolated pulmonary recurrence. The median overall survival was significantly longer for patients with isolated pulmonary recurrence (40.3 months) than with other metastases (20.9 months; HR 5.85; p \u003d 0.0156). Two patients underwent resection for isolated pulmonary recurrence, and both survived for âˆ¼70 months after primary resection.\nPatients with first recurrence of PDAC as pulmonary metastasis had a better prognosis than patients with other types of metastases. Moreover, when isolated pulmonary metastasis is controlled for a certain period, pulmonary resection is likely to improve patient survival.","title":"Survival Impact of Pulmonary Metastasis as Recurrence of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26517228"}
