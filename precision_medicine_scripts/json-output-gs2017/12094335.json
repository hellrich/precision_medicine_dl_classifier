This development is based not only on drug efficacy but also on a favorable side-effect profile. Combinations of gemcitabine with antitumor drugs such as cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, docetaxel, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, or capecitabine, and biological agents such as cetuximab or trastuzumab, have yielded promising results in phase II trials. However, none of these combinations has yet reached the level of an evidence-based standard treatment.","title":"Present and future treatment of pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"12094335"}
