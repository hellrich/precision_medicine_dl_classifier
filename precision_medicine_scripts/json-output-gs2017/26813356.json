Abnormal DNA content and deletions were linked to high Gleason score, advanced tumor stage, and positive nodal stage (P \u003c 0.0001 each). The risk of PSA recurrence increased from diploid to tetraploid and from tetraploid to aneuploid DNA status (P \u003c 0.0001 each). However, 40% of patients with Gleason score ≥4+4 and 55% of patients with PSA recurrence had diploid cancers. This fraction decreased to 21% (Gleason ≥4+4) and 29% (PSA recurrence) if PTEN and/or 6q deletion data were added to ploidy data to identify cancers with an aberrant DNA status. The significance of combining both deletions and ploidy was further demonstrated in a combined recurrence analysis. Presence of deletions increased the risk of PSA recurrence in diploid (P \u003c 0.0001), tetraploid (P \u003c 0.0001), and aneuploid cancers (P \u003d 0.0049), and the combination of ploidy data and deletions provided clinically relevant information beyond the CAPRA-S nomogram. Multivariate modeling including preoperatively and postoperatively available parameters identified the \"combined DNA status\" as a strong independent predictor of poor patient outcome.\nThe combinatorial DNA content analysis involving general (ploidy) and specific events (deletions) has the potential for clinical utility in prostate cancer.
