The key demographic and pathologic features associated with EML4-ALK fusion gene have not been definitively established. This meta-analysis was conducted to compare the frequency of the EML4-ALK fusion gene in patients with different clinicopathologic features and to identify an enriched population of patients with NSCLC harboring EML4-ALK fusion gene.\nThe Pubmed and Embase databases for all studies on EML4-ALK fusion gene in NSCLC patients were searched up to July 2014. A criteria list and exclusion criteria were established to screen the studies. The frequency of the EML4-ALK fusion gene and the clinicopathologic features, including smoking status, pathologic type, gender, and EGFR status were abstracted.\nSeventeen articles consisting of 4511 NSCLC cases were included in this meta-analysis. A significant lower EML4-ALK fusion gene positive rate was associated with smokers (pooled OR \u003d 0.40, 95% CI \u003d 0.30-0.54, P\u003c0.00001). A significantly higher EML4-ALK fusion gene positivity rate was associated with adenocarcinomas (pooled OR \u003d 2.53, 95% CI \u003d 1.66-3.86, P\u003c0.0001) and female (pooled OR \u003d 0.61, 95% CI \u003d 0.41-0.90, P \u003d 0.01). We found that a significantly lower EML4-ALK fusion gene positivity rate was associated with EGFR mutation (pooled OR \u003d 0.07, 95% CI \u003d 0.03-0.19, P\u003c0.00001). No publication bias was observed in any meta-analysis (all P value of Egger\u0027s test \u003e0.05); however, because of the small sample size, no results were in the meta-analysis regarding EGFR gene status.\nThis meta-analysis revealed that the EML4-ALK fusion gene is highly correlated with a never/light smoking history, female and the pathologic type of adenocarcinoma, and is largely mutually exclusive of EGFR.","title":"Clinicopathologic features of patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring the EML4-ALK fusion gene: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"25360721"}
