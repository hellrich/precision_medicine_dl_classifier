Many of the genetic changes harboring in the epithelia may possibly be seen in stromal cells during neoplastic transformation. We intended to investigate weather KRAS mutations are shared by the stromal cells in colorectal adenocarcinomas. Forty cases with KRAS mutation were studied. Glandular/epithelial and the stromal components of each primary tumor were collected and KRAS mutation analysis was performed. None of the cases revealed KRAS mutations in stromal integral. We concluded that stromal cells in colorectal carcinoma do not share KRAS mutations that the epithelial component harbors.","title":"Stromal cells do not share KRAS mutations that the epithelial component harbors in colorectal carcinomas.","pubmedId":"21624768"}
