This is in contrast with activating mutations of KRAS, which occur in approximately 20% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to provide direct evidence of KRAS amplification for the first time in clinical specimens. We detected amplification in 7 of 100 consecutive NSCLCs, with a concurrent activating KRAS mutation in 4 cases. KRAS amplification was associated with greater expression of p21 as assessed by quantitative immunohistochemical analysis (P \u003d .015). Our data indicate that a sizable subgroup of NSCLCs harbor KRAS amplification, some of which also contain point mutations, and suggest that an increased KRAS copy number may drive p21 overexpression. KRAS amplification may define a unique clinicopathologic subset of NSCLCs with potentially altered responsiveness to targeted therapies.","title":"In situ evidence of KRAS amplification and association with increased p21 levels in non-small cell lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"19762526"}
