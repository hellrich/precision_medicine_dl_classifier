Although GIST seldom responds to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, early experience with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, STI-571 (Gleevec; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), has been extremely encouraging. Early results have appeared in a recent case report in the New England Journal of Medicine (April 5, 2001),(1) and in early clinical trials from the United States and Europe that were reported at the plenary session of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in San Francisco on May 14, 2001. STI-571 is one of the earliest examples of a nontoxic chemotherapeutic agent (an agent whose anti-cancer activity is not predicated on a cytotoxic mechanism). STI-571 has already shown clinical value in BCR-ABL-positive leukemias. Early clinical results in GIST are so encouraging that oncologists may soon be wrestling with the opportunity of referring every patient with malignant GIST into clinical trials with STI-571. To ensure appropriate treatment, pathologists need to understand the biology and treatment of this tumor and to have standard methods and criteria for providing diagnosis (GIST or not GIST) and consistent prognostic classification (high risk of metastasis or low risk of metastasis).","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor workshop.","pubmedId":"11431711"}
