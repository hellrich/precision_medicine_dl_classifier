We report three cases, in an 87-year-old patient with liposarcoma of the tongue, a 78-year-old patient with multiple recurrent liposarcoma of the orbit and a 42-year-old patient with ethmoido-orbital liposarcoma of metastasis origin. These three cases and a review of the literature were the basis of a summary of the incidence, the anatomic classification and therapeutic options for this type of liposarcomas.","title":"[Liposarcoma of the head].","pubmedId":"7939360"}
