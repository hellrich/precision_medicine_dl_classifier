In a variety of human malignances, c-Met/HGF signaling has been found aberrant, and in many instances has been correlated with advanced disease stage and poor prognosis. Thus, the c-Met has identified as an emerging and interesting target for cancer chemotherapy. In this review, we briefly summarize signaling pathways of c-Met, and discuss the crystal structures of representative c-Met and the binding modes with their ligands. We also present updates on the design, synthesis and structure-activity relationship analysis of c-Met inhibitors developed from 2014 until now. At last, we review the c-Met inhibitors that are in clinical development and highlight the future prospects.","title":"Recent advances on the design and synthesis of c-Met inhibitors as anticancer agents (2014-present).","pubmedId":"27804876"}
