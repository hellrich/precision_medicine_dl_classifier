Surface molecules associated with lung cancer have been identified and their molecular structure and function are being elucidated. Growth factors which stimulate the lung cancer cells in an autocrine fashion have been identified. Genetic changes of lung cancer cells have been defined on a chromosomal and a molecular level. This review summarizes many biologic properties of lung cancer cells that have been described in the literature.","title":"Biology of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"8087528"}
