Cancer testis genes are a group of genes expressed solely in testis and in a range of human malignancies.\nIn this study we determined the expression of cancer testis genes Tsga10, TEX101 and ODF3 in patients with breast cancer.\nFifty patients with breast cancer were enrolled in this study. Breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were also used to determine the expression of testis cancer genes. For both patients and cell lines, cancer testis genes of TSGA10, TEX101 and ODF3 were determined by RT-PCR. The presence of auto antibody against these genes in patients\u0027 serums was carried on by ELISA method.\nSeventy percent of patients showed TSGA10 expression but none of them showed expression of TEX101 and ODF3. Fourteen percent of patients were positive for anti TSGA10 but all patients were negative for anti TEX101 and anti ODF3. Both of breast cancer cell lines exhibited very strong expression of TSGA10.\nBecause of the important roles of Tsga10 in cell proliferation, we concluded that this gene may have a role in proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells and could be used for diagnosis and immunotherapy of breast cancer.","title":"Expression of Testis Specific Genes TSGA10, TEX101 and ODF3 in Breast Cancer.","pubmedId":"23396665"}
