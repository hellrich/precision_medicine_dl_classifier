A previous study shows that the co-administration of Z-360 with gemcitabine significantly prolonged the survival of mice with orthotopically implanted human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. To clarify the therapeutic effects of Z-360 in combined with gemcitabine, we analyzed gene expression. When gemcitabine was administered, CCK-2/gastrin receptor expression was induced in an orthotropic xenograft model; the result indicating that Z-360 could act on gemcitabine-sensitive cells. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that gemcitabine increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a prognostic factor for survival in pancreatic cancer, while Z-360 suppressed this induction of VEGFA gene expression. These results help to explain how Z-360 prolongs survival when used in combination with gemcitabine.","title":"Z-360, a novel cholecystokinin-2/gastrin receptor antagonist, inhibits gemcitabine-induced expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor gene in human pancreatic cancer cells.","pubmedId":"20118543"}
