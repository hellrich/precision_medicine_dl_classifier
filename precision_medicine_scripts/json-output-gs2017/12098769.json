Northern blots and Western blots were carried out to analyze PTEN expression at mRNA and protein levels and the phosphorylation level of PKB /FAK in HLCC lines, and anoikis was examined by using DNA Ladder analysis. It was shown that PTEN mRNA expression was at similar level in 8 HLCC lines. But protein expression did not accord with it\u0027s mRNA expression. There were no PTEN protein detectable in 95C  95D and A(1) cells; very low PTEN protein was expressed in A(549) and A(4)  A(7) cells; and high PTEN protein expressed in H(460) cells. There were no deletion and point mutation in 95D and H(460) cells; and mRNA stability in 95D cells was much lower than that of H(460) cells. Anoikis was observed in PTEN high-expressed H(460) cells with serum lack and loss of adhesion, and 10% serum prevented it from anoikis. PTEN decreased the phosphorylation level of PKB and down-regulated FAK expression in HLCC. These results suggest that PTEN expression is different in 8 HLCC lines, and PTEN was involved in anoikis.","title":"The relationship between PTEN expression and anoikis in human lung carcinoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"12098769"}
