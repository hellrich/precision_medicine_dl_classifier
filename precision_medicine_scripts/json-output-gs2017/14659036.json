{"genes":["cyclooxygenase-2"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Irinotecan possesses significant single-agent activity in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is active in combination with either cisplatin or carboplatin. Two phase III trials completed in Japan have suggested that the combination of irinotecan/cisplatin yields superior survival rates in stage IV NSCLC patients compared to vindesine/cisplatin. The principal toxicities of the irinotecan/cisplatin regimen are neutropenia and diarrhea. This regimen is currently being tested in Japan against regimens commonly used in the United States, such as cisplatin/gemcitabine, cisplatin/vinorelbine, and carboplatin/paclitaxel. These studies include evaluation of monthly as well as weekly schedules of cisplatin in combination with irinotecan as well as a triplet regimen of irinotecan/carboplatin/paclitaxel. Ongoing trials are evaluating these regimens as well as irinotecan/carboplatin and several nonplatinum-based irinotecan-containing doublets in both the first- and second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. Several ongoing trials are attempting to integrate irinotecan with thoracic radiation therapy in stage III NSCLC. These trials are using irinotecan-containing regimens as induction and concurrent therapy with thoracic radiation therapy. Irinotecan is also being evaluated in the preoperative setting in early-stage resectable NSCLC. Many of these trials are also incorporating celecoxib, a potent inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway, in combination with irinotecan-containing regimens in both advanced as well as early-stage NSCLC. Future trials should focus on the integration of the new targeted agents in combination with irinotecan-containing regimens in all stages of NSCLC.","title":"Irinotecan in non-small-cell lung cancer: status of ongoing trials.","pubmedId":"14659036"}
