The goal of this study was to clarify the clinical implications of p53 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β) in pancreatic cancer using immunohistochemistry (IHC).\nSpecimens obtained by surgical resection and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of the primary tumor were used for IHC. EUS-FNA was performed before any treatment. We analyzed the clinical implications of p53 and PDGFR-β IHC. We also performed a comparative analysis of the IHC findings between surgical and EUS-FNA specimens.\nThis study involved 149 patients (120 who did not receive and 29 who received preoperative therapy). EUS-FNA specimens were obtained from 20 patients without preoperative therapy and 20 patients with preoperative therapy. Abnormal p53 and high PDGFR-β expression was significantly correlated with a high incidence of hematogenous metastasis (p \u003c 0.001) and poor postoperative survival (p \u003d 0.006). In patients without preoperative therapy, the results for p53 and PDGFR-β staining were concordant between surgical and EUS-FNA specimens in 95 % of the cases. In patients with preoperative therapy, 80 and 70 % of the patients showed consistent p53 and PDGFR-β expression between surgical and EUS-FNA specimens, respectively.\nPancreatic cancer patients with simultaneous abnormal p53 and high PDGFR-β expression have a significantly higher risk of hematogenous metastasis and a poor prognosis after surgery. IHC evaluation using EUS-FNA specimens may be able to identify patients with highly metastatic pancreatic cancer who may benefit from aggressive therapeutic intervention.","title":"Impact of p53 and PDGFR-β Expression on Metastasis and Prognosis of Patients with Pancreatic Cancer.","pubmedId":"26940582"}
