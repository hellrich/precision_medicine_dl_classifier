We present a case of ALK gene translocation-SCC in which a remarkable tumor response to crizotinib was achieved after the failure of prior chemoradiotherapy. Considering this remarkable response, we conclude that ALK testing in female non-smokers or in any patient unresponsive to the initial regimen of chemotherapy, is recommended for SCC patients.
