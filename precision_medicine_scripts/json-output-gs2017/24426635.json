{"keywords":["Ileum","Intestinal duplication","Perforation"],"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Enteric duplication is a rare anomaly, which is common in pediatric population, and it is very rare in adults. Enteric duplication can occur anywhere from mouth to anus. Ileal duplication is the most common (30 %) followed by duodenum, stomach, jejunum, colon and rectum. Though most cases are presented within the first 2 years of life, some may present at later age. Here we report a case of a 72-year-old male presented to us in emergency as acute abdomen, which was presumptively diagnosed as ca rectosigmoid, but later the patient developed perforative peritonitis. On exploratory laparotomy he was diagnosed as a case of perforated ileal duplication cyst. Though these lesions are very rare, the importance of enteric duplication cysts lies in the fact that they can mimic many disease conditions and may be left untreated.
