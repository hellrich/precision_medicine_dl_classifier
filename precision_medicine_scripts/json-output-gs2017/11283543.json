(1) Other carcinomas such as hepatoma, cholangioma, and pancreatic cancer have also been reported to be related to sex hormones. (2-4) The existence of sex hormone receptors has been demonstrated immunohistochemically in specimens of these diseases. We recently encountered a patient in whom an ampullary carcinoma developed 39 months after the start of androgenic steroid therapy for aplastic anemia. Immunohistochemic analysis of resected tumor specimens of the patient suggested a possible hormonal effect on the tumor oncology.","title":"Ampullary carcinoma developing after androgenic steroid therapy for aplastic anemia: Report of a case.","pubmedId":"11283543"}
