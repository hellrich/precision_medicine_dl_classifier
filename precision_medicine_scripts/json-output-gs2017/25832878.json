Neuroendocrine tumors, adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma/unspecified non-small-cell lung cancer were analyzed separately. Molecular characteristics of adenocarcinoma were evaluated in a subset of young patients.\nOf 2847 patients with lung cancer, 100 were ≤ 40 years old. The young group contained more women, never-smokers and patients presenting with advanced disease. The commonest tumor in young patients was adenocarcinoma. In total, 19 of 34 young patients with adenocarcinoma had tumors with specific molecular alterations.\nLung cancers in young patients have distinctive features but outcomes similar to those in older patients.","title":"Molecular features and clinical outcome of lung malignancies in very young people.","pubmedId":"25832878"}
