Clinicopathological features and overall survival (OS) of the three groups were compared.\nThe median number of LNs examined was 11, and LN metastasis was present in 142 cases (45 %). When LN-positive cases were re-classified according to the proposed staging system, 82 were N1 (26 %) and 60 were N2 (19 %). There was a significant correlation between proposed N-stage and lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, increased tumor size (each p \u003c 0.001), and surgical margin positivity (p \u003d 0.001). The median OS in LN-negative cases was significantly longer than that in LN-positive cases (107.5 vs. 32 months; p \u003c 0.001). Patients with N1 and N2 disease had median survivals of 40 and 24.5 months, respectively (p \u003c 0.0001). In addition, 1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals were 88, 76, 62 %, respectively, for N0; 90, 55, 31.5 %, respectively, for N1; and 68, 34, 30 %, respectively for N2 (p \u003c 0.001). Even with multivariate modeling, the association between higher proposed N stage and shorter survival persisted (hazard ratio 1.6 for N1 and 1.9 for N2; p \u003d 0.018).\nClassification of nodal status in ampullary carcinomas based on the number of metastatic LNs has a significant prognostic value. A revised N-staging classification system should be incorporated into the TNM staging of ampullary cancers.","title":"Substaging Nodal Status in Ampullary Carcinomas has Significant Prognostic Value: Proposed Revised Staging Based on an Analysis of 313 Well-Characterized Cases.","pubmedId":"25783680"}
