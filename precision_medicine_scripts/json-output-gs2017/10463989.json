Neurocutaneous melanosis (NCM) is a rare phakomatosis consisting of congenital abnormal pigmentation of the skin and meninges. The meningeal lesions are particularly prone to malignant change.\nThe authors describe 5 patients with NCM and 1 with primary leptomeningeal melanoma (LMM) seen at 2 treatment centers in the north of England over a 13-year period (1984-1997).\nThe clinical features, progress, radiological findings, and treatment of these patients are discussed. All six died within eight months of their diagnosis, illustrating the difficulties faced in treating patients with these conditions. The authors reviewed the published literature on NCM, concentrating on the various therapeutic strategies that have been tried. Very little consistency in approach was found. Malignant skin lesions in NCM may be less responsive than primary malignant melanoma, but the small number of patients with primary LMM or brain metastases of MM make comparisons with NCM difficult. The authors\u0027 own series illustrates well the piecemeal nature of therapy for patients with these rare conditions.\nThe rate of incidence of MM melanoma in the U.K. is increasing, and it will represent an increasing proportion of the pediatric oncologist\u0027s workload. A consistent approach to the therapy of patients with metastatic MM and NCM is needed if we are to have any hope of offering more than palliative therapy to these children in the future.","title":"Leptomeningeal melanoma in childhood.","pubmedId":"10463989"}
