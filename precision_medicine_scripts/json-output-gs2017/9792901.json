Advances in understanding the molecular basis of pancreatic cancer have allowed identification of molecular targets which are amenable to therapeutic intervention. Such targets include p53, K-ras, p16, and DPC-4. Gene therapy involves the transfer of genetic constructs which alter the neoplastic potential of the cancer cell. Vectors used in gene transfer include viral and non-viral methods. Presently, gene therapy of pancreatic cancer is limited to pre-clinical studies using in vitro and in vivo models. However, the initial results from these pre-clinical studies have been encouraging and will form the basis for clinical studies of gene transfer in patients with pancreatic cancer.","title":"Gene therapy and pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"9792901"}
