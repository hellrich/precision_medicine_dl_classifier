Currently, there are no clinically accepted methods for the identification of patients at highest risk for recurrence and those most likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy. Most research has focused on tumor specific factors for identification of prognostic markers. We evaluated whether peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression could identify patients with worse prognosis following surgical resection. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 108 patients with stage IA to IIIA NSCLC treated with surgical resection. Subjects were recruited from the University of Pennsylvania Thoracic Surgery practices; blood samples were taken the day of surgery. Gene expression profiling of ficoll purified PBMCs was performed with Illumina whole-genome arrays. Longitudinal clinical outcome data was obtained via chart review, direct patient interview, or via the Social Security Death Index. Overall survival was calculated from the day of surgery to date of death. The data were analyzed using the method of Kaplan and Meier, and multivariable modeling. Results: In a univariate analysis, both age and disease stage were associated with OS. In order to identify a set of genes associated with OS, we employed multivariable Cox regression with L1 and L2 penalized estimations. The dataset was split into a training set (54 subjects) and a test set (54 subjects). The expression was dichotomized to high vs. low for any given gene based on median expression level of each individual gene. Model fitting was performed, which identified a 26 gene panel associated with survival. A high score based on 26-gene panel was significantly associated with overall survival in the test set (p\u003d0.009). Conclusions: PBMC gene expression may be useful in identifying patients with poorer prognosis following lung cancer surgery.","title":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression and outcome following surgery for early-stage lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_61027-101"}
