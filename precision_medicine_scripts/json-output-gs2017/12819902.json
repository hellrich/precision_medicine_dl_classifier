Serum glucose, C-peptide and insulin concentrations were measured at baseline (fasting) and also 2 h after 75 gm oral glucose drink. Homeostasis model assessment was used to measure insulin resistance. Hypertension was defined as a blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.\nThere were 53 subjects with hypertension (HBP) and 147 subjects with normal blood pressure (NBP). The mean BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip circumference ratio for HBP and NBP subjects were 27.4+/-0.8, 24.8+/-0.4 kg/m(2); 89.8+/-11.7, 81.1+/-0.9 cm; and 0.87+/-0.08, 0.82+/-0.08 respectively, (p\u003c0.05). The fasting and 2-h plasma glucose concentrations in HBP and NBP subjects were 5.5+/-0.2, 7.2+/-0.3 mmol/l and 5.2+/-01, 6.8+/-0.2 mmol/l respectively (p\u003e0.05). The corresponding fasting and 2-h insulin concentrations were 10.0+/-0.7, 8.0+/-0.4 uU/ml and 47.3+/-3.7, 37.3+/-2.5 uU/ml respectively (p\u003c0.05). The insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) in the HBP and the NBP groups were 2.49+/-0.2 and 1.95+/-0.13 (p\u003c0.05). The two groups had similar fasting and stimulated C-peptide, lipids and HDL concentrations. Correlations were found between blood pressure and the concentrations of lipids, HDL, fasting and stimulated insulin and C-peptide, and between fasting insulin and HOMA-IR with lipids and HDL concentrations. On multiple regression analysis, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR did not influence blood pressure variations significantly.\nWe found clustering of hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance and truncal obesity in hypertensive Ghanaian subjects but dissociation between insulin resistance, hypertension and atherogenic lipid and lipoprotein profile.","title":"Insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular risk factors in hypertensive and normotensive native Ghanaians.","pubmedId":"12819902"}
