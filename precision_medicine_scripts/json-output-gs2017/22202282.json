In September 2000, hepatectomy of right lobe and cholecystectomy were performed for his liver metastasis. Every three to six months follow-up had been kept since adjuvant chemotherapy (200 mg/day of 5-FU per os for two years) completed. Eleven years and two months after sigmoidectomy (in September 2010), a chest X-ray examination detected a small nodule in upper area of his right lung, which was diagnosed as either primary lung cancer or metastatic lung tumor followed by chest CT scan and PET-CT examination. In November 2010, laparoscopy-assisted partial resection of his right lung was performed. Histochemical examination of the resected lung tumor resulted cytokeratin 7(-), cytokeratin 20(+) and TTF-1(-), confirming its final diagnosis as lung metastasis from sigmoid colon cancer. He has been alive for six months without any recurrence since resection of his lung metastasis. It was a very rare case to have more than ten-year interval between colon cancer resection and detection of its lung metastasis. However, when we diagnosed the patient with lung tumor, who had undergone a colorectal resection, we should consider if he had a lung metastasis from colorectal cancer.","title":"[A case whose lung metastasis was detected and resected eleven years after resection of primary colon cancer].","pubmedId":"22202282"}
