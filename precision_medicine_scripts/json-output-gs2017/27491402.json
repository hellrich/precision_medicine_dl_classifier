We conducted a search to find new therapy strategies, new biomarkers, and selected five patents we find relevant.\nOver the last few years, identification of cancer harboring epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (EGFR) or chromosomal rearrangements of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) led to new ways in classifying and treating NSCLC. On the other hand, acquired resistance are a constantly challenge in the management of patients with these mutations and new drugs options are in development to improve and amplify treatment strategies.\nCurrently, EGFR TKIs (e.g.: erlotinib, gefitinib, osimertinib) and ALK inhibitors (crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib) provided a new face for advanced NSCLC outcomes. To understand the disease molecular profile is mandatory to define the best approach for each patient.","title":"EGFR and EML4-ALK Updated Therapies in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","pubmedId":"27491402"}
