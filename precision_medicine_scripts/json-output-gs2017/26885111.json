Blood samples were obtained from the CRC patients before adjuvant therapy. Serum samples from CRC patients and healthy controls were analyzed for PON1 and ARE activities.\nThe PON1 and ARE activities of the patients with CRC were significantly higher compared to those of the control group (PON1 activity is 125.35±20.07 U/L for CRC patients and 1.22±0.48 U/L for control group, P\u003c0.001; ARE activity is 160.76±10.79 U/L for CRC patients). ARE levels showed a positive correlation with smoking status (P\u003d0.04). PON1 activity was higher in colon carcinoma patients (135.95±19.3 U/L) rather than rectal carcinoma patients (97.08±5.24 U/L) but it was not statistically significant (P\u003d0.72).\nSerum PON1 activity is increased in patients with CRC, and serum ARE levels showed a positive correlation with smoking status. PON1 activity was higher in colon carcinoma patients. There is no other study in literature investigating these activities for CRC patients. It should be reevaluated by larger clinical trials.","title":"Paraoxonase-1 and arylesterase activities in patients with colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"26885111"}
