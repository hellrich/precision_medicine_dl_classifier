Erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib are approved for use in patients with the most common forms of EGFR activating mutations (ie, exon 19 deletions or L858R substitutions). However, no TKIs are approved for patients with EGFR activated by any other mutation, including exon 20 insertions or other uncommon substitutions, or for patients with any class of HER2 activating mutation (including exon 20 insertions). As inhibition of wild-type (WT) EGFR is associated with dose-limiting toxicities, a TKI that inhibits oncogenic EGFR and HER2 variants more potently than WT EGFR is more likely to be able to be dosed to efficacious levels. AP32788 is a potent inhibitor of all oncogenic forms of EGFR and HER2, including exon 20 insertions, with selectivity over WT EGFR.Activity of AP32788 and other TKIs was assessed by measuring viability of Ba/F3 cell lines engineered to express 20 mutant variants of EGFR (n \u003d 14) or HER2 (n \u003d 6): 4 EGFR variants containing a common activating mutation with or without a T790M resistance mutation, 8 EGFR/HER2 variants containing an exon 20 activating insertion (eg, EGFR ASV, HER2 YVMA), and 8 EGFR/HER2 variants containing other uncommon activating mutations (eg, EGFR G719A, HER2 G776V). Inhibition of WT EGFR was assessed by measuring effects on EGFR phosphorylation in cells (A431) that over-express WT EGFR. Consistent with their clinical activity, erlotinib and gefitinib generally only inhibited the 2 EGFR variants with common activating mutations more potently than WT EGFR (IC50s 71 and 56 nM, respectively), and afatinib generally only inhibited EGFR with common activating mutations or uncommon substitutions more potently than WT EGFR (IC50 4 nM). In contrast, AP32788 inhibited all 14 mutant variants of EGFR (IC50s 2.4-22 nM), and all 6 mutant variants of HER2 (IC50s 2.4-26 nM), more potently than it inhibited WT EGFR (IC50 35 nM), including all 8 variants with exon 20 activating insertions. In mice implanted with a patient-derived tumor containing an EGFR exon 20 activating insertion, or with engineered Ba/F3 cells containing a HER2 exon 20 activating insertion, once daily oral dosing of AP32788 induced regression of tumors at doses that were well tolerated (30-100 mg/kg). In vivo efficacy was associated with inhibition of EGFR signaling in the tumor.AP32788 potently inhibited all activated forms of EGFR and HER2 tested, including exon 20 insertions, more potently than WT EGFR, suggesting it may have the selectivity necessary to achieve efficacious levels of exposure in patients. A phase 1/2 clinical trial of AP32788 in NSCLC patients is planned.","title":"AP32788, a potent, selective inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 oncogenic mutants, including exon 20 insertions, in preclinical models","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2644"}
