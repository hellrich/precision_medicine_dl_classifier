Its use for diagnosing local tumor recurrence after surgical resection has not been described.\nTo determine the sensitivity of EUS-FNA for this indication.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nTertiary referral hospital in the United States.\nConsecutive patients referred for EUS with clinical and/or radiographic suspicion of pancreatic cancer recurrence.\nEUS Â± FNA of retroperitoneal mass.\nSensitivity of EUS-FNA.\nSeventeen patients (9 male, median age 71 years) underwent EUS at a median of 17 months (range 7-46 months) after a classic Whipple procedure (n \u003d 7), pylorus-sparing Whipple procedure (n \u003d 7), or distal pancreatectomy (n \u003d 3) for suspected local recurrence of pancreatic cancer. The primary tumor (median size 2.5 cm, range 1.5-7.9 cm) was located in the head in 14 patients, the body in 1, and the tail in 2. Final surgical margins at any site were positive in only 1 of 17 patients (+ retroperitoneal margin). At the time of suspected recurrence, 4 patients (24%) were asymptomatic. EUS disclosed a mass (median size 21 mm, range 12-30 mm) in 16 of 17 patients (94%). Transgastric EUS-FNA (n \u003d 16, median 4.5 passes, range 2-10) disclosed recurrent malignancy in 13 of 16 (79%), atypical cells in 1 of 16 (7%), and benign cytology in 2 of 16 (14%). Subsequent radiographic evidence of increasing tumor burden was seen in 1 of 2 patients with benign cytology; however, follow-up for the 2 other patients with benign biopsy specimens was not available. Depending on the status of the 2 patients without available follow-up, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of EUS-FNA for the diagnosis of recurrent cancer ranged from 81% to 93%, was 100%, and ranged from 81% to 93%, respectively.\nSmall, single-center retrospective cohort.\nEUS-FNA is sensitive for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal recurrence of pancreatic cancer after surgical resection.","title":"EUS-guided FNA of local recurrence of pancreatic cancer after surgical resection.","pubmedId":"20869713"}
