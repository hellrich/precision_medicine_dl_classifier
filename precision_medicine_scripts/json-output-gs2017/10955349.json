Although no significant aggravation of APS was noted following renal biopsy, catastrophic exacerbation of APS occurred 3 days after a lung adenocarcinoma biopsy while warfarin and prednisolone were being administered. The patient died of multiple organ failure 37 days after the lung adenocarcinoma biopsy. This case emphasizes the need for great caution for catastrophic exacerbation of malignancy associated APS following biopsy of the underlying malignancy.","title":"Catastrophic exacerbation of antiphospholipid syndrome after lung adenocarcinoma biopsy.","pubmedId":"10955349"}
