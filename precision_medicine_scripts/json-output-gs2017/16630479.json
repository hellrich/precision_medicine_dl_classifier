Direct PCR sequencing was used to investigate the mutation status of c-kit gene exons 9, 11, 13, 17 and PDGFRA gene exons 12 and 18.\nThe ultrastructural features of all 6 cases were similar to those of the interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC). None of the 6 cases were found to have c-kit gene mutations. However, three tumors were found to harbor PDGFRA exon 18 activating mutations, including two tumors having an Asp--\u003eVal842 missense mutation and one having an Arg--\u003eSer841 missense mutation.\nPDGFRA mutations may provide an important alternative molecular mechanism for the development of gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","title":"[Ultrastructural features and platelet-derived growth factor receptor A gene mutations in CD117-negative gastrointestinal stromal tumor].","pubmedId":"16630479"}
