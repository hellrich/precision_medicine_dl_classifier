The present authors review CMN types and prognoses, as well as absolute and relative indications for treatment. Risks and benefits of several treatment options are discussed, including surgical options, such as excision, chemical peels, dermabrasion and curettage, and laser therapy. The main focus of treatment is, in all cases, to address the concern for developing melanoma, at the same time optimizing the aesthetic and functional outcomes.","title":"Congenital melanocytic nevi needing treatment.","pubmedId":"15953143"}
