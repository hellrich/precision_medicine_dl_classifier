Here we report that germline NRAS mutations conferring enhanced stimulus-dependent MAPK activation account for some cases of this disorder. These findings provide evidence for an obligate dependency on proper NRAS function in human development and growth.","title":"A restricted spectrum of NRAS mutations causes Noonan syndrome.","pubmedId":"19966803"}
