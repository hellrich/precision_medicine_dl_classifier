When MUC1 expression was low, HER3 co-expression did not influence the prognostic value of MUC1 (P \u003d 0.488). MUC1 expression had no correlation with survival, tumour stage or grade, or to the prognostic value of HER4.\nA high MUC1 expression was associated with a favourable prognosis in patients with bladder cancer when the expression of HER3 was also high. This suggests an involvement of HER3 in MUC1 function in bladder cancer.","title":"Co-expression of HER3 and MUC1 is associated with a favourable prognosis in patients with bladder cancer.","pubmedId":"24467768"}
