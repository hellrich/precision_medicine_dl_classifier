This study was undertaken to determine the expression profile of PD-L1 in patients with Kras-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and to investigate the activation of Kras codon subtypes as a mechanism of PD-L1 regulation.Immunohistochemistry analysis of PD-L1 expression (SP142 clone) on 117 LUAD (KrasWT, n \u003d 51; KrasG12D, n \u003d 25; KrasG12V, n \u003d 14; KrasG12C, n \u003d 27), showed significantly greater expression of PD-L1 in both tumor and immune cells compartments in Kras mutant LUAD compared with KrasWT wild-type tumors (37% vs. 18%; P \u003d 0.005). PD-L1+ tumors had greater CD66b+ neutrophil infiltrate and lower CD8+ T-cell infiltrate than PD-L1 tumors, notably in KrasG12D tumors.To determine the effect of Kras codon subtypes on PD-L1 expression, stable cell lines were generated by transfection of KrasG12D, KrasG12V, KrasG12C and KrasWT plasmids into Beas2B bronchial cells. At basal level, mutant Kras led to significantly higher cell-surface PD-L1 expression and PD-L1 transcripts, notably in KrasG12C and KrasG12V cells, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Moreover, there was differential activation of NF-kB, ERK and Pi3k/Akt pathways between Kras mutant subtypes. In addition, PD-L1 was upregulated 3-fold by stimulation with IFN, independently of the Kras codon subtypes. Instead, hypoxia significantly increased PD-L1 expression in KrasG12C and KrasG12D cells. Co-culture experiments with human PBMCs from healthy patients were performed to determine the functional effect of altered PD-L1 expression. Increased PD-L1 expression by tumor cells induced by Kras mutations led to decreased PBMCs proliferation and increased apoptosis.PD-L1 is expressed in 37% of Kras mutant LUAD, suggesting PD-L1 as a therapeutic target in this subset. According to the Kras mutation subtype, potential drugs targeting the NF-kB, ERK or Pi3k/Akt pathways may increase the antitumor adaptive immune responses.","title":"Impact of Kras mutant subtypes on PD-L1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-4025"}
