However, concomitant mutations are found in a small number of patients and the effect of these on response to targeted therapy is still unknown.\nWe considered 380 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who underwent nonsequential testing for EGFR and EML4-ALK translocation. KRAS mutation analysis was also performed on 282 patients.\nWe found 1.6%, 1.1%, and 2.5% of patients who showed a double mutation comprising EGFR and EML4-ALK, EGFR and KRAS, and EML4-ALK and KRAS, respectively. Twenty-eight patients with EGFR mutation underwent first-line therapy with a tyrosine kinase receptor; a clinical benefit was observed in 81.8% of patients with EGFR mutations only and in 67% of those who also showed an EML4-ALK translocation. Twelve patients with an EML4-ALK translocation received crizotinib and 7 of these had disease progression within 3 months (2 had a concomitant KRAS mutation and 1 had a concomitant EGFR mutation). Two patients showed stable disease, 1 of whom also had a KRAS mutation. Two patients obtained a partial response and 1 had a complete response; all harbored an EML4-ALK translocation only. The median overall survival of patients who carried an EML4-ALK translocation alone or concomitant with a KRAS mutation was 57.1 (range, 10.7-not reached) and 10.7 (range, 4.6-not reached) months, respectively.\nConcomitant EGFR, EML4-ALK, or KRAS mutations can occur in NSCLC. Concomitant KRAS mutation and EML4-ALK translocation represents the most common double alteration and confers a poor prognosis.","title":"Nonsquamous, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients Who Carry a Double Mutation of EGFR, EML4-ALK or KRAS: Frequency, Clinical-Pathological Characteristics, and Response to Therapy.","pubmedId":"26712101"}
