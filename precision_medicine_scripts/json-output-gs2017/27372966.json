The copy number of BIRC5 has been indicated to be highly increased in tumor tissues; however, its association with the age of onset in breast cancer is not well understood.\nForty tumor tissues of breast cancer were obtained from Tumor Bank of Cancer Institute, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran. BIRC5 gene copy number variation (CNV) was evaluated using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) and then compared with the age of onset for each patient.\nBIRC5 amplification was seen in 17.5% of cases. Also, a significant association was observed between BIRC5 gene amplification and individuals under 40 years of age (P\u003d0.04).\nBIRC5 gene has the potential to be a marker for the detection and prognosis of cancer at an early age.","title":"BIRC5 Genomic Copy Number Variation in Early-Onset Breast Cancer.","pubmedId":"27372966"}
