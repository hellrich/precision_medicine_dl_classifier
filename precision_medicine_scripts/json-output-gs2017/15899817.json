Gefitinib is currently being applied in clinical studies as either a monotherapy, or as part of a combination therapy against prostate, head and neck, gastric, breast, and colorectal tumors. However, success rates vary between different tumor types, and thus it is important to understand which molecular target(s) are responsible for limiting the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. In this study, we ask whether expression of HER2 affects sensitivity to gefitinib in human lung cancer cells. We established two clones, LK2/HER2-32 and LK2/HER2-57, by transfecting HER2 cDNA into LK2, a NSCLC line with a low expression level of HER2. We observed no mutations in exons 18, 19, and 21 of EGFR gene in LK2, LK2/mock- and two HER2-trasfectants when we observed in-frame deletion mutations (E746-A750) adjacent to K745 in a gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell line, PC9. These LK2/HER2-32 and LK2/HER2-57 were much more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of gefitinib than the parental LK2 lines. Treatment with 0.5 to 1 micromol/L gefitinib specifically blocked Akt activation in both HER2-transfectant lines, but not in the parental LK2 cells. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 activation, however, was not blocked by gefitinib up to 10 micromol/L in either the parent or transfectant lines. Gefitinib was also shown to induce cell cycle arrest in the G1-S phase, and an accompanying increase of p27Kip1 was observed. LK2/HER2 transfectants showed constitutive formation of HER2/HER3 heterodimer, which were seen to associate with a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, p85alpha, when active. Treatment of LK2/HER2 cells with gefitinib markedly decreased the formation of HER2/HER3 heterodimers, HER3 basal phosphorylation, and the association of p85alpha with HER3. This study is the first to show that under basal growth conditions, HER2 sensitizes low-EGFR NSCLC cell lines to growth inhibition by gefitinib.","title":"HER2 overexpression increases sensitivity to gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, through inhibition of HER2/HER3 heterodimer formation in lung cancer cells.","pubmedId":"15899817"}
