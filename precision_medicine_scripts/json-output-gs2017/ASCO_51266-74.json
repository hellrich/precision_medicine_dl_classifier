Preclinically, everolimus (E), an oral inhibitor of mTOR, enhances activity, reverses resistance to H and demonstrates synergistic activity with paclitaxel (T). The objective of this phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy of E combined with T and H in heavily pretreated HER2-positive MBC pts. Methods: A multicenter, Novartis sponsored, phase II trial was conducted using: T 80mg/m2, IV on days 1, 8 and 15 q4w; H 4mg/kg IV loading dose, then weekly 2mg/kg; E daily 10mg in patients whose disease is resistant to both H (progression on or within 3 months of the end of H therapy for metastatic cancer or within 12 months after the end of neoadjuvant or adjuvant H) and taxanes (progression on or within 4 months of the end of taxane therapy for metastatic cancer or within 12 months after the end of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.) Treatment continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Results: The study completed enrollment (n\u003d55). Analyses were performed on 37 evaluable pts. Median treatment duration is 12 weeks (2-43) with19 pts still on treatment and 6 beyond 6 cycles. Pt characteristics were median age 56 y; visceral disease in 33 pts (89%) with lung and liver involvement in 18 pts (49%) and 21 pts (57%), respectively; median no. of prior chemo lines for metastatic disease 3 (range 0-8); prior anthracyclines in 25 pts (68%); prior lapatinib in 23 pts (62%). Twenty-five pts were evaluable for efficacy. We observed 5 (20%) confirmed PRs, 14 (56%) SDs and 6 (24%) PDs. Treatment was well tolerated. G3-4 neutropenia occurred in 12 pts (32%) with 1 case of febrile neutropenia, G3 stomatitis in 5 pts (13%) and G3 asthenia/fatigue in 2 pts (5%). Conclusions: These preliminary results confirm a previous phase I study showing that E in combination with T and H has an acceptable safety profile and promising anticancer activity in HER2-positive MBC pts pretreated with trastuzumab and taxanes. Updated safety, efficacy, and PFS results will be presented.","title":"Everolimus in combination with weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab in patients (pts) with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with prior resistance to trastuzumab and taxanes: A multicenter phase II clinical trial.","pubmedId":"ASCO_51266-74"}
