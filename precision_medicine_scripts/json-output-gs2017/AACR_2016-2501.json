In recent years, the FDA approved several promising treatments for malignant melanoma. However, treatment often fails due to the survival and regrowth of drug-resistant cells. Studies by our lab and others suggest that Melanoma Initiating Cells (MIC), a CD133+ population that forms xenograft tumors, may represent an intermediate stage in the acquisition of stable drug resistance. This study aims to determine the effect of CD133-expression and drug resistance in metastatic melanoma cells harboring difficult-to-treat mutation signatures by focusing on the two main downstream cascades of MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Our results show that triple combination therapy using mebendazole (repurposed anthelmintic BRAF inhibitor), trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and metformin (repurposed anti-diabetic mTOR inhibitor) synergistically reduces cell viability of NRASQ61K melanoma cells when compared with mebendazole, trametinib or metformin alone. Further, the surviving fraction from each monotherapy is highly enriched for CD133+ cells. Thus, the multi-kinase inhibitor trametinib, along with repurposed anthelmintic and anti-diabetic drugs may inhibit MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, which could potentially be an effective therapy for the resistant subpopulation of melanoma initiating cells.","title":"Combination therapy with mebendazole, trametinib and metformin eliminates recalcitrant NRASQ61K melanoma cells","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2501"}
