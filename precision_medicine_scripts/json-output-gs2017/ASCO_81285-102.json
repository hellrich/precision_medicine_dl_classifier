This study was performed to assess the relationship between kinase mutation types of the tumor and treatment efficacy of imatinib in a large number of Korean patients with metastatic and recurrent GISTs.  Methods:  Clinical data were collected from 370 consecutive patients (pts) with metastatic or recurrent GISTs treated with first line imatinib between Feb. 2003 and Dec. 2007 at 20 institutions in Korea. Genotypes of the tumor were determined in 290 pts by direct sequencing of the genomic DNA for KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and PDGFRA exons 12, 14, and 18.  Results:  A total of 261 (90.0%) of 290 pts had mutations in KIT gene: 222 (76.6%) at exon 11, 35 (12.1%) at exon 9, and each two (0.7%) at exon 13, and 17. 4 pts (1.3%) had mutations in PDGFRA gene: 1 at exon 12, 3 at exon 18. 25 pts (8.6%) had no mutation in KIT or PDGFRA gene. Among the 235 pts with measurable lesions, there were 16 CRs (6.8%), 126 PRs (53.6%), and 86 SDs (36.6%), making the ORR 60.4%. Pts with KIT exon 9 mutation achieved significantly inferior response rate (11 of 30 pts, 36.7%) compared to those with KIT exon 11 mutation (112 of 176 pts, 63.6%; P\u003d.007). Total 290 pts were assessable for progression-free survival (PFS). With a median follow-up of 42.8 months, pts with KIT exon 11 mutation (median 49.4 months) had significantly longer PFS than those with KIT exon 9 mutation (median 28.7 months, P\u003d.001) or wild-type (median 33.1 months, P\u003d.048). On the multivariate analyses, the genotype of the tumor (KIT exon 9 vs. KIT exon 11: HR\u003d2.427, P\u003d.003) remained independent prognostic factors for PFS as well as performance status (ECOG 2-3 vs. 0-1: HR\u003d2.385, P\u003d.005) and granulocyte counts (\u003e7,500/L vs. 7,500/L: HR\u003d3.756, P\u003d.003).  Conclusions:  This study confirmed that imatinib efficacy was different by genotype of the GIST in Asian patients as well as Western patients. Patients with KIT exon 9 mutations had poorer response and inferior PFS at the standard dose of imatinib 400 mg per day and may benefit more with a higher dose of imatinib.","title":"Imatinib efficacy by tumor genotype in Asian patients with metastatic or recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs): A retrospective study of Korean GIST Study Group (KGSG).","pubmedId":"ASCO_81285-102"}
