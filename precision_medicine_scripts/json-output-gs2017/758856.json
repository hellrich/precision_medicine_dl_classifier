Melanomas in this location accounted for 1.8% of a total of 1,140 patients with primary clinical Stage I and Stage II melanomas treated during a 28 year period. Wide excision with axillary lymph node dissection in selected instances has resulted in no mortality and no local recurrence to date. This approach allowed the preservation of a major portion of the breast in eight female patients. It is emphasized that melanoma is a cutaneous lesion and considerations applying to lymphatic dissemination of parenchymal disease of the breast need not apply.","title":"Cutaneous melanoma of the breast.","pubmedId":"758856"}
