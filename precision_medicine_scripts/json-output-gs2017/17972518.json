Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) might phosphorylate GSK3beta into inactive phosphorylated GSK3beta-ser9 (P-GSK3beta-ser9).\nP-GSK3beta-ser9 and EGFR expressions were examined on tissue microarrays (TMA) of lung carcinoma (n\u003d154) by immunohistochemistry and compared with clinicopathological parameters of the tumors, including the expression of Ki-67 and phosphatase and tensin homology deleted from human chromosome 10 (PTEN), as well as survival data.\nThe P-GSK3beta-ser9 expression was highest in adenocarcinoma (AD) and lowest in small cell carcinomas (SCC), compared with other types of lung carcinoma (p\u003c0.05). Its expression was negatively correlated with PTEN and Ki-67 expression (p\u003c0.05), but not with age, gender, pleural invasion, lymphatic or venous invasion, lymph node metastasis or Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC) staging (p\u003e0.05). EGFR was strongly expressed in squamous carcinomas (SQ), compared with other types of lung carcinomas. Its expression was also positively correlated with lymphatic and venous invasion and P-GSK3beta-ser9 expression, and negatively with the PTEN expression of the tumors (p\u003c0.05), but not with the age, gender, pleural invasion, lymph node metastasis, or UICC staging (p\u003e0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that P-GSK3beta-ser9 and EGFR expressions were negatively linked to survival of lung carcinoma patients when stratified according to histological type (p\u003c0.05).\nP-GSK3beta-ser9 and EGFR are involved in the histogenesis of different lung carcinomas. Their overexpression might result from PTEN loss and can be considered as markers of worse prognosis in lung carcinoma patients.","title":"Phosphorylated GSK3beta-ser9 and EGFR are good prognostic factors for lung carcinomas.","pubmedId":"17972518"}
