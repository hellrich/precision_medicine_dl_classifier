Methods: Plasma EGFR mutations from 145 chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC were examined by using denaturing high- performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and associations of EGFR mutations with tumor response to chemotherapy and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Results: 37.2% (54/145) of the patients was detected to have EGFR mutations in their plasma DNA. The response rate of mutated EGFR carriers to the chemotherapy was 37% (20/54), similar to that of 31.9% (29/91) of wild-type EGFR carriers to the chemotherapy (P\u003d 0.323). Stage IV NSCLC patients with mutated EGFR had a longer PFS than those with wild-type EGFR (4 vs 3 months, P\u003d0.043) after the first-line chemotherapy. The median survival time and 1-, 2- year survival rate for the patients with EGFR mutations (24 months and 85.7%,43.7%) were increased than those with wild-type EGFR (18 months and 65.7%,25.9%) (p\u003d0.0468). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that clinical stage (IV vs IIIb), response to the first-line chemotherapy (PR vs PD), and EGFR mutations were independent prognostic factors (P\u003d0.008, 0.000 and 0.000 respectively). Conclusions: We conclude that plasma EGFR mutations in the Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC were not associated with response to the first-line chemotherapy, but Stage IV NSCLC patients with mutated EGFR had a longer PFS after the chemotherapy.","title":"Association of plasma EGFR mutations with response to first-line chemotherapy and prognosis in Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32520-65"}
