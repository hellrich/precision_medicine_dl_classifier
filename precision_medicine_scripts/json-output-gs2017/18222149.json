This will improve outcomes for patients with NSCLC.\nAn understanding of the molecular targets and clinical variables that are predictive and prognostic of outcome in NSCLC will help nurses better care for these patients.","title":"EGFR mutations and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"18222149"}
