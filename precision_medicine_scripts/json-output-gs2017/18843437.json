Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas were subdivided into solitary tumors and tumors with intrahepatic metastasis.\nComplete tumor removal (R0 resection) was performed in 42 patients (75%). The 5-year survival rate for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n \u003d 56), patients with a solitary tumor (n \u003d 46), and patients with intrahepatic metastasis (n \u003d 10) were 32, 38, and 0%, respectively. There was a significant difference in survival between patients with a solitary tumor and those with intrahepatic metastasis (p \u003c 0.0001). The 5-year survival rate for patients with stage I (n \u003d 3), II (n \u003d 9), III (n \u003d 15), and IV disease (n \u003d 26) was 100, 67, 37, and 0%, respectively. There was a significant difference in survival between stage I and stage IV (p \u003d 0.011), between stage II and stage IV (p \u003d 0.0002), and between stage III and stage IV (p \u003d 0.0015). The most frequent site of recurrence was the liver. Univariate analysis showed that intrahepatic metastasis, portal vein invasion, hepatic duct invasion, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion, and positive surgical margin (R1) were significantly associated with poor survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed that intrahepatic metastasis was a significant and independent prognostic indicator after surgical resection for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (p \u003d 0.001). No patient with intrahepatic metastasis survived more than 10 months in this study.\nIntrahepatic metastasis was the strongest predictor of poor survival in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Surgical outcome and prognostic factors in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18843437"}
