However, little is known about the prognostic role of PIK3CA mutation in colon cancer.\nUsing 450 resectable colon cancers (stage I to III) in two independent prospective cohorts, we detected PIK3CA mutation in 82 tumors (18%) by pyrosequencing. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of colon cancer-specific and overall mortalities, adjusted for patient characteristics and tumoral molecular features, including the CpG island methylation phenotype, microsatellite instability (MSI), LINE-1 hypomethylation, and p53, CIMP, KRAS and BRAF mutation.\nCompared with patients with PIK3CA wild-type tumors, those with PIK3CA-mutated tumors experienced an increase in colon cancer-specific mortality according to univariate analysis (HR \u003d 1.64; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.86), which persisted after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors for cancer recurrence (including MSI; multivariate HR \u003d 2.23; 95% CI, 1.21 to 4.11). The effect of PIK3CA mutation on cancer survival seemed to differ according to KRAS mutational status. Among patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, the presence of PIK3CA mutation was associated with a significant increase in colon cancer-specific mortality (HR \u003d 3.80; 95% CI, 1.56 to 9.27). In contrast, PIK3CA mutation conferred no significant effect on mortality among patients with KRAS-mutated tumors (HR \u003d 1.25; 95% CI, 0.52 to 2.96).\nAmong patients who undergo a curative resection of colon cancer, PIK3CA mutation is associated with shorter cancer-specific survival. The adverse effect of PIK3CA mutation may be potentially limited to patients with KRAS wild-type tumors.","title":"PIK3CA mutation is associated with poor prognosis among patients with curatively resected colon cancer.","pubmedId":"19237633"}
