Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT is involved in numerous diseases including melanoma, mastocytosis, multiple myeloma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. To better understand the regulation of activation, we studied the two c-KIT isoforms, c-KIT(-) and c-KIT(+), which differ by a tetrapeptide insert GNNK, located in the extracellular juxtamembrane domain of the c-KIT(+) isoform. This region is important for regulating receptor activation. Here we show that the consecutive elimination of one amino acid at a time from the GNNK tetrapeptide insert gradually increases receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, ubiquitination, internalization and downstream MAP kinase-ERK activation. Successively decreasing the insert length progressively improves cell survival during drug treatment. Our results indicate that the length of the tetrapeptide fine-tunes receptor activity, thus providing deeper insight into c-KIT activation.
