The difference between these 2 groups was statistically significant. The Her-2/neu oncogene positive rate in infiltrative ductal carcinoma was 33.3%, the lower the differentiation, the higher the positive rate. Histological typing is also related to the positive rate, comedocarcinoma (intraductal carcinoma) expresses the highest positive rate while lobular carcinoma the lowest. Selection of fixation fluid and the mastering of diagnostic criteria are also important. In the author\u0027s opinion, only membrane staining in monoclonal antibody C-erbB-2 can be recognized as truly positive. In conclusion, Her-2/neu oncogene expression can be used as a supplemental marker when considering prognosis in breast cancer.","title":"[Study of Her-2/neu oncogene in relation to prognosis of human breast cancer].","pubmedId":"7909501"}
