Two targets of interest include the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB and cyclooxygenase-2, which are constitutively activated and overexpressed, respectively, in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We have previously shown that dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT), a bioavailable nuclear factor-κB inhibitor, and the cyclooxygenase inhibitors sulindac and celecoxib have potential chemotherapeutic efficacy. The current study evaluates the efficacy of intervention with DMAPT and sulindac in the LSL-Kras(G12D);Pdx-1-Cre genetically engineered mouse model. Gemcitabine, traditionally a chemotherapeutic agent, has relatively low toxicity; thus, combinations with low-dose gemcitabine were also explored.\nLSL-Kras(G12D);Pdx-1-Cre mice at 7 months of age were randomized into placebo, DMAPT (40 mg/kg per day), sulindac (20 mg/kg per day), gemcitabine (50 mg/kg twice weekly), and combination treatment groups. After 3 months of treatment, the mice were killed.\nThe percentage of normal pancreatic ducts was significantly increased by the combinations of DMAPT/sulindac, DMAPT/gemcitabine, sulindac/gemcitabine, and DMAPT/sulindac/gemcitabine compared to placebo. Additionally, the percentage of mouse pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-2 lesions was significantly decreased by DMAPT/gemcitabine.\nIntervention with DMAPT and sulindac in combination with gemcitabine may delay or prevent progression of premalignant pancreatic lesions in the LSL-Kras(G12D);Pdx-1-Cre mouse model of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Efficacy of dimethylaminoparthenolide and sulindac in combination with gemcitabine in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"22699205"}
