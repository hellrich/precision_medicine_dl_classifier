Methods: The genomic profiles of 50 PDXs from advanced gastric cancer (AGC) were analyzed by targeted next-generation sequencing. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and expressions of EGFR, HER3, c-Met, PTEN and c-Myc were determined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemisty, respectively. Results: A total of 581 non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNV), 513 Indels, and 225 amplifications were identified in 50 PDXs. Pathway analysis revealed recurrent alterations in the MAPK signaling, ErbB signaling, VEGF signaling, mTOR signaling and cell cycle pathway. The ErbB family amplified in 8% (EGFR), 10% (ERBB2), 2% (ERBB3) and 2% (ERBB4) of the 50 PDXs respectively. Meanwhile, several activating mutations in EGFR (L858R and G719S), ERBB3 (P1212S) and ERBB4 (R1174Q) were also detected in our study. Moreover, we detected 7 PDXs harboring PIK3CA activating mutations (E545K, Q546K, H1047R) and 2 PDXs with PTEN loss. Whether PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors could turn over the primary or acquired resistance of anti-HER2 therapies remains further researches. Genes in the cell cycle pathway altered in 70% of the 50 PDXs. The mutation rates of TP53, BRCA1 and BRCA2 were 28%, 8% and 14%. We also detected amplifications of CCNE1, CCND1 and MYC in 16%, 6% and 20% of the xenografts. In this study, 9 PDXs (18%) were EBV positive, with frequent alterations of ARID1A but rare mutations of TP53, and a robust expression of PD-L1. However, we didnâ€™t observe any loss of MMR protein expressions. Conclusions: Several potential therapeutic targets were identified based on the molecular signature of PDXs in advanced gastric cancer, which will provide evidences for drug development.","title":"Excavation of therapeutic targets based on the molecular signature of patient-derived tumor xenografts in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-3855"}
