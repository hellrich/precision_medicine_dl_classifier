Acinar features were present in 24% of the METex14 samples. Six cases (2%) harbored MET Y1003X mutations affecting binding of the MET-negative regulator, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. The median age of all patients with METex14 was 73 years (range 43-95) and 60% were female. Concurrent, murine double minute gene (MDM2) amplification, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 gene (CDK4) amplification, and EGFR amplification were observed in 35%, 21%, and 6.4% of patients with METex14, respectively. KRAS mutation was observed in 3% of cases. Concurrent MET amplification (METamp) (median copy number 10) was identified in 15% of METex14 samples. Significant differences in tumor mutational burden and type of the METex14 alterations were observed between the METamp and non-METamp samples. Response to MET TKI was observed in both in patients with METamp and in patients without METamp METex14.\nDiverse targetable METex14 alterations were identified in patients with NSCLC across age groups, including elderly patients, and in all major NSCLC histologic subtypes with an overall frequency of 2.7%. These findings support the use of hybrid capture-based molecular profiling across NSCLC subtypes to identify patients who will potentially benefit from MET TKIs.","title":"Characterization of 298 Patients with Lung Cancer Harboring MET Exon 14 Skipping Alterations.","pubmedId":"27343443"}
