Exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of the KIT and exons 12 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene were analyzed for the presence of mutations by PCR amplification and direct sequencing.\nKIT or PDGFRA mutations were detected in 21 of the 30 patients (70%). Sixteen patients had mutations within KIT exon 11, three within KIT exon 9, and two within PDGFRA exon 18. GISTs with KIT exon 9 mutations were predominantly located in the small intestine, showed a spindle cell phenotype, and were assessed as potentially malignant. GISTs with KIT exon 11 mutations were located in the stomach and intestine, showed mainly a spindle cell phenotype, and were scored as potentially malignant (P \u003c 0.05). Tumors with KIT exon 11 codon 557/558 deletion/insertion mutations were found to be associated with a potentially malignant clinical behaviour (P \u003c 0.003). GISTs with PDGFRA mutations located in stomach showed a mixed cell phenotype and were classified as of very low or low moderate malignant potential.\nDetermination of KIT and PDGFRA mutations should be additional parameters for the better prediction of GISTs clinical behaviour. Tumors with deletion/insertion mutations affecting codons 557/558 of the KIT gene seem to represent a distinct subset of malignant GISTs.","title":"KIT exon 11 codon 557/558 deletion/insertion mutations define a subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors with malignant potential.","pubmedId":"18350628"}
