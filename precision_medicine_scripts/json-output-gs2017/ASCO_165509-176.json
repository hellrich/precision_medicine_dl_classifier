In vitro data with a panel of 5 HRPBC cell lines with and 4 without FGFR1 amplification revealed that hormonal deprivation (preclinical model of aromatase inhibition) abrogated cell growth by \u003e 90% in FGFR1-negative cell lines but less than 50% in the remainder. Nintedanib is a multikinase inhibitor of VEGFR1-4, PDGFRA/B and FGFR1/3, and has activity in several malignancies. Its anti FGFR1 effects are less studied than its antiangiogenic effects. In vitro it lacked effect against FGFR1-negative lines but induced 40-70% growth inhibition in the amplified ones. Only the combination of hormonal deprivation and nintedanib induced \u003e 90% cell growth inhibition in FGFR1-amplified cell lines. The data were confirmed in a FGFR-1 amplified xenograft model controlled by sorafenib (antiangiogenic without anti-FGFR1 activity). FGFR inhibitors have not shown high activity in HRPBC patients with FGFR1 amplification; our data suggest that the combination with aromatase inhibitors is required. Methods: Multicentric, phase I, dose escalation study followed by an expansion cohort. Dose-escalation: 3+3 design with fixed dose of letrozole (2.5 mg/d) and escalating levels of nintedanib, starting in 150 mg/b.i.d. (maximum of 250 mg/b.i.d.), on a continuous schedule. Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile and blood samples for determining FGF23 (pharmacodynamic engagement of FGFR1), will be drawn on days 1, 15 and 28 of first cycle. Expansion cohort: 10 patients, treated with the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for 1 month (optional 6 months). FGF23 will be determined on days 1, 15, 29 and monthly thereafter. Objectives: Primary: determine the RP2D based in the toxicity and PK profiles; assess PD engagement (expansion); secondary: toxicity and safety (in both phases). Key inclusion criteria: Postmenopausal HRPBC women \u003e 18 years old with negative HER2 that have been receiving adjuvant treatment with letrozole for less than 6 months at the inclusion date. Patient enrollment started in August 2015.
