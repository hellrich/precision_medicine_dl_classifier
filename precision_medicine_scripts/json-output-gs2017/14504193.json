It is believed that genes of lower penetrance, but of greater prevalence, may also modulate a woman\u0027s risk of breast cancer. We studied the association of breast cancer and the trinucleotide repeat polymorphism (CAGn) in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene (AR) in 299 cases of breast cancer and in 229 hospital-based controls from The Philippines. Women for whom the mean length of the CAG repeat allele was \u003c or \u003d 25 units had approximately one-half of the risk of breast cancer compared with women with a mean repeat length of \u003e or \u003d 26 [odds ratio (OR), 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28-0.8). The association with breast cancer risk was particularly strong among older women (\u003e or \u003d 50 years; OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.04-0.94). The association was also observed for the longer of the two AR alleles; there was a 5% increase in breast cancer risk for each unit increase in CAG repeat number. These findings support the theory that short trinucleotide repeat genotypes of the AR gene protect against breast cancer.","title":"Androgen receptor gene polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility in The Philippines.","pubmedId":"14504193"}
