This study had applied the immunohistochemical method to detect the 188 cases of lung adenocarcinoma and expression of Cripto-1 protein and Activin-A protein in 100 cases of normal lung tissue. Then, analysis the relationship between these two-gene protein and clinical lung adenocarcinoma histopathological features, and inherent correlation between these two genes. The positive expression rate of Cripto-1 protein in lung adenocarcinoma tissue was significantly higher in normal lung tissue, while, the positive expression rate of Activin-A protein in lung adenocarcinoma tissue was significantly lower than in normal lung tissue. The high expression of Cripto-1 and low expression of Activin-A was closely related (each P\u003c0.05) to the TNM staging of lung adenocarcinoma, lymph node metastasis and the main pathological tissue staging of lung adenocarcinoma. And the correlation analysis showed that it was negative correlation for the expression of Activin-A protein and Cripto-1 protein in lung adenocarcinoma. The over expression of Cripto-1 and the expression lack of Activin-A were correlated with the occurrence, development, metastasis and malignant degree of lung adenocarcinoma.
