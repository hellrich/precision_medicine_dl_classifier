Patients, however, may develop resistance to EGFR inhibitors. We demonstrated previously that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induced resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) in lung cancers harboring EGFR mutations. We therefore determined whether HGF could induce resistance to the anti-EGFR antibody (EGFR Ab) cetuximab in lung cancer cells, regardless of EGFR gene status. Methods: Cetuximab sensitivity and signal transduction in lung cancer cells were examined in the presence or absence of HGF, HGF-producing fibroblasts, and cells tranfected with the HGF gene in vitro and in vivo. Results: HGF induced resistance to cetuximab in H292 (EGFR wild) and Ma-1(EGFR mutant) cells. Western blotting showed that HGF-induced resistance was mediated by the Met/Gab1/Akt signaling pathway. Resistance of H292 and Ma-1 cells to cetuximab was also induced by co-culture with lung fibroblasts producing high levels of HGF and by cells stably transfected with the HGF gene. This resistance was abrogated by treatment with anti-HGF neutralizing antibody. Conclusions:HGF-mediated resistance is a novel mechanism of resistance to EGFR Ab in lung cancers, with fibroblast-derived HGF inducing cetuximab resistance in H292 tumors in vivo. The involvement of HGF-Met-mediated signaling should be assessed in acquired resistance to EGFR Ab in lung cancer, regardless of EGFR gene status.","title":"Hepatocyte growth factor induces resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody in lung cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-1896"}
