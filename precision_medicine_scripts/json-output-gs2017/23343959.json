Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate tissue samples from patients with ampullary carcinomas (n\u003d71) using antibodies against livin, Ki-67 (a proliferation marker), and caspase-3. Livin was detected in 33/71 cases (in the cytoplasm of all and in the nucleus of only 2 cases). High livin expression correlated with cell differentiation, tumor-node-metastasis stage, and lymph node metastasis (P\u003d0.001, P\u003c0.001, and P\u003d0.028, respectively). Caspase-3 and Ki-67 expression were significantly associated with differentiation (P\u003c0.001, P\u003d0.008, respectively). There was a significant negative correlation between livin and caspase-3 (r\u003d-0.575, P\u003c0.001), and a positive correlation between livin and Ki-67 (r\u003d0.308, P\u003d0.009). Survival of patients with high livin expression was shorter compared with that of patients with low livin expression (P\u003d0.001). Expression of caspase-3 was not associated with overall survival in this cohort (P\u003d0.335). Livin expression was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio 2.693, P\u003d0.017), as was lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio 4.959; P\u003c0.001). In this study livin expression significantly correlated with the proliferation marker Ki-67, but was negatively correlated with caspase-3 expression. These data suggest that livin may be a valuable prognostic factor for human ampullary carcinoma.
