By dual color FISH, one of these three tumors had two populations of tumor cells with the coexistence of amplified Myc and ERBB2, and Myc and EGFR. The second tumor had a high level of amplification of Myc without amplification of ERBB2 or EGFR. The third tumor had a low level of coamplification of Myc and ERBB2. A case of polysomy 8 also demonstrated amplification of ERBB2 and EGFR.\nThe present study shows that genomic instability due to Myc amplification may cause specific amplification of EGFR and/or ERBB2.","title":"Gene amplification of Myc and its coamplification with ERBB2 and EGFR in gallbladder adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19331129"}
