Overexpression of Aurora-A, a new oncogene, can induce centrosome amplification, aneuploidy and tumor formation. Aurora kinases are closely associated with breast cancer. In this article, we reviewed the mechanisms of Aurora kinases inducing tumorigenesis of breast cancer via interacting with p53 gene, BRCA1 gene, PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, gene polymorphism, estrogen, and so on, analyzed the expression of Aurora kinases in breast cancer and its relationship with prognosis.","title":"[Roles of Aurora-A in tumorigenesis and prognosis of breast cancer].","pubmedId":"19635209"}
