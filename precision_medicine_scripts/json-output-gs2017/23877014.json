Total radiation doses ranged from 45 to 61.2 Gy (median, 50.4 Gy) in 1.8-2 Gy (median, 1.8 Gy) fractions.\nAt a median follow-up of 33 months, 46 of the 62 patients survived. Only 2 irradiated lymph nodes, 24 and 28 mm in diameter, in 1 patient progressed after irradiation alone with 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions. All 33 metastatic lymph nodes ≥ 30 mm in diameter were controlled by irradiation at a median dose of 55.8 Gy. The 3-year lymph node-progression free rates were 98.2% in all 62 patients and 98.0% in all 111 metastatic lymph nodes. Except for transient hematologic reactions, 2 patients developed grade ≥ 3 therapy-related toxicities, 1 with an ulcer and the other with perforation of the sigmoid colon. In addition, 2 patients experienced ileus after irradiation.\nRadiation therapy effectively controlled pelvic lymph node metastases in patients with uterine cervical cancer, with most nodes \u003c24 mm in diameter controlled by total doses of 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions and larger nodes controlled by 55.8 Gy, particularly with concurrent chemotherapy. Higher doses to metastatic lymph nodes may increase intestinal toxicities.","title":"Radiation therapy for pelvic lymph node metastasis from uterine cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"23877014"}
