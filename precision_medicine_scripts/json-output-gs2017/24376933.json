Many non-dermatological conditions have been linked with psoriasis, including cardiovascular diseases, depression, inflammatory bowel disorders, and some cancers, i.e. lung, colon and kidney cancers. Among systemic factors are endocrine and metabolic disturbances as well as many drugs. Erythrodermic psoriasis, the most severe form of the disease, is characterized by diffuse erytrema and scaling, often accompanied by fever, chills, and malaise. A 57-year-old Caucasian man was admitted for curative radiation therapy of adenocarcinoma of the prostate after 3 months of initial hormonal therapy. The management comprised the combined androgen blockade (CAB). On admission the patient reported escalation of psoriasis symptoms, which he had been treated for since 2002. Due to a mild course of the disease he had not required any systemic treatment ever before, even during aggravation periods. The last exacerbation started appearing a month after hormonal therapy implementation. The cutaneous eruptions, already existing, become larger with new foci revealing, mainly on upper and lower limbs. During radiotherapy planning, there appeared a diffuse erythema and scaling on hands and feet with accompanying pruritis. We decided to start the previously planned radiation therapy which included the prostate gland with 1.5 cm margin and provided for the total dose of 72 Gy in 36 fractions. The irradiation was conducted with the four-field technique using a megavoltage linear accelerator. During radiotherapy we photo-documented skin lesions. To our best knowledge hormone therapy (androgen deprivation) of prostate cancer patients has not been reported as an aggravating factor. Thus, the aim of our work is to present the case of a prostate cancer patient who experienced psoriasis exacerbation after implementation of hormonal blockade as a neoadjuvant oncological treatment.
