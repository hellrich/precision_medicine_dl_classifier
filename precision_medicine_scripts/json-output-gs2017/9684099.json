Although few patients have been treated, the preliminary results of the phase I lung cancer gene therapy clinical trials are very promising. Clinically relevant basic research in the molecular pathogenesis and immunology of lung cancer is progressing. As improved vector technologies are developed, new opportunities will be available to initiate lung cancer gene therapy trials that are based on a more detailed understanding of lung cancer biology. In conclusion, although important biologic and technical questions remain unanswered, recent research suggests that gene therapy will have a profound impact on lung cancer treatment.","title":"Gene therapy for lung cancer.","pubmedId":"9684099"}
