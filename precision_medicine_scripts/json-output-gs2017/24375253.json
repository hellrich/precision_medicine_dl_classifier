Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we detected the expressions of miR-218 in the tissues and adjacent tissues of GIST and in the GIST cell lines including GIST882, GIST430, GIST48, and GIST-T1. Forty-eight hours after the miR-218 mimic was transfected into the GIST-T1 cells, the expression of miR-218 in the GIST-T1 cells was detected by qRT-PCR. The effect of miR-218 on the GIST-T1 cell viability was detected using MTT. The effect of miR-218 on the proliferation and apoptosis of GIST-T1 cell was analyzed using flow cytometry. Transwell invasion chamber was applied to detect the effect of miR-218 on the invasion of GIST-T1 cells. KIT was identified to be a target gene of miR-218 by the luciferase reporter enzyme system, and the effect of miR-218 on the expression of KIT protein in cells was determined using Western blotting. As shown by qRT-PCR, compared with that in the GIST adjacent tissue, the expressions of miR-218 in the tumor tissue and GIST cell lines were significantly decreased (P \u003c 0.0001). Compared with the control group, the expression of miR-218 increased significantly in GIST-T1 cells transfected with miR-218 mimic for 48 h (P \u003c 0.01). MTT showed that the cell viability decreased significantly after the overexpression of miR-218 in the GIST-T1 cells (P \u003c 0.01). Flow cytometry showed that the cell proliferation index significantly declined after the overexpression of miR-218 (P \u003c 0.01); meanwhile, the apoptosis of cells also significantly increased (P \u003c 0.01). Detection using the Transwell invasion chamber showed that the number of cells passing through the Transwell chamber significantly dropped after the enhanced expression of miR-218 (P \u003c 0.01). Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that, compared with the control group, the relative luciferase activity significantly declined in the miR-218 mimic transfection group (P \u003c 0.01). Compared with the control group, the expression of KIT protein in the GIST-T1 cells transfected with miR-218 mimic for 48 h significantly decreased (P \u003c 0.01). In conclusion, the expression of miR-218 decreases in human GIST tissue and cell lines. miR-218 can negatively regulate the expression of KIT protein and inhibit the proliferation and invasion of GIST cells. Treatment based on the enhanced expression of miR-218 may be a promising strategy for GIST.
