These aggressive subtypes are characterized by the capacity for invasion of normal brain with frequent and destructive recurrence patterns. Effective local therapies include surgery and radiation, but there is a need for novel molecular targets to improve survival and reduce morbidity for this group or cancer patients. We have recently identified the N-myc down regulated gene 4, NDRG4, protein as being overexpressed in aggressive meningioma, and have proposed to study its role in cell survival, invasion/migration and angiogenesis. We utilized shRNA-containing Lentiviral plasmids to downregulate NDRG4 mRNA and protein expression in two high grade meningioma cancer cell lines, IOMM-Lee and CH157MN. Downregulation resulted in reduction in cell survival, and G2-M cell cycle arrest. Utilizing DNA laddering and Annexin V/APC flow cytometry, we determined that the predominant form of cell death was apoptosis. NDRG4 downregulation also decreased cellular invasion and migration, as determined by a number of assays, including: spheroid migration, linear and radial wound healing assays, Boyden chamber matrigel invasion and 3D invasion assays. To determine the effect of NDRG4 depletion on angiogenesis, we utilized immortalized brain endothelial cells, bEnd.3 cells. We treated the bEnd.3 cells with conditioned media from the NDRG4 depleted IOMM-Lee and CH157MN cells, and the ability to form bEnd.3 capillary-like tubes, to proliferate and to invade was abrogated. NDRG4 is not overexpressed in bEnd.3 cells, and direct NDRG4 depletion had no effect on the cells. This study is significant as it is the first to demonstrate the role of NDRG4 in meningioma tumor biology. NDRG4 is involved in modulating cell proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis in meningioma, and may play a valuable role as a molecular target in its treatment.","title":"Targeting oncogenic NDRG4: A promising strategy for meningioma treatment","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2282"}
