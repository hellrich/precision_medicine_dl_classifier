A histological specimen of the nerve-tumor interface is available only if the facial nerve was hopelessly adherent to the tumor (usually a large or giant neoplasm) and the surgeon decided to sever the nerve to obtain a complete removal. The authors have examined immunohistochemically the nerve-tumor interface of 20 such facial nerves (six cases of neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and 14 of non-NF2) in a series of 351 acoustic neurinomas. The largest extrameatal dimension of the 20 tumors ranged from 20 to 51 mm (median 39 mm). In all of these 20 instances the nerve-tumor contact area was at least partially devoid of a clear-cut histological cleavage plane. Where the facial nerve trunk was attached to the surface of the tumor, nerve fibers of the contact areas either abutted directly against tumor cells or nerve fibers were seen to penetrate into the tumor tissue. Frank embedding of nerve fibers was more frequent in NF2.","title":"Interface between the facial nerve and large acoustic neurinomas.
