Exisulind and its analogs have been shown to induce apoptosis in vitro in many cancer cell lines, including CaP cell lines without affecting normal human cells.\nMen with biopsy-proven, localized CaP (Gleason score â‰¥6) amenable to RP were offered enrollment into the trial. The treatment group (n \u003d 44) was given oral exisulind (375-400 mg) daily for 4 weeks and then underwent RP. The control group underwent RP per routine (n \u003d 49). The primary endpoint was change, from biopsy to prostatectomy specimens, in apoptosis biomarkers (bcl-2, Bax, par.-4, caspase 3, PTEN) between the 2 groups.\nThere were no significant effects of exisulind on biomarkers of cell death between biopsy specimen and posttreatment RP specimen. The drug was well tolerated and there were no drug-related serious adverse events or deaths.\nExisulind is a well-tolerated drug with minimal adverse events; however, we were unable to detect any significant differences in apoptotic biomarkers among those treated with neoadjuvant exisulind compared with controls at the dose and duration tested. Future studies should consider evaluating a higher dose or longer duration to better evaluate the role exisulind may play in the treatment of men with CaP.","title":"A prospective, controlled phase II study of neoadjuvant exisulind therapy before radical prostatectomy: effect on apoptosis.","pubmedId":"22503761"}
