The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway involved in DNA crosslink repair may affect CM susceptibility and prognosis. Using data derived from published genome-wide association study, we comprehensively analyzed the associations of 2,339 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 autosomal FA genes with overall survival (OS) in 858 CM patients. By performing false-positive report probability corrections and stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, we identified significant associations between CM OS and four putatively functional SNPs: BRCA2 rs10492396 (AG vs. GG: adjusted hazard ratio (adjHR)\u003d1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u003d1.16-2.95, P\u003d0.010), rs206118 (CC vs. TT+TC: adjHR\u003d2.44, 95% CI\u003d1.27-4.67, P\u003d0.007), rs3752447 (CC vs. TT+TC: adjHR\u003d2.10, 95% CI\u003d1.38-3.18, P\u003d0.0005), and FANCA rs62068372 (TT vs. CC+CT: adjHR\u003d1.85, 95% CI\u003d1.27-2.69, P\u003d0.001). Moreover, patients with an increasing number of unfavorable genotypes (NUG) of these loci had markedly reduced OS and melanoma-specific survival (MSS). The final model incorporating with NUG, tumor stage, and Breslow thickness showed an improved discriminatory ability to classify both 5-year OS and 5-year MSS. Additional investigations, preferably prospective studies, are needed to validate our findings.
