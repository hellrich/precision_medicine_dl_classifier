The cells resistant to G418 were selected. The characteristics of the E1A-expressing Anip 973(Anip 973-E1A) cells were studied in vitro and in vivo, including cell growth rate and doubling-time, colony-forming efficiency on soft agarose, tumorigenicity and metastasis.\nThe growth rate of E1A-Anip 973 cells was diminished and their colony-forming efficiency was inhibited significantly. The tumorigenicity in nude mice of the E1A-expressing Anip 973 was markedly suppressed.\nE1A suppresses the malignant phenotype of human lung adenocarcinoma cell line. This study provides experimental data for gene therapy of lung cancer with E1A.","title":"[Effect of adenovirus type 5 E1A gene on proliferation and metastasis of human lung adenocarcinoma cells].","pubmedId":"11778271"}
