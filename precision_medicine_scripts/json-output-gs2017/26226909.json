After little progress over the ensuing 15 years, 2 combination treatment programs recently conferred improved survival compared with gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer: FOLFIRINOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Importantly, our understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer continues to grow. This improved biologic understanding holds great promise for integrating new targeted and immune-modifying therapies into current treatment programs.","title":"Therapeutic Approaches for Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26226909"}
