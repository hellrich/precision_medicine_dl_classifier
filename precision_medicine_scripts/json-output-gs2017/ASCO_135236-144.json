MEK inhibitors can potentiate the MAPK inhibition in tumor, while alleviating the unwanted paradoxical MAPK activation. We hypothesized that addition of a MEK inhibitor would enhance the immunosensitization effects of BRAF inhibition, with decreased toxicity.  Methods:    A mouse model of syngeneic BRAFV600E driven melanoma (SM1) was developed. C57BL/6 mice treated with myeloid-depleting total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation, were implanted SM1 tumors subcutaneously, followed by iv injection of 3x106gp100 peptide-activated pmel-1 splenocytes when tumors reach 4-5mm. For bioluminescent imaging (BLI), splenocytes were transduced with luciferase-transfected retrovirus. Activated splenocytes from wild type C57 BL/6 mice were controls. BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (D), MEK inhibitor trametinib (T), vehicle (V), or D+T, were given daily by oral gavage from the day of ACT.  Results:    Combination of D+T with pmel-1 ACT showed complete tumor regression, not observed in any other groups, including D+T with control ACT (mean volume of 0 mm2  pmel+D+T, vs 30 C57+D+T, 118 pmel +D on day 20, P\u003c0.0001 by one way ANOVA). BLI showed increased T cell infiltration to tumors with the triple combination, compared to ACT with D, or V. Intracellular IFNr staining of the tumor infiltrating T cells did not show significant difference among groups, indicating trametinib is not detrimental to the effector functions. No significant toxicity observed with the triple combination by weight.  Conclusions:    The MEK inhibitor trametinib, when combined with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and ACT immunotherapy, enhances the antitumor effect, with increased infiltration and preserved function of effectors. Our findings support the testing of this combination in patients with BRAFV600E mutant metastatic melanoma.","title":"Combinatorial effect of dabrafenib, trametinib, and adoptive cell transfer (ACT) in an immune-competent murine model of BRAFV600E mutant melanoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_135236-144"}
