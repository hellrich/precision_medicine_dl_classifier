The woman was initially operated on because of meningothelial meningioma of the fronto-basal region, and 2 months later showed a primitive-non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma, localized in the same area as the meningioma. The published literature on the meningioma-primary cerebral lymphoma association is revised.","title":"Meningioma-primary brain lymphoma association.","pubmedId":"15641595"}
