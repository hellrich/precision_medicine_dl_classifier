These agents include vinorelbine (Navelbine), paclitaxel (Taxol), docetaxel (Taxotere), gemcitabine (Gemzar), and irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar). Used alone, these drugs display activity comparable to cisplatin. The combination of cisplatin and one of the newer drugs produces better survival than treatment with cisplatin (Platinol) alone. Randomized studies of chemotherapy regimens that include these newer drugs have demonstrated improved survival, fewer side effects, or both, compared with earlier standard combinations such as cisplatin/vindesine or cisplatin/etoposide. Docetaxel and perhaps some of the other newer drugs are of value for patients previously treated with platinum-containing regimens. Future studies should determine whether combinations of these newer drugs are superior to cisplatin-containing regimens. Although improved survival is the most important factor in defining the best regimen in non-small-cell lung cancer, additional considerations include patient tolerability, costs of administration, and the rationale for and ability to include noncytotoxic agents (such as inhibitors of signal transduction pathwriys or angiogenesis) into the therapeutic program.","title":"Rationale for non-platinum chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC.","pubmedId":"11497229"}
