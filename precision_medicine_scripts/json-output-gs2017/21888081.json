They are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during endoscopic or barium studies. About 80% GISTs have a KIT (CD 117 antigen) gene mutation. Most affect exon 11, less commonly exon 9,13 or 17, that results in uncontrolled KIT signaling. This led to effective systemic therapies in the form of small molecule inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase such as imatinib mesylat. With the purpose of providing standardized approach to rational and effective diagnostic and treatment algorithm in Croatia, a multidisciplinary session was organized. Results of the session are given in the form of Consensus guidelines.","title":"[Consensus guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors].","pubmedId":"21888081"}
