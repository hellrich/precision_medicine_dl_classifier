She had never smoked, and had no history of exposure to known carcinogens, no history of serious illnesses and no family history of malignancy. Superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. A CT scan of the chest disclosed a round tumor in the left lower lobe and marked enlargement of the ipsilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.\nCT scan of the chest, routine hematological study, sputum smear and culture for acid-fast bacilli, transbronchial lung biopsy, serum tumor markers, CT scan of the abdomen, MRI scan of the head, bone scintigraphy, lung function tests, blood gas analysis, pathological examination including hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry using chromogranin A, CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule), and cytokeratin antibodies.\nLimited-stage small-cell lung cancer (T1N2M0, clinical stage IIIA).\nEtoposide plus cisplatin chemotherapy with concurrent accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy, left pneumonectomy and lymph-node dissection.","title":"Small-cell lung cancer with lymphadenopathy in an 18-year-old female nonsmoker.","pubmedId":"16826220"}
