Tremendous efforts have witnessed the failure of many chemotherapeutic regimens and the current standard-of-care therapy, gemcitabine (GEM), extends patient survival by only a few weeks. Numerous studies implicate the need for the drugs that can target multiple signaling events in pancreatic cancer. Recently, cucurbitacins, tetracyclic triterpenoid compund/molecules, belonging to a family of Cucurbitaceae have shown promising anti-cancer activities such as antiproliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis induction. Here, we report the anticancer activity of a novel analogue of cucurbitacin (Cuc D) that is able to target important signaling proteins involved in pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis.Methods: Herein, we investigated the use of Cuc D for the treatment of pancreatic cancer using a panel of pancreatic cancer cells. The effect of Cuc D on the growth of pancreatic cancer cells was determined by CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay using six pancreatic cancer (MiaPaCa-2, CaPan-1, HPAF-II, Panc-1, BxPC-3 and AsPc-1) cells. Cell growth kinetic assay was carried out at 24, 48, 72 and 96h. The clonogenic potential of cancer cells was also studied using the colony formation assay. microRNA-21 expression levels were investigated through Real-time PCR. Immunoblotting techniques were performed to determine the effects of Cuc D at the molecular level.Results: Our results indicate the anticancer effects of Cuc D in pancreatic cancer cells. Cuc D induces concentration dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in a panel of gemcitabine sensitive/resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines at nano molar concentrations. It also inhibits colony formation and metastasis potential of pancreatic cancer cells in dose and time dependent manner. Importantly, Cuc D targets and inhibits proteins, MUC13, Bcl2 and survivin (inhibitor of apoptosis protein family member: IAP) that are involved in proliferation, metastasis and tumor progression as seen through Western blotting. Additionally, the treatment of Cuc D induces the phosphorylation of p53 (p-p53; ser-15) in pancreatic cancer cells. We also observed that Cuc D effectively inhibits miR-21 levels in pancreatic cancer, HPAF-II cells as seen through Real time PCR analysis. miR-21 is an oncogenic miRNA that is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer.Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that Cuc D exerts multi-focal action in pancreatic cancer cells targeting multiple signaling events. Overall, this study suggests that Cuc D can be a potential and promising therapeutic modality for pancreatic cancer treatment.","title":"A multi-targeted approach for pancreatic cancer treatment by a novel cucurbitacin analogue","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2714"}
