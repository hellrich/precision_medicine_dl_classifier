In this study, we analysed the clinical characteristics, including bronchoscopic findings, of patients with EML4-ALK-positive adenocarcinoma and compared them with those of EGFR mutation-positive patients.\nIn this retrospective cohort study, the clinical characteristics and bronchoscopic findings of patients with ALK fusion-positive lung cancers were compared to patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers.\nAmong the 440 patients with adenocarcinoma of lung screened for this study, 46 (10.4%) harboured the EML4-ALK fusion, 90 (20.4%) harboured an activating EGFR mutation, and all had adenocarcinoma. In univariate analysis, ALK-positive patients were significantly younger than EGFR-positive patients (p \u003d 0.004) and were more commonly male (p \u003d 0.021). An initial status of stage IV metastatic cancer was more frequently noted in EML4-ALK-positive patients (p \u003d 0.012), with initial brain metastasis frequently observed (p \u003d 0.007). Compared with EGFR-positive patients, EML4-ALK-positive patients were significantly more likely to have positive bronchoscopic findings, which suggested a more centralized origin (p \u003d 0.001). EML4-ALK patients also had significantly more positive bronchoscopic findings and were more commonly male in multivariate analysis.\nThe EML4-ALK fusion defines a new molecular subset of NSCLC that has distinct clinical and bronchoscopic findings suggesting more proximal origin when compared to tumours harbouring EGFR mutations.","title":"Comparison of clinical characteristics between patients with ALK-positive and EGFR-positive lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24361161"}
