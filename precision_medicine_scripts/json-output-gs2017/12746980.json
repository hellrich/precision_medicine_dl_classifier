A set of 40 features descriptive of the spatial and statistical distribution of nuclear chromatin was computed for each nucleus. Signatures were created for both types of tissue, and a distance metric from \"normal\" was defined and calculated for them.\nThere were significant differences in 11 features between the 2 groups, allowing the creation of digital signatures.\nNuclear chromatin texture signature can offer a specific digital characterization for both pancreatic adenocarcinoma and nonmalignant pancreatic tissue. Several isolated nuclear features serve as markers for the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The present karyometric study of normal and malignant pancreatic tissue may be of use as a continuing tool to early diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma as it can be applied to cytologic specimens, also. In the future, studies using this technique should assess the chemopreventive potential of different agents as well as prognosis and treatment options for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"Digital karyometry in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"12746980"}
