As such, little is known about current national practice patterns and MMT treatment sequencing for patients with gastric cancer. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of  T2 and/or node positive gastric cancer patients treated with MMT using the National Cancer Database (2006-2012). Patients were categorized based on type of MMT (chemotherapy, concurrent chemoradiation (cXRT), or both chemotherapy and cXRT) and treatment sequence (preoperative, postoperative, or perioperative). Accuracy of pre-treatment clinical nodal staging was ascertained by comparison to pathologic nodal staging in patients treated with upfront surgery. Multivariable Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between overall risk of death and MMT type and sequence. Results: Among 4,857 patients, 14.1% were treated perioperatively, 48.0% preoperatively, and 37.9% postoperatively. Rates of chemotherapy, cXRT, and both chemotherapy and cXRT were 32.1%, 53.4%, and 14.5%. Among patients treated with upfront surgery, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of clinical nodal staging were 70.7%, 88.8%, 92.1%, and 62.2%, respectively. Over the study period, use of cXRT decreased (61.8% 2006 vs 52.0% 2012; trend test, p \u003c 0.001) while use of chemotherapy increased (23.6% vs 35.7%; trend test, p \u003c 0.001) and use of both chemotherapy and cXRT did not change. There was an increase in the use of perioperative treatment (8.1% vs 17.4%; trend test, p \u003c 0.001) while postoperative treatment decreased (44.4% vs 31.1%; trend test, p \u003c 0.001). After multivariable modeling, neither type of MMT nor treatment sequence was associated with risk of death. Conclusions: Although current national practice patterns favor pre- and perioperative treatment, one third of patients were treated with upfront surgery. Survival was not associated with MMT type or sequence. However, given the high false negative rate of clinical nodal staging and high non-completion rate of postoperative treatment (50% in MAGIC trial), efforts to improve gastric cancer outcomes should focus on increasing use of preoperative therapy.","title":"Trends in multimodality therapy for gastric cancer post-MAGIC.","pubmedId":"ASCO_176667-195"}
