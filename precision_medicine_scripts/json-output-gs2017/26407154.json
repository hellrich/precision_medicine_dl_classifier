The purpose of the current study was to analyze the association between CYP17A1 T27C (rs743572) and LEP -2548G\u003eA (rs7799039) gene polymorphisms and breast cancer.\n199 breast cancer patients and 197 healthy controls were included in the study. The CYP17A1 and LEP gene polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.\nNo statistically significant association was found between these polymorphisms and breast cancer risk among a Turkish population. However, stratified analysis of these polymorphisms in relation to different clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer revealed an association between breast cancer diagnosis and the CYP17A1 T27C polymorphism (p \u003d 0.024).\nOur study suggests no strong association between the CYP17A1 T27C and LEP -2548G\u003eA polymorphisms and the incidence of breast cancer in Turkish women. The potential association between CYP17A1 T27C and the type of breast cancer deserves further consideration.","title":"Evaluation of CYP17A1 and LEP Gene Polymorphisms in Breast Cancer.","pubmedId":"26407154"}
