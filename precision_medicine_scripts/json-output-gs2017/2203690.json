Our aim was to test how the expression of the ras oncogene would influence the estradiol sensitivity of MCF-7 cells. In culture, MCF-7 cells expressing the viral p21 oncogene product, as compared to parental MCF-7 cells and their control derivatives, showed lower levels of a 67-kDa estrogen receptor. Progesterone receptors, however, remained sensitive to up-regulation by estrogens. The oncogene-expressing cells were less sensitive than all controls to stimulation of proliferation by 10(-8)M estradiol or to inhibition of proliferation by 2-CH3-4-OH tamoxifen, and this was not dependent upon the type of culture medium used. After s.c. or i.p. injection into female athymic nude mice, ovariectomized or left intact, the growth of MCF-7 cells expressing the ras oncogene product and of all control cells was sensitive to stimulation by estrogen supplementation. Conversely, cell lines derived from tumors generated with long latency in untreated athymic nude mice by v-ras-expressing MCF-7 cells showed efficient formation of quickly growing tumors in the absence of estrogen supplementation. No differences were observed in invasion and metastasis of the different MCF-7 cell types injected into athymic nude mice that were supplemented with estrogens or not.","title":"Hormone sensitivity in vitro and in vivo of v-ras-transfected MCF-7 cell derivatives.","pubmedId":"2203690"}
