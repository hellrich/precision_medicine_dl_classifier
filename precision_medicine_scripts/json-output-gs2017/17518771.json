One of 22 (4.5%) SN tested showed an HRAS G61L mutation. Another lesion, a \u0027halo\u0027 SN, showed a BRAF V600E (T1796A) mutation. BRAF V600E mutations were found in two thirds (20/31) of CBN, while a further 19% (6/31) showed NRAS codon 61 mutations. One third of CMM (10/30) had various BRAF mutations of codon 600, and a further 6% (2/31) showed NRAS codon 61 mutations. Seventeen SN tested for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 9p and 10q regions, known to be frequently deleted in melanoma, showed LOH at the 9p loci D9S942 and IFNA. A further lesion was found with low-level microsatellite instability at one locus, D10S214. The low rate of RAS-RAF mutations (2/22, 9.1%) observed in SN suggests that these lesions harbor as yet undetected activating mutations in other components of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAPK pathway. Germline DNA from members of 111 multiple-case melanoma families, representing a range of known (CDKN2A) and unknown predisposing gene defects, was analyzed for germline BRAF mutations, but none was found.","title":"Low prevalence of RAS-RAF-activating mutations in Spitz melanocytic nevi compared with other melanocytic lesions.","pubmedId":"17518771"}
