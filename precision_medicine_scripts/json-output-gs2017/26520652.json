Incidence of intraductal spread of pancreatic cancer (IS), distance from the tumor edge, direction of IS and clinicopathological factors associated with the presence of IS were retrospectively examined with data from IDC patients who underwent radical surgery.\nAmong 260 IDC patients who underwent surgery, 184 eligible cases, IS was identified in 42 patients (22.8%) and mean length of IS was 18.7 ± 21.6 mm. Mean distances on the ampullary and distal sides of IS were 11.1 mm and 11.6 mm. IS was significantly more frequent in localized tumors (UICC T1-2 vs. 3-4, p \u003d 0.007), with tumor diameter ≤2 cm (p \u003d 0.034) and in cases with scarce microscopic perineural invasion (p \u003d 0.047). Among patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy, IS presence (11.6 vs. 21.8%), mean distance to the contralateral side (11.4 vs. 11.6 mm), and IS ≥ 2 cm (3.3 vs. 4.7%) showed no significant differences. Overall survival did not differ significantly between IS-positive and -negative patients in the full analysis set or propensity score-matched patients (42 matched pairs).\nIn setting resectional margins at 2 cm, a small proportion of cases (3.8%) showed positive surgical margins. Localized tumor (UICC: T1-2, or \u003c2 cm in diameter) requires more care with surgical margins, warranting intraoperative frozen sections.","title":"Surgical and oncological impact of main pancreatic duct spread in invasive ductal adenocarcinoma: A clinicopathological study of 184 resected cases.","pubmedId":"26520652"}
