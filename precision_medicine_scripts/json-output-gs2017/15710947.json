Expressions of phosphorylated (p) -Akt and p-Erk were determined via immunohistochemistry. Response rate, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival were compared between each group according to EGFR mutation, as well as p-Akt and p-Erk expression.\nSeventeen patients (18.9%; 95% CI, 10.8 to 27.0) harbored EGFR mutations. These mutations include deletions in exon 19 in seven patients, L858R in six patients, G719A in three patients, and a novel A859T in one patient. Response rate in patients with EGFR mutation was 64.7% (11 of 17 patients; 95% CI, 42.0 to 87.4), in contrast to 13.7% (10 of 73 patients; 95% CI, 5.8 to 21.6) in patients without mutation (P \u003c .001). Moreover, these 17 patients with EGFR mutation had significantly prolonged TTP (21.7 v 1.8 months; P \u003c .001) and overall survival (30.5 v 6.6 months; P \u003c .001) compared with the remaining 73 patients without mutation. Although no significant correlation was detected between EGFR mutation and expressions of p-Akt or p-Erk, p-Akt overexpression was associated with prolonged TTP in patients with EGFR mutation.\nOur data further support the importance of EGFR mutation with regard to gefitinib sensitivity. In addition to its predictive role, EGFR mutation confers significant survival benefits on NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib.","title":"Predictive and prognostic impact of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib.","pubmedId":"15710947"}
