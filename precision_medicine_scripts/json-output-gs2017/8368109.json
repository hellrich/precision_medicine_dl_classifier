It tends to grow around blood vessels. Most of them have a low level of malignancy and relapses tend to be localized. Metastasis, when present, occur through the haematological route, lymph spread being very unusual. Pre-operative diagnosis is infrequent and overall prognosis is good. The choice treatment is radical orchidectomy, while long-term follow-up of these patients is mandatory. When local relapses become evident, the choice treatment is extensive local excision, followed by optional adjuvant radiotherapy. Chemotherapy has not proven to be effective. This paper reviews the current literature and contributes one case of mixed liposarcoma of the spermatic cord.","title":"[Paratesticular tumor.
