Growth inhibition by the p16-derived peptide was observed in a time- and dose-dependent manner in AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells (p16-negative and pRb-positive), whereas Saos-2 cells (p16-positive and pRb-negative) showed no inhibitory effect. In AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells, the proportion of cells in the G(1) phase markedly increased 48 h after treatment with 20 microM p16-derived peptide. Cell-cycle analysis of Saos-2 cells showed little change during the entire period of treatment. Immunoblot analysis showed inhibition of pRb phosphorylation after treatment of BxPC-3 with 10 microM p16 peptide. Furthermore, the p16 peptide caused a decrease in cyclin A at later times of treatment. These results demonstrate that the p16-derived peptide can inhibit the growth of p16-negative and pRb-positive pancreatic cancer cells by means of G(1) phase cell cycle arrest resulting from the inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. Restoration of p16/pRb tumor-suppressive pathway by re-expression of p16(INK4A) may play a therapeutic role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Inhibition of pRb phosphorylation and cell cycle progression by an antennapedia-p16(INK4A) fusion peptide in pancreatic cancer cells.","pubmedId":"10996726"}
