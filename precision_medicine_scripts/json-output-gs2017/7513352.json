The angiogenin gene was expressed in eight of the ten cases of colonic adenocarcinoma and in all of the four cases where dysplastic glands were found. Angiogenin expression was evident in four of the seven cases of gastric adenocarcinoma. bFGF expression was detected in only five of the seven gastric carcinoma cases. The mRNAs for angiogenin and bFGF were mainly cytoplasmic in distribution and were only occasionally seen in the nuclei of the positive cells. Neither the angiogenin gene mRNA nor the bFGF mRNA was expressed in the four cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. It is postulated that the angiogenin gene may play an important role in angiogenesis in colonic adenocarcinomas; in gastric cancers, both angiogenin and bFGF were involved in this process. For hepatocellular carcinomas, neither angiogenin nor bFGF production appeared to be related to angiogenesis.","title":"The observation of angiogenin and basic fibroblast growth factor gene expression in human colonic adenocarcinomas, gastric adenocarcinomas, and hepatocellular carcinomas.","pubmedId":"7513352"}
