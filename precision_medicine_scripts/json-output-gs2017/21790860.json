The parental tumor showed high leukemoid reactions. The NDDLS-1 cell line was established from a pleural effusion associated with a lung metastasis. Pleomorphic tumor cells arranged in a haphazard growth pattern were seen in xenograft tumors. Numerous inflammatory cells including neutrophils or eosinophils were present throughout the tumor cells. This finding resembled the dedifferentiated area of the parental tumor. The mice bearing NDDLS-1 showed marked leukocytosis. In addition, the NDDLS-1 cells expressed IL-6 and G-CSF at both the mRNA and protein levels, while the NDDLS-1 cells produced near normal levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). In the cytogenetic analysis, both the parental tumor and the NDDLS-1 cells showed a ring or giant marker chromosomes. The NDDLS-1 cell line demonstrated the amplification and expression of both MDM2 and CDK4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis. The NDDLS-1 cell line is consistent with the parental dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and it should therefore be useful for further investigations of human dedifferentiated liposarcomas.","title":"Establishment and characterization of a novel dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line, NDDLS-1.","pubmedId":"21790860"}
