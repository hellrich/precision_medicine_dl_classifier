The formation of relieving transversostomy is suggested as a method for the prevention of early postoperative complications resulting from incompetence of the anastomosis. It was formed in 51.3% of cases. Besides, for preventing incompetence of sigmoidorectal anastomoses, connecting antimicrobial elements with kanmycin, dioxydin, and cephamezin were applied in 27 patients (26.2%). Incompetence of the anastomosis was not encountered in such cases. Complications occurred in the immediate postoperative period in 45 patients (40.5%), 14 of them (12.6%) had incompetence of the anastomosis suture. There were no fatal outcomes. The authors believe relieving transversostomy to be expedient mainly in low resection of the rectum and in patients with partial obstruction of the large intestine.","title":"[Prevention of incompetence of sigmoid-rectal anastomosis after frontal resection of rectum in the treatment of cancer].","pubmedId":"7723261"}
