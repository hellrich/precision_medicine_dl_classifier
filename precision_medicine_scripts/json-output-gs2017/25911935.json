PC is the most fatal disease that kills about 95% of patients. Among the known risk factors for PC only for smoking, obesity, and family history a positive association with the PC risk in meta-analyzes confirmed. The PC etiology remains unclear, more than 90% of patients acquire it sporadically. Currently, the most significant genes for PC include KRAS2, p16/CDKN2, TP53, SMAD4/DPC4. Mutations in the KRAS noted in 90% of cases of pancreatic ducts adenocarcinoma. p16/CDKN2A mutation is accompanied by a 38-fold increased risk of PC compared with the general population. TP53 mutations are associated not only with carcinogenesis but also PC metastasis, as well as SMAD4/DPC4 mutations. Study of the role of genetic aspects in the PC development is necessary both to identify individuals with high PC risk, as well as for the development of gene-specific treatments, such as inhibitors of proteins, histone deacetylase, and histone acetyltransferase (vorinostat, belinostat, entinostat, panobinostat, curcumin) are in clinical trials.","title":"[Genetic aspects of pancreatic cancer].","pubmedId":"25911935"}
