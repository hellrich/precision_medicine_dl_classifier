This study evaluated the activity and tolerability of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) as a second-line therapy in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma pretreated with a gemcitabine-based regimen.\nA retrospective survey was carried out on 18 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who had been on gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and were then treated with FOLFIRINOX as a second-line therapy.\nOne patient (5.6%) had a confirmed complete response, 4 (22.2%) had confirmed partial responses and 5 (27.8%) had stable disease, resulting in a rate of disease control of 55.6% (95% CI, 33.3-77.8%). The median progression-free survival and median survival were 2.8 months and 8.4 months, respectively. Seven patients (38.9%) experienced grade 3-4 neutropenia. Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic adverse events included nausea (38.9%) and vomiting (16.7%).\nThese results suggest the modest clinical activity regarding efficacy and the acceptable toxicity profile with the FOLFIRINOX regimen as a second-line treatment.","title":"5-Fluorouracil/leucovorin combined with irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) as second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have progressed on gemcitabine-based therapy.","pubmedId":"24457620"}
