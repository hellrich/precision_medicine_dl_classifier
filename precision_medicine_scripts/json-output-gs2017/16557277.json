The identification of factors involved in the pathogenesis and progression of biliary tract carcinoma is critical for devising effective methods of screening and treatment. Recent evidence suggests that reduction of the length of telomeres, which normally help maintain chromosomal stability, may promote the development and progression of a variety of carcinomas. Using a novel, recently validated telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization method, we examined telomere length in normal and inflamed gallbladder epithelium, metaplasia and dysplasia of the gallbladder, and biliary tract carcinoma to determine whether telomere shortening is associated with neoplastic progression in the biliary tract. Although normal and inflamed gallbladder epithelium demonstrated uniform normal telomere lengths, over half of all metaplastic lesions demonstrated shortened telomeres, supporting prior evidence that metaplastic lesions of the gallbladder are pre-neoplastic. Dysplastic epithelium and invasive carcinomas demonstrated almost universally abnormally short telomeres, indicating that telomere shortening occurs at an early, preinvasive stage of cancer development. In addition, invasive adenocarcinoma of the biliary tract frequently demonstrated intratumoral heterogeneity of telomere lengths. We conclude that telomere shortening is a consistent and early finding in the development of biliary tract carcinoma.","title":"Telomere length variation in biliary tract metaplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16557277"}
