The majority of GISTs show gain-of-function KIT mutations. However, GISTs without KIT mutations and GISTs with weak or lack of immunohistochemical KIT expression have also been reported. Recently, gain-of-function mutations in exon 18 (activation loop) and exon 12 (juxtamembrane domain) of the PDGFRA were identified in such tumors. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that PDGFRA mutation may define a specific clinicopathologic subgroup of GISTs. A total of 447 KIT exon 11 (juxtamembrane domain) mutation-negative GISTs were studied. DNA samples were obtained from formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Genomic sequences of PDGFRA exons 18 and 12 were evaluated for the mutations by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. PDGFRA exon 18 mutations were identified in 122 of 346 (35.3%) gastric GISTs and two of 75 (2.7%) intestinal GISTs. A great majority of these mutations represented simple T to A missense mutation at the codon 842 leading to substitution of the valine for aspartic acid (D842 V). However, in-frame deletions and deletions with point mutations clustering between codons 841-847 were found in approximately 23% of all exon 18 mutations. Mutations in PDGFRA exon 12 were found only in 10 of 170 (5.8%) gastric and one of 54 (1.9%) intestinal GISTs negative for KIT exon 11 and PDGFRA exon 18 mutations. There were seven substitutions of aspartic acid for valine at codon 561 (V561D) and four in-frame deletions with point mutations clustering between codons 566 and 571. The majority of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations had pure or predominant epithelioid morphology. Low mitotic activity, \u003c or \u003d5 mitoses/50HPF was detected in 81% of analyzed GISTs including larger, \u003e5 cm tumors. Based on long-term follow-up (average 135 months), a majority (83.5%) of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations followed a benign course.","title":"A great majority of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations represent gastric tumors of low or no malignant potential.","pubmedId":"15146165"}
