Here we present a patient diagnosed with both a malignant neoplasm in the lung and a right upper extremity (RUE) neoplasm of unclear histogenetic origin. Immunohistochemical staining performed on the latter specimen was inconclusive in determining the site of origin. Although the lung biopsy sample was insufficient for molecular testing, hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (FoundationOne) identified an EML4-ALK rearrangement in the RUE lesion. Crizotinib treatment resulted in a major response in both the RUE and the lung lesions. This report illustrates the utility of comprehensive genomic profiling employed at the initial presentation of an unknown primary malignant neoplasm, which resulted in the front-line use of targeted therapy and a significant and sustained antitumor response.
