For example, 5-FU, Doxorubicin, MMC and Epirubicin obtained only 15-24% efficacy, and general combination chemotherapy was FAM, 5-FU+CDDP and 5-FU+Leucovorin for pancreatic cancer. Generally, in pancreatic cancer cases the performance status was poor, and most could not endure the chemotherapy regimen. 5-FU continuous infusion and low-dose CDDP regimen were effective and showed fewer side effects for pancreatic cancer. Then, for 2 cases of advanced pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis, 5-FU continuous infusion + low-dose CDDP + intermittent CPT-11 administration (5-FU 500 mg/body/24 hr + CDDP 5mg x 5 days-6 courses + CPT-11 100 mg-125 mg-150 mg, bolus i.v. intermittently) was effective. Thus, this regimen could well be effective for advanced pancreatic carcinoma.","title":"[Effect of combination chemotherapy of low-dose CDDP.
