Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene status was known in roughly half of the patients who had KRAS WT.\nTwo hundred four patients were included. Among them, the 77 individuals carrying a KRAS-mutant phenotype experienced a significantly inferior outcome in terms of response rate (P \u003d .04), disease control rate (P \u003d .05), and progression-free survival (PFS) (P \u003d .05) compared with the EGFR WT/KRAS WT population. The association between KRAS mutation and shorter PFS remained statistically significant at multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.45). In addition, patients with KRAS mutations reported a significantly shorter overall survival (OS) compared with patients with EGFR WT/KRAS WT/ALK negativity (n \u003d 64) (P \u003d .02). Among patients with KRAS mutations, those harboring a mutation at codon 13 (n \u003d 12) performed worse than those with a mutation at codon 12 (n \u003d 62) in terms of both PFS and OS (P \u003d .09 for both).\nKRAS mutation appears to negatively affect sensitivity to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced nonsquamous EGFR WT NSCLC. Studies on larger case series are needed to address differences in clinical outcome according to the type of mutation.","title":"Clinical outcome with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced nonsquamous EGFR wild-type non-small-cell lung cancer segregated according to KRAS mutation status.","pubmedId":"24139827"}
