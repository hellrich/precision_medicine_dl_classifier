Three areas that showed different levels of HER2 protein expression were chosen, and silver in situ hybridization was performed.\nHER2 regional and genetic heterogeneity was found in 6.2% and 6.8% of tumors, respectively. Both types of heterogeneity were significantly associated with hormone receptor positivity, HER2 immunohistochemistry score of 2+, a low level of HER2 gene amplification, and absence of an extensive intraductal component. Genetic heterogeneity also showed strong correlation with a lower histologic grade. In the hormone receptor-positive group, the regional heterogeneity affected disease-free survival of patients (hazard ratio, 4.869; 95% confidence interval, 1.424-16.646; P \u003d .005), whereas genetic heterogeneity did not.\nEvaluation of intratumoral heterogeneity, especially in cases with hormone receptor positivity, may be valuable for assessing the prognosis of HER2-positive patients anticipating treatment with adjuvant systemic therapy and trastuzumab.","title":"Clinicopathologic Significance of the Intratumoral Heterogeneity of HER2 Gene Amplification in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Adjuvant Trastuzumab.","pubmedId":"26386078"}
