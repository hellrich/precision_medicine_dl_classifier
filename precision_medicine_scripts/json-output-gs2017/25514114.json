The influence of afatinib/gefitinib on cell viability and cell cycle was evaluated in isogenic SW48 KRAS wild-type/mutant cells. Protein levels of phosphorylated/total EGFR, HER-2, HER-3, ERK, and AKT were compared between treated/untreated samples using western blotting. The activity of both afatinib and gefitinib was the lowest in KRAS G12C/G12S/G12D and the highest in G13D/G12A mutant subtypes. A 50% decrease in cell viability was achieved at concentrations of 3.0-7.7 μmol/l for afatinib and 5.4-19.5 μmol/l for gefitinib. The effect of both drugs on apoptosis appeared to be stronger than their influence on proliferation and was generally less pronounced in mutant cells than in wild-type cells. The average number of apoptotic cells after treatment with afatinib was 2.6 times as high as the corresponding value following treatment with gefitinib (P\u003c0.01). Levels of pEGFR, pHER-2, pERK, and pAKT were reduced more extensively by afatinib than by gefitinib (P\u003c0.001). Some KRAS mutations (G12C/G12S/G12D) appear to weaken the activity of afatinib and gefitinib whereas others seem to increase sensitivity to treatment (G13D/G12A) compared with the parental clone (KRAS wild-type). In SW48 colorectal cancer cells, afatinib seems to be more potent than gefitinib because of its superior efficacy in inhibiting both EGFR and HER-2, suppressing signaling along both MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways to a greater extent.
