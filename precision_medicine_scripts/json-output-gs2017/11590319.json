For the carcinoma, the LI averaged 46.0+/-20.9, which was significantly higher than that for normal duct epithelia (p \u003c 0.0001) and cystadenoma (16.0 11.2; p \u003d 0.0007). However, it was significantly reduced in cases with stage IV disease (p \u003d 0.0351), lymph node metastasis (p \u003d 0.0003), larger size (p \u003d 0.0094), capsular invasion (p \u003d 0.0462), lymphatic invasion (p \u003d 0.0351), and cell proliferating activity (p \u003d 0.0002). In multivariate analysis, p57 LI in pancreatic adenocarcinoma was independently linked to high proliferating activity (p \u003d 0.0230).\nThese results suggest that p57 plays a role in the hyperplastic change of the ducts in chronic pancreatitis and that pS7 overexpression contributes to the downregulation of cell proliferation, and its decreased expression contributes to the progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"Expression of p57/Kip2 protein in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"11590319"}
