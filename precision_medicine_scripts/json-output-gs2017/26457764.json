In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the recognition of oncogenic activation of specific RTKs, has led to the development of molecularly targeted agents that only benefit roughly 20% of patients. Entrectinib is a pan-TRK, ROS1 and ALK inhibitor that has shown potent anti-neoplastic activity and tolerability in various neoplastic conditions, particularly NSCLC.\nThis review outlines the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action, safety, tolerability, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of entrectinib, a promising novel agent for the treatment of advanced solid tumors with molecular alterations of Trk-A, B and C, ROS1 or ALK.\nAmong the several experimental drugs under clinical development, entrectinib is emerging as an innovative and promising targeted agent. The encouraging antitumor activity reported in the Phase 1 studies, together with the acceptable toxicity profile, suggest that entrectinib, thanks to its peculiar mechanism of action, could play an important role in the treatment-strategies of multiple TRK-A, B, C, ROS1, and ALK- dependent solid tumors, including NSCLC and colorectal cancer. That being said, further evidence for its clinical use is still needed.","title":"Entrectinib: a potent new TRK, ROS1, and ALK inhibitor.","pubmedId":"26457764"}
