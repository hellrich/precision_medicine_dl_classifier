The lesion was characterised by large bullae with its inner configuration resembling placental chorionic villi macroscopically and merging imperceptibly with adjacent normal lung tissue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report from India and South Asia. Awareness of this rare entity helps make a definite diagnosis. Surgery alone is curative and not conservative management as prescribed for emphysema.","title":"A case report of pulmonary placental transmogrification with review of literature.","pubmedId":"16696531"}
