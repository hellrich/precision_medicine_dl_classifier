The Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) tested for the presence of 10 driver mutations in over 1,000 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung.  Methods:  Tumor specimens were assessed for diagnosis and adequacy; multiplexed genotyping utilizing SNaPshot or Sequenom was performed, and mutations were recorded in GeneInsight database. We reviewed the LCMC database for patients tested for HER2 mutations and accessed clinical characteristics, including age and stage at diagnosis, sex, smoking status, treatment history, sites of metastatic disease, and vital status. We conducted an exploratory analysis to compare survival of HER2 mutated patients treated with HER2 targeted therapies to those who did not receive targeted therapies.  Results:  Of the 920 patients tested for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) mutation, 24 patients (2.6%) had exon 20 insertion mutations. The mutation was located at exon 20 insertion at codon 775 in all patients; 1 patient also had concurrent MET amplification. The median age was 62 (37-84) and the majority were never smokers (71%). Nearly 70% had advanced stage disease at the time of diagnosis. There was a slight predominance of females (n\u003d14) over males (n\u003d10). The median survival for patients that received HER2 targeted therapies (n\u003d12) or not (n\u003d12) was 18.3 months and 16.4 months respectively. HER2- targeted therapies included dacomitinib (n\u003d5), dacomitinib and crizotinib (n\u003d1), neratinib (n\u003d2), trastuzumab (n\u003d1), lapatanib and trastuzumab (n\u003d1), and STA-9090 (n\u003d1). At last assessment of vital status, 50% (6/12) of the patients treated with targeted therapy were alive as compared to only 33% (4/12) of the remainder. The overall survival for HER2 mutated patients was worse than that for overall LCMC cohort in which median survival with genotype directed therapies was 3.5 years versus 2.4 years without targeted therapy.  Conclusions:  HER2 mutations were detected in 2.6% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. There was a favorable survival trend among patients that received HER2 targeted therapies.","title":"HER2 mutations in lung adenocarcinoma: A report from the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_133889-144"}
