The carcinogenesis and development of lung cancer are related to activation and inactivation of many oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. We reported c-myc activation by translocation in SV40T-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells and lung cancer cell line before. In order to confirm that c-myc translocation exists in human primary non-small cell lung cancer, we continued our studies in 12 primary human lung cancers.\nWe applied major fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in combination with immunohistochemistry.\nc-myc translocation was detected in two cases of the 12 primary lung cancers. Overexpression of c-myc was detected in the two cases by means of immunohistochemistry.\nThese results suggest that c-myc can be activated by translocation in human primary lung cancer.","title":"[C-myc activation by translocation in human primary non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"8758273"}
