NO is produced by nitric oxide synthases (NOS). There are three enzyme isoforms: two of them are constitutively produced (neuronal or brain NOS and endothelial NOS), and one is an inducible form (iNOS). NOS expression has been shown in several epithelial tumors, but there is no report addressing NOS expression in sarcomas. The authors evaluated the expression of NOS in 97 cases of various sarcomas spotted in duplicate in a tissue array paraffin block. Eighty-four of the 97 tumor specimens (86.6%) expressed nNOS, and most of them showed a strong expression of the isoenzyme. Only chondrosarcomas and liposarcomas had significant numbers of negative cases, and all pleomorphic sarcomas, alveolar soft part sarcomas, angiosarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and synovial sarcomas showed some degree of positivity. Forty-three cases (44.4%) showed eNOS immunostaining, but only 15.5% showed a strong signal, with emphasis on angiosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, alveolar soft part sarcomas, and synovial sarcoma. Strong expression of iNOS was observed in only 9 cases (9.3%), with weak expression in another 26 cases (26.8%). Strong expression of iNOS was found in malignant peripheral nerve sheet tumors, liposarcomas, pleomorphic sarcomas, fibrosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, and synovial sarcomas. Apparently alveolar soft part sarcomas are unusual in their capacity of expression of NOS isoforms, and in a very peculiar pattern. In conclusion, sarcomas in general commonly express constitutive NOS, and only a few types of sarcomas can express iNOS, the isoenzymes capable of releasing large amounts of NO. More comprehensive studies should be performed to better understand the clinical importance of NOS expression and NO production in sarcomas.","title":"Sarcomas often express constitutive nitric oxide synthases (NOS) but infrequently inducible NOS.","pubmedId":"17122636"}
