Breast cancer patients, prior to ACM had extensive cytotoxic and hormonal treatments, gastric cancer patients received ACM as a first chemotherapeutic tumor treatment. No life-threatening hematologic toxicities could be noticed. All patients experienced moderate to severe gastrointestinal toxicities. No patient had considerable hair loss. 4 patients showed clinical signs of cardiac dysfunction: 1 ECG changes, 4 developed edema of lower extremities, 2 developed pericardial effusion. Moreover, 1 patient developed significant elevation of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCW) and prolongation of the systolic time intervals indicating pulmonary congestion grade I to II (Braunwald). No significant increase in heart volume was registered. Clear signs of cardiotoxicity could be demonstrated in patients pretreated with adriamycin exclusively. In animal experience, ACM had been reported as less cardiotoxic as compared to adriamycin. Present studies seem to indicate ACM being considerably cardiotoxic at relatively low cumulative dosages. Among the 15 patients there was one with metastatic breast cancer pretreated with adriamycin and resistant to that drug in whom partial remission was achieved. The other patients did not objectively respond to ACM therapy. 3 out of 5 patients with gastric cancer had stabilisation of the disease but no objective response.","title":"[Pilot studies with aclacinomycin in patients with breast cancer or gastrointestinal tumors].","pubmedId":"6868630"}
