The entire coding region of the STK11 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by direct sequencing.\nA novel mutation, c.904C \u003e T, in exon 7 was identified in both families. A C \u003e T substitution changed codon 302 from CAG (glutamine) to TAG (stop), truncating the STK11 protein, thus leading to the partial loss of the kinase domain and complete loss of the Î±-helix C-terminus. Furthermore, one PJS patient from each family was diagnosed with a visceral cancer, a colon cancer and a liver cancer respectively.\nWe predict that this novel mutation, p.Q302X, is most likely responsible for development of the PJS phenotype and may even contribute to malignancy.","title":"A novel mutation in STK11 gene is associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome in Chinese patients.","pubmedId":"22168747"}
