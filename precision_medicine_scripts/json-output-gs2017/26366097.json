The correlation between sequential expression of multiple targets, and clinicopathologic factors and survival was analyzed.\nThe positive expression rates of PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR were 49%, 58%, and 56%, respectively. There were eleven cases with three biomarkers positive (19%), 22 cases with two biomarkers positive (37%), and 19 cases with only one biomarker positive (32%). Seven cases (12%) were all negative. Multi-factorial Cox regression analysis showed that neural invasion, vascular invasion, size of the tumor, lymph nodes affected, metastasis, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level, and PI3K/p-AKT/p-mTOR simultaneous expression were independent prognostic parameters. The risk of death for the cases with two biomarkers positive was 0.367 times that for the cases with three biomarkers positive (P\u003d0.166). The risk of death for the cases with only one biomarker positive was 0.105 times that for the cases with three biomarkers positive (P\u003d0.058). The risk of death for the cases with three biomarkers negative was 0.017 times that for the cases with three biomarkers positive (P\u003d0.022).\nOur study generated the hypothesis that patients with gastric cancer with simultaneous expression of PI3K/p-AKT/p-mTOR had worse outcome. But we need more rigorous validation in a larger data set.","title":"The expression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in gastric cancer and its role in gastric cancer prognosis.","pubmedId":"26366097"}
