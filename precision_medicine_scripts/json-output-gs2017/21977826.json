The patients were followed up for at leas one year.\n122 patients had normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and 238 patients had reduced left ventricular fraction. Patients with normal LVEF tended to be older and female and were more likely to have a history of hypertension whereas patients with reduced LVEF had a longer history of heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease. Seventy nine patients (21.9%) died. Patients with depressed ejection fraction had a higher death rate during follow up as compared with preserved ejection fraction.\nWe had demonstrated that echocardiography is a useful non-invasive tool for assessing patients with CHF due to systolic or diastolic dysfunction.","title":"The role of echocardiography in the management of patients with congestive heart failure. \"Tanzanian experience\".","pubmedId":"21977826"}
