While FISH was established as the gold standard for identifying these patients, there is accumulating evidence that other methods of detection, i.e., immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing (NGS), exist that may be equally successful. However, the concordance of these methods is under investigation.\nAdding to the current literature, we here report a 56Â year old female never-smoker with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma whose biopsy was IHC and FISH inconclusive but positive in NGS. Retroactive profiling of the resection specimen corroborated fusion reads obtained by NGS, FISH-positivity and showed weak ALK-positivity by IHC. Consequently, we diagnosed the case as ALK-positive rendering the patient eligible to crizotinib treatment.\nWith IHC on biopsy material only, this case would have been overlooked withholding effective therapy.","title":"Next-generation sequencing facilitates detection of the classic E13-A20 EML4-ALK fusion in an ALK-FISH/IHC inconclusive biopsy of a stage IV lung cancer patient: a case report.","pubmedId":"27863497"}
