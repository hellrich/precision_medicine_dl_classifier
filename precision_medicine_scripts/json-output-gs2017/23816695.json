Metabolic syndrome was defined according to 2004 Adult Treatment Panel-III criteria. Nutritional habits were assessed using 3-day food records.\nPrevalence of metabolic syndrome before orthotopic liver transplantation was 14/84 (16.6%); at 3, 6 and 12 months post-orthotopic liver transplantation it was 27/84 (32.1%), 30/84 (35.7%), and 32/81 (39.5%), respectively. Diabetes, family history of diabetes, and excess body weight at baseline independently correlated with incidence of metabolic syndrome. After orthotopic liver transplantation, patients with metabolic syndrome showed a higher increase in the intake of total energy and saturated fats and a higher prevalence of complications, especially cardiovascular events, than subjects without metabolic syndrome.\nOccurrence of metabolic syndrome is an early phenomenon after liver transplantation. Pre-operative and post-operative factors predispose patients to metabolic syndrome, which may be reduced by controlling modifiable risk factors, such as body weight and dietary intake.","title":"Metabolic syndrome after liver transplantation: short-term prevalence and pre- and post-operative risk factors.","pubmedId":"23816695"}
