Amplification of the c-erbB-2 gene is more frequent in carcinoma in situ than in invasive types. Detection by a PCR-based method may help diagnose non-palpable breast carcinoma with nipple discharge. Since this gene amplification is related to high proliferation, it might provide useful preoperative information regarding intraductal carcinoma of comedo type and predict responses to chemotherapy.","title":"Detection of c-erbB-2 gene amplification in nipple discharge by means of polymerase chain reaction.","pubmedId":"7749137"}
