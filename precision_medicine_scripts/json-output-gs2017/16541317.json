We computed weight change from 1 year prior to diagnosis to study enrollment. Delayed entry Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations of categories of weight change with time to recurrence, controlling for known prognostic factors.\nNeither moderate (5-10%) nor large (\u003e 10%) weight gain (HR 0.8, 95% CI, 0.6-1.1; HR 0.9, 95% CI, 0.7-1.2, respectively) after breast cancer diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence in the early years post-diagnosis (median time of 73.7 months from diagnosis).\nOur research provides evidence that weight gain commonly seen in the first several years following a breast cancer diagnosis does not increase a woman\u0027s risk for breast cancer recurrence in the first 5-7 years post-diagnosis. However, this research does not address the effects of weight gain on overall survival or on the risk of other new cancers, other prognostic outcomes of concern to the breast cancer survivor.","title":"Post-diagnosis weight gain and breast cancer recurrence in women with early stage breast cancer.","pubmedId":"16541317"}
