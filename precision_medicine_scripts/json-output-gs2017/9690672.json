The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (MMAC1) on chromosome 10q23 is mutated in approximately 30% of glioblastomas (WHO Grade IV). In this study, we assessed the frequency of PTEN mutations in primary glioblastomas, which developed clinically de novo, and in secondary glioblastomas, which evolved from low-grade (WHO Grade II) or anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO Grade III). Nine of 28 (32%) primary glioblastomas contained a PTEN mutation and an additional case showed a homozygous PTEN deletion. This indicates that after overexpression/amplification of the EGF receptor, loss of PTEN function is the most common alteration in primary glioblastomas. In this series, 5 of 28 (18%) primary glioblastomas showed both a PTEN mutation and EGFR amplification. In contrast, only 1 of 25 (4%) secondary glioblastomas contained a PTEN mutation, and none of them showed a homozygous PTEN deletion. The secondary glioblastoma with a PTEN mutation developed from an anaplastic astrocytoma that already carried the mutation. The observation that secondary glioblastomas have a p53 mutation as a genetic hallmark but rarely contain a PTEN mutation supports the concept that primary and secondary glioblastomas develop differently on a genetic level.","title":"PTEN (MMAC1) mutations are frequent in primary glioblastomas (de novo) but not in secondary glioblastomas.","pubmedId":"9690672"}
