Although we reported that production of endothelin-1 is increased in the failing heart in rats with CHF, it is not known whether production of endothelin-1 in the lung is altered by CHF.\nCongestive heart failure was induced by coronary artery ligation in rats. Expression of preproendothelin-1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in the lung and kidney was determined. Endothelin-1 staining (immunoreactivity) in the lung was studied by immunohistochemical analysis. Effects of long-term BQ-123 treatment on the rats were studied.\nTwo weeks postoperatively, CHF accompanied by pulmonary hypertension developed in the rats (CHF rats). Expression of preproendothelin-1 mRNA in the lung was markedly higher in the CHF rats than in the sham-operated rats, whereas that in the kidney did not differ between the two groups. Endothelin-1 staining on the pulmonary vascular endothelial cells was more intense in the CHF rats. BQ-123 treatment over a 2-week period in the CHF rats greatly reduced right ventricular systolic pressure and central venous pressure, but it did not affect blood pressure or left ventricular contractility (peak positive first derivative of left ventricular pressure) in these rats.\nLong-term BQ-123 treatment greatly ameliorated pulmonary hypertension in the CHF rats. The present study suggests that endothelin-1 plays an important role in the progression of pulmonary hypertension caused by CHF and that an endothelin receptor antagonist may be a new therapeutic agent for CHF-induced pulmonary hypertension.","title":"Pulmonary hypertension caused by congestive heart failure is ameliorated by long-term application of an endothelin receptor antagonist.
