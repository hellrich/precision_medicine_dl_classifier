Several studies reported that a new alternative chemotherapy, UFT/LV, had anti-cancer effects the same as with conventional 5-FU/LV therapy. We report a patient who had advanced and recurrent colorectal cancer treated with UFT/ LV. This 70-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of a right lower abdominal mass, which was diagnosed as a peritoneal recurrence of transverse colon cancer by abdominal CT. UFT/LV therapy was started on an outpatient basis. After one course of chemotherapy, the intra-abdominal mass disappeared, and this therapy was continued for three courses. He did not suffer from any adverse effect during chemotherapy. Although this therapy was resumed because of the recurrence at the same site after nine months, it was refractory to chemotherapy. Thereafter, surgical resection was performed, and it was diagnosed as lymph node metastasis of previous surgery.","title":"[A case of colorectal cancer effectively treated with UFT/LV].","pubmedId":"16184938"}
