Lymph node involvement is one of the major prognostic factors. Therefore, pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes dissection is a part of the surgical management of these patients. Isolated peripheral lymph node metastasis has not been previously reported as a finding of recurrence in EC. We report a 67-year-old woman with recurrent EC presented with an isolated cervical lymph node metastasis (ICLM). Following the combination chemotherapy of doxorubicin, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide, her cervical lymph node was completely regressed. To our knowledge, this is the first case of recurrent EC presented with ICLM. We suggest that for women with EC who had isolated peripheral lymphadenopathies, peripheral lymph node metastasis should be considered as the finding of recurrence in patient with EC.","title":"An unusual case of recurrent endometrial cancer presented with isolated cervical lymph node metastasis.","pubmedId":"19082834"}
