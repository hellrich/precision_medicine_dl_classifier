The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between their abnormalities and clinicopathological features in gastric carcinomas.\nImmunohistochemical analysis of the encoded proteins was performed on a series of 158 cases.\nLoss of p16/Rb protein (pRb) expression and overexpression of cyclin D1/CDK4 were observed in 49%/40% and 37%/37% of gastric carcinomas, respectively. At least 1 of these abnormalities was found in 86% of the cases and a positive correlation was noted between p16 and pRb (P \u003d 0.009). Cyclin D1 (P \u003d 0.042) and CDK4 (P \u003d 0.008) overexpession was inversely associated with lymph node metastasis and depth of invasion, respectively. Loss of pRb expression was more frequently in diffuse type lesions than in the intestinal type (P \u003d 0.022). The patients with p16+/pRb-/cyclin D1-/CDK4- or p16-/pRb+/cyclin D1-/CDK4- tumors demonstrated particularly poor survival. With multivariate survival analysis, only depth of invasion and TNM stage could be proven as independent predictors.\nThe Rb pathway is disrupted in the vast majority of gastric carcinomas. This study also identified specific immunohistochemical marker profiles for prognosis.","title":"Abnormal expression of p16(INK4a), cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and retinoblastoma protein in gastric carcinomas.","pubmedId":"18484097"}
