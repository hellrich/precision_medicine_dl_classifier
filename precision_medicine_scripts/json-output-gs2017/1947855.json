This rare tumour, which is slow growing and tends to recur locally, must be considered in the differential diagnosis of solid tumours between the testis and the internal ring. The surgical treatment is radical orchiectomy with wide local excision and high ligation of the spermatic cord. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is debatable and the value of chemo- and radiotherapy is uncertain.","title":"Liposarcoma of the spermatic cord. Case report.","pubmedId":"1947855"}
