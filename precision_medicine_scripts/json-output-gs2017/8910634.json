In the present study 221 cases of endometrioid endometrial carcinoma obtained from Japanese patients with average follow-up of 41 months were examined for point mutations in codon 12 of K-ras through use of the polymerase chain reaction. In 103 cases lymph node dissection had been performed. K-ras mutations were significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastases (P \u003c 0.04). Since endometrial carcinoma in premenopausal women generally behaves less aggressively than tumors of similar histologic grade arising in postmenopausal patients, we evaluated the effect of K-ras mutation on outcome in patients stratified into three different age categories (\u003c53 years, premenopausal; 54-59 years, perimenopausal; \u003e60 years, postmenopausal). In the postmenopausal age group (\u003e60 years), the presence of K-ras mutations was statistically significantly associated with patients who died or experienced recurrence (41.2% vs 13.0%; P \u003c 0.03). This was related to a dramatic (greater than eightfold; P \u003d 0.011) increase in the likelihood of adverse outcome between the premenopausal and postmenopausal states for patients whose tumors contained mutant K-ras. These findings point to a possible role for K-ras activation in the mechanism(s) responsible for more aggressive clinical behavior of endometrioid endometrial cancer that is observed in postmenopausal patients.","title":"K-ras point mutations in endometrial carcinoma: effect on outcome is dependent on age of patient.","pubmedId":"8910634"}
