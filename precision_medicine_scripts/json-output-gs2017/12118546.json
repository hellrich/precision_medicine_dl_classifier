Samples were taken from 16 patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma for the PCR analysis of mutated c-Ki-ras oncogene. Five tumor samples, 15 PB samples, and 3 PW samples were analyzed for point mutation of the c-Ki-ras gene at codon 12.\nOut of five tumor samples analyzed for c-Ki-ras mutation, four were positive at the 12th codon. Out of total 15 PB samples, nine were positive for the c-Ki-ras point mutation at the 12th codon. All the positive PB samples showed a base substitution from GGT to GAT in the second position of the 12th codon. Out of three PW samples, two showed mutation at the second position from GGT to GAT similar to their PB and tumor samples.\nOur study indicated the presence of the tumor cells (CMMC) in PB of pancreatic adenocarcinoma that can be identified by PCR analysis of c-Ki-ras oncogene. Patients with presence of CMMC in PB and mutation in PW had aggressive tumors that responded poorly to treatment.","title":"C-Ki-ras mutations in peripheral blood of pancreatic cancer patients: a marker for early tumor metastasis.","pubmedId":"12118546"}
