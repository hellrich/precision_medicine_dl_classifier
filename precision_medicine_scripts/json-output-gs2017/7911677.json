Paraffin embedded tissue samples were prepared from tumor material taken by biopsy prior to therapy as well as at surgery from patients of both groups to estimate the HER-2 oncogene copy numbers before and after treatment. In 53 and 50% of the pretherapeutic samples the HER-2 gene was amplified in groups A and B, respectively. In the post-therapeutic group 60% of the chemotherapy and 48% of the radiotherapy patients, respectively, had low or high HER-2 oncogene copy numbers. In addition, HER-2 amplification before and after therapy was estimated in 28 patients. An increase of oncogene copy numbers could be detected in 21% of the chemotherapy patients, and a decrease was noted in 11%. No radiotherapy patient showed a rise, but 11% a loss of copy numbers. Although amplification of HER-2 oncogene was not found to be associated with overall survival as it was in many studies before, it could still be a predictor of clinical outcome and the cause of mammary carcinomas developing into stage T3/4.","title":"Clinical therapy and HER-2 oncogene amplification in breast cancer: chemo- vs radiotherapy.","pubmedId":"7911677"}
