These mutations cluster in specific regions and confer sensitivity to inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. To further determine the genetic and molecular characteristics of tumors carrying EGFR gene mutations, we investigated the EGFR gene status in lung adenocarcinomas and evaluated its association with specific characteristics of the patients and tumors, such as mutations at KRAS and p53, EGFR and ErbB2 gene amplification, levels of EGFR and HER2 proteins, and levels of downstream effectors of EGFR, such as phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phospho-S6 proteins.\nThe mutational status of EGFR was determined by direct sequencing in 86 primary lung adenocarcinomas and 12 lung cancer cell lines, and was correlated with a number of variables relating to the tumor and patient. A tissue microarray containing 37 lung tumors was constructed to determine, by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, the number of copies of EGFR and ErbB2 genes and, by immunohistochemistry, the levels of EGFR, HER2, phospho-ERK, and phospho-S6 proteins.\nEGFR gene mutations were identified in 13% of the primary tumors. The type and clustering of the mutations were identical to those previously reported. Amplification of the EGFR occurred in 14% of the tumors and could arise in tumors with EGFR mutations. Interestingly, mTOR activation, as measured indirectly by augmented levels of phospho-S6 protein, was more frequent in tumors with gene alterations in either EGFR or KRAS (P \u003d 0.00005; Fisher\u0027s exact test) than in their wild-type counterparts.\nOur data agree with the accumulation of EGFR mutations in a subset of patients with lung cancer. Moreover, we report EGFR gene amplification in EGFR-mutant tumors and a positive correlation between EGFR or KRAS alterations and activation of mTOR signaling.","title":"Molecular context of the EGFR mutations: evidence for the activation of mTOR/S6K signaling.","pubmedId":"16467080"}
