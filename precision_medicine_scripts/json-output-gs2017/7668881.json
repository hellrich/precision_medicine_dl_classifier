Prognostic factors for cervical cancer include clinical stage, histological type, pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastasis and CPL classification of carcinoma. Prognostic factors for cancer of uterine corpus are concerned with clinical stage, histological type and histological differentiation, muscle invasion, lymph node metastasis, perineal washing cytology and so forth. The clinical stage of course, reflects the prognosis. Although one of the important prognostic factors is lymph no metastasis, there may be recurrence in patients with a poor prognosis in cases in which lymph node metastasis has not been observed. In order to distinguish such cases and to improve their prognosis, it is important to provide treatment individually but combined chemotherapy or radiation therapy, for example, with efforts to detect various prognostic factors.","title":"[Prognostic factors in uterine cervical and corpus cancer].","pubmedId":"7668881"}
