Therapeutic suppression of tissue reactivity: I. Comparison of the effects of cortisone and aminopterin. Am. J. Med. Sci. 221, 169-175; Gubner, R., August, S., Ginsberg, V., 1951. Therapeutic suppression of tissue reactivity: II. Effect of aminopterin in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Am. J. Med. Sci. 221, 176-182.]. Corticosteroids, and to some extent cyclophosphamide, took MTX out of the rheumatologist\u0027s armamentarium until the late 1970s-early 1980s when the toxic profile of these compounds became apparent. By the mid 1980s, four randomized clinical trials (RCTs) had proven beyond doubt the beneficial effects of MTX when administered to patients with established disease who had failed to respond to other compounds such as gold salts and D-penicillamine [Thompson, R.N., Watts, C., Edelman, J., Esdaile, J., and Russell, A.S., 1984.

Comparison of low-dose oral pulse methotrexate and placebo in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. A controlled clinical trial. Arthritis Rheum. 28, 721-730.]. Subsequently, these four trials were included in a meta-analysis and the drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in RA [Health and Public Policy Committee, H.P.P.C. and American College Physicians, A.C.P., 1987. Methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis. Ann. Intern. Med. 107, 418-419; Paulus, H.E., 1986.

Med. 107, 358-366.]. Since then, rheumatologists have become aware of what Pincus et al. have called \"the side effects\" of RA comparing the morbidity and mortality caused by RA with that potentially caused by medications used to treat this disease [Pincus, T. and Callahan, L.F., 1993. The \"side effects\" of rheumatoid arthritis: joint destruction, disability and early mortality. Br. J. Rheumatol. 32, 28-37.]. Thus, during the 1990s the use of MTX for the treatment of RA became generalized [O\u0027Dell, J.R., 1997. Methotrexate use in rheumatoid arthritis. Rheum. Dis. Clin.
