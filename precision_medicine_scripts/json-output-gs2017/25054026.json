Current diagnosis of cervical cancer depends on colposcopy, pathological diagnosis and preoperative diagnosis using methods, including magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Advanced cervical cancer has a poor prognosis. The tumor marker squamous cell carcinoma is conventionally used for screening, but recent studies have revealed the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and the factors associated with a poor prognosis in cervical cancer. These include epigenetic biomarkers, with the methylation level of the checkpoint with forkhead and ring finger gene being potentially useful for predicting the malignancy of cervical cancer and sensitivity to treatment with paclitaxel. The extent of methylation of the Werner DNA helicase gene is also useful for determining sensitivity to an anticancer agent, CPT-11. In addition to epigenetic changes, the expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α subunit, epidermal growth factor receptor and cyclooxygenase-2 have been reported as possible biomarkers in cervical cancer. Novel prognostic factors, including angiogenic factors, fragile histidine triad, thymidylate synthase, glucose-related protein 58 and mucin antigens, have also been described, and hemoglobin and platelets may also be significant prognostic biomarkers. Utilization of these biomarkers may facilitate personalized treatment and improved outcomes in cervical cancer.","title":"Candidate biomarkers for cervical cancer treatment: Potential for clinical practice (Review).","pubmedId":"25054026"}
