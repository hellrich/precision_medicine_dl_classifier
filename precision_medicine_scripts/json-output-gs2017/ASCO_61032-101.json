We developed an EGFR mutation gene expression signature to identify genes associated with the EGFR-dependent phenotype. Methods: Gene expression and EGFR status were measured in 95 adenocarcinomas (training set), two sets of lung adenocarcinomas (N\u003d102 and 82) and 53 NSCLC cell lines (testing sets). A proteomic profiling, generated by reverse phase protein array technology in 74 NSCLC cell lines, using 170 antibodies, was analyzed. MACC1 and MET immunostaining, of a tissue-microarray including 287 NSCLC, was studied. MACC1 knockdown experiments were conducted. Results: We identified a set of 45 genes significantly associated with EGFR status in the training set. The gene-set was used to compute a signature which was shown to be predictive of EGFR status in 3 testing sets. Pathway analysis of the genes showed that EGFR-mutations was marked by increased endocytosis and decreased mitosis genes. The signature was correlated with drug sensitivity to EGFR TKI in vitro, and significantly associated with survival in early stage adenocarcinomas, even in the subgroup with EGFR wild-type tumors. Our current study identified MACC1 as the most significantly up-regulated gene in EGFR mutant. MACC1 and MET expression levels, in vitro and in vivo, were highly correlated both at the mRNA and protein levels. A correlation heatmap of the proteomic profiling showed a strong correlation of MACC1 with MET, downstream signal transducers (STATs), markers of the epithelial phenotype (a classical feature of EGFR mutant tumors), and RAB25 (a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases that are involved in endocytosis). Finally, we showed that MACC1 knockdown in vitro reduced MET levels. Conclusions: A gene expression signature associated with EGFR-dependent phenotype was developed. The signature was shown to be prognostic regardless of EGFR status. The results also suggest MACC1 to be a regulator of MET in NSCLC.","title":"Use of an EGFR mutation signature to estimate prognosis in EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinomas and identify metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) as a regulator of MET.","pubmedId":"ASCO_61032-101"}
