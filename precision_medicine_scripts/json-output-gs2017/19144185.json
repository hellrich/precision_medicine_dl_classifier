{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Bony metastases were occasionally the initial presentations of malignancy. Overlooking of bony changes on radiographs in cancer patients with non-specific clinical symptoms may lead to delayed diagnosis.\nWe presented a 70-year-old male having hypercalcemia and diffuse osteoblastic bone metastases on routine plain films. Finally, prostate cancer was diagnosed with a prostate needle biopsy.\nAlthough the modern radionuclide bone scanning is useful in diagnosis, osteoblastic bone changes are occasionally seen in plain films, which are frequently overlooked. To avoid delayed diagnosis, bony structures should be carefully examined in all plain-film radiographs.","title":"A 70-year-old male having advanced prostate cancer presenting with hypercalcemia and diffuse osteoblastic bone metastases: a case report.","pubmedId":"19144185"}
