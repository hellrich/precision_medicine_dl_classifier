We report the first caucasian patient who presented with a rapidly enlarging liver mass requiring hepatic resection. Detailed histopathological analyses including immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy confirmed sarcomatoid cholangiocarcinoma. The patient had early onset disease recurrence within 5 weeks of surgery. Here we demonstrate that combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin is a potential treatment option in patients with advanced sarcomatous cholangiocarcinoma. The patient achieved sustained partial remission with combination chemotherapy and remains alive and well more than 29 months since initial surgery.","title":"Intrahepatic sarcomatoid cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20454704"}
