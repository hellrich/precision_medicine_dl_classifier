Preoperative examinations included head CT in all patients, DSA in 10, MRI in 6, and MRA in 2. 10 patients was operated on via suboccipital transtentorial approach, of which, operated-side-up position in 7 patients, three-quarter prone operated-side-down position in 3. Three 3 patients was operated on via trans-infratentorial-supracerebellar approach. One via trans-lateral-ventricle trigone approach.\nOf 14 patients, 12 received total removal of meningioma and 2, subtotal resection. Intracerebral hematoma occurred postoperatively in 2 patients and, intratumoral-residual-cavity hematoma in 1. Two patients\u0027 hematomas were eliminated, and another patient\u0027s hematoma was conservatively treated. Average follow-up period was 4.5 years. All patients resumed their normal work and study. One patient had permanent homonymous hemianopsia, and one had trochlear paralysis.\nMeningiomas of the falco-tentorial junction were operable. With some acceptable morbidity, perfect surgical results can be obtained.","title":"[Microsurgical treatment for meningioma of falco-tentorial junction].","pubmedId":"11829833"}
