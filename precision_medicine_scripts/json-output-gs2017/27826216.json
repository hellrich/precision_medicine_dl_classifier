Better fulfillment of quality standards has been seen for the size of pathology departments, percentage of unsatisfactory samples, percentage of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance with human papillomavirus-triage, and a slight decrease in the percentage of non-normal samples not followed up within the recommended time intervals. Stable patterns have been observed for participation rate, coverage, and number of incident cervical cancer cases. With a coverage of 75%, and with presently 16% of non-normal samples not followed up in a timely manner, there is definitely a scope for improvement in the screening program.\nThe database has pinpointed the strengths and weaknesses of the national cervical cancer screening program. Measures to enhance participation rate/coverage and to improve follow-up of non-normal cytology samples are warranted.","title":"The Danish Quality Database for Cervical Cancer Screening.","pubmedId":"27826216"}
