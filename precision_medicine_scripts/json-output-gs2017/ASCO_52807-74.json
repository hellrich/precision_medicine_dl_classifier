Dovitinib causes antitumor responses ranging from growth inhibition to regression in xenograft tumor models. Amplification of FGFR1 occurs in approximately 10% of breast tumors, and is an independent predictor of overall survival. FGFR1 amplification is uncommon in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplified BCs and is predominantly found in estrogen receptor (ER) positive, luminal type BCs. These data support testing dovitinib in women with HER2-negative (HER2-), FGFR1-amplified (FGFR1+) BC. In addition, the antiangiogenic activity of dovitinib may elicit antitumor activity in women with FGFR1-unamplified (FGFR1-) BC. Methods: This multicenter, open-label, 2-stage, phase II trial of dovitinib in FGFR1+ and FGFR1- metastatic HER2- breast cancer will determine the efficacy and safety of dovitinib in 4 groups of female patients (pts): (FGFR1+, HR+), (FGFR1+, HR-) (FGFR1-, HR+), (FGFR1-, HR-) where HR+ is defined as ER and/or progesterone receptor-positive BC. Pts must have received 1-3 prior therapies in the metastatic setting. Pts receive dovitinib 500 mg orally, once daily, on a 5 day on/2 day off schedule, on a 28 day cycle until disease progression or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective is overall response rate. Secondary objectives include disease control rate, progression-free survival, safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics. The pharmacodynamic effect of dovitinib on plasma/serum biomarkers and the effect of FGFR and VEGF polymorphisms on response will be explored. Pts must have tumor tissue available for FGFR1 amplification screening by FISH/CISH. Analysis for the primary objective will include 20 pts with measurable disease at baseline in each stage for each group.","title":"Study CTKI258A2202: A multicenter, open-label phase II trial of dovitinib (TKI258) in FGFR1-amplified and nonamplified HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_52807-74"}
