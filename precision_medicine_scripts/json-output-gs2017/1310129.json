The chemotherapeutic response rates were 32% and 33%, respectively. The median times to progression of disease were identical (3 months in both groups). The median survival times were 4 months and 6 months, respectively. Metastatic bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is an aggressive disease that is associated with a poor prognosis, similar to metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung.","title":"Metastatic bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung: comparison of clinical manifestations, chemotherapeutic responses, and prognosis.","pubmedId":"1310129"}
