Analyses were carried out using a chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods.\nComplete response (CR) or no evidence of disease (NED) was observed in 87% of the BRCA1 patients, progressive disease (PD) in 2%, being 71% and 15%, respectively, in sporadic EOC patients (P \u003d 0.002). In BRCA2 patients, 92% had CR/NED, and none PD (P \u003d 0.27). Median PFS in BRCA1, BRCA2 and sporadic patients was 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-2.5] years (P \u003d 0.006), 5.6 (95% CI 0.0-11.5) years (P \u003d 0.008) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.5) years, respectively. Median OS in the three groups was 5.9 (95% CI 4.7-7.0) years (P \u003c 0.001), \u003e10 years (P \u003d 0.008), and 2.9 (95% CI 2.2-3.5) years, respectively. A trend for a longer PFS and OS in BRCA2 compared with BRCA1 patients was observed.\nCompared with sporadic EOC patients, both BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated patients have improved outcomes after primary therapy, including chemotherapy.","title":"Chemosensitivity and outcome of BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated ovarian cancer patients after first-line chemotherapy compared with sporadic ovarian cancer patients.","pubmedId":"21228333"}
