Its desmoplastic histology and the heterogeneity of its presentation have contributed to its poor prognosis, with limited therapeutic options previously available. However, recent advances using locoregional therapy may expand the treatment arsenal used to manage this resistant malignancy. Although surgical resection has previously been reserved for relatively few patients because of inadequate hepatic reserve, portal vein embolization can induce contralateral hepatic lobe hypertrophy to increase the number of patients eligible for resection. For unresectable cases, both transarterial chemoembolization and yttrium-90 radioembolization have shown effectiveness in controlling tumor growth and prolonging survival.
