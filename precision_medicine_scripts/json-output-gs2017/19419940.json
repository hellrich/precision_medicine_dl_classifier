We analysed KRAS in 11 cases of complex atypical hyperplasia and in 49 endometrial carcinomas using polymerase chain reaction associated with restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFPL). Point mutations at codon 12 of KRAS oncogene were identified in 7 of 49 (14,3%) tumor specimens and in 2 of 11 (18,2%) hyperplasias. No correlation was found between KRAS gene mutation and age at onset, histology, grade of differentiation and clinical stage. We conclude that KRAS mutation is a relatively common event in endometrial carcinogenesis, but with no prognostic value.","title":"Mutations of the KRAS oncogene in endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma.","pubmedId":"19419940"}
