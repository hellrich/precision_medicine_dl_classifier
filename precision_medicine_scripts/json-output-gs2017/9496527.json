The objective of this study was to determine the most appropriate surgical treatment for gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach.\nThe clinicopathological characteristics of 115 node-positive gastric cancers in the upper third of the stomach were reviewed retrospectively and compared with those of 111 node-negative gastric cancers in the upper third of the stomach.\nNode-positive gastric cancers showed higher rates of peritoneal metastasis (p \u003c 0.005), larger tumor sizes (p \u003c 0.005), deeper tumor penetration (p \u003c 0.005), higher rates of diffuse type in histology (p \u003c 0.025), and more advanced histological stages (p \u003c 0.005), than node-negative gastric cancers. Patients with node-positive gastric cancer demonstrated a poorer survival rate than those with node-negative gastric cancer (p \u003c 0.005). Lymph node metastasis along the lower stomach was observed in cases of gastric cancer which had invaded beyond the muscularis propria of the stomach but not in those confined within the muscularis propria. No lymph node metastasis in the splenic hilum was found in association with gastric cancer when the depth was limited to the mucosa or the submucosa.\nThe appropriate surgical procedures for the treatment of gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach are as follows: a) proximal gastrectomy without splenectomy for gastric cancer when the depth is limited to the mucosa or the submucosa, b) proximal gastrectomy with splenectomy for gastric cancer when the depth of invasion extends to the muscularis propria, c) total gastrectomy with splenectomy for gastric cancer when the depth of invasion extends beyond the muscularis propria.","title":"Lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach--surgical treatment on the basis of the anatomical distribution of positive node.","pubmedId":"9496527"}
