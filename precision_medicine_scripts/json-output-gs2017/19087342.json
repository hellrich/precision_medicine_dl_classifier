The patient was a 78-year-old male where Chest X-ray had revealed a tumour-suspected structure in the left lung. Both transthoracic echocardiography and combined PET/CT images showed a large tumour located close to the heart. Fine-needle biopsy showed non-small cell lung cancer.","title":"Primary lung tumour visualised by transthoracic echocardiography.","pubmedId":"19087342"}
