Pancreatic duct wire-guided endoscopic snaring before resection can reduce the post-procedure stenting failure rate. We evaluated the usefulness of this approach.\nPancreatic duct wire-guided endoscopic papillectomy was performed in 72 patients with ampullary adenoma. The snare loop was passed over a guide wire inserted into the pancreatic duct. After resection, a pancreatic stent was immediately placed along or alongside the guide wire.\nPancreatic duct stenting was successful in all patients after endoscopic papillectomy. Post-procedure pancreatitis occurred in 6/72 (8 %), but was mild and resolved with conservative treatment. Complete endoscopic resection of ampullary adenoma was achieved in 65/72 (90 %), with en bloc resection in 60/72 (83 %). There was no procedure-associated mortality. Follow-up (mean 23.7 months) showed recurrence in 5/65 (8 %) who had undergone complete resection.\nPancreatic duct wire-guided endoscopic snare papillectomy for ampullary adenoma effectively facilitated pancreatic duct stenting to prevent severe post-procedure pancreatitis.","title":"Usefulness of pancreatic duct wire-guided endoscopic papillectomy for ampullary adenoma for preventing post-procedure pancreatitis.","pubmedId":"23918619"}
