Slides were evaluated for membranous EGFR and IGF-1R staining using both the HercepTest and the semiquantitative H-score systems. Chromogenic in situ hybridization was performed to quantify IGF-1R gene copy number. The primary outcome was the association between EGFR expression, IGF-1R expression-in both neoplastic epithelial and stromal cells-or IGF-1R gene copy number and overall survival. Secondary outcomes included associations between EFGR and IGF-1R expression and pathologic variables.\nA total of 105 patients were included. EGFR expression was present in 30.4% of cases and was associated with lymph node metastasis (P \u003d .038). IGF-1R was overexpressed in 53% of tumors and correlated with higher tumor grade (P \u003d .033). High membranous expression of EGFR (P \u003c .001) and/or IGF-1R (P \u003d .004), the cytoplasmic detection of EGFR (P \u003d .027), and high expression levels of IGF-1R in the tumoral stroma (P \u003c .001) were all associated with shorter overall survival, being significantly better in patients who simultaneously do not express membranous EGFR or stromal IGF-1R.\nEGFR and IGF-1R expression, in neoplastic and stromal cells, seems to be an important prognostic factor.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor and insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor expression predict poor survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22086503"}
