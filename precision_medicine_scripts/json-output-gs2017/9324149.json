Furthermore, increasingly frequent reports of port site recurrences with laparoscopic colectomy for limited stage colon carcinoma prompted us to evaluate the incidence of tumor cell spillage with traditional \"open\" colonic surgery.\nFifty random patients undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma were prospectively evaluated with peritoneal washings prior to and following colon resection.\nFive patients (10%) were found to have malignant cytology, with no patients converting from negative to positive cytology. All five positive cytologies were associated with stage IV disease and poorly differentiated colon cancer.\nIntraoperative peritoneal cancer dissemination could not be demonstrated by cytologic washings of the abdominal cavity before and after colorectal resection utilizing standard cytomorphological criteria.","title":"Colorectal carcinoma and the relationship of peritoneal cytology.","pubmedId":"9324149"}
