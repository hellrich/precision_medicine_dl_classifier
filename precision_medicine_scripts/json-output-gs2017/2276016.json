All tumours stained positively, but Dukes\u0027 C tumours exhibited significantly higher levels of receptor than either Dukes\u0027 A or B tumours. In addition, histologically high grade cancers expressed receptors more strongly than those of low grade. It is concluded that a high EGF receptor concentration is associated with poor prognostic factors in colorectal malignancy.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"2276016"}
