Here, we elucidate in vitro mechanisms that may explain the observed differential response of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expressing pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts to Erbitux-based combination therapy in vivo. MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 protein lysates were probed with antibodies to EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Constitutive ErbB3 activity was visualized by immunoblot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and receptor-specific immunoprecipitates. erbB2 and erbB3 gene expression in both cell lines was quantified with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Erbitux-induced internalization of EGFR was determined by flow cytometry following Erbitux treatment for different incubation times at 0 degrees C and 37 degrees C. MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 protein extracts were also probed with anti-phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase antibody after stimulation with EGF and in the presence of Erbitux. Although both cell lines expressed EGFR and ErbB2 protein, ErbB3 protein was selectively expressed by BxPC-3 cells, where it also showed evidence of constitutive phosphorylation. There was a 10-fold increase of erbB3 transcript levels in BxPC-3 cells compared with MIA PaCa-2. ErbB4 protein was not detectable in either cell line. Erbitux mediated EGFR internalization in MIA PaCa-2 cells after 2 hours of incubation, whereas it did not promote EGFR internalization in BxPC-3 cells. Likewise, EGF-dependent phosphorylation of MAPK p44/42 was blocked by Erbitux treatment in MIA PaCa-2 but not BxPC-3 cells. Erbitux selectively interfered with EGF-induced MAPK activation in MIA PaCa-2 but not BxPC-3 cells. Persistent MAPK activation and impaired in vitro internalization of EGFR by BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells may be due to constitutive ErbB3 signaling, facilitated by heterodimerization with EGFR, which may explain resistance to Erbitux-based combination therapy in vivo.","title":"Mechanisms of resistance to Erbitux (anti-epidermal growth factor receptor) combination therapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"15585383"}
