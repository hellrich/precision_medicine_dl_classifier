Here we report our results using the new pCONus device with special emphasis on the morphological and anatomical requirements for successful implantation.\nIn this study we treated 21 patients with 22 aneurysms by endovascular interventions. After providing informed consent, patients were included according to the following criteria: aneurysm dome to neck ratio \u003c2 or neck diameter \u003e4 mm. The primary end points for clinical safety were the absence of death, absence of major or minor stroke and absence of transient ischemic attack.\nA total of 22 aneurysms in 21 patients were treated with pCONus-assisted coiling. In 19 patients harboring 20 aneurysms the implantation of the device was successful and these aneurysms showed an adequate occlusion after 6 months in 95 %. The complication rate was low (5 %) with one case of minor neurological stroke. Analysis of the data showed that the difference in aneurysm angulation between successful (mean 45°) and failed implantations (mean 71.5°) was highly significant.\nUse of the pCONus device and coiling in wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms is safe and provides good occlusion rates but might be limited by the angulation between the aneurysm and the parent vessel.","title":"The pCONus Device in Treatment of Wide-necked Aneurysms : Technical and Midterm Clinical and Angiographic Results.","pubmedId":"27637921"}
