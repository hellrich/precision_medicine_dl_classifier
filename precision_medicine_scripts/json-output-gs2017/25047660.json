KIF5B-RET fusion is an oncogene identified in non-small cell lung cancers. In this study, we verified the oncogenic activity of KIF5B-RET fusion and investigated how KIF5B-RET activates the specific signaling pathways for cellular transformation. We aimed to provide a basis for the further development of the therapy for KIF5B-RET positive lung cancer patients.\nRT-PCR was used to screen for KIF5B-RET fusions in Chinese lung cancer patients. To verify the oncogenic activity of KIF5B-RET kinase in lung cancer cells, we manipulated its expression genetically followed by colony formation and tumor formation assays. The mechanism by which KIF5B-RET kinase induces proliferation was investigated by western blot, coimmunoprecipitation, and administration of RET, MAPK and STAT3 inhibitors.\nOur study identified a KIF5B-RET fusion in Chinese NSCLC patients and demonstrated that KIF5B-RET transfected cells showed a significantly increased proliferation rate and colony-forming ability. Furthermore, we found that KIF5B-RET fusion kinase induced multilevel activation of STAT3 at both Tyr705 and Ser727, and KIF5B-RET-STAT3 signaling related inhibitors repressed the proliferation and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells significantly.\nOur data suggest that KIF5B-RET promotes the cell growth and tumorigenicity of non-small cell lung cancers through multilevel activation of STAT3 signaling, providing possible strategies for the treatment of KIF5B-RET positive lung cancers.","title":"KIF5B-RET fusion kinase promotes cell growth by multilevel activation of STAT3 in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25047660"}
