The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the clinical, radiological, histopathological features and prognosis for papillary meningioma at our institutions.\nTen patients with clinically, radiologically and histopathologically confirmed papillary meningiomas were treated at our hospitals. The clinical data, imaging characteristics, histopathological features, surgical treatment and postoperative follow-up, were analyzed retrospectively.\nThe patients with a mean age of 36.9 years at the time of their initial operations. The papillary meningiomas were predominantly located in the convexity (n \u003d 6). At their initial operation, six patients underwent gross total resection and four patients underwent subtotal resection. The mean post-operative follow-up period was 42.6 months (range: 12-90 months). Six patients underwent multiple surgical resections. The mean time to first recurrence was 21.5 months. On magnetic resonance imaging scan, marked enhancements and dural tail signs were displayed in all lesions. All lesions showed peritumoral edema. Cysts were seen in four lesions. Bone hyperostosis or destruction was seen in six lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid dissemination was seen in three lesions. Incomplete surgical resection was associated with recurrence. MIB-1 labeling index was associated with progression-free survival for patients (p \u003d 0.0442).\nPapillary meningioma has a tendency to present in middle-aged patients, and it has specific clinical and histopathological characteristics. MIB-1 labeling index and the extent of resection might predict the recurrence. Cystic formation, peritumoral edema, osseous change and CSF dissemination might be neuroimaging characteristics of papillary meningioma, especially in recurrence papillary meningioma.","title":"Papillary meningioma: an aggressive variant meningioma with clinical features and treatment: a retrospective study of 10 cases.","pubmedId":"26299848"}
