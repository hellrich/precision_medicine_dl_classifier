Crizotinib, an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, shows dramatic clinical efficacy with a response rate of approximately 60%-80% in EML4-ALK NSCLC patients. However, almost all patients who strongly responded to crizotinib acquired resistance over time. Recently, new generation ALK-TKIs such as alectinib and ceritinib have been approved for treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, and it is now clear that resistance may also develop against this class of inhibitors. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying tumor progression and targeted drug sensitivity/resistance in EML4-ALK lung cancer, clinically relevant animal models are indispensable.Methods: A human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A925L, which expresses an EML4-ALK gene fusion (variant 5a, E2:A20), established from a surgical specimen obtained from a Japanese male patient. We further established highly tumorigenic A925LPE3 cells with luciferase gene transfection, which also have the EML4-ALK gene fusion. A925LPE3 cells were injected into the right thoracic cavity for the pleural carcinomatosis model, into the tibia for the bone metastasis model, and into the right striatum for the brain metastasis model. After inoculation, the quantity of tumors and the quality of bones were tracked in live mice by repeated noninvasive optical imaging of tumor-specific luciferase activity using the IVIS Lumina XR Imaging System.Results: In this study, we found that A925L and A925LPE3 cell lines are sensitive to the ALK inhibitors crizotinib and alectinib. By using A925LPE3 cells we established in vivo imaging models for pleural carcinomatosis, bone metastasis, and brain metastasis, all of which are significant clinical concerns of advanced EML4-ALK lung cancer. Interestingly, crizotinib caused tumors to shrink in the pleural carcinomatosis model, but not in bone and brain metastasis models, while alectinib showed remarkable efficacy in all three models, indicative of the clinical efficacy of these ALK inhibitors.Conclusions: Our in vivo imaging models of multiple organ sites may provide useful resources to analyze further the pathogenesis of EML4-ALK lung cancer and its response and resistance to ALK inhibitors in various organ microenvironments.","title":"In vivo imaging models of bone and brain metastases and pleural carcinomatosis developed using a novel human EML4-ALK lung cancer cell line, A925LPE3","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-5122"}
