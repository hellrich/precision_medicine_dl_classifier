In addition, in a subgroup of 28 patients for whom the remaining tumor tissue was available, we examined the relationship among EGFR mutations, CA repeats in intron 1 of EGFR, EGFR and caveolin-1 mRNA levels, and increased EGFR gene copy numbers.\nSeventeen patients had EGFR mutations, all of which were in lung adenocarcinomas. Radiographic response was observed in 16 of 17 (94.1%) patients harboring EGFR mutations, in contrast with 6 of 51 (12.6%) with wild-type EGFR (P \u003c 0.0001). Probability of response increased significantly in never smokers, patients receiving a greater number of prior chemotherapy regimens, Asians, and younger patients. Median survival was not reached for patients with EGFR mutations and was 9.9 months for those with wild-type EGFR (P \u003d 0.001). EGFR mutations tended to be associated with increased numbers of CA repeats and increased EGFR gene copy numbers but not with EGFR and caveolin-1 mRNA overexpression (P \u003d not significant).\nThe presence of EGFR mutations is a major determinant of gefitinib response, and targeting EGFR should be considered in preference to chemotherapy as first-line treatment in lung adenocarcinomas that have demonstrable EGFR mutations.","title":"Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor are associated with improved survival in gefitinib-treated chemorefractory lung adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"16115929"}
