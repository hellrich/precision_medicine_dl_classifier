Mutations of the Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene are frequently observed in these tumors. Schwannomas and meningiomas cause significant morbidities, and an FDA-approved medical therapy is currently not available. The development of preclinical animal models that accurately capture the clinical characteristics of these tumors will facilitate the evaluation of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of these tumors, ultimately leading to more productive clinical trials. Here, we describe the generation of luciferase-expressing NF2-deficient schwannoma and meningioma cells and the use of these cells to establish orthotopic tumor models in immunodeficient mice. The growth of these tumors and their response to treatment can be measured effectively by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and confirmed by small-animal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These and other animal models, such as genetically-engineered models, should substantially advance the investigation of promising therapies for schwannomas and meningiomas.
