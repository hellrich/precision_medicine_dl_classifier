Recent studies show that MET enables cells to overcome damages inflicted by cancer anti-proliferative targeted therapies, radiotherapy or anti-angiogenic agents. After exposure to such therapies, clones of MET-amplified cancer cells arise within the context of genetically heterogeneous tumors and-exploiting an ample platform of signaling pathways-drive recurrence. In cancer stem cells, not only amplification, but also MET physiological expression, inherited from the cell of origin (a stem/progenitor), can contribute to tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance, by sustaining the inherent self-renewing, self-preserving and invasive growth phenotype.
