Host activation of RAS was significant for IFN-sensitive vaccinia virus (delE3L) or attenuate influenza virus in unallowable cells.\nHuamn NRAS gene was activated by mutating in codon 61. Then the activation of NRAS was detected by western blot in MDCK cells. The delNS1 H5N1 influenza virus with deletion of NS1 eIF4GI binding domain was weak multiplication in MDCK cells. And the replication of delNS1 virus and expression of IFN-beta and IRF-3 were detected by Real-time PCR in MDCK cells infected with delNS1 virus. It was found that the delNS1 virus had a significant increase in MDCK cells when the NRAS was activated, and yet, expression of IRF-3 and IFN-beta were restrained.\nThe study demonstrated that activated NRAS played an important part for delNS1 virus replication in MDCK cells. Activated NRAS might be down-regulating the expression of antiviral cellular factors in delNS1 virus infected cells.","title":"Effect of human activated NRAS on replication of delNS1 H5N1 influenza virus in MDCK cells.","pubmedId":"21595878"}
