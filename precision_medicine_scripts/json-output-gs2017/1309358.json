To determine whether ras activation also occurs in noninvasive proliferative lesions of the pancreas, a series of cases of ductal papillary hyperplasia, intraductal papillary neoplasia, and intraduct extensions of ductal adenocarcinoma were examined for activating mutations of Ki-ras at codons 12, 13, and 61 using polymerase chain reaction amplification. Specific mutations at Ki-ras codon 12 were found in 5 of 6 cases (83%) of intraduct extensions of carcinomas and in 12 of 16 (75%) invasive carcinomas. In cases with both intraductal and invasive components, the same mutation was identified in each. No mutations were found in 5 intraductal papillary neoplasms and 9 cases of ductal papillary hyperplasia. The authors conclude that Ki-ras activation at codon 12 is important in the tumorigenesis of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas but is not required in the pathogenesis of ductal papillary hyperplasia or intraductal papillary neoplasm.","title":"Ki-ras oncogene activation in preinvasive pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"1309358"}
