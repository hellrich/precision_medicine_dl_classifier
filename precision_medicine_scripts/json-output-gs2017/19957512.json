The comparison of long-term survival rates was made between post-chemotherapy and surgical resection alone.\nThe analyses disclosed that the stage I a 1, 3, 5 and 10-year survival rate of post-chemotherapy was 100.00%, 92.34%, 86.17% and 74.82%, respectively, while in surgical resection alone was 96.63%, 88.11%, 79.52% and 65.85%, respectively. The stage I b 1, 3, 5 and 10-year survival rate of post-chemotherapy was 96.84%, 77.99%, 69.56% and 64.36%, respectively, while in surgical resection alone was 85.65%, 67.11%, 59.56% and 53.06%, respectively. There was statistically significant difference between 1 year survival rate of stage I a patients with post-chemotherapy and those with surgical resection alone (P \u003c 0.05); 1 year survival rate of stage I b patients with post-chemotherapy and those with surgical resection alone (P \u003c 0.01).\nThe operation plus post-operative chemotherapy is better than surgical resection alone in stage I a and I b. Surgical plus post-operative chemotherapy mode is indispensable for better prognosis of stage I a and I b lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"[Long-term results of surgical plus chemotherapy for stage I lung adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"19957512"}
