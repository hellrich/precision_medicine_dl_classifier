The aim of this study is to describe a single-centre\u0027s experience.\nData were collected retrospectively on all patients with solid pancreatic masses undergoing EUS-FNA from January 2006 to March 2011. In tumor cases, TNM staging using EUS was compared with the results of histopathological staging.\nEUS-FNA of pancreatic lesions was performed in 125 patients. Of these patients, data of 75 were available (69% men, mean age 59.97Â±11.12 (SD) years); 58 (76%) of the lesions were ductal adenocarcinoma, 11 (14.5%) were chronic pancreatitis, 4 (%5) were intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma (IPMN) and 2 (%3) were insulinoma. Diagnostic yield of the EUS-FNA procedure was 74.7% (56/75). Specimens from six patients were inadequate. In multivariate analysis, lesion diameter below 2cm was an independent predictor for the inadequacy of material (p\u003d0.04).\nIn patients with pancreatic mass with suspected malignancy, EUS-FNA provided a diagnosis with accuracy rate of 75%. Inadequate material with EUS-FNA was significantly more frequent in lesions below 2cm.","title":"The role of EUS and EUS-FNA in the management of pancreatic masses: five-year experience.","pubmedId":"23321061"}
