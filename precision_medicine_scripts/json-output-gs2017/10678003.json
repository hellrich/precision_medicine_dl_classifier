Among them, 601 had gallbladder carcinomas, and 229 cholangiocarcinomas. The results showed that extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma accounted for 6.77% of bile duct diseases. Gallbladder carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas accounted for 72.4% and 27.6% of extrahepatic biliary carcinomas, while the mean age was 56.55 and 56.44 years old, respectively. The sex ratio (male:female) was 1:2. 54 and 1. 46:1. The operation rate and resection rate were 65.1% and 29.4% in gallbladder carcinoma while 66.4% and 20.4% in cholangiocarcinoma. The incidence rate and resection rate of extrahepatic biliary carcinomas were elevated.","title":"[Retrospective analysis of 830 extrahepatic biliary carcinoma].","pubmedId":"10678003"}
