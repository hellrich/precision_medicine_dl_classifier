The primary carcinomas and metastases demonstrate a high degree of genomic instability manifested by nonreciprocal translocations without obvious telomere erosion-hallmarks of human carcinomas not typically observed in mice. No mutations were discovered in other cardinal tumor suppressor gene pathways, which, together with previous results, suggests that there are distinct genetic pathways to PDA with different biological behaviors. These findings have clear implications for understanding mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, and for the development of detection and targeted treatment strategies.","title":"Trp53R172H and KrasG12D cooperate to promote chromosomal instability and widely metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in mice.","pubmedId":"15894267"}
