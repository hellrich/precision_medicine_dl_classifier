Suppression of TGFβ1 activity inhibits downstream target gene expression mediated by miR-34a that includes cyclin D1, CDK6, and c-Met. In addition, \"knockdown\" of TGFβ1 expression revealed a miR-34a positive feedback mechanism for enhanced p21 expression in CCAs. A miR-34a inhibitor reversed the effects of \"knocking down\" TGFβ1 on cell growth, migration, cyclin D1, CDK6 and c-Met expression, suggesting that TGFβ1 mediated effects occur, in part, through this miR-34a signaling pathway. Overexpression of TGFβ1 was associated with CCA tumor progression.\nThis study suggests that TGFβ1 is involved in CCA tumor progression and participates through miR-34a mediated downstream cascades, and is a target to inhibit CCA development and growth.","title":"Expression of transforming growth factor β1 promotes cholangiocarcinoma development and progression.","pubmedId":"27364974"}
