The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of immunostaining using these two EGFR mutation-specific antibodies were 83.1%, 95.7%, 90.7% and 90.9%, respectively.\nWith high sensitivity and good specificity, immunohistochemistry using EGFR mutation-specific monoclonal antibodies is an adequate, easy and cost-effective prescreening method to detect EGFR mutations using paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of lung adenocarcinomas.","title":"[Immunohistochemistry using epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-specific antibodies of delE746-A750 and L858R in lung adenocarcinomas].","pubmedId":"23769436"}
