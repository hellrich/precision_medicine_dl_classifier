The EGFR is involved in tumor progression and invasion and therefore it has become the target of several studies in lung cancer. Strategies to block this pathway are focused on the development of small molecule (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Some mAbs have been studied in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. For the first time, a fully human immunoglobulin G (IMC-11F8), subclass 1 (IgG1) mAb targeting the EGFR, in combination with standard chemotherapy (cisplatin + gemcitabine), has been shown to increase overall survival in chemo-na√Øve patients with metastatic confirmed squamous cell histology.","title":"Necitumumab for the treatment of stage IV metastatic squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25797462"}
