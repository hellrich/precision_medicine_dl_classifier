Rearrangements of these three genes exist predominantly in lung adenocarcinoma while rarely in non-adenocarcinoma. Our objective was to explore the frequency, clinicopathological characteristics and survival of ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements in non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients.\nALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements were screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in patients with completely resected non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC. All positive samples were confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank for comparison.\nA total of 385 patients underwent complete resection, including squamous cell carcinoma (n \u003d 245), adenosquamous carcinoma (n \u003d 85) and large cell carcinoma (n \u003d 55). Twelve of them were identified as harboring fusion genes, including ALK (n \u003d 7), ROS1 (n \u003d 3) and RET (n \u003d 2) rearrangements. The fusion frequencies of adenosquamous, squamous cell and large cell carcinomas were 8.2%, 1.6% and 1.8% respectively. Their median age was 49.5 years and 3 of them had a smoking history. No survival difference existed between fusion gene positive and negative patients (36.7 vs.50.2 months, P \u003d 0.21).\nThe frequencies of ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements are low in non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients. And their clinical characteristics are similar to those in lung adenocarcinoma. Fusions of the above three genes are not prognostic factor for non-adnocarcinoma NSCLC patients.","title":"Clinicopathological Characteristics and Survival of ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements in Non-Adenocarcinoma Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients.","pubmedId":"27635639"}
