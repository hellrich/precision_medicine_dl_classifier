Relationship between Gli-1 expression and clinicopathological parameters, postoperative liver metastasis were analyzed.\nGli-1 protein expression was significantly increased in colon cancer tissues compared to normal colon tissues (P\u003d0.037). Gli-1 expression in colon tissues was increased in patients with lymph node metastases (P\u003d0.022) and higher T stages (P\u003d0.030). Postoperative live metastasis-free survival period was significantly longer in low Gli-1 expression group than that of high Gli-1 expression group (48.22±10.03 months vs 20.46±6.32 months, P\u003d0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that Gli-1 expression level is an independent prognostic factor for postoperative live metastasis-free survival.\nColon cancer is associated with an upregulation of Gli-1 protein expression in colon tissues. In patients with colon cancer, Gli-1 expression level is closely related to lymph node metastases, T stages and postoperative live metastasis-free survival periods, indicative of a possible role of Gli-1 expression in colon cancer progression.","title":"Expression of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 is associated with invasion and postoperative liver metastasis in colon cancer.","pubmedId":"22745574"}
