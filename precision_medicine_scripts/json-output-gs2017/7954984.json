The rationale for total pancreatectomy comes from a tendency for pancreatic cancer to be multicentric, the absence of the pancreatico-enterostomy and the argument that total pancreatectomy is a better cancer procedure (wider lymphadenectomy and soft tissue resection). In spite of these theoretical advantages, any important impact on morbidity, mortality and ultimately on survival has not been realised. We analyse the principal metabolic and functional sequelae of total pancreatectomy, particularly highlighting the importance of glucagone hormone in maintaining correct blood glucose levels. The data suggest, a tendency to use total pancreatectomy in selected patients on the basis of pre- and intraoperative cytodiagnosis to prevent occult neoplasms in the pancreatic remnant.","title":"[Total versus partial pancreatectomy in the surgical treatment of carcinoma of the pancreatic head].","pubmedId":"7954984"}
