No correlation was observed between episialin and EGFR or c-erbB-2 expression. Survival analysis showed that episialin depolarised expression correlated with poor prognosis (p \u003d 0.003), especially in squamous cell cases (p \u003d 0.0003). Episialin expression defined a group of patients with poor prognosis in the node positive category (p \u003d 0.003). In multivariate analysis episialin was the most significant independent prognostic factor (p \u003d 0.007), followed by N stage (p \u003d 0.04).\nDepolarised expression of episialin is associated with poor outcome in early stage non-small cell lung cancer. Despite the similar activity on the cadherin cell-cell adhesion system, the expression of episialin and c-erbB oncoproteins is likely to be activated within different pathogenic pathways.","title":"MUC1 (episialin) expression in non-small cell lung cancer is independent of EGFR and c-erbB-2 expression and correlates with poor survival in node positive patients.","pubmedId":"9930070"}
