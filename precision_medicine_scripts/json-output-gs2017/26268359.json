These mutational changes are known to be mutually exclusive, but the co-existence of ALK rearrangement with activating mutations of EGFR is rarely found.\nWe examined the KIF5B-RET fusion gene in frozen tissues from 154 surgically resected lung tumors using RT-PCR with direct sequencing and the mutation status of EGFR and KRAS genes using PNA clamping. We tested KIF5B-RET translocation in Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded using fluorescence in situ hybridization. We also measured RET mRNA and protein expression by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively.\nThe existence of KIF5B-RET fusion gene was identified in 9 patients. The mean age was 67.2 and M: F ratio 4:5. Of 9 patients, 3 patients harbored wild type of EGFR and KRAS gene. However, KIF5B-RET fusion gene coincided with EGFR or KRAS mutation in 6 patients. These six pts were also positive for both RET break-apart probes (23.9%) and KIF5B-RET fusion (44.4%). However, there were no correlations between RET mRNA and protein expression in the KIF5B-RET-positive patients. The median disease free survival and overall survival were 23.9 months and 29.5 months, respectively.\nTaken together, our data suggest one-step screening platform for KIF5B-RET as well as EGFR, K-RAS, ALK oncogenic mutations be necessary for lung adenocarcinoma patients because EGFR or KRAS mutation are not infrequently found in KIF5B-RET-positive patients.","title":"KIF5B-RET Fusion gene may coincide oncogenic mutations of EGFR or KRAS gene in lung adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"26268359"}
