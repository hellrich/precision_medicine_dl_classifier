The correlation of CDK6 expression with the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the patients was analyzed.\nThe expression of CDK6 mRNA was obviously up-regulated in 36 ovarian cancer tissues as compared to that in 16 ovarian tissues. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CDK6 protein was expressed in both the cytoplasm and cell nuclei. Compared with the 48 normal ovarian tissues, the 121 ovarian cancer tissues showed significantly up-regulated CDK6 protein expression (P\u003d0.044). Increased CDK6 protein expression was not significantly correlated with the clinical features of the patients with ovarian cancer, but showed a significant negative correlation with the patients\u0027 prognosis (P\u003d0.006). Multivariate analysis suggested that CDK6 expression level was an independent prognostic indicator (P\u003d0.008) for the survival of patients with ovarian cancer.\nIncreased CDK6 protein expression may promote the development and progression of early ovarian cancer.","title":"[Expression of CDK6 in early ovarian cancer and its clinical significance].","pubmedId":"27687663"}
