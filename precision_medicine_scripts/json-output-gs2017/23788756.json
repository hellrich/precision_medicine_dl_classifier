ROS1 and ALK rearrangements were identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization.\nOf 208 tumors screened, 7 (3.4%) were ROS1 rearranged, and 15 (7.2%) were ALK-rearranged. CD74-ROS1 fusions were identified in two patients using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of ROS1 rearrangement was 5.7% (6 of 105) among EGFR/KRAS/ALK-negative patients. Patients with ROS1 rearrangement had a higher objective response rate (ORR; 60.0% versus 8.5%; P \u003d 0.01) and a longer median progression-free survival (PFS; not reached versus 3.3 months; P \u003d 0.008) to pemetrexed than those without ROS1/ALK rearrangement. The PFS to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients harboring ROS1 rearrangement was shorter than those without ROS1/ALK rearrangement (2.5 versus 7.8 months; P \u003d 0.01).\nThe frequency of ROS1 rearrangements in clinically selected patients is higher than that reported for unselected patients, suggesting that ROS1 rearrangement is a druggable target in East-Asian never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma. Given the different treatment outcomes to conventional therapies and availability of ROS1 inhibitors, identification of ROS1 rearrangement can lead to successful treatment in ROS1-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas.","title":"The frequency and impact of ROS1 rearrangement on clinical outcomes in never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23788756"}
