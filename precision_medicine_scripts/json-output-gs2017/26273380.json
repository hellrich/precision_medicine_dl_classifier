Lung cancer causes both physical and psychological burdens on patients, and financial burdens on families and society. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between depression and influencing factors in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.\nA quantitative study was applied. Data was obtained from the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital in China. One hundred and four patients with NSCLC were surveyed. Self-rating depression scale (SDS), social support rating scale (SSRS), and visual analog scale (VAS) were used.\nAmong the 104 patients, 48 (46.1%) were diagnosed with depression. Gender (P \u003d 0.000), disease duration (P \u003d 0.006), self-care ability (P \u003d 0.004), and pain (P \u003d 0.003) were statistically significant predictors of self-reported depression in non-small-cell lung cancer patients.\nSelf-reported depression is highly prevalent in NSCLC patients. In addition, gender, disease duration, self-care ability, pain and social support may increase self-reported depression.","title":"Self-reported depression among patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26273380"}
