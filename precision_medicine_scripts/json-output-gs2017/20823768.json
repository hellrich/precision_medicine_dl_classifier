Gain-of-function mutations in these 2 genes, which result in constitutive signaling, are presumed to be dominant and therefore are usually heterozygous. However, homozygous C-KIT mutations have been reported in GISTs, although at varying frequencies in different subsets.\nHigh-resolution amplicon melting curve analysis and direct sequencing were used to determine the frequency of mutation zygosity in a series of 267 GIST cases with known C-KIT (exons 9, 11, 13 and 17) or PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) mutations. Mutation zygosity was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics including sex, age, tumor size, tumor location, and C-KIT immunohistochemistry.\nForty-two of 267 (15.7%) mutant GISTs were homozygous: 36 in C-KIT exon 11, 1 in C-KIT exon 13, 2 in PDGFRA exon 12, and 3 in PDGFRA exon 18. No correlation was found between mutation zygosity and age, sex, tumor size, or C-KIT expression. Homozygous mutant GISTs from the small intestine were underrepresented (P\u003d0.029) whereas GISTs from metastatic sites such as the liver or pancreas were significantly enriched for mutant homozygosity (P\u003d0.020).\nZygosity of C-KIT or PDGFRA mutations did not correlate with most clinicopathologic features of GISTs including tumor size in our subset. However, homozygous mutant GISTs were associated with metastatic disease.","title":"C-KIT and PDGFRA zygosity in gastrointestinal stromal tumors: Correlation with tumor site, tumor size, exon, and CD117 immunohistochemistry.","pubmedId":"20823768"}
