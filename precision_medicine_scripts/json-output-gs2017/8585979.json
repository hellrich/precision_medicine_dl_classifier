Expression of c-erbB2 was also examined by immunohistochemistry. Amplification of c-erbB2, c-myc and int-2 genes was found in 34.7%, 17.8% and 11.9% of breast cancers respectively. However amplification of c-Ha-ras was not detected in all cases. In 11.9% of cases co-amplification of two or more oncogenes was observed. Positive immunostaining of c-erbB2 was seen in 23.8% of the cases and it was significantly associated, but not always corresponding to the amplification of the gene. There was no difference between primary and metastatic breast cancer in the alterations of proto-oncogenes examined in this study, which suggested that the amplification and overexpression of these proto-oncogenes occurred prior to and maintained in the process of metastasis of breast cancer. Statistical analysis showed that high-scale of immunopositive staining of c-erbB2 and high-fold co-amplification of proto-oncogenes were significantly correlated with large size of the tumour and the number of involved lymph nodes. Our results indicate that the alterations of multiple oncogenes are involved in the development of breast cancer and some of them may have prognostic importance for breast cancer patients.","title":"Quantitative detection of amplification of proto-oncogenes in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"8585979"}
