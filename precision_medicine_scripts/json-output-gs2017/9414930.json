Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a homogeneously well-enhanced circumscribed round mass of about 5 cm in diameter in the pineal region. Angiography demonstrated that the tumor was fed mainly by the bilateral middle meningeal arteries (MMAs), and preoperative intravascular embolization was performed through the bilateral MMAs using estrogen-alcohol and polyvinyl acetate. The tumor was very soft and easily totally resected via the right occipital transtentorial approach. Preoperative embolization is a very useful technique to facilitate removal of deep-seated tumors.","title":"Successful removal of meningioma of the pineal region after embolization.","pubmedId":"9414930"}
