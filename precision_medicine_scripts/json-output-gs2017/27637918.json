Given the possible key role of the ENS in PD pathophysiology, we undertook the current research to characterize the native state of α-synuclein in rat primary culture of ENS and in adult human healthy ENS. Using amine-reactive cross-linking, we showed that, by contrast to cell lines and brain neurons, α-synuclein exists primarily as a monomer in intact enteric neurons, suggesting that the native state of α-synuclein is different between the ENS and the brain. Our results provide new insights into the widely discussed concepts of α-synuclein aggregation and misfolding in PD and raise issue about the possible transmission of α-synuclein from the ENS to the brain.","title":"Cross-linking for the analysis of α-synuclein in the enteric nervous system.","pubmedId":"27637918"}
