With the aim of establishing personalized medicine for treatment of solid tumors, we focused on MET amplification in gastric cancer patients, given the extreme sensitivity to c-Met inhibitor in MET amplified gastric cancer cell lines. We tested MET amplification and activation of c-Met in various gastric cancer cell lines and tissue samples from 482 gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery. Gastric cancer cell lines with MET amplification by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and FISH predicted sensitivity to PHA-665,752, a selective c-Met kinase inhibitor. Of the 472 patients who had DNA sample available for qPCR analysis, 100 patients (21.2%) had a MET copy number greater than 4.0 copies and demonstrated poorer survival following curative surgery with statistical significance (5-year OS; 50.0 vs. 59.1%; MET amplification (+) vs. MET amplification (-); P \u003d 0.0134). These results suggest that the increased MET copy number measured by qPCR plays an important role in determining prognosis in gastric cancer patients. However, the predictive role of MET amplification for treatment response should be further explored in upcoming clinical trials.","title":"Impact of MET amplification on gastric cancer: possible roles as a novel prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target.","pubmedId":"21424128"}
