We assessed lung cancer specimens for caveolin-1 expression immunohistochemistry. A majority of the cell types in the lung and the bronchial epithelium normally exhibited positive staining for caveolin-1. In adenocarcinomas (ADs) of positive staining for caveolin-1, pT1 tumors exhibited significantly higher staining than pT2-pT4 tumors (P\u003d0.0240). In squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), pT1-pT2 tumors expressed significantly lower expression levels than pT3-pT4 tumors (P\u003d0.0175). In AD, loss of caveolin-1 may be essential for tumor extension and dedifferentiation. In contrast, caveolin-1 overexpression may be correlated with tumor extension in SCC.","title":"Difference of caveolin-1 expression pattern in human lung neoplastic tissue.
