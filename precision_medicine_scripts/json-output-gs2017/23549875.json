Although selective BRAF inhibitors are effective for treatment of melanoma, comparable efforts in CRC have been disappointing. Here, we investigated potential mechanisms underlying this resistance to BRAF inhibitors in BRAF(V600E) CRC.\nWe examined phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR signaling in BRAF(V600E) CRC cell lines after BRAF inhibition and cell viability and apoptosis after combined BRAF and PI3K/mTOR inhibition. We assessed the efficacy of in vivo combination treatment using a novel genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) for BRAF(V600E) CRC.\nWestern blot analysis revealed sustained PI3K/mTOR signaling upon BRAF inhibition. Our BRAF(V600E) GEMM presented with sessile serrated adenomas/polyps, as seen in humans. Combination treatment in vivo resulted in induction of apoptosis and tumor regression.\nWe have established a novel GEMM to interrogate BRAF(V600E) CRC biology and identify more efficacious treatment strategies. Combination BRAF and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor treatment should be explored in clinical trials.","title":"Concomitant BRAF and PI3K/mTOR blockade is required for effective treatment of BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"23549875"}
