The contribution of [14C]2-oxoglutarate to the synaptosomal synthesis of [14C]acetylcholine was found to be negligible despite evidence for its uptake and oxidation. The activity of the enzymes NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42), aconitate hydratase (EC 4.2.1.3), and ATP citrate-lyase (EC 4.1.3.8) were measured in the synaptosol. NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase and aconitate hydratase are present at three- to 1.5-fold higher activities than ATP citrate-lyase. It seems likely that these enzymes contribute to the metabolism of citrate and prevent detectable formation of cytosolic acetyl-CoA from exogenously added 2-oxoglutarate (or citrate). The data further suggest that ATP citrate-lyase may in part be associated with the mitochondrial fraction.","title":"2-Oxoglutarate: oxidation and role as a potential precursor of cytosolic acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of acetylcholine in rat brain synaptosomes.","pubmedId":"2493071"}
