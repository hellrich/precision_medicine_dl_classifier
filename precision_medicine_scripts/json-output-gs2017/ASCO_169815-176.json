We determined the association of molecular markers in the primary tumor with SAR in patients with stage III colon carcinomas treated with adjuvant FOLFOX-based chemotherapy in two clinical trials. Methods: In randomized trials of adjuvant FOLFOX  cetuximab (NCCTG N0147) or FOLFOX + bevacizumab (NSABP C-08), we determined the association of somatic BRAFV600E and KRAS exon 2 mutations and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status in colon adenocarcinomas with patient SAR. Cox models were utilized and adjusted for clinicopathological features and time-to-recurrence data. The interaction effect of the anatomic site of the primary tumor on the impact of biomarkers on SAR was determined. Results: Among patients with colon cancer recurrence [N0147 (N \u003d 871); C-08 (N \u003d 524)], those with tumors harboring mutant BRAFV600E had significantly worse SAR compared to those with non-mutated BRAF and KRAS genes [HR 2.45 (95% CI, 1.85-3.25, Padjusted\u003c .0001]. Mutant BRAFV600E was also associated with significantly poorer outcome for tumors with proficient (p) DNA mismatch repair (pMMR) [HR 2.64 (95% CI, 1.96-3.57), Padjusted\u003c .0001] and with deficient (d) MMR [HR 2.70 (95% CI, 1.23-5.93), Padjusted \u003d .014]. Significant interactions were found for MMR (P \u003d .027) and KRAS (P \u003d .014) status by primary tumor site for SAR, with significantly better SAR for dMMR tumors of the proximal vs distal colon [HR 0.57 (95% CI, 0.39-0.81), Padjusted \u003d .023], and significantly worse SAR for mutant KRAS tumors of the distal colon [codon Conclusions: Patients whose tumors harbored BRAFV600E mutations and were dMMR or pMMR had significantly shorter SAR. The significant adverse impact of KRAS mutations on SAR was limited to patients with distal cancers, indicating that KRAS should be interpreted by primary tumor site. These molecular markers may, therefore, inform patient management and treatment decisions at the time of tumor recurrence.
