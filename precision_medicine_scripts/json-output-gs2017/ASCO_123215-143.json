Currently platinum and gemcitabine-based therapy is the standard first-line treatment. EGFR inhibition has proven beneficial across a number of gastrointestinal malignancies; and has shown specific advantages among KRASwild-type genetic subtypes of colon cancer.  Methods:    Patients with histologically confirmed, previously untreated unresectable or metastatic KRAS wild type biliary tract or gallbladder adenocarcinoma with ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2 were eligible. Patients were treated with Panitumumab 6mg/kg, Gemcitabine (GEM) 1000 mg/m2 (10 mg/m2/min), Oxaliplatin (OX) 85 mg/m2on days 1 and 15 of each 28 day cycle. The primary objective was to determine the objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST criteria v.1.1. Secondary objectives were to evaluate toxicity, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival.  Results:    Of the 38 patients screened, 31 patients were found to have KRAS wild type genotype and enrolled.  The median age was 61 years old, 55% males, 100% of patients had an ECOG PS of  \u003c1. Twenty-five patients had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 3 each had extrahepatic and gall bladder carcinoma. Twenty-eight patients completed at least 2 cycles of therapy and were evaluable for response. The ORR was 50% (95% CI 23.8-76.2). With a median follow-up of 11 months, median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI, 3.8 - 23.9 months) and median OS was 24.8 months (95% CI, 9.0 months-no upper bound).  The most common grade 3 toxicities were fatigue 23%, anemia 23%, neuropathy 16%, elevated AST/ALT 16%, hyponatremia 13%, nausea 13%, rash 10%, neutropenia 7%, and hypomagnesemia 7%. Grade 4 toxicities included leukopenia 10%, and 1 case (3%) each of gallbladder perforation, hematoma, anemia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and hypokalemia.  Conclusions:    Completed analysis of this phase II study of GEMOX-panitumumab for KRAS wild type advanced BTC reveals encouraging results with promising response rates and PFS. The toxicity profiles were expected and manageable. Further investigation of this regimen and anti-EGFR therapy is warranted.
