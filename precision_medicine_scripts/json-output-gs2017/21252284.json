This study characterizes MET and HER expression and signaling in a panel of human tumor cell lines and the differential susceptibility of these cell lines to single agents or combinations of foretinib, a multikinase MET inhibitor, with HER-targeted agents, erlotinib or lapatinib. Most MET-amplified tumor lines without HER1 or HER2 amplification are sensitive to foretinib, whereas MET-amplified lines with HER1 or HER2 amplification are more sensitive to the combination of foretinib with lapatinib or erlotinib. Interestingly, MET-overexpressing tumor cell lines with HER1 or HER2 amplification also exhibited reduced sensitivity to lapatinib or erlotinib in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), indicating MET activation can decrease the effectiveness of HER1/2 inhibitors in some cell lines. Consistent with this observation, the effect of HGF on lapatinib or erlotinib sensitivity in these cells was reversed by foretinib, other MET inhibitors, or siRNA to MET. Western blot analyses showed that combining foretinib with erlotinib or lapatinib effectively decreased the phosphorylation of MET, HER1, HER2, HER3, AKT, and ERK in these cells. Furthermore, HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients treated with lapatinib who had higher tumor MET expression showed shorter progression-free survival (19.29 weeks in MET-high patients vs. 28.14 weeks in MET-low patients, P \u003c 0.0225). These data suggest that combination therapy with foretinib and HER-targeted agents should be tested as a treatment option for HER1- or HER2-positive patients with MET-amplified or -overexpressing tumors.","title":"Synergistic effects of foretinib with HER-targeted agents in MET and HER1- or HER2-coactivated tumor cells.","pubmedId":"21252284"}
