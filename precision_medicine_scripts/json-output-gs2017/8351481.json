We present a 75-year-old female patient with no previous history of urological disease in whom a renal pelvic tumour was diagnosed. Histological examination after radical nephroureterectomy proved the tumour to be a rare adenocarcinoma. The course of the disease, the possible predisposing factors, the treatment of the tumour and the prognosis are discussed.","title":"Adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis in an elderly woman.","pubmedId":"8351481"}
