Early stages and locally advanced cervical cancer are currently treated respectively with surgery and chemoradiation with good prognosis. Persistent, recurrent and metastatic cervical cancers have a poor prognosis. Angiogenesis has been identified as a crucial factor for cervical cancer growth. Recently, research has increasingly focused on the development of targeted therapies, such as anti-angiogenic drugs. Amongst such drugs, bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody has been the subject of extensive investigation, including its use in cervical cancer. This was recently approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic, recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer.\nThe aim of this review is to discuss the role of bevacizumab in both locally advanced and metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer and to analyze the studies that have led to the approval of bevacizumab in cervical cancer.\nThe use of bevacizumab in combination with other chemotherapies in cervical cancer has been proven safe and effective, with a significant improvement in overall survival of patients with advanced cervical cancer. Combination therapy using bevacizumab has been demonstrated to increase toxicity rates but it does not impair patient\u0027s quality of life.","title":"Bevacizumab for the treatment of cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"26796332"}
