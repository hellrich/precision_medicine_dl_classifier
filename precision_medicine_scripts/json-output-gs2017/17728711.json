The number of new cases diagnosed and the number of deaths each year are almost identical, demonstrating the particularly dismal prognosis for patients affected by this disease. Despite recent advances in the field of medical and radiation oncology, and the introduction of neoadjuvant and adjuvant regimens, surgery remains the single most important modality for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Surgery for pancreatic cancer is widely viewed as a complex procedure associated with considerable perioperative morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of surgery for pancreatic cancer, such as the extent of resection, the value of vascular resection, the use of laparoscopy, and the importance of treatment at high-volume centers, are currently under debate. This Review describes the current status of surgical treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and highlights the new developments in this field.","title":"Surgery insight: surgical management of pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"17728711"}
