The recent isolation of the NF2 gene on chromosome 22 allows the identification of somatic mutations in human tumors. We have searched for mutations of the NF2 gene in 331 primary human tumors using a screening method based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, which allows the detection of mutations in 95% of the coding sequence. Mutations were observed in 17 of 57 meningiomas and in 30 of 89 schwannomas. No mutations were observed for 17 ependymomas, 70 gliomas, 23 primary melanomas, 24 pheochromocytomas, 15 neuroblastomas, 6 medulloblastomas, 15 colon cancers, and 15 breast cancers. All meningiomas and one-half of the schwannomas with identified NF2 mutations demonstrated chromosome 22 allelic losses. We conclude that the involvement of the NF2 gene in human tumorigenesis may be restricted to schwannomas and meningiomas, where it is frequently inactivated by a two-hit process.","title":"Predominant occurrence of somatic mutations of the NF2 gene in meningiomas and schwannomas.","pubmedId":"7669741"}
