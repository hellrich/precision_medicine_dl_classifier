Diagnosing this rare tumor becomes even more difficult as the presentation of cardiac angiosarcomas varies based on anatomic location. Depending on the tumor\u0027s proximity to valves, symptoms may be more consistent with heart failure, while growth throughout the conduction system may produce arrhythmias.\nWe present the case of a young male with a significant tumor burden of cardiac angiosarcoma in his lungs whose symptoms included pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis. This patient did not have the classic finding of right-sided heart failure; instead, his presenting complaint was hemoptysis.\nThe diagnostician\u0027s differential diagnosis must be broad when encountering common chief complaints, such as hemoptysis and chest pain.","title":"Metastatic Cardiac Angiosarcoma in a 26-Year-Old Male.","pubmedId":"27660586"}
