Primary orbital liposarcomas are extremely rare, with less than 30 cases previously reported. Metastatic orbital liposarcomas are also extremely rare, with only a few cases documented in the literature. We report a new case of an orbital metastatic liposarcoma and review the literature.\nA 57-year-old man with a history 5 years before of myxoid liposarcoma on the right calf, completely surgically resected, was admitted for recent proptosis of the left eye. A computed tomographic scan revealed a heterogeneously enhancing, left orbital mass measuring 30x23x20 mm. The mass adhered to the internal medial muscle without extension to the optic nerve. A biopsy was taken, which showed typical aspects of myxoid liposarcoma. The patient underwent an orbital left exenteration after first refusing any proposed treatment.\nLiposarcoma metastatic to the orbit is exceptional. It should be suspected in a patient with exophthalmia caused by a space-occupying lesion and a history of liposarcoma.","title":"[Orbital metastasis of liposarcoma].","pubmedId":"18046268"}
