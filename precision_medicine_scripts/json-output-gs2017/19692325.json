Medical history included sickle cell trait. Urine analysis was positive for protein and blood. Metabolic profile, autoantibody screen, and complement levels were normal. Hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed an 41.8% HbS diagnostic of sickle cell trait. Creatinine clearance was normal and proteinuria was nonnephrotic. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan showed left proximal hydronephrosis. Urology follow-up was arranged and the differential included renal papillary necrosis, or renal cyst rupture. He presented 3 months later with sudden onset left flank pain and gross hematuria. Serum creatinine was 1.8 mg/dL. Computed tomography scan with contrast revealed innumerable lung lesions, an enlarged heterogenously enhancing left kidney, and retroperitoneal adenopathy. Ultrasound revealed an obstructed left collecting system and a 14-cm enlarged left kidney with no discrete mass. Testicular markers/ultrasound, upper/lower endoscopies were normal. Lung biopsy revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma positive for cytokeratin 7. Renal, sarcoma, and gastrointestinal markers were negative. By exclusion, it appeared that the patient had a carcinoma of unknown primary. However, with the clinical and personal history, a diagnosis of renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) was made. RMC is a rare and highly malignant tumor that should always be included in the differential of a patient with sickle cell disorder and hematuria. Renal biopsy typically fails to sample the renal medulla and radiologic findings might not raise the suspicion of a renal tumor. Thus, clinical suspicion must always be high in order to preserve the patient\u0027s only chance of prolonged survival.","title":"Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary in a 20-year-old African American male.","pubmedId":"19692325"}
