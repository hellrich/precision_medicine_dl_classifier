We have demonstrated in a murine model for prostate cancer that complete inactivation of the tumor suppressor Pten elicits a senescence response, which significantly opposes tumorigenesis (Chen ZB, Nature 2005). Here we characterize Pten loss induced cellular senescence (PICS) as a novel type of senescence. Additionally, we show that compounds which target PTEN and MDM-2 can be used alone or in combination to potentiate the senescence pathway in tumors of genetically engineered mouse (GEM) and human xenografts models. Methods: Cell growth inhibition, western blot analysis and senescence assay (SA) were performed on LnCAP, MDA-PCa2b and PC3 cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemestry analysis and SA were performed in murine tumors. Cells were incubated with the PTEN inhibitor VO-OHpic (V) and the MDM-2 inhibitor, Nutlin-3 (N) at doses including the IC50 for each drug and cell type. In vivo evaluation of V and N were done both in Pten null prostate conditional mice (Ptenpc-/-) and human xenograft models. Results: PICS, represents a distinct type of senescence response that can be targeted for cancer therapy. PICS occurs at early time points after Pten inactivation and in the absence of cellular proliferation and DNA damage. Importantly, we have identified and developed for cancer therapy a novel PTEN inhibitor. Pharmacological inhibition of PTEN drives senescence in vitro and inhibits tumourigenesis in vivo in a human xenograft model. We also find that PICS is associated with enhanced mTOR-dependent p53 translation. In agreement with these mechanistic findings, N dramatically potentiate senescence and strongly inhibits tumorigenesis in Ptenpc-/- mice. Combination of V and N acts synergistically in inducing senescence in vitro and reducing cell growth. Conclusions: Taken together, our data identify a type of cellular senescence that can be triggered in non-proliferating cells in the absence of DNA damage . On the basis of this concept, we define a molecular framework for \"pro-senescence\" therapy against cancer.","title":"PTEN and MDM2 inhibitors: Toward a novel pro-senescence therapy approach for patients with cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_52674-74"}
