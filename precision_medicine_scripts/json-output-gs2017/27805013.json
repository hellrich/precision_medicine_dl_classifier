{"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"In order to prevent cardiovascular endpoints, control of diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia is a necessity as those risk factors frequently occur in combination. Prevalence trends of concurrent diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in 36,673 subjects were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999-2012. The prevalence of concurrent diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia increased from 3% in 1999-2000 to 6.3% in 2011-2012 (P \u003c 0.001). The diabetes with concurrent hypertension or hypercholesterolemia incidences also increased significantly, while the occurrence of concurrent hypertension and hypercholesterolemia was stable over the study period. Overall medical drug treatments for concurrent diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia were improved from 69.8% in 1999-2006, to 82.4% in 2007-2012 (P \u003d 0.002). Treatment cost coverage rates in any combinations with diabetes were 79-82.4% and 90.7% in the subgroup of concurrent hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. General treatment goal achievement rates were \u003c25%, the lowest rate being 14.2% in the subject groups with three combined risk factors. The treatment goal achievement rates in two subgroups with concurrent diabetes were 20.1% (with hypertension) and 17% (with hypercholesterolemia) and 24.5% in the group without diabetes. Cost coverage improved in all combinations, but the general treatment goal achievement rates were low, especially in the groups with concurrent diabetes.","title":"Increasing trend of diabetes combined with hypertension or hypercholesterolemia: NHANES data analysis 1999-2012.","pubmedId":"27805013"}
