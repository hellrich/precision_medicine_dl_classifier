This represented 8.1% of all female cancers. Of these, 8.0% were below thirty years of age. The peak prevalence was found in the 35 to 44 year old age group. Both the peak prevalence and the high proportion of patients under thirty years suggest that the majority of breast cancer in Tanzania and also in other sub-Saharan African countries are younger than in the populations of North America and Europe. An attempt is made to determine whether this difference is real or is a statistical aberration based on population epidemiology or culture. Mastectomy, the treatment that is usually offered has severe psychological trauma to these young patients. Therefore, early detection of the disease with a breast conservation procedure is advocated.","title":"A comparative study of carcinoma of the breast in an African population.","pubmedId":"8062765"}
