Given the efficacy of EGFR TKIs in advanced EGFR-mutant lung cancer, adjuvant therapy with EGFR TKIs is also biologically appealing. However, there are conflicting findings to date regarding the potential benefit of adjuvant TKI in patients (pts) with lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations (Janjigian JTO 2010; Goss ASCO 2010) To better understand these results, we studied the natural history of EGFR-mutant lung cancers which recurred despite adjuvant TKI.  Methods: Pts with recurrent EGFR-mutant lung cancer were identified from an institutional database of pts who received adjuvant/neoadjuvant TKI using an IRB approved waiver. Recurrent cancer specimens, when available, were tested for the T790M resistance mutation. Sensitivity to retreatment with EGFR TKI was evaluated.  Results: 23 pts were identified; all cases had an EGFR mutation (61% exon 19 deletion, 35% L858R, 4% other). Pts received adjuvant/neoadjuvant TKI for a median of 19 total months (range 1-39 months); median time to progression (TTP) was 29 months. 8 pts recurred while receiving TKI; 7 of these cases were tested for T790M, which was detected in 4 (57%). 15 pts recurred after stopping TKI (median of 13 months off TKI); however, T790M was not detected in any of the 8 cases tested (p\u003d0.026, Fishers exact test). 13 pts who recurred after stopping TKI were retreated with a median TTP of 10 months. Radiographic response was seen in 8 of 10 pts (80%); 3 pts had no evaluable disease.  Conclusions: Pts with EGFR-mutant lung cancer who develop recurrence after stopping adjuvant TKI do not harbor T790M and commonly remain sensitive to TKI treatment. Recurrence of EGFR-mutant lung cancer after adjuvant TKI should not preclude a trial of TKI retreatment; a phase II trial of erlotinib in this setting is underway (NCT01189435). Studies of adjuvant TKI may underestimate the potential benefit for resected EGFR-mutant lung cancers if TKI retreatment at recurrence is not explicitly considered.
