Bmi1 is detected at higher levels in androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 than in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer (CaP) cells. Ectopic Bmi1 enhanced the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and suppressed the exression of p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) in CaP cells. Consistent with these observations, immunohistochemical staining of 51 cases of primary CaP specimens revealed 1.4 fold (p\u003d0.014) and 1.3 fold (p\u003d0.051) higher levels of Bmi1-positive cells in carcinoma compared to normal prostatic epithelial cells and PIN, respectively. In primary CaPs, Bmi1 expression was associated with a reduction in p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF). Furthermore, in comparison to empty vector-transfected cells, Bmi1-expressing DU145 cells formed significantly larger tumors in NOD/SCID mice. Taken together, we demonstrate that Bmi1 promotes prostate tumorigenesis.","title":"Bmi1 promotes prostate tumorigenesis via inhibiting p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) expression.","pubmedId":"18817867"}
