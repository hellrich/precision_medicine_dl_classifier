BRAF alterations in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) are rare and BRAF is not currently considered a target for the disease. Methods: DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections from a series of 10,428 cases of metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of \u003e 550X for up to 315 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Results: 135 (1.2%) of the mBC featured alterations in BRAF. The median age of the 135 female patients was 66 years (range 27 to 83 years). The primary tumor was used for CGP in 50 (37%) and from metastatic sites including lymph nodes, liver, bone, lung, brain, adrenal and soft tissue in 85 (67%). Using CDH1 mutation as the definition of lobular mBC, 126 (93%) were ductal and 9 (7%) were lobular histology. Activating BRAF alterations included amplifications (48%), SV mutations (39%) and rearrangements (13%). No (0%) mBC had multiple BRAF GA in the same case. 34% of BRAF SV were V600E and 66% were a wide variety of non-V600E GA. 10 (7.4%) of 135 BRAF mutated mBC featured ERBB2 amplification with 1 (1%) having an ERBB2 SV mutation and 1 (1%) having both ERBB2 amplification and SV GA. Of the 115 BRAF GA cases with known hormone receptor status 71 (62%) were ER negative, 44 (38%) were ER positive and 63 (55%) were triple negative (TNBC). Other targetable genes enriched in mBC with BRAF GA included CDK6 (p \u003d 0.001), HGF (p \u003c 0.001) and MET(p \u003c 0.001). The median TMB was 4.5 with 17 (13%) of cases with TMB \u003e 10 mut/Mb and 7 (5%) of cases with \u003e 20 mut/Mb. Conclusions:BRAF alterations, although uncommon in mBC representing only 1.2% of cases, are enriched in TNBC and feature both targetable base substitutions and rare fusions. BRAF GA may be a rare cause of anti-HER2 therapy resistance in a subset of ERBB2 driven mBC. Targetable genes co-altered with BRAF in mBC include CDK6, HGF and MET. The TMB in BRAF altered mBC is significantly higher than that for mBC in general and indicates potential role for immunotherapy for these patients.","title":"BRAF: An emerging target for triple-negative breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_182196-199"}
