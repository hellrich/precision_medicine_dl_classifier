The decrease in coronary flow reserve has, however, not been predictable previously. We postulated that flow reserve depression might be related to a left ventricular mass threshold. Seventy-two patients (82% with hypertension) with suspected ischemic heart disease who were found to be free of significant coronary artery disease at cardiac catheterization were evaluated utilizing the intracoronary Doppler catheter and two-dimensional directed M-mode echocardiography for determination of coronary flow reserve and left ventricular mass. For left ventricular mass indexed (LVMI) by body surface area (BSA) greater than or equal to 50% above normal using established gender-specific norms, American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and PENN methods (correction of LV mass by regression equation agreeing with necropsy estimates of mass) predicted impairment of flow reserve (p \u003d 0.005 and 0.009, respectively). Unindexed left ventricular mass and LVMI by height were not helpful in this regard. Using the ASE method for LV mass determination, coronary flow reserve was moderately depressed (2.4 +/- 1.0) for those with LVMI greater than or equal to 50% above normal; in comparison, flow reserve was normal (3.5 +/- 1.3) for those with LVMI less than 50% above normal. A rare patient was able to maintain a normal flow reserve when ASE- and Penn-indexed mass estimates were greater than or equal to 50% above normal, but only in the setting of a markedly elevated mean arterial pressure.","title":"Relationship of left ventricular mass to impairment of coronary vasodilator reserve in hypertensive heart disease.","pubmedId":"1826183"}
