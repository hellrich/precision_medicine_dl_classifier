Genotypes were determined in DNA from blood cells by PCR-RFLP. Cancer occurrence was strongly associated with the BRCA2 Met/1915Thr homozygous polymorphic variants, whereas heterozygous variant was associated with significant reduction in breast cancer risk. Gene-gene interaction between the BRCA2-Met1915Thr Thr/Thr and BRCA2-Met784Val Met/Met homozygous variants increased the risk. Therefore, the Met1915Thr polymorphism in the BRCA2 gene may be considered as an independent marker of breast cancer.","title":"Polymorphisms of the BRCA2 and RAD51 genes in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"16261408"}
