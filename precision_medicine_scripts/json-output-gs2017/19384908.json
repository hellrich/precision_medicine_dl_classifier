The actuarial 5-year overall survival rates in patients with invasive IPMN and ductal carcinoma were 40% and 18%, respectively (P \u003d 0.008). However, the actuarial 5-year survival rate of patients with invasive IPMN was only 27% for UICC stage II disease, although this was significantly higher than that of patients with UICC stage II ductal adenocarcinoma (P \u003d 0.049).\nInvasive IPMN has a favorable prognosis compared with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that is likely due to the less aggressive nature of the disease. However, the prognosis for cases of advanced invasive IPMN is not always favorable despite complete tumor resection.","title":"Invasive intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas: comparison with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19384908"}
