We describe an unusual case of clear cell meningioma occurring at the petro-clival region in a 5-year-old child. We further seek to determine the impact of several growth factors as well as the AKT1 mutation on the tumor growth pattern.\nA five-year-old girl was presented with a one-week history of cephalgia, ataxia, and left sided torticollis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a dumbbell-shaped homogeneously petro-clival gadolinium-enhancing mass. A staged operative approach was chosen, and a complete removal of the tumor was achieved. Due to recurrent tumor progression, the child underwent several tumor surgeries and two cranial radiations. None of the treatments were able to stop tumor progression. Consequently, the child died at the age of 14 after further extensive intracranial and extracranial tumor progression. The initial histological examination revealed a clear cell meningioma WHO grade II with an MIB-1 labeling index of \u003c1%, which gradually increased with every recurrence up to 10% by the last progression at the age of 13 years. Analogically, an increasing overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) was observed with each recurrence. The AKT1 (E17K) mutation in the tumor was not detectable in all investigated specimens.\nPediatric clear cell meningiomas WHO grade II are very rare. Our data demonstrate the progressive overexpression of EGF-, PDGF-, and VEGF-receptors in each recurrence, providing one of these receptors as targeted therapy in such cases. Further evaluation of these growth factors in clear cell meningioma is required to establish the optimal treatment of these aggressive tumors.","title":"A five year-old child with clear cell petro-clival meningioma: case report with clinical and histopathological long-term follow-up.","pubmedId":"26077595"}
