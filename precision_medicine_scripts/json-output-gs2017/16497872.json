All tumours were characterised by using immunohistochemistry and molecular genetics.\nAll seven patients were women and lacked an association to cancer-predisposing genetic syndromes. Four patients were smokers and one had non-hereditary chronic pancreatitis. Pathomorphologically, tumours in three patients displayed moderate differentiation and four showed poor differentiation including one adenosquamous carcinoma. All tumours showed overexpression of transforming growth factor beta1 and loss or significant reduction of Smad4. Accumulation of p53 and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were seen in five and four patients, respectively. No expression of p16, oestrogen hormone receptor or progesterone receptor was found. Mismatch repair gene products (MutL homologue 1 (MLH1), MSH2 and MSH6) were expressed in all tumours. Mutational analyses showed K-ras mutations in only three of the seven tumours.\nA large clinical, pathomorphological and genetic overlap of PDAC in young patients aged under 40 is seen with that in elderly patients. The existence of yet undefined initiating events of pancreatic carcinogenesis is suggested by the low rate of K-ras mutations, in at least a subgroup of young patients.","title":"Molecular characterisation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in patients under 40.","pubmedId":"16497872"}
