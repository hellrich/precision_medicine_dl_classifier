Baseline forearm vascular resistance was greater in the elderly group compared with the younger hypertensive men. However, forearm vascular resistance responses to selective unloading of low pressure cardiopulmonary baroreceptors were similar in the two groups. This finding suggests that normal vascular responses to the unloading of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors are preserved in subjects with advancing age and mild to moderate hypertension. Baseline plasma norepinephrine levels, as well as norepinephrine responses to lower body negative pressure, were comparable in the two groups. This finding suggests that, unlike normotensive subjects, essential hypertensive subjects do not have an age-related increase in sympathetic nervous system activity.","title":"Effect of advancing age on cardiopulmonary baroreceptor function in hypertensive men.","pubmedId":"3623680"}
