This type of resection can only be carried out if an ample oral safety margin is given. The margin should be at least 10 cm in the case of diffuse carcinoma, and no less than 6 cm in intestinal-type carcinoma. Thus, aboral subtotal resection is confined to smaller tumors, preferably those located in the antrum of the stomach. Lymph node dissection can and should be carried out in the case of subtotal resection. Aboral subtotal resection represents an adequate form of treatment, complying with the necessary oncological standards if the appropriate safety margin is chosen.","title":"[Indications for aboral subtotal resection].","pubmedId":"1493261"}
