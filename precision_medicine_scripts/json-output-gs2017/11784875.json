The response rate and survival did not differ significantly between patients assigned to receive cisplatin and paclitaxel and those assigned to receive any of the three experimental regimens. Treatment with cisplatin and gemcitabine was associated with a significantly longer time to the progression of disease than was treatment with cisplatin and paclitaxel but was more likely to cause grade 3, 4, or 5 renal toxicity (in 9 percent of patients, vs. 3 percent of those treated with cisplatin plus paclitaxel). Patients with a performance status of 2 had a significantly lower rate of survival than did those with a performance status of 0 or 1.\nNone of four chemotherapy regimens offered a significant advantage over the others in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","title":"Comparison of four chemotherapy regimens for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"11784875"}
