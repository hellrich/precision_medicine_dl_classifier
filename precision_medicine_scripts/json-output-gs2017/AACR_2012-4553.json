Current methodologies for detecting presence of ALK rearrangements are labor-intensive, costly, and not ideally suited for screening large number of patient samples. To allow for a sensitive, facile, and inexpensive methodology to detect EML4-ALK fusions, we developed a direct transcript profiling to detect common variants of EML4-ALK fusions. Experimental Design: Using a single multiplex assay, we simultaneously interrogated presence of EML4-ALK transcripts and ALK 3 over-expression in 8 ALK-positive and 22 ALK-negative NSCLC samples previously tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). For controls, we also tested ALK-positive cancer cells lines NCI-H3122 and NCI-H2228, and an ALK-negative cell line A549. Purified RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections was hybridized in duplicates to a biotinylated capture probe and a color-coded reporter probe designed to hybridize to sequences spanning EML4-ALK junction. In addition, multiple probes were created to hybridize within 5 and 3 regions of ALK transcript to detect discordant levels between the breakpoint, indicative of fusion event. Purified hybridization complexes are immobilized and aligned on a cartridge where a microscope CCD camera images and counts the molecular color-coded tags attached to reporter probes. The number of reporter counts corresponds to the number of transcripts being interrogated. Results: With this assay, we obtained 100% concordance in EML4-ALK fusion calls to results generated by FISH and IHC analyses. Similar findings were obtained for control cancer cell lines. The assay is highly reproducible and sensitive, detecting ALK-fusion transcripts even in samples with low tumor content. Using the combined strategy of fusion detection and ALK 5 and 3 transcript quantification, we were able to validate the status of one patient negative for ALK rearrangement by FISH but positive for ALK protein expression by IHC. Conclusions: We have developed a novel and sensitive methodology to screen for common EML4-ALK fusions in NSCLC. The assay is inexpensive, easy to perform, high-throughput and compatible with FFPE tissue samples. This is a promising technology highly suitable for screening large numbers of tumor samples without the need for cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification.","title":"Multiplexed, digital gene expression and fusion transcript analysis to screen for EML4-ALK positive lung cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-4553"}
