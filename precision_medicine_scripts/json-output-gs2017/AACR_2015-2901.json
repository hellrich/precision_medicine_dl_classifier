Emerging studies indicate that autophagy is involved in secretion through non-classical mechanisms. It is not well understood, however, how this secretory function modifies the molecular composition of the tumor secretome, which plays an important role in tumor growth and tumor immune responses. In this work, we focused on the role of both basal and BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)-induced autophagy in melanoma cells harboring BRAF V600E, a missense mutation observed in 60% of melanoma tumors. Using quantitative proteomics we previously showed that a small number of proteins were differentially secreted by low and high autophagy melanoma cells grown in three-dimensional culture. Secreted proteins associated with high autophagy included IL-1, IL-8, LIF, FAM3C, and DKK3, which have known roles in tumorigenesis. Further, serum collected from untreated metastatic melanoma patients with high tumor autophagy levels exhibited higher levels of these proteins than serum from low autophagy patients. In the current study, melanoma cells with high autophagy and the BRAF V600E mutation (1205Lu) were treated with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), PLX4720+HCQ, and the autophagy inducer rapamycin. The increase in autophagic flux upon the addition of PLX4720 or rapamycin was confirmed by western blotting and tandem fluorescently tagged LC3 (mCherry-eGFP-LC3). Secretomes were compared using quantitative proteomics, which resulted in identification of 1154 proteins with a false discovery rate of less than 1%. Hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis showed that secretomes from cells treated with the autophagy inducers rapamycin or PLX4720 correlated more closely with each other than those treated with HCQ either alone or in combination. A panel of proteins involved in extracellular matrix modification, cell-cell adhesion, and inflammation (including FAM3C and LIF) significantly increased in the supernatants of cells treated with PLX4720 or rapamycin and decreased in supernatants from cells treated with HCQ or HCQ+PLX4720. These results demonstrate that autophagy plays an active role in modifying the molecular composition of the tumor secretome. Proteins specifically shed in response to BRAF inhibitors and/or autophagy inhibition may have utility in the clinic for diagnostic and pharmacodynamic applications.","title":"The role of basal and BRAF inhibitor-induced autophagy-driven secretion in remodeling the melanoma tumor secretome","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2901"}
