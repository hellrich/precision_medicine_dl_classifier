Case 1: A 44-year-old man was diagnosed with multiple liver metastases after resection of cecal cancer. UFT (500 mg/day)/Leucovorin (75 mg/day) was administered. Metastatic lesions of the liver completely disappeared on computed tomography(CT)one month after chemotherapy. Grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia and grade 1 diarrhea, pigmentation and rash were recognized. No signs of recurrence were observed for 35 months. Case 2: A 66-year-old man who underwent left colectomy and partial hepatectomy for transverse colon cancer and descending colon cancer with liver metastasis was determined to have multiple lung metastases. UFT/LV therapy was started. The lung lesions became only scars 7 months later. Adverse events were not seen. No other recurrence was found over 20 months. Case 3: A 66- year-old woman was detected with a lymph node recurrence after surgery for rectal cancer. CT revealed the disappearance of the tumor after 7 courses of UFT/LV therapy. Grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia appeared. Recurrence was not observed for 22 months, and the treatment has been discontinued.","title":"[Three cases of complete response after treatment with UFT and leucovorin for recurrent colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"19011350"}
