These translocations, activating a proto-oncogene with a tyrosine kinase domain, are also targeted by the MET and ALK crizotinib. ROS1 rearrangements are found in only 1.2-1.7% NSCLCs, but seemingly only in triple negative (EGFR and KRAS non-mutated and ALK non-rearranged) adenocarcinomas and preferentially in non- or light smokers.  Methods:  60 triple negative non- or light-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma were screened for ROS1 rearrangements by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Two commercially available break-apart FISH probe kits containing a mixture of two probes hybridizing on each side of the ROS1 locus, one located in a centromeric (3) position, and the other one in a telomeric (5) position relative to the ROS1 gene were used. ROS1 fusions were therefore detected without any preconception on the fusion partner, as multiple fusion partners have been described. At least 100 nuclei were screened, and a tumor was considered positive if it contained more than 15% rearranged nuclei.  Results:  Forty-nine of the 60 tumors were interpretable. Four (8.2%) of theses 49 tumors were ROS1 rearranged by FISH. Only one of the positive cases showed a classical split rearrangement pattern (one fusion, one green and one red signal in more than 15% of nuclei), whereas the three other tumors showed a variant pattern, with a deletion of the telomeric probe, located in a 5 position relative to the ROS1 gene locus, indicating the presence of a fusion partner upstream of the ROS1 gene. The four positive cases were all at an advanced stage (3 or 4), but did not display any common architectural feature.  Conclusions:  The prevalence of ROS1 positivity in our selected population was far superior (8.2%) to that of a non-selected NSCLC population, suggesting that this type of screening may be more effective (faster and more cost-worthy) to detect ROS1 positive tumors.","title":"Detection of ROS1 translocations in triple-negative lung adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"ASCO_116245-132"}
