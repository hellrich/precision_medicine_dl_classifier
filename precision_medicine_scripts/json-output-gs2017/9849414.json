The current review was undertaken to determine whether strategies applied for the evaluation and treatment of breast cancer in females are appropriate in male breast cancer. Male breast cancer has biological differences compared with female breast cancer, including a high prevalence in certain parts of Africa, a higher incidence of oestrogen receptor positivity and more aggressive clinical behaviour. It responds to hormonal manipulation and chemotherapy, but optimal treatment regimens in males are unknown. Male breast cancer remains an uncommon disease. Most of our current knowledge regarding its biology, natural history and treatment strategies has been extrapolated from its female counterpart. Much research is needed to further characterise the molecular biological properties of male breast tumours and their prognostic significance, and to devise treatment strategies, including optimal chemotherapy regimens.","title":"Male breast cancer: a review of the literature.","pubmedId":"9849414"}
