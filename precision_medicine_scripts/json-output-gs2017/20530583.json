We used global gene expression profiling and epigenetic treatment of pancreatic cell lines including pancreatic cancer cell lines, pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts, and cell lines derived from nonneoplastic pancreata. We examined expression and epigenetic alterations of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 in pancreatic cancers and normal pancreas and performed proliferation, knockdown, and coculture experiments to understand the role of stromal sources of prostaglandins for pancreatic cancers. We identify COX-1 as a gene under epigenetic regulation in pancreatic cancers. We find that COX-1 expression is absent in many pancreatic cancer cells and some of these cancers also lack COX-2 expression. Suspecting that such cancers must rely on exogenous sources of prostaglandins, we show that pancreatic cancer stromal cells, such as fibroblasts expressing COX-1 and COX-2, are a likely source of prostaglandins for pancreatic cancer cells deficient in COX. Knocking down the prostaglandin transporter multidrug resistance-associated protein-4 in fibroblasts suppresses the proliferation of cocultured pancreatic cancer cells lacking COX. Pancreatic cancers that lack COX can use exogenous sources of prostaglandins. Blocking multidrug resistance-associated protein-4 may be a useful therapeutic strategy to deplete COX-deficient pancreatic cancers of prostaglandins.","title":"Cyclooxygenase-deficient pancreatic cancer cells use exogenous sources of prostaglandins.","pubmedId":"20530583"}
