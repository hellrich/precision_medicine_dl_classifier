P65 levels were higher in cancer with metastases to lymph nodes and distant metastases. Higher levels were observed in more advanced cases classified as III and IV according to pTNM classification. In two groups of patients with vessel invasion and absence of lymphocytes in tumour tissue, the presence of P65 expression correlated with shorter survival time. Quantitative results confirmed that P65 gene expression in colon cancer is engaged in the process of metastasis formation and could be correlated with worse prognosis for the patients.","title":"Quantitative analysis of the p65 gene expression in patients with coloroctal cancer.","pubmedId":"23675055"}
