We evaluated subjects with COPD and computed tomographic (CT) scan evidence of emphysema to determine the biomarker profile associated with a bronchodilator response.\nWe investigated whether subjects with COPD and a bronchodilator response had increased levels of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid eosinophil biomarkers, T(H)2 cytokines, CC chemokines, and serum allergen-specific IgE.\nAll patients with COPD and control subjects (n \u003d 31) had chest CT scans to detect emphysema and subsequent pulmonary function studies, BAL for biomarkers, and serum IgE measurements.\nCT scan score, FEV(1), carbon monoxide single-breath diffusion capacity, and BAL fluid neutrophil biomarker levels were similar in subjects with COPD who had or did not have a bronchodilator response of greater than 12%. In contrast, levels of BAL fluid eosinophil biomarkers (eosinophil cationic protein [ECP] and eotaxin-1) were greater in patients with COPD with a bronchodilator response, whereas T(H)2 cytokines were not detectable in any patients with COPD. BAL fluid ECP and eotaxin-1 levels correlated with CT scan extent of emphysema. Immunostaining of COPD lung sections from a separate cohort of subjects with COPD and healthy subjects demonstrated epithelial expression of eotaxin-1 but no lung expression of IL-4 or IL-5.\nSubjects with COPD diagnosed on the basis of the presence of emphysema on CT scan who have a bronchodilator response have increased levels of BAL ECP and eotaxin-1 but not T(H)2 cytokines.\nEosinophil biomarkers (ECP-1 and eotaxin-1) might identify a subset of subjects with COPD with emphysema on CT scans who have a bronchodilator response and an increased extent of emphysema on CT scanning.","title":"Computed tomographic scan-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-emphysema: eotaxin-1 is associated with bronchodilator response and extent of emphysema.","pubmedId":"17983873"}
