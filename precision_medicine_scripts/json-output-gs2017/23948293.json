In this issue of Cancer Cell, Kollmann and colleagues demonstrate that CDK6 performs a kinase-independent transcriptional function in regulating expression of VEGF-A and p16INK4a. These observations link the cell cycle machinery and angiogenesis and reveal the presence of a fail-safe antiproliferative mechanism.","title":"The kinase-independent, second life of CDK6 in transcription.","pubmedId":"23948293"}
