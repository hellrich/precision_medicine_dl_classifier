Target cell lysis was the same for patient groups with benign (n \u003d 13) and malignant (n \u003d 47) breast disease (27% versus 36% mean chromium release; target:effector ratio 40:1 for K 562 and 28% versus 40% for MCF-7 cells). NK activity as defined by short-term lysis of K 562 cells did not correlate with MCF-7 cell lysis in long-term assays for the carcinoma patients. This functional heterogeneity of natural cytotoxic activities of breast cancer patients was confirmed by a different age distribution for K 562 and MCF-7 cell lysis and high levels of MCF-7-directed NK activity in the grade I tumor group (56.2%). Our results indicate that measurement of peripheral blood NK activity against a breast carcinoma-derived cell line (MCF-7) defines a disease-related natural cytotoxic activity which correlates better with prognostic tumor parameters (tumor grading) than NK activity as defined by the lysis of K 562 erythroleukemic cells. NK activity testing against breast carcinoma cell lines should be used to monitor natural cytotoxic activities in breast cancer patients and its modulation by different routes of treatment.","title":"Natural killer cell activities of patients with breast cancer against different target cells.","pubmedId":"3350852"}
