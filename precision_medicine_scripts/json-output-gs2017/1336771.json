Six of 31 evaluable patients (19%) achieved a partial response. The major toxic effects from this regimen were myelosuppression, nausea/vomiting, and skin rash. We conclude that this well-tolerated schedule of trimetrexate has significant activity as a single agent against non-small cell lung cancer.","title":"Phase II trial of trimetrexate for unresectable or metastatic non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"1336771"}
