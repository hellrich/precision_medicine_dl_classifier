Little is known about clinicopathologic differences between lung cancer with EGFR gene major and other minor mutations. Methods: In National Cancer Center Hospital East, EGFR gene mutations were examined in 593 lung cancer patients between November 2005 and July 2009, and 31 patients with minor mutations (16% of all patients with EGFR gene mutations) were identified. EGFR gene mutations were analyzed by direct sequence or PCR-Invader method. Results: Thirty patients had point mutations in exon 18-21 and one had deletion in exon 18. Eleven patients had both minor and major mutations (7 with exon 19 deletions and 4 with exon 21 L858R). There were 19 males and 12 females, 22 smokers and 9 non-smokers, and 24 with adenocarcinomas and 7 with non-adenocarcinomas. The proportion of males (61%), smokers (71%), non-adenocarcinomas (23%) was significantly higher than that with major mutations. Gefitinib was administered to 9 patients with these minor mutations and only 3 patients, all had both minor and major mutations, showed clinical responses. Other 6 patients were not responded to gefitinib. Conclusions: The lung cancer patients with EGFR gene minor mutations had apparently different clinicopathologic characteristics from those with major mutations and it is possible that the minor mutation is associated with resistance to EGFR-TKI.","title":"Clinicopathologic differences between lung cancer with EGFR gene major (exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R) and other minor mutations.","pubmedId":"ASCO_49700-74"}
