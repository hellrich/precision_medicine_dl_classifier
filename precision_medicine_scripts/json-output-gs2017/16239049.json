Akt activity is up regulated in Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD) brain in parallel to the progression of neurofibrillary pathology. The present study determined whether altered expression of PTEN occurs in Alzheimer\u0027s disease brain. Western immunoblotting revealed no significant changes of PTEN protein levels in nuclear and membrane fractions of medial temporal cortex from a series of Alzheimer\u0027s disease and control cases. Similarly, no changes in PTEN protein levels, as determined by dot-blotting, were seen in temporal cortex homogenates from a separate series of Alzheimer\u0027s disease and control brains. A small but significant decrease in the levels of Ser(380) p-PTEN was seen in homogenates of Alzheimer\u0027s disease temporal cortex. Immunohistochemistry revealed PTEN immunoreactivity in a number of brain structures including neurons, capillaries and structures resembling oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. The majority of temporal cortex pyramidal neurons (93-100%) were PTEN immunopositive. The Alzheimer\u0027s disease cases had significantly lower numbers of total ( approximately 12% loss, P\u003c0.02) and PTEN immunopositive ( approximately 15% loss, P\u003c0.01) pyramidal neurons as compared to the control cases.","title":"PTEN levels in Alzheimer\u0027s disease medial temporal cortex.","pubmedId":"16239049"}
