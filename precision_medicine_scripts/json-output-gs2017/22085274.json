The targeted knockdown of EGFR by small hairpin RNA not only inhibited growth of H292 xenograft but also inhibited H1975 lung cancer cell and xenograft, which bore L858R/T790M EGFR and was resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These data demonstrated that small hairpin RNA was an effective therapy against mutant EGFR-expressing cancer cells and thus considered to be a promising strategy in the treatment of lung cancers.","title":"Suppression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression by small hairpin RNA inhibits the growth of human nonsmall cell lung cancers bearing wild-type and mutant EGFR.","pubmedId":"22085274"}
