From 1975 the pterional approach was performed on 20 patients with olfactory meningioma, with good results in 90% of cases. This approach presents several advantages over bifrontal craniotomy and, in order to minimise surgical damage, it avoids planned sacrifice of venous vessels.","title":"Venous saving in olfactory meningioma\u0027s surgery.","pubmedId":"10622451"}
