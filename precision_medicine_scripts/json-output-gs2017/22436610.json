This especially applies to ErbB2-ErbB3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-ErbB3 heterodimers providing anti-apoptotic signaling. Relatively little is understood about the signaling of EGFR-ErbB3 heterodimers and especially about mechanisms involved in downregulation of ErbB3 from the plasma membrane. This is in contrast to EGFR homodimers, for which trafficking has been extensively characterized. In the present study, we have investigated mechanisms involved in endocytosis of ErbB3 in porcine aortic endothelial cells stably expressing either ErbB3 only or stably expressing ErbB3 and EGFR. Our data show that ErbB3 is endocytosed in the absence of added ligand, independently of its tyrosine phosphorylation state and in a clathrin-dependent manner. Functional EGFR-ErbB3 heterodimers were observed to be formed, and dimerization with ErbB3 was observed to negatively affect endocytosis of the EGFR.","title":"The oncoprotein ErbB3 is endocytosed in the absence of added ligand in a clathrin-dependent manner.","pubmedId":"22436610"}
