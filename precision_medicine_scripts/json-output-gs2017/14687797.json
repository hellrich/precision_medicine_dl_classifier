Additionally, LKB1 physically associates with p53 and regulates p53-dependent apoptotic pathways. To investigate whether genetic alterations of LKB1 could be involved in the tumorigenesis of HCC, we analysed the genetic alterations of the LKB1 and p53 genes in seven dysplastic nodules and 80 HCCs. We found one LKB1 missense mutation, CCG--\u003eCTG (Pro--\u003eLeu) at codon 281 within the kinase domain. We also found allelic loss in six of 27 (22%) informative HCC cases and all of them were HBV-positive cases. In addition, we detected seven missense, one nonsense and one silent mutations (nine of 80, 11%) of p53 in HCCs only. These results suggest that genetic alterations of the LKB1 or p53 genes may play an important role in tumour development or progression of a sub-set of HCCs, and may also provide alternative mechanisms to protect the HCC cell from p53-dependent apoptosis.","title":"Genetic analysis of the LKB1/STK11 gene in hepatocellular carcinomas.","pubmedId":"14687797"}
