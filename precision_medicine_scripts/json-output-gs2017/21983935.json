This study was conducted to address how these alterations contribute to development and progression of this highly chemoresistant form of ovarian cancer. We histologically reviewed 21 previously described MET amplification-positive clear-cell adenocarcinoma cases, and selected 11 tumors with synchronous endometriosis and 2 tumors with adjacent clear-cell adenofibroma (CCAF) components. Using double in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, copy number alterations of the MET gene and levels of MET protein expression were analyzed in these putative precursor lesions and the corresponding invasive carcinoma components in this selected cohort. All of the non-atypical precursor lesions analyzed (ie, non-atypical endometrioses and the benign CCAFs) were negative for MET gain. However, low-level (≥3 MET copies in ≥10% and ≥4 MET copies in 10-40% of tumor cells) gain of MET was detected in 4 (40%) of the 10 atypical endometrioses and 1 of the 2 borderline CCAFs. Moreover, high-level (≥4 MET copies in ≥40% of tumor cells) gain of MET were detected in five (50%) of the atypical endometrioses. In 4 (31%) of the 13 cases enrolled, intratumoral heterogeneity for MET gain was documented in invasive carcinoma components, wherein all the relatively differentiated carcinoma components showed low-level gain of MET and all the corresponding poorly differentiated carcinomas showed high-level gain. The overall incidence of MET overexpression gradually increased from the precursors of non-atypical form (0%), through those of atypical form (67%) and the relatively differentiated carcinoma components (92%), to the poorly differentiated carcinoma components (100%). These results suggest that accumulative MET gene copy number alterations causing MET overexpression are associated with higher tumor grade and might drive the development and progression of the MET amplification-positive ovarian clear-cell adenocarcinoma.","title":"Accumulative copy number increase of MET drives tumor development and histological progression in a subset of ovarian clear-cell adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"21983935"}
