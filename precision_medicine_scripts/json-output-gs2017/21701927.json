The protocol was modified to include an optional 9 day break in the middle of chemoradiation. Quality of life was assessed by use of validated instruments.\nTwenty-eight patients were eligible for analysis. The operation of 15 (54%) patients was performed at other institutions. All patients had T3 tumors, 22 (79%) had positive lymph nodes and 4 (14%) had positive (R1) margins. 24 (86%) patients completed therapy. In all, 25 (89%) patients experienced grade 3 toxicity and 3 (11%) patients were hospitalized. The most common grade 3 events were leukopenia (15, 54%) and neutropenia (12, 43%). No grade 4 toxicity occurred. Overall quality of life decreased during chemoradiation but returned to baseline thereafter and was stable throughout surveillance. 19 patients have died; the median follow-up of the 9 survivors is 62 months. The median OS duration of treated patients was 42.3 (95% confidence interval 30.5-54.2) months.\nAdjuvant interferon-based chemoradiation can be delivered safely and tolerably-though with substantial reversible toxicity-to patients of good performance status at an experienced cancer center. Therapy may be associated with an improvement in overall survival.","title":"Survival and quality of life of patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with adjuvant interferon-based chemoradiation: a phase II trial.","pubmedId":"21701927"}
