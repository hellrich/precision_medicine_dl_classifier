No or very few sporadic breast tumors have been shown to harbor mutations in the coding sequence of BRCA1 or BRCA2. In contrast to normal breast epithelial cells, BRCA1 mRNA levels in tumors appeared to be down-regulated by methylation, while BRCA2 showed significant overexpression in sporadic breast cancers. We report herein an infantile gynecomastia in a two-year-old boy, studied by immunohistochemistry of anti-BRCA1 and anti-BRCA2 antibodies. We demonstrated that BRCA1 proteins, like BRCA2, are widely expressed in the nuclei of epithelial cells surrounding the lumen of the ducts in infantile gynecomastia. The intensive nuclear staining of both proteins in the mammary tissues means that BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are largely expressed in infantile gynecomastia.","title":"Differential expressions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in infantile gynecomastia.","pubmedId":"15015615"}
