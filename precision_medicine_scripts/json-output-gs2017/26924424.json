Recently, a BRAF-V600E mutation-specific antibody has become available for immunohistochemistry. Here, we investigated for the first time the prognostic impact of BRAF-V600E protein expression in primary melanoma.\nIn a patient series of 248 nodular melanomas, BRAF-V600E and total BRAF expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarray sections of paraffin-embedded archival tissue. Mutation status was assessed by real-time PCR in cases with sufficient tumour tissue (n\u003d191).\nPositive BRAF-V600E expression was present in 86 (35%) of the cases, and was significantly associated with increased tumour thickness, presence of tumour ulceration and reduced survival. Further, BRAF-V600E expression was an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis, whereas BRAF mutation status was not significant. There was 88% concordance between BRAF-V600E expression and mutation status.\nOur findings indicate that BRAF-V600E expression is a novel prognostic marker in primary melanoma.","title":"BRAF-V600E expression in primary nodular melanoma is associated with aggressive tumour features and reduced survival.","pubmedId":"26924424"}
