Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired resistance to ceritinib is not well defined. This study set out to clarify the mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end, ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib. H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway activation. Further, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the sensitivity to ceritinib.\nThis study proposes a preclinical rationale to use ALK-TKIs and afatinib combination therapy for ALK- translocated lung cancers that have acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs through EGFR pathway activation.","title":"Overcoming EGFR bypass signal-induced acquired resistance to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors in ALK-translocated lung cancer.","pubmedId":"27707887"}
