There were 6 cases of mutation for exon 5, and the mutation rate was 15%. In 2 cases, 1 base pair insertion TT--\u003eTAT in codon 85, while in other two cases, 1 base pair deletion GCA--\u003eGC in codon 86, and the two type mutation may result in frame shift mutation. One case had the above two type mutation simultaneously, which may result in missense mutation; 1 case had 1 base pair insertion TT--\u003eTAT in 85 codon and 1 base pair deletion GCA--\u003eGA, which may result in nonsense mutation. The pathology of 3/6 (50%) cases was low differentiation, and the others (3/6, 50%) were middle differentiation. Five cases had lymphatic metastasis, and the rate of which was 83.3%; the other one had no lymphatic metastasis, and the rate of which was 16.7%. There was only 1 case mutation for exon 8, and the mutation rate was 2.5%. One base pair deletion AAA--\u003eAA in 276 codon as well as 1 base pair insertion CT--\u003eCCT between the 336 codon and 337 codon may result in frame shift mutation. The pathology of the case was low differentiation.\nThe codon 85,86 of PTEN gene in exon 5 may be \"hot spots\" in LSCC and the mutation of PTEN gene may be related with the lymphatic metastasis and middle or low differentiation.","title":"[Detection of mutation in exon 5 and exon 8 of PTEN in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma].","pubmedId":"15127561"}
