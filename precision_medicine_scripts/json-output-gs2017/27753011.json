The genomic landscape of the PDAC genome features four frequently mutated genes (KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4) and dozens of candidate driver genes altered at low frequency, including potential clinical targets. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a promising resource to detect molecular characteristics of tumors, supporting the concept of \"liquid biopsy\".We determined the mutational status of KRAS in plasma cfDNA using multiplex droplet digital PCR in 259 patients with PDAC, retrospectively. Furthermore, we constructed a novel modified SureSelect-KAPA-Illumina platform and an original panel of 60 genes. We then performed targeted deep sequencing of cfDNA in 48 patients who had â‰¥1 % mutant allele frequencies of KRAS in plasma cfDNA.Droplet digital PCR detected KRAS mutations in plasma cfDNA in 63 of 107 (58.9 %) patients with inoperable tumors. Importantly, potentially targetable somatic mutations were identified in 14 of 48 patients (29.2 %) examined by cfDNA sequencing.Our two-step approach with plasma cfDNA, combining droplet digital PCR and targeted deep sequencing, is a feasible clinical approach. Assessment of mutations in plasma cfDNA may provide a new diagnostic tool, assisting decisions for optimal therapeutic strategies for PDAC patients.","title":"Clinical Utility of Circulating Tumor DNA for Molecular Assessment and Precision Medicine in Pancreatic Cancer.","pubmedId":"27753011"}
