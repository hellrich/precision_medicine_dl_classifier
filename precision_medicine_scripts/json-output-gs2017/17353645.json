In July, recurrence was detected in the right pelvis and left upper abdomen; therefore, we resected the tumor. In September 2004, computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple recurrences in the right lower abdomen, left upper abdomen, front of the left lobe of the liver, and at the back of the stomach. In October 2004, we started mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine therapy (MAID); however, after 1 course, the disease progressed, and the patient developed edema in the bilateral legs due to inferior vena cava (IVC) compression. In November 2004, we started weekly paclitaxel therapy (100 mg/m(2), once a week for 3 weeks followed by 1 drug-free week). CT revealed no change as a result of chemotherapy; however, IVC compression had improved, and leg edema had decreased. In August 2005, chemotherapy was stopped; therefore,the patient\u0027s condition worsened. She died in September 2005. We performed weekly paclitaxel therapy for the patient with recurrent liposarcoma. This improved her symptoms and quality of life (QOL). Therefore,we consider weekly paclitaxel therapy to be effective for liposarcoma treatment.","title":"[Weekly paclitaxel therapy is curative for patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma].","pubmedId":"17353645"}
