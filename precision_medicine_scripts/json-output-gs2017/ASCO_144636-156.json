Furthermore, there is still a need for serial monitoring of EGFR mutations and detection of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistance. We hypothesized that plasma-based EGFR mutation analysis may be feasible for monitoring response to EGFR TKIs and could be used to predict the resistance.  Methods:    From February 2012 through April 2014, 200 EGFR mutant NSCLC patients were enrolled and treated with EGFR TKIs (141 patients for gefitinib, 46 patients for erlotinib, and 13 patients for afatinib). Plasma samples were prospectively obtained every 2 months from baseline until disease progression. The longitudinally collected plasma samples (n \u003d 277) from 61 patients who progressed were analyzed using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). We identified an association between serial EGFR mutant titers in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples and the patients clinical response to EGFR TKIs. Results:    Of a total 60 baseline cfDNA samples available for ddPCR, 40 (67%) samples demonstrated same mutation in the matched tumors (i.e. sensitivity: 65% (13/20) for L858R vs 68% (27/40) for exon 19 deletions). The concordance rate of plasma with tissue results of EGFR mutation was 88% for L858R and 78% for exon 19 deletion, respectively. All the samples showing EGFR mutations in plasma showed a dramatic decrease of mutant copies (greater than 50%) in blood in the first 2 months after treatment. We also found the secondary mutation (T790M) emerged in 15 patients around 3~13 months after treatment and can be detected before disease progression as determined by CT scan. Correlation between the tumor volume and the level of cfDNA EGFR mutations will be updated.  Conclusions:    These results suggest that ddPCR is an appropriate method for determining plasma-based EGFR mutation status and may aid in monitoring response to EGFR TKIs and early detection of EGFR TKIs resistance.
