We analyzed the incidence of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI) status and loss of the DNA repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and MGMT in a series of 89 SAC, 81 matched conventional carcinomas (CC) and 13 sporadic colorectal cancer showing histological and molecular features of high-level MSI (sMSI-H). Our results demonstrate that KRAS are more prevalent than BRAF mutations in SAC (42.7% vs. 25.8%; p \u003d 0.011) being the KRAS-mutated cases even more abundant in SAC displaying adjacent serrated adenomas (51%). G12D and E545K are the most common KRAS and PIK3CA mutations found in SAC, respectively. SAC show higher frequency of MGMT loss compared to CC (50.6% vs. 25.3%; p \u003d 0.001) especially in distal colon/rectum (60.0% vs. 21.6%; p \u003d 0.0009). SAC differ from sMSI-H in terms of KRAS and BRAF mutation prevalence, MSI status and MLH1 expression (p \u003d 0.0003, p \u003c 0.0001, p \u003c 0.0001, p \u003c 0.001, respectively). SACs are more often KRAS-mutated and microsatellite stable and display different molecular and immunohistochemical characteristics compared to CC and sMSI-H.","title":"Colorectal serrated adenocarcinoma shows a different profile of oncogene mutations, MSI status and DNA repair protein expression compared to conventional and sporadic MSI-H carcinomas.","pubmedId":"22287190"}
