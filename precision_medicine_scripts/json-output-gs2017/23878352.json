MSI and BRAF mutation analyses are routinely used for familial cancer risk assessment. To clarify clinical outcome associations of combined MSI/BRAF subgroups, we investigated survival in 1253 rectal and colon cancer patients within the Nurses\u0027 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study with available data on clinical and other molecular features, including CIMP, LINE-1 hypomethylation, and KRAS and PIK3CA mutations. Compared with the majority subtype of microsatellite stable (MSS)/BRAF-wild-type, MSS/BRAF-mutant, MSI-high/BRAF-mutant, and MSI-high/BRAF-wild-type subtypes showed multivariable colorectal cancer-specific mortality hazard ratios of 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] \u003d1.12 to 2.28; P \u003d .009), 0.48 (95% CI \u003d 0.27 to 0.87; P \u003d .02), and 0.25 (95% CI \u003d 0.12 to 0.52; P \u003c .001), respectively. No evidence existed for a differential prognostic role of BRAF mutation by MSI status (P(interaction) \u003e .50). Combined BRAF/MSI status in colorectal cancer is a tumor molecular biomarker for prognosic risk stratification.","title":"Microsatellite instability and BRAF mutation testing in colorectal cancer prognostication.","pubmedId":"23878352"}
