Thus, the molecular diagnosis of KRAS and BRAF mutations is clinically important in therapeutic decision making. However, the frequency of KRAS and BRAF mutations in ESCCs remains inconclusive because of the limited sample sizes of previous studies (all N â‰¤ 80). Pyrosequencing is a nonelectrophoretic nucleotide extension sequencing technology that can be used for mutation testing.\nThe frequency of KRAS and BRAF mutations was examined using a nonbiased database of 203 resected ESCCs and a high-throughput pyrosequencing assay.\nThe validity of the KRAS pyrosequencing method was initially demonstrated by detection of all 4 types of KRAS mutations [c.35G\u003eT (codon 12 GGT\u003eGTT), c.35G\u003eA (codon 12 GGT\u003eGAT), c.34G\u003eT (codon 12 GGT\u003eTGT), c.38G\u003eA mutation (codon 13 GGC\u003eGAC)], which had been previously diagnosed using Scorpion-ARMS technology, in 9 colon cancer tissues (9 of 9; 100 %). Similar results were demonstrated for BRAF mutational status in 3 colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, Colo201, and HT29), which were validated by Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Subsequently, the KRAS mutation was found to be extremely rare (1 of 203; 0.5 %), and the BRAF mutation was absent (0 of 203; 0 %), in the dataset of 203 ESCCs.\nThese results suggest that KRAS and BRAF mutations play a limited role in the development of ESCC and that mutation analysis is not useful as a screening test for sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy in ESCC.","title":"KRAS and BRAF mutations in 203 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas: pyrosequencing technology and literature review.","pubmedId":"23274581"}
