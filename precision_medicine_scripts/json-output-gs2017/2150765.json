Protein serine/threonine kinase sequences were analysed using Fourier transform of the coded sequences. Characteristic code/frequency pairs were extracted from a set of well defined protein serine/threonine kinases. The characteristic frequencies 0.179, 0.250 and 0.408 distinguished protein serine/threonine kinases from proteins which did not have the biological activity. Pertinent patterns in the sequence, responsible for the code/frequency pairs detection were searched and found to be correlated with the putative catalytic domain of the proteins. Protein serine/threonine kinases involved in cell division control, CDC2 protein kinases, were compared to the other protein serine/threonine kinases. Specific code/frequency pairs were extracted from the sequences and could be related to the function or regulation of the kinases in cell division. Two CDC2 related proteins CDC2(Mm) from mice and CDC2(Gg) from chicken were shown to fit well with the CDC2 proteins, whereas KIN28, PHO85 and PSKJ3, which share sequence homology but not functional activity with the CDC2 proteins, were clearly excluded from the CDC2 proteins by the characteristic code/frequency pairs. Pertinent patterns in the CDC2 proteins were analysed and mapped on the CDC2 related protein sequences. Four patterns were correlated with the code/frequency detection and therefore, could be associated to the regulation of the CDC2-related proteins.","title":"Sequence analysis of cell cycle control (cdc2) protein kinases among protein serine/threonine kinases.","pubmedId":"2150765"}
