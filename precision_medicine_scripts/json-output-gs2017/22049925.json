We previously demonstrated that reintroduction of p16(INK4a) reversed anoikis resistance and clonogenicity of human pancreatic cancer cells, properties commonly attributed to the transforming potential of oncogenic K-Ras. Therefore, we aimed to determine the role of Ras after p16(INK4a) re-expression. Here, we show that restitution of p16(INK4a) in pancreatic cancer cell lines elicits a profound suppression of K-Ras activity. A more detailed analysis in p16(INK4a) reconstituted Capan-1 cells indicated selective reduction of both K-Ras activity and protein stability. Re-expression of K-Ras in p16(INK4a) restituted Capan-1 cells reversed the anoikis-sensitive phenotype and increased colony formation, indicating that K-Ras suppression was required for p16(INK4a) -mediated reversion of the transformed phenotype. Inducible expression of p16(INK4a) in DanG cells confirmed inhibition of K-Ras activity as well as an increase in anoikis susceptibility. Thus, our results delineate a novel functional interaction with defined biological consequences for the two most frequent alterations observed in pancreatic cancer.","title":"Tumor suppressor p16INK4a controls oncogenic K-Ras function in human pancreatic cancer cells.","pubmedId":"22049925"}
