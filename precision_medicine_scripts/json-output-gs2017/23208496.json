Using a lung cancer mouse model that expresses a cre-mediated KrasG12D mutant, we identified a critical role for the cell surface molecule CD44 in mediating cell proliferation downstream of oncogenic Kras signaling. The deletion of CD44 attenuates lung adenocarcinoma formation and prolongs the survival of these mice. Mechanistically, CD44 is required for the activation of Kras-mediated signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and thus promotes tumor cell proliferation. Together, these results reveal an unrecognized role for CD44 in oncogenic Kras-induced lung adenocarcinoma and suggest that targeting CD44 could be an effective strategy for halting Kras-dependent carcinomas.","title":"CD44 promotes Kras-dependent lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23208496"}
