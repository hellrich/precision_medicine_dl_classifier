To date, risk factors for male breast cancer are poorly defined, but certain risk factors and genetic features appear common to both male and female breast cancer. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence female breast cancer risk; 12 of these have been independently replicated. To examine if these variants contribute to male breast cancer risk, we genotyped 433 male breast cancer cases and 1,569 controls. Five SNPs showed a statistically significant association with male breast cancer: rs13387042 (2q35) (odds ratio (OR)  \u003d 1.30, p \u003d 7.98×10⁻⁴), rs10941679 (5p12) (OR \u003d 1.26, p \u003d 0.007), rs9383938 (6q25.1) (OR \u003d 1.39, p \u003d 0.004), rs2981579 (FGFR2) (OR \u003d 1.18, p \u003d 0.03), and rs3803662 (TOX3) (OR \u003d 1.48, p \u003d 4.04×10⁻⁶). Comparing the ORs for male breast cancer with the published ORs for female breast cancer, three SNPs--rs13387042 (2q35), rs3803662 (TOX3), and rs6504950 (COX11)--showed significant differences in ORs (p\u003c0.05) between sexes. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease; the relative risks associated with loci identified to date show subtype and, based on these data, gender specificity. Additional studies of well-defined patient subgroups could provide further insight into the biological basis of breast cancer development.","title":"Genetic variants at chromosomes 2q35, 5p12, 6q25.1, 10q26.13, and 16q12.1 influence the risk of breast cancer in men.","pubmedId":"21949660"}
