A minimum number of reads was consistently achieved with overall median read depth of 529Ã— per amplicon. In total, 25 point mutations and 4 insertions/deletions (indels) with a frequency of 5.5% to 93.1% mutant alleles were detected. All EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, PIK3CA, KRAS, and PTEN mutations, as detected by next-generation sequencing, were confirmed by pyrosequencing, with the exception of 3 point mutations in a tumor sample with low mutant-allele burden (below the pyrosequencing limit of detection).\nThe GS Junior-based, targeted, resequencing assay for a focused set of non-small cell lung cancer driver genes allows for quick and sensitive detection of point mutations and indels for the most relevant therapeutic genes in this type of cancer.","title":"Routine Clinical Mutation Profiling of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Next-Generation Sequencing.","pubmedId":"26125431"}
