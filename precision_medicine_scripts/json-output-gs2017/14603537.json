Behavioral scientists gathered at the Second International Conference on Cervical Cancer (Houston, TX, April 11-14, 2002) reviewed selected studies of behavioral factors related to cervical cancer, including women\u0027s receptivity to emerging cervical cancer screening and diagnostic technologies, factors that influence adherence to follow-up colposcopy recommendations, and cervical cancer survivors\u0027 quality of life. Researchers reported that reduced distress during examinations with new technology may improve adherence to cervical cancer screening recommendations. Until new technology becomes mainstream, research shows that distress is reduced and adherence improves when health care providers match interventions to patients\u0027 informational processing styles. Investigations of survivors\u0027 quality of life report conflicting findings, but studies indicate that survivors experience anger over reproductive loss, loss of interest in sex, and perhaps a greater vulnerability to sexual dysfunction compared with survivors of other cancers. Survivors also report a need for posttherapy support programs. Primary prevention of cervical cancer should remain a priority as research in behavioral interventions and barriers to screening, especially among vulnerable populations, moves forward.","title":"Cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"14603537"}
