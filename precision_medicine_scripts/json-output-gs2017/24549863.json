The aim of the present study was to clarify the relationship between PEM resistance and gene expression of EGFR and ErbB3, by establishing the PEM-resistant lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line, A549/PEM. Compared with A549 cells, the A549/PEM cells were significantly more resistant to PEM (P\u003d0.0024). The downregulation of S phase and arrest at G1 stage were detected in the A549/PEM cell line when compared to the A549 cells (P\u003c0.05). The apoptosis rate of A549/PEM cells was much lower than that of the A549 cells after a 24 h continuous exposure to PEM (P\u003c0.001). Real-time PCR and western blotting demonstrated the overexpression of EGFR and ErbB3 in A549/PEM cells. However, downregulation of EGFR or ErbB3 by lentiviral delivered shRNAs in A549/PEM cells showed no significant correlation with PEM sensitivity while silencing both EGFR and ErbB3 increased the cellular response to PEM in the A549/PEM cells and significantly decreased phosphorylation of STAT3, AKT and ERK. Together, these data suggest that either high expression of EGFR or ErbB3 plays a critical role in the cellular response to PEM in human lung adenocarcinoma cells though EGFR/ErbB3-dependent pathways.","title":"Downregulation of both EGFR and ErbB3 improves the cellular response to pemetrexed in an established pemetrexedâ€‘resistant lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line.","pubmedId":"24549863"}
