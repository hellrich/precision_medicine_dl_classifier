However, acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs is mostly driven by a second-site EGFR T790M mutation, which negates their inhibitory activity. Osimertinib (AZD9291, Tagrissoâ„¢), an oral, third-generation EGFR TKI, has been designed to target the EGFR T790M mutation, while sparing wild-type EGFR. In this up-to-date review, focus is not only on the structure, mechanisms, and pharmacokinetics of osimertinib but also on summarizing clinical trials and making recommendations of osimertinib for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
