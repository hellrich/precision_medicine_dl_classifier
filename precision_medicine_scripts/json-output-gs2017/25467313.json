Platinum-containing NCT, particularly in patients with HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) may increase pCR rates.\nTumor characteristics, pCR rates (no invasive disease in breast and lymph nodes), toxicities, and survival in patients who received carboplatin, a taxane, and trastuzumab (HER2+ disease) between April 2009 and December 2011, were reviewed.\nThirty eight patients (39 tumors) completed a median of 4 cycles of NCT. Eighteen of 39 (46%) tumors were HER2+, 8/18 (44%) responded with pCR; 13/18 HER2+ tumors were HR+ (72%) and 4/13 (31%) had a pCR. Ten of 39 (26%) tumors were TNBC; 6/10 (60%) had a pCR. At a median of 25-months no recurrences were observed in patients with pCR.\nProspective studies of anthracycline-free platinum-containing NCT are warranted in LABC patients with HER2+ and TNBC.","title":"Pathologic complete response rates in triple-negative, HER2-positive, and hormone receptor-positive breast cancers after anthracycline-free neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab.","pubmedId":"25467313"}
