In this setting, polymyositis may be treated with glucocorticoids in combination with cancer specific treatment.\nWe present the case of a 52-year-old man with stage IIA pancreatic tail adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical treatment and six months into therapy with gemcitabine he developed symmetrical, painful, proximal muscle weakness with peripheral oedema. Re-evaluation with imaging modalities, muscle histology and biochemistry conferred the diagnosis of polymyositis associated with pancreatic cancer progression. The patient was treated with glucocorticoids along with gemcitabine and erlotinib which resulted in complete remission within six months. He remained in good health for a further six months on erlotinib maintenance therapy when a new computer tomography scan showed pancreatic cancer relapse and hence prompted 2nd line chemotherapy with gemcitabine.\nPolymyositis associated with pancreatic cancer may respond to glucocorticoids along with cancer specific treatment.","title":"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma-associated polymyositis treated with corticosteroids along with cancer specific treatment: case report.","pubmedId":"21470434"}
