Recent discoveries have led to an understanding of the biological role of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-Î± in GIST and the development of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, formerly STI-571), one of the most exciting examples of targeted therapy to date. The success of targeted therapy in GIST has lead to new developments in our understanding of the medical and surgical management of the disease. Intense study of GIST may lead to new paradigms in the management of cancer.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor and its targeted therapeutics.","pubmedId":"21527063"}
