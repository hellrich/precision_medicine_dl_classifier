In most cases it presents months to years after diagnosis of primary cutaneous melanoma was made or after recurrence. We describe a 55-year-old male patient who presented with symptoms of decreased vision and photopsia. Diagnosis of melanoma-associated retinopathy was made, but no primary cutaneous melanoma was found. 3 months later he developed intestinal perforation due to small intestinal melanoma.","title":"Presumed melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR): a presenting sign of primary small intestinal melanoma?","pubmedId":"22527450"}
