Regression methods were used to identify differences between ACC and DCC and to identify predictors of survival for resected ACC. Eight hundred sixty-five patients with ACC were identified.\nMedian tumor size was 6.9 cm (vs. 4.6 cm DCC); 32.1% had nodal metastases (vs. 48.0% DCC); and 47% had high-grade tumors (vs. 37.3% DCC). Resection margins were R0 77.3%, R1 13.7%, and R2 9.0%. Patients with ACC were more likely to be male, white, and have larger tumor size, no nodal involvement, or pancreatic tail tumors. Stage-specific 5-year survival was significantly better for resected ACC vs. DCC Stage I: 52.4% vs. 28.4%, II: 40.2% vs. 9.8%, III: 22.8% vs. 6.8%, and IV: 17.2% vs. 2.8%. On multivariable analysis, age \u003c 65, well-differentiated tumors, and negative resection margins were independent prognostic factors for ACC.\nACC carries a better prognosis than DCC. Aggressive surgical resection with negative margins is associated with long-term survival in these more favorable pancreatic cancers.","title":"Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas in the United States: prognostic factors and comparison to ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18836784"}
