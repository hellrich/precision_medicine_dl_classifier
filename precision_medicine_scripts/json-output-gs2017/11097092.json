In human breast cancer, overexpression of p185 occurs in 15-30% of cases, correlates with poor prognostic factors and characterizes breast cancers with a more aggressive behavior. Overexpression of p185 is usually associated with c-erbB-2 amplification, though it may occur independently and thus define subpopulations of breast cancers which might be of clinical interest. p185 expression is usually detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and few studies have been carried out to evaluate the p185 content of breast cancers with an ELISA technique. In this context, we showed, in 106 breast cancer samples, that p185 was expressed at high levels in 13.2%, intermediate levels in 55.7% and negative ones in 31.1% of cases. All p185 positive samples showed a c-erbB-2 oncogene amplification while none of the p185 negative samples and only 4% of p185 imtermediate samples had an amplification of c-erbB-2. p185 expression is significantly correlated with the negativity of estrogen and progestrone receptors, with high levels of cathepsin D and in some conditions with axillary nodal involvement. Thus, using the p185 ELISA assay, the c-erbB-2 status of breast cancers can be defined and moreover a subset can be discriminated which is characterized by intermediate levels of p185 and absence of c-erbB-2 amplification. The quantitative approach towards p185 in breast cancers affords the possibility of identifying more appropriately patients with high or low risk and thus permits adaptation of therapeutic regimens.","title":"Relevance of p185 HER-2/neu oncoprotein quantification in human primary breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11097092"}
