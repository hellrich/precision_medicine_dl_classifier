Improvements in ablative technologies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) offer the surgeon additional alternatives in the management of selected intrahepatic tumors. We present a case report of a single intrahepatic recurrence of cholangiocarcinoma 12 months after primary resection of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma including right lobectomy for intrahepatic extension. The patient received operative treatment and RFA of the intrahepatic lesion. RFA successfully ablated the recurrent tumor, and the patient remains free of detectable disease 10 months later. A review of literature is presented. This is the first known report of the use of RFA for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In selected cases of primary or recurrent cholangiocarcinoma, RFA may increase the percentage of patients considered surgically treatable.","title":"Radiofrequency ablation of recurrent cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"11952256"}
