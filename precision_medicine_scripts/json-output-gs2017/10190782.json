The combination of radiotherapy plus standard chemotherapy (etoposide plus cisplatin) has yielded limited success; therefore, new and novel chemotherapies have been sought. Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ), the prototype of a novel class of drugs, the taxanes, has proven feasible both alone and with other agents in combined-modality regimens with radiation. Concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin/radiotherapy appears to offer a relatively safe and more active regimen to control local and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer than the current standard. This report reviews the range of experience with paclitaxel-based combined-modality therapy.","title":"Concurrent paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiation therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"10190782"}
