All members were over 20Â years of age. We explained familial breast cancer and BRCA gene testing, and obtained autonomic consent before gene testing. Genetic testing revealed twins in a family were dizygotic. In another family bilateral breast cancer occurred in a carrier after five years of genetic testing. Carriers are at high risk of breast cancer and have to receive breast cancer screening and familial tumor counseling. Non-carriers are at the same risk of breast cancer as the general population.","title":"Three cases of kindred with familial breast cancer in which carrier detection by BRCA gene testing was performed on family members.","pubmedId":"19806429"}
