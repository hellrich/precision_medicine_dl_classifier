A 69-year-old woman underwent a left hemicolectomy for sigmoid colon cancer. The tumor was staged T3N0M0. Two years after the operation, there was an elevation of CEA and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass in the spleen, considered as an isolated metastasis. The patient underwent splenectomy. Histological diagnosis confirmed a metastatic adenocarcinoma from colorectal carcinoma. Patient was alive without neoplasic recurrence 5 years after splenectomy. Generally, splenic metastasis is uncommon. However, with the case of colorectal cancers, metastasis to the spleen is particularly rare. As with splenic metastasis of all primary tumors, the literature recommends that the treatment, where possible, is surgical.","title":"Isolated splenic metastasis from colorectal cancer: report of a case.","pubmedId":"17939014"}
