The aim of the present report was to describe a case of exposure to liraglutide during the first trimester of pregnancy in a patient with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nA 37-year-old woman with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who had been taking liraglutide for 2Â years was admitted in the 13(th) week of gestation. Liraglutide was immediately discontinued and intensive insulin therapy instituted. The woman gave birth to a healthy child after completing an uneventful gestation period.\nAlthough the present normal pregnancy outcome does not mean that glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues are safe to use in pregnancy, this report contributes to the limited knowledge regarding human exposure to these drugs during pregnancy in women with diabetes.","title":"Normal pregnancy outcome after first-trimester exposure to liraglutide in a woman with Type 2 diabetes.","pubmedId":"25683470"}
