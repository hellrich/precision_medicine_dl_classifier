Eight cases were H1, 7 were H2, and 3 were H3. Hepatic lobectomy was done in 3 cases, lobectomy + partial resection in 2 cases, and partial resection in 13 cases. All cases received high-dose intermittent 5-FU infusion (WHF \u003d 5-FU 1,000 mg/m2/5 hrs/w) on an outpatient basis. The total frequency of WHF was 4-54 times (average 29), and total 5-FU doses ranged from 6.0 to 81.0 g (average 40 g). The 1- and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 100% and 77.5% in all patients 100% and 87.5% in H1 group and 100% and 64.3% in H2 + H3 group, respectively. There was no significant difference of survival between the H1 and H1 + H3 groups. The 1- and 5-year recurrence rates in residual liver were 5.9% and 14.4%, respectively. One of 2 cases with residual liver recurrence was resected for metastasis again, and the patient is now in a disease-free state. WHF after resection of hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer has a preventive effect for their survival, not only in H1 group but also in H2 + H3 group.","title":"[Intra-arterial preventive chemotherapy for residual liver after resection of hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"9703834"}
