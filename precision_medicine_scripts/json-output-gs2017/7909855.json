We examined HPV DNA typing and its gene expression, oncogenes (c-myc, EGF-R, c-erb B2) and p53 in cervical dysplasia and cancer with molecular biologic, immunohistochemical technique and binding assay to establish a gene diagnosis of uterine cervical cancer. The HPV study revealed that HPV DNA was detected at a high frequency at a higher grade of dysplasia and in the early stage of cervical cancer; especially HPV type 16 was associated with cervical carcinogenesis. In the oncogene study, c-myc gene overexpression was recognized in the advanced stage of cervical cancer. The other oncogene and p53 were found in a low frequency and were non-specific genes in cervical cancer. These findings indicated that HPV DNA diagnosis is a useful tool for screening the high risk group of cervical precancerous lesions and that oncogene detection might be useful in determining the biological behavior of a malignant tumor.","title":"[Gene diagnosis of uterine cervical cancer].","pubmedId":"7909855"}
