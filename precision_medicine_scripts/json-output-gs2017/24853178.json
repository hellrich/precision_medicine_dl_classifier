Only few data are available regarding prevalence, prognostic significance and clinico-pathological characteristics of FGFR1-amplified and early-stage non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). We therefore investigated the FGFR1 gene status in a large number of well-characterised early-stage NSCLC.\nFGFR1 gene status was evaluated using a commercially available fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) probe on a tissue microarray (TMA). This TMA harbours 329 resected, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, nodal-negative NSCLC with a UICC stage I-II. The FISH results were correlated with clinico-pathological features and overall survival (OS).\nThe prevalence of an FGFR1 amplification was 12.5% (41/329) and was significantly (P\u003c0.0001) higher in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (20.7%) than in adenocarcinoma (2.2%) and large cell carcinoma (13%). Multivariate analysis revealed significantly (P\u003d0.0367) worse 5-year OS in patients with an FGFR1-amplified NSCLC.\nFGFR1 amplification is common in early-stage SCC of the lung and is an independent and adverse prognostic marker. Its potential role as a predictive marker for targeted therapies or adjuvant treatment needs further investigation.","title":"Prognostic role of FGFR1 amplification in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24853178"}
