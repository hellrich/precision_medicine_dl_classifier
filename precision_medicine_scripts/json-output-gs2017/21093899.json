For individual SNPs, we used unconditional logistic regression models, adjusted for age and site, to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To replicate the one statistically significant association in PECS, we independently genotyped that tagSNP among 1141 endometrial cancer cases and 2275 controls from the SEARCH study in the UK. We assessed haplotypes via extended haplotype blocks and the sequential haplotype scan method.\nThe rs2677764 tagSNP in PIK3CA was statistically significantly associated with endometrial cancer in PECS (OR\u003d1.42, 95% CI, 1.03-1.95; P\u003d0.03) but not SEARCH (OR\u003d0.98, 95% CI\u003d0.82-1.17). Of the 25 haplotypes observed in at least 5% of cases and controls in PECS, only 1, in PIK3CA, was statistically significantly associated with endometrial cancer (OR\u003d1.39, 95% CI, 1.00-1.93). All haplotype global p-values were null.\nCommon genetic variation in PTEN, PIK3CA, AKT1, MLH1, or MSH2 was not statistically significantly associated with endometrial cancer.","title":"Endometrial cancer and genetic variation in PTEN, PIK3CA, AKT1, MLH1, and MSH2 within a population-based case-control study.","pubmedId":"21093899"}
