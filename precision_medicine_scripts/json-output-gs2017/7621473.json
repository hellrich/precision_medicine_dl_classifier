Androgens are crucial for the normal development of the prostate gland and in maintaining its functional state in the adult. It seems that the prolonged presence of androgens might also be an important factor in the development of prostate cancer. In addition, androgens and oestrogens appear to play a part in the development of benign prostatic hypertrophy, although the exact nature of their role has not been clearly defined. Stimulation of prostate cancer growth by androgens is well established with androgen withdrawal therapy being the most effective therapy in men with prostate cancer. Additive steroid therapy of metastatic prostate cancer with oestrogens or progestogens has also proved effective. The effects of androgens on prostate cancer cell growth might be mediated through modulation of growth factor expression and alteration of growth factor receptor levels. Androgen response can be modulated by the expression of mutated oncogenes such as ras. Androgen independence can occur through a loss of AR expression or mutation of the AR; however, the patterns of AR expression in normal prostatic tissue from development to adulthood and in cancer are now just beginning to be described. Other steroids, such as the retinoids, show promise as preventive agents, possibly through the modulation of growth factors. Vitamin D compounds modulate prostate cancer cell growth, but their role in prevention and therapy is unclear.","title":"Endocrine control of prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"7621473"}
