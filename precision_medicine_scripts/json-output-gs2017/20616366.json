KRAS mutations occur in 30-50% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) and represent a marker of clinical resistance to cetuximab therapy. In addition, the BRAF V600E is mutated in about 10% of CRCs, and the development of a specific inhibitor of mutant BRAF kinase has prompted a growing interest in BRAF (V600E) detection. Traditional methods, such as PCR and direct sequencing, do not detect low-level mutations in cancer, resulting in false negative diagnoses. In this study, we designed a protocol to detect mutations of KRAS and BRAF(V600E) in 117 sporadic CRCs based on coamplification at lower denaturation temperature PCR (COLD-PCR) and high-resolution melting (HRM). Using traditional PCR and direct sequencing, we found KRAS mutations in 47 (40%) patients and BRAF(V600E) in 10 (8.5%). The use of COLD-PCR in apparently wild-type samples allowed us to identify 15 newly mutated CRCs (10 for KRAS and 5 for BRAF (V600E)), raising the percentage of mutated CRCs to 48.7% for KRAS and to 12.8% for BRAF (V600E). Therefore, COLD-PCR combined with HRM permits the correct identification of less represented mutations in CRC and better selection of patients eligible for targeted therapies, without requiring expensive and time-consuming procedures.","title":"The use of COLD-PCR and high-resolution melting analysis improves the limit of detection of KRAS and BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"20616366"}
