The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma was higher in aged males and the sex ratio (male:female) was 1.36:1. (2) The proximal cholangiocarcinoma was most (41.6%) and distant cholangiocarcinoma was secondly (28.7%). (3) Most patients of cholangiocarcinoma were late. The resection rate was low and the rate of radical operation was 21.6% (147/680). (4) The incidence of proximal cholangiocarcinoma was higher in the positive Serologic marks for HBV and HCV and course of diseases was short. Moreover, the pathology of. positive Serologic marks for HBV and HCV trended to low-differentiation and invasion, metastasis and the resection rate was lower.\nCholangiocarcinoma is common in the aged males. The infection of HB(C)V and hilar cholangiocarcinoma are correlated and incline to the proximal bile duct. The hilar cholangiocarcinoma infected HB(C)V may have higher malignant degree in biological characteristics and more badly prognosis.","title":"[The retrospective analysis of HBV and HCV infection in cholangiocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"12895347"}
