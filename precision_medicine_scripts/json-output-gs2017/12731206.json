Ultrasound investigation and CT-scan suspicioned a malignant omental tumor. Intraoperator, we found a tumor with macroscopic malignant features (sarcomatous like), greow in omentum; the large border of the stomach being fixed but not invaded by it; the dorsal parietal peritoneum of the right lumba and the little omentum were involved, too. We removed all of the sarcomatous tumor, large omentum, small omentum and the gastric fixed segment. Also, the parietal dorsal peritoneum with metastasis, was surgically removed. The patient\u0027s postoperator evolution was very good. The histological report established the diagnostic: \"dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the omentum\". We considered the case to be interesting because of the difficulties in diagnostic and the rarity of it.","title":"[Dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the omentum].","pubmedId":"12731206"}
