The prognosis and cure rate of DCC is improved over that of PDA, but it remains a highly lethal disease. Although the diagnostic and therapeutic management of DCC is not dissimilar from PDA, the pathophysiology is, in many instances, distinctly different. A multi-disciplinary approach toward DCC is important. ","title":"Distal cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24679424"}
