Here we determined the expression and function of proteins involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling in benign, atypical, and malignant meningiomas and studied their association with clinicopathologic data including meningioma recurrence.\nExpression of various MAPK and PI3K signaling proteins was determined in 70 primary meningiomas and, if present, in recurrent tumors by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The expression patterns in primary and recurrent tumors were related to clinical data. The effect of MAPK and PI3K pathway inhibition on cell proliferation and apoptosis was determined using a primary malignant meningioma cell culture.\nAtypical and malignant meningiomas showed higher levels of phospho-Akt compared with benign tumors, and their proliferation could be inhibited by PI3K blocking using wortmannin. PI3K inhibition did not induce apoptosis in malignant meningioma cells. In contrast, expression of phospho-Raf and phospho-MAPK was decreased in aggressive meningiomas compared with benign tumors, but MAPK inhibition by PD98059 resulted in tumor cell apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Reduced MAPK activation was associated with meningioma recurrence, and PI3K activation was associated with poor preclinical condition and brain invasion of malignant meningiomas.\nBoth MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways are activated at different levels in benign and malignant meningiomas. Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling contributes to the aggressive behavior of malignant meningiomas, whereas MAPK activation is involved in both proliferation and apoptosis of malignant meningiomas.","title":"Different activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt signaling is associated with aggressive phenotype of human meningiomas.","pubmedId":"15930342"}
