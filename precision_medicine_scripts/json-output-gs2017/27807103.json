{"organisms":["6755"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Three studies on prostate cancer indicate, respectively, that a hypofractionated schedule of intensity-modulated radiation therapy reduces treatment time without negatively affecting quality of life; treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy is a powerful, potentially more cost-effective option; and prostate brachytherapy, without external radiation, may be sufficient to control disease progression. The data were presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology\u0027s 2016 annual meeting.","title":"Radiation Therapy Advances for Prostate Cancer.","pubmedId":"27807103"}
