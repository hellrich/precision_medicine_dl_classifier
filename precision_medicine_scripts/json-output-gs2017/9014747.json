The mean EGFR level in tumours was 30.38 fmol/mg (+/-41.95 S.D.) of membrane protein (mg.p), significantly higher (P \u003d 0.00016) than in normal tissues (mean, 10.26 +/- 10.02 fmol/mg.p). The mean EGFR concentration was also significantly higher in pathological stage IV tissue than in stages I (P \u003d 0.049) and II (P \u003d 0.040), and the mean EGFR concentration was significantly higher in cases with mediastinal involvement than in cases without it (P \u003d 0.029). The mean EGFR level was higher in DNA aneuploid and multiploid cases than in DNA diploid cases, but there was no significant difference. No significant relationships were found to exist between receptor concentrations and pathological tumour size or histological type, or patient gender or age. From the above findings, a possible prognostic role for EGFR in primary NSCLC should be investigated.","title":"A comparison of epidermal growth factor receptor levels and other prognostic parameters in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"9014747"}
