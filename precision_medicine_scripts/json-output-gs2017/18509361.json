A cohort of 57 primary cutaneous T1-2 melanoma tumors was analyzed. Mutation frequency for both genes was 61% (NRAS 26% and BRAF 39%). In a univariate analysis, shorter overall survival was associated with the presence of ulceration (P\u003d0.001) and BRAF exon 15 mutations (P\u003d0.005) as well as the absence of nuclear activation of Akt (P\u003d0.022) and of cytoplasmic activation of ERK (P\u003d0.003). Unexpectedly, ulceration was a significant adverse prognostic factor only in melanomas with BRAF mutations, whereas there was no effect of ulceration on overall survival in tumors with wild-type BRAF. A multivariate analysis showed that significant independent adverse survival prognostic markers were absence of cytoplasmic activation of ERK (P\u003d0.007) and ulceration (P\u003d0.008), whereas BRAF exon 15 mutation status showed a nonsignificant trend (P\u003d0.066). The absence of cytoplasmic ERK activation in poor prognosis T1-2 melanomas may be associated with activation of some other uncharacterized pathway leading to tumor progression and adverse outcome. Immunohistochemical analysis of cytoplasmic phosphorylated ERK could be used as a prognostic marker in primary melanomas if confirmed in another data set.","title":"Lack of cytoplasmic ERK activation is an independent adverse prognostic factor in primary cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"18509361"}
