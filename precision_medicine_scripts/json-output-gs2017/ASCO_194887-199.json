The goal of this study was to better understand the KRAS patients with co-occurring mutations. Methods: We identified 60 patients with a diagnosis of NSCLC and a KRAS mutation in the COH Cancer Registry from 2009 to 2016. Next generation sequencing was performed. Results: Of the 60 patients identified, 42 (70%) were Stage IV at diagnosis, 7 (12%) Stage I and 7 (12%) stage II and 4 (6%) Stage III. 47 (78) patients were smokers. Caucasian was the most common (n \u003d 44, 73%) racial group, followed by Asians (n \u003d 9, 15%), African-Americans (n \u003d 3, 5%), other (n \u003d 3, 5%) and Pacific Islander (n \u003d 1, 1.7%). The average age at diagnosis was 67 (median 69.50) years; 30 patients (50%) were over 70 years, 23 (38%) patients were 51-69 years, and 7 (12%) 50 years or below. Majority of the patients had metastatic disease (n \u003d 52, 87%) with 20% (n \u003d 12) having brain metastasis with average metastatic sites 1.6. An average of 1.97 (range \u003d 0-5) lines of therapy including chemotherapy, biologic agents or immunotherapy were received. 12 (20%) patients received immunotherapy, radiation in 28 (47%) and surgery in 22 (37%) with a median overall survival at 15 months. The most frequent molecular alteration was codon 12 mutation (n \u003d 47, 78%), followed by codon 13 (n \u003d 7, 12%) and codon 61 (n \u003d 6, 10%) mutations. The most common co-occurring mutations in this cohort were TP53 (n \u003d 15, 25%), ATM (n \u003d 9, 15%), LRP1B (n \u003d 9, 15%), ARID1A (n \u003d 8, 13%), STK11 (n \u003d 8, 13%), ARID1B (n \u003d 7, 12%), TERT (n \u003d 7, 12%), EGFR (n \u003d 6, 10%), RBM10 (n \u003d 6, 10%), SPTA1 (n \u003d 6, 10%). We are currently evaluating the relevance of the Circos plot analysis for these mutations, clinical response to immunotherapy and potential biomarkers. Conclusions: KRAS mutations are among the most common molecular alterations identified in NSCLC. Effective treatments targeting KRAS mutations have represented a challenge so far. Understanding the significance of co-mutations and their therapeutic implications, especially in response to immunotherapy and other agents represents an important step to develop better treatment options for KRAS mutated lung cancers.","title":"KRAS in non-small cell lung cancer: Single institution experienceWhat factors are involved?","pubmedId":"ASCO_194887-199"}
