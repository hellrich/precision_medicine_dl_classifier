To our knowledge, Sweet\u0027s syndrome has been reported in cervical cancer in only three other patients.\nWe report a case of a 44-year-old female diagnosed with cervical cancer (FIGO IIIB), treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Approximately 5 months after completing treatment, she presented with nausea, vomiting, and bullous pustular lesions on the hand. She was found to have a small bowel obstruction due to recurrence of her cervical cancer, and a biopsy of the skin lesion showed a marked dermal neutrophilic infiltrate consistent with Sweet\u0027s syndrome.\nWe report a case of Sweet\u0027s syndrome associated with cervical cancer, which is a rare finding.","title":"A rare association of Sweet\u0027s syndrome with cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"15491764"}
