This study is aimed to demonstrate the impact of diabetes on clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer. Clinical and epidemiological information was collected from medical records or by personal interview in 1328 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Diabetes was defined by a known medical history, or abnormal fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c levels within three months of the cancer diagnosis. Duration of â‰¤3 years was used as the cutoff to arbitrarily define the new-onset and long-term diabetes. Logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test and Cox regression models were employed in the data analysis. Elevated level of FBG or HbA1c was observed in 24.7% and 11.5% of the patients without a known diabetes history, respectively. The prevalence of DM was 44.4% and was comparable by strata of tumor stage. New-onset diabetes was a significant independent predictor for risk of death in metastatic patients (HR\u003d1.35, 95% CI\u003d1.11-1.63, P\u003d0.002) and in all patients (HR\u003d1.23, 95% CI\u003d1.09-1.40, P\u003d0.001). Both new-onset and long term diabetes were significantly associated with older age, obesity, hypertension and coronary artery disease as well as weight loss. New-onset diabetes was also significantly related to larger tumors and elevated level of CA19-9 but not to tumor site and presence of biliary obstruction. Diabetes in general and new-onset diabetes in particular, is associated with poor outcome of pancreatic cancer. New-onset and long-term diabetes share common risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
