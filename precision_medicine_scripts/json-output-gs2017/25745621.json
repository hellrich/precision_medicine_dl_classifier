BRAF and ERK1/2 play important roles in the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways. The present study investigated the clinicopathologic outcomes of BRAF mutation and ERK1/2 expression in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and the possibility of using them as prognostic indicators.\nDual-priming oligonucleotide-based multiplex polymerase chain reaction for BRAF (V600E) mutation and immunohistochemical analysis of ERK1/2 were performed using 65 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples from patients with CRC. We analyzed the dependences of the clinicopathologic features on BRAF mutation and ERK1/2 expression.\nOut of 65 samples from CRC patients, BRAF mutation was detected in 3 (4.6%). The 3 patients with BRAF mutation presented with T3 CRC with lymph node metastasis (stage III) showing moderately or poorly differentiated histology. ERK1 and ERK2 were positively detected in 73.8% and 15.4% of the patients with CRC, respectively. ERK1 expression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.049). ERK2 expression was significantly correlated with tumor emboli (P \u003c 0.05), tumor invasion (P \u003d 0.035), lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.017), and stage (P \u003d 0.02).\nBRAF mutation and ERK1/2 expression may be associated with advanced or more aggressive CRC. These molecular markers might play prognostic roles in CRC developed through the serrated pathway.","title":"Clinicopathologic Significance of BRAF Mutation and Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase 1/2 Expression in Patients With a Colorectal Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25745621"}
