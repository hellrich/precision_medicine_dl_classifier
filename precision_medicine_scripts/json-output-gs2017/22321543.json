The genomic DNA was extracted. Mutations of EGFR gene (exons 19 and 21) were detected by real-time PCR.\nDNA was available in 1410 cases. Somatic mutations of the EGFR gene were identified in 401 cases (27.8%). Among patients with EGFR mutations, 41.4% (n\u003d166) had del E746-A750 of exon19, 6.7% (n\u003d27) had del L747-P753insS of exon 19, 50.3% (n\u003d201) had L858R of exon 21, and 1.5% (n\u003d6) had L861Q of exon 21. Woman, non-smoker and adenocarcinoma showed a higher percentage of EGFR mutation (43.2%, 37.6%, and 33.5%, respectively). However, there was no association among age, grades, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stages (P\u003e0.05). The mutation rate of BAC subtype (61.3%, 19/31) and adenocarcinoma with BAC features (48.0%, 12/25) was significantly higher than that of conventional adenocarcinoma (32.4%, 336/1038). A further assess of the smoking status found a trend that the more increased smoking exposure, the lower the incidence of EGFR mutations. A multivariable analysis revealed that adenocarcinoma, never smoking, and female were independently associated with EGFR mutations (odds rations\u003d3.381, 2.393, and 1.727, respectively).\nThe detection rate of EGFR mutation is higher in Chinese patients, especially in non-smoking female patients with adenocarcinoma. Real-time PCR is a sensitive and accurate method to detect the mutations of EGFR gene and can therefore provide useful information for clinical treatment.","title":"[Relationship between mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor gene and clinicopathologic features of non-small cell lung cancers].","pubmedId":"22321543"}
