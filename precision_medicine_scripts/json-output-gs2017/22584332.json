Meanwhile, caution is required because there is a possibility of drug-induced lung injury and death due to high frequency, compared with the appearance rate described in the packaging insertion. We investigated the clinical background of a patient in whom drug-induced lung injury appeared, and clarified the risk factor by administering gemcitabine hydrochloride. Males, people aged 65 or over, those with a smoking history and those undergoing first-line chemotherapy treatment are at risk of drug-induced lung injury. Attention must be paid to the occurrence of drug-induced lung injury, to examining the clinical course, the chest image, and the blood test, and to do earlier detection, the offending medicine discontinuance, and beginning of the treatment.","title":"[Analysis of risk factors of drug-induced lung injury in patients receiving gemcitabine treatment].","pubmedId":"22584332"}
