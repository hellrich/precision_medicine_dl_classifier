Nevertheless, 5% of tumors with clinicopathologic features of GIST lack KIT expression (KIT-negative GIST). A precise diagnosis of GIST is crucial due to the therapeutic efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our goal was to characterize mutational status of tyrosine kinase receptors (KIT and PDGFRA) and to evaluate the value of PKC as a diagnostic marker in KIT-negative GISTs. Methods: KIT-negative GISTs (n\u003d22) were analyzed in a retrospective manner. As controls, we included KIT-positive GISTs (n\u003d46), mesenchymal non-GIST tumors (n\u003d28) and KIT-positive non-GIST tumors (n\u003d32). PKC and diagnostic markers including CD34, S-100 and desmin were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray. The 2 test was used to compare the presence of PKC among the tumors included. Further, PDGFRA gene (exons 12, 14, 18) and KIT gene (exons 9, 11) were examined in KIT-negative GISTs (n\u003d14) by sequencing. Results: PKC expression was detected in 63.6% (14/22) of KIT-negative GISTs and this was significantly higher than the frequency of non-GIST tumors (23.3%; 14/60) (p\u003d0.001). PKC was detected in 83.7% of KIT-positive GISTs. We found no significant difference between expression rates for PKC in KIT-negative and KIT positive GISTs (p\u003d0.069). However, expression rates for PKC was higher among all GISTs, regardless KIT expression, when compared to non-GISTs tumors (p\u003c0.001). In addition, among KIT-negative GISTs, CD34 was detected in 59.1% and desmin in 13.6%. None expressed S-100. PDGFRA mutations were found in 5/14 (35.7%) (exon 18, 33.3%; exon 12, 33.3%; exon 14, 16.7%). KIT mutation was found in 1/14 (16.7%; exon 9) tumors analyzed. Conclusions: In contrast to previous reports, there was no predominance of PDGFRA exon 18 mutations in our KIT-negative GISTs. Further, mutation frequency was lower in these tumors than those reported for KIT-positive GISTs. The diagnostic and pathogenic relevance of both PDGFRA and KIT mutations should be better explored. In this study, PKC could differentiate GIST, regardless KIT expression, from non-GIST tumors and emerged as a potential diagnostic biomarker for KIT-negative GISTs.","title":"Protein kinase C  (PKC) expression as a potential diagnostic marker for KIT-negative GIST.","pubmedId":"ASCO_34047-65"}
