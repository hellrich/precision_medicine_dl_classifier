To verify this finding, RFLP analysis was performed with two polymorphic probes, MOX2 and D3S5. The patient was informative for both single copy probes and demonstrated loss of heterozygosity in the region above whereas chromosome 22 displayed no loss of heterozygosity as judged by a proximal and a distal probe.","title":"Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 3, bands q24----qter, in a diploid meningioma.","pubmedId":"1680607"}
