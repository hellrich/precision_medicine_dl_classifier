The postoperative morbidity was 39% (21 of 54 patients). The indications for the operation were malignant tumour (n \u003d 41), mainly ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (n \u003d 30), benign tumour (n \u003d 5) or inflammatory head of the pancreas tumour in chronic pancreatitis (n \u003d 6). A classical Whipple\u0027s operation was performed in 36 patients, while the stomach-preserving variant was undertaken in 18. The main complications were postoperative disorders of gastric emptying (n \u003d 13), bleeding (n \u003d 7), abscess (n \u003d 4), leakage at the pancreas anastomosis (n \u003d 3) and pancreatic fistula (n \u003d 2). All complications were successfully overcome by early use of interventional methods or relaparotomy. -The low mortality rate of Whipple\u0027s operation (0-5% in selected centres) justifies the use of this operation even in advanced malignancies.","title":"[54 consecutive duodenopancreatectomies without fatality].","pubmedId":"7908868"}
