Recent evidence of metabolic alterations has indicated that the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway is used as a carbon source for anabolic processes in some tumors, thus making this pathway a potential target for therapy. The carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT; EC 2.3.1.21) enzyme transfers long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix for Î²-oxidation. Because carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1a (CPT1a) is the rate-limiting enzyme for FAO, the authors evaluated the effects of CPT1A knock-down in BRAF V600E melanoma cell lines. The results showed that knock-down of CPT1A inhibited FAO and that CPT1A is critical for malignant V600E melanoma cells, particularly BRAF V600E melanoma cells. The proliferation and tumorigenesis in V600E melanoma were decrease after CPT1A knockdown. These results suggest that therapy for BRAF V600E melanoma can include targeting metabolic alterations. CPT1A is more important for lipid synthesis in V600E mutant melanoma cells than in wild-type BRAF melanoma cells.","title":"Targeting CPT1A enhances metabolic therapy in human melanoma cells with the BRAF V600E mutation.","pubmedId":"27793752"}
