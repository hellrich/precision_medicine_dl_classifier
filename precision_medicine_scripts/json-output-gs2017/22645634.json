Forty one patients with LM were analyzed for the time of metastasis, prognostic factors affecting LM, and survival.\nLM was found in 40.6%. The median time of the LM (n \u003d 41) was 6.0 Â± 4.6 mo and most LM occurred within 1 year. In univariate analysis, tumor size, preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and perineural invasion were factors affecting LM after resection. In multivariate analysis, tumor size was the most important factor for LM. In univariate analysis, tumor cell differentiation was significant to LM in low-risk groups.\nLM after resection of PDAC occurs early and shows poor survival. Tumor size is the key indicator for LM after resection.","title":"Analysis of liver metastasis after resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22645634"}
