Associations between these two conditions is currently the subject of discussion. Even a small, real increase in lung cancer risk associated with diabetes would represent a significant problem for Public Health. Methods: A meta-analysis on lung cancer risk in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic subjects was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were computed with tests for heterogeneity and publication bias. Results: There was no increased risk of lung cancer among diabetic patients (SRR \u003d 1.06; 95% CI 0.98, 1.14) based on 34 studies. The risk remained non-significant in studies adjusting for smoking (SRR \u003d 0.98; 95% CI 0.90, 1.07) and among studies not adjusting for smoking (SRR \u003d 1.09; 95% CI 0.98, 1.21). There was no significantly increased risk of lung cancer among diabetic patients in studies conducted in North America (SRR \u003d 1.04), Europe (SRR \u003d 1.01) or Asia (SRR \u003d 1.10). 22 studies investigated the association between diabetes treatments and lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer was increased among patients with diabetes treated with any type of insulin (SRR \u003d 1.20; 95% CI 1.03, 1.41) and remained unchanged when the analysis was restricted to observational studies (SRR \u003d 1.20; 95% 1.01, 1.43). The risk of lung cancer among glargine users, the focus of the majority of studies, was not increased (SRR \u003d 1.04; 95% CI 0.91, 1.19) and this persisted when restricted to observational studies (SRR \u003d 1.02; 95% CI 0.88, 1.18). Risk of lung cancer among patients prescribed non-glargine insulin had an increased risk of lung cancer (SRR \u003d 1.50; 95% CI 1.10, 2.04). Risk of lung cancer was reduced among users of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) (SRR \u003d 0.67; 95% CI 0.54, 0.85) but not metformin (SRR \u003d 0.94; 95% CI 0.73, 1.22). Conclusions: The risk of lung cancer is not increased among patients with diabetes compared to non-diabetic subjects. Those diabetic patients prescribed glargine do not have an increased risk of lung cancer although users of other insulins have a significantly increased risk. Users of TZDs have a decreased risk of lung cancer while there is no significant protection conferred by using metformin.","title":"Lung cancer risk, diabetes, and diabetes treatments.","pubmedId":"ASCO_169591-176"}
