Follow-up data were obtained for 9494 women (87.6% of women eligible for follow-up). To investigate the effect of ERT on invasive breast carcinoma risk, the analysis was restricted to women with premenopausal breast disease whose follow-up extended through menopause and who did not develop premenopausal breast carcinoma. Relative risks were calculated with respect to women who took ERT but whose benign breast biopsies had neither atypical hyperplasia (AH), complex fibroadenoma (CFA), nor proliferative disease without atypia (PDWA).\nDuring 190,845 woman-years of follow-up there were 444 confirmed cases of invasive breast carcinoma in the entire cohort. Women with a history of AH had relative risks of invasive breast carcinoma of 2.87 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.3-6.3) and 2.53 (95% CI, 1.0-6.3) if they did or did not take ERT, respectively. For women with a history of CFA these risks were 1.57 (95% CI, 0.72-3.4) and 1.46 (95% CI, 0.53-4.0), respectively, whereas for women with a history of PDWA they were 1.37 (95% CI, 0.88-2.1) and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.69-1.9), respectively.\nERT does not significantly elevate the risk of invasive breast carcinoma in women with previous histologically defined benign breast disease. Therefore, ERT is not contraindicated in these women.","title":"Estrogen replacement therapy in women with a history of proliferative breast disease.","pubmedId":"10189132"}
