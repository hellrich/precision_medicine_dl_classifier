Angiography indicated liver involvement in 54/60 cases. The hepatic metastases were typically multiple, hypervascular, small foci (only 13 foci measured \u003e/\u003d10 mm). With one exception significant disease progression was not observed over 5 years of follow-up.\nLiver angiography is a powerful tool to reveal hepatic metastases in MTC patients. Frequent, inoperable liver metastases in hypercalcitoninemic MTC patients demonstrate that secondary lymph node dissection is an inefficient technique for restoration of a normal calcitonin level.","title":"Angiography-proven liver metastases explain low efficacy of lymph node dissections in medullary thyroid cancer patients.","pubmedId":"15698736"}
