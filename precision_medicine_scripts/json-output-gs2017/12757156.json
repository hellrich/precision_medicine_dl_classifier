PAP mRNA is also expressed in cancer cells, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, the clinicopathological significance of PAP in human pancreatic cancer is not clear. We examined PAP expression in pancreatic tissues from individuals with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using immunohistochemistry. PAP was overexpressed in 79% (30 of 38) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 19% (7 of 36) of chronic pancreatitis, and 29% (2 of 7) of mucinous cystadenoma. PAP was found in malignant ductular structures in pancreatic carcinomas as well as in benign proliferating ductules and acinar cells in chronic pancreatitis. It was not expressed in normal pancreas. The incidence of PAP overexpression was significantly higher in pancreatic cancer than in the other pancreatic diseases (P \u003c 0.01). PAP overexpression was significantly correlated with nodal involvement, distant metastasis (P \u003c 0.05), and short survival (P \u003c 0.01) in pancreatic cancer. These results suggest that overexpression of PAP in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma indicates tumor aggressiveness.","title":"Overexpression of pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"12757156"}
