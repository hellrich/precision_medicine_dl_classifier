While a partial or subtotal colectomy is indicated for early stage disease, there is a paucity of data addressing locally advanced disease involving the foregut.\nWe report two patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer presenting with locally advanced colon cancer surgically managed by pancreaticoduodenectomy with en bloc partial colectomy and a review of the literature.\nLocally advanced colorectal cancer in HNPCC is a rare clinical entity that requires special surgical consideration. Multidisciplinary treatment, including multi-visceral resection, offers the best long-term outcome.","title":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy for locally advanced colon cancer in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"26769110"}
