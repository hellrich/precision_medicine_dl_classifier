It has been traditionally used in patients not considered candidates for standard surgical resection. However, its role has been changing rapidly since the introduction of new and advanced technology, especially in tumor tracking, image guidance, and radiation delivery. Stereotactic radiation therapy is one such advancement that has shown excellent local control rates and promising survival in early stage lung cancer. In addition, the toxicity profiles are quite favorable. In addition to stereotactic radiation, advances in brachytherapy techniques have enabled high local control rates in operable patients who receive sublobar resections due to compromised pulmonary function. Isotopes that have been used include iodine-125, palladium-103, and cesium-131. In this review article, the role of radiation therapy in treatment of lung cancer, patient selection, outcomes, toxicity and recent technological advancements are discussed. The radiation therapy techniques described in this article are also being used in the management of locally advanced lung cancers.
