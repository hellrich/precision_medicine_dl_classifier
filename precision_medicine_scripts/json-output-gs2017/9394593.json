She presented severe congestive heart failure and preoperative cardiac catheterization showed massive left to right shunt (87%), mild mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The operative procedure consisted of annuloplasty of mitral valve (Kay\u0027s method), patch closure of the ostium primum defect and annuloplasty of tricuspid valve. Postoperative examination showed complete competence of mitral valve and improved functional capacity. This is the fourth successful case report of surgical correction of incomplete endocardial cushion defect in patients older than 65-year-old in Japan to our knowledge. Surgical correction of incomplete endocardial cushion defect should be recommended even in elder patients.","title":"[Successful surgical correction of incomplete endocardial cushion defect in a 65-year-old female].","pubmedId":"9394593"}
