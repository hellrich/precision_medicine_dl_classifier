The aim of this study was to investigate the evidence of the role of adjuvant GEM therapy on survival in resected pancreatic cancer. Four phase III randomized trials of adjuvant GEM in patients with resected pancreatic cancer were identified and the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival were used in this meta-analysis; 2 studies compared GEM treatment with best supportive care and 2 studies with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid therapy. The pooled data (n\u003d2017 patients) indicated that the overall survival data were homogenous among the studies (Q\u003d4.371; I\u003d31.37%; P\u003d0. 224). The combined HR significantly favors GEM over the other treatments. The overall HR was 0.88 (range, 0. 720 to 0.940; P\u003d0.014). The results indicate that GEM prolongs overall survival compared with other treatments after the resection of pancreatic cancer.
