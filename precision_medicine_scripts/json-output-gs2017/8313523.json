In the present paper we demonstrate for the N-ras gene of the rat that processed pseudogenes do interfere with this method. A first indication for this interference came from the sequence analysis of cloned PCR fragments of exon 1, amplified with primers derived from previously reported exon sequences of the mouse N-ras gene. Between different clones originating from one PCR reaction, a marked sequence heterogeneity is observed and this is shown to be the result of the presence of at least two different processed pseudogenes of the rat N-ras gene. These two pseudogenes, together with the wildtype N-ras gene and a small 3\u0027 part of the unr gene, were eventually cloned and their genomic organization and nucleotide sequences determined. Furthermore, representative examples of the confounding effects of these pseudogenes on the screening for activating point mutations are presented. Taken together, our results demonstrate that intron-specific amplification is a prerequisite for the unambiguous detection of activating point mutations in the N-ras gene of the rat.","title":"The rat N-ras gene; interference of pseudogenes with the detection of activating point mutations.","pubmedId":"8313523"}
