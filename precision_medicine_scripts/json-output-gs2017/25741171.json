The tumor was microscopically composed of spindle cells and epithelioid cells, and immunohistochemistry results showed positive staining for CD117 and CD34 expression. A genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous point mutation and deletion in exon 11 of c-KIT. After an R0 resection, imatinib mesylate was administered for 1 year until its use was discontinued due to severe side effects. Two years after the original operation, the tumor recurred in the residual liver and was completely resected again. Imatinib mesylate was administered for 2 years until it was replaced by sunitinib malate because of disease progression. The patient has survived for 53 mo after undergoing a sequential therapy consisting of surgical excision, imatinib and sunitinib.
