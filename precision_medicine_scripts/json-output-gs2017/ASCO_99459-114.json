An activating mutation of the BRAF serine/threonine protein kinase, BRAF V600E occurs in a proportion of malignant melanomas, and colorectal, thyroid, and other cancers. In hairy-cell leukemia (HCL), BRAF V600E is nearly always present, suggesting oncogene dependence. Methods: Here, we present a patient with HCL who was refractory to three lines of purine analogue-based treatment. The BRAF V600E mutation was demonstrated. After intensive counseling, the patient and his family provided written consent for vemurafenib (mutant BRAF-specific inhibitor) treatment. Results: Before vemurafenib treatment, the patient had subtotal bone marrow infiltration and massive splenomegaly (24.8 x 8.3 cm) leading to severe cytopenia (leukocytes 680/l, hemoglobin 10.0 g/dl, platelets 36.000/l). Treatment with vemurafenib was started with 240 mg twice daily and was slowly escalated to 1920 mg/d.  Within two days of treatment, the spleen softened and decreased in size. Serum CD25 (sCD25) level fell rapidly from 24.800 U/ml to normal levels (\u003c900), and platelets, hemoglobin, and leukocyte counts rose. After 16 days of vemurafenib treatment, the spleen size had shrunk to 14 x 5 cm. By day 28 of treatment (on 720 mg/d), platelet counts and sCD25 levels had normalized. Bone marrow infiltration by HCL had decreased from 70% to 20% on day 16 and complete remission was achieved on day 35. We terminated treatment on day 57 when there was no evidence of any circulating hairy cells by immunophenotyping. Conclusions: The striking therapeutic activity of vemurafenib in our patient provides the first in vivo evidence to substantiate the BRAF V600E allele as a driver and validates mutant BRAF as a therapeutic target in HCL. Proof of principle for a molecularly targeted therapy of HCL adds to the recent success of targeting oncogenic kinases in oncogene addicted malignancies. Given the rarity of HCL, introducing new therapeutic modalities may be challenging. Future studies are needed that compare short-term inhibition of BRAF with low doses of vemurafenib (or alternative BRAF inhibitors) and standard therapy.","title":"Sensitivity of refractory hairy cell leukemia to BRAF inhibition.","pubmedId":"ASCO_99459-114"}
