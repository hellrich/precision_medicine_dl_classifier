However, substantial toxicity with this combination has also been observed. This review was conducted to determine whether Gem/RT could be safely delivered in the neoadjuvant setting, based on our experience with this combined therapy in a cohort of patients with previously unresectable pancreatic cancer, who subsequently underwent surgical resection. Between July 1996 and June 2001, a total of 67 patients with locally unresectable pancreatic cancer, without distant metastatic disease, received Gem/RT at our institution. Seventeen patients (25%) underwent exploratory surgery following Gem/RT, and nine underwent standard Whipple resection. Thus 9 (52%) of 17 patients who had exploratory operations or 9 (13%) of 67 patients, underwent surgical resection. Thirty-day mortality after resection was 0%, and there were no major surgical complications. Median length of hospital stay was 14 days (range 11 to 19 days). With a median follow-up of 32 months, median survival for the resected patients was 17.6 months (95% confidence interval 12.6 to 37.3 months). Median survival for the remaining 58 patients was 11.9 months (95% confidence interval 9.6 to 14.7 months, P\u003d0.013). We conclude that surgical resection may be safely performed after Gem/RT in a select group of patients initially considered to have unresectable pancreatic cancer. The use of Gem/RT in a neoadjuvant setting is currently being investigated in a multi-institutional phase II trial.","title":"Surgical resection following radiation therapy with concurrent gemcitabine in patients with previously unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"13129554"}
