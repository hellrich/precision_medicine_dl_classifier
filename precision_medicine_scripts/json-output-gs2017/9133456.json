Three different mutations, resulting in truncation of the BRCA2 protein, were detected in 3 different families. They were 9474insA (exon 24, termination at codon 3110), C8729A (exon 20, S2834 ter) and 982del4 (exon 9, termination at codon 275). The 982del4 mutation was detected in the family with a case of male breast cancer. Age at onset was young, with a range of 28-43 years, in the 2 female breast cancer families with truncation mutations. One probable missense mutation, A10462G (13412V), was further detected in 2 families, although cosegregation of this allele with the breast cancer phenotype was not complete. The rate of BRCA2 mutations in Japanese families was suggested to be almost the same as in Western countries, and larger than it is the case for BRCA1.","title":"BRCA2 germline mutations in Japanese breast cancer families.","pubmedId":"9133456"}
