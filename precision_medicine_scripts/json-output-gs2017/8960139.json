Little, however, is known about the involvement of c-myc in the progression of colorectal cancer. We therefore determined c-myc gene expression and amplification in a group of primary tumors and metastases from patients with colorectal cancer using quantitative PCR-based tests. While the percentage of metastases overexpressing c-myc (13/26 \u003d 50%) was in the same range as reported for primary tumors by others, gene amplification of c-myc was significantly (p \u003d 0.001) more frequent in metastases (16/27 \u003d 59%) compared to primary tumors (1/23 \u003d 4%) in our series. Interestingly, in 23 metastases where both expression and amplification of c-myc could be determined, there was no correlation between gene copy number and expression level (p \u003d 0.18; r \u003d 0.19). We conclude that amplification but not overexpression of c-myc is related to metastatic progression of colorectal cancer and that overexpression of c-myc is driven by mechanisms other than the number of c-myc copies in the tumors studied.","title":"Overexpression and amplification of c-myc during progression of human colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"8960139"}
