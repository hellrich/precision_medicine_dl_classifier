Among many functions, PTEN negatively regulates the cytoplasmic phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT anti-apoptotic pathway; and nuclear PTEN affects the cell cycle by also negatively regulating the MAPK pathway via cyclin D. Decreased PTEN expression is correlated with prostate cancer progression. Over-expression of AR and upregulation of AR transcriptional activity are often observed in the later stages of prostate cancer. Recent studies indicate that PTEN regulates AR activity and stability. However, the mechanism of how AR regulates PTEN has never been studied. Furthermore, resveratrol, a phytoalexin enriched in red grapes, strawberries and peanuts, has been shown to inhibit AR transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells. In this study, we use prostate cancer cell lines to test the hypothesis that resveratrol inhibits cellular proliferation in both AR-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We show that resveratrol inhibits AR transcriptional activity in both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells. Additionally, resveratrol stimulates PTEN expression through AR inhibition. In contrast, resveratrol directly binds epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) rapidly inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation, resulting in decreased AKT phosphorylation, in an AR-independent manner. Thus, resveratrol may act as potential adjunctive treatment for late-stage hormone refractory prostate cancer. More importantly, for the first time, our study demonstrates the mechanism by which AR regulates PTEN expression at the transcription level, indicating the direct link between a nuclear receptor and the PI3K/AKT pathway.","title":"Resveratrol regulates the PTEN/AKT pathway through androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms in prostate cancer cell lines.","pubmedId":"20729295"}
