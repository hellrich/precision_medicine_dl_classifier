There is a growing body of evidence showing that cooperation between them contributes to a more aggressive tumor phenotype and impacts on their response to targeted therapy. We explored immunohistochemical co-expression of HER family receptors (HER1, HER2, HER3, HER4) and its potential role as prognostic factor in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Expression of HER family receptors was assessed by immunohistochemistry on 125 surgically resected NSCLC. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and time to recurrence were calculated for clinical variables and HER expression, using the Cox model for multivariate analysis. HER1 and HER3 expression was detected more frequently in squamous cell carcinoma (p \u003d 0.002 and p \u003d \u003c0.001, respectively). HER4 was more often expressed in patients older than 60 years (p \u003d 0.02) and in tumors of low histological grade (p \u003d 0.04). Cases which expressed only HER1 had a worse DFS (p \u003d 0.01) and OS (p \u003d 0.01) compared to cases expressing HER1 and one or more of the other family members and to cases which did not express HER1 but one of the other HERs. By multivariate analysis, stage was an independent prognostic factor for DFS and OS. Furthermore, different patterns of co-expression of HER family receptors showed a statistically significant correlation with a shorter DFS (p \u003d 0.03) and OS (p \u003d 0.02). Our findings suggest that expression of HER1 only is correlated with worse DFS and OS. A better understanding of the functional relationships between these receptors may lead to a useful predictive indicator of response to targeted therapy.","title":"Co-expression of receptors of the HER family correlates with clinical outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","pubmedId":"24013863"}
