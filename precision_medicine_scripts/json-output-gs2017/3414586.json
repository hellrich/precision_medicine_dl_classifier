The identification of any single causal feature in human diet for colorectal cancer is an improbable outcome because of the complexity of neoplasia, interaction of dietary factors and carcinogens, and the varied forms of colorectal cancer. The same general dietary program advocated for reduced cardiovascular risk is probably suitable for cancer reduction as well.","title":"Diet and colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"3414586"}
