The clinicopathological features of EML4-ALK-positive adenocarcinoma are reported to include its high incidence in young, non-smoking patients, tumors that show distinct solid or acinar growth patterns with or without signet-ring cell histology, and its mutually exclusive occurrence with mutations in EGFR and KRAS. However, the clinical findings have not been well described. Here, we report a case of EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma that showed multiple metachronous lesions on the pleura and pulmonary field, suspected to be a recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma after a 20-year disease-free interval. The slow clinical course may be characteristic of EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, long-term observation of patients with EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinomas is required after surgery.","title":"Recurrent EML4-ALK-associated lung adenocarcinoma with a slow clinical course.","pubmedId":"20659620"}
