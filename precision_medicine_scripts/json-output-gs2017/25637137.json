In this study the safety and activity of the combination of COI regimen plus bevacizumab (COI-B) were assessed.\nPatients judged to be unresectable for metastatic disease, were enrolled in a phase II, open-label study and treated with the combination of bevacizumab (5mg/kg on day 1) and COI regimen (irinotecan 180mg/mq on day 1, oxaliplatin 85mg/mq on day 2, capecitabine 2000mg d2-6; q14) as first-line treatment. Induction treatment was administered for a maximum of 8 cycles, followed by maintenance treatment with bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg on d1, q21) until progression.\nFifty-one patients were enrolled in six Italian centres. The primary end-point of overall response rate was met, reaching the value of 62% in the per-protocol population and 57% in the intent-to-treat population, patients with stable disease were also taken into account, the clinical benefit rate was 94%. In the intention-to-treat population, median progression-free and overall survivals were 10.3 and 22 months, respectively. Toxicity was different from 5-fluorouracil-based triplet regimens, with 31% of severe diarrhoea, but a low incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia (6%) and mucositis (4%).\nOur results show the feasibility and promising activity of the combination of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab.","title":"Capecitabine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan in combination, with bevacizumab (COI-B regimen) as first-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
