In a targeted gene screening, we previously found that the minor allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6336 in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1 (NTRK1/TRKA) gene is associated with schizophrenia as a risk factor.\nWe genotyped the TRKA SNP in a total of eight independent Caucasian schizophrenia case-control groups.\nRemarkably, although in five of the groups a higher frequency of the risk allele was indeed found in the patients compared with the controls, in the three other groups the SNP acted as a protective factor.\nAn intriguing possibility is that this dual character of the TRKA SNP is caused by its interaction with endophenotypic and/or epistatic factors.","title":"Dual association of a TRKA polymorphism with schizophrenia.","pubmedId":"21317683"}
