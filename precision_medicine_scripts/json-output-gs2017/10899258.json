Additional photodynamic therapy seems to be a promising new approach to these tumors. First pilot studies show relief of jaundice, mainly because of opening of the intrahepatic ducts and improvements in quality of life indices. Survival time seems to be long; however, randomized studies are necessary to confirm these results.","title":"Photodynamic therapy of cholangiocarcinoma cancer.","pubmedId":"10899258"}
