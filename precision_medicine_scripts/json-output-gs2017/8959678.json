A secondary objective was to compare the clinical features of HIV-seropositive and HIV-indeterminate lung cancer cases at our institution.\nSixteen patients with HIV infection and lung cancer were diagnosed between January 1988 and March 1995 at our institution and the clinical records were reviewed. HIV-indeterminate lung cancer cases were identified by the Albany Medical Center Hospital (AMCH) Tumor Registry. A Medline database search of HIV infection/AIDS and lung cancer was undertaken through December 1994. The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), Bureau of Cancer Epidemiology provided information on the incidence of lung cancer among residents of New York State by county of residence. Case reports and series regarding the clinical features of HIV-seropositive patients with lung cancer were reviewed. A more focused comparison between HIV-seropositive and HIV-indeterminate male lung cancer cases between 35 and 54 years of age at our institution was performed. The following clinical variables were identified in our 16 patients and 109 cases extracted from available clinical reports: sex, age, year and county of residence at time of lung cancer diagnosis, cigarette smoking history, HIV risk behavior, CD4 count at time of lung cancer diagnosis, CDC classification of HIV disease, interval in months from time of HIV seropositivity to lung cancer diagnosis, pathology and stage of lung cancer, performance status, treatment, response, and survival.\nLung cancer in HIV-seropositive patients is characterized by the following: a younger age at time of diagnosis when compared to HIV-indeterminate cases; the majority of cases occur in a background of extensive cigarette smoking; over 80% of patients present with advanced stage of lung cancer (stage III and IV); up to 50% of cases have asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic HIV infection with a median CD4 lymphocyte count of 233 per microliter; there is a predominance of adenocarcinoma histopathology; and shortened survival when compared to HIV-indeterminate cases.\nCurrent reports of lung carcinoma in HIV-seropositive patients suggest that the natural history of this disease is different than in HIV-indeterminate cases. Lung cancer must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a solitary mass lesion on chest X-ray in HIV-seropositive patients.","title":"Lung cancer in patients with HIV-infection.","pubmedId":"8959678"}
