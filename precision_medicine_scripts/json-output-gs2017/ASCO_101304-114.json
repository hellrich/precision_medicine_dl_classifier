Previous work in a clinically enriched non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) population suggested low probability of an EGFR activating gene mutation in the absence of TTF-1 positivity (Somaiah ASCO 2011).  This study\u0027s goal was to validate the relationship of TTF-1 and other immunohistochemical (IHC) markers of EMT to the presence of an EGFR activating gene mutation in a diverse group of NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib.  Methods:  Patients receiving erlotinib at two midwest institutions were retrospectively analyzed by IHC for TTF-1 (Greater than 5% of tumor cells with moderate (2+) or strong (3+) nuclear staining considered positive) and for PTEN, Ecadherin,vimentin, beta catinin, and snail (frequency(0-4) times intensity(0-4)).  Exon 19 and L858R mutations were detectedusing single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)).Fishers exact testand logistic regression wereused to correlate TTF-1(positive or negative) and the remaining EMT markers with the presence of EGFR mutation.  Results:  216 patients were analyzed for EGFR activating gene mutations: 15% squamous, 80% smokers.  EGFR mutation was found in 11.6% of cases. TTF-1 was present in 8% of squamous cell patients and 71% of adenocarcinoma patients.  TTF-1 correlated with prolonged progression free survival (log rank p\u003d.004). TTF-1 positivity was strongly correlated with the presence of mutation (p\u003d.0006, negative predictive value\u003d97.7%).  Increasing Ecadherin and increasing PTEN expression by IHC correlated with the presence of EGFR gene mutation when measured on continuum (p\u003d.006 and p\u003d.04, respectively).  Conclusions:    Though retrospective, our work confirms the negative predictive value of TTF-1 for an EGFR activating gene mutation in a NSCLC cohort representative of a North American population.Though high PTEN and Ecadherin expression also correlated with EGFR mutation, TTF-1 positivity may be a more straight-forward marker that  can select patients who should be screened for the mutation prior to initiation of first line therapy.","title":"EGFR gene mutation and epithelial to mensenchymal transition (EMT) markers in advanced NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib.","pubmedId":"ASCO_101304-114"}
