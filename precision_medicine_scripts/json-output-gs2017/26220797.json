The aim of this study was to analyze the predictive value of the DNA index in a large single-center cohort of patients undergoing resection of HCCA.\nA total of 154 patients who underwent resection of HCCA were included in this prospective study. The DNA index was assessed by image cytometry of fresh tumor samples and correlated, as well as standard histopathological parameters, with patient survival.\nThe median DNA index was 1.61 ± 0.32. Univariate survival analysis identified eight parameters including DNA index, but not DNA ploidy as prognostic markers. In the Cox proportional hazard model DNA index (P \u003d 0.021), tumor size (P \u003d 0.029) and lymph nodes status (P \u003d 0.039) could be shown to be independent predictors of patient survival.\nThe DNA index represents an independent prognostic marker in HCCA which is superior to most standard histopathological factors. Since the DNA index can be assessed not only post- but also preoperatively, it might be a potential tool in the preoperative decision-making process.","title":"The DNA index as a prognostic tool in hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26220797"}
