Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathways play important roles in tumour angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine the role of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) in angiogenesis  and its correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in gastric adenocarcinoma.\nTumour tissue and matched healthy gastric mucosa were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection of gastric adenocarcinoma. Akt and pAkt were detected via Western blotting. VEGF-A,  pAkt and CD34 were examined by immunohistochemistry.\nAkt and pAkt protein levels were significantly higher in gastric cancer tissue than in normal tissue (n \u003d 48 patients). Positive VEGF-A immunostaining was significantly associated with pAkt immunostaining. Microvessel density  was correlated with both VEGF-A and pAkt positivity.\nPhosphorylated Akt and VEGF-A are involved in angiogenesis of gastric adenocarcinoma, and Akt activation may contribute to angiogenesis via VEGF-A upregulation. The PI3K/Akt/VEGF signalling pathway may be involved in gastric  adeno carcinoma.","title":"Protein kinase B phosphorylation correlates with vascular endothelial growth factor A and microvessel density in gastric adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23321169"}
