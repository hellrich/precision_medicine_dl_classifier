STK15 mRNA expression was measured in tumor tissues of 103 patients, using real-time quantitative PCR.\nThe T91A polymorphism lacked any prognostic information in our patient cohort. Interestingly though, STK15 mRNA expression was increased in invasive and high-grade tumors (p-values of 0.009 and 0.0001, respectively). Additionally, patients with superficial UCC (n \u003d 82) who had a tumor recurrence in the first year after surgery displayed elevated STK15 mRNA expression levels (p \u003d 0.009). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed an increased risk of tumor progression for patients with Ta tumors (n \u003d 62) and high STK15 expression (log-rank p \u003d 0.04). Furthermore, a decreased overall (log-rank p \u003d 0.006) and UCC-specific survival (log-rank p \u003d 0.001) were shown for patients with elevated STK15 mRNA levels.\nPatients with UCC and elevated levels of STK15 mRNA generally showed a more adverse disease course than patients with low levels. This may help in identifying patients in need of more aggressive treatment.","title":"The prognostic role of the STK15 T91A polymorphism and of STK15 mRNA expression in patients with urothelial cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"17465238"}
