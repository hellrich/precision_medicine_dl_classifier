There were 26 male and 22 female, aged from 38 to 72 years old with a mean of 63.6 years old.\nPerioperative management including percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage applied in 19 cases and portal vein embolization applied in 2 cases. Eight patients were treated with extrahepatic bile duct resection with or without parital hepatic segment II resection, 10 cases with perihilar hepatic resection (segment IVB, partial V, partial VIII, I), 28 cases with extended hemihepatectomy and 2 cases with central hepatic resection (segment IVB, V, VIII, I). R0 resection rate was 89.5% and the operative mortality was 2.1%. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate were 93.5%, 51.8% and 36.5%, respectively. Patients undergoing extended hepatic resection survived significantly longer than those undergoing partial hepatic resection (P \u003d 0.034).\nExtended hepatic resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma offers good outcomes with an acceptable mortality rate.","title":"[Experience from surgical resection for 48 cases of hilar cholangiocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"20021902"}
