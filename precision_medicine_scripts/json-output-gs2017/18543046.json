Preoperative CA19-9 levels of \u003c/\u003d150 kU/l (or \u003c/\u003d300 kU/l in the presence of bilirubin levels \u003e35 micromol/l) and a PLR of \u003c/\u003d160 were found to represent the optimal cut-off values to risk stratify patients. If both levels were elevated (n \u003d 8), patients had a median overall survival of 10.1 months. If either CA19-9 or PLR were elevated individually (n \u003d 23), patients had a median survival of 25.2 months. For cases where both levels were less than the cut-off values (n \u003d 21), the median overall survival time was not reached but was greater than 60 months (log rank, p \u003c 0.001). This preoperative risk stratification was found to remain a significant independent predictor of survival on multivariate analysis (Cox, p \u003d 0.001) alongside resection margin status (p \u003d 0.002) and tumor size (p \u003d 0.051).\nPreoperative CA19-9 and PLR both merit further evaluation as prognostic indices in resected ampullary adenocarcinoma.","title":"Prognosis of resected ampullary adenocarcinoma by preoperative serum CA19-9 levels and platelet-lymphocyte ratio.","pubmedId":"18543046"}
