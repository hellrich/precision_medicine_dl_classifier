Mutations in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1, a receptor phosphorylated by nerve growth factor, have been documented in diverse ethnic groups. We identified the same novel nonsense mutation in two unrelated families of Moroccan Jewish descent, each with two affected siblings. This possible founder mutation may trace to the rural Jewish village in southern Morocco from where both these families originated. Genetic screening for the causative mutation among 300 unrelated Moroccan Jews did not reveal carriers for the causative mutation, thus excluding high risk for CIPA in this ethnic subpopulation.","title":"Skoura - a genetic island for congenital insensitivity to pain and anhidrosis among Moroccan Jews, as determined by a novel mutation in the NTRK1 gene.","pubmedId":"19250380"}
