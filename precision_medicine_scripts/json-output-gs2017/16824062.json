Although previous studies have revealed that tumor budding at the invasive margin can be a marker for the malignant potential of T1 colorectal carcinomas, the evaluation of tumor budding has not been standardized as yet. In the present study, we attempted to apply the actual number of tumor budding units for the individualization of treatment in T1 colorectal carcinomas.\nIn 76 T1 colorectal carcinomas, associations between lymph node metastasis and clinicopathological parameters were examined statistically. A mathematical formula for predicting the risk of lymph node metastasis was constructed and decision analysis was attempted to determine individually the indication for additional surgery after endoscopic mucosal resection of T1 colorectal carcinomas.\nOf the clinicopathological parameters examined, multivariate analysis showed that the actual number of tumor budding units alone was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. The probability of lymph node metastasis was calculated as Z \u003d 0.07 x (budding counts) - 3.726, probability \u003d 1/1 + e(-Z). The more the budding counts, the higher the probability of lymph node metastasis. This formula was able to accurately predict lymph node metastasis in successive cases. The actual number of tumor budding units can be applied to decision analysis in determining an indication for additional surgery after endoscopic mucosal resection of T1 colorectal carcinomas.\nThe actual number of tumor budding units may be useful in the decision making for patient-oriented treatment of T1 colorectal carcinomas.","title":"Actual number of tumor budding as a new tool for the individualization of treatment of T1 colorectal carcinomas.","pubmedId":"16824062"}
