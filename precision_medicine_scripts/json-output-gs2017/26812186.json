However, observational evidence has led to speculation that mCRC patients with KRAS G13D mutant (MT) tumours may derive a benefit from treatment with anti-EGFR mAbs.\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate whether the efficacy of anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC differs between tumours harbouring a KRAS G13D mutation (KRAS G13D) and KRAS mutations other than G13D (other KRAS MT).\nEight RCTs (n \u003d 5967) met the inclusion criteria for assessment of both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). For other KRAS MT the hazard ratio for OS benefit with addition of anti-EGFR mAb therapy was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.96, 1.17), compared to 1.08 (95% CI; 0.73, 1.60) for KRAS G13D [test for interaction p\u003d0.99]. In contrast, the hazard ratio for KRAS wild-type (WT) tumours was 0.85 (95% CI; 0.76, 0.95). Regarding PFS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs, the hazard ratio was 1.07 (95% CI; 0.92, 1.26) for other KRAS MT, 0.96 (95% CI; 0.73, 1.27) for KRAS G13D, and 0.68 (95% CI; 0.54, 0.85) for KRAS WT. Again, the test for interaction (p\u003d0.46) demonstrated no significant difference in PFS benefit for anti-EGFR mAb therapy between KRAS G13D and other KRAS MT.\nThis meta-analysis demonstrates no significant difference between KRAS G13D and other KRAS MT tumours in terms of treatment benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC.","title":"Meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy between KRAS G13D and other KRAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer tumours.","pubmedId":"26812186"}
