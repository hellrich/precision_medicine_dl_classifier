However, 5% to 20% of tumors only are regarded as resectable, and, among them, only few benefit from an histological complete resection, major survival parameter. These data explain the overall poor prognosis of this disease, with a respectively 20% and 5% 1- and 5-year survival rates. These results justify an adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapeutic approach, mainly based on concurrent chemoradiation, with and without surgery. This paper reviews the different therapeutic approaches of non metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"[Chemoradiation for pancreatic adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"15679252"}
