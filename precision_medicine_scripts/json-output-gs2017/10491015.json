The Met proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor (Met) that has the capacity to regulate cell proliferation and differentation and it is activated by hepatocyte growth factor. Trisomy of chromosome 7 and Met protein overexpression have been were observed in ovarian carcinomas, the papillary renal cancers and other solid tumors. Frequent mutations of Met proto-oncogene have been found in hereditary papillary renal cancer (HPRC) and most of the mutations are located in the tyrosine kinase domain. The aim of this study to perform a mutation analysis of exons 17 19 of Met proto-oncogene in epithelial ovarian tumors (EOTs). We have examined 24 tumor samples from patients, operated with EOTs. Mutation was detected in exon 18 in only one sample of 24 EOTs. Our results indicate that mutations located in the Met proto-oncogene is not a common event in EOT. It is not clear whether the mutation plays a role in the tumorigenesis or progression of EOT or not.","title":"Evaluation of the tyrosine kinase domain of the Met proto-oncogene in sporadic ovarian carcinomas*.","pubmedId":"10491015"}
