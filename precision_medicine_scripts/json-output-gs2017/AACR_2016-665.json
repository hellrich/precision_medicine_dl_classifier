The very high rate of mutant Kras occurs in pancreatic cancer (\u003e90%) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (panIN) (\u003e50%). However, the key signaling pathway of downstream Kras remains unidentified.We previously uncovered that the NF-B signaling pathway was constitutively activated in most PDAC specimens and pancreatic cancer cell lines. More recently, our results showed that constitutive NF-B activity in PDAC was induce by IL-1 autocrine mechanism. IL-1/p62 feedforward loops that initiated by the mutant Kras sustained NF-B activity and were required for pancreatic cancer development. Therefore, we hypothesize that blocking IL-1 - NF-B signaling pathway will inhibit Kras-induced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.To identify the mechanistic role of mutant Kras-induced IL-1 expression in PDAC, we generated genetically engineered mice of Pdx1-cre/Kras LSL-G12D/p53 M/+IL-1/. Our findings revealed that these mutant mice had developed significantly less PDAC number and a significantly delayed PDAC at old ages. Furthermore, we assess the effect of pharmacological IL-1R1 antagonist (anakinra) in human pancreatic cancer cell lines and orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse. We found that IL-1R1 antagonist significantly decreased NF-B activity and inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. More interestingly, the combinational treatment IL-1R1 antagonist plus gemcitabine significantly reduced the tumor burden in orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse.These results suggested that pharmacologically targeting IL-1 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for pancreatic cacner.","title":"Blocking IL-1-NF-kB axis inhibits Kras-induced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-665"}
