About 10%-15% of GIST do not harbor any mutations in the c-kit and PDGFRA genes and are defined as wild-type GIST. There are significant differences in molecular mechanism and clinical characteristics between wild-type GIST and mutant GIST. Wild-type GIST should be considered as a family of diseases due to their extreme heterogeneity. Clinician should pay close attention to the diagnosis and treatment of wild-type GIST.
