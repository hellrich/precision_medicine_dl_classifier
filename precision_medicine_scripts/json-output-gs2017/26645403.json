A dose-escalation schedule consisted of two doses of S-1 (60 and 80 mg/m(2) twice daily) for 2 weeks in alternate-day administration, three doses of irinotecan (125, 150, and 180 mg/m(2)) on day 1, and a single dose of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of a 2-week cycle. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed in the first four cycles to determine the maximum tolerated dose. This clinical study was registered at UMIN000014339.\nFifteen patients received this regimen (median, eight cycles; range 4-12). At dose level 3 (S-1, 80 mg/m(2); irinotecan, 150 mg/m(2)), 2/6 patients experienced DLTs of grade 3 fatigue and grade 4 neutropenia. At dose level 4, all three patients experienced DLTs: grade 3 fatigue (n \u003d 1) and grade 4 neutropenia (n \u003d 2). The RD was 80, 85, and 150 mg/m(2) of S-1, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, respectively. We found the following: response rate, 47 %; disease control rate, 80%; median progression-free survival, 6.7 months; overall survival, 13.4 months.\nThe SOXIRI regimen\u0027s RD is 80, 85, and 150 mg/m(2) of S-1, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, respectively.","title":"Phase I study assessing the feasibility of the triple combination chemotherapy of SOXIRI (S-1/oxaliplatin/irinotecan) in patients with unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26645403"}
