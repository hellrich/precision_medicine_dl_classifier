The patients were taken from a series of 170 patients who underwent surgery between 1993 and 1997 and whose data were recorded by the Bronchogenic Carcinoma Cooperative Group of the Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery (GCCB-S). In 26 patients, nodes were found in the upper mediastinum; in three patients nodes were paraesophageal or in the area of the pulmonary ligament. In 11 cases, extracapsular nodal disease was found. Three patients who died in the postoperative period were excluded from survival analysis.\nThe five-year survival rate for the series of 170 patients was 39%. For the 26 patients with N2 carcinoma, five-year survival was 14% (median 12 months). Five-year survival for the remaining patients (excluding those with N2 carcinoma) was 46%. Although the median survival of patients with intracapsular nodal disease was more than twice (25 months) that of patients with extracapsular nodal disease (12 months), the difference was not significant.\nLung resection in patients with N2 bronchogenic carcinoma with negative mediastinoscopy has little impact on survival. Surgical exploration of the mediastinum classifies such patients with greatest certainty, although the sensitivity of staging techniques warrants improvement to assure that thoracotomy is not used unnecessarily.","title":"[Results of the surgical treatment of pathologic bronchogenic carcinoma N2 with negative mediastinoscopy].","pubmedId":"11000924"}
