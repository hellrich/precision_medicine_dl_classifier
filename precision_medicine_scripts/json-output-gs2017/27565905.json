We report a case in which gefitinib- and elrotinib-induced severe hepatotoxicity arose in a patient with the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1 (UGT1A1) and cytochrome p450 3A5 (CYP3A5) poor metabolizer phenotypes. Afatinib is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome p450-mediated pathways. We describe successful management of the patient\u0027s tumor by switching to afatinib. Evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in metabolic enzymes might be useful to predict severe hepatotoxicity induced by EGFR-TKIs.
