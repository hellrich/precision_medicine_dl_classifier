The human TRKA gene on chromosome 1q21-q22 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase for nerve growth factor and is responsible for an autosomal recessive genetic disorder: congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA). We report here the second case of paternal UPD for chromosome 1 in a male patient with CIPA who developed normally at term and did not show overt dysmorphisms or malformations. He had only the usual features of CIPA with a homozygous mutation at the TRKA locus and a normal karyotype with no visible deletions or evidence of monosomy 1. Haplotype analysis of the TRKA locus and allelotype analyses of whole chromosome 1 revealed that the chromosome pair was exclusively derived from his father. Non-maternity was excluded by analyses of autosomes other than chromosome 1. Thus, we have identified a complete paternal isodisomy for chromosome 1 as the cause of reduction to homozygosity of the TRKA gene mutation, leading to CIPA. Our findings further support the idea that there are no paternally imprinted genes on chromosome 1 with a major effect on phenotype. UPD must be considered as a rare but possible cause of autosomal recessive disorders when conducting genetic testing.","title":"Complete paternal uniparental isodisomy for chromosome 1 revealed by mutation analyses of the TRKA (NTRK1) gene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase for nerve growth factor in a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.","pubmedId":"11071380"}
