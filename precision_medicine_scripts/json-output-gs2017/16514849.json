The cytomorphologic features in intraoperative imprint smears from 2 cases of desmoplastic medulloblastoma are described.\nA 22-year-old man and 27-year-old woman with a cerebellar tumor underwent craniotomy and tumor resection. The imprint cytologic smears contained cellular zones and nodular hypocellular areas containing astroglial and oligodendrogliallike elements. The cytology was misinterpreted as glial tumors, while the final histologic diagnosis in both cases were desmoplastic medulloblastoma.\nDesmoplastic medulloblastoma shows distinctive cytology in intraoperative smears. However, the occurrence of this rare type in adults and the presence of astroglial elements in imprint smears may cause a cytologic misinterpretation as gliomas.","title":"Cytology of desmoplastic medulloblastoma in imprint smears: a report of 2 cases.","pubmedId":"16514849"}
