Dual blockade has been explored and one such agent, lapatinib, is in clinical practice but with modest activity. Through chemical screening, we discovered a novel EGFR and HER2 inhibitor, S-222611, that selectively inhibited both kinases with IC50 s below 10 nmol/L. S-222611 also inhibited intracellular kinase activity and the growth of EGFR-expressing and HER2-expressing cancer cells. In addition, S-222611 showed potent antitumor activity over lapatinib in a variety of xenograft models. In evaluations with two patient-oriented models, the intrafemoral implantation model and the intracranial implantation model, S-222611 exhibited excellent activity and could be effective against bone and brain metastasis. Compared to neratinib and afatinib, irreversible EGFR/HER2 inhibitors, S-222611 showed equivalent or slightly weaker antitumor activity but a safer profile. These results indicated that S-222611 is a potent EGFR and HER2 inhibitor with substantially better antitumor activity than lapatinib at clinically relevant doses. Considering the safer profile than for irreversible inhibitors, S-222611 could be an important option in future cancer therapy.","title":"Preclinical antitumor activity of S-222611, an oral reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2.","pubmedId":"24837299"}
