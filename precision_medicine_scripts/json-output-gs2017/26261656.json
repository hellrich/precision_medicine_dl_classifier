Occasionally, this type of adenocarcinoma is associated with solid-predominant adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutations are predominant in adenocarcinoma with morule-like components, followed by ALK rearrangements. Herein, we present 2 cases of solid-predominant adenocarcinoma with morule-like components harboring either an EGFR or KRAS mutation. This KRAS-mutant case is the first to be associated with morule-like components, to the best of our knowledge. Both cases showed transition between micropapillary and morule-like components. Transition between morule-like and solid components was also observed in both cases. Although a few cases of solid-predominant adenocarcinoma have been shown to harbor morule-like components, this type of transition has not been previously well described. We surmised that the solid components of some EGFR-mutant adenocarcinomas might be derived from morule-like components.","title":"Transition between morule-like and solid components may occur in solid-predominant adenocarcinoma of the lung: report of 2 cases with EGFR and KRAS mutations.","pubmedId":"26261656"}
