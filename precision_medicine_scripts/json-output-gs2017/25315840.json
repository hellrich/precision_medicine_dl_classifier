Conversely, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) refers to GOR that causes troublesome symptoms with or without complications such as damage to the oesophagus (Vandenplas 2009). Currently there is no evidence to support the range of measures recommended to help alleviate acid reflux experienced by infants. Non-nutritive sucking (NNS) has been used as an intervention to modulate neonatal state behaviours through its pacifying effects such as decrease infant fussiness and crying during feeds (Boiron 2007; Pickler 2004).\nTo determine if NNS reduces GORD in preterm infants (less than 37 weeks\u0027 gestation) and low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, three months of age and less, with signs or symptoms suggestive of GORD, or infants with a diagnosis of GORD.\nWe performed computerised searches of the electronic databases of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 9, 2013), MEDLINEÂ (1966 to September 2013), CINAHL (1982 to September 2013), and EMBASE (1988 to September 2013). We applied no language restrictions.\nControlled trials using random or quasi-random allocation of preterm infants (less than 37 weeks\u0027 gestation) and low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants three months of age and less with signs or symptoms suggestive of GORD, or infants with a diagnosis of GORD. We included studies reported only by abstracts, and cluster and cross-over randomised trials.\nTwo review authors independently reviewed and selected trials from searches, assessed and rated study quality and extracted relevant data. We identified two studies from the initial search. After further review, we excluded both studies.\nWe identified no studies examining the effects of NNS for GORD in preterm and low birth weight infants\nThere was insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of NNS for GORD. Adequately powered RCTs on the effect of NNS in preterm and low birth weight infants diagnosed with GORD are required.","title":"Non-nutritive sucking for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in preterm and low birth weight infants.","pubmedId":"25315840"}
