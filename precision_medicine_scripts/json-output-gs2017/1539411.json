Hematuria may result from either direct invasion of the kidneys or from metastases to the urinary tract. The bladder may be involved in the late stages from metastases, but rarely is it associated with hematuria since mucosal involvement is very unusual. We report a second case of bladder metastases and hematuria as a presenting symptom of pancreatic carcinoma.","title":"Metastasis to the bladder from pancreatic adenocarcinoma presenting with hematuria.","pubmedId":"1539411"}
