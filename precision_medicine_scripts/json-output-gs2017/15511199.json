The first symptoms were in order of frequency, arthralgias, loss of weight, arthritis, diarrhoea, fever, epigastric pain and neurologic symptoms. Three were treated with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazol and one with cefixime. There were no recurrences.\nThe endoscopic appearance of the duodenum is fundamental for the suspicion of the disease. The initial parenteral treatment may consist of ceftriaxone and try to avoid using streptomycine because of its toxicity, followed by oral trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazol. As an alternative to the latter, cefixime is usually effective. The typical findings of the duodenum biopsy can persist several months or years after finishing the treatment, decreasing the value of endoscopic pursuit after treatment.","title":"[Controversies about the clinical management of Whipple\u0027s disease].","pubmedId":"15511199"}
