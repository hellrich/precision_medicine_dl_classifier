How PTEN loss mediates these effects is unknown. Here we show that loss of PTEN in epithelial and melanocytic cell lines induces the nuclear localization and transcriptional activation of β-catenin independent of the PI3K-AKT-GSK3β axis. The absence of PTEN leads to caveolin-1 (CAV1)-dependent β-catenin transcriptional modulation in vitro, cooperates with NRAS(Q61K) to initiate melanomagenesis in vivo and induces efficient metastasis formation associated with E-cadherin internalization. The CAV1-β-catenin axis is mediated by a feedback loop in which β-catenin represses transcription of miR-199a-5p and miR-203, which suppress the levels of CAV1 mRNA in melanoma cells. These data reveal a mechanism by which loss of PTEN increases CAV1-mediated dissociation of β-catenin from membranous E-cadherin, which may promote senescence bypass and metastasis.
