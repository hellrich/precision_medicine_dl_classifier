Platinum-based chemotherapy has been reported to be effective for patients with postoperative stage I to IIIA NSCLC in western countries. On the other hand, uracil-tegafur was also shown to improve survival among patients with stage I adenocarcinoma in Japan. We reviewed the results of recent randomized trials and meta-analyses, and discuss the current role and problems related to adjuvant chemotherapy in NSCLC.","title":"[Adjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"17197740"}
