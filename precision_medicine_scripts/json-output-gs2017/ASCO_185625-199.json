Here we explore whether the combination of ALKi (ceritinib) and PD1-inhibitor (NIVO) will provide sustained clinical benefit to pts with ALK+ NSCLC. Methods: This phase 1 dose escalation study enrolled previously treated (ALK inhibitor [ALKi] or chemotherapy) or tx-naive pts with stage IIIB/IV ALK+ NSCLC; who received NIVO 3 mg/kg IV Q2W + ceritinib with low-fat meal, at 450 mg/day (group 1) or 300 mg/day (group 2) until progression/unacceptable toxicity. Primary objective: MTD/recommended dose for expansion. Dose escalation was guided by Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. Results: Median follow-up: group 1 (n \u003d 14) 13 mos (10-15); group 2 (n \u003d 22) 6 mos (2-10). As of 9 Sep 2016, 16/36 (44%) pts discontinued tx: disease progression (11 [31%] pts), AEs (3 [8%] pts), and death (2 [6%] pts). In group 1, 4 pts experienced DLT: pancreatitis (n \u003d 2), lipase and transaminase increase (n \u003d 1), and autoimmune hepatitis (n \u003d 1). In group 2, 2 pts experienced DLT: G3 ALT increase. Both dose levels met Bayesian criteria for dose expansion. Overall most frequent (40%) AEs (n \u003d 36), were diarrhea (64%), ALT increase (56%), AST increase (44%) and vomiting (42%). Most frequent ( \u003e 10%) grade 3 AEs were increases in ALT (22%), GGT (17%), amylase (11%), and lipase (11%), and maculopapular rash (11%). Incidence of rash (grouped term) was 61%; similar in both groups. Grade 3 rash was reported in 29% pts in group 1 and 14% pts in group 2. Preliminary ceritinib steady state PK (AUC0-24 and Cmax) suggested that 300 mg/day exposure was ~ 70-75% of 450 mg/day. Confirmed (c)/unconfirmed (u) ORR: ALKi-pretreated pts (group 1 [n \u003d 8], group 2 [n \u003d 12]) was 63% (4 cPR,1 uPR; 95% CI: 25%, 92%), and 33% (4 uPR) 95% CI: 10%, 65%) respectively; ALKi-nave pts, (group 1 [n \u003d 6], group 2 [n \u003d 10]) was 83% (5 cPR; 95% CI: 36%, 100%), and 70% (1 cCR, 3 cPR 3uPR; 95% CI: 35%, 93%) respectively. Conclusions: Ceritinib + NIVO is an active combination in ALK+ NSCLC. However, the protocol will be amended to address observed toxicities. Data will be updated for presentation.
