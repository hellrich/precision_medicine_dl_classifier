The purpose of this study is to investigate whether this polymorphism is related to the genetic susceptibility of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\nA total 150 patients and 150 normal people were included in this study, the Ser326Cys polymorphisms in each group were genotyped using PCR-RFLP method.\nWe found that individuals carrying Cys/Cys genotype were exposed to higher riskof intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (OR\u003d2.924, 95% CI\u003d1.475-5.780) compared with the individuals with wild type genotype Ser/Ser. Further analysis revealed that male individuals carrying Cys/Cys genotype also had increased risk (OR\u003d2.762, 95% CI\u003d1.233-6.173), whereas no significant difference was observed in female group.\nTherefore, our data indicates that the Ser326Cys (rs1052133) polymorphism is associated with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma susceptibility, and it shows preference in male population.","title":"The Ser326Cys polymorphism of hOGG1 is associated with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma susceptibility in a Chinese population.","pubmedId":"26629147"}
