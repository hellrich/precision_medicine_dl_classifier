The cases have been classified according to the type of the initial intervention as follows: re-interventions following cholecystectomy, choledocotomy and Kehr drainage, following sphincterotomy, and following internal and external biliary derivations. An analysis is made of the causes of re-interventions, and of the increased risk due to severe complications which are at the origin of high morbidity and mortality rates. Particular stress is laid on the necessity for a correct diagnosis, as well as a complete one for the first intervention on the biliary pathways, which will allow to make an adequate choice for a second surgical solution.","title":"[Reoperations on the extrahepatic bile ducts after surgery of the common bile duct or its indirect drainage].","pubmedId":"6211698"}
