The optimal mode of therapy is still controversial and management during pregnancy is challenging because foetal well-being must also be considered. We report a patient with clinically stage IIB large-cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma who presented with a cervical polyp and vaginal bleeding at 18 weeks of pregnancy. The patient received concurrent chemotherapy and radiation after termination of pregnancy and remained in complete remission 21 months after completion of treatment.","title":"Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix complicating pregnancy.","pubmedId":"19197101"}
