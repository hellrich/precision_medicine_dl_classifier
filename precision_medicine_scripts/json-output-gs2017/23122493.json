Lung adenocarcinomas also harbor activating mutations in the downstream GTPase, v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS), and mutations in EGFR and KRAS appear to be mutually exclusive. Even though KRAS mutations were identified in NSCLC tumors more than 20 years ago, we have only just begun to appreciate the clinical value of determining KRAS tumor status. Recent studies indicate that patients with mutant KRAS tumors fail to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy and do not respond to EGFR inhibitors. There is a clear need for therapies specifically developed for patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC. In this review, we summarize the clinical and pathologic characteristics of patients with NSCLC and with KRAS mutations, describe work that explores the predictive and prognostic influence of KRAS mutations, and provide an overview of the \"synthetic lethal\" interactions and current approaches to targeting KRAS-mutant NSCLC.","title":"KRAS mutations in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23122493"}
