Additionally, all the patients were treated with first-line gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP) chemotherapy and second-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or with first-line EGFR-TKI and second-line GP chemotherapy.\nThe median survival of 61 cases with third-line pemetrexed monotherapy was 36.22 months, the median survival time of 55 cases with third-line pemetrexed plus bevacizumab was 38.76 months, and there was a significant difference in survival time between the two groups (P\u003d0.04). Subgroup analysis revealed that among the 55 cases with third-line bevacizumab plus pemetrexed treatment, the median survival of 29 patients with first-line GP and second-line EGFR-TKI was 42.80 months, while the median survival of 26 patients with first-line EGFR-TKI and second-line GP was only 34.46 months; additionally, there was a significant difference in the survival time between the two subgroups (P\u003d0.001). Among 61 cases with third-line pemetrexed treatment, the median survival of 34 patients with first-line GP and second-line EGFR-TKI was 38.72 months, while the median survival of 27 patients with first-line EGFR-TKI and second-line GP was only 32.94 months; the survival time of the two subgroups was significantly different (P\u003d0.001).\nRegardless of the order of the first- and second-line chemotherapy and TKI therapy, the pemetrexed plus bevacizumab regimen was superior to the pemetrexed monotherapy as the third-line therapy in patients with advanced EGFR-positive lung adenocarcinoma. However, this strategy is worth further investigation in prospective studies.","title":"Efficacy of third-line pemetrexed monotherapy versus pemetrexed combination with bevacizumab in patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25561769"}
