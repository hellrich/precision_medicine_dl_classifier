Overall, the risk for developing cancer at ages 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 years was 1%, 3%, 19%, 32%, 63%, and 81%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed similar cancer risks between missense and truncating mutation carriers (log-rank chi(2) \u003d 2.48; P \u003d 0.12). There was some evidence that mutations in exon 3 of STK11 were associated with a higher cancer risk than mutations within other regions of the gene. We found no difference in overall cancer risk between male and female carriers (log-rank chi(2) \u003d 1.31; P \u003d 0.25) or between familial and sporadic cases (log-rank chi(2) \u003d 1.16, with 1 df; P \u003d 0.28). The most common cancers represented were gastrointestinal in origin--gastroesophageal, small bowel, colorectal, and pancreatic--and the risk for these cancers at ages 30, 40, 50, and 60 years was 1%, 10%, 18%, and 42%, respectively. In women, the risk for breast cancer was substantially increased, being 32% by age 60 years.\nThese results quantitatively show the spectrum of cancer risk associated with STK11 germline mutations in the context of PJS and provide a valuable reference for defining surveillance regimens.","title":"Relative frequency and morphology of cancers in STK11 mutation carriers.","pubmedId":"15188174"}
