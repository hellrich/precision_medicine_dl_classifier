The mean age was 61 years, median age 64 years. The most frequent localization of the tumour was stomach in 74 patients (40.4 %) and the small intestine in 46 patients (25.1 %). Two or more different synchronous or metachronous cancers occurred in 34 (18.6 %) patients with histologically confirmed GIST. Ninety-six patients were treated with imatinib mesylate in palliative setting during the course of their disease. The therapy was finished in 60 patients and 36 patients have been treated so far. The median progression-free survival reached 32.9 months in the group of 96 patients treated with imatinib. The median overall survival in the group of 96 patients treated for metastatic disease reached 77 months. Two-year and 5-year survival was 85.2 % and 63.1 %, respectively. The second-line therapy with sunitinib malate was administered in 37 patients, of which 31 finished and 6 continued in the therapy. The median progression free survival and median survival since the sunitinib therapy initiation reached 8.4 and 22.1 months, respectively (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 16).
