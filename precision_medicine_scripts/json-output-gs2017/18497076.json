The spectrum of individual genes involved in the initiation and progression of cancer is greatly influenced by genetic factors unique to each patient. A study of complex diseases such as cancer is complicated by the genetic heterogeneous background and environmental factors in the human population. Endometrial cancer (EC) is ranked fourth among invasive tumors in women. In Sweden, approximately 1300 women (27/100,000 women) are diagnosed annually. To be able to study the genetic alterations in cancer, the use of an animal model is very convenient. Females of the BDII strain are genetically predisposed to EC and 90% of female BDII rats develop EC during their lifetime. Thus, BDII rats have been used to model human EC with respect to the genetics of susceptibility and of tumor development. A set of rat EC tumors was analyzed using conventional cytogenetics and comparative genome hybridization (CGH). Chromosomal aberrations, i.e., gains, were found on rat chromosome 4 (RNO4). Using FISH analysis, we concluded that the Met oncogene and Cdk6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 6) were amplified in this set of EC tumors. The data from this investigation were used to analyze a set of human endometrial tumors for amplification of Cdk6 and Met. Our preliminary data are indicative for a good correlation between our findings in the BDII rat model for EAC and the situation in human EC. These data provide strong support for the use of animal model systems for better understanding and scrutinizing of human complex disease of cancer.","title":"Amplification studies of MET and Cdk6 in a rat endometrial tumor model and their correlation to human type I endometrial carcinoma tumors.","pubmedId":"18497076"}
