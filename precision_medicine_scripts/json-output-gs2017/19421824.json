The aim of this study was to clarify useful prognostic factors and the usefulness of gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who had undergone aggressive surgical resection.\nMedical records of 42 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection were reviewed retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate models were used to analyze the effect of various clinicopathological factors on long-term survival.\nOverall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of the 42 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma were 81%, 42%, and 30%, respectively (median survival time, 21.5 months). Univariate analysis revealed that adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and surgical margin status were associated significantly with long-term survival (P \u003c 0.05). Furthermore, use of a Cox proportional hazards regression model indicated that only adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy was a significant independent predictor of a favorable prognosis (P \u003d 0.035). The toxicity of adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy was mild. Five-year actuarial survival rates of patients who did or did not receive adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy were 57% and 23%, respectively (P \u003d 0.026).\nPostoperative adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy may be a promising strategy to improve survival after surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. A prospective randomized study should be done to confirm the results of this study.","title":"Gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival after aggressive surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19421824"}
