The research method was selective screening with identification of risk factors regarding the evolution of colorectal polyps in early cancer, using colonoscopy and histopathological examination.\nWe identified 464 single or multiple isolated polyps of which 399 were adenomas, 59 hyperplastic polyps and 6 other types of lesions. Histologically we recorded 41 (13.27%) polyps with a low grade of dysplasia, 56 (18.12%) with severe dysplasia and 30 (9.7%) intramucosal adenocarcinoma with submucosal invasion.\nColonoscopic polypectomy was used for benign polyps and in situ carcinoma. In case of adenocarcinoma is probable the invasion of submucosal lymphatics being shown a colorectal resection as appropriate. We performed 279 colonoscopic polypectomies and 30 conventional resections.\nHigh grade of dysplasia, the number of polyps, ulceration, bleeding, intraepithelial areas of neoplastic transformation are predictive factors for early colorectal cancer. Depth of submucosal invasion of malignant transformed polyps are important pathological factors to predict lymphatic metastasis and to select the therapeutic procedure.","title":"[Correlation of adenomatous polyps and early colorectal cancer.
