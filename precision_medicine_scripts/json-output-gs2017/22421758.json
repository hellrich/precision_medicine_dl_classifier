For curative resection, and to avoid unnecessary resection, it is important to diagnose and find the stage of pancreatic carcinoma correctly. CTis the most widely available and most validated imaging modality for this purpose. In this article, we reviewed the effective CTprotocols for detecting pancreatic carcinoma and the CTimaging findings of pancreatic carcinoma that will effect the resectability of the tumor. We also reviewed advantages and disadvantages of other imaging modalities, and imaging findings of some pancreatic carcinomas other than ductal adenocarcinoma.","title":"[Radiological evaluation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"22421758"}
