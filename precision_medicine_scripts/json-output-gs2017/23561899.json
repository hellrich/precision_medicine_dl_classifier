This fusion gene is detected with a break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. Phase I to III trials have shown an interesting disease control rate and acceptable tolerability. Crizotinib is available in France under temporary use authorization. New potentially effective therapeutics in ALK-positive NSCLC are being developed.","title":"[Crizotinib: a targeted therapy in advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"23561899"}
