These events significantly impair the patient\u0027s quality of life and place a significant burden on health-care resources.\nThis review focuses on the management options for reducing skeletal morbidity in patients with prostate cancer, including life-style modifications, food supplementation, osteoclast-targeted therapy and selective estrogen-receptor modulators.\nThe use of osteoclast-targeted therapy (denosumab and zoledronic acid) is supported by the strongest evidence and has been US Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of patients with PCa at high risk of osteoporotic fractures and for the reduction of the risk of skeletal-related events in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Ongoing trials are studying the potential role of osteoclast-targeted therapy in other settings throughout the course of the disease.","title":"Preventing bone complications in prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"22871982"}
