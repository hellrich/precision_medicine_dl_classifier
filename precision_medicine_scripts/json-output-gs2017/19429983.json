Twenty-four dogs and 17 cats were submitted to a 2-year follow-up study, and clinicopathologic features were recorded and compared with immunohistochemical PTEN staining. PTEN-negative status occurred in 33% of canine and 76% of feline mammary carcinomas. In canine mammary carcinomas, there was a significant (P \u003c .05) correlation between loss of PTEN protein expression and simple carcinoma histotype, lymphatic vessel invasion, lymph node metastases, distant organ metastases, tumor dedifferentiation, tumor recurrence, and shorter overall survival. In feline mammary tumors, a significant correlation between loss of PTEN protein expression and lymphatic vessel invasion was found. Loss of PTEN expression could be a useful prognostic marker in canine mammary carcinomas.","title":"Reduced PTEN protein expression and its prognostic implications in canine and feline mammary tumors.","pubmedId":"19429983"}
