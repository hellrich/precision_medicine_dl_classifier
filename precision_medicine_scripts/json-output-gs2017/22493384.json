We reported the case of one patient with pancreatic metastasis from colon carcinoma in the past and would like to add another six cases of pancreatic metastases from different types of cancer. The diagnosis of cancer metastatic to the pancreas should be suspected when patients have a history of malignancy, especially of kidney, skin, lung, colon and breast cancer. Besides imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) scan, bone scan and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided biopsy has most value in ruling out second primary pancreatic cancer. The prognosis of pancreatic metastases is essentially determined by the underlying primary cancer and the potential treatment options.","title":"Secondary tumors of the pancreas: a case series.","pubmedId":"22493384"}
