However, in the last ten years, several specific genetic alterations have been described allowing a molecular classification with: 1) sarcomas with a specific translocation which can be used as a diagnostic marker. These translocations can be demonstrated by RT-PCR or by FISH with commercially available break apart probes ; 2) sarcomas with simple genomic profile showing amplification of a few genes. Well differentiated liposarcomas, dedifferentiated liposarcomas and intimal sarcomas show a simple genomic profile characterised by MDM2 and CDK4 amplifications associated with amplification of other genes in dedifferentiated liposarcomas ; 3) sarcomas with activating mutations: about 90% of GIST show activating mutation of a receptor tyrosine kinase gene, either KIT or PDGFRA. The most frequent mutation involves exon 11 of KIT followed by exon 9 of KIT and exon 18 of PDGFRA. Demonstration of these mutations is useful for the diagnosis of CD117 negative GIST, for predicting response to imatinib and to explain secondary resistance to imatinib ; 4) sarcomas with inactivating mutations: malignant rhabdoid tumors show biallelic inactivation of INI1 gene with a lost of INI1 expression which can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry ; 5) other sarcomas usually show a complex genomic profile characterised by numerous gains and losses of genes with a frequent loss of RB1 and alterations of P53. Leiomyosarcomas, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas, pleomorphic liposarcomas, myxofibrosarcomas, poorly differentiated sarcomas (so-called MFH and fibrosarcomas) belong to this category and show no specific molecular abnormality.","title":"[Molecular biology of soft-tissue sarcomas].","pubmedId":"21084242"}
