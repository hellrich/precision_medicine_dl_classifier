Seven patients received oral crizotinib at a dose of 250 mg twice daily; 12 patients were administered standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed, paclitaxel, vinorelbine or gemcitabine plus either cisplatin or carboplatin) every three weeks for up to six cycles. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety.\nThe ORR was significantly higher with crizotinib than with chemotherapy (83.3% in the crizotinib vs. 25.0% in the chemotherapy group, P \u003c 0.05); the DCRs were 100% and 75%, respectively (P \u003c 0.05). The common adverse events associated with crizotinib were visual abnormality and diarrhea, whereas those associated with chemotherapy were neutropenia and nausea. In the crizotinib group, liver aminotransferase elevation (adverse events grade 3 or 4) occurred in one patient (14.3%). In the chemotherapy group, the same grade neutropenia adverse event occurred in two patients (16.6%). The incidence of treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar in both groups. Compared with chemotherapy, crizotinib was associated with a greater reduction in lung cancer symptoms and a greater improvement in quality of life.\nAs a first-line treatment, crizotinib was superior to platinum-based double chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, crizotinib is an optimal therapy as a first-line treatment in these patients.","title":"Crizotinib versus platinum-based double-agent chemotherapy as the first line treatment in advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26816533"}
