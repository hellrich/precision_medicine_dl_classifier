To date, only 11 cases have been reported in the English literature. Here, we present a new case of appendiceal gastrointestinal stromal tumor associated with complete situs inversus. A 48-year-old man was operated on due to appendicitis-like symptoms. Laparotomy revealed a ruptured conglomerate tumor in the lower abdomen associated with extensive peritoneal adhesions. Histology showed a spindle cell gastrointestinal stromal tumor with prominent sclerosis and calcification without low mitotic activity. The tumor cells expressed strongly CD117 and CD34. The mutation analysis revealed a heterozygous deletion/insertion involving exon 11 of KIT (pK558_V559delNNins). Because the tumor was ruptured intraoperatively, a high risk was assigned according to the revised National Institute of Health criteria and adjuvant therapy with imatinib mesylate was recommended. The patient is currently alive without evidence of progression 27 months after surgery.","title":"A novel complex KIT mutation in a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the vermiform appendix.","pubmedId":"23084635"}
