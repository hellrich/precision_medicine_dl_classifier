Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) CNA however, was expected to show normal variations in cancer patients as well as healthy individuals, and has thus been used as normal control DNA samples in various published studies. We performed array CGH to measure and compare genetic changes in terms of the CNA of PBMC samples as well as DNA isolated from tumor tissue samples, obtained from 24 non-small cell lung cancer patients. Contradictory to expectations, our studies showed that the PBMC CNA also showed chromosomal variant regions. The list included well-known tumor-associated NTRK1, FGF8, TP53, and TGFbeta1 genes and potentially novel oncogenes such as THPO (3q27.1), JMJD1B, and EGR1 (5q31.2), which was investigated in this study. The results of this study highlighted the connection between PBMC and tumor cell genomic DNA in lung cancer patients. However, the application of these studies to cancer prognosis may pose a challenge due to the large amount of information contained in genetic predisposition and family history that has to be processed for useful downstream clinical applications.","title":"DNA profiling by array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tumor tissue cell in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","pubmedId":"18975135"}
