Our aim was to assess whether             IDH mutations are common in Chinese glioma patients and whether the mutations             predict good response to concomitant chemoradiotherapy. In this study IDH1 and             IDH2 mutations were detected in a series of 203 gliomas. IDH1 mutations were present             in 75 of the 203 cases (36.9%) while IDH2 mutations in 5 of the 203 cases (2.5%).             No tumor was mutated in both IDH1 and IDH2. IDH1/2 mutations were associated with             prolonged overall survival in the whole series of patients exclusive of pilocytic             astrocytoma (P\u003c0.001), WHO grade Ⅱ patients who received no adjuvant therapy             after surgery (P\u003d0.014) and WHO grade Ⅲ patients who received concomitant chemoradiotherapy             (standard schedule) after surgery (P\u003d0.033). Furthermore, there was no correlation             between IDH1/2 mutations and reponse to concomitant chemoradiotherapy in anaplastic             gliomas. Our results suggest that IDH1 mutations also occur freuqently in Chinese             glioma patients but the frequency of IDH1 mutations is below the findings reported             by North American and European groups. Furthermore, we confirm the prognostic             significance of IDH1/2 mutations in gliomas, but the mutations cannot predict             a favorable response to concomitant chemoradiotherapy in anaplastic gliomas.","title":"IDH mutations occur frequently in Chinese glioma patients and predict             longer survival but not response to concomitant chemoradiotherapy in anaplastic             gliomas.","pubmedId":"21874255"}
