With the introduction of these drugs considerable improvements in both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were achieved. However these antibodies are associated with a unique side effect profile.\nThis review provides an overview about drug efficacy of bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab and ramucirumab in the treatment algorithm of mCRC. Additionally, we discuss the most common toxicites of these monoclonal antibodies.\nThe most common toxicities associated with the VEGF-A directed antibody bevacizumab are hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolism, bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation and prolonged wound healing. Similarly, the rate of hypertension and proteinuria is increased during treatment with the VEGFR2 antibody ramucirumab. On the other hand the most frequent side effects of EGFR targeted antibodies are skin rash, hypersensitivity reactions and hypomagnesemia. Due to the murine portions of cetuximab the incidence of infusion reactions is more frequent compared to panitumumab which is a pure human monoclonal antibody.","title":"The safety of monoclonal antibodies for treatment of colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"26982510"}
