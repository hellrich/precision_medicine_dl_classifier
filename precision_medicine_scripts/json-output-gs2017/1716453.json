Saporin titration experiments revealed that BsAb increased the toxicity of saporin 435-fold for HSB-2 cells, reducing the IC50 for saporin alone from 0.1 mumol to 0.23 nmol when BsAb was included. The rate of protein synthesis inactivation brought about by BsAb-mediated toxin delivery to HSB-2 cells was very similar to that described for conventional immunotoxins (IT\u0027s) with a t10 (time taken for a one log inhibition of protein synthesis compared with controls) of 46 h obtained at a saporin concentration of 1 nmol and 226 h at 0.1 nmol. BsAb titration studies demonstrated a clear dose response effect of BsAb concentration on target cell protein synthesis inhibition and cell proliferation. The absolute specificity of toxin delivery was unequivocally demonstrated by a failure of BsAb to deliver an effective dose of saporin to the CD7- cell line HL60 and by the blocking of BsAb-mediated delivery of saporin to HSB-2 cells with an excess of F(ab)2 fragments of the anti-CD7 antibody, HB2. These studies have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of this BsAb for delivering saporin to a T-ALL cell line utilising CD7 as the target molecule on the cell surface. BsAb\u0027s would therefore appear to offer a realistic alternative to IT\u0027s for toxin delivery to tumour cells and may even offer certain advantages over conventional IT\u0027s for clinical use.","title":"Characteristics and performance of a bispecific F (ab\u0027gamma)2 antibody for delivering saporin to a CD7+ human acute T-cell leukaemia cell line.","pubmedId":"1716453"}
