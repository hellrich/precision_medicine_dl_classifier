Its distinct alterations, as compared with non-Ov-related CCA may help shed light on its underlying molecular mechanisms.\nRecent whole-exome and targeted sequencing not only confirmed frequent mutations in known CCA-related genes including TP53 (44%), KRAS (16.7%) and SMAD4 (16.7%), but also revealed mutations in novel CCA-related genes associated with chromatin remodeling [BAP1 (2.8%), ARID1A (17.6%), MLL3 (13%) and IDH1/2 (2.8%)], WNT signaling [RNF43 (9.3%) and PEG3 (5.6%)] and KRAS/G protein signaling [GNAS (9.3%) and ROBO2 (9.3%)]. Interestingly, there is a significant difference in the frequency of mutated genes between Ov-related CCA and non-Ov-related CCA, such as p53 and IDH1/2, reflecting the impact of cause on pathogenesis. Altered DNA methylation and transcriptional profiles associated with xenobiotic metabolism and pro-inflammatory responses were also found in Ov-related CCA.\nLiver fluke-induced chronic inflammation plays a crucial role in cholangiocarcinogenesis, resulting in distinct signatures of genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional alterations. These alterations, when contrasted with non-Ov-related CCA, indicate a unique pathogenic process in Ov-related CCA and may have potential clinical implications on diagnostics, therapeutics and prevention.","title":"Genetics of Opisthorchis viverrini-related cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25693006"}
