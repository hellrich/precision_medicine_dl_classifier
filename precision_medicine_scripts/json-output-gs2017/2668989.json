Recent research has resulted in significant progress in the areas of diagnosis, epidemiology, family pathology, pharmacokinetics and psychopharmacology. Many rating instruments have been developed to screen, diagnose and measure changes of depression in children and adolescents. The prevalence of depressive disorders in prepubertal children is about 2% and in adolescents about 5%. Depressive episodes are usually of long duration, with high rates of relapse. These relapses are usually associated with school, family and social failure. Follow-up studies of depressed adolescents indicated that about half of the patients continue to suffer from mood disturbances and psycho-social adaptational problems. In North America suicidal behaviour in adolescents has increased 300% in the past 30 years. However, its relationship to depression is more complex than in adults. There is a significant excess of affective illness and alcoholism in the families of depressed adolescents. Similarly, there is a high rate of impairment among children of parents with affective disorders. During depressive episodes, prepubertal children show abnormalities of growth hormone and cortisol secretion. However, DST findings are contradictory. Polysomnographic findings in childhood depression appear unremarkable. In adolescent depression these findings are similar to those in depressed adults. Biological manifestations of depressive disorders may be significantly affected by developmental and hormonal changes. Antidepressants have been effective in the therapy of several disorders in childhood. These include enuresis, school phobias, attention deficit, conduct disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Open drug studies suggest that antidepressants are useful in depressed children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Depressive disorders in children and adolescents.","pubmedId":"2668989"}
