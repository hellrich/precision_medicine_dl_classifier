MTT assay was used to determine the growth rate of the gastric cancer cells. Activation of autophagy was monitored with monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining after adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP and control adenovirus NC-RNAi-GFP treatment. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using the fluorescent probe JC-1. The expression of autophagy was monitored with MDC, LC3 staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Western blotting was used to detect p53, Beclin-1, Bcl-2, and LC3 protein expression in the culture supernatant.\nThe viability of gastric cancer cells was inhibited after siRNA targeting to the Class I PI3K blocked Class I PI3K signal pathway. MTT assays revealed that, after SGC7901 cancer cells were treated with adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP, the rate of inhibition reached 27.48% ± 2.71% at 24 h, 41.92% ± 2.02% at 48 h, and 50.85% ± 0.91% at 72 h. After MGC803 cancer cells were treated with adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP, the rate of inhibition reached 24.39% ± 0.93% at 24 h, 47.00% ± 0.87% at 48 h, and 70.30% ± 0.86% at 72 h (P \u003c 0.05 compared to control group). It was determined that when 50 MOI, the transfection efficiency was 95% ± 2.4%. Adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP (50 MOI) induced mitochondrial dysfunction and activated cell apoptosis in SGC7901 cells, and the results described here prove that RNAi of Class I PI3K induced apoptosis in SGC7901 cells. The results showed that adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP transfection induced punctate distribution of LC3 immunoreactivity, indicating increased formation of autophagosomes. The results showed that the basal level of Beclin-1 and LC3 protein in SGC7901 cells was low. After incubating with adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP (50 MOI), Beclin-1, LC3, and p53 protein expression was significantly increased from 24 to 72 h. We also found that Bcl-2 protein expression down-regulated with the treatment of adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP (50 MOI). A number of isolated membranes, possibly derived from ribosome-free endoplasmic reticulum, were seen. These isolated membranes were elongated and curved to engulf a cytoplasmic fraction and organelles. We used transmission electron microscopy to identify ultrastructural changes in SGC7901 cells after adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP (50 MOI) treatment. Control cells showed a round shape and contained normal-looking organelles, nucleus, and chromatin, while adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP (50 MOI)-treated cells exhibited the typical signs of autophagy.\nAfter the Class I PI3K signaling pathway has been blocked by siRNA, the proliferation of cells was inhibited and the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells was enhanced.","title":"Effects of small interfering RNA inhibit Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase on human gastric cancer cells.","pubmedId":"23555164"}
