Mosaic NF2 may be the cause of about 8% of multiple meningiomas in sporadic adult cases, but there are other causes in the majority of other such patients and in multiple meningioma in families.","title":"Multiple meningiomas: differential involvement of the NF2 gene in children and adults.","pubmedId":"15635074"}
