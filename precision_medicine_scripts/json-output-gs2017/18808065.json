They are generally benign, but can progress to malignancy. The aim of our study was to determine the expression of 4 genes, c-Myc, neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), somatostatin receptor isoform 2 (sst2) and erb-B2, that have been associated with tumorogenesis or, possibly, with aggressive behavior or recurrence of meningiomas. We measured levels of mRNAs coding for these genes by qRT-PCR in 51 cases and levels ofc-Myc protooncogene and sst2 protein by immunohistochemistry in 26 cases of meningiomas of various grades and histotypes. C-Myc mRNA and protein levels were not grade-related, but validated subdivision of the 36 benign meningiomas into two groups, Groups IA and IB, based on histological and clinical features (Ki-67-proliferative index, absence or presence of mitoses, rate of recurrence and incidence of perilesional edema). In addition to histopathological grading, c-Myc expression may be useful in predicting tumor recurrence in patients with low-grade meningiomas. NF2 mRNA levels and sst2 mRNA and receptor levels were not grade-related, but were histotype-related, with significantly higher levels in the meningothelial subtype than in the fibroblastic subtype. Erb-B2 mRNA levels were not grade- or histotype-related. Furthermore, the high expression of sst2 in meningothelial meningioma suggests the possibility of a different tumorigenesis process in this meningioma subtype and may open perspectives for the diagnosis and therapy of this subtype using somatostatin as an antiproliferative agent.","title":"Expression of c-Myc, neurofibromatosis Type 2, somatostatin receptor 2 and erb-B2 in human meningiomas: relation to grades or histotypes.","pubmedId":"18808065"}
