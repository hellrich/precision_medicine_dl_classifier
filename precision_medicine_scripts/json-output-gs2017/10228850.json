We investigated the clinicopathological and biological features of ductal adenocarcinoma limited to the pancreas without direct histological extrapancreatic invasion (t1 tumor).\nThe clinical records of 86 patients who underwent surgery for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were reviewed to determine clinical features, histopathological findings, operative management and outcomes. Immunohistochemical staining of the p53 tumor suppressor gene (p53) was performed for the resected specimens.\nOnly 10 (12%) of the 86 resected ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas were t1 tumors. Six of the 10 patients with t1 tumors survived for more than 5 years. The rates of nodal metastasis (10%) and neural plexus invasion (0%) in t1 tumors were significantly lower than those in non-t1 tumors, although the rates of blood-borne metastasis (30%) and p53 expression (50%) in t1 tumors were the same as those in non-t1 tumors.\nCurative resection contributes to a satisfactory long-term prognosis of patients with t1 tumor of the pancreas as a result of the low rates of both nodal metastasis and neural plexus invasion associated with this procedure. In patients with t1 tumor of the pancreas, a satisfactory long-term prognosis can be assured as a result of the low rates of both nodal metastasis and neural plexus invasion associated with curative resection.","title":"Clinical and biological features of t1 ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"10228850"}
