Circulogene Theranostics has developed a CLIA-certified proprietary method enabling the recovery of necrosis and apoptosis-associated, cell-free (cf)-DNA, with a high-yield ( \u003e 300 ng/ml) of sequencing quality DNA from a drop of plasma. We report cfDNA sequencing data from mCRPC patients (pts) using this novel methodology. Methods: Pts with mCRPC underwent prospective blood collection at UAB. Twenty microliters of plasma collected in a microtainer EDTA tube was used for the harvesting of cfDNA. An automated workstation that can process up to 96 samples facilitates consistent and reliable studies with a turnaround time of 7-10 days. DNA is subjected to targeted ultra-deep (2,000X  15,000X) Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on the Ion Torrent platform to detect approximately 3000 hotspot mutations in 50 potentially actionable genes. Germline and unconfirmed/silent somatic mutations and mutations with allele frequency \u003c 1% are filtered out based on dbSNP, 1000 genomes and COSMIC. Results: Plasma samples were available from 27 patients with mCRPC. A median of 840 ng (range 280-1640) of DNA was recovered from 20 L of plasma per patient. The most common mutation at baseline was in the P53 gene, seen in 7 pts (25.9%), followed by KIT in 3 pts (11.1%) and VEGFR2 in 2 pts (7.4%). Mutations seen in 1 patient each (3.7%) were ALK, CTNNB1, EGFR, ERBB4, FGFR3, HNF1A, HRAS, IDH1, JAK3, KRAS, NOTCH1, PIK3CA, PTEN, PTPN11, RET, SMAD4 and VHL. Activating mutations were seen in ALK, HRAS, IDH1, JAK3 and VEGFR2, and inactivating mutations were seen in P53, PTEN and VHL. The dataset is expanding and results will be updated from a larger number of pts. Conclusions: Multiple potentially actionable therapeutic targets were identified by cfDNA sequencing of pts with mCRPC. This novel methodology facilitates the yield of large quantities of high fidelity DNA from minimal quantities of plasma, and appears promising to serially and non-invasively profile tumor DNA and inform on clonal evolution in a time and cost-efficient manner.","title":"Circulating cell-free DNA profiling for potentially actionable targets in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) using next-generation sequencing on droplet volumes of plasma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_166835-176"}
