Melanin-induced nail pigmentations are recommended to be treated by a resection in local anaemia of the dorsal two thirds of the terminal phalanx. This procedure combines sufficient radical surgery with a good functional and acceptable cosmetic result.","title":"[Subungual melanoma with linear nail pigmentation].","pubmedId":"681177"}
