Using single-agent gemcitabine has been the standard treatment for more than 15 years for advanced pancreatic cancer. The attempts at improving the results by combining it with several other drugs, such as fluorouracil, cisplatin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, or pemetrexed produced no clear survival benefit. Recently, however, new combination chemotherapy regimens (e.g., FOLFIRINOX, nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine) achieved a significant survival benefit compared to gemcitabine alone.\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transmembrane glycoprotein has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, and it correlates with more advanced disease, poor survival, and the presence of metastases. Therefore, inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway could be an attractive therapeutic target in this tumor. Although several combinations of EGFR inhibitors with chemotherapy demonstrate inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis, tumor cell apoptosis, and regression in xenograft models, these benefits remain to be confirmed.\nThe encouraging results from preclinical and early clinical studies with cetuximab in pancreatic cancer were not confirmed in a Phase III trial. Cetuximab failed to demonstrate improved patient outcome when paired with various chemotherapeutic regimens and/or other biological agents.","title":"Cetuximab: still an option in the treatment of pancreatic cancer?","pubmedId":"23560505"}
