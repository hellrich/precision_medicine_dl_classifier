Results of an ocular examination, computed tomography scan, and pathological findings of space-occupied orbital and nasosinus lesions are presented.\nComputed tomography scan revealed a high-density soft tissue mass occupying the right superionasal orbit extending into the frontal and ethmoidal sinuses and bilateral acoustic schwannomas in the brain. Biopsy of the right orbital lesion demonstrated a typical meningioma as indicated with routine hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical evaluation.\nIn this patient, an extracranial orbital meningioma, rather than optic nerve sheath meningioma extending into nasosinus, designates a diagnosis of NF2. Ophthalmologists should be aware of the possibility that patients with an extracranial orbital meningioma may also have NF2.","title":"Extracranial orbital meningioma extending into the nasosinus in neurofibromatosis type 2.","pubmedId":"24448521"}
