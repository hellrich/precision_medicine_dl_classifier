Analyses were conducted to evaluate hypotheses which proposed that recurrent depression would be significantly associated with the three medical outcomes, but not single episode MDD.\nAfter controlling for a range of important covariates (e.g., BMI, smoking, alcohol use), cross-sectional analyses indicated that recurrent MDD, but not single episode MDD, significantly predicted CVD risk and diabetes. Prospective analyses indicated that recurrent MDD, but not single episode MDD, increased the risk for CVD and diabetes.\nThe sample was a predominantly white, middle-class sample so generalizability of findings may be limited for minorities and men. Reliance on self-report data may have biased the findings.\nThese findings suggest the benefits of measuring single versus recurrent MDD when investigating the risk of depression on chronic diseases. Findings also suggest the importance of identifying individuals suffering from recurrent MDD early in their lifespan with the goal of preventing future depressive episodes.","title":"Recurrent depression, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes among middle-aged and older adult women.","pubmedId":"23721922"}
