Oviducts were collected from apparently healthy buffalo genital tracts (nonluteal and luteal stage of estrous cycle) and separated into isthmus and ampulla. Each segment of oviduct (nonluteal and luteal) was flushed with PBS (pH 7.4). The flushing obtained was centrifuged (3000 rpm; 30 min), filtered (0.2 microm) and frozen at -20 degrees C. The proteins in pooled nonluteal isthmic and ampullary and luteal isthmic and ampullary fluids were precipitated overnight using ammonium sulphate, centrifuged (10000 rpm; 30 min) and dialyzed (\u003e10 kDa). After protein estimation, aliquots of samples containing 10 mg proteins were lyophilized in cryovials and stored in frozen form at -20 degrees C. Six pooled good-quality ejaculates collected by artificial vagina method from two Murrah buffalo bulls were utilized for the study. After fresh semen analysis, each pooled ejaculate was splited into five parts and extended in Tris-egg yolk-citrate extender (20% egg yolk; 7% glycerol), so that final dilution yielded approximately 60 million sperm cells per ml, and cryopreserved in 0.5 ml French straws (30 million sperm cells/straw) in LN(2) (-196 degrees C). Before freezing, nonluteal isthmic and ampullary and luteal isthmic and ampullary proteins were incorporated at the rate of 1mg/ml of extended semen. The equilibrated and frozen-thawed (37 degrees C for 30 s) semen was evaluated for motility, live %, acrosomal integrity percentage, bovine cervical mucus penetration test and hypo-osmotic sperm swelling test. Besides this, spermatozoa from treatment and control groups were incubated at 37 degrees C for 6 h in sperm TALP. Among the nonluteal and luteal oviductal proteins, the former maintained higher (P \u003c 0.05) post-thaw sperm motility, live %, and acrosomal integrity than the control group. Between the isthmic and ampullary proteins, the isthmic proteins incorporated group maintained higher (P \u003c 0.05) post-thaw sperm motility, live %, and acrosomal integrity. Similarly, higher sperm penetration distance in cervical mucus was recorded in nonluteal isthmic proteins incorporated group. But, irrespective of the stage of an estrous cycle, isthmic proteins included group maintains higher sperm membrane integrity as revealed by higher (P \u003c 0.05) swollen sperm percentage in response to hypo-osmotic solution than the ampullary proteins included and control groups. Similarly, at any time during incubation the sperm motility and viability was higher (P \u003c 0.05) in isthmic proteins treated group than the ampullary and control group. But, the same trend was not observed in terms of acrosomal integrity percentages. It is inferred that inclusion of oviductal proteins in the extender prior to freezing improved post-thaw semen quality. Oviductal proteins differentially affected sperm function depending upon the region of oviduct and the stage of estrous cycle at which the proteins were obtained.","title":"Modulation of post-thaw sperm functions with oviductal proteins in buffaloes.","pubmedId":"15950408"}
