This timely review seeks to summarize these recent advances which will provide a foundation for future studies in the field.\nStereotypical genetic alterations have been identified and confirmed. However, additional alterations have highlighted the importance and complexity of a number of intracellular signaling pathways that present unique opportunities for therapeutic targeting.\nA genetic signature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has been identified. This recent and important work is currently in the process of being applied in many clinical applications from early diagnostics to customized therapeutic regimens for this disease. A fundamental understanding of these findings will thus be of utmost importance for future research in the field and in the clinical care of patients with this lethal disease.","title":"Molecular biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25023382"}
