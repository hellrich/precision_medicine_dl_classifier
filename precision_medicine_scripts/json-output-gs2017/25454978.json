Inflammation in vivo can be mediated by 5-lipoxygenase (5LO), an enzyme that converts omega-6 fatty acids (FA) to eicosanoids, including leukotriene B4 (LTB4). We have previously shown that diets rich in omega-6 FA increase pancreatic lesions and mast cell infiltration in EL-Kras mice. In this study, we evaluated the role of 5LO in generating higher levels of LTB4 from human cells and in mediating lesion development and mast cell infiltration in EL-Kras mice.\nHuman pancreatic ductal epithelial and cancer cells were treated with omega-6 FA in vitro. EL-Kras mice lacking 5LO (EL-Kras/5LO(-/-)) mice were generated and fed standard chow or omega-6 FA diets. Pancreatic lesion frequency and mast cell infiltration were compared with EL-Kras/5LO(+/+) mice. Human PDAC tumors were evaluated for 5LO expression and mast cells.\nHuman pancreatic ductal epithelial and pancreatic cancer cells treated with omega-6 FA generated increased LTB4 levels in vitro. EL-Kras/5LO(-/-) mice developed fewer pancreatic lesions and had decreased mast cell infiltration when compared with EL-Kras/5LO(+/+) mice. Human PDAC tumors with increased 5LO expression demonstrate increased mast cell infiltration. Additionally, diets rich in omega-6 FA failed to increase pancreatic lesion development and mast cell infiltration in EL-Kras/5LO(-/-) mice.\nThe expansion of mutant Kras-induced lesions via omega-6 FA is dependent on 5LO, and 5LO functions downstream of mutant Kras to mediate inflammation, suggesting that 5LO may be a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.","title":"Ablation of 5-lipoxygenase mitigates pancreatic lesion development.","pubmedId":"25454978"}
