Previous studies in animal models have shown that oncogenic NRAS is unable to induce myeloid malignancies effectively, and it was suggested that oncogenic NRAS might only act as a secondary mutation in leukemogenesis. In this study, we examined the leukemogenicity of NRAS using an improved mouse bone marrow transduction and transplantation model. We found that oncogenic NRAS rapidly and efficiently induced chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)- or acute myeloid leukemia (AML)- like disease in mice, indicating that mutated NRAS can function as an initiating oncogene in the induction of myeloid malignancies. In addition to CMML and AML, we found that NRAS induced mastocytosis in mice. This result indicates that activation of the RAS pathway also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mastocytosis. The mouse model for NRAS leukemogenesis established here provides a system for further studying the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies and for testing relevant therapies.","title":"Oncogenic NRAS rapidly and efficiently induces CMML- and AML-like diseases in mice.","pubmedId":"16763213"}
