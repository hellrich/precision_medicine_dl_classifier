The tool covers the risk factors for cervical cancer, the American Cancer Society (ACS) cervical cancer screening guidelines, and the invasive cervical cancer incidence rate in the Hispanic population.\nProfessional journals and books; ACS and National Cancer Institute literature.\nScientific evidence strongly suggests that cervical cancer mortality descreases with regular Pap test screening for sexually active women or those who have reached age 18. Many Hispanic women, however, do not know about the importance of Pap testing. WHL was developed to meet this learning need.\nAfter attending the educational program, 87% of the respondents achieved the learning objectives.\nThis educational program can be used to educate Hispanic women about cervical cancer. The content and principles also can be applied to other groups of women.","title":"Women\u0027s Health Lotería: a new cervical cancer education tool for Hispanic females.","pubmedId":"7675672"}
