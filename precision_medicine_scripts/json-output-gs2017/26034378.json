Although GISTs can spread to the liver and peritoneum, metastasis to the skeletal muscle is very rare and only four cases have previously been reported. These cases involved concurrent skeletal metastases of primary GISTs or liver metastases. Here, we report the first case of a distant recurrence in the brachialis muscle after complete remission of an extra-luminal gastric GIST following a wedge resection of the stomach, omental excision, and adjuvant imatinib therapy for one year. Ten months after therapy completion, the patient presented with swelling and tenderness in the left arm. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large mass in the brachialis muscle, which showed positivity for c-kit and CD34 upon pathologic examination. This is the first reported case of a solitary distant recurrence of a GIST in the muscle after complete remission had been achieved.
