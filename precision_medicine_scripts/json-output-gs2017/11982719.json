Besides the clinicopathological factors such as tumor characteristics, sex, and age, background liver disease is a major determinant of prognosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma, mainly associated with chemical carcinogens such as aflatoxin, does not have severe background cirrhosis, and grows quickly, whereas HCC developing in association with a virus in a cirrhotic liver generally grows more slowly, and the severity of cirrhosis is the major prognostic factor. The median survival of untreated sub-Saharan African patients is less than 1 month from diagnosis, contrasted by an average survival of 4 months in virus-induced HCC associated with cirrhosis. Tumor characteristics, such as size, number, and growth speed, which vary considerably from case to case, affect the prognosis. Vascular (portal) invasion portends a poor prognosis, and alpha-fetoprotein levels also correlate with prognosis. Several distinct clinical types of HCC occur, namely diffuse-type HCC caused by rapid portal spread of cancer cells, febrile-type caused by poorly differentiated sarcomatoid cancer cells, and cholestatic HCC caused by intraductal invasion; all have a short survival. There are several histological variant forms: combined hepato-cholangiocarcinoma behaves like HCC, with a poorer prognosis because of more frequent lymph node metastases; fibromellar carcinoma, which is relatively common in young Caucasian adults, has a good prognosis if diagnosed early, permitting resection; and cholangiolocellular carcinoma, which derives from the canalicular epithelium, is indistinguishable from HCC, with a similar prognosis.","title":"Natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma including fibrolamellar and hepato-cholangiocarcinoma variants.","pubmedId":"11982719"}
