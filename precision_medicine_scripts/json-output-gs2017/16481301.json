In this study we constructed tissue microarray containing specimens from pancreatic cancer, adjacent non-cancer tissue and normal tissue to survey the expression of p53, p16 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).\nTissue microarray containing 337 specimens from different stages of pancreatic cancer, adjacent non-cancer tissue and normal tissues was constructed, and the expression of p53, p16 and COX-2 was assayed by immunohistochemistry to consecutive formalin-fixed tissue microarray sections.\nThe expression of p53, p16 and COX-2 was significantly higher in tumorous tissues than in non-tumorous ones. A significant relationship was observed between p53 and COX-2, or p16 and COX-2. But no obvious correlation was seen between p53 and p16 expressions. Logistic regression analysis showed p53 and COX-2 as dependent predictors in pancreatic carcinogenesis, and a reciprocal relationship to neoplastic progression between p53 and COX-2.\nCombination analysis of p53 and COX-2 may be useful in predicting pancreatic carcinogenesis.","title":"Expression of p53, p16 and COX-2 in pancreatic cancer with tissue microarray.","pubmedId":"16481301"}
