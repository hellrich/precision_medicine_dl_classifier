Primary malignancies are located in the abdomen or pelvis. Patients with SMJN have a poor prognosis. An 83-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 1-month history of a rapidly enlarging umbilical mass. Endoscopic findings revealed advanced transverse colon cancer. computer tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography revealed tumors of the transverse colon, umbilicus, right inguinal lymph nodes, and left lung. The feeding arteries and drainage veins for the SMJN were the inferior epigastric vessels. Imaging findings of the left lung tumor allowed for identification of the primary lung cancer, and a diagnosis of advanced transverse colon cancer with SMJN and primary lung cancer was made. The patient underwent local resection of the SMNJ and subsequent single-site laparoscopic surgery involving right hemicolectomy and paracolic lymph node dissection. Intra-abdominal dissemination to the mesocolon was confirmed during surgery. Histopathologically, the transverse colon cancer was confirmed to be moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. We suspect that SMJN may occur via a hematogenous pathway. Although chemotherapy for colon cancer and thoracoscopic surgery for the primary lung cancer were scheduled, the patient and her family desired home hospice. Seven months after surgery, she died of rapidly growing lung cancer.
