Mutation of the KRAS gene is one of the most important events in carcinogenesis of the lung. The KRAS gene, belonging to the RAS gene family, encodes a membrane-bound 21-kd guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein. Single point mutations in this protein result in continuous activation to transmit excessive signals, promoting a variety of biological events. In lung cancers, the mutations concentrate at codon 12 and mostly affect adenocarcinomas (ADCs). They also affect atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, the precursor of ADCs. Therefore, mutation of the KRAS gene is suggested to confer a growth advantage to airway epithelial cells enabling them to expand clonally early in the development of ADCs. The mutation is also a reliable marker of an unfavorable response to certain molecular-targeting therapies. Furthermore, patients with ADCs affected by mutations have been reported to exhibit a significantly higher risk of postoperative disease recurrence. Thus, the significance of KRAS gene mutations has been investigated extensively. However, not all the details emerged. In this review, particulars that have been established are introduced, and important issues remaining to be resolved are discussed, with special reference to carcinogenesis of the lung.","title":"KRAS gene mutations in lung cancer: particulars established and issues unresolved.","pubmedId":"20846262"}
