Thus, the hTERT promoter has been extensively used in targeted cancer gene therapy. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) matrix protein (MP) induces the apoptosis of tumor cells in the absence of other viral components. In our previous studies, we successfully constructed the pVAX-M plasmid from the pVAX plasmid, which expressed wild-type VSV MP (VSV MP is under the control of the CMV promoter) and demonstrated that pVAX-M efficiently suppresses the growth of malignant tumors via the induction of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The present study was designed to construct the plasmid phTERTM (VSV MP is under the control of the hTERT promoter) and investigate whether it had a targeted antitumor effect in nude mice bearing human lung adenocarcinoma. In vitro, A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells were treated with NS, Lip-null, etoposide, Lip-pVAX-M or Lip-phTERT-M, and examined for cell viability through MTT assays or for apoptosis by flow cytometry and TUNEL assays. In vivo, A549 human lung carcinoma models in nude mice were established. Mice were treated with 10 4-weekly intravenous administrations of NS, Lip-null, etoposide (2 mg/kg), Lip-pVAX-M or Lip-phTERT-M. Subsequently, Lip-phTERT-M was found to be the most efficient inhibitor of tumor growth and inducer of tumor cell apoptosis when compared with the other groups in vivo and in vitro (P\u003c0.05). Notably, immunohistochemical staining showed that Lip-phTERT-M significantly limited the overexpression of VSV MP to the tumor tissues and reduced VSV MP expression in other organs in comparison with Lip-pVAX-M (P\u003c0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that phTERT-M demonstrates a targeted antitumor effect on A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. These observations suggest that phTERT-M gene therapy may be a novel and potent strategy for targeting human lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Gene therapy using the human telomerase catalytic subunit gene promoter enables targeting of the therapeutic effects of vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein against human lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23226739"}
