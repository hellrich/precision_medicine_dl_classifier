This is of particular importance in lung cancer, where a third of patients may have insufficient biopsies for molecular analyses and may be ineligible for approved targeted therapies. However, the fraction of ctDNA obtained from a blood sample is often low ( \u003c 1.0%) and can be difficult to detect with current approaches. Additionally, most methods to detect ctDNA interrogate single hot spot mutations or a few genetic alterations.   Methods:   To overcome these issues, we developed comprehensive ctDNA approaches to detect somatic sequence mutations, translocations, and amplifications at low allele frequencies in the circulation of cancer patients. These analyses span 63 well-established cancer genes, including BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, PI3KCA,FGFR,KRAS and NRAS, translocations in ALK, EGFR, NTRK1,RET and ROS1, and amplification of MET and ERBB2. This comprehensive panel covers many recognized resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies and provides a method to understand patterns of intrinsic and acquired resistance in oncogene defined lung cancer. To evaluate this approach, we performed dilution series using tumor-derived DNA, containing well-characterized somatic mutations, in the presence of wild-type DNA in 3-5ml of plasma from 90 patients with late-stage lung cancer.   Results:   We were able to detect sequence alterations at levels of \u003e 0.01% with a specificity of \u003e 99.9%. Further analyses demonstrated high concordance between the somatic sequence mutations and translocations identified in the tumor sample and those identified in the plasma, including alterations in driver genes as well as those related to acquired resistance to targeted therapies. 70 patients had serial samples, and within this cohort, we demonstrated evolution of resistance clones that predict radiographic increases in tumor burden.   Conclusions:  These analyses provide a non-invasive platform to enable liquid biopsy detection of clinically relevant genetic alterations across a large number of genomic loci in lung cancer patients.","title":"A non-invasive liquid biopsy approach for therapeutic stratification of lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_152938-156"}
