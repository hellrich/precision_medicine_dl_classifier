Patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified. Next-generation sequencing was performed from paraffin-tumor blocks. Mutational profiles were reviewed to determine available targeted therapies and clinical trial eligibility.\nThirty patients were identified. The incidence of mutations was: Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolong (KRAS) \u003d 87%, tumor protein 53 (TP53) \u003d 63%, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) \u003d 20%, Mothers Against Decapentaplegic Homolog 4 (SMAD4) \u003d 20%, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) \u003d 7%. Multiple mutations were found in 73%. All CDKN2A mutations occurred in male patients (P \u003d .06), and there was a trend toward younger patient age in this group (P \u003d .13). Potential for Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved targeted therapies was identified in 8 of 30 (27%). In addition, 29 of 30 (97%) had mutations applicable for ongoing phase I or II clinical trials.\nNext-generation sequencing of resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens can determine common genetic mutations and identify patients who may be eligible for off-label use of targeted therapies or clinical trial enrollment.","title":"Using next-generation sequencing to determine potential molecularly guided therapy options for patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26754455"}
