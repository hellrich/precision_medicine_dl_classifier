This review indicates that (a) predictable risk factors exist for depression among men with prostate cancer, (b) different prostate cancer treatments do not tend to be associated with differential outcomes in depression or mood, and (c) overall, men with prostate cancer report fewer depressive symptoms than women with breast cancer.\nThe small body of research addressing depression in men with prostate cancer is methodologically inadequate to estimate the overall prevalence of depression among men with prostate cancer and determine the clinical significance of psychoeducational interventions targeting depression or mood in this population.\nNurses can use current knowledge to identify men with prostate cancer who are most at risk for depression. Evidence supporting the benefit of psychoeducational interventions for depression in other cancer populations (e.g., women with breast cancer) may be applicable to men with prostate cancer.","title":"Depression in men with prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"15897931"}
