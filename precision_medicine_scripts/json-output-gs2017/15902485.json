Immunohistochemical c-erbB2 expression and related clinico-pathological features were examined in 312 surgically resected patient tissues of NSCLCs, including 175 cases of adenocarcinoma and 137 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Immunostaining of inner- and ecto-domain of c-erbB2, mRNA expression and the quantitation of soluble c-erbB2 in cultured media were performed in five NSCLC cell lines. Cytoplasmic expression of c-erbB2 was observed more frequently than membranous, both in patient tissues and cell lines. Neither membranous nor cytoplasmic expression of c-erbB2 was significantly correlated with short outcome in NSCLCs. Membranous c-erbB2 was expressed by both inner and ecto-domain, while cytoplasmic c-erbB2 was expressed by either or both inner and ecto-domain. c-erbB2 mRNA was produced in most cell lines; however, the soluble form was only detectable in a cell line that only presented a membranous c-erbB2. In conclusion, cytoplasmic c-erbB2 of NSCLCs was not a full-length protein only expressed in cellular membrane, but reflected degenerated c-erbB2 fragments with less functional ability.","title":"Cytoplasmic expression of c-erbB2 in non-small cell lung cancers.","pubmedId":"15902485"}
