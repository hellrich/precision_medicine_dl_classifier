We present a 44-year-old woman with chordoid meningioma not associated with CS. The patient presented with epilepsy and right hemiparesis (Todd\u0027s palsy) on admission. The radiological findings revealed an extraaxial mass lesion in the premotor cortex. They were compatible with a preoperative diagnosis of meningioma. No physical abnormalities related to CS were detected. A left frontal craniotomy was performed. The tumor surface was gelatinous, and it was totally resected with the attached dura mater (Simpson grade I). The patient had an uneventful recovery, and her seizures subsided. The pathological findings of the specimens revealed nests and cords of spindle and epithelioid cells with abundant myxoid matrix, mimicking the features of chordoma. On the basis of radiological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic findings, chordoid meningioma was verified, and a review of the literature was performed.","title":"Chordoid meningioma.","pubmedId":"11310923"}
