The patient presented with abdominal pain and fever. An abdominal mass was identified that corresponded to a mixed-type high-grade mesenteric liposarcoma with wide areas of necrosis, areas of dedifferentiation and features of a leiomyosarcoma. Three months after the removal of the first mass, the patient underwent a second laparotomy, followed by treatment with doxorubicin and ifosfamide. Subsequently, the patient was started on therapy with trabectedin and a CR was noted following only four cycles of therapy. The best responses that are reported in the literature for cases of liposarcoma treated with trabectedin are mostly for liposarcomas of the myxoid/round cell type and are mainly partial responses. In the present study, trabectedin was used for the treatment of a mesenteric liposarcoma of mixed morphological features and a CR was achieved.","title":"Complete remission of a reccurrent mesenteric liposarcoma with rare histological features following the administration of trabectedin.","pubmedId":"24348818"}
