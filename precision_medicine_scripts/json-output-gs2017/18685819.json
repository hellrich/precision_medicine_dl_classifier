These patients were younger (P\u003c0.001) with lower ASA risk factors (P\u003c0.001) and earlier UICC tumor stages (P\u003c0.001) than open resected patients. They also showed reduced overall morbidity (P\u003c0.001), in-hospital mortality (P\u003d0.001), and shorter hospital stays (P\u003c0.001). The rates of intraoperative and specific complications remained unchanged. Nineteen percent of the patients had resections converted to open approaches. These had the highest overall morbidity and longest hospital stays. Their mortality was three times that of the group with complete laparoscopic resection.\nThe open approach remained the standard of surgical care in colon cancer for the study duration. Laparoscopic surgery was used in only a small number of patients. By virtue of preferential patient selection, better early postoperative and long-term results could be achieved for the laparoscopic group than with the open approach. Conversions were shown to be associated with inferior results at the high rate of 19%. To ensure optimal results, laparoscopic surgery for colon carcinoma should be conducted by an experienced surgeon in an appropriately selected patient pool.","title":"[Clinical value of laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer].","pubmedId":"18685819"}
