Of five sisters, two had an isolated meningioma and one an ependymoma. Amongst the four children of those affected there was a son with two cerebral meningiomas and a daughter with a spinal meningioma. Signs typical of von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) or bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis (NF2) were not present. The pattern is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with relatively high penetrance.","title":"Familial CNS tumors.","pubmedId":"1512611"}
