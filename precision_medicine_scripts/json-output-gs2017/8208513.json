For biological activity the gene product p21 ras needs to be bound to the cell membrane by a farnesyl residue. Treatment of tumor cells with lovastatin reduces the availability of farnesyl pyrophosphate for the modification of the ras proteins. The membrane localization of p21 ras has been reduced by 30-36% after the tumor cells have grown in the presence of 10 microM lovastatin for 7 days. The extent of the inhibition depends on the growth kinetics of the cell lines.","title":"Inhibition of the membrane localization of p21 ras proteins by lovastatin in tumor cells possessing a mutated N-ras gene.","pubmedId":"8208513"}
