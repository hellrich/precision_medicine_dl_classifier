However, only half of these patients will benefit from treatment, suggesting the need to identify additional biomarkers for cetuximab-based treatment efficacy.\nWe retrospectively collected tumors from 173 patients with mCRC. All but one patient received a cetuximab-based regimen as second-line or greater therapy. KRAS and BRAF status were assessed by allelic discrimination. EGFR amplification was assessed by chromogenic in situ hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization, and the expression of PTEN was assessed by immunochemistry.\nIn patients with KRAS wild-type tumors (n \u003d 116), BRAF mutations (n \u003d 5) were weakly associated with lack of response (P \u003d .063) but were strongly associated with shorter progression-free survival (P \u003c .001) and shorter overall survival (OS; P \u003c .001). A high EGFR polysomy or an EGFR amplification was found in 17.7% of the patients and was associated with response (P \u003d .015). PTEN null expression was found in 19.9% of the patients and was associated with shorter OS (P \u003d .013). In multivariate analysis, BRAF mutation and PTEN expression status were associated with OS.\nBRAF status, EGFR amplification, and cytoplasmic expression of PTEN were associated with outcome measures in KRAS wild-type patients treated with a cetuximab-based regimen. Subsequent studies in clinical trial cohorts will be required to confirm the clinical utility of these markers.","title":"Analysis of PTEN, BRAF, and EGFR status in determining benefit from cetuximab therapy in wild-type KRAS metastatic colon cancer.","pubmedId":"19884556"}
