Patients receiving a diagnosis of CNS tumor in the period 2000-2010 were included in the study if a computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study was available. Demographic data and patient characteristics and disease variables were retrieved.\nThe study comprised 251 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of treated CNS tumors was 5 per 100,000 per year. There was a peak incidence in the 41-50 age group and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.46. Of CNS tumors, 21% were gliomas, 26.7% were meningiomas, 4.7% were schwannomas, and 12.0% were pituitary adenomas. Suriname has a low glioma incidence compared with globally (40%-60% of CNS tumors globally). The incidence of pituitary adenoma was higher than expected. There are indications for a higher glioma and meningioma incidence in Javanese and a higher metastases incidence in Creoles.\nThe annual incidence of treated CNS tumors of 5 per 100,000 inhabitants in Suriname was in accordance with the expectation of an incidence of 3-6 per 100,000. Suriname is considered a country with a low cancer incidence. The differences found among various subgroups were too small to make definitive statements.","title":"Incidence and treatment of central nervous system tumors in Suriname.","pubmedId":"22480978"}
