We especially included the breast cancers with complete/incomplete membrane staining at moderate intensity in less than 10% of the invasive tumor cells. Of 1804 breast cases, 180 had moderate complete/incomplete membrane Her2 immunostaining. According to 2013 ASCO/CAP guideline, 124 were in IHC score 2+ and 56 in 1+ category. The percentage of Her2 immunostained invasive tumor cells were determined by visual estimation at the time of diagnosis and categorized into three groups; \u003c10%, 10-50%, and \u003e50% for this review. FISH was performed by dual DNA probe and data of Her2/cep17 ratio, Her2/cell and Cep17/cell were recorded applying 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria. There were 22 cases (12.2%) in \u003e50% group, 102 (56.7%) in 10-50% group, and 56 (31.1%) in \u003c10% group. Overall Her2 amplification was 25.5%. Her2 was amplified in 12 (54.5%) cases in \u003e50% group; 26 (25.4%) in 10-50% and 8 (14.3%) in \u003c10%. Her2 amplification was more frequent in cancers with \u003e50% moderately immunostained cells in IHC equivocal group. However, most of Her2 IHC equivocal breast cancers contain moderate amount (10-50%) of immunostained cells. Relatively small but non-neglectable number (14%) of cases in \u003c10% group was Her2 amplified by FISH which approaches to overall incidence of Her2 overexpression (15-20%) in all breast cancer. Breast cancers with moderate complete/incomplete membrane Her2 IHC staining in \u003c10% of invasive tumor cells should be regarded as equivocal and reflex FISH should be performed in these cases.
