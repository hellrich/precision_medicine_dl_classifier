It has been reported to express in various types of cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), astrocytic brain tumors, and glioblastomas. However, the relationship between BCCIP expression and clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be determined. Herein, we demonstrated that BCCIP was downregulated in clinical HCC tissues; its level was inversely correlated with multiple clinicopathological factors, such as tumor grade, tumor size, and Ki67 expression. Cox regression analysis of tumor samples revealed that BCCIP expression status was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients\u0027 poor survival. Our study also indicated that BCCIP shutdown reduces p21 expression and accelerates G1 to S progression of LO2 hepatocytes significantly. Moreover, there is an interaction between BCCIP and p53 in hepatic L02 cells, and the downregulation of p21 expression by BCCIP is in a p53-dependent way. These findings revealed that BCCIP may play a significant role for the determination of HCC progression through its role in regulating cell growth. Thus, our results suggest that BCCIP is of potential interest for prognostic marker and therapeutic target of HCC.","title":"Expression pattern of BCCIP in hepatocellular carcinoma is correlated with poor prognosis and enhanced cell proliferation.","pubmedId":"27832471"}
