We hypothesized that EGFR mutations may be related to residential radon or passive tobacco smoke.\nThis hypothesis was investigated by analyzing EGFR mutations in 70 lung tumors from a population of never and long-term former female smokers from Missouri with detailed exposure assessments. The relationship with passive smoking was also examined in never-smoking female lung cancer cases from the Mayo clinic.\nOverall, the frequency of EGFR mutation was 41% [95% confidence interval (CI), 32%-49%]. Neither radon nor passive-smoking exposure was consistently associated with EGFR mutations in lung tumors.\nThe results suggest that EGFR mutations are common in female, never-smoking lung cancer cases from the United States, and EGFR mutations are unlikely due to exposure to radon or passive smoking.","title":"EGFR somatic mutations in lung tumors: radon exposure and passive smoking in former- and never-smoking U.S. women.","pubmedId":"22523180"}
