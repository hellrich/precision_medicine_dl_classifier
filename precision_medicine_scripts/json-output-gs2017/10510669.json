HER-2/neu gene amplification and protein overexpression have been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary invasive breast cancer tissues from 135 women were tested for HER-2/neu gene amplification by automated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a sequence probe. The tumors also were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for proliferation markers Ki 67 (MIB1) and p34cdc2 cyclin-dependent kinase. Patients were followed up for a mean of 61 months. There were 70 node-negative and 65 node-positive cases. Ki 67 and p34cdc2 proliferation marker overexpression, HER-2/neu oncogene amplification, large tumor size, high tumor grade, advanced tumor stage, positive lymph node status, and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis predicted disease-related death in combined node-negative and node-positive breast cancer. HER-2/neu gene amplification, tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor grade, and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis independently predicted disease outcome. HER-2/neu amplification detected by FISH also predicted disease-related death independent of lymph node status, tumor grade, and distant metastasis in breast cancer patients who received adjuvant therapy.","title":"Prognostic significance of p34cdc2 cyclin-dependent kinase and MIB1 overexpression, and HER-2/neu gene amplification detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"10510669"}
