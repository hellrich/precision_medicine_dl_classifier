The TCC52 gene was tissue-restricted in normal tissues but highly expressed in lung cancer tissues and some cancer cell lines. Immunoglobulin G antibody specific to TCC52 was detected in serum samples from patients with prostate cancer (59.4%, 69/116), cholangiocarcinoma (17.6%, 6/34), laryngeal cancer (8%, 8/100) and lung cancer (5.6%, 4/71) in patients, rather than from healthy donors. Based on its restricted expression pattern and immunogenicity in some types of tumor, TCC52, as a novel CT antigen, would be a promising candidate for cancer immunotherapy.","title":"Novel centrosome protein, TCC52, is a cancer-testis antigen.","pubmedId":"18957058"}
