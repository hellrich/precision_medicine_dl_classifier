Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 109 NSCLC patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE). EML4-ALK was identified using paraffin embedded tumor cells in pleural effusion samples by immunohistochemistry (Ventana). EGFR mutation was determined by cell-free DNA in MPE, using cell denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC).  Results:   5 of 109 (4.58%) were identified as EML4-ALK cases using paraffin embedded tumor cells in MPE; EML4-ALK cases were detected in 5/61(8.20%) patients of the EGFR wild type subgroup. Patients with an EML4-ALK rearrangement were more likely to be of the EGFR wild type subgroup (5/5, P \u003d0.043). The concordance of EML4-ALK and EGFR mutation in pleural effusions and in biopsy/surgical tissue was 88.9% and 83.3%, respectively. For patients with EML4-ALK rearrangement in MPE, the progression free survival (PFS) was inferior when compared to patients with EGFR mutation, and similar to the EGFR/ALK double negative groups for treatment with EGFR-TKI (1.00 vs. 8.27 vs. 3.03months, P\u003d 0.009). However, PFS appeared to be prolonged in chemotherapy (9.27 vs. 6.53 vs. 3.33 months, P\u003d 0.095) as compared to the other two groups. Moreover, patients with EML4-ALK in MPE benefited from crizotinib treatment.  Conclusions:   EML4-ALK rearrangement detection in malignant pleural effusions can be used as a complementary method for EML4-ALK detection. Gene mutations in pleural effusions have predictive value for treatment.","title":"EML4-ALK rearrangement detection in malignant pleural effusions from patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Feasibility and predictive value.","pubmedId":"ASCO_151904-156"}
