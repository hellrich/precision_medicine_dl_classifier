A 36-year-old woman, hospitalized with a chief complaint of headache and unproductive cough, was diagnosed as having primary lung adenocarcinoma (T4N1M1 oss) and was given systemic chemotherapy. Although progressive deterioration of her headache continued, repeated neurological examination, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and cranial CT scans failed to show evidence of metastasis to the central nervous system, and the only finding suggesting CNS involvement was an elevated CEA level in CSF. Later in the course of her treatment, the patient suddenly lost her vision and subsequently consciousness due to acute increased intracranial pressure, and emergency ventricular drainage was performed for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Malignant cells were found in CSF obtained from a ventricular drainage and she was treated successfully by systemic and intrathecal chemotherapeutic agents. She was discharged after a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation for hydrocephalus; a double-dome reservoir was used for continuous intrathecal administration of the anticancer drugs, and a shunt filter was located in the tube to prevent the dissemination of cancer cells. In addition to methotrexate and cytosine arabinoside, ACNU and interleukin-2 were administered intrathecally without serious adverse effects, but no apparent therapeutic effects were noted either. She survived over 2 years after DMLC was first diagnosed. At autopsy DMLC secondary to lung adenocarcinoma was confirmed, but no evidence of leukoencephalopathy due to aggressive intrathecal chemotherapy was found. Current therapy for patients with DMLC and its clinical problems are discussed in relation to our experience in this case.","title":"[A case of long-term survival of a patient with complicated diffuse metastatic leptomeningeal carcinomatosis secondary to lung adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"2243465"}
