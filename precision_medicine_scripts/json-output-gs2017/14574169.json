This study explored, among women with early-onset breast cancer (\u003c50 years): 1) knowledge regarding breast cancer risk factors and hereditary breast cancer; and 2) differences in knowledge based on risk for hereditary disease. Participants recruited from 34 Virginia hospitals responded to two questionnaires. The Family History Questionnaire assessed risk for hereditary breast cancer. The Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs Questionnaire evaluated knowledge of general breast cancer risk factors and hereditary breast cancer. Of 314 respondents, 273 (87%) returned both questionnaires. A total of 137 (52%) participants met the study\u0027s criteria for hereditary breast cancer risk. Most participants knew common breast cancer-associated risk factors, including family history of breast cancer. Only 35% recognized family history of non-breast malignancies as a risk factor for breast cancer. Most participants recognized that prophylactic mastectomy does not eliminate breast cancer risk (63%), that not all women carrying a mutation develop disease (73%), and that men can develop breast cancer (96%). The majority selected \u0027I don\u0027t know\u0027 for knowledge of several characteristics of hereditary breast cancer, including: early-onset disease (54%); multifocal or bilateral disease (62%); risk transmission through fathers (58%); association with other cancer types (61%); and male breast cancer (70%). Knowledge regarding hereditary breast cancer did not vary between women with suspected hereditary disease and those with presumed sporadic disease. These data highlight the need for information regarding hereditary breast cancer for early-onset breast cancer survivors.","title":"Knowledge about breast cancer risk factors and hereditary breast cancer among early-onset breast cancer survivors.","pubmedId":"14574169"}
