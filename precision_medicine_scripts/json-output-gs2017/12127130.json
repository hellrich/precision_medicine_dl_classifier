In the late period we used percutaneous transhepatic portal vein embolization (PTPE) before extended right hepatectomy; S4a + S5 + S1 hepatectomy for elderly patients and those with poor liver function; and routine total caudate lobectomy including the paracaval portion and resection of the inferior portion of the medial segment (S4a). Sixty-five (74.7%) of the 87 patients underwent hepatectomy: 40 in the early period and 25 in the late period. Bile duct resection alone was performed in 22 patients, all in the early period. Resection was curative in 54.8% in the early period and 88.0% in the late period. The 3- and 5-year survival rates in the early period were 27.1% and 20.2%, respectively, as compared to 59.9% and 49.9% in the late period. Analysis of the 25 hepatectomies in the late period revealed improved survival times compared to patients treated by PTPE with extended right hepatectomy. No complications occurred after extended left hepatectomy or S4a + S5 + S1 hepatectomy, but four patients (16%) who underwent extended right hepatectomy plus PTPE died postoperatively. Our policy has resulted in improved outcome in patients with hilar bile duct carcinoma.","title":"Surgical treatment of hilar bile duct carcinoma: experience with 25 consecutive hepatectomies.","pubmedId":"12127130"}
