The studies covered a total of 65 pigs: 20 purebred Landrace [L], 22 crossbreeds of Landrace with the Yorkshire [L x Y] and 23 three-breed crosses (Landrace x Yorkshire) x Duroc [(L x Y) x D]. In the case of gene PKM2 one may observe in (L x Y) x D crossbreds, compared to L x Y crossbreds, an increased expression, closely related with the increase in dry matter content, including intramuscular fat, as well as a more favourable progress of glycolytic and energy metabolism during the early time post mortem (pH(45) and R(1)). Compared with Landrace animals, the lower expression of the CAST gene observed in (L x Y) x D pigs is manifested by a marked improvement of meat quality (R(1) pH(45) pH(24), pH(48)), arising from the rate of glycolytic and energy metabolism, typical for normal meat, that in effect results in its higher culinary and technological value.","title":"The expression of genes PKM2 and CAST in the muscle tissue of pigs differentiated by glycolytic potential and drip loss, with reference to the genetic group.","pubmedId":"20374765"}
