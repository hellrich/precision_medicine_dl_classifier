Mutations within the TP53 (exons 5-8) and Ki-ras (exon 2) genes were detected by PCR-SSCP analyses following sequencing.\nMutation analyses of exons 5 to 8 of the TP53 gene showed mutations in 43% (68/160) of the cases, while mutation analyses of exon 2 of the Ki-ras gene showed mutations in 46% (74/160) of the cases. Multivariate analyses showed that clinical outcome were strongly associated with the presence of specific TP53 mutations in L3 domain alone (only in DFS) or in combination with specific Ki-ras mutations at codon 13.\nSpecific TP53 mutations in L3 domain alone (only in DFS) or in combination with specific Ki-ras mutations at codon 13 are associated with a worse prognosis in sporadic CRC.","title":"Specific TP53 and/or Ki-ras mutations as independent predictors of clinical outcome in sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas: results of a 5-year Gruppo Oncologico dell\u0027Italia Meridionale (GOIM) prospective study.","pubmedId":"15923430"}
