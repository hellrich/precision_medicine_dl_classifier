Discovery at that time of the critical biological role of Kit in gastrointestinal stromal tumor led to the development of one of the most exciting examples of targeted therapy to date. The success of the Kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, formerly STI-571), has caught the attention of the medical community. With the use of targeted therapy in a targetable disease, new developments in our understanding of epidemiology, genetics, histopathology, radiographic imaging and the biology of gastrointestinal stromal tumor have become apparent. Recent findings are discussed herein.\nContinued intense study of gastrointestinal stromal tumor may lead to new paradigms that could revolutionize all of oncology.","title":"New developments in gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","pubmedId":"16721136"}
