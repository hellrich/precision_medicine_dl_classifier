Putative target genes located in this region include MDM2, CDK4, and GLI. To evaluate the involvement of these genes in bladder cancer, we screened a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 2317 samples by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Amplification was found for MDM2 in 5.1%, for CDK4 in 1.1%, and for GLI in 0.4% of interpretable tumors. Among tumors having amplification of at least one of these 12q13-q15 genes, 76.6% had amplification of MDM2 alone and 6.4% had amplification of CDK4 alone. Coamplifications were seen of MDM2 and CDK4 in 10.6%, and of CDK4 and GLI in 6.4%. Neither coamplifications of all three genes nor isolated GLI amplifications were found. These data suggest a prominent role of MDM2 as a 12q13-q15 amplification target in bladder cancer. However, independent CDK4 amplifications do also occur suggesting either two non-overlapping amplification sites or else a minimal overlapping region between MDM2 and CDK4 perhaps containing another yet unknown oncogene. The frequency of amplification increased significantly from stage pTa to pT1-4 (P\u003c0.04) and from low to high grade (P\u003c0.005). These data are consistent with a high level of genetic instability in invasively growing and high-grade bladder tumors.","title":"Amplification pattern of 12q13-q15 genes (MDM2, CDK4, GLI) in urinary bladder cancer.","pubmedId":"11971182"}
