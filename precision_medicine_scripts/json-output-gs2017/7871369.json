In addition, the number of AgNORs was significantly lower in chronic pancreatitis than in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (p \u003c 0.001).\nThe diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is usually clear. Difficulties can be encountered, however, in cases of chronic pancreatitis, specially when biopsy material is small. Our results suggest that the number of AgNORs may help in distinguishing between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, especially in diagnostically difficult specimens.","title":"Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions may help the differential diagnostic distinction between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"7871369"}
