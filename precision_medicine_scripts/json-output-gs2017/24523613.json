Recent studies have indicated that tumour resistance to braf inhibition is mediated by upregulated epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) signalling, disruption of which is a routine treatment strategy in KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer. In this report, we describe the clinical course of a heavily pretreated patient who elected to receive off-label dual-targeted braf- and egfr-inhibitory therapy with good tolerance and apparent clinical benefit.
