We investigated the effects of the germ-line single nucleotide polymorphisms TP53 R72P (215G\u003eC) and MDM2 SNP309 (-410T\u003eG), and p53 protein expression in breast tumors on survival.\nWe pooled data from four breast cancer cohorts within the Breast Cancer Association Consortium for which both TP53 R72P and MDM2 SNP309 were genotyped and follow-up was available (n \u003d 3,749). Overall and breast cancer-specific survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox\u0027s proportional hazards regression models.\nSurvival of patients did not differ by carriership of either germ-line variant, R72P (215G\u003eC) or SNP309 (-410G\u003eT) alone. Immunohistochemical p53 staining of the tumor was available for two cohorts (n \u003d 1,109 patients). Survival was worse in patients with p53-positive tumors (n \u003d 301) compared to patients with p53-negative tumors (n \u003d 808); breast cancer-specific survival: HR 1.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.1), P \u003d 0.001. Within the patient group with p53-negative tumors, TP53 rare homozygous (CC) carriers had a worse survival than G-allele (GG/GC) carriers; actuarial breast cancer-specific survival 71% versus 80%, P \u003d 0.07; HR 1.8 (1.1 to 3.1), P \u003d 0.03. We also found a differential effect of combinations of the two germ-line variants on overall survival; homozygous carriers of the G-allele in MDM2 had worse survival only within the group of TP53 C-allele carriers; actuarial overall survival (GG versus TT/TG) 64% versus 75%, P \u003d 0.001; HR (GG versus TT) 1.5 (1.1 to 2.0), P \u003d 0.01. We found no evidence for a differential effect of MDM2 SNP309 by p53 protein expression on survival.\nThe TP53 R72P variant may be an independent predictor for survival of patients with p53-negative tumors. The combined effect of TP53 R72P and MDM2 SNP309 on survival is in line with our a priori biologically-supported hypothesis, that is, the role of enhanced DNA repair function of the TP53 Pro-variant, combined with increased expression of the Mdm2 protein, and thus overall attenuation of the p53 pathway in the tumor cells.","title":"Combined effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms TP53 R72P and MDM2 SNP309, and p53 expression on survival of breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"20021639"}
