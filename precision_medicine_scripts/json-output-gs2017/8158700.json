Putative mutation of the p53 gene (also known as TP53) has also been found to occur frequently in stage I and II NSCLCs and to be associated with more aggressive disease and a poorer prognosis.\nOur purpose was to determine the Rb protein status in the same cohort that had been previously studied for their p53 protein status and to document whether loss of Rb protein expression was also an important factor in overall survival.\nOne hundred one stage I or II NSCLC specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. These paraffin-embedded tumor sections were obtained from individual paraffin blocks prepared for each patient in the previous study. Patient survival status was obtained from hospital and tumor registry records.\nAltered Rb protein expression was found in 24 of 101 stage I and II NSCLCs. The median survival was 32 months for patients with Rb-positive (Rb+) tumors and 18 months for individuals in whom expression of Rb protein was absent or altered (Rb-) in tumor cells. Log-rank analysis of the differences in overall survival was statistically significant (P \u003d .007). When these results were combined with the p53 status in the same tumor, the median survival was 12 months for those individuals who had theoretically the worst pattern (Rb-/p53+) and 46 months for those patients with theoretically the best pattern (Rb+/p53-) (P \u003c .001). The Rb+ and Rb- groups in this cohort were well balanced with respect to the distribution of age, disease stage, histologic types, p53 status, and sex. Using a multivariate proportional hazards regression model, both altered Rb and p53 status were found to be significantly associated with poor prognosis (P \u003d .005 and .012, respectively) in the overall cohort.\nAltered Rb protein expression is an independent prognostic marker for overall decreased survival in early-stage NSCLC as detected by absence of nuclear Rb protein staining. There appears to be a poorer prognosis when loss of Rb protein function and mutated p53 protein occur in the same tumor.\nIf these findings can be confirmed in larger prospective studies, the results would suggest that both the Rb and p53 status should be utilized as independent prognostic factors in early-stage NSCLC.","title":"Altered retinoblastoma protein expression and prognosis in early-stage non-small-cell lung carcinoma.","pubmedId":"8158700"}
