In this study, a full-length expression plasmid for FGFR1 was obtained by fragment amplification. The amplified PCR product was then digested and inserted into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. A recombinant eukaryotic expression vector containing the complete CDS region of FGFR1 was successfully constructed. After it was transfected to Hek293 cell, the expression of the FGFR1 receptor in recombinant Hek293/FGFR1 was 18 times higher than that of Hek293 cell. The biological activities of high expression FGFR1 cell (Hek293/FGFR1) were verified by FCM, immunofluorescent, RT-PCR, western blot and cell cycle analysis. Then, Hek293/FGFR1 was used to screen taspine with cell membrane chromatography (CMC). Finally, we analyzed the effects of taspine on Hek293/FGFR1 cell and MCF-7 cell. In conclusion, Hek293/FGFR1 was successfully constructed. The results demonstrate that taspine can down-regulate phosphorylation of FGFR1 and ERK, and inhibit Hek293/FGFR1 and MCF-7 cell proliferation.","title":"Construction of recombinant FGFR1 containing full-length gene and its potential application.","pubmedId":"20434485"}
