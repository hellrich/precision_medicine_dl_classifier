Pathologic histology inspection of the tumor was judged to be effective prior to resection. The first case is a 68-year-old male who underwent a sigmoidectomy as a stage III A sigmoid colon cancer in March 2003. Afterwards, distant metastases had occurred to the liver, the left lung and neck lymph nodes from 2003 to 2006. Three operations and systemic chemotherapy were performed. A new metastasis of the right lung occurred in November 2006. The FOLFOX chemotherapy was performed 7 times, the tumor was not changed in the image, and the effect judgment was SD. After the chemotherapy, a partial resection of the right lung was performed in November 2007. Half of the tumor resulted in necrosis on the specimen (Grade 1b). The second case is a 63-year-old female who underwent an anterior resection of the rectum as a stage II rectal cancer in January 2000, a partial resection of the right lung as a metachronous right pulmonary metastasis in March 2003, and post operative chemotherapy (IFL) were performed. A new metastasis of the right lung occurred in September 2005. The FOLFOX chemotherapy was performed 4 times, the tumor was not changed in the image, and the effect judgment was SD. After the chemotherapy, a partial resection of the right lung was performed in April 2006. One third of the tumor resulted in necrosis on the specimen (Grade 1a).\nIt was thought that FOLFOX chemotherapy can be a promising candidate for neoadjuvant treatment of pulmonary metastasis from postoperative colorectal cancer.","title":"[Two resected cases of pulmonary metastasis from post operative colorectal cancer after preoperative chemotherapy with FOLFOX].","pubmedId":"20037370"}
