{"publicationTypes":["English Abstract","Journal Article"],"abstract":"To explore the changing trend and clinical significance of disease spectrum of biliary surgery among 30 years in PLA General Hospital.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 21 189 consecutive patients with biliary diseases in PLA General Hospital between January 1985 and December 2014 according to the inclusion criteria. Taking 5 years as a research group, all patients were divided into 6 groups, and then the 30 years of the disease spectrum of biliary surgery was described.\n(1) From January 1985 to December 2014, the PLA General Hospital performed 21 189 cases of patients with biliary surgery diseases, including 9 460 cases of male, 11 729 cases of female (female∶male\u003d1.24∶1). The average age was 52.1±13.5 years old (6-98 years). (2) Of the all cases, the most patients was cholelithiasis, accounting for 65.26%, and gallbladder stones accounting for 53.61%. The following disease was cholangiocarcinoma, accounting for 12.79%, and hilar cholangiocarcinoma accounting for 5.95%. (3) From the perspective of disease spectrum changing trend, the proportion of patients with cholelithiasis were decreased gradually, from 74.9% to 65.2%, while the proportion of patients with cholangiocarcinoma showed a gradual upward trend, rising from 6% to 14% (P\u003c0.05); and the proportion of bile duct cystic dilatation and gallbladder carcinoma shared a gradual increase(P\u003c0.05), however, the variation of proportion of gallbladder polyps and biliary stricture were not statistically significant (P\u003e0.05). (4) In patients with cholelithiasis, the proportion of patients with gallbladder stones increased gradually from 71.9% to 82%, while the proportion of patients with bile duct stones decreased gradually from 28.1% to 18%. There was no statistical significance in the proportion of different types of cholangiocarcinoma patients (P\u003e0.05) (40% of the patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma, 25% of the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 35% of the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma).\nWith the time changing, the disease spectrum of biliary surgery has also changed. The proportion of patients with cholelithiasis, especially the patients with bile duct stones, was declining gradually, and the proportion of patients with cholangiocarcinoma was increasing gradually.","title":"[Analysis of disease spectrum of biliary surgery among 30 years in a single center].","pubmedId":"27373359"}
