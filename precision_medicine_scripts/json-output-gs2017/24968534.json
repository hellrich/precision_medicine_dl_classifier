Majority of breast cancer cases in India at presentation are locally advanced, that is large breast tumours (\u003e 5 cm in diameter) with skin or chest wall involvement or with involvement of locoregional lymph nodes. These locally advanced breast cancers are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy with trastuzumab containing regimen in Her2 Neu positive cases. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy is considered for those who are elderly or medically unfit/unwilling for chemotherapy and strongly positive for oestrogen/progestrogen receptors. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not improve overall or disease-free survival but response to neoadjuvant therapy is the best surrogate prognostic marker.","title":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: review of literature.","pubmedId":"24968534"}
