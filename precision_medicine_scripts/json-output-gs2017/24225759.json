TSAs with an SSA/P precursor lesion were usually found in the proximal colon, while TSAs with an HP or with no precursor lesion were mainly located in the distal colon and rectum (P \u003c .001). TSAs with a precursor lesion showed a lower frequency of conventional epithelial dysplasia and KRAS mutation as well as a higher frequency of BRAF mutation compared with those with no precursor lesion (P \u003d .002, P \u003c .001, and P \u003c .001, respectively).\nA significant proportion of HP or SSA/P precursor lesions accompanied by TSAs can be detected by endoscopy based on both their flat-elevated growth and type II pit patterns. The heterogeneity of TSAs in terms of clinicopathologic and molecular features correlated with the status or type of precursor lesions.","title":"Traditional serrated adenoma of the colorectum: clinicopathologic implications and endoscopic findings of the precursor lesions.","pubmedId":"24225759"}
