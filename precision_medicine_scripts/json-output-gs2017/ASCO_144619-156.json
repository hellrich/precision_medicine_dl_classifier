Methods:    Treatment-nave pts with common EGFR mut (Del19 or L858R), stage IIIB/IV/post-operative recurrence were randomized to either G (IPASS, NEJ002, WJTOG3405) or E (ENSURE, EURTAC, OPTIMAL) vs CT. We performed Cox regression to obtain hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the overall population and pre-specified subgroups. We calculated pooled treatment estimate using the inverse variance weighted method. Results:    Amongst 1231 pts (Del19 \u003d 682, L858R \u003d 540, Del19 and L858R \u003d 9), 632 received EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and 599 received CT. The median follow-up was 35.0 months, and 780 (63%) pts had died. Following progression, 74% (CT group) received EGFR-TKI and 66% (EGFR-TKI group) received CT. There was no difference in OS between EGFR-TKI and CT (median 25.8 vs 26.0 months, HR \u003d 1.01 [CI 0.88-1.17; P \u003d 0.84]). There was no significant difference between Del19 (HR \u003d 0.96, CI 0.79-1.16, P \u003d 0.64) and L858R (HR \u003d 1.06, CI 0.86-1.32; P \u003d 0.59) subgroups (P-interaction \u003d 0.47). There was also no significant difference according to smoking status (P-interaction \u003d 1.00), sex (P-interaction \u003d 0.80), performance status (P-interaction \u003d 0.88), age (P-interaction \u003d 0.61), ethnicity (P-interaction \u003d 0.63), histology (P-interaction \u003d 0.84), and staging (P-interaction \u003d 0.43). Performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2: median 34.0 vs 24.1 vs 15.7 months, P-logrank \u003c 0.001) and staging (IV vs IIIB vs post-operative recurrence: median 23.9 vs 31.0 vs 42.7 months, P-logrank \u003c 0.001) were prognostic for OS. Conclusions:   Despite significant PFS benefit, there is no OS difference with first-line G or E when compared with CT in advanced NSCLC with common EGFR mut, probably due to high rate of cross-over at progression. There is no significant difference in EGFR-TKI treatment benefit in all subgroups. Poor performance status and stage IV cancer are associated with poorer OS.","title":"The impact on overall survival (OS) of first-line gefitinib (G) and erlotinib (E) and of clinical factors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (EGFR mut) based on meta-analysis of 1,231 patients (pts) enrolled in 6 major randomized trials.","pubmedId":"ASCO_144619-156"}
