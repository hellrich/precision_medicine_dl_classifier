Despite significant advances in targeted and immunotherapies, most patients cannot still be cured. Our aim is to identify new drug combinations that are synergistic in BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma, a sub-type representing 30% of cases for which targeted therapies are not currently available. We high-throughput screened a collection of 20 BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cell lines with 180 drug combinations (60 library drugs used at 5 different concentrations combined with 3 clinically relevant anchor drugs) and generated over 8000 survival curves . We found that 25% of cell lines are highly sensitive to a combination of nilotinib plus trametinib and confirmed this finding with 2 independent assays. We further validated the drug synergy firstly using an independent collection of BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cell lines (n\u003d7), then a collection of BRAF/NRAS wild type patient derived xenotransplant cultures (n\u003d3), and finally with a collection of BRAFV600E and NRASQ61 melanoma cell lines (n\u003d12). Further, we generated a gene expression signature of cell lines that display synergy for the nilotinib/trametinib combination, and used it to classify human melanomas from Leeds Melanoma Project (N\u003d171) and TCGA (n\u003d470) cohorts. Tumors classified as “synergistic-like” (27.9 and 36.7%, respectively) are associated to decreased overall and recurrence free survival (P\u003c0.05), suggesting that our combination might be effective in a relevant fraction of aggressive tumors. In order to identify drug resistance mechanisms we deployed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen. We found that loss of the tuberous sclerosis complex can confer resistance to nilotinib/trametinib, and validated this mechanism using clonal engineered lines. Since tuberous sclerosis complex genes are mutated in 10% of melanomas, this approach can help to identify patients potentially refractory to the treatment. We also investigated the molecular mechanism of nilotinib/trametinib synergy by analysing the level of several phosphoproteins upon treatment. We discovered that the nilotinib/trametinib combination synergistically reduce the level of P-ERK in synergistic cell lines but not in cell lines resistant to the drug combination, thus pointing out the MAPK pathway dependence of the synergy. This finding provides a putative marker to identify tumors responsive to the treatment. Finally, we tested in vivo the nilotinib/trametinib combination in a patient derived xenotransplant mouse model and showed that the combination is well tolerated and significantly more effective than the 2 drugs alone (P\u003c0.01). These data suggest a strong clinical translation potential for nilotinib/trametinib combination and pave the way to the development of clinical trials for BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma.","title":"New therapies for the treatment of BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-3717"}
