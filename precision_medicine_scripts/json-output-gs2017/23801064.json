IGF1R mRNA levels were determined via quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Serum IGF1 was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nSerum IGF1 concentrations and mucosal IGF1R mRNA levels were significantly higher in patients with adenomatous polyps (n \u003d 24) or carcinoma (n \u003d 13) compared with healthy control subjects (n \u003d 13). There was a significant positive correlation between serum IGF1 and mucosal IGF1R mRNA in patients with adenomatous polyps.\nHigh circulating IGF1 concentrations and mucosal IGF1R expression may play important roles in both the formation and development of colorectal carcinoma. IGF1 and its receptor may be activated before carcinogenesis, and may promote the growth and malignant transformation of adenomatous polyps. IGF1 and IGF1R may be useful biomarkers for evaluating the stage and risk of carcinogenesis.","title":"The role of insulin-like growth factor 1 and its receptor in the formation and development of colorectal carcinoma.","pubmedId":"23801064"}
