Diagnosis is based on histological and immunohistochemical examination, and these rare tumors are characterized by c-kit (CD117) staining. Complete removal of the tumor is often curative in localized gastrointestinal stromal tumors and is always recommended. Clinically, their behavior is difficult to predict, and mitotic count and tumor size seem to be the most effective prognostic factors. We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical presentation and course, surgical management and pathological features of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated in our institution from 1995 to 2003. Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study, and all of them underwent surgery. There were two perioperative deaths, and global morbidity was about 13%. Nineteen patients were followed (mean, 31 months): 4 patients had disease progression/recurrence and died, and one patient experienced a local recurrence and was reoperated with a curative intent; 14 patients were disease free. Our experience shows that histological and immunohistochemical examinations are fundamental for a definitive diagnosis and to assess the risk of aggressive behavior. Moreover, our results confirm that in stromal tumors complete surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment in localized gastrointestinal stromal tumors, although the recurrence rate is relatively high. It is conceivable that treatment and prognosis of metastatic and non-resectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as well as the adjuvant treatment of high-risk, radically excised gastrointestinal stromal tumors will be strongly impacted by the c-kit target therapy.","title":"Management of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors: experience from an Italian hospital.","pubmedId":"16457143"}
