We determined the status of c-erbB2 expression in our patients with NSCLC and investigated its correlation with disease stage, histological type and response to treatment. Eighty-four patients were examined for the expression of c-erbB2 by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody. The scoring criteria of Clinical Trial Assay (CTA) were used to evaluate staining (0 to +3). c-erbB2 overexpression was determined in 35% of the cases. Tumors from higher stage disease (stage IIIb-IV) were more often c-erbB2 positive in adenocarcinoma (ADC) (p\u003d0.04). In addition, there was an association between c-erbB2 score and disease stage in ADC patients (p\u003d0.03). Our study did not demonstrate an association of c-erbB2 overexpression with response to chemotherapy. We conclude that c-erbB2 overexpression may be a prognostic marker for evaluating tumor progression in NSCLC patients but further studies must be performed with larger patient populations.","title":"Prevalence and prognostic value of c-erbB2 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","pubmedId":"12937837"}
