Each chemotherapy cycle consisted of intravenous gemcitabine, 700 mg/m(2), on day 1 and orally administered S-1, 50 mg/m(2), for 7 consecutive days, after which there was a 1-week pause of chemotherapy.\nTwenty-seven patients were entered into this study. According to the TNM system, 4 (15%), 2 (7%), 6 (22%), and 15 (56%) patients were diagnosed with stage IA, IB, IIA, and IIB disease, respectively. Overall and disease-free survival rates were 86% and 60% at 1 year, 66% and 45% at 2 years, and 33% and 45% at 3 years, respectively. Toxicity during chemotherapy was mild.\nAdjuvant gemcitabine plus S-1 chemotherapy appears to be a promising treatment for patients after surgical resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"Adjuvant gemcitabine plus S-1 chemotherapy after surgical resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18367131"}
