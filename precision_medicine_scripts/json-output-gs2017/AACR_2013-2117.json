We recently demonstrated that LSA induces rapid and reversible premature chromosome condensation (PCC) associated with profound epigenetic alterations in different cell types, independently of cyclin-dependent kinases activation. In order to identify cellular targets involved in LSA sensitivity, we used a pool of kinases and phosphatases shRNAs in the human colon carcinoma HCT-116 cell line. Among the genes whose inactivation promotes the survival of LSA-treated cells, we observed an enrichment of genes involved in mitotic functions including Raf1, a well-known serine-threonine kinase regulating cell proliferation and survival. LSA induces the rapid and reversible phosphorylation of Raf1 on Ser338 in a time- and a dose-dependent manner. To establish a causal relationship between LSA-induced PCC and Raf1, we first used siRNA targeting Raf1. Knocking-down Raf1 decreased LSA-induced PCC. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts depleted in Raf1 were found resistant to LSA-induced PCC. Our results suggest a novel role of Raf1 in chromatin condensation. They also demonstrate that the target of LSA affects the c-Raf pathway and a novel mechanism of action of LSA as an effective inducer of PCC and potential novel anticancer agent.Citation Format: Yong-Wei Zhang, Rozenn Josse, Arun Ghosh, Ji Luo, Yves Pommier.
