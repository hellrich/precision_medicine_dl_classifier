The abnormal expression of c-Met gene is correlated with the tumorigenesis and development of lung cancer. Once the tyrosine kinase is activated by the interaction between the HGF ligand and the TK receptor, and the activated kinase will promote the cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of different tumors, as well as lung cancer. The targeted therapy to HGF/c-Met signal pathway is a new highlight in the treatments of lung cancer. In this review, we will discuss the dysregulation of HGF/c-Met signal pathway in lung cancer and the new progress for the targeted drugs to this pathway. \nc-MET是原癌基因c-MET编码的蛋白产物，是肝细胞生长因子（hepatocyte growth factor, HGF）受体，具有络氨酸激酶活性。c-Met的异常表达与肺癌的发生发展有着密切的关系。HGF与其c-Met受体结合后，活化c-Met酪氨酸激酶活性，能促进多种肿瘤细胞包括肺癌细胞的增殖、新生血管生成及肿瘤侵袭和迁移。针对HGF/c-Met信号转导通路的靶向治疗是目前肺癌治疗的新热点。本文将就HGF/c-Met信号转导通路在肺癌中异常调控及其靶向药物在肺癌中的研究进展进行综述。","title":"[Dysregulation of HGF/c-Met signal pathway and their targeting drugs in lung cancer].","pubmedId":"25130970"}
