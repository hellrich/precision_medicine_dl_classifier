Two cases of uncommon extragnathic psammomatoid fibrous dysplasia and a mixed control group of 15 cases of low-grade osteosarcoma and 15 cases of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma were included. MDM2 amplification was found in 33% of ossifying fibromas (peak of 69% for the juvenile variant) and in 12% of fibrous dysplasia, in none of which was MDM2 overexpressed. All control cases exhibited MDM2 amplification and overexpression. To investigate possible polysomy of chromosome 12, we studied RASAL1 amplification, a gene telomeric to MDM2 on the long arm of chromosome 12. RASAL1 amplification was reported in all benign fibro-osseous lesions exhibiting MDM2 amplification but not in controls. Simultaneous amplification of these two genes was significantly higher in juvenile ossifying fibromas compared with fibrous dysplasia (P\u003d0.004), non-juvenile ossifying fibromas (P\u003d0.001), and all other benign craniofacial fibro-osseous lesions combined (P\u003d0.0001). Of the nine cases of juvenile ossifying fibroma exhibiting amplification, three were locally invasive and four were recurrent, suggesting aggressive disease. The two cases of extragnathic psammomatoid fibrous dysplasia also showed MDM2 and RASAL1 amplification with no MDM2 overexpression. This large chromosome 12 rearrangement, spanning MDM2 and RASAL1, is the first recurrent molecular abnormality to be reported in juvenile ossifying fibroma. It may represent both a molecular diagnostic marker and a characteristic of more aggressive forms with a higher risk of recurrence. Finally, the presence of this rearrangement in extragnathic psammomatoid fibro-osseous lesions mimicking ossifying fibromas might reflect a common molecular pathway in their pathogenesis and calls into question the classification of such lesions within fibrous dysplasia.
