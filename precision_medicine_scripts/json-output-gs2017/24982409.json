The ALK+ group had a significantly lower response rate than the other two groups. Progression-free survival was significantly shorter in the ALK+ cohort compared to the EGFR+ (p\u003c0.001) and wild-type cohorts (p\u003d0.0121).\nNSCLC patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene might be relatively insensitivite to cytotoxic chemotherapy.","title":"Non-small cell lung cancer patients with EML4-ALK fusion gene are insensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"24982409"}
