Thus, more effective multimodality treatment should be established. Chemoradiotherapy has become a standard treatment for gastric cancer especially as an adjuvant therapy while radiotherapy has been expected as one of the modalities against highly advanced gastric cancer.   Methods:   Patients with advanced gastric cancer who were treated with chemotherapy of S-1 and cisplatin plus radiation were analyzed retrospectively. Concurrent radiation therapy (5 days/week) at 2 Gy/day was started with chemotherapy and repeated daily on days 15, 812, 1519 and 2226. Irradiation was planned using a computed tomography (CT) simulator for two rectangular portals with a pair of 45-degree wedge filters and was targeted at the primary tumor and surrounding lesions, including lymph nodes.  Results:    A total 109 patients were treated with chemoradiotherapy between 2002 and 2013 at our institute. The median age was 64 years. Histological type included 45 differentiated and undifferentiated 64 subtypes. The TNM stage before the treatment was diagnosed as IIIA: 11; IIIB: 10; IIIC: 14; IV: 74. Of the 98 evaluable patients, 69 patients had partial responses while no patients had a complete response, resulting in an overall response rate of 70%. Progressive disease (PD) occurred in 2 patients (4%). The most frequent adverse events more than grade 3 were hematologic toxicities, including leukocytopenia (47%), neutropenia (25%), and thrombocytopenia (24%). Non-hematologic toxicities such as general fatigue, renal-related events, and gastrointestinal toxicities were manageable with no treatment-related death. The median survival time was 537 days.  Conclusions:    While there were disadvantages of radiotherapy including the difficulty of confirming the area of irradiation due to peristaltic movement, risk of perforation and ulceration, recent technological advancement of radiation therapy has enabled pinpoint accuracy in treatment of primary gastric lesions and regional lymph nodes. There has been much anticipation that chemoradiotherapy will be a part of multidisciplinary treatment for advanced cancer.","title":"Chemoradiotherapy for highly advanced gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_122651-143"}
