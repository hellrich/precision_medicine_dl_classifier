A Whipple resection was performed. Histologic examination of the tumor showed scanty tumor cells arranged in a single-file manner set within a desmoplastic sclerotic stroma. In other areas, the tumor was arranged around preexisting ducts in a targetoid fashion. Very focal ductal and signet-ring cell differentiation was noted. This unusual variant of pancreatic cancer was characterized by paucicellularity and a pattern of invasion resembling lobular carcinoma of breast.","title":"Paucicellular infiltrating ductal carcinoma of pancreas: an unusual variant.","pubmedId":"17240307"}
