One pathway through which mutant KRAS acts is an inflammatory pathway that involves the kinase IKK and activates the transcription factor NF-κB. BRAF, a kinase that is downstream of KRAS, is mutated in a subset of CRC and is predictive of poor prognosis and therapeutic resistance. We found that, in contrast to mutant KRAS, mutant BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) did not trigger NF-κB activation but instead triggered the phosphorylation of a proteolytic fragment of IKKα (p45-IKKα) in CRC cells. BRAF(V600E) CRC cells had a high abundance of phosphorylated p45-IKKα, which was decreased by a RAF inhibitor. However, the abundance and DNA binding of NF-κB in these cells were unaffected by the RAF inhibitor, and expression of BRAF(V600E) in human embryonic kidney-293T cells did not activate an NF-κB reporter. Moreover, BRAF-induced transformation of NIH-3T3 cells and BRAF-dependent transcription required phosphorylation of p45-IKKα. The kinase TAK1, which was associated with the endosomal compartment, phosphorylated p45-IKKα. Inhibition of endosomal vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) with chloroquine or bafilomycin A1 blocked p45-IKKα phosphorylation and induced apoptosis in BRAF-mutant CRC cells independent of autophagy. Treating mice with V-ATPase inhibitors reduced the growth and metastasis of BRAF(V600E) xenograft tumors in the cecum of mice.
