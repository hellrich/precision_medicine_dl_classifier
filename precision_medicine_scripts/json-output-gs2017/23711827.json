Patients were eligible if they had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with liver or extrahepatic metastasis and with no prior chemotherapy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the impact of age, sex, presence of extrahepatic metastasis, performance status, type of chemotherapy, number of lines of chemotherapy.\nThe median survival of all patients was 27.7 months (17.8-37.7). Univariate analysis showed that age less than 60 years at diagnosis, good performance status, no extrahepatic liver metastasis and the number of lines of chemotherapy were significantly associated with better survival. Multivariate analysis identified only performance status and the number of lines of chemotherapy as independent predictive factors of survival.\nOur data suggest that iterative chemotherapy may increase survival in patients with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Retrospective analysis of survival benefits of chemotherapy for metastatic or non-resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23711827"}
