In this study, we investigated the miRNA expression in lung adenocarcinomas with different oncogenic mutations, including EGFR-positive, KRAS-positive and EGFR/KRAS-negative tumors. The expression of 319 miRNAs was evaluated by Exiqon/Luminex microarray, and expression of individual miRNAs was validated by individual RT-PCR assays (Applied Biosystems). Overall, miRNA expression was similar among three mutationally different groups with most upregulated miRNAs being miR-20a, miR-328, miR-34c and miR-18b and most downregulated miRNAs being miR-32, miR-137 and miR-342. Four miRNAs (miR-155, miR-25, miR-495 and miR-7g) were expressed differently among these tumors. miR-155 was upregulated only in EGFR/KRAS-negative group, miR-25 was upregulated only in EGFR-positive group and miR-495 was upregulated only in KRAS-positive adenocarcinomas. In opposite, let-7g was downregulated in all three groups, with more significant downregulation in EGFR/KRAS-negative adenocarcinomas. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed significant correlation between miRNA expression patterns and somatic mutations. In this study, we demonstrated that despite the similarity in miRNA expression among lung adenocarcinomas with different somatic mutations, some miRNAs showed unique expression patterns, which were in strong correlation with the mutation type, suggesting different carcinogenic pathway for these tumors. These miRNAs can be further explored for their diagnostic and prognostic use.","title":"miRNA expression profiling of lung adenocarcinomas: correlation with mutational status.","pubmedId":"20818338"}
