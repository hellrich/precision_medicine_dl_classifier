Persistent lupus anticoagulants are associated with thrombotic disease, but not all are clinically significant. Antibody heterogeneity and reagent and test variability dictate that at least 2 tests, of different types, should be used to screen lupus anticoagulants. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the activated seven lupus anticoagulant assay detects clinically significant antibodies. Eighty-two patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and 32 with systemic lupus erythematosus + positive for activated seven lupus anticoagulant and who were without thrombosis, who were positive by activated seven lupus anticoagulant assay, were investigated for lupus anticoagulants by dilute Russell\u0027s viper venom time, dilute activated partial thromboplastin time, and Taipan snake venom time, and for anticardiolipin antibodies. Fifty-seven of the APS patients were positive for lupus anticoagulants in multiple assays, 25 in activated seven lupus anticoagulant alone. Fourteen of the latter group were previously positive in other antiphospholipid antibodies assays, and 11 had only been positive for lupus anticoagulants by activated seven lupus anticoagulant. Twenty-eight had elevated anticardiolipin antibodies, 6 of whom were from the group that was positive in activated seven lupus anticoagulant only. Eight of the systemic lupus erythematosus + lupus anticoagulants (without thrombosis) patients were positive for lupus anticoagulant by activated seven lupus anticoagulant alone and had only been positive in activated seven lupus anticoagulant previously, and none had elevated anticardiolipin antibodies. The remaining 24 patients were lupus-anticoagulant positive in multiple assays, and 9 had elevated anticardiolipin antibodies. Dilute Russell\u0027s viper venom time and Dilute activated partial thromboplastin time are widely used to detect lupus anticoagulants and are considered to detect clinically significant antibodies. Activated seven lupus anticoagulant detected antibodies in APS patients who were positive by these assays and also lupus anticoagulants undetectable by the dilute Russell\u0027s viper venom time/dilute activated partial thromboplastin time reagents used, demonstrating its utility as a first-line or second-line assay.","title":"The activated seven lupus anticoagulant assay detects clinically significant antibodies.","pubmedId":"17895508"}
