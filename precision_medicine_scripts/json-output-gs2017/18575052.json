The patient had been under immunosuppressive treatment for 2 years for Behçet\u0027s disease. However, he did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria of Behçet\u0027s disease. Blood analysis showed a very high C reactive protein (CRP at 34 mg/dl). In view of severe intra-ocular inflammation, the anterior chamber was punctured. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the aqueous humour and on the blood revealed the presence of Tropheryma whippelii DNA, an agent responsible for Whipple\u0027s disease. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol for 1 year with good clinical and biological evolution. This case illustrates the difficulty to diagnose an atypical Whipple\u0027s disease. In cases of uveitis with atypical signs and/or not responding to the treatment, the internist must consider to perform an analysis of the ocular fluids.","title":"An atypical case of Whipple\u0027s disease: case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"18575052"}
