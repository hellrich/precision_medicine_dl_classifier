The combination of both strategies offers an excellent model system to study tumor development. This study analyzes the potential cooperation of N-methylnitrosourea (MNU) treatment and N-ras proto-oncogene overexpression in tumorigenesis in transgenic mice. The overexpression of the N-ras proto-oncogene in these animals is associated with development of mammary tumors and lymphomas. After MNU treatment we analyzed tumor incidence and latency, levels of transgene expression, and pattern of ras mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of H-, K-, and N-ras genes in both tumor types. Transgenic mice treated with MNU had significantly (P \u003c 0.001) shorter latency of appearance of mammary tumors [8.6 +/- 3.0 (SD) months] than phosphate-buffered saline-treated transgenics (12.8 +/- 2.3 months). All mammary tumors overexpressed the N-ras transgene and lacked ras mutations. Moreover, MNU-treated transgenics had an incidence and latency of lymphomas similar to that of MNU-treated nontransgenic mice. No significant differences in incidence of point mutations (K-ras codon 12 or 13 and N-ras codon 61) in lymphomas were seen between these two groups. All lymphomas overexpressed the N-ras transgene, except for those carrying a K-ras point mutation. Overexpression of the N-ras proto-oncogene cooperates with non-ras genes mutated by MNU in mouse mammary carcinogenesis. Conversely, N-ras proto-oncogene overexpression does not show cooperation with MNU in lymphomagenesis in our system. This study suggests that proto-oncogene overexpression may be a mechanism of activation of the ras pathway, alternative to point mutation. Similarly to actions for ras genes activated by point mutation, overexpression of the N-ras protooncogene predisposes to tumorigenesis and cooperates with a carcinogen in tumorigenesis. The possibility that ras overexpression plays a role in human breast tumorigenesis requires active investigation.","title":"An overexpressed N-ras proto-oncogene cooperates with N-methylnitrosourea in mouse mammary carcinogenesis.","pubmedId":"7987834"}
