When the analysis of these trials was restricted to patients with common EGFR mutations only (exon 19 deletions and L858R), the advantage over chemotherapy was even more pronounced. A significant overall survival advantage was firstly demonstrated versus chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer-harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion (del19) mutations. First-line afatinib was also effective in patients with certain uncommon EGFR mutation and patients with central nervous system metastasis. So far, these data are not sufficient to conclude that afatinib is better than first-generation EGFR inhibitors. In addition, the toxicity profile of afatinib was somewhat worse than that observed with either erlotinib or gefitinib. In the absence of direct comparisons, for each patient the choice among the available EGFR inhibitors should take into account all the clinically relevant endpoints, including disease control, survival prolongation, tolerability, and quality of life.
