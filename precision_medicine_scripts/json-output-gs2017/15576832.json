These gene alterations were also studied in 11 other types of breast lesions.\nA differential pattern of alterations (deletion/amplification) was observed in the two age groups, with the sequence in younger women being BRCA1 (72%), TP53 (71%), ATM (64%), BRCA2 (62%), RB1 (60%), Cyclin D1 (43%), and BRCAX (24%) and that in the older group being TP53 (66%), RB1 (63%), BRCA1 (56%), ATM (53%), BRCA2 (45%), Cyclin D1 (24%), and BRCAX (23%). Similar, differential correlations were also seen with several clinicopathological parameters, prognosis, and combinations of alterations among these genes in the two age groups.\nDifferential frequencies and interrelationships of genetic alterations and prognoses in these two age groups indicate that the molecular pathways for the development of tumors in both age groups may not be similar, though the ultimate effect is deregulation of cell cycle checkpoints and defects in the DNA repair pathway.","title":"Differential association of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes with some breast cancer-associated genes in early and late onset breast tumors.","pubmedId":"15576832"}
