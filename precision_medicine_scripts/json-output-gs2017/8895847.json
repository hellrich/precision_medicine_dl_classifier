NGF and BDNF mRNA levels were high in the heart and spleen as well as in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord, showing similar spatial expression patterns, while NT-3 mRNA levels were more pronounced in the liver and spleen. In contrast to these neurotrophins, GDNF mRNA expression occurred at the highest levels in the muscle, and it was also comparatively high in the spinal cord. p75NGFR mRNA was expressed extensively throughout the PNS tissues and in the spleen. The spatial expression patterns differed among trkA, and trkB and trkC mRNAs. trkA mRNA was greatly expressed in the DRG, sympathetic ganglia and spleen, while the trkB and trkC mRNA levels were high in the DRG, spinal cord and brain. The levels of trkB and trkC mRNAs with tyrosine kinase domain, compared to those with extracellular domain, were relatively high in the DRG, whereas they were low in the spinal cord and brain. The spatial patterns of the distributions of neurotrophic factors and their receptors mRNA levels in the adult human PNS and nonneural tissues are largely similar to those reported in other mammals, but these findings provide further, more specific, understanding relevant to the therapeutic approach to human diseases.","title":"Expression of mRNAs for neurotrophic factors (NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and GDNF) and their receptors (p75NGFR, trkA, trkB, and trkC) in the adult human peripheral nervous system and nonneural tissues.","pubmedId":"8895847"}
