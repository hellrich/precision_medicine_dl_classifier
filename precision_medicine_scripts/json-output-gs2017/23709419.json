EGFR (exons 18 to 21) and KRAS (codons 12/13) mutations were determined via direct-sequencing.\nThe incidence of KRAS mutations was 8% (16 of 200) in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. KRAS mutations were found in 5.8% (7 of 120) of tumors from never-smokers, 15% (6 of 40) from former-smokers, and 7.5% (3 of 40) from current-smokers. The frequency of KRAS mutations did not differ significantly according to smoking history (p\u003d0.435). Never-smokers were significantly more likely than former or current smokers to have a transition mutation (G→A or C→T) rather than a transversion mutation (G→T or G→C) that is known to be smoking-related (p\u003d0.011). In a Cox regression model, the adjusted hazard ratios for the risk of progression with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) were 0.24 (95% CI, 0.14-0.42; p\u003c0.001) for the EGFR mutation and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.58-2.79; p\u003d0.537) for the KRAS mutation.\nCigarette smoking did not influence the frequency of KRAS mutations in lung adenocarcinomas in Korean patients, but influenced qualitative differences in the KRAS mutations.","title":"The impact of cigarette smoking on the frequency of and qualitative differences in KRAS mutations in Korean patients with lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23709419"}
