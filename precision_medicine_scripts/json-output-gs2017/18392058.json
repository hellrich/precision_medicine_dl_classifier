This study examines the experience of a tertiary centre in alcohol-related facial fractures.\nA retrospective database of patients presenting to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service at Christchurch Hospital (New Zealand) during an 11-year period was reviewed. Variables examined include demographics, type of fractures, mode of injury, and treatment delivered.\n2581 patients presented with facial fractures during the study period, 49% of these being alcohol-related. Males accounted for 88% of alcohol-related fractures and 59% were males in the 15 to 29 year age group; 78% of alcohol-related fractures were due to interpersonal violence and 13% to motor vehicle accidents; 65% required hospital admission and 58% underwent surgery.\nThe majority of alcohol-related facial fractures were due to interpersonal violence, with young men in the 15 to 29 year age group being predominantly affected. Alcohol-related fractures were associated with an increase in the incidence of hospitalisation and surgery. The high prevalence of alcohol as a contributing factor to facial fractures indicates a need to push for community awareness and public education on the harmful effects of alcohol.","title":"Role of alcohol in maxillofacial fractures.","pubmedId":"18392058"}
