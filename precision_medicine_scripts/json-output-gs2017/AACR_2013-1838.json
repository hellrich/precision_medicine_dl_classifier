So far, nc886s best studied role is as a cellular RNA ligand and regulator of PKR (Protein Kinase RNA-activated). When nc886 is suppressed, PKR is activated and this activation leads to apoptosis through the canonical PKR-eIF2 cell death pathway. Given that the expression of nc886 was found to be suppressed in a variety of cancer cells, nc886/PKR\u0027s such role is thought to be critical in eliminating pre-cancerous cells during certain stages of tumorigenesis. Thus, nc886 plays a sentinel role against tumorigenesis by controlling PKR activity in some cells.We have found that nc886 is decreased also in gastric cancer. Our measurement of nc886 in 88 specimens from gastric cancer patients indicates that nc886 tends to be decreased in tumors relative to the adjacent normal tissues. Also, DNA methylation of the nc886 locus exhibits an anti-correlation to nc886 level, and therefore epigenetic silencing is likely to be the mechanism for the decrease of nc886 in gastric cancer. Moreover, hypermethylation of the nc886 promoter region is associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients. All our data indicates a putative tumor suppressive role for nc886 and the possibility of a clinical application for nc886 as a prognostic marker for gastric cancer.","title":"nc886, a putative tumor suppressive non-coding RNA in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-1838"}
