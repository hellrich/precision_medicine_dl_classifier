Reference lists were assessed for relevant articles, and guidelines were searched. Clinicaltrials.gov and meeting abstracts were queried for investigational agents. Eligible papers included those concerning EGFR biology, NSCLC or CRC studies involving EGFR-directed agents, and/or investigational drugs targeting EGFR and/or associated pathways.\nThe activity of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against EGFR has improved survival in NSCLC, and these agents particularly effective in cancers with an EGFR mutation. Resistance to TKIs is most commonly related to a second, T790M, mutation, or to MET amplification, with newer agents directed against these mechanisms. Conversely, in CRC, TKIs have been ineffective, whereas monoclonal antibodies have improved survival. Both primary and secondary KRAS mutations in CRC abrogate mAb effectiveness. Several targets, including MET, BRAF, and PI3K, may serve useful in combination with anti-EGFR drugs.\nExploitation of EGFR-directed therapies has offered improvement in survival and quality of life in NSCLC and CRC. New therapies directed at EGFR may offer further improvements. However, resistance mechanisms suggest that combination therapies or multitargeted agents will be crucial in making significant future advances.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor: pathway, therapies, and pipeline.","pubmedId":"24054705"}
