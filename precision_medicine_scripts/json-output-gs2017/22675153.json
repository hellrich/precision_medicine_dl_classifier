Only a few cases have been described until now. We present a case of recurrent dedifferentiated retroperitoneal liposarcoma in a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1).\nA 47-year-old Caucasian woman with NF-1 presented to the hospital initially complaining of left lumbar pain irradiating to the anterior thigh and knee. Physical examination showed atrophy of the lower extremities bilaterally and decreased motor strength on the left lower extremity. Radiological studies demonstrated an enhancing lesion in the left paraspinal region, suggesting malignancy. The patient underwent local resection of tumour with safety margins. Pathological examination was consistent with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) with positivity for MDM2 and CDK4 markers. No evidence of metastasis was noted on the radiological studies. The final diagnosis was DDLS, high-grade (G3), pT2bN0M0, stage III. After 6 weeks post-tumour resection, the patient experienced recurrence of malignancy. Chemotherapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin was initiated in the patient.\nLiposarcoma in the context of neurofibromatosis is very rare. To the best of our knowledge, only six cases have been reported until now in the literature. We are presenting this case to underline the possibility of recurrence in the case of retroperitoneal DDLSs despite local tumour resection. Also, although the role of chemotherapy is controversial we decided to start treatment with cisplatin and doxorubicin given the success of chemotherapy in similar case presentations.","title":"Recurrent retroperitoneal liposarcoma in a patient with neurofibromatosis type I.","pubmedId":"22675153"}
