Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, high amplification was defined by an FGFR1/centromer 8 ratio is ≥ 2.0, or average number of FGFR1 signals/tumor cell nucleus ≥ 6.0, or percentage of tumor cells containing ≥ 15 FGFR1 signals or large cluster in ≥ 10%. Low amplification was defined by ≥ 5 FGFR1 signals in ≥ 50%. FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations were assessed by direct sequencing in 388 cases and no mutation was detected. High and low amplification were detected in 8.6% and 1.1%, respectively. High FGFR1 amplification had significantly shorter disease-free survival (34.0 vs 158.5 months P\u003d0.019) and overall survival (52.2 vs not reached P\u003d0.022) than low/no amplification group. After adjusting for sex, smoking, stage, histology, and adjuvant treatment, high FGFR1 amplification had a greater risk of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.6; P\u003d0.029) and death (AHR, 1.53; P\u003d0.050). High amplification was significantly higher in current smokers than former and never-smokers (Ptrend\u003c0.001) and increased proportional to smoking dosage. High FGFR1 amplification is a frequent oncogenic alteration and an independent poor prognostic factor in resected ESCC.
