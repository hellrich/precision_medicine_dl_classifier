The incidence of MPM is increasing as a result of widespread exposure to asbestos. The molecular pathogenesis of MPM remains unclear. The present study analyzed the frequency of various genomic copy number gains (CNGs) in MPM using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A total of 83 primary MPMs and 53 primary lung adenocarcinomas were analyzed to compare the CNGs of EGFR, KRAS, MET, FGFR1 and SOX2. In MPM, the CNGs of EGFR, KRAS, MET, FGFR1 and SOX2 were detected in 12 (14.5%), 8 (9.6%), 5 (6.0%), 4 (4.8%) and 1 (1.2%) of the samples, respectively. In lung adenocarcinomas, the CNGs of EGFR, KRAS, MET, FGFR1 and SOX2 were detected in 21 (39.6%), 12 (22.6%), 5 (9.4%), 10 (18.9%) and 0 (0.0%) of the samples, respectively. The CNGs of EGFR, KRAS and FGFR1 were significantly less frequent in the MPMs compared with the lung adenocarcinomas (P\u003d0.0018, 0.048 and 0.018, respectively). Overall, the MPMs exhibited these CNGs less frequently compared with the lung adenocarcinomas (P\u003d0.0002). The differences in CNGs between the two tumor types suggested that they are genetically different.","title":"DNA copy number gains in malignant pleural mesothelioma.","pubmedId":"26722325"}
