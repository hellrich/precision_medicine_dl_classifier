Thus far, enlightenment on the downstream activities of Kras, the tumor\u0027s unique metabolic needs, and how the stroma and immune system affect it have remained untranslated to the clinical practice. Given the numbers of diverse therapies in development and a growing knowledge about how to evaluate these systems preclinically and clinically, this is expected to change significantly and for the better over the next 5 years.","title":"Genetics and Biology of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26226899"}
