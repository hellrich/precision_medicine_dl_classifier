In a 72-month period a total of 25 patients operated on for ICC were followed-up with postoperatively. Eleven right hemihepatectomies (8 extended), seven left hemihepatectomies (3 extended), one segmental resection, two bisegmentectomies (II + III), and four nonanatomical resections were performed. Median observation period was 2.7 (range: 0.2-6.9) years. Analysis focused on age, gender, tumor-size, operating time, histologic resection margin, Tumor-Node-Metastasis-stage, reoperations, postoperative complications, tumor recurrence, survival rate and a putative relation between p53 accumulation, ki67 index, MUC1 positivity, and prognosis. Mean tumor size was 6.49 +/- 3.93 cm. Eighteen patients (72%) underwent lymph node dissection. Major postoperative complications occurred in 10 patients. Seventeen patients (68%) showed tumor recurrence. Mean time to tumor recurrence was 6.7 (5.7-15.4) months. We found no correlation between p53 accumulation/ki67 index counts/Mucin 1 cell surface associated antibody (MUC1) positivity and ICC prognosis. A total of 13 patients died (52%) including one early and 12 late deaths. Mean time from surgery to death was 14.6 (7.4-30.9) months. Survival rate at 1 year was 84 per cent, at 3 years 57 per cent, and at 5 years 45 per cent. In our review only a small number of these 25 patients are indeed cured.","title":"Surgical treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma--a single center experience.","pubmedId":"20420253"}
