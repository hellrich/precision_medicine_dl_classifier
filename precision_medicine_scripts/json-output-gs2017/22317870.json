Issues of management and, most importantly, implication are yet to be elucidated. After a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma lifelong follow-up is recommended. Given the high recurrence rate and dismal long term prognosis of advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma this recommendation is more often than not moot. There are no clear guidelines or recommendations for surveillance designed for women with disease free survival greater than five years. This case presents a unique scenario of a woman with predictable disease that remains unpreventable.","title":"A surveillance conundrum: a case of 4 distinct primary malignancies in a BRCA-1 mutation carrier.","pubmedId":"22317870"}
