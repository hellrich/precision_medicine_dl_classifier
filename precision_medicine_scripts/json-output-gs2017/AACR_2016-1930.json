We investigated the hypothesis that normal cells with the KRAS-variant would be biologically unique.Methods: We created perfectly matched, isogenic normal breast epithelial lines with (MCF10AKRAS+/, MT) and without (MCF10AKRAS-/, WT) the KRAS-variant. We also created isogenically matched MCF10A cells with p53 gene-specific stable knockdown with (MLPKRAS+/) and without (MLPKRAS-/) the KRAS-variant. We evaluated phenotypic alterations in appearance, gene and microRNA expression and growth in the KRAS-variant vs the parental lines. We used 3-D culture on Matrigel (acini formation), and soft agar colony formation (anchorage independent growth) to evaluate growth and transformation. We also investigated EMT and stem cell analysis by performing targeted qRT-PCR, western blotting and flow cytometry.Results: We found that KRAS-variant normal breast epithelial lines (MT) exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype, exhibiting a spindle-like morphology vs the parental (WT) cells, consistent with a baseline epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In agreement with their appearance, MT cells had significantly lower E-Cadherin and Occludin, and significantly higher Fibronectin and Vimentin than the WT line. We also found that mir-200c was dramatically down-regulated in the MT line, being 828-fold suppressed. miR-200c has been shown to regulate EMT induction and self-renewal and proliferation of stem cells. We thus next investigated whether the MT line had an increased stem cell component. By sorting cells for CD44+/CD24low/ fraction and ALDH1 positivity, we found that MT cells had a significantly higher proportion of CD44+/CD24low/ cells, and higher levels of ALDH1positive cells. In 3-D culture, MT cells formed small irregularly shaped spheroids, whereas WT cells formed well-organized, polarized spheroids, supporting a mesenchymal phenotype. In the MLPKRAS+/ cells we also found a higher stem cell component, however we did not see an EMT phenotype. However, MLPKRAS+/ cells formed disorganized acinar structures, similar to transformed cells, while the MLPKRAS-/ cells formed single, normal round acini. We next plated these cell line in soft agar to test for baseline transformation. While the KRAS-variant normal breast epithelial cells were not transformed at baseline, MLPKRAS+/ cells exhibit colony formation in soft agar, consistent with transformation.Conclusions: These findings indicate that KRAS-variant normal cells are biologically different than cells without the KRAS-variant, but are not transformed. In contrast, p53 suppression in addition to the KRAS-variant is associated with cellular transformation, similar to findings with mutated KRAS. Studies are ongoing to better characterize baseline and oncogenic changes in the presence of the KRAS-variant.","title":"Impacts of the KRAS-variant on breast cell biology","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1930"}
