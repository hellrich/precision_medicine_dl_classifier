Herein, we examined the possible association of E318K and a novel variant of the MITF gene, V320I, with the risk of cancers of different sites of origin in a Polish population. We assayed for the presence of the E318K and V320I missense mutations in 4,226 patients with one of six various cancers (melanoma or cancer of the kidney, lung, prostate, colon, or breast) and 2,114 controls from Poland. The E318K mutation was detected in 4 of 2,114 participants (0.19%) in the Polish control population, the V320I in 3 of 2,114 participants (0.14%) in the control group. We found no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of the E318K and V320I variants among cases and controls. We found two carriers of the E318K variant among melanoma patients (P \u003d 0.95), one carrier among breast cancer patients (P \u003d 0.77), one carrier among colorectal cancer patients (P \u003d 0.82), and one carrier among kidney cancer patients (P \u003d 0.64). Our study demonstrates a lack of strong association of E318K and V320I with increased risk of melanoma or cancers of the kidney, breast, prostate, lung, or colon.
