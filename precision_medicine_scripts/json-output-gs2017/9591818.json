We discuss the history and present dogma regarding assessment of the regional lymph nodes and adjuvant therapy for melanoma. Of special interest is radiolymphatic sentinel node mapping of the lymph nodes and adjuvant interferon alfa-2b for thick primary lesions and stage III disease. We also discuss several evolving novel and innovative genetic immunotherapy approaches for patients with stage IV disease.","title":"Advances in melanoma therapy.","pubmedId":"9591818"}
