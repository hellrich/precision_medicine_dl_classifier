In Caucasian populations their annual incidence is 10 to 15 cases per million. Approximately 80% of GISTs have mutated KIT and 5% mutated PDGFRA. Most KIT mutations occur in untreated GISTs in the juxtamembrane exon 11 and only rarely in the kinase domain, whereas in imatinib-treated patients secondary mutations are frequent in exons encoding for the ATP/imatinib binding pocket or the kinase activation loop. Surgery is the standard treatment of local GIST. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is the standard treatment for metastatic disease with few exceptions. A majority (80-90%) of patients with metastatic disease respond to imatinib or achieve durable tumour growth stabilisation with continuous therapy using a daily dose of 400 mg to 600 mg. Treatment with imatinib increases survival of patients with advanced disease with a few years and is associated with only moderate toxicity. Imatinib is being evaluated as adjuvant treatment following surgery, and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors as treatments of advanced GIST.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).","pubmedId":"17018739"}
