Here, we review findings that associate MET expression and activity with a specific, genetically defined glioblastoma stem cell subtype, and data showing how MET sustains the stem cell phenotype in glioblastoma and other tumors. Finally, we discuss issues related to identification of tumorigenic clones driven by MET in the context of genetically heterogeneous tumors and strategies aimed at eradicating cancer stem cells.","title":"The MET oncogene in glioblastoma stem cells: implications as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target.","pubmedId":"23695554"}
