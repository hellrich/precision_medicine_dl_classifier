The positive rates of p53 in tissues of normal pancreatic and pancreatic carcinoma were 0 and 42.5% (P \u003c 0.05) respectively. Significant correlation was detected between the expression of p14(AR) and p53 and the diameter of tumor, the rate of lymph node metastasis, pathological grade, and clinic stage in pancreatic carcinoma. No correlation was found between the expression of p14(ARF) and p53 and the tumor infiltration in pancreatic carcinoma.\nThe tumor suppressor gene p14(ARF) and p53 are closely related to the occurrence and development of pancreatic carcinoma. It is possible to treat pancreatic carcinoma by gene intervention.","title":"[The relationship between tumor suppressor genes p14ARF and p53 expression and biological behavior of pancreatic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"12895341"}
