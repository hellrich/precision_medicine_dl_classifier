The role of miRNAs in outcomes in cholangiocarcinoma (CC) has not been reported.\nRNA was extracted from 32 resected CCs along with adjacent uninvolved bile duct epithelium. A total of 43 miRNAs were quantified using NanoStringâ„¢. Clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes were captured and compared. Overall survival curves were created using the Kaplan-Meier method; factors, including miRNA expression, were compared by log-rank, chi-squared or Cox regression analyses.\nAbsolute expression of each miRNA was compared with overall survival after excluding perioperative deaths (n\u003d 3). One upregulated (miR-151-3p; P\u003d 0.003) and one downregulated (miR-126; P\u003d 0.023) miRNA in resected CC relative to adjacent normal bile duct epithelium correlated with survival on univariate analysis. Clinical factors and these miRNAs were compared. Dysregulated miR-151-3p and miR-126, respectively, were the only factors that correlated with improved overall survival [41.5 months vs. 12.3 months (P\u003d 0.002) and 21.9 months vs. 15.1 months (P\u003d 0.02), respectively]. In eight patients, both miRNAs were dysregulated. In the remainder, only one or neither showed dysregulation. Concomitant dysregulation correlated with the best overall survival (58.7 months vs. 15.1 months; P \u003c 0.000; n\u003d 8); clinicopathologic factors in these groups were otherwise similar.\nIn resected CC, the concomitant dysregulation of both miR-151-3p and miR-126 was the factor related to the greatest improvement in overall survival. Further analysis of the targets of these miRNAs may yield potential therapeutic targets or prognostic biomarkers.","title":"Concomitant dysregulation of microRNAs miR-151-3p and miR-126 correlates with improved survival in resected cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23458262"}
