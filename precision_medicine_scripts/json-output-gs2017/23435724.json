VPA was also found to induce cell morphological change, with an increase of certain cell transformation markers such as snail1, snail2 and N-cadherin. Moreover, VPA could significantly up-regulate somatostatin receptor type II (SSTR2). Our in vivo study further demonstrated that VPA via inducing SSTR2 up-regulation extremely enhanced the anti-tumor ability of the SSTR2-preferential cytotoxic COL-SST conjugate in xenografts.\nVPA could not only suppress tumor progression but also provide a novel promising therapeutic choice in combination with a receptor-targeted cytotoxic conjugate via activating the specific receptor.","title":"Valproic acid suppresses cervical cancer tumor progression possibly via activating Notch1 signaling and enhances receptor-targeted cancer chemotherapeutic via activating somatostatin receptor type II.","pubmedId":"23435724"}
