The aim of this study is to know whether c-myc amplification can reliably discriminate these two entities.\nForty-seven patients treated for breast angiosarcomas were studied. Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with postradiation angiosarcomas after breast cancer treatment and 15 patients with primary angiosarcomas. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed by hybridization of probes covering C-MYC (chromosome 8q24.21) and CEP8 on tissue sections.\nAmplification (5- to 20-fold) of the c-myc oncogene was found in all breast radiation-induced angiosarcomas (32 tumours) but in none of the 15 primary angiosarcomas except one (7%).\nThis study reinforces that there are true pathogenetic differences between the two types of breast angiosarcomas which are morphologically indistinguishable. These data point the pathways preferentially involved in the pathogenesis of post radiation angiosarcomas of the breast and may provide the basis for an additional targeted therapy.","title":"Can c-myc amplification reliably discriminate postradiation from primary angiosarcoma of the breast?","pubmedId":"25863565"}
