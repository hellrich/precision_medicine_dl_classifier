One hundred five patients underwent pancreatoduodenal resection, 10 patients total pancreatectomy, and 11 patients local resection of the tumor. The site of tumor was ampulla of Vater (59), head of the pancreas (30), duodenum (20), and distal common bile duct (11). Six patients had benign disease. The operative mortality rate for radical resection for the entire period was 7.8%; it has declined to 5.4% since 1974. The operative mortality rate for local resection was 9.1% (one patient). The overall 5-year survival rate for all malignant tumors of the periampullary area was 28% and 25.5% for invasive adenocarcinoma. Survival was affected primarily by location and histologic findings. The 5-year survival rate for adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater was 37.2%, 27.5% for the duodenum, 16.7% for the distal common bile, and 4.3% for the pancreas (p \u003d 0.0001). Papillary adenocarcinoma had a 5-year survival rate of 49.2% in contrast to 18.4% for nonpapillary ductal adenocarcinoma (p \u003d 0.002). Patients with ampullary adenocarcinoma treated by local resection had a 5-year survival rate of 40.9%. These data justify continued use of a selective radical approach in the resection of most periampullary tumors with local resection for small tumors in high-risk patients.","title":"Results of surgical treatment of periampullary tumors: a thirty-five-year experience.","pubmedId":"3764694"}
