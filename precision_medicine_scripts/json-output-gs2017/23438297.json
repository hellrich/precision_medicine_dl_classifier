Histologically, these tumors were composed of diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas with brightly eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules or cork-screw or beaded bundles. Tumor cells showed pleomorphism, bizarre giant cells, and mitotic activity, but no necrosis. The cytoplasmic granules showed negativity on PAS staining. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells with cytoplasmic granular cells showed a positive reaction for GFAP. The cytoplasmic eosinophilic granules or bundles were positive for αB-crystallin, ubiquitin and HSP27. In addition, tumor cells showed strong cytoplasmic positivity for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-R132H protein in all cases. The MIB-l labeling index of these cases ranged from 7% to 10%. In cases 1 and 2, ultrastructurally, the tumor cells had electron-dense, amorphous structures in the cytoplasm and in the processes. These structures were bound to glial intermediate filaments. Based on these microscopic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings, case 1 was diagnosed as AA with abundant, mixed, common type of RFs and miniature (m) RFs, and cases 2,3, and 4 were diagnosed as AA with abundant mRFs. These results indicate that the presence of RFs in astrocytic tumors does not necessarily exclude a diagnosis of high-grade astrocytoma. In addition, AAs with abundant mRFs in elderly patients should be classified as a peculiar variant of AA.","title":"Anaplastic astrocytomas with abundant Rosenthal fibers in elderly patients: a diagnostic pitfall of high-grade gliomas.","pubmedId":"23438297"}
