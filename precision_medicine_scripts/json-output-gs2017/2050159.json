A distinction was made between true and coincident cancer. Histological features, therapeutic plan and survival rates are reported. In stage I treatment was mainly surgical, while in more advanced stages radiation therapy was applied. In 22.2% of cases combined surgical-radiation therapy was performed. The absolute 5-year survival for various clinical stages is as follows: stage I, 88.2%; stage II, 53.8%; stage III, 42.8%; stage IV, 0.0%. The overall absolute 5-year survival rate for all stages combined is 60.9%. Individualization of therapy can offer to the patient with cervical stump carcinoma a survival similar to the patient with cervical neoplasm with intact uterus.","title":"Cervical stump carcinoma therapy.","pubmedId":"2050159"}
