However, the underlying mechanism by which miR-424 played role in chemoresistance has been unknown. Here, in our study, to investigate the role of miR-424 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we have detected the expression of miR-424-3p and -5p in NSCLC tissues and paired normal control. Moreover, to explore the role of miR-424-3p in NSCLC cells, miR-424-3p and -5p were both re-expressed and knocked down using transient transfection with their respective mimics and inhibitors. Cell viability, migration, and invasion were evaluated using MTT, wound-healing and Transwell assays, respectively. It was found that down-regulation of miR-424-3p was pronouncedly associated with NSCLC progression and overall prognosis; and that both miR-424-3p and -5p were markedly capable of preventing the proliferation, migration, and invasion in NSCLC cells. Additionally, it is miR-424-3p but not miR-424-5p that enhances the chemo-sensitivity of NSCLC cells through targeting YAP1. Mechanistically, YAP1 was identified as down-stream target of miR-424-3p. Together, it was for the first time in our study found that it is loss of miR-424-3p not miR-424-5p that enables chemoresistance through targeting YAP1 in NSCLC, supporting that miR-424-3p could be used as therapeutic target in the curing of NSCLC with chemoresistance.
