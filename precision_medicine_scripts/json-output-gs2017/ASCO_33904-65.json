Our aim was to characterize the molecular and clinical outcome effects of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer (BC). Methods: We analyzed 173 BC samples for PIK3CA mutations. Corresponding gene expression profiles were used to understand its effects on the PI3K pathway. We validated a PIK3CA-GS in 2 independent BC cohorts (n \u003d 183) with known PIK3CA mutation status and evaluated its correlation with clinical outcome in 1748 BC samples stratified by treatment and subtype. Results: 26% of BCs had a PIK3CA mutation. Tumors with PIK3CA mutation demonstrated a distinct gene expression signature (p \u003d 0.03 after 1000 perm). In 2 datasets it could discriminate PIK3CA mutation carriers from wild-type (ROC 0.68, 0.71, p \u003d 0.001for both). However, the PIK3CA-GS was correlated with deactivation of the PI3K pathway probably through a negative feedback loop. This observation was supported by: 1) the PIK3CA-GS was significantly correlated with gene expression changes induced by PI3K inhibitors (Connectivity Map, Gene set enrichment analyses) and 2) the PIK3CA-GS was anti-correlated with a GS of PTEN loss (R \u003d -0.3; Saal et al, 2007). Higher levels of the PIK3CA signature were observed in HER-2+ and estrogen receptor positive (ER+), luminal BC subtypes. Whilst there was no association with mutation status alone and prognosis, increasing expression of the PIK3CA-GS (suggesting deactivation) was significantly associated with better clinical outcome in both untreated (p \u003d 0.04) and particularly ER+, luminal-B, tamoxifen only-treated (p \u003d 0.004) BC. Multivariate analysis (HR: 0.4; 95%CI: 0.3-0.7; p \u003d 0.002) confirmed that the PI3KCA-GS provided independent prognostic information. Conclusions: Paradoxically, the PIK3CA-GS correlates with inhibition of the PI3K pathway in ER+ BC and identifies a subgroup of luminal B BCs with a favorable outcome. The PIK3CA-GS may be a better indicator of PI3K pathway dysfunction than mutation status, potentially indicating patients who may benefit from combined endocrine therapy and PI3K inhibition.","title":"Correlation of PIK3CA mutation-associated gene expression signature (PIK3CA-GS) with deactivation of the PI3K pathway and with prognosis within the luminal-B ER+ breast cancers.","pubmedId":"ASCO_33904-65"}
