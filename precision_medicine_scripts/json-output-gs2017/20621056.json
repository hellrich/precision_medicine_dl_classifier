Therapeutic advances therefore necessitate the characterization of the cells that are able to propagate a tumor in vivo. We show an important link between tumor genotype and isolation of tumor-propagating cells (TPCs). Three mouse models of the most common form of human lung cancer each had TPCs with a unique cell-surface phenotype. The cell-surface marker Sca1 did not enrich for TPCs in tumors initiated with oncogenic Kras, and only Sca1-negative cells propagated EGFR mutant tumors. In contrast, Sca1-positive cells were enriched for tumor-propagating activity in Kras tumors with p53 deficiency. Primary tumors that differ in genotype at just one locus can therefore have tumor-propagating cell populations with distinct markers. Our studies show that the genotype of tumor samples must be considered in studies to identify, characterize, and target tumor-propagating cells.","title":"Primary tumor genotype is an important determinant in identification of lung cancer propagating cells.","pubmedId":"20621056"}
