In this multicenter retrospective study, we compared both the EGFR mutation frequency and patterns between familial and sporadic cases. The results explored that family history of lung cancer is an independent predictor for higher EGFR mutation rate in 1713 lung adenocarcinoma patients (Odd ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.06-2.67, P \u003d 0.028). However, the distribution of EGFR mutation subtypes was similar to that of sporadic cases. Part of our study involved 40 lung cancer families with at least 2 tumor tissues available within each single family (n \u003d 88) and there was no familial aggregation pattern in EGFR mutation subtypes. There were two families harboring the YAP1 R331W germline risk allele and EGFR mutation statuses among YAP1 family members also varied. These phenomena may hint at the direction of future research into lung carcinogenesis and EGFR mutagenesis.","title":"Higher frequency but random distribution of EGFR mutation subtypes in familial lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"27449093"}
