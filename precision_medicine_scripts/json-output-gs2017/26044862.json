In the present study, we discuss a novel treatment strategy that may benefit these patients. Human CD14+ monocytes treated with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)/receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB ligand (RANKL) differentiated into osteoclasts, whereas syringetin (SGN), a flavonoid derivative found in both grapes and wine, suppressed the osteoclastogenesis in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, SGN inhibited osteoclast formation induced by human lung adenocarcinoma A549 and CL1-5 cells. The associated signaling transduction pathway in osteoclastogenesis and SGN inhibition was found to be via the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Blocking AKT and mTOR by respective inhibitors significantly decreased lung adenocarcinoma-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, SGN regulated the lung adenocarcinoma-mediated interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts by suppressing the stimulatory effect of lung adenocarcinoma on M-CSF and RANKL production in osteoblasts, and reversing the inhibitory effect of the lung adenocarcinoma on OPG production in osteoblasts. The present study has two novel findings. It is the first to illustrate lung adenocarcinoma-mediated interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, leading to osteolytic bone metastasis. It also reveals that SGN, a flavonoid derivative, directly inhibits osteoclastogenesis and reverses lung adenocarcinoma-mediated osteoclastogenesis. In conclusion, the present study suggests that SGN, a natural compound, prevents and treats bone metastasis in patients with lung cancer.","title":"Syringetin suppresses osteoclastogenesis mediated by osteoblasts in human lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26044862"}
