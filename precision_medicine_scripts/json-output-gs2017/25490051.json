Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to determine if first- and secondhand CS induces localization of ubiquitinated proteins in perinuclear spaces as aggresome bodies. Furthermore, we sought to determine the mechanism by which smoke-induced aggresome formation contributes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-emphysema pathogenesis. Hence, Beas2b cells were treated with CS extract (CSE) for in vitro experimental analysis of CS-induced aggresome formation by immunoblotting, microscopy, and reporter assays, whereas chronic CS-exposed murine model and human COPD-emphysema lung tissues were used for validation. In preliminary analysis, we observed a significant (P \u003c 0.01) increase in ubiquitinated protein aggregation in the insoluble protein fraction of CSE-treated Beas2b cells. We verified that CS-induced ubiquitin aggregrates are localized in the perinuclear spaces as aggresome bodies. These CS-induced aggresomes (P \u003c 0.001) colocalize with autophagy protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3B(+) autophagy bodies, whereas U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved autophagy-inducing drug (carbamazepine) significantly (P \u003c 0.01) decreases their colocalization and expression, suggesting CS-impaired autophagy. Moreover, CSE treatment significantly increases valosin-containing protein-p62 protein-protein interaction (P \u003c 0.0005) and p62 expression (aberrant autophagy marker; P \u003c 0.0001), verifying CS-impaired autophagy as an aggresome formation mechanism. We also found that inhibiting protein synthesis by cycloheximide does not deplete CS-induced ubiquitinated protein aggregates, suggesting the role of CS-induced protein synthesis in aggresome formation. Next, we used an emphysema murine model to verify that chronic CS significantly (P \u003c 0.0005) induces aggresome formation. Moreover, we observed that autophagy induction by carbamazepine inhibits CS-induced aggresome formation and alveolar space enlargement (P \u003c 0.001), confirming involvement of aggresome bodies in COPD-emphysema pathogenesis. Finally, significantly higher p62 accumulation in smokers and severe COPD-emphysema lungs (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Stage III/IV) as compared with normal nonsmokers (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Stage 0) substantiates the pathogenic role of autophagy impairment in aggresome formation and COPD-emphysema progression. In conclusion, CS-induced aggresome formation is a novel mechanism involved in COPD-emphysema pathogenesis.
