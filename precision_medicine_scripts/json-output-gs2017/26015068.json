The purpose of the current study was to characterize the expression pattern of LKB1 and assess the clinical significance of LKB1 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. LKB1 mRNA expression which was analyzed in 32 PDAC lesions and matched non-tumor tissues, was downregulated in 50% (16/32) of PDAC lesions. Similar results were also obtained by analyzing three independent datasets from Oncomine. Protein expression of LKB1 was significantly reduced in 6 PDAC cell lines and downregulated in 31.3% (10/32) of PDAC lesions compared to matched non-tumorous tissues, as determined by Western blot analysis. Additionally, tissue microarray containing 205 PDAC specimens was evaluated for LKB1 expression by IHC and demonstrated that reduced expression of LKB1 in 17.6% (36/205) of PDAC tissues was significantly correlated with clinical stage, T classification, N classification, liver metastasis and vascular invasion. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were executed to evaluate the prognosis of PDAC and found that LKB1 protein expression was one of the independent prognostic factors for overall survival of PDAC patients.
