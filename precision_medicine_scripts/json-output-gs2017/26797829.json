The year of 2015 is the start of precision medicine. Colorectal cancer \"precision medicine\" is based on the analysis of the cancer genome sequencing and information analysis, interprets the mechanism of the occurrence, development, invasion, metastasis and recurrence of colorectal cancer, and helps to implement targeted individual treatment. The experts of the world\u0027s Colorectal Cancer Subtyping Consortium, integrated the past genetic testing based on the classification of colorectal cancer subtypes, refered to the indices of gene mutation, copy number, methylation, microRNA and proteomics, and coalesce the types of colorectal cancer into four consensus molecular subtypes(CMSs) with distinguishing features. CMSs may be the most powerful classification system of colorectal cancer because of its clear biological interpretation, and is expected to provide a reference basis for the establishment of clinical precision treatment system.","title":"[Future diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer from the view of precision medicine].","pubmedId":"26797829"}
