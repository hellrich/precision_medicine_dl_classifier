We have examined the expression of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) using competitive RT-PCR in 60 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and matching normal lung tissues. The intensities of bands for p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) were nearly equal or the intensity of the p16(INK4a) band slightly exceeded that of p14(ARF) in the normal lung tissues (n \u003d 60). In 38 tumors the intensity of the p16(INK4a) band was similar to or slightly weaker than that of p14(ARF). In 6 tumors the intensity of the p16(INK4a) band was weaker than that of p14(ARF). In 15 tumors the intensity of the p14(ARF) band was very strong and the p16(INK4a) band was barely visible. In only one tumor was the intensity of the p16(INK4a) band very strong, while the band of p14(ARF) was barely visible. The ratio of the intensity of p16(INK4a) to p14(ARF) had an interesting correlation with the tumor\u0027s clinicopathological characteristics. The p stage II - IV tumors had significantly lower p16(INK4a) to p14(ARF) ratios than the p stage I tumors (P \u003d 0.036). The T2 - 4 tumors had significantly lower p16(INK4a) to p14(ARF) ratios than the T1 tumors (P \u003d 0.005). The N1 - 3 tumors had significantly lower p16(INK4a) to p14(ARF) ratios than the N0 tumors (P \u003d 0.014). Our results suggest that the ratio of expression of p16(INK4a) to p14(ARF) tends to decrease during the progression of NSCLC.","title":"Ratio of expression of p16INK4a to p14ARF correlates with the progression of non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"12149144"}
