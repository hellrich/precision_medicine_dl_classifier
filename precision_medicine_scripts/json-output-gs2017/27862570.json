Melanoma-specific communication regarding family risk and screening may promote such behaviors. To this end, associations between patients\u0027 melanoma-specific communication and risk reduction were examined.\nMelanoma patients (N \u003d 169) drawn from a population-based cancer registry reported their current risk-reduction practices, perceived risk of future melanoma, and communication with physicians and relatives about melanoma risk and screening.\nPatients were, on average, 56 years old and 6.7 years\u0027 post diagnosis; 51% were male, 93% reported \"fair/very fair\" skin color, 75% completed at least some college, and 22% reported a family history of melanoma. Patients reported varying levels of regular (always/nearly always) sun protection: sunscreen use (79%), shade seeking (60%), hat use (54%), and long-sleeve shirt use (30%). Only 28% performed thorough SSE regularly, whereas 92% reported undergoing physician-led skin examinations within the past year. Participants who were female, younger, and had a higher perceived risk of future melanoma were more likely to report past communication. In adjusted analyses, communication remained uniquely associated with increased sunscreen use and SSE.\nEncouraging melanoma patients to have a more active role in discussions concerning melanoma risk and screening with relatives and physicians alike may be a useful strategy to promote 2 key risk-reduction practices post melanoma diagnosis and treatment. Future research is needed to identify additional strategies to improve comprehensive risk reduction in long-term melanoma patients.","title":"Communication about melanoma and risk reduction after melanoma diagnosis.","pubmedId":"27862570"}
