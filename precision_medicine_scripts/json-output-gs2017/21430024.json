Results were confirmed in 928 obese and 2738 population-based adults and 487 obese and 441 lean children. Abdominal sc adipose tissue was investigated in 202 subjects. We also investigated diet-induced, obese fasting, and fed rats.\nWe analyzed the association between FGFR1 SNP and obesity. In secondary analyses, we related adipose FGFR1 expression to genotype, obesity, and degree of fat cell differentiation and related hypothalamic FGFR1 to energy balance.\nFGFR1 rs7012413*T was nominally associated with obesity in all four cohorts; metaanalysis odds ratio \u003d 1.17 (95% confidence interval \u003d 1.10-1.25), and P \u003d 1.8 × 10(-6), which was P \u003d 7.0 × 10(-8) in the recessive model. rs7012413*T was associated with FGFR1 expression in adipose tissue (P \u003c 0.0001). In this organ, but not in skeletal muscle, FGFR1 mRNA (P \u003c 0.0001) and protein (P \u003c 0.05) were increased in obesity. In rats, hypothalamic expression of FGFR1 declined after fasting (P \u003c ]0.001) and increased after diet-induced obesity (P \u003c 0.05).\nFGFR1 is a novel obesity gene that may promote obesity by influencing adipose tissue and the hypothalamic control of appetite.","title":"Genetic association and gene expression analysis identify FGFR1 as a new susceptibility gene for human obesity.","pubmedId":"21430024"}
