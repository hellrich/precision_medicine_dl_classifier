Because 11q13 amplification is frequent in breast cancer, and PPFIA1 has been suggested to contribute to mammary gland development, we hypothesized that PPFIA1 might also be involved in the 11q13 amplicon in breast cancer and contribute to breast cancer development. A tissue microarray containing more than 2000 human breast cancers was analyzed for gene copy numbers of PPFIA1 and CCND1 by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization. PPFIA1 amplification was found in 248/1583 (15.4%) of breast cancers. Coamplification with CCND1 was found in all (248/248, 100%) PPFIA1-amplified cancers. CCND1 amplification without PPFIA1 coamplification was found in additional 117 (4.7%) tumors. Amplification of both PPFIA1 and CCND1 were significantly associated with high-grade phenotype (P \u003d 0.0002) but were unrelated to tumor stage (P \u003d 0.7066) or nodal stage (P \u003d 0.5807). No difference in patient prognosis was found between 248 CCND1/PPFIA1 coamplified tumors and 117 tumors with CCND1 amplification alone (P \u003d 0.6419). These data show that PPFIA1 amplification occurs frequently in breast cancer. The higher incidence of CCND1 amplification when compared with PPFIA1, the lack of prognostic relevance of coamplifications, and the fact that PPFIA1 amplification was found exclusively in CCND1-amplified cancers suggest that PPFIA1 gene copy number changes represent concurrent events of CCND1 amplification rather than specific biological incidents.","title":"PPFIA1 and CCND1 are frequently coamplified in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"19787783"}
