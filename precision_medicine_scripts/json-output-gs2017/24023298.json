We have previously shown that the expressions of tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are high in LCNEC and that TRKB/BDNF signaling is involved in the proliferation, tumorigenesis, and invasive nature of LCNEC. Therefore, TRKB/BDNF signaling may offer a potential therapeutic target for LCNEC treatment. In the present study, we evaluated whether the TRKB tyrosine kinase inhibitor, k252a, has effects on tumor regression and relapse prevention on LCNEC, using a murine xenograft model. The LCNEC cell line and NCI-H810 cells were subcutaneously implanted into the flanks or intrathoracically injected into the bilateral pleural cavities of BALB/c nude mice. k252a significantly inhibited tumor volume, expression of matrix metalloproteinases and the formation of pleural dissemination by LCNEC. These results suggest that k252a has potential for tumor regression and relapse prevention in LCNEC. Since many patients with LCNEC suffer through the use of ineffective therapeutic strategies, a clinical trial using the TRKB inhibitor for LCNEC is urgently required.
