A range of tumors, including subsets of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors harbor an ALK rearrangement that leads to oncogenic activation of ALK. Crizotinib has demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity against such malignancies through inhibition of ALK, and patients harboring ALK- rearranged NSCLC have demonstrated high response rates and prolonged progression-free survival in phase I and II studies. In August 2011, crizotinib was approved for the treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.","title":"Crizotinib for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22536569"}
