The following impacts on patient survival were assessed: i) preoperative serum CRP levels, white cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte count, platelet/lymphocyte ratio; and ii) post-operative pathology criteria including lymph node status and lymph node ratio.\nFifty-one patients underwent potentially curative resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma during the study period. An elevated preoperative CRP level (greater than 3 mg/L) was found to be a significant adverse prognostic factor (P\u003d0.015) predicting a poor survival, whereas white cell count (P\u003d0.278), neutrophil count (P\u003d0.850), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (P\u003d0.272), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (P\u003d0.532) and lymphocyte count (P\u003d0.721) were not significant prognosticators at univariate analysis. Presence of metastatic lymph nodes did not adversely affect survival (P\u003d0.050), however a raised lymph node ratio predicted poor survival at univariate analysis (P\u003c0.001). The preoperative serum CRP level retained significance at multivariate analysis (P\u003d0.011), together with lymph node ratio (P\u003c0.001) and tumour size (greater than 2 cm; P\u003d0.008).\nA pre-operative elevated serum CRP level and raised post-operative lymph node ratio represent significant independent prognostic factors that predict poor prognosis in patients undergoing curative resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. There is potential for future neo-adjuvant and adjuvant treatment strategies in pancreatic cancer to be tailored based on preoperative and postoperative factors that predict a poor survival.","title":"Preoperative serum C-reactive protein levels and post-operative lymph node ratio are important predictors of survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22406601"}
