Ceritinib is a novel ALK inhibitor that demonstrates significant preclinical and clinical antitumor potency, including in tumors that have developed resistance to the approved ALK inhibitor crizotinib. Upregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway may be involved in ALK inhibitor resistance, suggesting that combining ceritinib with a PI3K inhibitor may provide synergistic antitumor activity in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Here, we assess the synergy and antiproliferative activity of PI3K inhibitor/ceritinib combinations in crizotinib-nave primary preclinical models of NSCLC.Methods: In vitro experiments used the EML4ALK-translocated lung cancer cell line H2228 to screen for synergistic combinations of ceritinib with 18 other compounds (PI3K, MEK, and CDK4/6 inhibitors, among others). In vivo experiments used a human-mouse primary xenograft lung cancer model with similar EML4ALK translocation (LUF1656). Tumor fragments (diameter 23 mm) from stock mice inoculated with LUF1656 lung cancer tissue were harvested and used for inoculation into nu/nu mice for tumor development. Once mean tumor size had reached 150 mm3, treatment was initiated with single-agent or combination regimens of buparlisib (pan-PI3K inhibitor; 35 mg/kg QD), alpelisib (PI3K inhibitor; 30 mg/kg QD), or ceritinib (25 mg/kg [low dose] or 50 mg/kg [full dose] QD). All doses used were equivalent to known therapeutic doses in patients.Results: In vitro experiments revealed the strongest antiproliferative activity when ceritinib was combined with either buparlisib or alpelisib versus the other compounds tested. In vivo, low-dose ceritinib in combination with buparlisib improved tumor growth delay over single-agent, full-dose ceritinib. Full-dose ceritinib plus alpelisib showed no significant difference in tumor growth delay versus full-dose ceritinib alone. Low-dose ceritinib plus alpelisib appeared to be better tolerated than full-dose ceritinib plus alpelisib, but with similar efficacy to low-dose ceritinib alone. A delayed tumor growth rate after treatment interruption was noted in all ceritinib combinations.Conclusion: Synergy was observed between ceritinib and PI3K inhibitors in a crizotinib-nave ALK-translocated lung model in vitro. In the in vivo EML4ALK lung preclinical cancer models, low-dose ceritinib (25 mg/kg) combined with buparlisib showed improved efficacy versus full-dose ceritinib (50 mg/kg) alone. Preclinical experiments exploring combinations of PI3K- and ALK-targeted therapies in crizotinib-resistant ALK-rearranged tumors are also ongoing.","title":"Combination of ceritinib (LDK378) with PI3K inhibitors (buparlisib [BKM120] and alpelisib [BYL719]) demonstrates synergistic preclinical antitumor activity in ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4698"}
