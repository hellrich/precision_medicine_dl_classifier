He presented with painless jaundice and generalized pruritus and was found to have a pancreatic head mass. Whipple\u0027s procedure was performed and yielded the above diagnoses. Ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma, not a much rarer and more aggressive ASC subtype, has previously been shown to co-exist with GIST in some surgical series. In addition, the incidentally discovered GIST in our patient involved the stomach and not the small intestine, which is the predominant GIST location when concurrently diagnosed with other GI tumors. At the time of this publication, our patient, who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, remains disease-free 14Â months after the abdominal surgery.","title":"Synchronous tumors: adenosquamous carcinoma of pancreas and GIST of stomach.","pubmedId":"20623381"}
