To test this observation, we used sandwich arrays containing 98 autoantigens to compare autoantibody profiles of SLE subjects without DLE (DLE-SLE+) (N\u003d9), SLE subjects with DLE (DLE+SLE+) (N\u003d10), DLE subjects without SLE (DLE+SLE-) (N\u003d11), and healthy controls (N\u003d11). We validated differentially expressed autoantibodies using immunoassays in DLE-SLE+ (N\u003d18), DLE+SLE+ (N\u003d17), DLE+SLE- (N\u003d23), and healthy subjects (N\u003d22). Arrays showed 15 IgG autoantibodies (10 against nuclear antigens) and 4 IgM autoantibodies that were differentially expressed (q-value\u003c0.05). DLE-SLE+ subjects had higher IgG autoantibodies against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), histone H2A and H2B, and SS-A (52 kDa) compared with all other groups including DLE+SLE+ subjects (P\u003c0.05). Immunoassays measuring anti-dsDNA, -ssDNA, and -SS-A (52 kDa) IgG autoantibodies showed similar trends (P\u003c0.05). Healthy and DLE+SLE- subjects expressed higher IgM autoantibodies against alpha beta crystallin, lipopolysaccharide, heat-shock cognate 70, and desmoglein-3 compared with DLE+SLE+ and DLE-SLE+ subjects. IgG:IgM ratios of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens progressively rose from healthy to DLE-SLE+ subjects. In conclusion, lower IgG autoantibodies against nuclear antigens in DLE+SLE+ versus DLE-SLE+ subjects suggest that DLE indicates lower disease severity. Higher IgM autoantibodies against selected antigens in healthy and DLE+SLE- subjects may be nonpathogenic.","title":"IgG and IgM autoantibody differences in discoid and systemic lupus patients.","pubmedId":"22763789"}
