Local resection (LR) is a less invasive and potentially equally effective alternative for cancers with favourable prognostic features. Identification of these prognostic parameters may allow selection of patients suitable for LR.\nTwenty-five patients were treated for a primary Vater\u0027s ampulla adenocarcinoma at the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, between January 1989 and January 2000. Risk factors for cancer recurrence were evaluated and the specific role of LR was defined.\nFourteen patients had PD, five had LR and six had bypass procedures (five biliary stents; one operative bypass). Presenting symptoms included jaundice (64%), abdominal pain (54%) and weight loss (32%). Adenocarcinomas that were resected had a median diameter of 2.5 cm, and were limited to the ampulla in 26% (T1), invaded the duodenal wall in 42% (T2) and infiltrated 2 cm or less into the pancreas in 32% (T1) of cases. Locally resected cancers were confined to the ampulla or invaded the duodenum and recurred in one patient following excision. Six recurrences occurred in total, influenced significantly by T staging (P \u003d 0.009). Patient age, preoperative symptoms, laboratory tests, tumour size, differentiation, ulceration, lymphovascular spread and perineural invasion had no effect on recurrence. Patients undergoing LR had lower morbidity and mortality, reduced blood transfusion requirements and shorter hospital stay than those treated by PD.\nT staging predicts the risk of tumour recurrence and can be determined using endoscopic ultrasound. Local resection is a suitable alternative to pancreaticoduodenal resection in patients with T1 and T2 adenocarcinomas with a maximum diameter of 3 cm or less.","title":"Local resection of ampullary adenocarcinomas of the duodenum.","pubmedId":"11527262"}
