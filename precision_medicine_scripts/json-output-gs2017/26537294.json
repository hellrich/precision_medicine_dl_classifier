This is a diagnostic accuracy study of the Idylla system, a novel and automated alternative PCR system.\n100 consecutive formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded CRC resection cases were tested for BRAF mutations using the Idylla automated platform and compared with standard (Cobas) PCR.\nThe sensitivity of the Idylla BRAF test was 100% and the specificity was 96%. Only one discordant Idylla positive/standard PCR negative result occurred and on Droplet Digital PCR demonstrated a mutation not identified by traditional PCR in this case.\nThis study has validated the Idylla system for BRAF testing in CRC and demonstrated a possibly greater sensitivity, in addition to cost effectiveness and shorter turnaround time, when compared with standard PCR.","title":"Automated PCR detection of BRAF mutations in colorectal adenocarcinoma: a diagnostic test accuracy study.","pubmedId":"26537294"}
