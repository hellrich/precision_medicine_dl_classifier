Many tumor antigens, such as MAGE and gp100, are self-proteins; therefore, effective vaccine strategies must circumvent tolerance. We hypothesized that immunizing patients with subdominant peptide epitopes derived from HER-2/neu, using an adjuvant known to recruit professional antigen-presenting cells, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, would result in the generation of T-cell immunity specific for the HER-2/neu protein.\nSixty-four patients with HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast, ovarian, or non-small-cell lung cancers were enrolled. Vaccines were composed of peptides derived from potential T-helper epitopes of the HER-2/neu protein admixed with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and administered intradermally. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells were evaluated at baseline, before vaccination, and after vaccination for antigen-specific T-cell immunity. Immunologic response data are presented on the 38 subjects who completed six vaccinations. Toxicity data are presented on all 64 patients enrolled.\nNinety-two percent of patients developed T-cell immunity to HER-2/neu peptides (stimulation index, 2.1 to 59) and 68% to a HER-2/neu protein domain (stimulation index range, 2 to 31). Epitope spreading was observed in 84% of patients and significantly correlated with the generation of a HER-2/neu protein-specific T-cell immunity (P \u003d.03). At 1-year follow-up, immunity to the HER-2/neu protein persisted in 38% of patients.\nThe majority of patients with HER-2/neu-overexpressing cancers can develop immunity to both HER-2/neu peptides and protein. In addition, the generation of protein-specific immunity, after peptide immunization, was associated with epitope spreading, reflecting the initiation of an endogenous immune response. Finally, immunity can persist after active immunizations have ended.","title":"Generation of T-cell immunity to the HER-2/neu protein after active immunization with HER-2/neu peptide-based vaccines.","pubmedId":"12039923"}
