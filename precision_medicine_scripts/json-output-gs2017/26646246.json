Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed to detect ALK fusion genes, with validation of positive results using immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathological characteristics were collected to assess prognosis in ALK fusion-positive patients.\nOf 1407 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, there were 74 (5.3 %) ALK fusion-positive patients. Patients harboring ALK fusion were significantly younger (56.0 years vs. 59.8 years p \u003d 0.002) and were more likely to have advanced stages (stage III or stage IV) (OR 1.761; 95 % CI 1.10-2.82, p \u003d 0.017). Lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma was rarely found in ALK fusion patients (2.7 vs. 13.5 % p \u003d 0.025), while IMA (invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma) predominant adenocarcinoma was more frequently found (21.6 vs. 5.0 % p \u003c 0.001). ALK fusion was neither a risk factor nor protective factor in relapse-free survival and overall survival. Male, current smoker, and EML4-ALK variant 3 indicated poor prognosis among ALK fusion-positive lung adenocarcinomas.\nALK fusion was detected in 5.3 % (74/1407) of the Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma. ALK fusion defines a molecular subset of lung adenocarcinoma with unique clinicopathological characteristics. Different ALK fusion variants determine distinct prognoses.","title":"Prevalence and clinicopathological characteristics of ALK fusion subtypes in lung adenocarcinomas from Chinese populations.","pubmedId":"26646246"}
