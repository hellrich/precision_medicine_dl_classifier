Detection and surgical resection of gastric cancer in the early stage provides the only hope for improved survival in patients with gastric cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) with F-18 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has been shown to be essential in the evaluation of a variety of malignancies. However, conventional FDG PET has limited value for detecting a primary tumor of the stomach, mostly because of the relatively high levels of physiological uptake by the contracted stomach. We report 3 cases of primary gastric carcinomas detected successfully by FDG PET after the ingestion of food. The PET images of the stomach after ingesting food were compared with the routine fasting-state whole-body PET images for each patient. When the stomach was distended by food, the malignant lesions were more discernible. These cases indicate that gastric distension by ingesting food may be a simple method that can help to detect a primary gastric malignancy by FDG PET.","title":"Gastric distension by ingesting food is useful in the evaluation of primary gastric cancer by FDG PET.","pubmedId":"17242562"}
