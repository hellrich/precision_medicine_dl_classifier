Genetic factors contribute to the development of diabetes. Some forms such as the condition called maturity-onset diabetes of the young(MODY) result from mutations in a single gene. Other forms such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes are multifactorial in origin with different combinations of genes together with non-genetic factors contributing to the development of hyperglycemia. MODY has been a good model for studying the genetics and pathophysiology of diabetes. This form of diabetes can result from mutations in at least seven different genes: hepatocyte nuclear factor(HNF)-4 alpha/MODY1, glucokinase/MODY2, HNF-1 alpha/MODY3, insulin promoter factor(IPF-1)/MODY4, HNF-1 beta/MODY5, NeuroD1/MODY6 and Islet(Isl)-1/MODY7. Mutations in HNF-1 alpha/MODY3 are the most common cause of MODY in Japanese identified to date accounting for about 15% of cases of MODY. Mutations in the HNF-4 alpha/MODY1, glucokinase/MODY2, HNF-1 beta/MODY5 and Isl-1/MODY7 genes have also been found in Japanese; however, they are rare causes of MODY. Clinical studies indicate that patients with MODY are generally not obese and that all forms of MODY are characterized by pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Patients who have mutations in the HNF-1 beta/MODY5 gene have non-diabetic kidney dysfunction including renal cysts. Female carriers may also exhibit abnormalities in the upper vagina and uterus. Genetic approach for type 2 diabetes had done by using non-parameteric linkage analysis such as sibpair analysis which worked well and NIDDM1 and NIDDM2 have been identified to date. The responsible gene for NIDDM1 was recently identified to be Calpain 10, and SNP43 in this gene could explain all of the evidence for linkage in Mexican American type 2 diabetes.","title":"[Diabetes mellitus].","pubmedId":"11307309"}
