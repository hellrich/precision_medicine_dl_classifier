The NF1 and NF2 genes encode for neurofibromin and merlin, respectively. These 2 functionally unrelated proteins both act as tumor suppressor genes, possibly through modulation of the RAS/RAC oncogenic pathways. Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which these tumor suppressors act may allow for medical therapies for neurofibromatosis and may offer insights for cancer therapeutics.","title":"The genetic and molecular pathogenesis of NF1 and NF2.","pubmedId":"16818172"}
