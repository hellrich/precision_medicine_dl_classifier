This study investigates the associations between BRAF and K-ras mutations and clinicopathological, lifestyle and dietary factors in colorectal cancers.\n186 adenocarcinomas and 16 adenomas from the EPIC Norfolk study were tested for BRAF and K-ras mutations. Diet and lifestyle data were collected prospectively using seven day food diaries.\nBRAF V600E mutation was found in 15.6% of colorectal cancers but at higher frequencies in cancers with proximal location, poor differentiation and microsatellite instability (MSI) (all p \u003c 0.001). K-ras mutation (mostly in codons 12 and 13) was found in 22.0% of colorectal cancers but at higher frequencies in cancers of more advanced Dukes\u0027 stage (p \u003d 0.001), microsatellite stable (MSS) status (p \u003d 0.002) and in individuals with lower blood high-density lipoprotein concentrations (p \u003d 0.04). Analysis of dietary factors demonstrated no link between BRAF mutation and any specific dietary constituent, however, K-ras mutation was found at higher frequencies in individuals with higher white meat consumption (p \u003c 0.001). Further analysis of specific mutation type demonstrated that G to A transitions in K-ras were observed at higher frequencies in individuals consuming lower amounts of fruit (p \u003d 0.02).\nThese data support the model of BRAF and K-ras mutations arising in distinct colorectal cancer subsets associated with different clinicopathological and dietary factors, acting as mutually exclusive mechanisms of activation of the same signalling pathway.","title":"Dietary, lifestyle and clinicopathological factors associated with BRAF and K-ras mutations arising in distinct subsets of colorectal cancers in the EPIC Norfolk study.","pubmedId":"20233436"}
