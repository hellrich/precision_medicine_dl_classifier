The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinicopathologic characteristics and surgical outcome of patients with ICC. We retrospectively studied the records of 67 patients who underwent laparotomy for ICC from January 1995 through December 2005. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted for several variables to evaluate their influence on the outcome. Forty-five patients underwent hepatic resection. In 19 patients, the tumors were found to be unresectable at the time of laparotomy. Median 2- and 5-year survival rates in the 45 resected patients were 62% and 35%, respectively. For 36 patients who underwent curative resection, the 2- and 5-year survival were 67% and 41%, respectively; with a median survival of 43 months. The overall 5-year recurrence-free survival was 30%. The 90-day postoperative mortality rate was 4% and morbidity 28%. Multivariate analyses confirmed resection margin, lymph node involvement, blood loss, and blood transfusion to be independent significant variables for overall survival. Predictors of longer recurrence-free survival were lymph node involvement, vascular infiltration, blood loss, and transfusion. Surgical treatment of ICC by curative hepatic resection in patients without nodal invasion provides good long-term results. In contrast, incomplete tumor removal does not provide a survival benefit. An improved quality of preoperative staging was able to increase the resectability rate to acceptable 70%.","title":"Surgical treatment of mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: an 11-year Western single-center experience in 107 patients.","pubmedId":"19037702"}
