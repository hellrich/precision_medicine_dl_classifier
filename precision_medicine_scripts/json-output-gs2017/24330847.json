Here, we explored the mechanism of action of BNFA-D in breast cancer cells using multiple cell-based assays such as MTT, DAPI, FACS, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation. BNFA-D caused apoptosis by upregulating PTEN leading to inhibition of Wnt/TCF signaling cascade and arresting S phase in breast cancer cells. Expression levels of β-catenin, cyclin D1, C-MYC, and phospho-AKT (Ser(473)) decreased with simultaneous increase in the levels of GSK3β, CK1, and PTEN in BNFA-D-treated MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, silencing of PTEN in breast cancer cells reversed the phenomenon of Wnt/TCF signaling cascade inhibition after BNFA-D treatment.","title":"Induction of apoptosis by 4-(3-(tert-butylamino)imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine-2-yl) benzoic acid in breast cancer cells via upregulation of PTEN.","pubmedId":"24330847"}
