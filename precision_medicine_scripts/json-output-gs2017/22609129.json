However, current methods of analysis often become more complicated and costly with increased sensitivity. The high-resolution melting assay (HRMA) is a simple and rapid mutation scanning method with low cost and superb accuracy. In this study, we verified the accuracy of HRMA for screening KRAS/TP53 mutations in stool-isolated DNA from patients with colorectal cancer.\nComparing to direct DNA sequencing, the accuracy of HRMA was verified by detecting KRAS/TP53 mutations in 2 independent stages. In study stage I, both tissue and stool samples from colorectal neoplasm patients were analyzed. In study stage II, stool samples from patients with colorectal neoplasms, and normal controls in clinical screening settings were examined.\nIn study stage I, the HRMA identified 14 of 17 target mutations (82.4%) in stools from cancer patients, and 4 of 5 (80.0%) target mutations in stools from advanced adenoma patients. The mutation detection rate in fecal samples (45.0%; 18/40) and referred tissue samples (55.0%; 22/40) was highly consistent (Îº \u003d 0.79). The HRMA detected 1% mutant DNA in a background of wild type DNA. In study stage II, the HRMA assay detected 58.8% (20/34) mutations in tumor samples, 41.5% (17/41) in advanced adenomas samples, and 3.33% (2/60) in age-matched normal control samples. The results from HRMA and DNA sequencing revealed 100% sensitivity and specificity in both tissue and stool samples.\nHRMA is a simple, reliable, and sensitive method for detecting DNA mutations in the stool samples from patients with colorectal neoplasms.","title":"High-resolution melting assay (HRMA) is a simple and sensitive stool-based DNA Test for the detection of mutations in colorectal neoplasms.","pubmedId":"22609129"}
