There is no clear consensus on what type of adjuvant therapy should be used for patients with pancreatic cancer.\nOur objective was to retrospectively evaluate whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy using S-1 is clinically beneficial in managing resectable pancreatic cancer.\nPatients were divided into three groups: those undergoing surgery alone, those receiving gemcitabine infusion, and those receiving S-1 orally.\nOf 189 studied patients, the median overall survival was 15.0 months after surgery alone, 33.0 months in the gemcitabine group, and 45.0 months in patients receiving S-1. A multivariate analysis identified regional lymph node metastasis, positive surgical margins, and absence of adjuvant chemotherapy as independent negative prognostic factors. S-1 was not inferior to gemcitabine in terms of survival outcomes and showed a favorable hazard ratio compared with gemcitabine in the subsets of patients with positive vascular invasion.\nThere was no difference between adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 and gemcitabine in overall survival for patients with curative pancreatic cancer. Our results suggested that S-1 can be used as a second agent to gemcitabine after surgical resection for ordinary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.","title":"S-1 vs. gemcitabine as an adjuvant therapy after surgical resection for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"25104544"}
