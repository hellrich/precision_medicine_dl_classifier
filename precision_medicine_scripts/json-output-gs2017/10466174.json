Diet has also been implicated in the development of lung cancer, although the specific nutrients remain to be elucidated. Vitamins with antioxidant activity have received much attention. beta-Carotene, the most efficient provitamin A, was found to be inversely related to the risk of lung cancer in many prospective epidemiological studies, especially in studies measuring serum concentrations of beta-carotene. The findings from controlled trials, however, contradict the hypothesis that beta-carotene could prevent lung cancer, but rather suggest increased risk of lung cancer with supplementary beta-carotene. Data from both prospective studies and a controlled trial suggest no role for vitamin E in lung carcinogenesis. Some prospective epidemiological studies suggest an inverse relationship between dietary vitamin C and the risk of lung cancer, but due to the high correlation between dietary vitamin C and vegetable and fruit intake the independent role of dietary vitamin C is difficult to estimate. Studies using prediagnostic plasma concentrations of ascorbic acid do not support the involvement of vitamin C in lung carcinogenesis, and no controlled trials of vitamin C on lung cancer have been published. Thus, supplementation with antioxidant vitamins cannot be recommended for the prevention of lung cancer. Non-smoking is the most important target in the prevention of lung cancer. High intakes of vegetables and fruits may provide additional protection and are unlikely to be harmful.","title":"Vitamins and lung cancer.","pubmedId":"10466174"}
