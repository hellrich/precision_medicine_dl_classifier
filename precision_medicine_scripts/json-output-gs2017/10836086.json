With the reference to its incidence and mortality rates, lung cancer ranks among the most frequent human malignant tumors. Therapy procedures for lung cancer depend upon tumor histology type, stage of disease and patient general condition. The said parameters therefore determine the application of surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. In general, treatment results are usually rather poor, primarily due to lung cancer being the most frequently detected only as locally advanced or metastatic disease. Alike surgery, radiotherapy is a local form of treatment aimed at achieving local tumor control. This curative or palliative form of treatment is either applied alone or in combination with other treatment modalities. Irradiation is usually delivered by high energy photon beams from a telecobalt device or linear accelerator. The success of radiation therapy complies with the irradiation dose managed to be applied to tumor or tumor bed, which depends on patients general condition and site, size and spread of tumor. Radiotherapy with curative intent is applied in stage I, II and III non-small cell lung cancer patients with surgery being primarily applied in those with stage I and II. The efficacy of surgical treatment is to be improved by a combined-modality treatment. In stage III patients, who are more frequent than others, radical radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy is applied. Results of clinical trials report patients of relatively good general condition benefiting from combined-modality therapy. Palliative radiotherapy is to be applied in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. On the other hand, in patients with small cell lung cancer chemotherapy is the primary modality treatment. When the disease is limited to the lungs, the aim of radiotherapy is to optimize local control of the primary tumor.","title":"[Radiotherapy of lung cancer].","pubmedId":"10836086"}
