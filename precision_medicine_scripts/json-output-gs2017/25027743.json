The PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with patients\u0027 clinical response; 27 of 30 PIK3CA mutated patients had either a partial or complete response (p\u003d0.002). Multivariate analysis further confirmed that, after adjustments for age, disease stages and NCT cycles, PIK3CA was associated with clinical response (Odds Ration 0.126, 95% CI [0.029,0.691]). However, there was no significant difference between PIK3CA mutations in pathological complete response (pCR,7 /92) and non-pCR group. Furthermore, no EGFR, KRAS and BRAF mutations were detected in any of the 93 samples. Our data for the first time suggested that PIK3CA mutation status may be a predictor for better understanding clinical response to the combination of epirubicin and docetaxel NCT in patients with BC.","title":"PIK3CA mutations are a predictor of docetaxel plus epirubicin neoadjuvant chemotherapy clinical efficacy in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"25027743"}
