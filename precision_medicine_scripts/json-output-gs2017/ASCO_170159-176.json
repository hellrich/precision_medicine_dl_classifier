However, recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies have and continue to revolutionize cancer management, and are allowing us to reassess these ideas with data from comprehensive cancer testing. Methods: We report the management of a 57 year old man (non-smoker) with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with malignant pleural effusions harboring a concomitant EGFR p.L858R mutation and an ALK translocation. Mutational analysis was performed using Molecular Healths Engineus targeted Profile+ of 613 genes on a pleural effusion sample. ALK rearrangements were evaluated by FISH methods (Personalized Dx, CA). Results: The patient was initially treated with crizotinib and showed objective response for 9 months, with ECOG performance status of 1 prior to progression, at which time the treatment was switched to gefitinib. The decision to attempt crizotinib therapy first was aided by a lack of response to erlotinib in similar cases anecdotally. At present, several months after gefinitib initiation, the patient is stable and continues to be monitored. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first clinical case of a patient with concomitant EGFR mutation and ALK fusion to be treated with ALK inhibitor before EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). These rare cases continue to challenge current molecular testing algorithms that suggest EGFR testing first and ALK testing only if no EGFR mutations are detected. The management of patients with coexisting mutant EGFR and ALK translocation presents a challenge of what monotherapy should be given first, or whether combination therapy should be administered. In this case, ALK inhibition provided a durable response prior to EGFR inhibition. Since there is no consensus on the treatment of this subgroup, continued reporting of the management of these patients with outcome data is necessary to determine the optimal treatment options in patients with concomitant mutant EGFR and ALK translocation.","title":"Response to crizotinib and gefitinib in a lung adenocarcinoma patient harboring a concurrent EGFR exon 21 mutation and an ALK rearrangement.","pubmedId":"ASCO_170159-176"}
