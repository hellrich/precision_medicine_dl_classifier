A retrograde nerve tracer Fluorogold (FG) was injected into the gingiva (group 1) or applied into the gingival sulcus (group 2) of the first right maxillary molar to identify the neurons in TG that innervate the gingivomucosa. After 10 days TG were dissected and FG fluorescence in neurons was observed under UV light microscope. To draw a comparison, approximately 1000 neurons per ganglion from the entire TG (group 3) and approximately 350 neurons per ganglion from the maxillary region in TG (group 4), were analyzed. Expression of TrkA receptor in TG neurons was investigated by immunohistochemistry. About 70% of neurons in groups 1 and 2 contained TrkA receptor, which was statistically significantly more than in groups 3 (41%) and 4 (38%). FG-labeled TrkA-immunopositive neurons were predominantly small or medium-sized (less than 1200microm(2)). However, the neurons innervating the rat gingivomucosa were on average larger than the neurons in the entire TG or in the maxillary region. In conclusion, the majority of neurons in TG that innervate the rat gingivomucosa are small or medium-sized, contain TrkA receptor and are most probably nociceptive.","title":"Expression of TrkA receptor for neurotrophins in trigeminal neurons innervating the rat gingivomucosal tissue.","pubmedId":"17418945"}
