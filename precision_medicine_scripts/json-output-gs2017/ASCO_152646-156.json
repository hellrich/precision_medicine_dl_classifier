Modeling suggests that a twice weekly pulse dose, and daily low dose erlotinib schedule may delay the emergence of EGFR T790M. Pulse dose erlotinib may have superior central nervous system (CNS) penetration.  Methods:  We evaluated toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of twice weekly pulse-dose and daily low dose erlotinib in pts with EGFR-mutant lung cancers (NCT01967095). Using a 3+3 dose escalation, we assessed escalating pulse doses of erlotinib on days 1 -2 (D1-2), and 50mg low-dose erlotinib on days 3-7 (D3-7) weekly. Six pulse dose levels of erlotinib were tested: 600, 750, 900, 1050, 1200, and 1350 mg. Response was evaluated by RECIST 1.1. After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined, we treated an additional 10 pts at the MTD.  Results:  From Nov 2013 to January 2015, 34 pts were enrolled. Median age: 60; Women: 20 (59%); never-smoker: 23 (68%); EGFR L858R: 11 (24%) and Ex19del: 22 (65%). Three DLTs were seen: transaminitis (1050mg), mucositis (1350mg) and rash (1350mg) during the dose-escalation period. The MTD was determined to be erlotinib 1200mg D1, D2 and 50mg D3-7 weekly. In total, 16 pts were treated at the MTD. Treatment-related AEs were all grade 1-3. The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs (any grade) were rash (85%), diarrhea (79%), elevated AST (50%) and nausea (41%). Of the 16 pts treated at the MTD, 3 (19%) required a dose reduction of the pulse dose. Of 27 evaluable patients, 22 partial responses were seen (81%). Median-progression free survival is 11 months. 17 pts remain on study. 8 (24%) pts came off for progression, 7 (21%) for toxicity and 2 (6%) for non-adherence. Of those who progressed, 5/8 (62%) had EGFR T790M identified upon rebiopsy (none at MTD). Twelve pts (35%) had CNS disease at diagnosis; no pts came off study due to progressive or new CNS metastases.  Conclusions:  This kinetics-based EGFR TKI dosing schedule of pulse-continuous erlotinib was well-tolerated. TKI dose optimization may enhance efficacy. Further studies are planned in pts with brain metastases.
