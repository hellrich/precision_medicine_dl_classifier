To study the contribution of each pathway to the carcinogenesis of Barrett\u0027s adenocarcinoma, we analysed the alterations of p14ARF and p16INK4a in preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of this disease.\nAfter microdissection, DNA of 15 Barrett\u0027s adenocarcinomas, 40 Barrett\u0027s intraepithelial neoplasms (n\u003d20 low- and n\u003d20 high-grade) and 15 Barrett\u0027s mucosa without neoplasia was analysed for INK4-ARF inactivation using DNA sequence and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, restriction-enzyme-related polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.\nWe detected 9p21 LOH, p16INK4a methylation and p16INK4a mutations in Barrett\u0027s adenocarcinomas in 5 of 15 (33%), 8 of 15 (53%) and 1 of 15 (7%) patients, respectively. P14ARF was methylated in 3 of 15 (20%) adenocarcinomas. In Barrett\u0027s intraepithelial neoplasia, p16INK4a was altered in 12 of 20 (60%) high-grade and in 4 of 20 (20%) low-grade intraepithelial neoplasms. In Barrett\u0027s mucosa without intraepithelial neoplasia p16(INK4a) was methylated in one case (7%). P14ARF was intact in Barrett\u0027s mucosa without intraepithelial neoplasia.\nWe conclude that most Barrett\u0027s intraepithelial neoplasms contain genetic and/or epigenetic INK4a-ARF alterations. Methylation of p16INK4a appears to be the most frequent epigenetic defect in the neoplastic progression of Barrett\u0027s tumourigenesis.","title":"INK4a-ARF alterations in Barrett\u0027s epithelium, intraepithelial neoplasia and Barrett\u0027s adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"15185075"}
