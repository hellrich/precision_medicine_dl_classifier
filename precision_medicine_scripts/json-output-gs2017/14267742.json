Of the group in failure, 47.9% had rheumatic heart disease; none of these patients had been on chemoprophylaxis. Bilharziasis was associated with a considerable number of cases of hypertension and with a small percentage of cases of cor pulmonale. The authors feel that prevention of rheumatic fever and bilharziasis should constitute the corner-stone of any effective control programme of cardiovascular disease at this stage of medical development in Iraq.","title":"CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE IN WOMEN IN IRAQ.","pubmedId":"14267742"}
