However, iodine uptake in the uterus has not been well assessed. In this article, we systemically analyzed iodine uptake in the uterus and identified the site in which uptake occurred.\nSeventy-six female patients who underwent SPECT/CT from neck to pelvis were included in this study; 5 patients with uterine uptake received pelvic MRI. Iodine uptake in the uterus was diagnosed with SPECT/CT and compared with the findings of the MRI. Serum TSH level, administered dose of iodine-131 and number of radioiodine therapies were compared between the 2 groups with and without iodine uptake in the uterus.\nTwenty (26.3%) of 76 patients showed iodine uptake in the uterine cervix on SPECT/CT. It was difficult to distinguish the uptake in the uterus from that in the urinary bladder or rectum using only planar images. The patients with the uterine uptake were younger than those without (median age, 46.5 vs. 62, P \u003d 0.011). There were no significant differences in serum TSH level, administered dose of iodine-131, or number of radioiodine therapies between the 2 groups. In all instances of the 5 patients who underwent pelvic MRI, iodine uptake in the uteri was located in nabothian cysts.\nIodine uptake in the uterus is frequently found if pelvic SPECT/CT is performed. Nabothian cysts are a predominant cause of iodine uptake in the uterine cervix.","title":"Nabothian cyst a predominant cause of false-positive iodine uptake in uterus: comparison of SPECT/CT and pelvic MRI.","pubmedId":"24978344"}
