Conversely, KRAS mutations in these cancers confer resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. EGFR mutations occur almost exclusively in adenocarcinoma, and are more common in never smokers, women, and people born in East Asian (compared to Whites). No comprehensive studies exist of EGFR and KRAS mutations in lung cancers from African-American patients. Methods: We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material from 121 resected lung adenocarcinomas from African-American patients for DNA extraction. EGFR exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R point mutations were detected by sensitive mutation-specific PCR-based methods. KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutation testing was performed by mass-spectrometry (Sequenom)-based genotyping and direct sequencing. These data were compared to Memorial Sloan-Kettering data for EGFR and KRAS mutations in all resected adenocarcinomas in white patients. Results: EGFR mutations were detected in 23 of 121 cases (19%), while KRAS mutations were found in 21 (17%). Exon 19 deletions accounted for 18 of 23 of the EGFR mutations compared to 5 EGFR L858R mutations. KRAS mutations were primarily the transversion type mutations (17 of 21). When compared to data from Memorial Sloan-Kettering for White patients (81/273, 30%), the 17% rate of KRAS mutations in lung adenocarcinomas from African-Americans was significantly lower (p\u003d0.01). EGFR mutation status was similar between African-Americans and Whites (19% vs 18%, p\u003d0.9) and the proportion of exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations was comparable as well. Conclusions: This is the first large series reporting results of mutation testing in lung adenocarcinoma specimens from African-Americans. African-American patients are less likely than Whites to harbor KRAS mutations in their lung adenocarcinomas. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of EGFR mutations. Since biological characteristics underlie clinical factors, these differences may help explain differences in outcomes comparing African-Americans to other groups.","title":"EGFR and KRAS mutation status of lung adenocarcinomas in African Americans.","pubmedId":"ASCO_33034-65"}
