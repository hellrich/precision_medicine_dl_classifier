To assess the effectiveness of resection, we reviewed 185 cases of hepatic hilar cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed and treated at our hospital.\nThe clinical data of 185 patients with hepatic hilar cholangiocarcinoma who had been treated surgically from 1972 to 2006 were retrospectively analyzed.\nThe records of the 185 patients were divided into first stage (1972-1986) or second stage (1987-2006) according to the incidence of the tumor and its resection rate. Primary symptoms included upper abdominal discomfort or pain, anorexia, tiredness, weight loss and progressive jaundice. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) were first line methods for atraumatic diagnosis. If the patients displayed intrahepatic bile duct dilatation or were diagnosed as suffering from extrahepatic obstructive jaundice, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should be used. In this series, 87 patients underwent resection of the tumor (47.0%). Of the 87 patients, 43 received radical resection and 44 palliative resection. Fifteen patients underwent resection in the first stage and 72 in the second stage. A total of 74 patients were followed up after the resection. The median survival time of the radical resection group was 37 months and that of the palliative resection group was 17 months (P\u003c0.001). The other 62 patients receiving no resection died within 1.5 years.\nOnce patients are diagnosed with hepatic hilar cholangiocarcinoma, they should undergo exploratory laparotomy. Resection is the most effective method for the treatment of hepatic hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Diagnosis and surgical treatment of hepatic hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18086631"}
