Prognostic and predictive markers are needed, however, to identify patients amenable for these therapies.\nPrimary endometrial tumors were genotyped for \u003e100 hot spot mutations in genes potentially acting as prognostic or predictive markers. Mutations were correlated with tumor characteristics in a discovery cohort, replicated in independent cohorts and finally, confirmed in the overall population (n\u003d1063).\nPIK3CA, PTEN and KRAS mutations were most frequently detected, respectively in 172 (16.2%), 164 (15.4%) and 161 (15.1%) tumors. Binary logistic regression revealed that PIK3CA mutations were more common in high-grade tumors (OR\u003d2.03; P\u003d0.001 for grade 2 and OR\u003d1.89; P\u003d0.012 for grade 3 compared to grade 1), whereas a positive TP53 status correlated with type II tumors (OR\u003d11.92; P\u003c0.001) and PTEN mutations with type I tumors (OR\u003d19.58; P\u003d0.003). Conversely, FBXW7 mutations correlated with positive lymph nodes (OR\u003d3.38; P\u003d0.045). When assessing the effects of individual hot spot mutations, the H1047R mutation in PIK3CA correlated with high tumor grade and reduced relapse-free survival (HR\u003d2.18; P\u003d0.028).\nMutations in PIK3CA, TP53, PTEN and FBXW7 correlate with high tumor grade, endometrial cancer type and lymph node status, whereas PIK3CA H1047R mutations serve as prognostic markers for relapse-free survival in endometrial cancer patients.","title":"High-throughput interrogation of PIK3CA, PTEN, KRAS, FBXW7 and TP53 mutations in primary endometrial carcinoma.","pubmedId":"23219661"}
