Sixty-five patients who developed urinary disturbance after radiation therapy, radical hysterectomy or radical hysterectomy with radiation therapy for cervical cancer underwent urodynamic assessment. Those who underwent radical hysterectomy with radiation therapy experienced the most severe urine loss, as determined by the pad test. All patients showed markedly reduced bladder compliance. A beta2-agonist (mabuterol) significantly improved compliance, bladder capacity and flow rate. It is suggested that medication with mabuterol is a potential novel approach to the treatment of urinary disturbance after therapy for cervical cancer.","title":"Urinary disturbance after therapy for cervical cancer: urodynamic evaluation and beta2-agonist medication.","pubmedId":"10614971"}
