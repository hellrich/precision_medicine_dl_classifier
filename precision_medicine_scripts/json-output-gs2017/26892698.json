We describe a case of clinical activity of crizotinib in a female patient with a lung adenocarcinoma displaying a MET exon 14 donor splice site mutation (D1028N) detected using next generation sequencing. Within 5 weeks of crizotinib therapy, a partial response was observed in this 67 year-old woman. Further clinical trials of crizotinib are needed for non-small cell lung cancer exhibiting MET mutations.
