The prevalence of EGFR mutation is high in Asian lung adenocarcinoma patients. The difference of clinical outcome of stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients with or without activating EGFR mutation was unclear. Our aim of study is to evaluate the clinical outcome between wild and mutated stage I lung adenocarcinoma.Patients and Methods: We had 343 Stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients who received surgical resection from January 2010 to April 2014. The preliminary data of EGFR mutation in 167 patients was done. Sanger method of direct PCR, scorpion \u0026 ARMS method or ABI allele specific TagMan PCR were used to check the EGFR mutation status of these patients’ samples. The selection of these methods was depended on purity of tumor samples.Results: There were 93 stage IA patients and 74 stage IB patients. Sixty-four (69%) patients had activating EGFR mutations in stage IA patients, and fifty (68%) patients had activating EGFR mutations in stage IB patients. The survival of stage IA and IB were similar in patients with or without EGFR mutations. The patients without mutated EGFR had better progression free survival in IA and IB patients, especially in the IB patients, although the significance did not be reached in small preliminary sample size.Conclusion: The survival was similar in stage IA or IB lung adenocarcinoma with or without EGFR mutations. Patient without EGFR mutation had better progression free survival although there was no statistical significance between patients with or without EGFR mutations. We will collect more patients’ data for analysis.","title":"The clinical outcome of stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients with or without activating EGFR mutation.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-1769"}
