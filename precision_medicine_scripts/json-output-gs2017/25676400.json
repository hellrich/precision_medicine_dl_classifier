While FISH showed 23 cases with EML4-ALK fusion gene mutation, the detection rate was 20%, slightly lower than the ARMS detection results, suggesting that ARMS more sensitive.\nThe application of IHC, ARMS fluorescence quantitative PCR and FISH technology can make a rapid and accurate evaluation of EML4-ALK gene fusion.\n背景与目的 非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）是肺癌的主要类型，相关位点突变检测研究已经成为肺癌分子靶向治疗的热门方向，研究NSCLC肿瘤组织中动物微管相关蛋白4与间变性淋巴瘤激酶融合基因（echinodem microtubule associated protein like 4-Anaplastic lymphoma kinase, EML4-ALK）与表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）的基因突变状态，比较免疫组织化学（immunohistochemistry, IHC）与蝎形探针扩增阻滞突变系统（Scorpions amplification refractory mutation system, Scorpions ARMS）荧光定量PCR与荧光原位杂交（fluorescence in situ hybridization, FISH）检测EML4-ALK融合基因与EGFR基因突变的敏感性。方法 应用IHC、ARMS荧光定量PCR及FISH技术检测85例NSCLC石蜡包埋肿瘤组织以及癌旁正常肺组织中EML4-ALK融合基因状态，并应用ARMS方法检测EGFR基因第18、19、20和21外显子突变状态。结果 115例NSCLC中IHC显示32例有ALK（D5F3）表达，表达率为27.8%；ARMS检测27例存在EML4-ALK融合基因突变，突变检出率为23.5%；53例检出EGFR突变，突变率为46%。而FISH检测23例存在EML4-ALK融合基因突变，检出率为20%，稍低于ARMS检测结果，提示ARMS的敏感度更高。结论 联合运用IHC/ARMS荧光定量PCR/FISH技术能够对EML4-ALK融合基因状态做出快速、准确评价。","title":"[Analysis of EML4-ALK gene fusion mutation in patients \u2029with non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"25676400"}
