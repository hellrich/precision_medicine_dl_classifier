He was initially diagnosed with diabetic peripheral neuropathy based on a symptom questionnaire and a quantitative sensory test. Despite symptomatic treatment of diabetic neuropathy, he complained of worsening sensory symptoms and additional motor weakness in both lower extremities. As the motor weakness of both extremities became more aggravated over time, brain and spine imaging tests and a nerve conduction test were performed. The nerve conduction study revealed motor and sensory axonal neuropathy. In his cerebrospinal analysis, albumino-cytologic dissociation, which is compatible to the Gillian-Barre syndrome, was found. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed albumino-cytologic dissociation. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and his neurologic deficits were gradually improved.","title":"A case of diabetic neuropathy combined with Guillain-Barre syndrome.","pubmedId":"20526398"}
