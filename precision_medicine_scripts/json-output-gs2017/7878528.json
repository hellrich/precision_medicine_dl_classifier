All clinicopathologic data and their influence on survival were studied.\nSubtotal pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in 62 of 67 patients with a mortality of 6% and a morbidity of 65%; the remaining five patients underwent total pancreaticoduodenectomy. Intraabdominal infection was the most important complication. Resection margins were tumor free in 75% of 67 patients. The overall 5-year survival was 50%. Survival was significantly influenced by the involvement of resection margins. After resection with involved margins 5-year survival was 15% and 60% after resection with free margins (p \u003c 0.001). Tumor size, lymph node involvement, and differentiation grade had limited and not significant influence on survival.\nSubtotal pancreaticoduodenectomy is the type of resection of first choice for ampullary carcinoma. Involvement of resection margins was the strongest prognostic factor for survival. Patients with a tumor size larger than 2 cm, with lymph node involvement, or with a poorly differentiated tumor still had a 5-year survival rate greater than 40%. Patients with involved margins might be candidates for studies on adjuvant therapy.","title":"Results of pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary carcinoma and analysis of prognostic factors for survival.","pubmedId":"7878528"}
