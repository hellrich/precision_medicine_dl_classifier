Still, serious differential diagnostic problems may arise because of the heterogeneity of these tumors in both morphologic appearance and clinical behavior. In our case, we present a metastatic, ulcerative, hemorrhagic GIST with epithelioid appearance, which displayed diffuse pan cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) positivity beside CD117 expression. As carcinomas may also be CD117-positive, definitive diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of a hexanucleotide deletion in the exon 11 of c-kit. This case demonstrates that although gastric carcinoma more commonly ulcerates or causes hemorrhage than GIST, keratin-positive GIST should also be considered from a differential diagnostic point of view. In these cases, c-kit mutation analysis may be necessary.","title":"Keratin-positive gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach mimicking gastric carcinoma: diagnosis confirmed by c-kit mutation analysis.","pubmedId":"18382354"}
