Although they are rarely found in the greater omentum, when they occur in that area they can become enormous and be mistaken for pancreatic pseudocysts or ascitic distension. Recently, successful resection of a 10--kg liposarcoma of the omentum was performed at our institution. A description of the clinical presentation, preoperative assessment, and characteristics of this tumor are reported and the literature is surveyed. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy for these tumors is also discussed.","title":"Primary liposarcoma of the omentum.","pubmedId":"678097"}
