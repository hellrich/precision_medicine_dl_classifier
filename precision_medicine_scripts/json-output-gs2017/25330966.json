Without the ability to sample on the meaningful large-scale conformational changes, the ability to infer biological function and to understand the effect of mutations and changes in environment is not possible. Our Dynamic Importance Sampling method (DIMS), part of the CHARMM simulation package, is a method that enables sampling over ensembles of transition intermediates. This chapter outlines the context for the method and the usage within the program. ","title":"Computing ensembles of transitions with molecular dynamics simulations.","pubmedId":"25330966"}
