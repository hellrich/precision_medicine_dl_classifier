They are now recognized as a distinct entity with origin in the mesodermal interstitial cell of Cajal, cells that express the c-KIT protein (tirozine kinase receptor). The definitive diagnosis is established by immunohistochemistry, more than 95% of GISTs being positive for CD117. Despite the major progress of chemotherapy, the treatment of choice is surgery, and it implies the complete resection of the tumor. The evolution of these tumors is unpredictable and the prognosis depends on localization, tumor size and mitotic index. Benign tumors have an excellent prognosis after surgery, with a 5 year survival of 90%, while malignant tumors resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy have a dismal prognosis even after surgical resection, with a median survival of 1 year. We studied a group of 15 patients diagnosed with TSGI in the Surgery Clinic of the ÂœProf. Dr. Agrippa Ionescu Clinical Emergency Hospital, between 2003 and 2013, following the particularities of presentation, diagnosis and treatment, with focus on the prognostic factors according to available literature data.
