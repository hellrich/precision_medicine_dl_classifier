The medical records of 83 patients were carefully reviewed. 45 patients who received second-line EGFR TKIs followed by third-line pemetrexed were grouped as cohort A. 38 patients who received a strategy with the reverse sequence were grouped as cohort B. Progression-free survival, disease control duration and survival time were compared between the two cohorts.\nMedian survival time is significantly longer in cohort A compared with cohort B (23.615 months vs. 16.269 months, HR: 0.549, 95% CI: 0.308-0.979, P \u003d 0.042). Median disease control duration is 17.463 months in cohort A versus 11.587 months in cohort B (HR: 0.700, 95% CI: 0.409-1.196, P \u003d 0.191). Median progression-free survival with second-line EGFR TKIs is significantly longer than second-line pemetrexed (8.056 months vs. 4.200 months, HR: 0.462, 95% CI: 0.281-0.758, P \u003d 0.001). Median progression-free survival with third-line EGFR TKIs is 6.885 months versus 7.624 months with third-line pemetrexed (HR: 0.462, 95% CI: 0.605-1.767, P \u003d 0.902). The rate of response to EGFR TKIs is higher in second-line setting than in third-line (44% vs. 34%).\nWe hypothesized that for EGFR-mutated patients, second-line EGFR TKIs followed by third-line pemetrexed is preferable to the reverse sequence.","title":"Second-line epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors followed by third-line pemetrexed or the reverse sequence: a retrospective analysis of 83 Chinese patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22116317"}
