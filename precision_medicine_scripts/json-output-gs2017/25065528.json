Trastuzumab, the first Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted therapy for breast cancer, established the era of personalized treatment for HER2+ metastatic disease. It is well tolerated and improves overall survival and time-to-disease progression; with chemotherapy, it is part of the standard of care for patients with HER2+ metastatic disease. However, many patients do not benefit from it because of resistance. Substantial research has been performed to understand the mechanism of trastuzumab resistance and develop combination strategies to overcome the resistance. In this review, we provide insight into the current pipeline of drugs used in combination with trastuzumab and the degree to which these combinations have been evaluated, especially in patients who have experienced disease progression on trastuzumab. We conclude with a discussion of the current challenges and future therapeutic approaches to trastuzumab-based combination therapy.
