Based on the results from several phase III studies and 2 meta-analyses, the use of concomitant chemoradiation therapy (ChRT) could significantly improve overall survival and is considered the standard of care in LA-NSCLC with good performance status. Currently, no evidence has shown a significant survival benefit of third-generation regimens applied in combination with ChRT compared with second-generation regimens. For regimens concomitant with radiation therapy, full-dose chemotherapy (such as cisplatin and etoposide or cisplatin and vinblastine) might be preferred. Additional full-dose consolidation paclitaxel-carboplatin is recommended when patients receive weekly paclitaxel-carboplatin ChRT. Effective novel chemotherapy agents or targeted therapies are required to further improve the outcome of patients with LA-NSCLC. In addition, personalized medicine concomitant with radiation therapy is a promising approach. However, little evidence exists concerning the effectiveness of this novel approach.
