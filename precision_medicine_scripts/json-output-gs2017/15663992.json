The widespread use of prostate-specific (PSA) assay has lead to earlier diagnosis and earlier detection of recurrent disease. This means that the systemic side effects of androgen deprivation and quality of life have become more important. Debates continue regarding the proper use and timing of endocrine therapy with orchiectomy, oestrogen agonists, gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, GnRH antagonists, and androgen antagonists. A critical review of the literature was performed. Data support that androgen deprivation is an effective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer. However, although it improves survival, it is not curative, and creates a spectrum of unwanted effects that influence quality of life. Castration remains the frontline treatment for metastatic prostate cancer, where orchiectomy, oestrogen agonists and GnRH agonists produce equivalent clinical responses. Maximum androgen blockade (MAB) is not significantly more effective than single agent GnRH agonist or orchiectomy. Nonsteroidal antiandrogen monotherapy is as effective as castration in treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer offering quality of life benefits. Adjuvant endocrine treatment is able to delay disease progression at any stage. There is, however, controversy of the possible survival benefit of such treatment, including patients having PSA relapse after definitive local treatment for prostate cancer. Neoadjuvant endocrine treatment has its place mainly in the external beam radiotherapy setting. Intermittent androgen blockade is still considered experimental. The decision regarding the type of androgen deprivation should be made individually after informing the patient of all available treatment options, including watchful waiting, and on the basis of potential benefits and adverse effects. Several large studies are under way to investigate the role of adjuvant endocrine treatment in the field of early prostate cancer, intermittent androgen deprivation and endocrine therapy alone compared with endocrine therapy with radiotherapy. The real challenge, however, is to develop better means to avert hormone-refractory prostate cancer and better treatments for patients with hormone-refractory disease when it occurs.","title":"Endocrine treatment of prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"15663992"}
