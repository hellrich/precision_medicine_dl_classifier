The gene maps on chromosome 22q11, in a region commonly deleted in severe congenital disorders such as DiGeorge (DGS) and velo-cardio-facial (VCFS) syndromes. UFD1L is a single copy gene ubiquitously expressed in high levels in the pharyngeal pouches and fourth branchial arch artery during development. To understand the regulation of UFD1L expression we performed a functional analysis of its 5\u0027 regulatory region. 5\u0027-RACE and primer extension analyses revealed the presence of different transcription start sites in adult and fetal tissues. UFD1L 5\u0027 flanking region contains a TATA-box motif and is also very GC-rich with a CpG island encompassing exon 1. Transcriptional activity of this region was examined by transfection experiments of promoter-GFP reporter gene constructs in a human epithelial cell line. These experiments revealed the importance of the region between -17 and -463 nt which contains the TATA-box. EMSA assay resulted in the detection of five functional consensus sequences respectively for the transcription complex TFIID and for the transcription factors AP-1 (one site), AP-2 (one) and Sp1 (two).","title":"Functional characterization of the 5\u0027 flanking region of human ubiquitin fusion degradation 1 like gene (UFD1L).","pubmedId":"11979512"}
