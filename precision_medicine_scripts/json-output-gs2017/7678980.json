Expression of mRNA was detected by Northern blotting, and c-met and c-kit protein expression was detected by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. c-met and c-kit mRNA was expressed in 22 of the examined cell lines or xenografts, and coexpression of the two proto-oncogenes was observed in 20 tumours. Expression of c-met and c-kit protein paralleled in the mRNA expression. HGF/SF mRNA was expressed in two of the examined tumours, and only one of these also expressed the c-met proto-oncogene. SCF mRNA was expressed in 19 of the examined tumours, and in 18 of these coexpression of c-kit and SCF was present. The high percentage of SCLC tumours expressing c-met and c-kit indicates that these proto-oncogenes may have an important function in this disease. The rare coexpression of c-met and HGF/SF is evidence that an autocrine regulatory pathway is not present for this receptor/ligand system in SCLC, while the frequent coexpression of c-kit and SCF indicates that this receptor/ligand system may have an autocrine function in SCLC.","title":"Expression of the proto-oncogenes c-met and c-kit and their ligands, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor and stem cell factor, in SCLC cell lines and xenografts.","pubmedId":"7678980"}
