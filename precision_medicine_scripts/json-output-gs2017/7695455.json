We studied the levels of awareness, treatment, and control of these conditions in US population samples during a 3-year period (1987 to 1989).\nThe levels of awareness, treatment (by medication), and adequate control of hypertension (systolic blood pressure, \u003e or \u003d 140 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure, \u003e or \u003d 90 mm Hg; or antihypertensive medication) and hypercholesterolemia (serum cholesterol level, \u003e or \u003d 6.21 mmol/L [\u003e or \u003d 240 mg/dL], or lipid-lowering medication) were studied among participants in the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, including 15,739 individuals aged 45 to 64 years.\nEighty-four percent of the hypertensive subjects and 42% of the hypercholesterolemic subjects were aware of their conditions. Overall, 50% of the hypertensive subjects and only 4% of the hypercholesterolemic subjects had their conditions both treated and controlled. Rates of hypertension prevalence, awareness, and control remained stable during the 3-year study period. Hypercholesterolemia prevalence decreased from 30% in 1987 to 25% in 1989; its awareness increased from 31% to 50% during the same period. Hypertensive women were more likely than hypertensive men to be aware and treated, whereas hypercholesterolemia awareness was higher in men than in women. Hypertension awareness was highest in black women, but black hypertensive subjects were less likely than whites to be treated and to have their hypertension controlled. Black hypercholesterolemic subjects were less likely to be either aware or treated.\nAfter the recent implementation of the National Cholesterol Education Program, the levels of awareness, treatment, and control of hypercholesterolemia are improving at a high rate, although they are still substantially lower than those for hypertension. Further improvement is necessary, particularly among certain population groups, such as blacks.","title":"Population awareness and control of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
