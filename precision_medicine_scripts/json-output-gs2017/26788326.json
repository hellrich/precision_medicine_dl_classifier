NRAS p.Q61K mutations with GNAS p.R201H mutations are known for a good radioactive iodine treatment response.Further exploration of the GNAS-activating pathway may provide therapeutic insights into the treatment of metastatic follicular carcinoma.","title":"Follicular thyroid carcinoma with NRAS Q61K and GNAS R201H mutations that had a good (131)I treatment response.","pubmedId":"26788326"}
