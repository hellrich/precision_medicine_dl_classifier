It is expressed in normal breast and prostate tissue but is downregulated or absent in breast and prostate tumors. Recent reports have shown that decreased expression is associated with a greater propensity for metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinomas. We know that some high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia progress to invasive carcinomas while others either persist at the same degree of atypia or regress. The pattern of maspin expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-grade 3, microinvasive squamous carcinomas and overtly invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix was studied to determine the relationship between the extent of maspin expression and the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia to squamous cell carcinoma. In total, 36 cases were evaluated: 18 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-grade 3, seven cases of microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma and 11 cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma. A monoclonal antibody was used on paraffin-embedded tissues. Immunoreactivity was scored semiquantitatively using a scale of 0-3. The sums of the scores of the different groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. A significant decrease in maspin scores was noted between cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-grade 3 vs invasive squamous cell carcinoma (P\u003c0.005), microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma vs invasive squamous cell carcinoma (P\u003c0.05), and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-grade 3 vs tumor emboli (P\u003c0.005). Although not statistically significant, scores of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-grade 3 associated with invasive squamous cell carcinoma were lower compared to that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-grade 3 without invasive squamous cell carcinoma. These findings suggest that maspin likely plays a role in disease progression from in situ to invasive carcinoma. Virtual absence of maspin immunopositivity in tumor emboli indicates that maspin may also play a role in metastasis.","title":"Maspin expression in CIN 3, microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma, and invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.","pubmedId":"15731774"}
