Although hospice was used more commonly in the retrospective versus prospective cohort, admission to hospice within 3 days of death was similar in both cohorts (28.8% v 26.4%), as was the rate of death in an acute care hospital. Retrospective and prospective measures identified similar physician and hospital patterns of end-of-life care. In multivariate models, a visit with an oncologist was positively associated with the use of chemotherapy, opiates, and hospice. Patients who were cared for by oncologists in small group practices were more likely to receive chemotherapy (retrospective only) and less likely to receive hospice (both) than those in large groups. Compared with patients who were cared for in teaching hospitals, those in other hospitals were more likely to receive chemotherapy (both) and to have toxicity (prospective) but were less likely to receive opiates (both) and hospice (retrospective).\nRetrospective and prospective measures, including a new measure of the use of opiate analgesia, identify some similar physician and hospital patterns of end-of-life care.","title":"Comparison of prospective and retrospective indicators of the quality of end-of-life cancer care.","pubmedId":"19001333"}
