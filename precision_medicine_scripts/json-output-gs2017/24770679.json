However, few studies have evaluated YAP protein expression in lung cancer, and the results have lacked consistency.\nYAP expression was evaluated in a total of 205 curatively resected lung adenocarcinomas and 36 cases of EGFR-mutated TKI-treated patients. Correlations between the expression of YAP and clinicopathologic features, response to EGFR-TKI treatment, and prognostic significance were analyzed.\nHigh cytoplasmic YAP expression was positively correlated with the clinicopathologic parameters that have been associated with favorable prognosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that high cytoplasmic YAP expression was an independent prognostic factor in lung adenocarcinomas (progression-free survival: hazard ratio [HR] 0.659; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.431-1.010; p \u003d 0.050; overall survival: HR, 0.474; 95 % CI 0.263-0.854; p \u003d 0.013) and EGFR-TKI-treated patients with EGFR mutation (progression-free survival: HR, 0.346; 95 % CI 0.146-0.818; p \u003d 0.016; overall survival: HR, 0.291; 95 % CI 0.125-0.676; p \u003d 0.004).\nHigh cytoplasmic YAP expression predicted a good clinical outcome for patients with lung adenocarcinoma and in EGFR-TKI-treated patients. Therefore, YAP may play a role in EGFR-TKI-treated lung cancer, and YAP targeting may enhance therapeutic effects in combination with other cancer drugs.","title":"Cytoplasmic YAP expression is associated with prolonged survival in patients with lung adenocarcinomas and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.","pubmedId":"24770679"}
