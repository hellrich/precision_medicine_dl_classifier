These high occurrences make RAS one of the most important drug targets in oncology. Three decades of effort to target RAS have been unsuccessful in generating drug therapies suggesting that it might represent an \u0027undruggable\u0027 target. However, recent reports highlighting new approaches for targeting RAS have uncovered more information on protein structure and identified new binding pockets. Efforts to target the KRAS G12C mutation specifically have shown promising results whereas other approaches have targeted various protein complexes. These advances could lead to development of new effective cancer drugs targeting RAS.","title":"Recent advances in cancer drug discovery targeting RAS.","pubmedId":"27506872"}
