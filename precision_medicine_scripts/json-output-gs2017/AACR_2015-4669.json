Genetic aberration is unknown in IMA without KRAS mutation.From an IMA cohort of 90 cases, consisting of 56 cases (62%) with KRAS mutations, we conducted whole-transcriptome sequencing on 32 IMAs, including 27 cases without KRAS mutation. We identified oncogenic fusions that occurred mutually exclusively with KRAS mutations: CD74-NRG1, SLC3A2-NRG1 (NRG1 fusions: 6/90), EZR-ERBB4, TRIM24-BRAF, and KIAA1468-RET.The CD74-NRG1 and SLC3A2-NRG1 fusion proteins contained the transmembrane domain of CD74 and SLC3A2 and retained the EGF-like domain of the NRG1 protein (NRG1 III-3 form). Membrane-tethered EGF-like domain might activate juxtacrine signaling through HER2:HER3 receptors. To reveal the mechanism of the oncogenicity, exposing EFM-19 cells which express HER2 and HER3 to conditioned media from H1299 cells expressing exogenous CD74-NRG1 fusion protein resulted in phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3, and downstream mitogen-activated kinase and AKT. The phosphorylation was suppressed by lapatinib and afatinib.When EZR-ERBB4 or TRIM24-BRAF cDNA was exogenously expressed in NIH3T3 cells, ERBB4 or downstream mediator of BRAF was phosphorylated under serum-free condition. The expression of fusion genes induced anchorage-independent growth. The phosphorylation and growth were suppressed by the kinase inhibitors targeting fusion-induced signaling.These results show that the NRG1, ERBB4 and BRAF fusions are novel driver mutations and potential targets. About 15% (13/90; 14.4%) of IMAs harbor druggable aberrations, taken together a small fraction of known driver aberrations.","title":"Druggable oncogene fusions in lung invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-4669"}
