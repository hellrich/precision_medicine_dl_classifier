Data on risk and survival analysis of palliative pancreatic resections followed by gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (Cx) are limited.\nBetween 2000 and 2009, a total of 45 patients had primary cytoreductive surgery (cS) (pancreaticoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy) followed by gemcitabine-based Cx (cS + Cx) for advanced PA. We matched 1:1 the cS + Cx group with 45 contemporaneous patients who primarily started palliative gemcitabine-based Cx for age, sex, performance status, and body mass index. Overall, survival was evaluated.\nLocal R0 and R1 resection in metastatic patients was achieved in 27% and 27%, respectively. The R2 resection status without distant metastasis resulted in 33%, whereas 13% showed a local R2 status with additional metastasis (M1). Median overall survival was 10.4 months after cytoreductive pancreatic surgery and consecutive gemcitabine-based Cx versus 7.2 months after upfront gemcitabine-based Cx (P \u003d 0.009). Median survival for R0/M1 patients was 14.4 months and 11.0 months for R2/M0 patients, whereas the median survival for R1/M1 and for R2/M1 patients was 7.3 months and 6.1 months, respectively.\nIndividual patients with advanced PA had a significantly longer overall survival after palliative pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by Cx than patients in a matched control group who underwent primarily palliative Cx.","title":"Cytoreductive Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer Improves Overall Outcome of Gemcitabine-Based Chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"25931260"}
