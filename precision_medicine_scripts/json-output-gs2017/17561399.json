The majority of these mutations map to one of three hot spots in the gene, and the rest are distributed over much of the PI3K coding sequence. Most of the cancer-specific mutations induce a gain of function that results in oncogenicity, elevated lipid kinase activity and constitutive signaling through the kinases Akt and TOR. The location of the mutations on a model structure of p110 alpha indicates several distinct mechanisms for the gain of function. The mutated p110 alpha proteins are promising cancer targets. Although identification of mutant-specific small-molecule inhibitors seems technically challenging, the therapeutic benefits from such inhibitors could be extremely important.","title":"Cancer-specific mutations in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.","pubmedId":"17561399"}
