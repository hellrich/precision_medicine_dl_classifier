In the present study 69 cases of liver metastasis were examined for their treatments and effects. One-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 49.2%, 16.2% and 6.8% in the 69 patients, respectively. Fourteen patients underwent hepatic resection plus hepatic artery infusion therapy. The overall survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were favorable: 88.3%, 55.6% and 29.6%, respectively. Three patients with H3 liver metastasis underwent hepatic resection plus hepatic artery infusion therapy. One patient is alive 29 months after operation, one died 25 months after operation, and the other is alive 8 months after operation. Thirteen patients with H3 liver metastasis from colorectal cancer underwent hepatic artery infusion therapy, and the one-year survival rate was 30.8%. None of the H3 patients without hepatic artery infusion therapy survived more than one year.","title":"[Hepatectomy and intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for hepatic metastasis of colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"9382528"}
