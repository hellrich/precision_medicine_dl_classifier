However, information on endothelial microparticles (EMPs) in mild COPD and emphysema is lacking.\nWe hypothesized that levels of CD31(+) EMPs phenotypic for endothelial cell apoptosis would be elevated in COPD and associated with percent emphysema on computed tomography (CT). Associations with pulmonary microvascular blood flow (PMBF), diffusing capacity, and hyperinflation were also examined.\nThe Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis COPD Study recruited participants with COPD and control subjects age 50-79 years with greater than or equal to 10 pack-years without clinical cardiovascular disease. CD31(+) EMPs were measured using flow cytometry in 180 participants who also underwent CTs and spirometry. CD62E(+) EMPs phenotypic for endothelial cell activation were also measured. COPD was defined by standard criteria. Percent emphysema was defined as regions less than -950 Hounsfield units on full-lung scans. PMBF was assessed on gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Hyperinflation was defined as residual volume/total lung capacity. Linear regression was used to adjust for potential confounding factors.\nCD31(+) EMPs were elevated in COPD compared with control subjects (P \u003d 0.03) and were notably increased in mild COPD (P \u003d 0.03). CD31(+) EMPs were positively related to percent emphysema (P \u003d 0.045) and were inversely associated with PMBF (P \u003d 0.047) and diffusing capacity (P \u003d 0.01). In contrast, CD62E(+) EMPs were elevated in severe COPD (P \u003d 0.003) and hyperinflation (P \u003d 0.001).\nCD31(+) EMPs, suggestive of endothelial cell apoptosis, were elevated in mild COPD and emphysema. In contrast, CD62E(+) EMPs indicative of endothelial activation were elevated in severe COPD and hyperinflation.","title":"Endothelial microparticles in mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema.
