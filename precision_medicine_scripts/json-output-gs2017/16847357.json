In this study, we examined the age-related change in the CGRP-containing nerves and its effects on the mucus metabolism. We compared the immunoreactivity for CGRP in the gastric mucosa of 7-week-old rats (young) to that of 52-week-old animals (middle-aged). The effects of CGRP on the mucin biosynthesis were compared using the stomachs from both young and middle-aged rats. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was measured in the surface and deep mucosa of the gastric corpus. The density of the CGRP nerve fibers was reduced in both the lamina propria and submucosa of the middle-aged rats compared to the young rats. CGRP stimulated the mucin biosynthesis in the cultured corpus mucosa from the 7-week-old rats, but not from the 52-week-old rats. The total NOS activity of the surface layer in the corpus mucosa was markedly reduced in the middle-aged rats compared to the young rats. These findings demonstrate the age-dependent reduction in the CGRP-induced mucin biosynthesis, as well as in the density of the CGRP fibers in the rat stomach. The decreased NOS activity in the surface layer of the oxyntic mucosa in the aged rats may also be a principal cause for the lack of regulation of the mucin biosynthesis by CGRP.","title":"Nitric oxide synthase activity in rat gastric mucosa contributes to mucin synthesis elicited by calcitonin gene-related peptide.","pubmedId":"16847357"}
