Thus, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of familial pancreatic cancer in a population of hospitalized patients with pancreatic cancer.\nA retrospective study based on the hospital charts of patients discharged with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. One hundred and eighty-seven patients or their relatives were called for a phone interview.\nThere were 97 males (51.9 %) and 90 (48.1 %) females. The overall mean ± SD age was 67.3 ± 11.8 years; the age of males was similar to that of females (P \u003d 0140). The mean size of the tumors found was 36.3 ± 17.4 mm (range of 5-110 mm); it was related to gender but was not related to the site of the tumor or the age of the patient. Regarding genetic diseases, three females (1.6 %) had familial adenomatous polyposis; three patients (1 male and two females) (1.6 %) had at least one relative with pancreatic cancer whereas only one 80-year old male patient (0.5 %) had two relatives affected by pancreatic cancer (the mother had died at the 65 years of age and the brother had died at 75 years of age).\nThe frequency of familial pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is small, but its importance, from the point of view of early diagnosis, is not negligible and patients with a risk of familial cancer merit an appropriate clinical follow-up.","title":"Implications and issues related to familial pancreatic cancer: a cohort study of hospitalized patients.","pubmedId":"26767414"}
