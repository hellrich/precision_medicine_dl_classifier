Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with HER3 and PTEN antibodies were conducted retrospectively.\nPatients who had negative HER3 staining (62.4%) had a better progression-free survival (PFS) than did those who had positive HER3 staining (P\u003d0.001; median PFS, 21 vs 11 months). Patients who had a PTEN score \u003e20 (78.1%) showed longer PFS than did those with a PTEN score ≤20 (P\u003d0.006; median PFS, 13 vs 9 months). Patients who had a PTEN score \u003e20 exhibited a longer overall survival (OS) than did those with a PTEN score ≤20 (P\u003d0.005; median OS, 48 vs 25 months). HER3 negativity and PTEN loss were identified as independent risk factors for PFS. PTEN loss was identified as an independent risk factor for OS.\nHER3 and PTEN expressions may be predictive markers, and PTEN expression may be a predictive and prognostic biomarker for trastuzumab treatment in HER2-positive MBCs.","title":"Role of HER3 expression and PTEN loss in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who received taxane plus trastuzumab treatment.","pubmedId":"24346286"}
