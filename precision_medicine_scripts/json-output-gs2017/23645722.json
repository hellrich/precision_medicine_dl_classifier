Surgical resection remains the only curative treatment, but fewer than 20% of patients qualify as candidates. The past two decades saw major changes in the treatment of advanced PDA, a shift of standard protocol from 5-fluorouracil to gemcitabine and gemcitabine-based combinations, the introduction of molecular target therapy and multi-agent regimens. However, even with advancements in medicine, PDA is still extremely resistant to currently available regimens, which results in poor prognosis, with only 5.2% of patients alive at three years. This provides a challenge to scientists as they seek to find the best active regimen with the least side-effects. In this article, we review the current recommended guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. In addition, we highlight major clinical trials since 2011.","title":"Current status in chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23645722"}
