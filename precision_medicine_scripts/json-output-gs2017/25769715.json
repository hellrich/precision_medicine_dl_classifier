Definitive RT is generally only used in inoperable patients. Despite a high-quality clinical trial showing adjuvant RT following lymphadenectomy in node-positive melanoma patients prevents local and regional recurrence, the role of adjuvant RT in the treatment of melanoma remains controversial and is underused. RT is highly effective in providing symptom palliation for metastatic melanoma. RT combined with new systemic options, such as immunotherapy, holds promise and is being actively evaluated.
