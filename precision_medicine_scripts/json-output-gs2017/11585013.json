Thus, aromatase inhibitors, taxanes and herceptin have all emerged as potentially valuable therapeutic agents for treatment of advanced breast cancer. Bisphosphonates have found a place in preventing skeletal complications in breast cancer patients with bone metastasis. Tamoxifen has a new role in chemoprevention in patients at high risk of breast cancer. This paper summarises these results.","title":"New drugs in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"11585013"}
