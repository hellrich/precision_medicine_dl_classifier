Activated ERK1/2were detected at different levels in the majority of these tumors, as assayed by immunostaining with an antibody specific for the dually phosphorylated and activated ERK1 and ERK2. ERK1/2 activation levels were higher in tumors with advanced regional lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.048) and in relapsed tumors (P \u003d 0.021). The expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (P \u003d 0.037), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha; P \u003c 0.001), and HER2 (P \u003d 0.066; positive trend) correlated with activation of ERK1/2. In a multivariate analysis, both TGF-alpha (P \u003c 0.0001) and HER2 (P \u003d 0.045) were independently correlated with ERK1/2 activation. In turn, activation of ERK1/2 was associated with a higher Ki-67 proliferative index (P \u003d 0.002). In EGF receptor-dependent model cells (A431 and DiFi), a specific EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (\"Iressa\"; ZD1839) and a chimeric anti-EGF receptor antibody (\"Cetuximab\"; C225) inhibited ERK 1/2 activation at concentrations that inhibited autocrine cell proliferation. In patients on treatment with C225, the activation of ERK1/2 in skin, an EGF receptor-dependent tissue, was lower compared with control skin. Parallel changes were seen in keratinocyte Ki67 proliferation indexes in skin from C225-treated patients. Taken together, these studies provide support for a role of activation of ERK1/2 in head and neck squamous carcinoma and a correlation with EGF receptor/TGF-alpha expression. The inhibition of ERK1/2 activation in vitro and in vivo by compounds targeting the EGF receptor points to the interest of ERK1/2 as potential surrogate markers of EGF-receptor signaling in clinical therapeutic studies.","title":"Activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases: association with epidermal growth factor receptor/transforming growth factor alpha expression in head and neck squamous carcinoma and inhibition by anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatments.","pubmedId":"11522647"}
