In this study, we studied the role of miR-1299 in cell proliferation of HCC. We found miR-1299 was significantly downregulated in HCC cells and tissues. miR-1299 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle in G0/G1 phase analyzed by MTT assay, soft agar assay, BrdU cell proliferation assay and cell cycle assay, while miR-1299 knockdown promoted cell proliferation and accelerated G1/S transition. Further analysis suggested the key regulator of G1/S transition, cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) was the target of miR-1299, miR-1299 inhibited CDK6 expression and bound to the 3\u0027UTR of CDK6. When double knockdown of miR-1299 and CDK6 promoted cell proliferation copied the phenotype caused by miR-1299 overexpression, suggesting miR-1299 inhibits cell proliferation by targeting CDK6. In summary, our data revealed miR-1299 inhibits cell proliferation, and might be a target for HCC therapy.","title":"miR-1299 suppresses cell proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by targeting CDK6.","pubmedId":"27490780"}
