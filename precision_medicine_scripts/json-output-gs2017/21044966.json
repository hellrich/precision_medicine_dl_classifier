Because specific histological and molecular genetic features of MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancers might influence tumor behavior and patient survival, we compared survival between patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer and matched control patients with colorectal cancer from the general population.\nIn this retrospective multicenter cohort study from Europe, 147 patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer were compared with 272 population-based control patients with colorectal cancer who were matched for country, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, stage, and subsite of colorectal cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were used to compare survival between patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer and control patients with colorectal cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nFive-year survival for patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI] \u003d 70% to 84%) and for control patients was 63% (95% CI \u003d 56% to 69%) (log-rank test, P \u003d .002). After adjustment for differences in age, stage, sex, subsite, country, and year of diagnosis, survival remained better for MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer patients than for control patients (hazard ratio of death \u003d 0.48, 95% CI \u003d 0.32 to 0.72).\nIn a European study cohort, we found statistically significantly better survival for patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer than for matched control patients with colorectal cancer.","title":"Survival of MUTYH-associated polyposis patients with colorectal cancer and matched control colorectal cancer patients.","pubmedId":"21044966"}
