Limited resections are an attractive alternative for elderly patients with resectable NSCLC because of the potential reduction in postoperative complications. Curative radiation therapy is an acceptable alternative for elderly patients who are unfit for or refuse surgery. Hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy is of particular interest for this population because of its favorable tolerance. Elderly patients may tolerate chemotherapy poorly because of comorbidity and organ failure. The survival benefit obtained with adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy in the younger population may vanish or decrease in the elderly because of a potential higher toxic death rate or lower compliance to treatment. The efficacy and feasibility of adjuvant chemotherapy for elderly patients need to be investigated in specific trials. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains an experimental approach under investigation in the general patient population, and consequently should not be considered in clinical practice in the elderly. Retrospective analyses on chemoradiation in elderly patients should be considered globally ambiguous and at risk of selection bias. Only specifically designed prospective studies will elucidate the real role and feasibility of this combined approach in the treatment of unselected elderly patients.","title":"Treatment of stage I-III non-small-cell lung cancer in the elderly.","pubmedId":"16683415"}
