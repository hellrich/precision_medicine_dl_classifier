We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using a 16q23 probe in more than 7,400 prostate cancers with clinical follow-up data assembled in a tissue microarray format. Chromosome 16q deletion was found in 21% of cancers, and was linked to advanced tumor stage, high Gleason grade, accelerated cell proliferation, the presence of lymph node metastases (p \u003c 0.0001 each) and positive surgical margin (p \u003d 0.0004). 16q Deletion was more frequent in ERG fusion-positive (27%) as compared to ERG fusion-negative cancers (16%, p \u003c 0.0001), and was linked to other ERG-associated deletions including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (p \u003c 0.0001) and 3p13 (p \u003d 0.0303). In univariate analysis, the deletion of 16q was linked to early biochemical recurrence independently from the ERG status (p \u003c 0.0001). Tumors with codeletions of 16q and PTEN had a worse prognosis (p \u003d 0.0199) than those with PTEN or the deletion of 16q alone. Multivariate modeling revealed that the prognostic value of 16q/PTEN deletion patterns was independent from the established prognostic factors. In summary, the results of our study demonstrate that the deletion of 16q and PTEN cooperatively drives prostate cancer progression, and suggests that deletion analysis of 16q and PTEN could be of important clinical value particularly for preoperative risk assessment of the clinically most challenging group of low- and intermediated grade prostate cancers.","title":"Concurrent deletion of 16q23 and PTEN is an independent prognostic feature in prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"26009879"}
