Sp1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that is important in the transcription of a number of regulatory genes involved in cancer cell growth, differentiation, and metastasis. In this study, we investigated Sp1 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and its association with clinical outcome. We studied 42 patients with primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The expression of Sp1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. All 42 patients had clinical follow-up information and were evaluated for survival. Sp1 protein was aberrantly overexpressed in a subset of primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These tumors all developed metastasis, whereas none of the primary tumors without lymph node metastasis showed Sp1 overexpression. Statistically, Sp1 overexpression was associated with higher stage, higher grade, and lymph node metastasis (P \u003c 0.001, P \u003d 0.036, and P \u003c 0.0001, respectively). Additionally, patients of this subset had a much shorter overall survival than patients without Sp1 overexpression, as evidenced by Kaplan-Meier plots and the log-rank test (P \u003d 0.002). The 5-year overall survival rate was 19% in patients with Sp1 overexpression, compared with 55% in patients without Sp1 overexpression. The median survival was only 13 months for patients with Sp1 overexpression, compared with 65 months for patients without Sp1 overexpression. In conclusion, Sp1 is a new biomarker that identifies a subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with aggressive clinical behavior. It can be used at initial diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma to identify patients with an increased probability of cancer metastasis and much shortened overall survival.","title":"Sp1, a new biomarker that identifies a subset of aggressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18628415"}
