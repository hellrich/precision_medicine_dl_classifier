In this study, we assessed the presence of pathogenic mutations in the LKB1/STK11 gene in 46 unrelated PJS families, and also carried genotype-phenotype correlation in regard of the development of cancer in 170 PJS patients belonging to these families. All LKB1/STK11 variants detected with single-strand conformational polymorphism were confirmed by direct sequencing, and those without LKB1/STK11 mutation were further submitted to Southern blot analysis for detection of deletions/rearrangements. Statistical analysis for genotype-phenotype correlation was performed. In 59% (27/46) of unrelated PJS cases, pathogenic mutations in the LKB1/STK11 gene, including 9 novel mutations, were identified. The new mutations were 2 splice site deletion-insertions, 2 missenses, 1 nonsense, and 4 abnormal splice sites. Genotype-phenotype analysis did not yield any significant differences between patients carrying mutations in LKB1/STK11 versus those without mutations, even with respect to primary biliary adenocarcinoma. This study presents the molecular characterization and cancer occurrence of a large cohort of PJS patients, increases the mutational spectrum of LKB1/STK11 allelic variants worldwide, and provides a new insight useful for clinical diagnosis and genetic counseling of PJS families.","title":"Molecular and clinical characteristics in 46 families affected with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","pubmedId":"17404884"}
