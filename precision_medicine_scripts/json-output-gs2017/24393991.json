Liver and intrapelvic metastases were found upon examination 6 months after surgery during adjuvant chemotherapy with XELOX plus bevacizumab. After hepatic subsegmentectomy, the patient received S-1 treatment in combination with radiotherapy for the intrapelvic metastasis. One year after the second surgery, abdominoperineal rectal resection was performed as the intrapelvic tumor had increased in size. At 16 months after the third surgery, computed tomography( CT) revealed a small lung nodule that gradually increased in size. The patient underwent partial lung resection. The nodule was a recurrence of the sigmoid colon cancer. During this period, the patient was treated again with S-1 combined with radiotherapy because 2 intrapelvic metastases had been identified. At present, these metastases have been well controlled for 3 years after the initial recurrence. Thus, it is suggested that aggressive radiotherapy and resection are effective therapies for recurrence of chemotherapy-resistant colon cancer.
