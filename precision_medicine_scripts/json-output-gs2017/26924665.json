Inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity relates not only to the microscopic appearances of the tumour cell population, but pertains also to other essential aspects of the cancer, including the grade of differentiation, growth pattern and desmoplastic stroma. While the existence of considerable morphological variation is well known among pathologists, it is usually not fully appreciated by the wider community. Morphological heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer is only partially represented in the WHO classification, and current pathology guidelines do not recommend reporting on morphological variation other than the conventional variants of ductal adenocarcinoma. Although tumour heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a major determinant of therapeutic response, morphological heterogeneity has been left unconsidered as a possible proxy for underlying aberrations - genomic or otherwise - that determine the effect of treatment. Various aspects of morphological heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are illustrated in this article and discussed along with the possible implications for patient management and research.
