Firstly, the relationship between the fetal uterus and the linea terminalis and the position of the uterus within the pelvic cavity was noted. Then the distance between the fundus of the uterus to the promontory and pubic symphysis were measured. Fetal uteri were classified according to their physical appearances. Finally the lengths of the corpus and cervix in three planes and the anteflexion angle were measured.\nDuring the fetal period, the fundus of the uterus was above the linea terminalis in 94% and below it in 6% of the cases. The distance between the fundus of the uterus and the promontory significantly correlated with the distance between the fundus of the uterus and the pubic symphysis (p\u003c0.001). This was true for the correlation between the gestational age and the orthogonal lengths of the uterine corpus and cervix (p\u003c0.001). As the gestational age advanced, the anteflexion angle was noted to reduce from 177 degrees to 120 degrees . The shape of the uterus was either cylindrical, pear-shaped, heart-shaped or hourglass-shaped during the fetal period.\nWe believe that the data obtained through dissections of the human fetuses in this study will help identifying uterine developmental variations, anomalies and pathologies and will contribute to the studies carried out in obstetrics, perinatology, forensic medicine and fetal pathology departments.","title":"Anatomical development of the fetal uterus.","pubmedId":"17045762"}
