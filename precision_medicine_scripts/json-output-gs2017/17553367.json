The therapeutic strategy encompasses intended curative therapy: radical prostatectomy with complete removal of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles performed as an open procedure or laparoscopically, external beam radiation therapy, or implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate (brachytherapy). In older patients with good prognostic factors, active surveillance should be considered. The various therapeutic modalities are reviewed.","title":"[Treatment of localised prostate cancer].","pubmedId":"17553367"}
