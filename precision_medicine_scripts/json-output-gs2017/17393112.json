PTEN gene packaged with lipofectin was transferred into breast cancer cell line MDA468 and parental MDA468 cells served as controls. RT-PCR and Western blot were done to detect the expression of target genes. The expression of phosphospecific protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) protein stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) was also detected. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry with a double-staining method using FITC-conjugated annexin V and PI. MDA468 cells transfected with PTEN gene could express PTEN mRNA and protein. PTEN decreased the phosphorylation level of AKT protein and down-regulated FAK protein expression in MDA468 stimulated by EGF. The apoptosis rate was 21.68%. PTEN induced breast cancer apoptosis phosphatase activity-dependently. The mechanism is possibly related with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB)/AKT signaling pathway. Those results may provide new clues on the gene therapy in breast cancer.","title":"Exogenous PTEN gene induces apoptosis in breast carcinoma cell line MDA468.","pubmedId":"17393112"}
