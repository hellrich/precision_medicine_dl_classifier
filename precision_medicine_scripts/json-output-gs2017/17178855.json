We hypothesized that HMGA1 expression is a determinant of cellular invasiveness and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Stable silencing of HMGA1 in MiaPaCa2 and PANC1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells was achieved by transfection of short hairpin RNA-generating vectors. Additionally, stable overexpression of HMGA1 in MiaPaCa2 cells (characterized by low levels of inherent HMGA1 expression) was achieved. HMGA1 silencing resulted in significant reductions in cellular invasiveness through Matrigel; in cellular matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity, mRNA levels, and gene promoter activity; and in Akt phosphorylation at Ser(473). Conversely, forced HMGA1 overexpression resulted in significant increases in cellular invasiveness; in cellular MMP-9 activity, mRNA levels, and promoter activity; and in Akt phosphorylation at Ser(473). HMGA1 overexpression-induced increases in invasiveness were MMP-9 dependent. The role of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt in mediating HMGA1-dependent invasiveness was elucidated by a specific PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and constitutively active and dominant-negative Akt adenoviral constructs. Akt-dependent modulation of MMP-9 activity contributed significantly to HMGA1 overexpression-induced increases in invasive capacity. Furthermore, HMGA1 silencing resulted in reductions in metastatic potential and tumor growth in vivo and in tumoral MMP-9 activity. Our findings suggest that HMGA1 may be a novel molecular determinant of invasiveness and metastasis, as well as a potential therapeutic target, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"HMGA1 is a determinant of cellular invasiveness and in vivo metastatic potential in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"17178855"}
