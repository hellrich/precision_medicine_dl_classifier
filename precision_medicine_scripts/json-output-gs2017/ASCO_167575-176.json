In terms of active antigen specific immunotherapy, it is important to consider the addition of immunomodulatory approaches such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). We evaluated whether seven aberrantly expressed proteins associated with bad prognosis could be immunogenic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with PDAC. Also we performed the immunogenicity studies in mice to find the best IFN-gamma producing peptides derived from seven proteins. Finally we added anti-CTLA-4 inhibitor so see if we can improve the observed in vitroresponses. Methods: Predicted peptides from Bcl-2XL , ABCG2, PTP4A3, Sox9, APLP2, VCP and Mcl-2 were tested by IFN-gamma ELISPOT in PDAC PBMC patients with 100 % Karnofsky (n \u003d 10) and matched controls (n \u003d 10). Also the peptides were evaluated in mice for immunogenicity studies using ELISA and ELISPOT. Additionally we tested if the best peptides can improve the magnitude of the IFN-gamma responses by adding escalated doses in vitroof ipilimumab. Results: Some predicted peptides were significantly elevated in PDAC PBMC when compared with donors controls (Bcl-2XL p \u003d 0.005, ABCG2 p \u003d 0.0001, PTP4A3 p \u003d 0.005, Sox9 p \u003d 0.0001, APLP2 p \u003d 0.001, VCP p \u003d 0.0017 and Mcl-1 p \u003d 0.0001. IFN-gamma immune responses were significant in mice immunized with Bcl-XL p \u003d 0.001, ABCG2 p \u003d 0.001 and PTP4A3 p \u003d 0.005. The combination in vitrowith ipilimumab and multi-peptide vaccination increased IFN-gamma production (p \u003d 0.0001). Conclusions: PDAC contains overexpressed proteins that can serve as targets for active antigen specific immunotherapy. These data will serve as a proof of principle to start evaluating the best immunogenic peptides in PDAC animal models and validate the human ELISPOT studies in a large cohort of PDAC patients. Combinatorial immunotreatment for PDAC could be feasible in active disease and potentially for relapse prevention.","title":"Multipeptide pancreatic cancer immunotherapy and immunomodulation.","pubmedId":"ASCO_167575-176"}
