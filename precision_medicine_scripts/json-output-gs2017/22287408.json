These tumors are present in almost all cases of KIT-CD117 mutations. When located outside the gastrointestinal tract, they are referred to as extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We present a case of a 72-year-old female with acute abdomen. Computed tomography detected intestinal obstruction and failed to determine the causative pathology. The patient underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed pelvic extra-gastrointestinal tumor originating from the broad ligament of the uterus. This case is unique with regard to symptoms and the unusual anatomic location of the mass. Surgeons should be aware of the extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumor entity and its manifestations and management.","title":"Extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumor presenting as a surgical emergency.","pubmedId":"22287408"}
