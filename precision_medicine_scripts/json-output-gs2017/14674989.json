Loss of PTEN function has been implicated in the progression of several types of cancer, but the correlation between loss of PTEN expression and advanced carcinomas is not well established. The capacity for angiogenesis of a tumor is known to play a very important role in growth and metastasis, and there have been reports that PTEN relates to angiogenesis. In the present study, formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissues from 101 patients with breast carcinomas, including 88 cases of invasive ductal carcinomas and 13 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), were evaluated by immunohistochemical methods for the expression of PTEN and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as microvessel density (MVD). The results were compared with the clinicopathologic parameters. There was no loss of PTEN expression in any of the cases of DCIS, but 28 (32%) of the 88 invasive cases did not express PTEN. Loss of PTEN expression was associated with lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.03), but did not correlate with tumor size, tumor grade, MVD or recurrence. VEGF expression significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis in invasive ductal carcinoma (P \u003d 0.01). There was no correlation between the expression of PTEN and that of VEGF (P \u003d 0.63). The present study suggests that loss of PTEN expression is common and correlates with tumor progression and lymph node metastasis in breast carcinoma. The relationship between loss of PTEN and progression of breast cancer may not be explained by modulation of angiogenesis.","title":"Inactivation of the PTEN gene protein product is associated with the invasiveness and metastasis, but not angiogenesis, of breast cancer.","pubmedId":"14674989"}
