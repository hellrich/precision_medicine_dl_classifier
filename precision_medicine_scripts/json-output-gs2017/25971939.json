We now report responses to the MET inhibitors crizotinib and cabozantinib in four patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas harboring mutations leading to MET exon 14 skipping, highlighting a new therapeutic strategy for the 4% of lung adenocarcinoma patients whose tumors harbor this previously underappreciated genetic alteration.\nOncogenic mutations in the MET exon 14 splice sites that cause exon 14 skipping occur in 4% of lung adenocarcinomas. We report responses to the MET inhibitors crizotinib and cabozantinib in patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring MET exon 14 splice site mutations, identifying a new potential therapeutic target in this disease.","title":"Response to MET inhibitors in patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas harboring MET mutations causing exon 14 skipping.","pubmedId":"25971939"}
