This reluctance to expand is problematic, especially for people with diabetes who lack sufficient numbers of functional insulin-producing β cells and could therefore benefit from therapies for β cell expansion. In this issue of the JCI, Chamberlain et al. describe a surprising series of observations that involve two downstream arms of the RAS signaling pathway, MAPK and RASSF proteins, which also involve the tumor suppressor menin. The findings of this study may help explain the difficulty of inducing β cell proliferation and may provide leads for therapeutic expansion of human β cells.
