When the endoscopic procedure is performed for a superficial cancer or its precursors, with a curative intent, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is generally preferred to mucosal ablation with a thermal (Nd:YAG) or non-thermal (photodynamic therapy) procedure. In addition to esophageal squamous cell cancer and gastric cancer, new indications of EMR arise in the Barrett esophagus. Guidelines for safe indications concern diameter, polypoid or non polypoid morphology with the subtypes elevated, flat and depressed, and depth of invasion. A superficial invasion in the sub-mucosa is a relative contra-indication in the esophagus, but not in the stomach. The technique of EMR is now codified with an injection into the submucosa for lifting the lesion and either suction with a cap, grasping with a forceps if a 2 channel instrument is used, or tissue incision with a needle knife. En bloc, gives better results than piecemeal resection. The most frequent complication is bleeding. When legitimate indications are respected, the results of EMR are equivalent to those of surgical resection and have reached the consensus level. The major indication in palliation is the relief of dysphagia from malignant esophageal obstruction. Increased indications are proposed for malignant pyloric obstruction. Multiple models of metal expandable and coated stents with appropriate balance between rigidity and flexibility (nitinol alloy) and enough expansive radial force are now offered. After stenting the survival period is short and there is a toll of complications.","title":"Treatment of esophagogastric tumors.","pubmedId":"12561005"}
