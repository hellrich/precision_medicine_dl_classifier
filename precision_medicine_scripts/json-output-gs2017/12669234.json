The aim of this study is to investigate the involvement of PTEN mRNA and protein expression in HCC.\nThe level of PTEN mRNA expression in HCC specimens was analyzed by Northern blot. PTEN poly-clonal antibody was raised by immunizing New Zealand white rabbit with (His)(6)-tagged PTEN fusion protein and characterized by Western blot. The level of PTEN protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. The significance of PTEN in HCC was analyzed by comparing its expression level with the clinicopathological parameters of HCC patients.\nFour transcripts of PTEN mRNA at 5.5 kb, 4.4 kb, 2.4 kb, and 1.8 kb were detected in most para-carcinoma liver tissues, and the expression level of PTEN mRNA in carcinoma liver tissues was found to decrease significantly. The poly-clonal antibody raised against histidine-tagged fusion PTEN protein showed specific immuno-reactivity to PTEN protein. Using the specific poly-clonal antibody prepared and characterized by ourselves, we found that PTEN protein was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues compared with paired para-carcinoma tissues. The protein expression of PTEN is negatively associated with the pathological grading and presence of cancer thrombus of HCC.\nDown-regulation of PTEN expression may play an important role in the development of HCC and the level of PTEN expression may be a potential adjuvant parameter in forecasting the progression and prognosis of HCC patients.","title":"The alteration of PTEN tumor suppressor expression and its association with the histopathological features of human primary hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"12669234"}
