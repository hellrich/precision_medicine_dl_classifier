The aim of this study is to determine the discordance of EGFR mutations between primary and corresponding metastatic tumors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nThirty five paired primary tumors and corresponding metastases from Cancer Center of Sun Yatsen University were evaluated for the EGFR mutations by TaqMan RT-PCR analysis.\nEGFR mutations were detected in 29 of 35 primary tumors and in 18 of 35 corresponding metastases. 31.43% (11 of 35, P\u003d0.008) showed discordance in EGFR mutations between primary tumors and corresponding metastases. The EGFR mutation status was consistent in 68.57% (24 of 35) patients.\nEGFR mutations were discordant between the primary tumor and the corresponding metastases in NSCLC.","title":"[Discordance of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations between primary and corresponding metastatic tumors in non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"21645456"}
