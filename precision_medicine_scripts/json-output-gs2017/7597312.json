In human melanoma, the c-myc and N-ras oncogenes have been found to be activated in approximately 50% and 15% of the analyzed material, respectively. These studies have mostly been done on fresh tumor material or cell lines. Only in a few cases has an attempt been made to look at tumor heterogeneity or clonality with respect to the activation of oncogenes. We have adjusted the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) technique to screen paraffin-embedded melanoma material for the presence of N-ras mutations and found genetic defects at particular progression stages. In one melanoma of the skin, we were able to sublocalize an N-ras mutation in the intraepidermal tumor part, that was absent in the part deeply invading the dermal layer. We conclude that a thorough investigation of N-ras activation in human melanoma should include analysis of histologically different parts of the tumor.","title":"Analysis of N-ras mutations in human cutaneous melanoma: tumor heterogeneity detected by polymerase chain reaction/single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis.","pubmedId":"7597312"}
