We report here two cases of rectal stromal tumours in a 77-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man, confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Surgery for rectal GIST patients is the standard treatment and adjuvant imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is indicated for GISTs with a high risk of malignancy, as well as in the case of metastatic or unresectable tumours.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumour of the rectum: a report of two cases.","pubmedId":"22826743"}
