A review was undertaken to determine whether this approach is justified by long-term survival.\nA single surgeon\u0027s 8 year experience of 118 consecutive patients (74 men) of median age 70 years (range 45-84) who underwent upper lobectomy for pathological stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was reviewed. The preoperative characteristics, perioperative course and survival of the 27 cases with severe heterogeneous emphysema of apical distribution and a predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppoFEV(1)) of \u003c40% (lobarLVRS group) were compared with the remaining 91 cases with a ppoFEV(1) of \u003e40% (control group).\nPostoperative mortality was 1 of 27 in the lobarLVRS group and 2 of 91 in the control group (p \u003d NS). Five-year survival in the lobarLVRS group was 35% compared with 65% in the control group without concomitant severe emphysema (p \u003d 0.001), although rates of tumour recurrence were similar.\nLong-term survival after lobarLVRS for stage I lung cancer is limited by physiological rather than oncological factors. However, outcomes are still better than those reported for any other modality of treatment in this group of high-risk patients. This finding justifies the decision to offer lobectomy in these selected cases.","title":"Is the initial feasibility of lobectomy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer in severe heterogeneous emphysema justified by long-term survival?","pubmedId":"17289864"}
