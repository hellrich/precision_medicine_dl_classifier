EGFR mutations are found in 30-40% of adenocarcinoma, but rarely in other histologic subtypes. EGFR mutations are occasionally found in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in our clinical practice.  However, there is little data demonstrating the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in SCC harboring EGFR mutations.  Methods:  We investigated the frequency of EGFR mutation positive SCC of the lung between April 2006 and October 2010. The efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer patients with SCC harboring EGFR mutations was retrospectively evaluated.  Results:  Thirty of 249 patients with SCC (13.3%) had EGFR mutations. The types of EGFR mutation were exon 19 deletion (19/33, 58%), L858R point mutation in exon 21 (12/33, 36%), and G719S point mutation in exon 18 (2/33, 6%). Twenty of these 33 patients were treated with EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib 18; erlotinib 2). Five of 20 EGFR mutation positive patients responded to EGFR-TKIs with the response rate of 25.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7 to 49.1%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival were 1.4 months (95% CI, 0.7 to 5.8 months), and 14.6 months (95% CI, 2.9 months to undeterminable), respectively. Approximately one third of EGFR mutation positive SCC patients obtained PFS greater than six months.  Conclusions:  Although EGFR-TKIs seem to be less effective in EGFR mutation positive SCC than EGFR mutation positive adenocarcinoma, some EGFR mutation positive patients with SCC can obtain clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs. EGFR mutational analysis is recommended even in patients with SCC to select and treat patients properly.","title":"How sensitive are epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung harboring epidermal growth factor receptor genesensitive mutations-","pubmedId":"ASCO_78226-102"}
