Due to the extensive vascularisation seen on MRI, digital subtraction angiography was performed. To reduce intraoperative bleeding, the vasculature was embolized. The tumor was resected together with the submandibular gland, since a connection between gland and tumor could not be excluded intraoperatively. Histology showed a pleomorphic adenoma with an intact capsule and no indication of malignancy. Pleomorphic adenomas are typical tumors of the salivary glands; however, they can also occur outside the gland. The tumor and its pseudocapsule must be fully resected to prevent recurrence.","title":"[Cervical giant tumor in a 56-year-old female patient].","pubmedId":"19727630"}
