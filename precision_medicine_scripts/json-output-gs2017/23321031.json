However, its relationship with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) remains unclear.\nTo investigate a quantitative assessment of this relationship, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between diabetes and the risk of ECC. We identified studies by searching Embase (from 1 January 1974 to 30 June 2012), Medline (from 1 January 1966 to 30 June 2012), and the reference lists of related articles. Summary relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated with a random-effects model.\nA total of 9 articles (4 case-control and 5 cohort studies) were included in this study. Compared with those without DM, individuals with DM had an increased risk of ECC (for case-control studies: summary OR\u003d1.61, 95% CI: 1.05-2.49, p\u003d0.063 for heterogeneity; for cohort studies: summary RR\u003d1.61, 95% CI: 1.14-2.29, p\u003d0.005 for heterogeneity). The funnel plot showed no evidence for publication bias concerning DM and the risk of ECC (Egger’s test, p\u003d0.699; Begg’s test, p\u003d0.175).\nThese findings strongly reveal the positive link between DM and the increased risk of ECC.","title":"Diabetes mellitus and increased risk of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"23321031"}
