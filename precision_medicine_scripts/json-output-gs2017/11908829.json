Radiographs revealed pneumomediastinum and SC emphysema. Sequential radiographs confirmed a worsening of the SC emphysema. Extensive, nonsurgical evaluation failed to reveal the source of the air within the mediastinum. Exploratory thoracotomy revealed an emphysematous right middle lung lobe. Lobectomy of the right middle lung lobe resolved both the pneumomediastinum and SC emphysema. Histopathological evaluation confirmed pulmonary emphysema. A variation of congenital pulmonary emphysema was considered in this case.","title":"Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and pulmonary emphysema in a young schipperke.","pubmedId":"11908829"}
