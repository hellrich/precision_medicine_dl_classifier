The addition of anti-ERBB2 (HER2) targeted therapy to chemotherapy improves survival for ERBB2-amplified advanced GC patients; however, the majority of GC patients do not harbor this alteration and thus cannot benefit from targeted therapy under current practice paradigms.\nProspective comprehensive genomic profiling of 116 predominantly locally advanced or metastatic (90.0%) gastric cancer cases was performed to identify genomic alterations (GAs) associated with a potential response to targeted therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or targeted therapy-based clinical trials.\nOverall, 78% of GC cases harbored one clinically relevant GA or more, with the most frequent alterations being found in TP53 (50%), ARID1A (24%), KRAS (16%), CDH1 (15%), CDKN2A (14%), CCND1 (9.5%), ERBB2 (8.5%), PIK3CA (8.6%), MLL2 (6.9%), FGFR2 (6.0%), and MET (6.0%). Receptor tyrosine kinase genomic alterations were detected in 20.6% of cases, primarily ERBB2, FGFR2, and MET amplification, with ERBB2 alterations evenly split between amplifications and base substitutions. Rare BRAF mutations (2.6%) were also observed. One MET-amplified GC patient responded for 5 months to crizotinib, a multitargeted ALK/ROS1/MET inhibitor.\nComprehensive genomic profiling of GC identifies clinically relevant GAs that suggest benefit from targeted therapy including MET-amplified GC and ERBB2 base substitutions.","title":"Prospective comprehensive genomic profiling of advanced gastric carcinoma cases reveals frequent clinically relevant genomic alterations and new routes for targeted therapies.","pubmedId":"25882375"}
