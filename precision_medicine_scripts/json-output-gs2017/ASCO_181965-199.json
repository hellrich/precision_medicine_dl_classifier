Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 60 endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients from July 2011 to November 2015, who have received oral gefitinib 250 mg once daily. Gefitinib was taken until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or death. Results: At the time of last follow-up visit, 1 death had occurred. Among the 59 patients who remained survival, 17 patients progressed. Overall, the median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 10 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.5312.46 months, p \u003c 0.05). The response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 33.33% and 71.66%, respectively. However, there was longer mPFS in first line therapy than that in second line therapy: in first-line gefitinib therapy, mPFS was 12 months among 41 patients (95% CI: 9.5814.41 months, p \u003c 0.05); in the second line therapy, mPFS was 7 months among 19 patients (95% CI: 1.3112.68 months, p \u003c 0.05). Furthermore, in subgroup analyses examining different EGFR mutation types, we noted mPFS was significantly longer for patient with exon 19 deletion than that with positive exon 21in both first line therapy and second line therapy. The most common Grade 1 or 2 adverse events included rash (76.6%), abnormal liver function (60%), dry skin (48.3%), diarrhoea (46.6%), fatigue (40%) and paronychia (33.3%) etcetera in non-haematological toxicity, whereas anemia(33.3%), leukocytopenia (20%) etcetera were included in haematological toxicity. Conclusions: Patients with NSCLC who were selected by positive exon 21 or 19 deletion mutations had significantly longer mPFS in first line therapy than that in second line therapy when treated with gefitinib. And EGFR mutation types may influence the response to gefitinib therapy.","title":"A comparison of gefitinib for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with different EGFR mutation types.","pubmedId":"ASCO_181965-199"}
