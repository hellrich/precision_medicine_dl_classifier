Established cell lines remain a useful tool for investigating these molecular events. Here we present a review of available information on commonly used pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines as a resource to help investigators select the cell lines most appropriate for their particular research needs. Information on clinical history; in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics; phenotypic characteristics, such as adhesion, invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis; and genotypic status of commonly altered genes (KRAS, p53, p16, and SMAD4) was evaluated. Identification of both consensus and discrepant information in the literature suggests careful evaluation before selection of cell lines and attention be given to cell line authentication.","title":"Phenotype and genotype of pancreatic cancer cell lines.","pubmedId":"20418756"}
