Imatinib (IM) has been shown to prolong recurrence-free survival after complete surgery and is now approved as adjuvant therapy (400 â€‰mg/day) for high-risk GIST patients. IM is well tolerated, with mild to moderate side effects observed. Whether adjuvant IM prolongs overall survival is under evaluation in two ongoing clinical trials.","title":"Adjuvant imatinib therapy for gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"22069174"}
