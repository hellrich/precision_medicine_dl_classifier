In clinically localized low-risk cases, the results of radiotherapy and surgery are very similar. Patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer, often not suited for radical prostatectomy, seem to benefit from higher radiation doses and additional Androgen ablation, although questions remain regarding the treatment volume of radiotherapy and the optimal timing and duration of androgen deprivation. Standardised target volume definitions and dose prescriptions for different risk groups and improved patient selection for radiotherapy are required.","title":"[Radiotherapy for prostate cancer].","pubmedId":"17492410"}
