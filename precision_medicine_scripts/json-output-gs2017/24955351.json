Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated on a per patient based analysis. Subgroup analyses considering the device used (PET versus PET/CT) and the localization of the primary tumor (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IH-CCa), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EH-CCa), and hilar cholangiocarcinoma (H-CCa)) were carried out.\nTwenty-three studies including 1232 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of (18)F-FDG-PET or PET/CT were 81% and 82%, respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 80% and 89% for PET, 82% and 75% for PET/CT, 95% and 83% for IH-CCa, 84% and 95% for H-CCa, and 76% and 74% for EH-CCa.\n(18)F-FDG-PET and PET/CT were demonstrated to be accurate diagnostic imaging methods for primary tumor evaluation in patients with CCa. These tools have a better diagnostic accuracy in patients with IH-CCa than in patients with EH-CCa. Further studies are needed to evaluate the accuracy of (18)F-FDG-PET or PET/CT in patients with H-CCa.","title":"Diagnostic accuracy of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the evaluation of the primary tumor in patients with cholangiocarcinoma: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"24955351"}
