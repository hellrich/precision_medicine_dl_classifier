PIK3R1 mutations were found in 10 samples (2.2%) and underexpression in 283 samples (61.8%). AKT1 mutations were found in 15 samples (3.3%) and overexpression in 116 samples (25.3%). PIK3R1 underexpression tended to mutual exclusivity with PIK3CA mutations (p \u003d 0.00097). PIK3CA mutations were associated with better metastasis-free survival and PIK3R1 underexpression was associated with poorer metastasis-free survival (p \u003d 0.014 and p \u003d 0.00028, respectively). By combining PIK3CA mutation and PIK3R1 expression status, four prognostic groups were identified with significantly different metastasis-free survival (p \u003d 0.00046). On Cox multivariate regression analysis, the prognostic significance of PIK3R1 underexpression was confirmed in the total population (p \u003d 0.0013) and in breast cancer subgroups.\nPIK3CA mutations and PIK3R1 underexpression show opposite effects on patient outcome and could become useful prognostic and predictive factors in breast cancer.","title":"PIK3R1 underexpression is an independent prognostic marker in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"24229379"}
