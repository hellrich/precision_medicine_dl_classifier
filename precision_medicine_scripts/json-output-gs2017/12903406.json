The gene amplification of cyclin D1 was detected by Southern blot analysis and the protein expression of pRb gene was examined by Western blot analysis.\nHomozygous deletion of exon 1 were found in two cell lines and no mutation was found within exon 1 and exon 2 in five cell lines. Cyclin D1 gene amplification was observed in one cell line and all of the five cell lines showed hyper-phosphorylated pRb protein.\nThese findings have demonstrated that there are abnormalities of pRb-p16 regulatory pathway in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, revealing the alteration of the p16 and cyclin D1 genes.","title":"[Changes of p16 gene, cyclin D1 gene, and pRb protein in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines].","pubmedId":"12903406"}
