Successful placement of an endoprosthesis was achieved in 68 patients (95.8%). Bilirubin declined in 67 patients (98.5%). There was no procedure-related mortality. Twenty-two patients (31%) received further surgical therapy, and 47 received an endoprosthesis as their only therapeutic intervention. In the latter group, bilirubin normalized in 44 of 46 patients surviving longer than 30 days (95.7%). Mean survival was 466 days (median 410, range 23-1515), which compares favorably with surgical palliation. Complications mainly involved clogging of the endoprosthesis, which was easily treated endoscopically and, more significantly, duodenal stenoses secondary to continued tumor growth in almost 25% of the patients. Although endoscopic drainage is a safe and effective method of relieving biliary obstruction in patients with ampullary carcinoma, we feel it should be reserved for poor surgical candidates and for those patients with a limited life expectancy due to metastatic disease.","title":"Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.
