Postmortem studies on brains from schizophrenia patients have revealed changes in the mRNA expression levels of v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3), one of the NRG1 receptor genes. These observations suggest that NRG1-ERBB signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. To assess whether the ERBB3 gene could be implicated in vulnerability to schizophrenia, we conducted a case-control (399 patients and 438 controls) association study in Japanese subjects. There were no significant association between the polymorphisms or haplotypes of ERBB3 and schizophrenia. The present study shows that ERBB3 does not play a major role in conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Japanese population.","title":"No association between the ERBB3 gene and schizophrenia in a Japanese population.","pubmedId":"17275115"}
