Two hundred and forty-three patients with various malignant tumors were treated by CP as a single agent, 167-436 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion, repeated every 4 weeks, and 2-4 cycles as a course. The response rate was 75% (6/8) in testicular cancer, 56% (9/16) in ovarian cancer, 63% (15/24) in head and neck cancer, 37% (15/41) in small cell lung cancer and 60% (25/42) in non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphomas. Randomized study of combination chemotherapy containing CP or cisplatin (DDP) was also conducted. The results showed that in small cell lung cancer, 73% (30/41) of the the patients responded to CE (CP + VP - 16) and 67% (24/36) responded to PE (DDP + VP - 16) and in ovarian cancer, the response rate was 60% (6/10) to CAC (CP + adriamycin + cyclophosphamide) and 36% (4/11) to PAC (DDP + adriamycin + cyclophosphamide) regimen. In addition, gastrointestinal reaction and renal toxicity were less severe in regimens containing CP than in regimens containing DDP. However, CP had more marked myelosuppressive effect.","title":"[Clinical results of carboplatin in the treatment of malignant tumors. Clinical Cooperative Group of Carboplatin].","pubmedId":"2177394"}
