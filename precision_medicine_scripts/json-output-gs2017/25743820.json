Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a useful marker for demonstrating thrombocyte function. We aimed to investigate whether c-kit is expressed in benign, preneoplastic and neoplastic endometrial tissues and whether MPV has a relation with c-kit expression and its intensity.\nc-Kit expression was investigated immunohistochemically in 10 samples of normal endometrium (n\u003d10), simple endometrial hyperplasia (5 cases with atypia and 10 cases without atypia), complex endometrial hyperplasia (10 cases with atypia and 10 cases without atypia) and endometrial cancer (EC) (10 cases grade I and 10 cases grade II) and MPV of all cases was checked.\nc-Kit expression was observed at very low rates in cases with normal endometrial tissues (NE) and in hyperplasia without atypia. c-Kit expression and immunostaining were strong in endometrial atypia and EC. MPV levels of complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia (CAEH) (p:0.002), EC grade I (ECG I) (p\u003c0.001) and EC grade II (ECG II) (p\u003c0.001) were significantly elevated when compared with the NE group. Both c-kit expression and intensity of immunostaining had a positive correlation with MPV level.\nWhile c-kit expression and intensity of immunostaining were mildly positive in NE and hyperplasia without atypia, they were clearly observed in EC and hyperplasia with atypia. As c-kit expression is related to the mutagenesis a long-term follow- up may be needed in these cases. A high MPV level may be a good test for demonstrating c-kit expression and intensity of immunostaining.","title":"Relationships between C-kit expression and mean platelet volume in benign, preneoplastic and neoplastic endometrium.","pubmedId":"25743820"}
