Prognostic factors for each disease are based on various clinical pathological features, including clinical stage, tumor size, and lymph node metastatis for uterine cervical cancer. In addition to these factors, recent studies have investigated the role of various molecules including tumor markers and Hb level, apoptosis-related molecules as well as various genetic abnormalities as prognostic factor or indicators for uterine cervical cancer. This molecular background of uterine cervical cancer will shape future directions in the increasingly individualized basis of treatment.","title":"[Prognostic factors of uterine cervical cancer].","pubmedId":"17197743"}
