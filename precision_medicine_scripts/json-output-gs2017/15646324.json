The expression of PTEN of aorta was examined in the aortic-constricted hypertensive rats (hypertension group), in the aortic-constricted hypertensive rats treated with captopril(hypertension and captopril group), and in the rats having undergone sham operation (control group). At day 28 after surgery, the aortas were collected from the groups. The expression of PTEN mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The expression and location of PTEN protein were determined by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the expression of PTEN in aorta of the hypertension group was significantly lower than that of the hypertension and captopril group, and similarly lower than that of the control group. The intensity of PTEN-positive immunohistochemical production in aorta of the hypertension group was weaker than that of the hypertension and captopril group, and likewise, it was weaker than the control. PTEN-positive immunohistochemical production was located in VSMC of aorta. The findings indicated that the expression of PTEN is reduced in hypertensive aorta, that the reduced PTEN experession can be reversed by captopril treatment, that AngII and the increased mechanical strain may participate in regulating expression of PTEN, and that PTEN may play a role in the arterial remodeling induced by hypertension.","title":"[Effect of captopril on expression of PTEN in aorta of aortic-induced hypertensive rats].","pubmedId":"15646324"}
