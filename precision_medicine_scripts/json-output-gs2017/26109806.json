Cell apoptosis of MGC-803 cells was measured using flow cytometry, DAPI staining assay and caspase-3 activity assay. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of microRNA-124 (miR-124) in response to paeoniflorin. The expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), phospho-Akt (p-Akt) and phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) were also measured by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in normal, miR-124 and anti-miR-124 over-expressing MGC-803 cells, treated with paeoniflorin.\nPaeoniflorin was found to inhibit MGC-803 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Paeoniflorin treatment was associated with the induction of apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in MGC-803 cells. Paeoniflorin treatment significantly increased miR-124 levels and inhibited the expression of PI3K, Akt, p-Akt and p-STAT3 in MGC-803 cells. Interestingly, the over-expression of miR-124 inhibits PI3K/Akt and phospho-STAT3 expressions in MGC-803 cells. PI3K agonist (IGF-1, 1 μg/10 μL) or over-expression of STAT3 reversed the effect of paeoniflorin on the proliferation of MGC-803 cells. Over-expression of anti-miR-124 in MGC-803 cells reversed paeoniflorin-induced up-regulation.\nIn summary, the in vitro data suggest that paeoniflorin is a potential novel therapeutic agent against gastric carcinoma, which inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis through the up-regulation of miR-124 and suppression of PI3K/Akt and STAT3 signaling.","title":"Paeoniflorin inhibits human gastric carcinoma cell proliferation through up-regulation of microRNA-124 and suppression of PI3K/Akt and STAT3 signaling.","pubmedId":"26109806"}
