Although morphologically similar tumors may be heterogeneous at the level of the genome, some tumor types have shown relatively frequent and consistent abnormalities of specific oncogenes. In order to determine the frequency of oncogene amplification and rearrangement in several types of human sarcomas and to determine if histologically similar tumors have common genetic alterations, we analyzed 26 primary sarcomas by Southern hybridization. The oncogene probes utilized were N- and H-ras, sis, EGF-R (erb-B-1), neu (erb-B-2), fos, N- and c-myc, mos, and yes. The tumors studied included: five rhabdomyosarcomas (one alveolar, four embryonal), six malignant fibrous histiocytomas, six leiomyosarcomas, four liposarcomas, two Ewing\u0027s sarcomas, one osteosarcoma, and two fibrosarcomas. Oncogene abnormalities were identified in three tumors. One rhabdomyosarcoma showed 12-fold amplification and concurrent rearrangement of sis. This particular tumor also revealed rearrangement of H-ras and 15-fold amplification of c-myc. A second rhabdomyosarcoma revealed rearrangement of neu. A liposarcoma had a sis rearrangement. These findings suggest that many sarcomas show no common structural oncogene abnormalities. The presence of differing oncogene alterations within the rhabdomyosarcoma group indicates genetic heterogeneity among histologically similar sarcomas. The finding of a sis rearrangement in both a liposarcoma and a rhabdomyosarcoma, however, may suggest common oncogenesis among different tumor types.","title":"Genomic alterations in sarcomas: a histologic correlative study with use of oncogene panels.","pubmedId":"1495946"}
