The prognostic impact of these mutations is less clear. This study aimed to assess the correlation of KRAS/BRAF status with morphological characteristics and its prognostic impact for long-term outcome in UICC stage III colon cancer (CC). Methods: FFPE material from 493 patients treated with adjuvant 5-FU/FA in the PETACC2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00004150) was collected retrospectively. KRAS mutations were detected by direct sequencing (ABI Prism 310), BRAF mutations by pyrosequencing (Pyromark Q24). Statistical analysis was done using Fisher exact test and Kaplan Meier survival analyses (level of significance:0.05). Results: Neither KRAS nor BRAF mutations were associated with patient age or patient sex. KRAS mutations did also not correlate with any pathological parameters. BRAF mutations, however, were significantly more frequent in mucinous (n \u003d 12/45; 26.7%) than in nonmucinous carcinomas (n \u003d 36/408; 8.8%, p \u003d 0.001). BRAF mutations were also associated with higher pT stage (p \u003d 0.016): while pT1 and pT2 tumors showed BRAF mutations in 0 (n \u003d 0/13) and 5.1% (n \u003d 2/39), pT3 and pT4 tumors showed them in 9.2% (n \u003d 32/347) and 20.2% (n \u003d 17/84). BRAF-mutation frequency increased with decreasing histologic differentiation (p \u003d 0.002): only 1.9% of grade 1 (n \u003d 1/35) and 8.2% of grade 2 (n \u003d 26/316) whereas 18.8% of the grade 3 tumors (n \u003d 24/128) had a BRAF mutation. Location in the right-sided colon was correlated with BRAF mutation (p \u003d 0.034): 15.4% of the right-sided tumors (n \u003d 23/149) showed a mutation as opposed to 8.4% of the left sided tumors (n \u003d 25/298). Neither KRAS nor BRAF status showed any impact on disease-free and overall survival in univariate analyses. After 3 years, 63% of the patients with KRAS mutation, 68% with KRAS/BRAF wildtype (HR 0.89) and 65% with BRAF mutation (HR 1.08) were still alive. Conclusions: KRAS/BRAF status has no prognostic impact in stage III CC treated with adjuvant 5-FU/FA therapy. While BRAF mutations are associated with tumor location, histological type, differentiation and pT stage, KRAS mutations are not.","title":"Lessons from PETACC 2: No prognostic impact of KRAS-/BRAF-status in stage III colon cancer treated with adjuvant 5-FU monotherapy.","pubmedId":"ASCO_43481-74"}
