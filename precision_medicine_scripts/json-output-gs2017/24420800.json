End-stage lung disease is the most frequent cause of death, however since therapeutic options have improved the life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis, increased incidences of gastrointestinal tumors including pancreatic carcinoma have been reported in several cohort studies from the USA and Europe. We report about a 35-year-old male patient who died from cystic fibrosis with a pancreatic carcinoma, which was histologically confirmed by autopsy. Additionally a low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) was diagnosed.
