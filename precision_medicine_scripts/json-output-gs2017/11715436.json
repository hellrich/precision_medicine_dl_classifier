It was estimated that these mutations would lead to produce truncated protein.\nPoint mutation in STK11 may be chief in Chinese with PJS and the frequency of mutation was fewer than that in previous reports. It suggested that there may be genetic heterogeneity in PJS.","title":"[STK11 gene mutation in Chinese with PJS].","pubmedId":"11715436"}
