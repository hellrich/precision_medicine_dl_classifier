The miRNA (GSE32678) and mRNA (GSE32676) expression profiles of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and healthy controls were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed miRNA and differentially expressed genes were identified by analyzing the microarray algorithm after data preprocessing. Functional analysis was conducted by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Analysis. miRNA-mRNA regulation pairs were obtained in TarMir database. The node degree of hsa-miR-200c, hsa-miR-429, and hsa-miR-200b (miRNA), and EFNB2, MYRIP, and PHF17 (mRNA) were extremely high in the miRNA-mRNA network, indicating that these miRNA and mRNA may play a key role in the development of pancreatic cancer. Our study screened out some target miRNAs and mRNAs for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which may be helpful in its diagnosis and treatment.
