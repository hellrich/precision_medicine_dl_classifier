One-hundred and twenty-nine papillary thyroid microcarcinomas were tested for BRAF(V600E) mutation by single-strand conformation polymorphism, and their clinicopathologic features (age, sex, tumor size, multifocality, nodal metastases, histologic subtype, tumor cell morphology, architecture, tumor-associated stromal reaction, tumor interface to non-neoplastic thyroid (well circumscribed vs infiltrative), extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion, intratumoral multinucleated giant cells, and adjacent non-neoplastic thyroid pathology) were examined. Compared with tumors without the mutation (39/129, 30%), the mutated microcarcinomas (90/129, 70%) showed significantly higher prevalence of infiltrative tumor borders (78/90 vs 23/39, P\u003d0.001), tumor-associated stromal desmoplasia/fibrosis and/or sclerosis (80/90 vs 25/39, P\u003d0.002), classic nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma (90/90 vs 35/39, P\u003d0.008) and cystic change (43/90 vs 11/39, P\u003d0.05). BRAF(V600E) mutation was more frequent in classic (75%), tall cell (91%), and other variants (\u003e70%) than in follicular variant (21%) of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. Tumors without the mutation were significantly more likely to be solid, well circumscribed, and lacked desmoplasia/fibrosis or sclerosis. However, on multivariate analysis, only the follicular variant of papillary microcarcinoma was significantly associated with the absence of mutation (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.09 (0.01-0.54)). Lymph node metastases (n\u003d24) were more frequent in microcarcinomas with mutation than without (21/24 vs 3/24, P\u003d0.02). All patients with lateral cervical node metastasis (n\u003d9), and all but one tumor with extrathyroidal extension (n\u003d17/18) showed BRAF(V600E) mutation. No significant differences were noted in age, sex, tumor size, multifocality, lymphovascular invasion, psammoma bodies, stromal calcification, intratumoral multinucleated osteoclastic-type giant cells, and lymphocytic infiltration between the two groups of tumors. BRAF(V600E) mutation is an early event in thyroid carcinogenesis, and is associated with distinctive morphology and aggressive features even in papillary thyroid microcarcinomas.","title":"BRAFV600E mutation in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma: a genotype-phenotype correlation.","pubmedId":"22918165"}
