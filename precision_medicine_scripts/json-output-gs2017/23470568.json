Loss of p16 and Smad4/Dpc4 immunolabeling was identified in 67.0% and 60.4%, respectively. Loss of p16 immunolabeling was associated with lymphatic invasion (P \u003d 0.012) and postoperative widespread metastases (P \u003c 0.001). A significant correlation was found between Smad4/Dpc4 immunolabeling and tumor size (P \u003d 0.006), lymphatic invasion (P \u003d 0.033), and lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.006). Interestingly, all of the 6 patients demonstrating 5-year survival had intact SMAD4/DPC4. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.001), lymphatic invasion (P \u003d 0.008), the tumor (T) factor (T3 vs. T1/T2, P \u003d 0.004), loss of p16 immunolabeling (P \u003d 0.029), and loss of Smad4/Dpc4 immunolabeling (P \u003c 0.001) were significantly associated with shorter overall survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that loss of Smad4/Dpc4 immunolabeling was an independent and significant poor prognostic factor for overall and disease-free survival. On analysis of combinations of the status of these 3 genes, increasing number of alterations reflected poorer survival.\nGenetic alterations of these 3 genes and their accumulation are strongly associated with malignant behavior of PDAC. Their immunohistochemical assessment at the time of diagnosis may provide a new prognostic tool, assisting in deciding optimal therapeutic strategies for patients.","title":"Immunohistochemically detected expression of 3 major genes (CDKN2A/p16, TP53, and SMAD4/DPC4) strongly predicts survival in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"23470568"}
