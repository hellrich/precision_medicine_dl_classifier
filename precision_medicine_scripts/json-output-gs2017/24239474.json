On Univariate analysis, expression levels of p-mTOR and p-4E-BP1, in addition to the C-reactive protein level, pathological stage, and microvascular invasion, were identified as significant predictors for disease recurrence. Of these factors, the expression of p-4E-BP1, C-reactive protein level, and pathological T stage appeared to be independently related to recurrence-free survival on multivariate analysis. Moreover, significant differences were observed in recurrence-free survival according to the positive numbers of these 3 independent factors; that is, disease recurrence developed in 5 of 42 patients with negative results for any risk factor (11.9%), 23 of 50 patients with positive results for a single risk factor (46.0%), and 31 of 45 patients with positive results for 2 or 3 risk factors (68.8%).\nThe combined evaluation of the expression levels of potential markers in the mTOR signaling pathway, particularly p-4E-BP1, in RCC specimens with conventional prognostic parameters would contribute to the accurate prediction of disease recurrence following radical nephrectomy for nonmetastatic RCC.","title":"Expression of molecular markers associated with the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma: Effect on prognostic outcomes following radical nephrectomy.","pubmedId":"24239474"}
