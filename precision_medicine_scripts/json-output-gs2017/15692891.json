Clinical and histopathological information useful for prognosis was examined, such as anterior border localization, size and shape of the tumor, associated ocular pathology, cell type and degree of extraocular extension.\nSeven patients out of a total of 160 diagnosed with melanoma presented with ocular hypertension (4.3% of the total). Six tumors were large, with only one of them being middle-size. All cases had an associated asymmetric cataract on the affected side. Four cases had neovascular glaucoma, two pseudo-phacolytic glaucoma and the remaining case had invasion of the anterior chamber angle. All cases were unresponsive to medical treatment for glaucoma, due to the unsuspected tumor they harbored. Visual acuity was lower than 0.1 in the affected eye in all patients. Only one case had extraocular extension. A histopathologic examination performed in six cases showed that 3 tumors had epithelioid cellularity and also 3 had varying degrees of extrascleral extension.\nIn patients presenting with the association of unilateral glaucoma and asymmetric cataract, it is crucial to perform imaging studies, such as ultrasound, in order to rule out the presence of an intraocular tumor, and to achieve an early diagnosis, improving the patient\u0027s prognosis and the morbidity of treatments.","title":"[Ocular hypertension as the principal indicator of onset of uveal melanoma].","pubmedId":"15692891"}
