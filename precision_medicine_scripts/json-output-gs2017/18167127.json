Here, on prostate adenocarcinoma specimens from 80 patients, we demonstrate that BRCA2 protein is lost in carcinoma cells compared to normal and hyperplastic prostate epithelium. Using highly metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cells, we show that while BRCA2 depletion by small-interfering RNA promoted migration onto the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin, laminin, and collagens, as well as invasion through the reconstituted basement membrane matrix Matrigel by more than 140%, recombinant BRCA2 overexpression decreased both phenomena by 57-80% and changed cell morphology from angular and spindle to round and compact. The BRCA2 inhibitory effect on cancer cell migration and invasion resulted from down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 protein levels due to increased MMP-9 proteolysis, and was signaled through inhibition of PI3-kinase/AKT and activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. In BRCA2-overexpressing PC-3 cells, transient transfection with a constitutively active PI3-kinase mutant or treatment with the MAPK/ERK inhibitor PD98059 rescued MMP-9 levels and restored the migratory and invasive capabilities. Consistently, PI3-kinase inhibition with a dominant-negative mutant or MAPK/ERK activation with a gain-of-function mutant reduced MMP-9 levels and prevented migration and invasion in wild-type PC-3 cells. These results provide novel evidence showing that a functional BRCA2 protein may limit the metastatic potential of neoplastic cells by down-regulating MMP-9 production through inhibition of PI3-kinase/AKT and activation of MAPK/ERK, effectively hindering cancer cell migration and invasion.","title":"Loss of BRCA2 promotes prostate cancer cell invasion through up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9.","pubmedId":"18167127"}
