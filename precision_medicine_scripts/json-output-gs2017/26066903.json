We review clinical data evaluating first-line treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Additionally, by undertaking an integrated \u0027bench-to-bedside\u0027 approach, we provide potential models, testable hypotheses and biological rationales that might account for these clinical observations.\nA literature search encompassing PubMed and the ASCO/ESMO websites was undertaken in October 2014. Search terms included \u0027colorectal cancer\u0027, \u0027cetuximab\u0027, \u0027panitumumab\u0027 and \u0027bevacizumab\u0027.\nA number of clinical studies indicate a survival benefit for patients receiving EGFR inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line setting, relative to both chemotherapy alone and VEGF inhibitors plus chemotherapy. Existing preclinical and clinical data suggest that a biological basis exists for providing RAS-wild-type patients with first-line EGFR inhibitors, followed by second-line VEGF inhibitors. More specifically, first-line treatment with EGFR inhibitors may elicit unique biological changes that sensitize tumors to subsequent lines of therapy; conversely, first-line treatment with VEGF inhibitors may elicit biological changes that desensitize tumors to subsequent lines of therapy.","title":"The importance of optimal drug sequencing in metastatic colorectal cancer: biological rationales for the observed survival benefit conferred by first-line treatment with EGFR inhibitors.","pubmedId":"26066903"}
