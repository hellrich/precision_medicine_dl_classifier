We retrospectively studied 136 pancreatic cancer patients with available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from 2003 to 2009 to understand the clinical significance of KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. KRAS mutations were analyzed by sequencing codons 12, 13, and 61. In this study, 71 (52.2%) of the 136 pancreatic adenocarcinomas examined harbored a point mutation in codons 12 (n \u003d 70) and 61 (n \u003d 1) of KRAS. KRAS mutation was not associated with clinicopathologic parameters. Patients with KRAS mutations showed a worse response (11.3%) than those with wild-type KRAS (26.2%) and poor survival (mutant KRAS, 5.8 months vs. wild-type KRAS, 8.0 months; P \u003d 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed good prognostic factors for overall survival as well to moderately differentiated histology (P \u003c 0.001; HR \u003d 0.437, 95% CI: 0.301-0.634), locally advanced disease (P \u003c 0.001; HR \u003d 0.417, 95% CI: 0.255-0.681), response to first-line chemotherapy (P \u003d 0.003; HR \u003d 0.482, 95% CI: 0.297-0.780), and wild-type KRAS (P \u003d 0.001; HR \u003d 0.523, 95% CI: 0.355-0.770). However, the observed survival advantage is derived from the subgroup of patients treated with gemcitabine/erlotinib (9.7 vs. 5.2 months; P \u003d 0.002), whereas no survival difference based on KRAS mutation status is obvious in the other subgroup of patients treated without erlotinib (7.0 vs. 7.0 months; P \u003d 0.121). These results need to be further explored in upcoming prospective studies to provide a rationale for personalized medicine in pancreatic cancer.","title":"Impact of KRAS mutations on clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients treated with first-line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"21862683"}
