ALK rearrangement was further confirmed by FISH.\nTwenty-nine of 404 lung ADCs (7.2%) were positive for ALK by IHC. ALK positive tumor cells demonstrated strong and diffused granular cytoplasmic staining. All the ALK IHC-positive cases were confirmed to harbor ALK rearrangement by FISH. None of the ALK IHC-negative cases was FISH-positive.\nIHC can effectively detect ALK rearrangement in lung cancer. It may provide a reliable and cost-effective diagnostic approach in routine pathologic laboratories for the identification of suitable candidates for ALK-targeted therapy.","title":"[ALK fusion gene assessment by fully automatic immunohistochemistry in non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"24742568"}
