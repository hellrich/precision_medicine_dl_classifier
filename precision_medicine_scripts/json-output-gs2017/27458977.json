This study was to identify the biomarkers associated with the progression, poor prognosis and chemoresistance of PDAC.\nmiR-34a and miR-150 levels in the plasma and tissues from PDAC patients were measured by real-time PCR. Xenograft PDAC tumor models were established in mice by inoculation of CD133+ stem cells isolated from PDAC tumors. Protein expression was measured by Western blot.\nThe plasma miR-34a and miR-150 levels were significantly lower in PDAC patients than in patients with benign pancreatic lesions and in healthy subjects. The miR-34a and miR-150 levels in the tumor tissues were significantly lower than in pancreatic tissues with benign lesions. The protein levels of CD133, Notch1, Notch2 and Notch4 receptors in PDAC tumor tissues were significantly higher than in pancreatic tissues with benign lesions. miR-34a injection significantly inhibited the tumor growth of PDAC tumors and sensitized the anticancer effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). miR-34a significantly inhibited Notch1, Notch2 and Notch4 expression in xenograft tumor tissues in vivo and BxPC-3 cells in vitro. miR-34a and miR-150 significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation, invasion and migration in BxPC-3 cells. miR-34a, but not miR-150, significantly sensitized the anticancer effect of 5-FU in BxPC-3 cells in vitro.\nA loss of expression of miR-34a, but not of miR-150, is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis in PDAC patients, and may be involved in the chemoresistance of PDAC cells.","title":"The Clinical Significance of miR-34a in Pancreatic Ductal Carcinoma and Associated Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms.","pubmedId":"27458977"}
