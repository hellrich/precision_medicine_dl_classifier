The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of the BRAF (V600E) mutation and the expression of p53 in PTC, as well as to determine any associations between these two factors and the clinicopathological features of PTC. The study was performed on 66 PTC patients who underwent surgical tumor resection between January and December 2012. Polymerase chain reaction-based DNA amplification was used to analyze extracted DNA from the tumor specimens in order to determine the prevalence of the BRAF (V600E) mutation. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis was employed in order to evaluate the protein expression of p53 in sections of tumor tissue. Furthermore, statistical analysis was performed in order to determine any associations among the BRAF (V600E) mutation prevalence, p53 overexpression and the clinicopathological features of PTC patients, including age, gender, tumor size, multiplicity, lymph node metastasis and extrathyroidal extension. The results revealed that the BRAF (V600E) mutation was observed in 50 (75.8%) of the 66 PTC patients and overexpression of p53 was found in 52 (78.8%) of 66 cases. No significant correlations were observed between the BRAF (V600E) mutation or p53 protein overexpression and the clinicopathological features of patients. However, the BRAF (V600E) mutation demonstrated noteworthy, but non-significant, correlations with the overexpression of p53 (P\u003d0.0854) and extrathyroidal extension (P\u003d0.0661). In addition, a significant correlation was observed between lymph node metastasis and bilaterality (P\u003d0.0280). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the BRAF (V600E) mutation and overexpression of p53 were not significantly correlated with clinicopathological features of PTC, although notable associations were identified between BRAF (V600E) mutation and overexpression of p53 as well as extrathyroidal extension. In addition, lymph node metastasis was significantly associated with bilaterality.","title":"Associations of the BRAF (V600E) mutation and p53 protein expression with clinicopathological features of papillary thyroid carcinomas patients.","pubmedId":"26622769"}
