Diagnostics and treatment modalities are complex and require close interdisciplinary work-up. However, surgical resection currently offers the only potentially curative treatment option. Improved peri-operative strategies as well as optimized surgical techniques have generated significantly increased survival chances for patients in recent years. Complete tumor resection is the key parameter to long-term survival. In spite of expanded surgical limits R0 resection cannot be achieved in some cases as parenchymal disease may limit the extent of resection. Although liver transplantation (LT) is not a standard therapy for CCA today, it may be an option in such selected cases. Protocols including neo-adjuvant radio-chemotherapy and staging-lymphadenectomy before LT have generated impressive results in the recent past. Since palliative options generate only short-term survival extension LT for CCA has lately been discussed more extensively after the procedure had been abandoned due to dismal survival data in the 1990-years. This review offers a comprehensive picture of the current surgical treatment option for cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Role of surgery in cholangiocarcinoma: From resection to transplantation.","pubmedId":"25966429"}
