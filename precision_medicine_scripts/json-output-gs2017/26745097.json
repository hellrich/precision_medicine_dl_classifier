We have studied the effects of 1μM DOX and 500 μM 2DG on radiation induced cell death, apoptosis and also on the expression levels of p53 and PTEN genes in T47D and SKBR3 breast cancer cells irradiated with 100, 150 and 200 cGy x-rays. DOX and 2DG treatments resulted in altered radiation-induced expression levels of p53 and PTEN genes in T47D as well as SKBR3 cells. In addition, the combination along with IR decreased the viability of both cell lines. The radiobiological parameter (D0) of T47D cells treated with 2DG/DOX and IR was 140 cGy compared to 160 cGy obtained with IR alone. The same parameters for SKBR3 cell lines were calculated as 120 and 140 cGy, respectively. The sensitivity enhancement ratios (SERs) for the combined chemo-radiotherapy on T47D and SKBR3 cell lines were 1.14 and 1.16, respectively. According to the obtained results, the combination treatment may use as an effective targeted treatment of breast cancer either by reducing the single modality treatment side effects.
