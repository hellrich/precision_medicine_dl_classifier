The molecular pathogenesis of this malignancy is still poorly understood and, therefore, we developed a mouse model with conditional inactivation of PTEN and p53 to investigate these pathways in the progression of the disease.â€‰We show that deletion of these two tumor suppressors cooperate in the formation of multiple subtypes of LPS (from well-differentiated LPS to pleomorphic LPS). In addition, progression of the tumors is further characterized by the expression of D cyclins and CDK4/6, which allow for continued cell division. Microarray analysis also revealed novel genes that are differentially expressed between different subtypes of LPS, which could aid in understanding the disease and to unravel potential new therapeutic targets.
