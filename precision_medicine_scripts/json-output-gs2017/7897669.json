The bFGF receptor-1 FGFR1) exists in short and long isoforms due to alternate RNA splicing. Minor alterations in the amino acid sequence have also led to reports of different FGFR1 isoforms in different tissues even in the same species. In the absence of any sequence for heart FGFR1 and accumulating evidence for a role of bFGF in heart growth and differentiation, we cloned FGFR1 from embryonic mouse hearts. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to generate full-length short (2259 base pairs) and long (2526 base pairs) forms of FGFR1 cDNAs which generated 86 and 102 kDa proteins, respectively, following in vitro translation. Embryonic mouse heart FGFR1 differed by seven amino acids from the reported sequence for mouse neuroepithelial FGFR1 and appeared more similar to human placental FGFR1. A single FGFR1 transcript of approximately 4.3 kb was seen in RNA isolated from embryonic as well as adult mouse hearts. There was a decrease (approximately 8.5-fold) in FGFR1 RNA levels in the adult. The majority of FGFR1 transcripts in the adult as well as embryonic heart contained exon IIIc (FGFR1-IIIc) which is associated with isoforms that display the highest affinity for bFGF. However, the relative ratio of short versus long FGFR1 RNA expression was 0.5 in the embryonic heart compared to 5.9 in the adult heart. These results indicate that: (i) structurally distinct short and long FGFR1 isoform RNAs are expressed in the embryonic and adult heart; (ii) FGFR1-IIIc is the major form of receptor expressed in the embryonic as well as adult heart; (iii) the transition from the embryo to the adult stage is associated with a decrease but not absence of FGFR1 RNA expression; and (iv) long FGFR1-isoforms are more abundant in the embryo while short FGFR1 isoforms predominate in the adult.","title":"Cloning and expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 isoforms in the mouse heart: evidence for isoform switching during heart development.","pubmedId":"7897669"}
