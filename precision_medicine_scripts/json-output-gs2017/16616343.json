Patients with PJS are at increased risk for common and unusual types of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal tumors. This review analyzes currently available literature and describes the clinical characteristics of PJS, assesses the risk of malignancy in this disorder, and delineates management and surveillance recommendations for affected individuals.","title":"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and management recommendations.","pubmedId":"16616343"}
