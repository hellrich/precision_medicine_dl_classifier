Immunohistochemical (IHC) test of tissue specimens of metastatic lesions were applied to determine the status of PTEN and p-4EBP1. The correlation betweenclinical efficacy andthestatus of PTEN, p-4EBP1 and clinical features were analysed by long-rank test and Cox regression.\nIn all patients, themedian progression free survival (PFS), ORR and CBR was 4.6 months, 36.7% and 50.0% respectively.Univariate analysis revealed that lapatinib-treated patients with PTEN loss (P \u003d 0.015) and liver metastasis (P \u003d 0.02) had significantly shorter median PFS. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with PTEN lossandliver metastasis had higher risk of diseaseprogression (P \u003d 0.005, 0.006, respectively).\nHER2-positive MBC with trastuzumab-resistance could benefit from lapatinib regimen. PTEN statusand liver metastasis couldpredict theclinical efficacyof subsequent lapatinib therapy. The detection ofrelated biomarkers could provide some referenceto optimize the personal treatment with HER2-positive breast cancer.","title":"[PTEN loss correlates withthe clinical efficacy of lapatinib in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer with trastuzumab-resistance].","pubmedId":"26710948"}
