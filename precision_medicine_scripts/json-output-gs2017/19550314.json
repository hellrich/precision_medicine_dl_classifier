This review describes the mechanism of action of PDT, gives an overview of clinical experience in cholangiocarcinoma and summarizes the results published in 2007 and 2008.\nThe mechanism of action of PDT has been further elucidated. PDT induces an apoptotic, antiangiogenic as well as an immunomodulatory response. Interleukin-6, a bile duct epithelium growth factor correlating with tumor burden, decreases after PDT. The efficacy of PDT was confirmed in a comparative study in the United States. Patients with no visible mass on imaging studies, high serum albumin levels and treatment immediately after diagnosis seem to benefit most from PDT. Although it is recommended to perform PDT in bile ducts without stents in place, illumination through metal stents is possible if the light dose is adjusted. Meso-tetrahydroxyphenyl chlorine is a new potent photosensitizer for PDT of cholangiocarcinoma.\nIn advanced nonresectable cholangiocarcinoma, PDT is the only evidence-based treatment that improves survival when compared with stenting. Therefore, PDT should be offered to those who are unsuitable for surgery.","title":"Photodynamic therapy for cholangiocarcinoma: overview and new developments.","pubmedId":"19550314"}
