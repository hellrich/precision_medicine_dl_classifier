The primary tumor was removed by surgery. Two months later, the patient developed metastasis to the brain, and to the lung four months later. Metastatic liposarcomas to the brain generally are extremely rare. The patient was treated with combination chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dacarbazine (CYVADIC). After she was examined, the former two drugs were alternated with vindesine and ifosfamide, and another regimen with cisplatin and etoposide was given after a three-week interval. As a result, both of the metastases totally disappeared. No recurrent lesion has been noted for two years. Although the role of chemotherapy for liposarcoma has not been well defined and little data support its use in an adjuvant setting, this combination chemotherapy seemed to be effective for advanced liposarcoma.","title":"[A case of metastatic liposarcoma originating in the retroperitoneum successfully treated with combination chemotherapy].","pubmedId":"10065107"}
