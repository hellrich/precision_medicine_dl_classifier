She was diagnosed with left lung adenocarcinoma with lymphangitis carcinomatosa and bone metastases to the frontal bone of the skull and thoracic vertebrae. The lung carcinoma was positive for an EGFR mutation. Because the patient\u0027s performance status (PS) was 0, carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus bevacizumab therapy was initiated and she received zoledronic acid and concurrent radiation therapy of 40 Gy for the metastasis to the thoracic vertebrae. After 2 courses of treatment, the respiratory symptoms had improved. After 6 courses of treatment, a chest CT indicated that the lymphangitis carcinomatosa had disappeared. The serum CEA level, which was 126.2 ng/mL (normal\u003c5.0) before treatment, reduced to 5.0 ng/mL. She was administered 10 courses of bevacizumab as a maintenance therapy; however, the CEA level rose again to 11.7 ng/mL, the lung tumor volume increased, and the metastasis of the frontal bone deteriorated. As second-line chemotherapy, EGFR-TKI was started. However, after 11 months, because of grade 4 liver dysfunction, EGFR-TKI was stopped. She then received fourth-line chemotherapy in our outpatient hospital. This patient has survived 52 months since the initial diagnosis.\nChemotherapy including bevacizumab facilitated long-term survival (52 months) of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma accompanied by lymphangitis carcinomatosa and multiple bone metastases.","title":"[A Patient with Lung Adenocarcinoma, Lymphangitis Carcinomatosa, and Multiple Bone Metastases Who Achieved Long-Term Survival after Successful Treatment with Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab].","pubmedId":"27210094"}
