The K- and N-ras protooncogenes were either not expressed or expressed at low levels. No amplification or rearrangement of the three ras genes was detected among the 104 breast carcinoma DNAs tested. These results indicate that the overexpression of H-ras in human breast tumors is not correlated with alteration of the protooncogene. In addition, we did not find any point mutation at the codon 12 of the H-ras or K-ras protooncogenes in 32 and 64, respectively, tumor DNAs examined. However, in tumor DNAs from 14 of 51 patients, heterozygous for H-ras-1 related BamHI restriction fragments, one allele was lost. This allele loss did not alter ras Mr 21,000 protein expression. Correlation with clinicopathological data showed, however, that the loss of one H-ras-1 allele in breast carcinoma DNAs is significantly linked to histological Grade III tumors, the lack of estrogen and/or progesterone receptors, and the subsequent occurrence of distal metastasis. Our results thus indicate that the loss of one H-ras-1 allele correlates with the most aggressive primary carcinomas of the breast.","title":"Loss of a c-H-ras-1 allele and aggressive human primary breast carcinomas.","pubmedId":"3524819"}
