For colon cancer, fluorouracil (5-FU) combined with leucovorin is a current standard of care that improves long-term survival. A recent European trial (MOSAIC) has documented significant improvement in 3-year disease-free survival when oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) was added to infusional 5-FU and leucovorin in the FOLFOX regimen. Two US cooperative group trials will evaluate the addition of antiangiogenesis therapy with bevacizumab (Avastin) to chemotherapy. A third trial will evaluate FOLFOX, irinotecan (Camptosar) combined with infusional 5-FU and leucovorin (FOLFIRI), and the sequential use of FOLFOX followed by FOLFIRI. In rectal cancer, postoperative 5-FU-based chemotherapy combined with irradiation can improve both local tumor control and survival. The German Rectal Cancer Group has recently reported that preoperative combined-modality therapy is less toxic and more effective in preventing local tumor relapse compared to similar treatment given postoperatively. A coordinated pair of cooperative group clinical trials will evaluate oral capecitabine (Xeloda) as a radiation enhancer in the preoperative setting, and the FOLFOX and FOLFIRI regimens compared to 5-FU and leucovorin following surgery. Predictive and prognostic molecular markers will be studied in these new adjuvant therapy clinical trials for both colon and rectal cancer with the goal of developing future regimens tailored to individual patients. There has been a recent and dramatic increase in the pace of drug development for colorectal cancer which holds promise to further improve curative therapy as part of a multidisciplinary approach in the surgical adjuvant setting.","title":"Current status of adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"15214594"}
