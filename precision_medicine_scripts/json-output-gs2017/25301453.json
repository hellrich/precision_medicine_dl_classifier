It could effectively inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and cause inhibition of invasion in pancreatic cancer cells. At a dose of 15.0 mg/kg, ZLJ33 induced tumor shrink in Mia-PaCa2, Capan2, and AsPC-1 xenografts models by 60.59%, 74.19%, and 71.54% according to the tumor weight, respectively. The effect of ZLJ33 on pancreatic cancer was mainly mediated by inactivation of p-PDGFRβ, p-c-Raf, and p-RET. Treatment with ZLJ33 did not cause side effect of hematology indexes in the pancreatic cancer xenograft model. ZLJ33 could be a potential therapeutic agent against pancreatic cancer.","title":"The molecular mechanisms of a novel multi-kinase inhibitor ZLJ33 in suppressing pancreatic cancer growth.","pubmedId":"25301453"}
