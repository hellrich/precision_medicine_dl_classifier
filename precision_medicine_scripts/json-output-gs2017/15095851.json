Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is the most common type of hereditary colorectal cancer, but its incidence remains controversial, ranging from 1 to 5%.\nThis present prospective, multicentre, nationwide study was aimed at compiling prominent epidemiological and clinical data with respect to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and other familial colorectal cancer forms in Spain, where information is lacking.\nAll patients with a de-novo diagnosis of colorectal cancer and who attended between November 2000 and October 2001 in 25 hospitals all over Spain were registered. Demographic, clinical and tumour-related characteristics of probands, and detailed family history, were obtained.\nA total of 1872 colorectal cancer patients were included. Clinical diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer was established in 46 (2.5%) patients according to the Amsterdam II criteria. Comparison between patients fulfilling either the Amsterdam I or the Amsterdam II criteria revealed no differences with respect to demographic, clinical and tumour-related characteristics. A total of 504 (27.0%) patients had a family history of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer-related neoplasm not fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria (familial colorectal cancer), while 360 (19.2%) patients fulfilled at least one of the Bethesda\u0027s criteria.\nThese clinicoepidemiological data provide a more accurate characterization of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and other familial colorectal cancer forms in Spain, with potential implications in preventive strategies.","title":"Frequency of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and other colorectal cancer familial forms in Spain: a multicentre, prospective, nationwide study.","pubmedId":"15095851"}
