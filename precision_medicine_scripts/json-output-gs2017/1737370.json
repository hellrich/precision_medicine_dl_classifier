In univariate analysis, amplification of c-myc proved to be a significant predictor of reduced relapse-free and overall survival (for both, P less than 0.001). In multivariate analysis for relapse-free survival, c-myc amplification significantly (P \u003d 0.001) added to the prognostic power of tumor size (P less than 0.001), lymph node status (P less than 0.001), and estrogen receptor status (P \u003d 0.003), with the highest relative failure rate (1.8) after lymph node status (2.2). In this pilot study, c-myc amplification was predictive for outcome, especially among patients with node-negative disease or steroid receptor-positive tumors; 51 and 46% differences in actuarial 5-year recurrence rates when compared to patients with tumors with normal c-myc gene copy numbers, respectively. HER2/neu amplification was not associated with relapse-free survival but weakly with shorter overall survival in univariate analysis (P \u003d 0.035). Only in the relatively small subgroup of steroid receptor-negative tumors, HER2/neu amplification may identify those patients with an increased risk of death. In conclusion, amplification of c-myc is an independent powerful prognosticator, particularly in node-negative and steroid receptor-positive breast cancer, whereas HER2/neu amplification may be of limited prognostic value, only in steroid receptor-negative disease.","title":"c-myc amplification is a better prognostic factor than HER2/neu amplification in primary breast cancer.","pubmedId":"1737370"}
