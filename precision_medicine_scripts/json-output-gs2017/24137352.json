The current study presents a case of rare spinal MPE with abnormal hyaline degeneration. The patient was a 72-year-old male with a 10-month history of lower back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass involving the L4 and L5 vertebrae with local bone destruction. The tumor was completely resected. Histologically, the majority of the tumor exhibited low cellularity. A marked change in hyaline was observed in the blood vessels and stroma. In specific areas, the tumor showed reticular or tubular patterning embedded in hyaline materials. The tumor cells were cuboidal to columnar in shape with strong immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein and S-100. A fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene was negative. The results of pathological and immunohistochemical studies were consistent with the ependymal nature of neoplastic cells.","title":"Osteolytic myxopapillary ependymoma with marked hyaline degeneration in a 72-year-old male: A case report.","pubmedId":"24137352"}
