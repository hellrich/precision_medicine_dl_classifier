Chromosomal microarray technology revealed a cancer predisposition due to a terminal deletion on chromosome 19p that includes the tumor suppressor gene STK11. In addition to abnormal lip pigmentation on exam, further diagnostic workup with upper and lower gastrointestinal screening confirmed polyps consistent with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The purpose of this study is to present a full clinical description of a patient with a rare 19p13.3 chromosomal deletion and review the current literature of this newly emerging contiguous gene deletion syndrome. It also supports the screening for complications of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome in all patients with this deletion.","title":"Haploinsufficiency of STK11 and neighboring genes cause a contiguous gene syndrome including Peutz-Jeghers phenotype.","pubmedId":"22987620"}
