On palpation, the unmobilized mass, measuring 5 cm, was located in the left lower abdomen. The barium-enema examination showed the filling defect of the sigmoid colon. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor, measuring 20 x 20 mm, located in the right upper lobe (S3) and a nodule, measuring 3 mm, located in the right lower lobe (S8). At first, we performed sigmoidectomy (D 3) for the colon cancer. Next, performed right upper lobectomy and a partial resection of the right lower lobe. Histopathologically, the one is a primary lung cancer, the other is a metastatic lung cancer. With an increase in colorectal and lung cancer, similar cases as ours seem to increase in number. When we treat multiple lung nodules with malignancy of other organs, we should consider 3 types of cases, 1) only primary, 2) primary and metastatic, 3) only metastatic.","title":"[Simultaneous resection of pulmomary metastasis of colon cancer and primary lung cancer].","pubmedId":"15776735"}
