Anaplastic tumours are high-grade gliomas that may represent the final step in the evolution of a secondary glioblastoma or the initial presentation of an early primary glioblastoma. We sought to determine whether pathological and/or radiological variables exist that can reliably distinguish IDH1-R132H-positive from IDH1-R132H-negative tumours and to identify variables associated with early mortality.\nPatients diagnosed with anaplastic astrocytic tumours were included. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed and immunohistochemistry was used to identify tumours with the IDH1-R132H mutation. Survival was assessed 12 months after diagnosis. Variables associated with IDH1-R132H status were identified by univariate and ROC analysis.\n37 gliomas were studied; 18 were positive for the IDH1-R132H mutation. No tumours demonstrated a combined loss of chromosomes 1p/19q. Patients with IDH1-R132H-positive tumours were less likely to die within 12 months of diagnosis (17% vs. 47%; p\u003d0.046), more likely to have tumours located in the frontal lobe (55% vs. 16%; p\u003d0.015), and have a higher minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (1.115 x 10-3 mm2/sec vs. 0.838 x 10-3 mm2/sec; p\u003d0.016), however, these variables demonstrated only moderate strength for predicting the IDH1-R132H mutation status (AUC\u003d0.735 and 0.711, respectively). The Ki-67 index was significantly lower in IDH1-R132H-positive tumours (0.13 vs. 0.21; p\u003d0.034). An increased risk of death was associated with contrast-enhancement ≥ 5 cm3 in patients with IDH1-R132H-positive tumours while edema ≥ 1 cm beyond the tumour margin and \u003c 5 mitoses/mm2 were associated with an increased risk of death in patients with IDH1-R132H-negative tumours.\nIDH1-R132H-positive and -negative anaplastic tumours demonstrate unique features. Factors associated with early mortality are also dependent on IDH1-R132H status and can be used to identify patients at high risk for death.","title":"Radiological and pathological features associated with IDH1-R132H mutation status and early mortality in newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytic tumours.","pubmedId":"25849605"}
