The size of islets, the number on beta-, alpha-, delta- pp- and IAPP-expressing cells and their ratios in the islets of these tissues were determined.\nIn the normal pancreas, only 50% of the beta-cells while alpha- and delta-cells co-expressed IAPP only sporadically. In tissues from diabetics as well as in zone A, the number of the beta-cells and the IAPP-expressing cells was reduced significantly, while the number of alpha- and delta-cells was increased. In zone B, however, significantly more beta-cell and IAPP-expressing cells and a significantly lower number of alpha-cells were found compared to those in zone A. Significant differences were also found between the specimens from type 2 diabetics and pancreatic cancer relative to the ratios of IAPP/beta-cell, IAPP/alpha-cells and beta-cell/delta-cells.\nThe morphometric data show a decrease rather than an increase in the number of IAPP-expressing cells in PC. Differences in abnormalities in type-2 diabetics and in zone B of PC tissue strongly argue against the role of type 2 diabetes in PC. Rather, the development of diabetes in subjects prone to pancreatic cancer could be a red flag for malignancy.","title":"Morphometric studies in human pancreatic cancer argues against the etiological role of type 2 diabetes in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"20183795"}
