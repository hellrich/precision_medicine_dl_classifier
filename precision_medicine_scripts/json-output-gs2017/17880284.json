AtPI4Kgamma4 and AtPI4Kgamma7 undergo autophosphorylation and phosphorylate serine/threonine residues of protein substrates, but have no detectable lipid kinase activity. AtPI4Kgamma4 and AtPI4Kgamma7 are members of a subset of five putative AtPI4Ks that contain N-terminal UBL (ubiquitin-like) domains. In vitro analysis of AtPI4Kgamma4 indicates that it interacts directly with, and phosphorylates, two proteins involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, namely UFD1 (ubiquitin fusion degradation 1) and RPN10 (regulatory particle non-ATPase 10). On the basis of the present results, we propose that AtPI4Kgamma4 and AtPI4Kgamma7 should be designated UbDKgamma4 and UbDKgamma7 (ubiquitin-like domain kinases gamma4 and gamma7). These UBL-domain-containing AtPI4Ks correspond to a new PIKK subfamily of protein kinases. Furthermore, UFD1 and RPN10 phosphorylation represents an additional mechanism by which their function can be regulated.","title":"Characterization of a new family of protein kinases from Arabidopsis containing phosphoinositide 3/4-kinase and ubiquitin-like domains.","pubmedId":"17880284"}
