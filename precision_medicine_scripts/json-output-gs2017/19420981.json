In 2008, an estimated 34,290 people died from pancreatic cancer and 37,680 new cases were diagnosed. Despite modern treatment, 90% of patients die within 1 year of diagnosis. Pancreatectomy is still the only potentially curative approach, but most patients have incurable disease by the time they are diagnosed, and fewer than 20% are candidates for surgery. In the present paper the English-language literature addressing the medical management in pancreatic cancer was reviewed. Based on these data we will discuss the role of currently used chemotherapy and target therapy in pancreatic cancer, as well as perspectives of the emerging strategies that are arising in order to improve the outcomes of this complex disease.","title":"Medical management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19420981"}
