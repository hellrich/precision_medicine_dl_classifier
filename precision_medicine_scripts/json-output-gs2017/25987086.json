Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent genetic alterations found in the human genome. In the present study, we have examined the ability of the murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) (rs769412) A\u003eG polymorphism in cigarette smokers to predict risk of cancers. Our results showed that of smokers, 87% were found with AA genotype, 10% with heterozygous AG genotype, and 3% with GG genotype. The heterozygous AG genotype was observed in a lower percentage of smokers (10%) as compared to non-smokers (18%), whereas, homozygous AA genotype was observed in lower percentage of non-smokers (81%) as compared to the smokers (87%). The results from present study support the association with an allele and AG genotype in non-smokers. However, further studies are required to establish the role of Mdm2 (rs769412) C\u003eT in cigarettes smokers and diseases.
