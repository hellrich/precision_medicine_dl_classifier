These PI3Ks are heterodimeric lipid kinases composed of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit (p110, p110, or p110). p110 and p110 play distinct roles in PI3K signaling in carcinoma cells. p110 is activated by growth factor receptor kinase signaling. In contrast, p110 was shown to play a role in insulin metabolic action, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, and oncogenic transformation. Cancer cells deficient in PTEN, the tumor suppressor phosphatase that antagonizes PI3K signaling, have been shown to be sensitized to pharmacological inhibitors of p110. As a result, early clinical studies with p110 inhibitors are restricted to patients with PTEN-deficient cancers. However, analysis of data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database revealed that genetic lesions in PTEN or PIK3CA (encodes p110) were significantly and independently associated with increased sensitivity to the p110 inhibitor AZD6284. Among 668 cancer cell lines, 96, 57, and 5 lines harbored alterations in PTEN, PIK3CA, or both, respectively. Among 61 cell lines with IC50 values 2 M, only 25 harbored an alteration in PTEN and/or PIK3CA. Thus, a significant fraction of cancer cell lines (and tumors) without PTEN alterations are likely to be sensitive to p110 inhibition. To explore the role of p110 in PI3K signaling in ER+ breast cancer, we treated cells with the p110 inhibitor GSK2636771 and monitored effects on growth factor-induced activation of AKT and MEK/ERK. We found that p110 inhibition reduced basal pAKT and pERK levels in PTEN-deficient cells. Furthermore, p110 inhibition reduced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-induced pAKT levels and delayed the onset of AKT phosphorylation in both PTEN-deficient and PTEN-wild-type cells. In contrast, p110 inhibition sensitized both PTEN-wildtype and PTEN-deficient cells to heregulin stimulation. These results indicate that p110 desensitizes cells to IGF-1 stimulation and hyper-sensitizes them to heregulin stimulation and suggests that p110 regulates downstream AKT and MEK/ERK activation in response to growth factor receptor activation. Our findings advocate for the testing of p110 inhibitors in cell lines (and tumors) selected based on growth factor dependence and PTEN status.","title":"The p110 isoform of PI3K modulates response to growth factor receptor signaling in breast cancer cells irrespective of PTEN status","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3342"}
