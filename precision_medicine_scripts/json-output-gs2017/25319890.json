Numerical aberrations (deletions and amplifications) and structural aberrations (translocations and fusions) are detectable. Probes bind complementary to the DNA strand of the region of interest. Subsequently, the probes are detected via fluorochromes and appear as colored dots that can be assessed under the fluorescence microscope.In situ hybridization is divided into three steps: pretreatment, hybridization, and posthybridization. Pretreatment opens up the cell membranes for hybridization, so that the probe can bind to the complementary DNA target. Posthybridization includes washing steps to remove excessive probes and detection of probes via secondary marked fluorochromes. DAPI stains nuclei and serves as mounting media.","title":"Analysis of receptor tyrosine kinase gene amplification on the example of FGFR1.","pubmedId":"25319890"}
