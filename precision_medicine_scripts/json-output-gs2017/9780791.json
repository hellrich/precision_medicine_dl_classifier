It continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge because of its form of growth and intimate relation with hepatic hilus structures. While cholangiocarcinomas situated distal to the biliary confluence have well-defined characteristics and treatment, cholangiocarcinomas situated in or proximal to the biliary confluence are problematic. A study was made of the so-called intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas by establishing two types, peripheral and hilar. Their features and therapeutic options are analyzed and published results are reviewed.","title":"[Hilar and peripheral cholangiocarcinomas].","pubmedId":"9780791"}
