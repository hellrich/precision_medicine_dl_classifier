Histological examination determined the predominant subtype according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification. EGFR and KRAS mutations were determined by high-resolution melting and Sanger sequencing. Clinical data were collected from medical records and clinicians. The 178 consecutive patients consisted of 48% males, median age 68 years (range 20-87) and smoking history 78%. The tumour stage was I in 62%, II in 18% and III in 20%. The mutation rates were: EGFR 30%; KRAS 28%. The rate of EGFR mutations in the acinar predominant reference group (n\u003d76), was 37%. The solid predominant subtype showed significantly fewer EGFR mutations [3/33 (9%), odds ratio 0.17 (0.05-0.61), p\u003d0.007]. No differences in mutation rate were observed in other subtypes. No association was found between KRAS mutations and predominant histological subtype. Advanced stage and solid predominant subtype were negative prognostic factors. EGFR mutations can be present in adenocarcinoma of any predominant subtype, however rarely in solid predominant tumours. No association was found between KRAS mutation and the predominant histological subtype.
