GE rate was determined using the (13)C-octanoic acid breath test.\nTLOSR was the predominant mechanism of GOR, triggering 50-100% of GOR episodes (median 91.5%). Abdominothoracic straining significantly increased the occurrence of GOR in association with TLOSR. In infants with GORD, the number of TLOSRs overall was similar to normals but the proportion of TLOSRs accompanied by acid GOR was significantly higher than in normals (16.5% v 5.7%, respectively; p\u003c0.001). Infants with GORD had a similar GE rate to normals.\nIn infant GORD, acid reflux associated TLOSRs are abnormally common and likely to be a major contributing factor to the pathophysiology of GORD. Infants with GORD do not have delayed GE.","title":"Mechanisms of gastro-oesophageal reflux in preterm and term infants with reflux disease.","pubmedId":"12235066"}
