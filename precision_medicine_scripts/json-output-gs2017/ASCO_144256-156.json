However, it is less known whether these BC characteristics are related only to the young patients age or might be related to current /recent pregnancy.  The aim of this study is to analyze and compare molecular characteristics of pregnancy associated breast cancer (PABC) vs. non-PABC in patients up to 40 yrs of age. PABC subgroup is defined as BC diagnosed during or up to 36 months after pregnacy.  Methods:    Since January 2012 to December 2014, 39 patients with PABC (30,7% diagnosed while beeing pregnant) and 50 patients with non-PABC (54% nulliparous) were prospectively registered.   Results:     Median age in PABC subgroup was 32 yrs and 33 yrs in non-PABC. Median time from pregnancy in PABC subgroup was 12 months.   Conclusions:    There is no statistically significant difference in HER2 3+ status (28.2 vs. 34%) as well as luminal A subtype expression.(41 vs.52%).between PABC and non-PABC.   However, there is striking difference in TN subtype between PABC and non-PABC, that is statistically significantly different (30,7 vs. 6.0% Fisher exact testp\u003d0.01).  Although obtain on small group of patients, results are strongly suggestive that PABC might have different mechanism of development than non-PABC. Current/recent pregnancy somehow increase susceptibility for TNBC subtype. This susceptibility seemingly, is not related to the young age itself or pregnancy if pregnancy occurred more than 36 months before BC diagnosis.
