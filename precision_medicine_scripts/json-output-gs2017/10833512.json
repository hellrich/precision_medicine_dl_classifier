The activity of this nuclear exonuclease (exoN) is elevated approximately 6-fold in 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine-resistant leukemia cells as compared with drug-sensitive cells, and it differs between two healthy individuals and among three leukemia patients. exoN is a 46-kDa monomer, requires 50 mm KCl and 1 mm magnesium for optimal activity, and shows a preference for single-stranded over duplex DNA. Its physical and enzymatic properties indicate that exoN is a previously uncharacterized enzyme whose activity may confer resistance to clinical nucleoside analogs in leukemia cells.","title":"A 3\u0027-5\u0027 exonuclease in human leukemia cells: implications for resistance to 1-beta -D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and 9-beta -D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine 5\u0027-monophosphate.","pubmedId":"10833512"}
