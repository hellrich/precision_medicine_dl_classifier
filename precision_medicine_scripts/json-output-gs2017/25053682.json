Immunohistochemistry was performed in paraffin-embedded specimens of tumor mass for the assessment of BRAF V600E. The proportion differences of immunoexpression of BRAF V600E among Dukes\u0027 stage A, B, and C were tested using Chi-Square test.\nthe result of positive BRAF V600E immunoexpression (moderately to strongly positive) in Dukes\u0027 stage A, B, and C were found in 1 of 15 cases, 4 of 15 cases and 13 of 15 cases respectively. BRAF V600E immunoexpression was statistically significant more frequent in Dukes\u0027 stage C (p\u003c0,001, Chi-Square test).\npositive BRAF V600E immunoexpression could be used as a marker of aggresive colorectal carcinoma.","title":"Use of BRAF V600E as a molecular marker in aggressive colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"25053682"}
