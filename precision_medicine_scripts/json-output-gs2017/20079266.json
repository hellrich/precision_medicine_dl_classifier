The levels of PTEN mRNA expression in these tissues were assayed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Data was analyzed with SPSS 14.0 software package.\nMutated exon 5 of PTEN gene was found in 2 cases of advanced OSCC. The expression of PTEN mRNA was detected in all OSCC and paired normal tissue. The level of PTEN mRNA in OSCC tissue (0.36 +/- 0.12) was significantly lower than that of paired normal tissue (0.64 +/- 0.09, P \u003c 0.01).\nThe decreased expression of PTEN mRNA contributes to tumorigenesis of OSCC.","title":"[Mutation and expression of tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10 in oral squamous cell carcinoma].","pubmedId":"20079266"}
