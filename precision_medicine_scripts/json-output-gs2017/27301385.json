In patients with either malignant or transudative pleural effusion, we tested the presence of pleural endothelial progenitor cells. We also measured the number of endothelial progenitor cells in post-surgery pleural drainage of either patients with early non-small-cell lung cancer or control patients with benign lung disease undergoing pulmonary resection. The prospective influence of post-surgery pleural-drainage endothelial progenitor cells on cancer recurrence/survival was investigated.\nPleural endothelial progenitor cell levels were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in pleural effusion of 15 patients with late-stage non-small-cell lung cancer with pleural involvement and in 15 control patients with congestive heart failure. Also, pleural-drainage endothelial progenitor cells were measured in pleural-drainage fluid 48 h after surgery in 64 patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer and 20 benign lung disease patients undergoing pulmonary resection. Cancer recurrence and survival was evaluated in patients with high pleural-drainage endothelial progenitor cell levels.\nThe number of pleural endothelial progenitor cells was higher in non-small-cell lung cancer pleural effusion than in transudative pleural effusion. Also, pleural-drainage endothelial progenitor cell levels were higher in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer than in patients with benign lung disease undergoing pulmonary resection (P \u003c 0.05). Non-small-cell lung cancer patients with high pleural-drainage endothelial progenitor cell levels had a significantly 4.9 higher rate of cancer recurrence/death than patients with lower pleural-drainage endothelial progenitor cell levels, irrespective of confounders.\nEndothelial progenitor cells are present in the pleural effusion and are higher in patients with late-stage non-small-cell lung cancer with pleural involvement than in congestive heart failure patients. Endothelial progenitor cell levels are higher in the post-surgery pleural drainage of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer than in non-neoplastic pleural-drainage fluid. High pleural-drainage endothelial progenitor cell levels in patients undergoing pulmonary resection for early non-small-cell lung cancer predict an increased risk of cancer recurrence and death.","title":"Reduced survival in patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer is associated with high pleural endothelial progenitor cell levels.","pubmedId":"27301385"}
