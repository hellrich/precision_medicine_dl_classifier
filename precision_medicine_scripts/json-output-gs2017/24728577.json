We analyzed a missense VUS located in BRCA2 (p.Asn3124Ile; HGVS: BRCA2 c.9371A \u003e T) present in seven independent high-risk breast cancer families that were counseled and genetically tested in South-West Germany. The VUS was identified by DNA sequencing. We analyzed co-occurrence with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations, segregation, evolutionary conservation, in silico impact prediction, and prevalence in the general population. All carriers of the VUS suffered from breast or ovarian cancer. In two families, an additional high burden of other cancers such as pancreatic, prostate, and gastric cancers was reported, one further family included two cases of male breast cancer. The VUS did not co-occur with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations and segregated in two affected individuals of one family. In contrast to the 7/1,347 (0,5 %) tested high-risk BC families without clearly pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2, none of 3,126 healthy population controls sharing the same ethnic and geographical background were found to carry this VUS (p \u003d 0.0002). In-silico prediction revealed strong evolutionary conservation of the asparagine residue, residing in the C-terminal oligonucleotide-binding-fold-3 region, and a most likely damaging impact of this exchange on the protein structure. The BRCA2 p.Asn3124Ile (BRCA2 c.9371A \u003e T) variant is a rare mutation with a damaging effect on the BRCA2 protein that is strongly associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer risk, indicating its most likely pathogenic nature and clinical relevance.
