Patients were eligible if they had stage IV gastric cancer with a gastric outlet obstruction scoring system (GOOSS) score of 0 (no oral intake) or 1 (liquids only). Self-expandable metallic stents were delivered endoscopically. The effects of stents were evaluated.\nTwenty patients were enrolled and 18 were eligible (15 men, three women; median age, 70 years). Stent placement was successfully performed in all patients, with no complications. After stenting, a GOOSS score of 2 (soft solids only) or 3 (low-residue or full diet) was achieved in 13 (72%) patients. An improvement in the GOOSS score by one or more points was obtained in 16 (94%) patients. The median duration of fasting and hospital stay was 3 (range, 0-9) days and 18 (6-168) days, respectively. Chemotherapy was performed after stenting in 13 (72%) patients.\nGastroduodenal stents are thought to be feasible, safe, and effective for gastric outlet obstruction due to unresectable advanced gastric cancer, with rapid clinical relief and a short hospital stay.","title":"Efficacy of endoscopic gastroduodenal stenting for gastric outlet obstruction due to unresectable advanced gastric cancer: a prospective multicenter study.","pubmedId":"24464867"}
