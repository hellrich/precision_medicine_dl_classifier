Haematogenous spread is an important aetiological factor.\nThe objective was to describe a series of patients with VO and to search for a relationship between preceding bacteraemia and subsequent VO with the same pathogen.\nA retrospective study of all treated cases of VO in a tertiary hospital over a 10-year period.\nThere were 129 cases of VO (involving 125 patients) that received antimicrobial treatment. Eighty-three (66%) were male and the mean age was 59.5 years (range 1 month to 87 years). The vertebral level involved was lumbar in 66 (53%) cases and thoracic in 35 (28%) cases. Seventy-four cases (59%) had a microbiologically confirmed aetiology. The diagnostic yield from procedures was 46 and 36% from blood culture and bone biopsy, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen [38 of 74 (51%) cases]. Nine of 38 (24%) cases of Staphylococcus aureus VO had a preceding bacteraemia with the same pathogen in the previous year.\nStaphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen causing bacteraemia with the ability to cause metastatic complications including VO. The high proportion of cases developing VO following a documented bacteraemia, sometimes many months previously, reinforce the importance of adequate aggressive treatment for bacteraemia. VO must be considered in all patients presenting with back pain up to a year after bacteraemia. Previous bacteraemias with relevant pathogens can help guide antibiotic treatment at presentation of VO and if biopsy cannot be obtained.","title":"Bacteraemia and subsequent vertebral osteomyelitis: a retrospective review of 125 patients.","pubmedId":"20934976"}
