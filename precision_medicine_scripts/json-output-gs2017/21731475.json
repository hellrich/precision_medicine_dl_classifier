Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies revealed that luteolin modified histone H4 acetylation at the PLK-1 promoter suggesting that this bioflavonoid controls gene transcription via an epigenetic mechanism involving histone H4 acetylation. These findings are consistent with the anti-estrogenic and anti-proliferative properties of luteolin in normal and malignant cells.","title":"Luteolin Regulation of Estrogen Signaling and Cell Cycle Pathway Genes in MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells.","pubmedId":"21731475"}
