An I-131 scan revealed multiple areas of increased uptake in the chest. These lesions were found to be metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma. The radioiodine uptake by the metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma of the lungs occurred in the presence of normal thyroid imaging in a patient with a thyroid nodule and papillary thyroid carcinoma.","title":"Radioiodine uptake by metastatic nonthyroidal adenocarcinoma of the lung in a patient with papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"15764888"}
