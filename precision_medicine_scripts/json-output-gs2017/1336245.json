This set of primers was tested in six different caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV)- and Maedi-Visna virus isolates of Dutch, American and Swiss origin. The LTR primers allowed the detection of the corresponding fragments of all isolates. The GAG primers allowed amplification of the corresponding fragments of all but the Swiss Maedi-Visna virus strain OLV. Using the POL primers, one Maedi-Visna- and two caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus strains were detected after one round of amplification. Sequencing of the GAG and POL amplification products and comparison to Icelandic Visna virus and CAEV strain CO revealed total heterogeneity of 38% for the GAG- and 28% for the POL fragment. The virus strains studied fall into two groups which are more closely related to one another than to Icelandic Visna virus.","title":"Genomic heterogeneity of small ruminant lentiviruses detected by PCR.","pubmedId":"1336245"}
