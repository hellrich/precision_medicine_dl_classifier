The mouse in the groups was inoculated with exponential phase AGS cell or PI3K gene silencing cells (100 μl, 5 × 10(6)). After tumour size reaches 0.2-0.3 cm, Tumours in animals of groups were injected with sCD40L (100 μl, 10 mg/kg) or equal volume of saline, thrice each day, respectively. Microvessel density (MVD), apoptosis index, and expression levels of PI3K, Survivin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins in transplanted tumor cells in gastric cancer nude mice were analyzed by utilizing Immunohistochemistry, western blot, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assays. Results showed that combination of sCD40L with PI3K siRNA could significantly decrease tumour size, MVD, expression levels of PI3K, Survivin and VEGF proteins, and increase apoptosis index. It can be concluded that combination of sCD40L with PI3K siRNA provides a promising future for gastric cancer therapy.","title":"Combined effect of sCD40L and PI3K siRNA on transplanted tumours growth and microenvironment in nude mice with gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"22736104"}
