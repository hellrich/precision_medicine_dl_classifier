NEP normally functions to inactivate peptides such as bombesin and endothelin-1, and potentiates the effects of the PTEN tumor suppressor via a direct protein-protein interaction. NEP loss contributes to PC progression. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of using a lentiviral vector system to restore NEP expression in PC cells. Third-generation lentiviral vectors encoding wild-type NEP (L-NEP) or green fluorescent protein (L-GFP) were introduced into NEP-deficient 22RV1 PC cells. Cells infected with L-NEP or L-GFP at a multiplicity of infection of 10 demonstrated NEP enzyme activity of 1171.2+/-4.9 and 17.2+/-5.3 pmol/microg/min (P\u003c0.0001), respectively. Cell viability, proliferation and invasion were each significantly inhibited in 22RV1 cells expressing NEP compared with control cells infected with L-GFP (P\u003c0.01). Analysis of known downstream effects of NEP showed NEP-expressing cells exhibiting decreased Akt and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and increased PTEN protein expression. Finally, injection of L-NEP into established 22RV1 xenograft tumors significantly inhibited tumor growth (P\u003c0.01). These experiments demonstrate that lentiviral NEP gene transfer is a novel targeted strategy for the treatment of NEP-deficient PC.","title":"Lentiviral vector neutral endopeptidase gene transfer suppresses prostate cancer tumor growth.","pubmedId":"17415380"}
