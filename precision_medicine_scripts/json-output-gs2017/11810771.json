Comparison of the parameters was investigated in pharmacokinetics after ear-lobe venous injection of ADM (Group 1) and in combination with DDP or/and MMC (Groups 2, 3, 4). Intracardial blood samples were obtained according to the fixed time and quantity. Dose for each drug was: ADM 2 mg/kg, DDP 4 mg/kg, and MMC 2 mg/kg. Seventeen patients suffering from primary non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma, the central type, confirmed by pathology and cytology comprised the clinical group, all of whom showing single blood supply by angiography, was given bronchial artery infusion. According to the scheduled time and quantity, we sampled blood species via indwelling catheter in the right median cubital vein after the bronchial artery infusion. Dose of the each drug was: ADM 40 mg/m2, DDP 80 mg/m2, and MMC 14 mg/m2. Plasma concentration of ADM was determined by fluorophotometry. Since the cessation of chemotherapy, blood samples were taken from the thoracic aorta via indwelling catheter at 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes; venous blood samples were taken from the right cubital vein through the indwelling catheter at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes, and also at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours altogether at 20 time-spots with 2 ml per sample.\nThe calibration curve was linear from 10 ng/ml to 1,000 ng/ml with r \u003d 0.9983. The relationship standard difference (RSD) within a day was lowered to 2%, and the RSD between days was lowered to 3%. The formula of concentration-time curve for ADM was C microgram/ml \u003d 129.44e(-13.36t) + 0.25e(-0.072t) in animal Group 1, and C microgram/ml \u003d 370.93e(-23.43t) + 0.04e(-0.09t) in Group 4 animal. The formula in the clinical group was C microgram/ml(artery) \u003d 448.61e(-66.62t) + 16.35e(-8.13t)(artery) and C microgram/ml(vein) \u003d 15.69e(-21.66t) + 0.07e(-0.038t)(vein).\nCompared with the conventional chemotherapy in pharmacokinetics, bronchial artery infusion can be used as a treatment for non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma with more effectiveness and less side effects.","title":"[Pharmacokinetics of adriamycin by bronchial artery infusion for non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"11810771"}
