The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of miR-1 in modulating CDKs-Rb pathway during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. A rat model of hypertrophy was established with abdominal aortic constriction, and a cell model of hypertrophy was also achieved based on PE-promoted neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCs). We demonstrated that miR-1 expression was markedly decreased in hypertrophic myocardium and hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-1 interacted with the 3\u0027UTR of CDK6, and miR-1 was verified to inhibit CDK6 expression at the posttranscriptional level. CDK6 protein expression was observed increased in hypertrophic myocardium and hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Morover, miR-1 mimic, in parallel to CDK6 siRNA, could inhibit PE-induced hypertrophy of NRVCs, with decreases in cell size, newly transcribed RNA, expressions of ANF and β-MHC, and the phosphorylated pRb. Taken together, our results reveal that derepression of CDK6 and activation of Rb pathway contributes to the effect of attenuation of miR-1 on provoking cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
