Mutational activation of K-ras is a strong adverse prognostic factor in stage I or II lung cancer and laboratory studies have suggested that ras mutations lead to resistance against ionizing radiation and chemotherapy.\nPatients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung with measurable or assessable disease received chemotherapy with mesna, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (MICE). Archival biopsies, fresh biopsies, or fine-needle aspirations were tested for the presence of ras gene mutations. Associations of ras mutations with clinical characteristics, response to chemotherapy, and survival were studied.\nThe presence or absence of ras gene mutations could be established in 69 of 83 patients (83%). A total of 261 courses of MICE were administered to 62 informative patients, 16 of whom were shown to have a K-ras mutation-positive tumor. The frequency of mutations (26%) and the type of mutations closely matched the pattern we have previously reported in operable disease. Patients with a ras mutation in their tumor were more likely to have a close relative with lung cancer, but other clinical characteristics, such as pattern of metastases, response, and survival, were similar between the ras mutation-positive and ras mutation-negative groups.\nPatients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who harbor a ras mutation may have major responses to chemotherapy and have similar progression-free and overall survival as patients with ras mutation-negative tumors. K-ras mutations may represent one of several ways in which early tumors are enabled to metastasize to distant sites.","title":"Mutational activation of the K-ras oncogene and the effect of chemotherapy in advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung: a prospective study.","pubmedId":"8996154"}
