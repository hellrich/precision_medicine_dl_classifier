Sixteen distinct sequence variants were detected of which 11 were (69%) in exon 11. We have identified two novel disease-causing frameshift mutations (c.4642delAA and c.4926insGACC) in two unrelated patients. Apart from this, fourteen distinct sequence variants were detected in 25 breast/ovarian cancer patients of which 8 (57%) were also novel. These include nine missense mutations, one silent mutation, one-nonsense mutation and three intronic variants.\nThe results of this study suggest that germline mutations of BRCA2 gene account for rather small proportion of Hereditary Breast/Ovarian cancer in Kerala, South India.","title":"Novel germline mutations in BRCA2 gene among 96 hereditary breast and breast-ovarian cancer families from Kerala, South India.","pubmedId":"17503080"}
