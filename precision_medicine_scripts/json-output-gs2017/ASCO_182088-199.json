Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (mIDH1) occur in up to 25% of intrahepatic CC cases. mIDH1 lead to epigenetic and genetic changes that promote oncogenesis via production of the oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). AG-120 is a first-in-class oral inhibitor of the mIDH1 enzyme, and is being tested in a phase 1 study that enrolled 73 patients (pts) with mIDH1 CC who had received a median of 2 prior therapies (range 15). AG-120 has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and clinical activity in this study. Among the 72 efficacy evaluable pts (1 post-baseline response assessment or discontinued prematurely), 6% (n \u003d 4) had a confirmed partial response and 56% (n \u003d 40) had stable disease. Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months was 40% as of Dec 16, 2016. The 500 mg once daily (QD) dose of AG-120 was selected for the ongoing phase 3 study in mIDH1 CC described here. Methods: ClarIDHy is a global, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study randomizing 186 pts with mIDH1 CC in a 2:1 ratio to AG-120 (500 mg QD) or matched placebo (NCT02989857). Key eligibility criteria: nonresectable or metastatic CC; documented mIDH1 based on central laboratory testing; ECOG 01; measurable disease (RECIST v1.1); documented disease progression following 2 prior systemic therapies in the advanced setting, including at least 1 gemcitabine- or 5-fluorouracil-containing regimen; and no prior mIDH inhibitor therapy. Crossover from the placebo arm to the AG-120 arm will be permitted. The primary endpoint is PFS as assessed by an independent review. Secondary endpoints include safety, tolerability, overall response rate, overall survival, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses on plasma, and quality of life as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BIL21, and EQ-5D-5L instruments. An independent data monitoring committee will monitor the data throughout the study. The ClarIDHy study is currently activated at participating sites in the US and will be activated in centers throughout Europe and in South Korea.
