The histologic cell type was serous in 21 cases, endometrioid in 30 cases, clear cell in 31 cases, and mucinous in 22 cases. Additional clinical and pathological information was abstracted from patient records, and pathology review was performed for all cases. Direct sequence analysis of exon 2 of the KRAS gene, containing codon 12, was performed using DNA isolated from all tumor specimens. Sequence analyses of exons 11 and 15 of the BRAF gene were performed for the 22 cases of mucinous ovarian carcinoma.\nActivating KRAS mutations were more common in mucinous tumors (50%) than in all other histologic types combined (5%; P \u003c 10(-7)). Mutation of KRAS was more common in stage I tumors than in advanced stage tumors (P \u003d 0.0004). Of the 11 mucinous tumors with KRAS mutations, 6 were of Mullerian (endocervical) type and 5 were of gastrointestinal type. No mucinous tumor was found to harbor a BRAF mutation.\nThese data indicate that KRAS oncogene mutations exist in several histologic types of invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma, especially stage I tumors, but are common only in tumors of mucinous histology. Mutations are equally prevalent in mucinous ovarian cancers of MÃ¼llerian and gastrointestinal types. In contrast to other solid tumor types frequently affected by KRAS mutation, mucinous ovarian cancers without a KRAS mutation have not sustained alternative activation of this signaling pathway through mutation of the BRAF oncogene.","title":"Role of KRAS and BRAF gene mutations in mucinous ovarian carcinoma.","pubmedId":"12893203"}
