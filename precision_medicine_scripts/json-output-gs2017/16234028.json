We prospectively studied the diagnostic yield of high-resolution colonoscopy coupled with chromoendoscopy for preneoplastic and neoplastic colorectal lesions in patients with HNPCC syndrome.\nThirty-six consecutive asymptomatic patients (mean age, 42 years) belonging to HNPCC families and receiving genetic counseling were enrolled in this prospective study. Colonoscopy was performed in 2 steps. Conventional colonoscopy was performed first, followed by a second colonoscopy with chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine (.4%) dye sprayed onto the entire proximal colon.\nConventional colonoscopy identified 25 lesions (mean size, 4 +/- 3 mm) in 13 patients. Seven lesions, detected in 5 patients, were adenomas, 3 of which were located in the proximal colon. Chromoendoscopy identified additional 45 lesions (mean size, 3 +/- 1 mm) in 20 patients; most of these lesions were flat and hyperplastic. Eleven additional adenomas were detected in the proximal colon of 8 patients, and 8 of these 11 lesions were flat. The use of chromoendoscopy significantly increased the detection rate of adenomas in the proximal colon, from 3 of 33 patients to 10 of 33 patients (P \u003d .045).\nRelative to conventional colonoscopy, high-resolution colonoscopy with chromoendoscopy markedly improves the detection of adenomas in patients with HNPCC syndrome and might help to prevent colorectal carcinoma in these patients with a very high risk of colorectal cancer.","title":"Chromoendoscopic colonoscopy for detecting preneoplastic lesions in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome.","pubmedId":"16234028"}
