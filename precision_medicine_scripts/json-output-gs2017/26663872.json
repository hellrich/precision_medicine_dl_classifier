Current criteria for differentiating multiple lung tumors lack a biologic and molecular basis and may lead to misclassification with impact on survival Objectives We report the case of a female patient with a recent diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma and a previous lung adenocarcinoma submitted to curative surgical therapy 4 years before. As both lesions were resected, were of the same histologic subtype and presented the same immunohistochemistry profile; we decided to perform mutational analysis of the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) gene to differentiate between recurrence and second primary lung cancer. Methods The EGFR gene was screened for mutations in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 using direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products in DNA obtained from paraffin preserved cells from both tumors. Results Mutational analysis of the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) gene, revealed different mutations in each tumor (both on exon 19) allowing the confirmation of the diagnosis of two metachronous primary lung cancers. Conclusions In this patient, mutational analysis of the EGFR gene was superior to histologic and immunohistochemistry characterization in differentiating between recurrent lung cancer and second primary lung cancer; allowing confirmation of the diagnosis of two metachronous primary lung cancers.
