We report a successful pregnancy in a patient who desired fertility-sparing management of invasive cervical cancer and was treated with systemic chemotherapy and conization.\nA 28-year-old nulliparous woman was diagnosed with a large 30-mm-diameter stage IB1 squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The patient received 4 courses of systemic chemotherapy with consecutive low-dose BOMP (cisplatin, bleomycin, vincristine and mitomycin C), which produced complete pathological response assessed by examination of specimens from conization. Two years later, the patient became pregnant, resulting in the birth of a healthy infant.\nThis procedure is one method of conservative management to preserve fertility in invasive cervical cancer.","title":"A case of successful pregnancy after treatment of invasive cervical cancer with systemic chemotherapy and conization.","pubmedId":"16171850"}
