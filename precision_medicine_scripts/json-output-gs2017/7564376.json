Since viable tumour cells are present in the bowel lumen and circulation after curative colorectal cancer surgery, it is unclear what effect such factors may have on tumour recurrence. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in a collagen suspension on perianastomotic tumour growth in an animal model. Significantly (P \u003c 0.05) more animals in the collagen treated groups developed anastomotic tumours. The area of tumour growth at the anastomosis was also significantly greater for the collagen (median 14.7 mm2) and collagen + EGF (median 10.8 mm2) groups compared with controls (median 0.78 mm2). We were unable to demonstrate any promotion of tumour by growth factors alone. Collagen promotes perianastomotic tumour growth in this model and is not a suitable vehicle for growth factor application in colorectal cancer surgery.","title":"Collagen promotes perianastomotic tumour growth in an experimental animal model.","pubmedId":"7564376"}
