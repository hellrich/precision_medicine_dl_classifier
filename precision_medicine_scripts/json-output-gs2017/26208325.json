The heterogeneity of molecular alterations in lung cancer has led to the ongoing discovery of potential biomarkers and targets in order to improve survival.\nThis study aimed to detect alterations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, MET-gene copy number and ALK rearrangements in a large cohort of 956 NSCLC patients of Hellenic origin using highly sensitive techniques and correlations with clinicopathological characteristics.\nMutations were detected in EGFR 10.6% (101 out of 956 samples), KRAS 26.5% (191 out of 720 samples), BRAF 2.5% (12 out of 471 samples), PIK3CA 3.8% (7 out of 184 samples), MET gene amplification was detected in 18% (31 out of 170) and ALK rearrangements in 3.7% (4 out of 107 samples). EGFR mutations were detected in exon 19 (61.4% of mutant cases), exon 21 p.Leu858Arg (19.8%), exon 20 (15.8%), exon 18 (2.9%) and were correlated with gender histology, smoking status and TTF1 staining. p.Thr790Met mutant cases (3.9%) displayed concurrent mutations in exons 19 or 21. Negative TTF-1 staining showed strong negative predictive value for the presence of EGFR mutations. KRAS mutations were associated with histology, the most common mutation being p.Gly12Cys (38%).\nIn conclusion, only 89 patients were eligible for EGFR -TKIs and ALK inhibitors therapy, whereas 257 patients showed other alterations, highlighting the necessity for a detailed molecular profiling potentially leading to more efficient individualized therapies for NSCLC patients.","title":"Comprehensive Molecular Analysis of NSCLC; Clinicopathological Associations.","pubmedId":"26208325"}
