This study was conducted in an attempt to clarify any other mechanisms related to cyclin D1 involvement in the malignant transformation of NSCLC, and we clearly showed for the first time that cyclin D1-related kinases are activated in NSCLC, especially in adenocarcinoma but not in squamous cell carcinoma. The results of this study strongly suggest that enhanced cyclin D1-related kinase activity could contribute to a progression of adenocarcinoma in NSCLC.","title":"Activation of cyclin D1-related kinase in human lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"10574260"}
