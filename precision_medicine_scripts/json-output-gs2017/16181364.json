Such lesions may assume a high risk of malignant transformation. Interval cancers are known to occur in this group. Chromoscopic colonoscopy enhances detection in patients assuming a moderate to high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer.\nTo prospectively assess the efficacy of high-magnification-chromoscopic colonoscopy for the detection of neoplastic lesions in patients undergoing hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer screening.\nTwenty-five asymptomatic patients fulfilling modified Amsterdam criteria underwent \"back-to-back\" colonoscopy. Conventional colonoscopy with targeted chromoscopy was performed initially followed by pan-colonic chromoscopic colonoscopy. Diagnostic extubation times and volumes of normal saline and indigo carmine (IC) were controlled.\nUsing conventional colonoscopy and targeted chromoscopy 24 lesions were detected in 13 patients (20 exophytic/4 flat). Pan-colonic chromoscopy identified a further 52 lesions in 16 patients (17 exophytic/35 flat). Pan-chromoscopy identified significantly more adenomas than conventional colonoscopy (p\u003d 0.001) and a significantly high number of flat adenomas (p\u003d 0.004).\nPan-colonic chromoscopic colonoscopy improves detection of significant neoplastic lesions in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer screening. Pan-chromoscopy may help better stratify colorectal cancer \"risk\" in this cohort and aid planning of surveillance colonoscopic follow-up.","title":"The role of high-magnification-chromoscopic colonoscopy in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer screening: a prospective \"back-to-back\" endoscopic study.","pubmedId":"16181364"}
