LADC harboring EGFR mutation and ALK fusion can be treated with anti-cancer drugs that target the aberrant gene products. These molecularly targeted drugs showed significant positive effectiveness for the LADC patients with EGFR mutations and ALK fusions. Additional oncogene aberrations, including RET, ROS1, and NRG1 fusions, skipping of exon 14 of MET, and mutations in BRAF, HER2, NF1, and MEK1, were recently added to the list of such “druggable” driver oncogene aberrations, and their responses to targeted therapies are currently being evaluated in several clinical trials. On the other hand, about 30% and 50% of LADCs in patients in Japan and Europe/USA, respectively, lack the driver oncogene aberrations listed above. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies, such as those that exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer cells with non-oncogene aberrations, are urgently required. In this presentation, we show gene mutation profiles according to driver oncogenes and summarize the frequencies of those aberrations. We also compare driver aberrations between Japan and USA according to smoking status and sex. This will provide the current status of research on precision medicine against LADC and enumerates the research priorities for the near future.","title":"Gene aberrations for precision medicine against lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-2468"}
