KRAS mutation status was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and correlated with clinicopathological data.\nNinety-eight patients (37%) were positive for KRAS mutations. G12D was the most common mutation with a frequency of 36.7%, followed by G12V (25.5%), G13D (17.3%), G12A (7.1%), G12C (6.1%), G12S (5.1%) and G12R (2%). The frequency of the mutation in left, right colon and rectal tumors was 37.8, 32.6 and 44.9%, respectively. Among tumors with mutations, 86.7% were well or moderately differentiated tumors and the rest were poorly differentiated. No significant associations between KRAS gene mutations and other clinicopathological features of the tumor were observed.\nThe frequencies of KRAS mutations reported in this study are similar to frequencies reported for European and North-American populations, lower than in a Spanish study and higher than in a Peruvian study.","title":"[KRAS gene somatic mutations in Chilean patients with colorectal cancer].","pubmedId":"25694286"}
