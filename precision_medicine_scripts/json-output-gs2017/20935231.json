To determine whether adiponectin modulates levels of lung inflammation in tobacco smoke-induced COPD-E, we used a mouse model of COPD-E in which either adiponectin-deficient or wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to tobacco smoke for 6 mo. Outcomes associated with tobacco smoke-induced COPD-E were quantitated including lung inflammation [bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and total and differential cell count], lung mediators of inflammation (cytokines and chemokines), air space enlargement (i.e., linear intercept), and lung function (tissue elastance) in the different groups of mice. Whereas exposure of WT mice to tobacco smoke for 6 mo induced significant lung inflammation (increased total BAL cells, neutrophils, and macrophages), adiponectin-deficient mice had minimal BAL inflammation when exposed to tobacco smoke for 6 mo. In addition, whereas chronic tobacco-exposed WT mice had significantly increased levels of lung mediators of inflammation [i.e., TNF-α, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), and adiponectin] as well as significantly increased air space enlargement (increased linear intercept) and decreased tissue elastance, exposure of adiponectin-deficient mice to chronic tobacco smoke resulted in no further increase in lung mediators, air space enlargement, or tissue elastance. In vitro studies demonstrated that BAL macrophages derived from adiponectin-deficient mice incubated in media containing tobacco smoke expressed minimal TNF-α or KC compared with BAL macrophages from WT mice. These studies suggest that adiponectin plays an important proinflammatory role in tobacco smoke-induced COPD-E.","title":"Adiponectin-deficient mice are protected against tobacco-induced inflammation and increased emphysema.","pubmedId":"20935231"}
