Human EGFR2 (or HER2) has an established role as a prognostic and predictive factor in breast cancer. Although HER2 deregulation, including overexpression, amplification and mutation, has been described in NSCLC, its role as a therapy biomarker remains undefined. In the last few years, there has been a growing interest on HER2 mutation, with few anecdotal or retrospective studies suggesting a relevant role for this biomarker. This review discusses the prognostic and predictive impact of HER2 deregulation and the clinical implications of anti-HER2 strategies in NSCLC. ","title":"HER2 and lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24134423"}
