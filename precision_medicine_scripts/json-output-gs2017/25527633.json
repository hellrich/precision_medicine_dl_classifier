Predictive biomarkers for patient selection are critical for improving clinical benefit. Coupling in vitro sensitivity testing of BMS-754807, a dual IGF-1R/IR inhibitor, with genomic interrogations in 60 human colorectal cancer cell lines, we identified biomarkers correlated with response to BMS-754807. The results showed that cell lines with BRAF(V600E) or KRAS(G13D) mutation were resistant, whereas cell lines with wild-type of both KRAS and BRAF were particularly sensitive to BMS-754807 if they have either higher RNA expression levels of IR-A or lower levels of IGFBP6. In addition, the cell lines with KRAS mutations, those with either insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) copy number gain (CNG) or higher IGF-1R expression levels, were more sensitive to the drug. Furthermore, cell lines with IRS2 CNG had higher levels of ligand-stimulated activation of IGF-1R and AKT, suggesting that these cell lines with IGF-IR signaling pathways more actively coupled to AKT signaling are more responsive to IGF-1R/IR inhibition. IRS2 siRNA knockdown reduced IRS2 protein expression levels and decreased sensitivity to BMS-754807, providing evidence for the functional involvement of IRS2 in mediating the drug response. The prevalence of IRS2 CNG in colorectal cancer tumors as measured by qPCR-CNV is approximately 35%. In summary, we identified IRS2 CNG, IGF-1R, IR-A, and IGFBP6 RNA expression levels, and KRAS and BRAF mutational status as candidate predictive biomarkers for response to BMS-754807. This work proposed clinical development opportunities for BMS-754807 in colorectal cancer with patient selection to improve clinical benefit.","title":"IRS2 copy number gain, KRAS and BRAF mutation status as predictive biomarkers for response to the IGF-1R/IR inhibitor BMS-754807 in colorectal cancer cell lines.","pubmedId":"25527633"}
