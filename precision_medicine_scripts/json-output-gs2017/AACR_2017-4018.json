As monomeric GTPases, Ras proteins cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Oncogenic mutations in one of the Ras isoforms, H-, N-, and K-Ras, impair GTP hydrolysis, thus de-regulating Ras signaling. Ras mutations are found in one-third of human cancers, and tumors bearing these mutations are notoriously difficult to treat. Conventional approaches to inhibit Ras with small molecules have been largely unsuccessful leading many to characterize the Ras family as an “undruggable” target. However, there is renewed enthusiasm towards Ras drug discovery in response to a recent surge of reports revealing structural complexities to Ras proteins that provide opportunity for innovative drug discovery efforts.In light of findings suggesting KRas contains transient and dynamic binding pockets, many of which are undetectable with traditional structural techniques, we used a second harmonic generation (SHG) platform to screen a ~2700 chemically diverse fragment collection for allosteric modulators of KRas. This high throughput SHG platform enables real-time measurement of protein conformational change under physiological conditions. We selected ~50 fragments for validation by SPR, and positive binders will be selected for structural and biochemical characterization. Another advantage of the SHG platform is that we can monitor the conformational dynamics of fully processed, farnesylated KRas bound to a phosphatidylserine-enriched membrane that mimics KRas’ physiological interaction with the plasma membrane. No other biophysical method is suitable to monitor the real-time interactions of small molecules or proteins with membrane-bound KRas. This analysis may reveal surface contacts unavailable in solution-based assays. We have successfully implemented SHG as a drug discovery platform against KRas, and we aim to utilize selected KRas conformational modulators towards the identification of novel binding pockets and towards the development of targeted KRas therapies.","title":"Identifying allosteric modulators of KRas using second harmonic generation.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-4018"}
