The possibility of using gefitinib as neoadjuvant therapy is interesting because of the low toxicity profile of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here we report the case of a 67-year-old nonsmoking woman affected by locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma, in whom one-year treatment with gefitinib rendered the tumor amenable to surgical removal. The results of ongoing clinical trials exploring the ability of preoperative gefitinib to achieve better results than can be obtained with chemotherapy in patients selected on the basis of EGFR mutations are urgently awaited.","title":"Surgical resection of locally advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated lung adenocarcinoma after gefitinib and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"24362878"}
