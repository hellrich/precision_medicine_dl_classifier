Among these, the CD56-positive lymphoma, presumably of an NK/T-cell nature, is frequently seen in Asian, Mexican, and South American patients. NK cells are proposed to be closer developmentally to T cells than to other lymphoid cells, because bipotential common progenitor cells of NK/T-cell lineage have been isolated. In this study, we collected 47 cases of nasal lymphoma and investigated the phenotypic difference between NK/T-cell lymphoma and PTL by examining the pattern of the developmentally differentially expressed molecules cdk6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 6), CD44, CD117, and by examining the rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene (TcR-GR). cdk6, an essential regulator of the cell cycle in G1 progression, was over-expressed in a subset of cortical thymocytes, but absent in mature thymocytes. In contrast, CD44, a glycosylated adhesion molecule, was absent in cortical thymocytes, but present in mature thymocytes and peripheral activated T cells. We found both over-expression of nuclear cdk6 (n-cdk6) and frequent absence of CD44 in nasal CD56-positive NK/T-cell lymphomas, in contrast to most nasal CD56-negative PTL, which were CD44-immunoreactive with weak or no expression of n-cdk6. Almost all tested cases of NK/T-cell lymphoma displayed a germ-line configuration of TcR, without evidence of gene rearrangement. Thus, there seems to be a useful distinction between the classical NK/T type of nasal lymphoma (CD56+/n-cdk6+/CD44-/TcR-GR-) and PTL (CD56-/n-cdk6-/CD44+/TcR-GR+) involving the nasal region. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus does not seem to be a good marker for distinguishing between NK/T lymphoma and PTL involving the nasal region.","title":"Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (cdk6) and frequent loss of CD44 in nasal-nasopharyngeal NK/T-cell lymphomas: comparison with CD56-negative peripheral T-cell lymphomas.","pubmedId":"10879740"}
