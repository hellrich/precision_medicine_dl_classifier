The first group had no family history of diabetes (FH-, n \u003d 148); the second group had a family history of type 2 diabetes only (FH+(TYPE2), n \u003d 1,211); and the third group had a family history of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (FH+(MIXED), n \u003d 240). Furthermore, we studied the frequency of GAD antibodies (GADabs), HLA-DQB1 risk genotypes, and the presence of coronary heart disease (CHD) according to family history in unrelated patients with type 2 diabetes from 787 families (148 FH-, 546 FH+(TYPE2) and 93 FH+(MIXED)).\nPatients with no family history of diabetes were older at the onset of the disease, had a better beta-cell function (P \u003d 0.004), and had higher HDL cholesterol concentrations (P \u003d 0.006) than patients with a family history of diabetes. Patients with a family history of only type 2 diabetes had higher BMI and fasting C-peptide concentrations (P \u003d 0.031) but lower frequency of GADab (11 vs. 23%, P \u003d 0.001) and DQB1 risk genotypes (37 vs. 54%, P \u003d 0.003) compared with patients with a family history of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In addition, hypertension (P \u003d 0.05) and CHD (P \u003d 0.031) were more common in FH+(TYPE2) than in FH+(MIXED) patients. In patients \u003c60 years old, a family history of type 1 diabetes was associated with a reduced risk of CHD independent of age, hypertension, and HDL cholesterol concentrations. The results were similar when the GADab+ patients were excluded from the analysis.\nA family history of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes had a profound influence on the phenotype of patients with type 2 diabetes, which suggests a genetic interaction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","title":"Consequences of a family history of type 1 and type 2 diabetes on the phenotype of patients with type 2 diabetes.","pubmedId":"10834414"}
