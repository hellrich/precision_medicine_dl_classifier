The Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium reported that BRCA2 mutation carriers are at increased risk for BTC with estimated relative risk of 4.97, (95% CI \u003d 1. 50-16.52). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of germline/somatic BRCA1/2mutations in CCA patients.  Methods:    Multi-center retrospective analysis of patients with germline/somatic BRCA1/2- associated CCA diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2013. Cases were identified from clinical databases at participating institutions. Data including demographics, clinical history, surgical procedures and systemic chemotherapy or radiation were extracted from patient records.   Results:    Overall, we identified 18 cases including 5 carriers of germline BRCA1/2 mutations (4 BRCA2; 1 BRCA1) and 13 harboring somatic mutations (7 BRCA1; 6 BRCA2) using a NGS panel testing tumor for \u0027actionable\u0027 mutations. One patient presented with two different somatic mutations in the BRCA2gene. Mean age at diagnosis was 60 years (range 36-75), male: females (61.2% vs 38.8%, respectively). Stage at diagnosis: I (n \u003d 4), II (n \u003d 3), III (n \u003d 3) and IV (n \u003d 8). Six patients had extrahepatic CAA; twelve patients had intrahepatic CCA. Prior therapy in 13 patients included platinum-based therapy with one patient receiving prior olaparib. Median overall survival for patients with stage I/II is 34.7 months (95% CI, 7.06-62.9) and for stages III/IV is 25 months (95% CI, 12.02-35.84).  Conclusions:    BRCA associated CCA may have an enhanced therapeutic sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. This needs confirmation in a larger cohort of patients.","title":"Overall survival and clinical characteristics of BRCA germline/somatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).","pubmedId":"ASCO_159455-173"}
