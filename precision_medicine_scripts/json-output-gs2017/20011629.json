All individuals were genotyped for 16 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) across the MET gene region. Myopia was defined as -0.5 DS or worse in both eyes and divided into high myopia (\u003cor\u003d-6.0 DS) and low/moderate myopia (-0.5 DS to -5.99 DS). Hypermetropia was defined as at least +1.0 DS in both eyes. Genotyping results were analyzed using PLINK, comparing cases (all myopia, high myopia, low/moderate myopia, and hypermetropia) to controls (emmetropia). Association tests were also performed using the quantitative traits of refraction, axial length, anterior chamber depth, and corneal curvature.\nNo statistically significant genetic associations were detected for any of the 16 tSNPs with refractive error (myopia and hypermetropia) or ocular biometric measures.\nThese data indicate there is likely no genetic association of the MET gene with myopia, axial length, anterior chamber depth, and corneal curvature in this cohort.","title":"The hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) gene is not associated with refractive error and ocular biometrics in a Caucasian population.","pubmedId":"20011629"}
