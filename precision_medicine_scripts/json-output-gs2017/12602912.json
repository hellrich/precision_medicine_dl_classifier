The spectrum of BRCA1 gene mutations in breast cancer patients in various populations has been investigated. In this study, patients in Central Taiwan with breast cancer were screened for BRCA1 mutations by sequencing PCR products spanning the coding region and partial intronic regions of the BRCA1 gene. Twelve polymorphisms in four exons and three introns were found. One mutation was found in one patient with familial breast cancer. Two patients showed LOH at the locus of BRCA1. Also found in the Taiwanese population were two common haplotypes and one rare haplotype of BRCA1. These results suggest that the mutation of BRCA1 contributes little to the occurrence of breast cancer in the Taiwanese population.","title":"Mutational screening of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 from early onset, bi-lateral, and familial breast cancer patients in Taiwan.","pubmedId":"12602912"}
