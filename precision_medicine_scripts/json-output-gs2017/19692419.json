Estrogen has an effect on the growth of lung cancer cell lines. An inverse relationship between ER and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) was reported in pre-clinical data. A 70-year-old female with lung adenocarcinoma, who achieved a partial response by gefitinib, underwent estrogen replacement for menopause-associated symptoms during gefinitib therapy. Lung nodules enlarged with 1-month estrogen use and regressed 6 weeks after the end of estrogen therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first case report regarding the interaction between estrogen and EGFR inhibitors.","title":"Estrogen replacement in female lung cancer during gefitinib therapy.","pubmedId":"19692419"}
