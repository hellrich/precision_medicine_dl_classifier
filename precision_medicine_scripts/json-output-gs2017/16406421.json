The CYP19 gene encodes the enzyme aromatase, which catalyzes the conversion of androgens into estrogens. CYP19 alleles containing different numbers of tetranucleotide TTTA repeats in intron 4 have been associated with increased breast cancer risk. In this study we investigated, for the first time, the frequency of CYP19 (TTTA)n alleles in a South American population (n \u003d 475) and analyzed the risk for developing breast cancer in a case-control study comprising 135 cases and 270 age-matched controls. It is shown that Brazilians possess not only the alleles identified in all the other populations studied so far (alleles containing from 7 to 13 TTTA repeats), but also the (TTTA)6 allele, that had never been described before. The (TTTA)10 allele was three times more frequent in cases when compared to controls and presented a significant positive association (p \u003d 0.048) with breast cancer development in Brazilians.","title":"CYP19 (TTTA)n polymorphism and breast cancer risk in Brazilian women.","pubmedId":"16406421"}
