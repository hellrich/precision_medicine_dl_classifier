Despite the theoretically increased risk in all tissues, Lynch syndrome exhibits tissue specificity, with a particular tendency among affected individuals to develop colorectal and endometrial cancer at a young age. A number of other malignancies, including those derived from the ovary, stomach, small bowel, and urothelium, have also been linked to this syndrome. A growing body of evidence exists to support an association between mismatch repair mutations and a growing spectrum of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer-associated neoplasms. In this article, a previously undocumented mismatch repair-related malignancy in a patient with Lynch syndrome is reported.","title":"Small cell carcinoma: arising in Lynch syndrome: a previously undocumented occurrence.","pubmedId":"18480399"}
