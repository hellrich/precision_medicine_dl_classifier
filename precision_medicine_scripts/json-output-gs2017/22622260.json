However, several exceptional cases harboring both genetic alterations have been reported. In this study, a total of 444 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were examined for their EGFR and ALK status at Seoul National University Hospital between July 2008 and September 2011. EGFR mutations and ALK translocations were detected in 228 (51.4%) and 34 (7.7%) patients, respectively. Four patients (0.9%) had both genetic alterations and three underwent curative surgery. One patient who received both EGFR tyrosine kinase and ALK inhibitors, separately showed an objective response to the ALK inhibitor alone. Considering our and previous studies, patients harboring both EGFR mutation and ALK translocation showed differential sensitivities to both targeted therapies, suggesting a variable dependence on EGFR and ALK oncogenes.","title":"Differential sensitivities to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation and ALK translocation.","pubmedId":"22622260"}
