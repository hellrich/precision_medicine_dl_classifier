Although progress has been made, with advances in chemotherapy, the majority of patients diagnosed with lung cancer ultimately succumb to the disease. A better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer is demonstrating how alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes control lung cancer initiation, growth, and survival. In this article, attempts to target molecular alterations in lung cancer using gene therapy techniques are reviewed. These include introducing suicide genes into tumor cells, replacement of defective tumor suppressor genes, inactivating oncogenes, and immunotherapy-based approaches using gene therapy technology. The major barrier for these techniques continues to be the inability to specifically target tumor cells while sparing normal cells. Nonetheless, these approaches are likely to yield important biologic and clinical data which will further the progress of lung cancer treatment.","title":"Gene therapy for lung cancer.","pubmedId":"14526124"}
