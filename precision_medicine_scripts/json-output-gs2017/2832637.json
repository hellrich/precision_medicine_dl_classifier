Such an association is well described in the textbook, but its true incidence is very low. A review of the literature disclosed only 19 cases of Gardner\u0027s syndrome or familial polyposis coli in association with ampullary carcinoma, three of them in Japan. Whether or not ampullary carcinomas develop de novo or arise from adenoma still remains controversial. In order to ascertain the facts about their origin, more cases need to be collected and the early detection of ampullary lesions may be necessary.","title":"Ampullary carcinoma in Gardner\u0027s syndrome: case report.","pubmedId":"2832637"}
