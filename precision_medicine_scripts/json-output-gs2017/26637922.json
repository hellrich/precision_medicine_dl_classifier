However, it is unclear whether first-generation EGFR-TKIs improve OS in patients with del19 in the first-line treatment.\nWe performed a post-hoc analysis of patients with del19 or L858R mutation of EGFR who received gefitinib in the NEJ002 study, which compared gefitinib to carboplatin-paclitaxel.\nA total of 58 patients and 57 patients with del19 EGFR received gefitinib and carboplatin-paclitaxel, respectively. No OS differences were observed between patients receiving gefitinib and carboplatin-paclitaxel irrespective of del19 (29.3 months vs. 29.7 months, p\u003d0.53) or L858R (28.4 months vs. 25.1 months, p\u003d0.45).\nIn contrast to afatinib, it is suggested that first-line gefitinib does not improve OS in patients with del19 of EGFR compared with platinum-doublet chemotherapy.","title":"Comparison of Gefitinib Versus Chemotherapy in Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer with Exon 19 Deletion.","pubmedId":"26637922"}
