K-ras gene amplification of KCC-1b was more than 10 fold that of KCC-1a and the control. N-myc gene amplification of KCC-1b was more than 3-5 fold that of KCC-1a. c-myc gene amplifications of KCC-1a and KCC-1b were more than 5-7 fold that of the control DNA. 2) p21 was observed in tubular adenocarcinoma but not in clear cell carcinoma. p21 was detected in KCC-1b cells but not in KCC-1a cells. 3) KCC-1a and KCC-1b cells had quite different characteristics in molecular biology.","title":"[Characterization of oncogenes (K, N-ras and N, c-myc) in subcloned cell lines (KCC-1a and 1b) derived from same endometrial carcinoma presenting well differentiated adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma].","pubmedId":"1955783"}
