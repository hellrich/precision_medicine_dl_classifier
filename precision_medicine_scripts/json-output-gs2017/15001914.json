The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgical resection for metachronous lung cancers.\nWe reviewed the charts of all patients who underwent a second resection for a metachronous lung cancer from July 1, 1988, to December 31, 2002. Type of resection, operative morbidity, mortality, and survival by stage were analyzed. Survival was determined by using the Kaplan-Meier survival method. All patients were pathologically staged by using the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer standards.\nPulmonary resections were performed in 69 patients who had undergone a previous resection. The mean interval between the first and second resection was 2.4 +/- 2.5 years. Seventy-three percent of patients presented with stage I cancers, 9% with stage II cancers, and 17% with stage III cancers. Lobectomy and wedge resection were performed with equal frequency (42% each) for the metachronous cancers. Operative mortality for the second resection was 5.8%. The mean follow-up after the second resection was 37 months. Overall 5-year actuarial survival for the entire group after the second resection was 33.4%.\nOperations for metachronous cancers provided survival that approximated the expected survival for lung cancer. Surgical intervention should be considered as a safe and effective treatment for resectable metachronous lung cancer in patients with adequate physiologic pulmonary reserve.","title":"Benefits of resection for metachronous lung cancer.","pubmedId":"15001914"}
