A representative compound 6ab, termed Ki8751, inhibited VEGFR-2 phosphorylation at an IC(50) value of 0.90 nM, and also inhibited the PDGFR family members such as PDGFRalpha and c-Kit at 67 nM and 40 nM, respectively. However, 6ab did not have any inhibitory activity against other kinases such as EGFR, HGFR, InsulinR and others even at 10000 nM. 6ab suppressed the growth of the VEGF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) on a nanomolar level. 6ab showed significant antitumor activity against five human tumor xenografts such as GL07 (glioma), St-4 (stomach carcinoma), LC6 (lung carcinoma), DLD-1 (colon carcinoma) and A375 (melanoma) in nude mice and also showed complete tumor growth inhibition with the LC-6 xenograft in nude rats following oral administration once a day for 14 days at 5 mg/kg without any body weight loss.","title":"Novel potent orally active selective VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors: synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and antitumor activities of N-phenyl-N\u0027-{4-(4-quinolyloxy)phenyl}ureas.","pubmedId":"15743179"}
