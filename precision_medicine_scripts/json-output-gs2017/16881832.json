Information pertaining to signalment, imaging findings, clinical signs, duration of clinical signs, preoperative treatment, location of the tumor, results of histologic assessment, outcome, and necropsy results was obtained from the medical record. Clients and referring veterinarians were contacted via telephone for information on recurrence of clinical signs and postoperative survival time.\n16 dogs were \u003e 7 years of age, and all 17 dogs had seizures before surgery. The most commonly affected breed was the Golden Retriever, represented by 6 of the 17 dogs. Median survival time was 1,254 days. Of the data collected, only histologic subtype of the tumor was prognostic. Analysis of survival times according to histologic tumor subtypes indicated that the order from most brief to longest was as follows: anaplastic, 0 days; fibroblastic, 10 days; psammomatous, \u003e 313 days; meningothelial, \u003e 523 days; and transitional, 1,254 days.\nUse of a surgical aspirator to resect intracranial meningiomas in dogs was associated with longer survival times than those achieved with traditional surgery alone or traditional surgery combined with radiation therapy. Dogs with meningothelial, psammomatous, or transitional intracranial meningioma subtypes appeared to have a better prognosis than dogs with other subtypes of meningioma.","title":"Evaluation of intracranial meningioma resection with a surgical aspirator in dogs: 17 cases (1996-2004).","pubmedId":"16881832"}
