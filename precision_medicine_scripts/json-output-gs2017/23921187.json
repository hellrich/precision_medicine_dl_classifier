The correlation between the expression of histone H3 and clinicopathological findings was analyzed.\nFormalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections obtained from 80 operated cases of colorectal cancer were immunostained with anti-acetylated histone H3 (H3Ac) antibody and anti-dimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) antibody. Positive immunoreactivity was evaluated using the Allred scoring system. Furthermore, the expression was confirmed by ChIP/WB assay using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections.\nThere was good correlation between immunostaining and expression on ChIP/WB assay (p \u003d 0.0005). There was a significant difference between the Allred score of H3K4 and the depth of tumor invasion (p \u003d 0.0003) and the pathological stages (p \u003d 0.0065). In overall survival classified by Allred scores of H3Ac (p \u003d 0.0072) and H3K4 (p \u003d 0.0187), the highest scores represented significantly worse prognoses than the other scores. Specifically, in stages II and III, the highest scores represented significantly worse prognoses than the other scores (p \u003c 0.0001 and p \u003d 0.0173, respectively).\nThe expression of H3Ac and H3K4 may estimate patient prognosis.","title":"Expression of acetylated and dimethylated histone H3 in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"23921187"}
