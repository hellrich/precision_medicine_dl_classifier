This chapter describes the currently known hereditary pancreatic cancer predisposition syndromes, including Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer and familial adenomatous polyposis. Strategies for genetic testing for hereditary pancreatic cancer and the appropriate options for surveillance and cancer risk reduction are discussed. Finally, ongoing research and future directions in the diagnosis and management of hereditary pancreatic cancer will be considered.
