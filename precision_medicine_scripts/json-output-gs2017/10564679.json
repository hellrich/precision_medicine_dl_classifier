We examined the effect of hospital prostatectomy volume and changes in the hospital volume on patient outcomes and the length of a patient\u0027s stay.\nWe collected data on 101 604 prostatectomies from Medicare claims filed from 1991 through 1994. By use of logistic regression and analysis of variance, we examined relationships between hospital load of prostatectomies, length of a patient\u0027s hospital stay, surgical complications, readmission rate, and mortality rate in a 30-day period following surgery. Statistical tests were two-sided.\nCross-sectional analyses revealed that, compared with high-volume hospitals, low-volume, medium-low-volume, and medium-high-volume hospitals had higher relative risks of readmission by 30% (95% confidence interval [CI] \u003d 21%-39%), 16% (95% CI \u003d 7%-25%), and 8% (95% CI \u003d -1% to 17%), respectively; higher relative risks of serious complications by 43% (95% CI \u003d 37%-48%), 25% (95% CI \u003d 19%-31%), and 9% (95% CI \u003d 3%-15%), respectively; and higher relative risks of mortality by 51% (95% CI \u003d 25%-77%), 43% (95% CI \u003d 17%-69%), and 42% (95% CI \u003d 16%-68%), respectively. The mean length of a patient\u0027s stay in a low-volume hospital was 9% longer than that in a high-volume hospital (8.51 days [95% CI \u003d 8.47-8.56] versus 7.81 days [95% CI \u003d 7.77-7.85]; P for trend across all volume categories \u003d.0001). Within-hospital longitudinal analyses revealed that hospitals with a relative increase in prostatectomy volume had a 57% greater reduction in the length of a patient\u0027s stay compared with those with a relative decrease in volume (P \u003d.005). Changes in prostatectomy volume did not affect the frequency of complications, mortality, and readmission. These findings suggest that an increase in a given hospital\u0027s prostatectomy volume may facilitate a decrease in the length of a patient\u0027s stay without an adverse impact on patient outcomes.","title":"Population-based study of relationships between hospital volume of prostatectomies, patient outcomes, and length of hospital stay.","pubmedId":"10564679"}
