Mutation of codon 12 of K-ras gene relating to cell growth signaling was reported as high as 90%, and p16/CDKN2 gene regulating cell cycle are frequently altered by point mutation, homozygous deletion, or methylation in pancreatic carcinoma. Mutations of K-ras and p16 gene in endocrine pancreatic carcinomas were reported 15-58% in insulinomas or gastrinomas. The alterations of K-ras and p16 gene was detected early event of carcinogenesis, to detect of the alteration with high sensitivity in pancreatic juice and serum, therefore, these alterations are very important for the early diagnosis of endocrine pancreatic carcinomas.","title":"[Alteration of the K-ras and p16/CDKN2 gene in endocrine pancreatic carcinomas].","pubmedId":"15148814"}
