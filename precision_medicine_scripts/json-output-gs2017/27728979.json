Clinical and laboratory data suggest that patient selection based on specific RAS mutations will be an essential component of these strategies. A thorough understanding of the biochemical and structural properties of mutant RAS proteins form the theoretical basis for these approaches. Direct inhibition of KRAS G12C by covalent inhibitors is a notable recent example of the RAS mutation-tailored approach that establishes a paradigm for other RAS mutation-centered strategies.","title":"Rationale for RAS mutation-tailored therapies.","pubmedId":"27728979"}
