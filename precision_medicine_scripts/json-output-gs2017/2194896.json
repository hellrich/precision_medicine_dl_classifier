In contrast to sporadic colon carcinomas, where 52% (11 of 21) contained mutations in codon 12, only 1 of 28 samples of ulcerative colitis associated carcinoma or dysplasia contained a c-Ki-ras mutation, despite the presence of aneuploid cell populations. These results suggest that a different genetic pathway for tumor progression may exist between sporadic colon carcinoma and carcinomas arising in chronic ulcerative colitis.","title":"c-Ki-ras mutations in chronic ulcerative colitis and sporadic colon carcinoma.","pubmedId":"2194896"}
