There are limited data on the immunohistochemical and molecular features of these tumors. Three cases of papillary carcinoma arising in struma ovarii (PCSO) were identified. The clinicopathological features were reviewed and immunohistochemical staining for HBME-1, cytokeratin (CK) 19, and CD56 was performed. Tumor DNA was sequenced for somatic mutations using a panel of 26 oncogenes, with a particular focus on BRAF and KRAS mutations. The patients were aged 22, 48, and 55 years. All cases were FIGO stage IA. Two tumors were of classical histological type, and one was a follicular variant papillary carcinoma. All tumors expressed HBME-1 and two were positive for CK19. CD56 was negative in all three cases. One tumor demonstrated a BRAF G469A mutation in exon 11, and in a second case, a KRAS Q61K double base mutation in exon 3 was detected. These mutations have not been described previously in PCSO. No mutations were detected in the benign follicular components of the tumors adjacent to the malignant papillary tissue. None of the patients had tumor recurrence on clinical follow-up (range 11 months to 8½ years). HBME-1, CK19, and CD56 are useful immunohistochemical markers of PCSO. Novel BRAF and KRAS mutations were identified in two of three tumors suggesting that mutations in PCSO may differ from those commonly identified in papillary carcinoma of the eutopic thyroid. The clinical significance of these mutations is uncertain but follow-up data in this small series support the generally good prognosis of PCSO.","title":"Novel BRAF and KRAS Mutations in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Arising in Struma Ovarii.","pubmedId":"26362194"}
