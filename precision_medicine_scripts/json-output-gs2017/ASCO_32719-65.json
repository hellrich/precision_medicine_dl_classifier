{"publicationTypes":["2009 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: To evaluate survival time and its prognostic factors contributing to survival of advanced unresected cholangiocarcinoma. Methods: We reviewed the experience of 330 patients with histologically proven unresected advanced intrahepatic and hilar cholangiocarcinoma and evaluated their survival time and significant prognostic factors. They did not receive any surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy and they underwent only palliative nonsurgical biliary drainage if it was needed to relieve biliary obstructive symptom. Results: Survival time of overall cholangiocarcinoma (medianSD) was 3.97.8 months; 35.3 months for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 5.910.1 months for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. By Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients survived significantly shorter than hilar cholangiocarcinoma patients. By multivariate analysis for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, distant metastasis was independently associated with shorter survival time. Multivariate analysis for hilar cholangiocarcinoma showed initial CEA \u003e 30 ng/dl were independent predictors of shorter survival. Conclusions: Patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma who do not undergo surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy have a dismal prognosis. We hope that the outcome of our study would help clinicians better predict the prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma patients not receiving such aggressive treatments. These data would be used as the comparable data for control groups of future studies to assess the outcome of newly designed or developed treatment method.","title":"Survival time and its prognostic factors in advanced unresected cholangiocarcinoma without chemoradiation.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32719-65"}
