EGFR gene mutation rate was 58.5%(24/41) in lung adenocarcinoma associated with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma differentiation, which was significantly higher than that of ordinary adenocarcinoma (37.9%, 33/87), squamous cell carcinoma (7.5%, 4/53), large cell carcinoma (1/5) and adenosquamous carcinoma (2/6, P\u003c0.05). EGFR gene mutation rates in male patients (20.9%, 24/115), were significantly higher than in the females (51.9%, 40/77; P\u003c0.01); non-smokers (50.0%, 57/114), significantly higher than that of smokers (9.0%, 7/78; P\u003c0.01).\nDNA direct sequencing method by PCR amplification is stable and reliable in detection of EGFR gene mutation in non-small cell lung cancer. It might provide a scientific basis for targeted therapy.","title":"[Detection of epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations and its clinical significance in non-small cell lung cancers].","pubmedId":"22321545"}
