Analysis of samples from 24 patients revealed methylation, deletions, and amplifications in 137 of 181 NotI clones. For 27 genes/loci, these changes occurred in more than 30% of the tumor samples, suggesting that these genes are involved in the development of colorectal cancer. An analysis of the methylation status of CpG island of the ITGA9 gene/loci by bisulfite sequencing confirmed the NotI microarray data on the gene/loci methylation in colorectal cancer. Aberrations in 19 genes/loci were unknown previously. Their characterization may help ascertain the mechanisms responsible for colorectal cancer development and identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers.","title":"Screening of epigenetic and genetic disturbances of human chromosome 3 genes in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"20387637"}
