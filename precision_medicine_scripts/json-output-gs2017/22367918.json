Quite frequently, the cytological interpretations of these specimens are indeterminate. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the diagnostic value of detecting K-ras (v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutation in pancreaticobiliary cytology specimens that had equivocal cytological diagnoses.\nA total of 129 cases that had indeterminate cytology diagnoses, K-ras mutational analysis, and histopathological follow-up were retrieved. The cytological interpretations, histopathological diagnoses, and K-ras mutation results were reviewed and analyzed.\nOverall, the sensitivity and specificity of K-ras mutation for detection of pancreaticobiliary malignancy including adenocarcinoma, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, and mucinous cystic neoplasm were 57% and 94%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of K-ras mutation for the presence of pancreaticobiliary malignancy were 94% and 60%, respectively.\nThe results demonstrate that K-ras mutation has a high predictive value for malignancy in patients with indeterminate pancreaticobiliary cytology and should be included as an important adjuvant diagnostic marker. It should be noted that a negative K-ras mutation result does not rule out malignancy, and K-ras mutation can be detected, although infrequently, in morphologically benign conditions.","title":"Diagnostic value of K-ras mutation analysis for pancreaticobiliary cytology specimens with indeterminate diagnosis.","pubmedId":"22367918"}
