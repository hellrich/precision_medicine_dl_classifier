We have performed immunocytochemical analysis of the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R or proto-oncogen c-erbB-1) and estrogen receptor (ER) in 70 cases of human breast carcinoma. We found an inverse relationship between the expression of EGF-R and ER (Kendall\u0027s tau b \u003d -0.1997, P \u003c 0.03), which prompts us to conclude that ER(-) breast carcinomas may grow in a hormone-independent manner through the over-expression of the proto-oncogene c-erbB-1, which is the receptor for epidermal (EGF) and alpha transforming (TGFalfa) growth factors.","title":"Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (proto-oncogene c-erbB-1) and estrogen receptor in human breast carcinoma.
