Tumor growth is assisted by various growth factors, and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are among the most important. A majority of the IGFs are bound to IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) and their release is dependent on the rate of IGFBP proteolysis. The action of free IGFs is exerted and controlled by binding to cell membrane receptors (IGF-Rs). The objective of this work was to connect two determinants of the CRC pathology: oxidation as a process that underlies tumor development and the members of the IGF system that control it. Carbonyl groups (CO) on IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IGF-1R, and IGF-2R were determined in samples obtained from patients with CRC, and IGF-binding properties of these proteins were analyzed. According to our results, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 in serum had increased content of CO groups due to CRC. Oxidation of IGFBP-2 increased its affinity for IGF molecules, whereas oxidation of IGFBP-3 reduced it. As for receptors, only intact CO-IGF-2R was detected on solubilized colon membranes, whereas CO-IGF-1R was degraded into fragments. Oxidative changes in the IGF axis may be regarded as part of the mechanism of its action. IGFs bound to IGFBP-3 remain in the circulation, whereas those bound to IGFBP-2 freely reach target tissues. Therefore, oxidation supports IGF distribution toward tissues and, consequently, promotes tumor growth.
