In Tunisia, its incidence has increased from 17.6 cases per 100.000 persons in 1997 to 27.6 cases per 100.000 persons in 2003. Its prognosis has been improving thanks to the emergence of molecular targets. The first one is represented by EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor), which marks this (2014) its tenth anniversary. many other targets have been identified. the most famous and useful of them the fusion gene ALK-EML4 but other oncogenic pathways have been implicated and under investigations including HER2, BRAF, MET, RET... The relevant challenges encountered are represented by the difficulty to achieve a consensual decisional and therapeutic algorithm, the absence of standardized diagnostic techniques and unavoidable occurrence of secondary resistance due to the activation of other oncogenic pathways that must be explored and targeted. In this update, we tried to present the major pathways implicated and the most relevant practice routine strategies.","title":"Genomic classification of lung cancer: toward a personalized treatment.","pubmedId":"26644092"}
