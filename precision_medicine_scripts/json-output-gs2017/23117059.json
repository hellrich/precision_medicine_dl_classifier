The incidence of 35.1 (95% confidence interval 21.4 to 54.2) per 100,000 woman years and 6.4 (6.1 to 6.8) per 100,000 woman years, respectively, led to an adjusted hazard ratio of 4.2 (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 6.5) for periods after completed follow-up compared with periods after normal primary smear test results. This hazard ratio was increased for all ages. No significant difference in risk of cervical cancer was observed by grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\nAn excess risk of cervical cancer previously observed for women treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was also observed in the subgroup of women who completed their post-treatment follow-up with three consecutive normal smear test results. The overall corrected risk of cervical cancer in these women was increased fourfold 35 cases per 100,000 woman years) compared with women with normal primary smear test results (6 per 100,000 woman years).","title":"Risk of cervical cancer after completed post-treatment follow-up of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: population based cohort study.","pubmedId":"23117059"}
