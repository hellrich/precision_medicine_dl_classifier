Molecular target therapy is one of the most popular and promising field of NSCLC treatment, and its hotspots includes EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), EML4-ALK (echinoderm microtubule associated protein like4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase), etc. Former researches indicated that EML4-ALK fusion and EGFR mutation were excluded mutually. However, cases of patients harbored concomitant EML4-ALK fusion gene and EGFR mutation have been reported continuously at recent. This review aims to summarize the incidence and molecular structure of EML4-ALK fusion gene and EGFR mutation, as well as clinical features of patients with the concomitant genes induced NSCLC.","title":"[Research progress in non-small cell lung cancer with concomitant EML4-ALK fusion gene and EGFR gene mutation].","pubmedId":"22104224"}
