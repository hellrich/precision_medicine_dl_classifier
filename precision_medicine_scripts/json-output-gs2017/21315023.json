The positive rate was 14.29%. Of the 4 positive lung cancer patients, one patient was in stage II, one in stage III, and the other two in stage IV. No p53 mutation was found in peripheral blood of 8 benign lung disease patients and 10 healthy persons.\nDetection of p53 gene mutation in peripheral blood cells may be helpful to the diagnosis of lung cancer, especially to the accurate staging of lung cancer.","title":"[Detection of p53 gene mutation in peripheral blood in the diagnosis of patients with lung cancer].","pubmedId":"21315023"}
