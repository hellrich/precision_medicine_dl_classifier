Senescent cells are capable of altering the inflammatory microenvironment through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which could have important consequences for tumorigenesis. The role of senescent cells in a highly inflammatory cancer like pancreatic cancer is still largely undefined, apart from the fact that senescence abrogation increases tumorigenesis in vivo. This review will summarize our current knowledge of the phenomenon of cellular senescence in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, its overlapping link with inflammation, and some urgent unanswered questions in the field.
