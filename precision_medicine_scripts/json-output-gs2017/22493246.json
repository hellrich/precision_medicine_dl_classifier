Here we find that transcriptional activation mediated by the Gli family of transcription factors, although dispensable for pancreatic development, is required for Kras-induced proliferation and survival in primary pancreatic epithelial cells in culture and for Kras-driven pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PDAC formation in vivo. Further, ectopic Gli1 activation in the mouse pancreas accelerates Kras-driven tumor formation, underscoring the importance of Gli transcription factors in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Interestingly, we demonstrate Gli-regulated I-kappa-B kinase epsilon (IKBKE) and NF-κB activity in pancreatic cancer cells and show that this activity is a critical downstream mediator for Gli-dependent PDAC cell transformation and survival. Together, these studies demonstrate the requirement for Gli in Kras-dependent pancreatic epithelial transformation, suggest a mechanism of Gli-NF-κB oncogenic activation, and provide genetic evidence supporting the therapeutic targeting of Gli activity in pancreatic cancer.","title":"The activity of Gli transcription factors is essential for Kras-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis.","pubmedId":"22493246"}
