Gemcitabine (Gemzar; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN), a new agent with good tolerability, interacts synergistically with platinum agents. Carboplatin is as effective as cisplatin, but is less toxic. The London Lung Cancer Group is conducting a multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase III trial in patients with histologically or cytologically proven small cell lung cancer and extensive-stage, limited-stage but locally-advanced, or limited-stage disease with poor prognostic factors. Chemotherapy consists of 21-day cycles of gemcitabine 1,200 mg/m(2) intravenous (IV) on days 1 and 8, plus carboplatin area under the curve of 5 IV on day 1, or cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) IV on day 1 plus etoposide 120 mg/m(2) IV on day 1 and 100 mg orally on days 2 and 3. Thirty-nine patients have been randomized to gemcitabine/carboplatin and 38 to cisplatin/etoposide (23 and 22 completed treatment, with 96 and 84 cycles, respectively). Preliminary toxicity data indicate hematologic toxicity in 25% of cycles for gemcitabine/carboplatin and 16% for cisplatin/etoposide, although cisplatin/etoposide-treated patients experienced significant alopecia, nephrotoxicity, nausea and vomiting, and neutropenia. This London Lung Cancer Group trial of gemcitabine/carboplatin may define an active, safe, and acceptable treatment for patients with extensive-stage and poor-prognosis small cell lung cancer.
