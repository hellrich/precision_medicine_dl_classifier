We aimed to quantify the risk of mental disorders in offspring and determine whether increased risk extends beyond the disorder present in the parent.\nMeta-analyses of absolute and relative rates of mental disorders in offspring of parents with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression in family high-risk studies published by December 2012.\nWe included 33 studies with 3863 offspring of parents with SMI and 3158 control offspring. Offspring of parents with SMI had a 32% probability of developing SMI (95% CI: 24%-42%) by adulthood (age \u003e20). This risk was more than twice that of control offspring (risk ratio [RR] 2.52; 95% CI 2.08-3.06, P \u003c .001). High-risk offspring had a significantly increased rate of the disorder present in the parent (RR \u003d 3.59; 95% CI: 2.57-5.02, P \u003c .001) and of other types of SMI (RR \u003d 1.92; 95% CI: 1.48-2.49, P \u003c .001). The risk of mood disorders was significantly increased among offspring of parents with schizophrenia (RR \u003d 1.62; 95% CI: 1.02-2.58; P \u003d .042). The risk of schizophrenia was significantly increased in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (RR \u003d 6.42; 95% CI: 2.20-18.78, P \u003c .001) but not among offspring of parents with depression (RR \u003d 1.71; 95% CI: 0.19-15.16, P \u003d .631).\nOffspring of parents with SMI are at increased risk for a range of psychiatric disorders and one third of them may develop a SMI by early adulthood.","title":"Risk of mental illness in offspring of parents with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of family high-risk studies.","pubmedId":"23960245"}
