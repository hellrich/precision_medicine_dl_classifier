Patients who scored 9 or above on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were administered to the standardized computer-assisted Composite International Diagnostic Interview for mental disorders adapted for cancer patients (CIDI-O). A random sample of those with a PHQ-9 score that was less than 9 were selected for a CIDI-O.\nA total of 5,889 patients were identified, which led to 4,020 participants (a 68.3% response rate); of those, 2,141 patients were interviewed. The 4-week total prevalence for any mental disorder was 31.8% (95% CI, 29.8% to 33.8%); this included any anxiety disorder (11.5%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 12.9%), any adjustment disorder (11.1%; 95% CI, 9.7% to 12.4%), any mood disorder (6.5%; 95% CI, 5.5% to 7.5%), any somatoform/conversion disorder (5.3%; 95% CI, 4.3% to 6.2%), nicotine dependence (4.5%; 95% CI, 3.6% to 5.4%), alcohol abuse/dependence (0.3%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 0.6%), any mental disorder resulting from general medical condition (2.3%; 95% CI, 1.7% to 2.9%), and any eating disorder (0%). The highest prevalence for any mental disorder was found in patients with breast cancer (41.6%; 95% CI, 36.8% to 46.4%), followed by patients with head and neck cancer (40.8%; 95% CI, 28.5% to 53.0%). The lowest prevalence was found in patients with pancreatic cancer (20.3%; 95% CI, 8.9% to 31.6%) and stomach/esophagus cancers (21.2%; 95% CI, 12.8% to 29.6%).\nOur findings provide evidence for the strong need for psycho-oncological interventions.","title":"Four-week prevalence of mental disorders in patients with cancer across major tumor entities.","pubmedId":"25287821"}
