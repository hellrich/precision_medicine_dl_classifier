Surprisingly, little is known about the role and regulation of hdm2 in pancreatic tumors, a large proportion (50-75%) of which contain mutant p53. In this study, we determined that hdm2 was expressed in a Ras-signaling-dependent manner in various pancreatic cancer cell lines. As p53 was mutated and inactive in these cells, the expression of hdm2 was seemingly redundant. Indeed, the proliferation and survival of cell lines such as Panc-1 and Panc-28 could be inhibited by PRIMA-1 (mutant p53 activator) but not by Nutlin-3 (inhibitor of the hdm2-p53 interaction). Unexpectedly, however, the proliferation of both cell lines was strongly inhibited by hdm2-specific RNAi. Our data also revealed cyclin D1, c-Jun and c-Myc to be novel targets of hdm2 and suggested that they might mediate hdm2\u0027s role in cellular proliferation and/or survival. We conclude from our results that hdm2 is expressed in pancreatic cancer cells as a result of activated Ras signaling, and that it regulates cellular proliferation and the expression of three novel target genes by p53-independent mechanisms.","title":"Hdm2 is regulated by K-Ras and mediates p53-independent functions in pancreatic cancer cells.","pubmedId":"19029954"}
