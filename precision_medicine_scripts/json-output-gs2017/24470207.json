To better characterize the genetic alterations involved in colorectal carcinogenesis related to villous adenoma, we analyzed mutations in APC, BRAF, KRAS, TP53, and GNAS in 12 colorectal adenocarcinomas associated with villous adenomas. APC, KRAS, and BRAF mutations were identified in five, 11, and one lesion, respectively, and most of these mutations were shared between the villous adenoma and the adenocarcinoma components in the respective lesions, except in one lesion with APC mutations and in two lesions with KRAS mutations. TP53 mutations were observed exclusively in four adenocarcinoma components, consistent with their role in the progression from adenoma to adenocarcinoma. Activating GNAS mutations were found in nine villous adenomas; however, unexpectedly, these mutations were shared only in three associated adenocarcinomas. Notably, all six adenocarcinomas with discordant GNAS mutation statuses were nonmucinous type, whereas all the other adenocarcinomas, including three adenocarcinomas associated with GNAS wild-type villous adenomas, were mucinous type. The current study suggests that GNAS-mutated villous adenomas may not necessarily be direct precursors of associated adenocarcinomas. At the same time, our observations support the role of activating GNAS mutations in increased mucin production in colorectal neoplasms.","title":"Frequent lack of GNAS mutations in colorectal adenocarcinoma associated with GNAS-mutated villous adenoma.","pubmedId":"24470207"}
