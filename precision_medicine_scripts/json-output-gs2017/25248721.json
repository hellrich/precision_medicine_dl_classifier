To understand the mechanisms of oscillations in the KRAS status we evaluated the collective of CRC patients tested using allele-specific PCR and Sanger-sequencing. Mutant KRAS allele was observed in 43.3% of cases. Repeated analysis of KRAS status in recurrent tumors or metastases was performed in 18/665 cases and a total of 6 cases with different KRAS status was found. In three cases the histological pattern of the tumor was identical. In one patient different histology and molecular status was seen between the primary and the recurrent tumor samples. In two further cases localization, histological type and KRAS mutational status all supported the occurrence of synchron/metachron colorectal tumors. In conclusion, both the progression of the original disease but also multiple tumor formation may contribute to mutation status differences during the course of colorectal carcinoma.","title":"Changes of KRAS Exon 2 Codon 12/13 Mutation Status in Recurrent Colorectal Cancer.","pubmedId":"25248721"}
