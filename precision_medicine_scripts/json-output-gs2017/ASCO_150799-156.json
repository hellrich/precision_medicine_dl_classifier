The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between serum EGFR mutation status and clinical efficacy of afatinib in NSCLC harboring active EGFR mutations and previously treated with gefitinib or erlotinib.  Methods:    Serum samples were collercted before afatinib treatment from patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR active mutations and treated gefitinib or erlotinib. DNA was extracted from 2ml of the serum and EGFR mutation status was examined by using cobas EGFR Mutation Test. Assessment of response and resistance to afatinib was studied in the patients.   Results:    Between May 2014 and Dec 2014, total of 22 serum samples were collected from 22 patients who were previously treated with gefitinib (n \u003d 17) or erlotinib (n \u003d 13) and progressed. EGFR mutations in the serum were detected in 5 of 22 patients (22.7%, CI 7.8-45.4%), Exon19 deletion was detected in 4/9, Exon21 L858R in 1/12, and Exon21 L861Q in 0/1. T790M was detected in 3 patients (combined with Exon19 deletion in 2 patients, with L858R in 1). Although overall response rate (ORR) was similar in serum EGFR wild type patients compared to serum EGFR mutated patients (17.6% and 20.0%), disease control rate (DCR) in serum EGFR mutated patients  was higher than in the wild type (80.0% vs 47.0%). On the other hand, patients who harboring T790M did not response to afatinib treatment.   Conclusions:    Serum EGFR mutation analysis may be useful to predict the efficacy of afatinib in patients who were previously treated with gefitinib or erlotinib. Usefulness of plasma EGFR typing by using more sensitive and quantitative PCR such as digital droplet PCR is under examination.","title":"EGFR mutation status of cell free serum DNA and clinical efficacy of afatinib in pretreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150799-156"}
