Tumors were evaluated according to size, localization, tumor border, and structure as well as tumor composition. These imaging criteria were correlated with histopathological findings.\nNineteen myxoid liposarcomas were histologically classified as low-grade myxoid liposarcomas, whereas 11 were considered high-grade myxoid liposarcomas. Mean tumor volume of low-grade myxoid liposarcomas (710.1 ± 960.1 ccm) was significantly smaller as compared to high-grade myxoid liposarcomas (2737.0 ± 3423.7 ccm; P \u003d 0.04). In addition to necrotic areas, three tumor components - fatty, myxoid, as well as contrast-enhancing non-fatty, non-myxoid - could be identified. The mean fraction of fatty tumor areas in low-grade myxoid liposarcomas was 10 ± 11% as compared to 6 ± 4% for high-grade myxoid liposarcomas (P \u003d 0.66). Myxoid components accounted for 88 ± 16% in low-grade myxoid liposarcomas, but only for 45 ± 25% in high-grade myxoid liposarcomas (P \u003c 0.0001). The non-fatty, non-myxoid tumor fraction was significantly higher in high-grade myxoid liposarcomas (50 ± 25%) as compared to low-grade myxoid liposarcomas (2 ± 9%; P \u003c 0.0001). A proportion of \u003e 5% of this tumor fraction was found to be a precise unique predictor for high-grade myxoid liposarcomas with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 95%.\nTumor components with contrast-enhancing non-fatty, non-myxoid imaging features were predominantly found in high-grade myxoid liposarcomas, which may histologically resemble round cell clusters.","title":"Differentiation of myxoid liposarcoma by magnetic resonance imaging: a histopathologic correlation.","pubmedId":"24123962"}
