Since c-kit mutation occurs only in one-third of GIST, there might be other molecular mechanisms. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH), microsatellite instability (MSI) and NF2 gene mutation were investigated in 22 GISTs (9 low-risk and 13 high-risk tumors). LOH and MSI were evaluated using 41 markers on 21 chromosomal arms, and NF2 gene mutation was examined by PCR-SSCP. High frequency of LOH was observed on 14q (9 / 19, 47%), and 22q (17 / 22, 77%). The frequencies were similar in low-risk and high-risk tumors, and were unrelated with gastric or intestinal origin. Two other abnormalities, additional LOH on other chromosomes and MSI at more than two loci, were characteristic of the high-risk tumors (P \u003c 0.05). NF2 gene mutation was identified in two cases showing 22q-LOH (8 bp deletion on the splice donor site of exon 7, and 1 bp insertion at position 432 of exon 4, which resulted in nonsense mutation). There was no significant correlation between these results and c-kit gene mutation, which was observed in 8 of 22 tumors. Suppressor genes on 14q and 22q may be involved, independently of c-kit gene mutation, in the development of GIST. NF2 contributes as a tumor suppressor in a small subset of GIST. These abnormalities are presumably followed by increased genetic instability.","title":"Allelic loss of 14q and 22q, NF2 mutation, and genetic instability occur independently of c-kit mutation in gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","pubmedId":"11123422"}
