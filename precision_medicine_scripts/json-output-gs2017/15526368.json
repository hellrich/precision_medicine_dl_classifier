DNA ploidy was determined by flow cytometry.\nOf the 55 cases of GISTs, 53 cases (96.4%) expressed c-Kit protein. The c-Kit gene mutations of exons 11 and 9 were found in 30 (54.5%) and 7 cases (12.7%), respectively. No mutations were found in exons 13 and 17. DNA aneuploidy was seen in 10 cases (18.2%). The c-Kit mutation positive GISTs were larger in size than the negative GISTs. The aneuploidy tumors were statistically associated with large size, high mitotic counts, high risk groups, high cellularity and severe nuclear atypia, and epithelioid type. There was a tendency that c-Kit mutations were more frequently found in aneuploidy GISTs.\nDNA aneuploidy and c-Kit mutations can be considered as prognostic factors in GISTs.","title":"DNA ploidy and c-Kit mutation in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"15526368"}
