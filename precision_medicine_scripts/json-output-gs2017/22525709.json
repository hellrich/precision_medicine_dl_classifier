Yet, most of these patients succumb to the disease. Approximately 60% of patients with GIST are cured by surgery, and these individuals can be identified by risk stratification schemes based on tumour size, mitosis count and site, and assessment of rupture. Two large randomized trials have evaluated imatinib as adjuvant treatment for operable, KIT-positive GIST; adjuvant imatinib substantially improved time to recurrence. One of these trials reported that 3 years of adjuvant imatinib improves overall survival of patients who have a high estimated risk for recurrence of GIST compared with 1 year of imatinib. The optimal adjuvant strategy remains unknown and some patients might benefit from longer than 3 years of imatinib treatment. However, a strategy that involves GIST risk assessment following surgery using a validated scheme, administration of adjuvant imatinib for 3 years, patient monitoring during and after completion of imatinib to detect recurrence early, and reinstitution of imatinib if GIST recurs is a reasonable choice for care of patients with high-risk GIST.","title":"Adjuvant treatment of GIST: patient selection and treatment strategies.","pubmedId":"22525709"}
