The expressions of CA IX in 58 cases of pancreatic cancer and paired paracancerous normal tissues, obtained from 2005 to 2012 in the first Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, were detected, as well as its expressions in different pancreatic cancer cell lines, aiming to detect the impacts of CA IX silencing towards the invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. The CA IX expressions in 58 pancreatic cancer cases were higher than those in the paired paracancerous normal tissues (P \u003c 0.01), and positively correlated with the tumor size and the UICC staging UICC (P \u003c 0.05), the multivariate analysis showed that the high expression of CA IX was the independent risk factor towards the prognosis of pancreatic cancer (P \u003c 0.05). The CA IX was highly expressed in AxPC-1 and Miapaca-2, and the interference effects were significant. CA IX silencing could significantly inhibit the invasion and metastasis of AxPC-1 and Miapaca. We support a pro-tumor role of CA IX in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Roles of Carbonic Anhydrase IX in Development of Pancreatic Cancer.","pubmedId":"26224207"}
