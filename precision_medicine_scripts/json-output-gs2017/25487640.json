Germline point mutations in the serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) have been identified in about 70% of patients with PJS. Only a few large genomic deletions have been identified. We report on a girl with PJS and multiple congenital anomalies. She had intellectual disability, umbilical hernia, bilateral inguinal hernias, scoliosis, and distinct facial appearance including prominent mandible, smooth philtrum, and malformed ears. She developed lip pigmentation at the age of 12 years but had no gastrointestinal polyps. Array comparative genomic hybridization revealed an approximately 610â€‰kb deletion at 19p13.3, encompassing STK11. Together with previous reports, the identification of common clinical features suggests that microdeletion at 19p13.3 encompassing STK11 constitutes a distinctive phenotype.","title":"Microdeletion of 19p13.3 in a girl with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and distinctive features.","pubmedId":"25487640"}
