Androgen receptor (AR) signaling may exert therapeutic effects on the DNA repair pathway in PC. We have assessed the proteomic/genomic DNA repair aberrations in primary (P) and metastatic (M) PC and explored the therapeutic implications of these mutations using panomic next generation sequencing (NGS). We hypothesized that there is a differential in gene expression and mutation between P and M tumors. Methods: Molecular profiles of 437 PC tumor samples were defined. Protein expression (IHC), gene amplification (ISH) and sequencing (NGS) were performed. A panel of 30 DNA repair genes was used to define DNA repair intact (DRI) and DNA repair deficient (DRD) subgroups. Unclassified variants were included for analysis. Pearsons chi-squared test was used to test for significant differences. Results: Biopsies from 437 PCs (median age 67) were studied. Specimens submitted for profiling included 158 P PCs (36%) and 279 M PCs (64% [18% bone; 37% visceral; 24% lymph nodes; 21% other sites]). The most frequently mutated DNA repair genes included TP53 (31%), ERCC5 (19%), FANCG (16%), MSH6 (13%), PMS1 (13%), POLE (10%) PTEN (9%) and BRCA2 (6%). Functional protein loss as measured by IHC was seen in ERCC1 (44%), MGMT (39%), and PTEN (43%). In a limited cohort of patients tested using a 592-gene hybrid-capture NGS, 26/31 (84%) had alterations in at least 1 DNA repair gene. DRD PC exhibited higher expression rates of AR (57% vs. 20%; p \u003d .048) and TOPO1 (88% vs. 40%; p \u003d .02) than DRI PC. An optimal taxane therapeutic response profile was observed in 20% of DRD tumors. Significant differences between P and M tumors were seen in ERCC1, AR, ATM and TP53. M tumors had significantly increased expression of TOP2A, TS and TUBB3. Conclusions: DNA repair defects are common in PC with a difference in gene expression and mutation between P and M tumors. Differential expression between African American and Caucasian patients and further classification of variants are currently being assessed. Taxane-platinum combination chemotherapy should be tested specifically in DRD PC.","title":"Use of panomic assessment to reveal DNA repair alterations and to predict potential therapeutic response to taxane-platinum combination therapy in prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_169293-176"}
