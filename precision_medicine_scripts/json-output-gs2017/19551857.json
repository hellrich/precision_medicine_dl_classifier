We investigated the biological, therapeutic and clinical features associated with MSI in immunodeficiency-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas (ID-RL). MSI screening was performed in 275 ID-RL. MSI ID-RL were further analyzed for MMR gene expression and for BRAF/KRAS mutations since these genes are frequently altered in MSI cancers. We also assessed the expression of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), an enzyme whose inactivation has been reported in lymphomas and may help in the selection of MMR deficient clones. Unlike other sporadic MSI neoplasms, MSI ID-RL (N \u003d 17) presented with heterogeneous MMR defects and no MLH1 promoter methylation. About one third of these tumors presented with normal expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. They accumulated BRAF activating mutations (33%). Unlike other ID-RL, MSI ID-RL were primarily EBV-negative NHL of T-cell origin, and arose after long-term immunosuppression in patients who received azathioprine as part of their immunosuppressive regimen (p \u003d 0.05) and/or who exhibited methylation-induced loss of expression of MGMT in tumor cells (p\u003d 0.02). Overall, these results highlight that, in the context of deficient immune status, some MSI neoplasms arise through alternative mechanism when compared to other sporadic MSI neoplasms. They give the exact way how to make the diagnosis of MSI in these tumors and may help to define biological and clinicalrisk factors associated with their emergence in such a clinicalcontext.","title":"The mechanisms underlying MMR deficiency in immunodeficiency-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas are different from those in other sporadic microsatellite instable neoplasms.","pubmedId":"19551857"}
