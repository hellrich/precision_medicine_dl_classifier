An informal meta-analysis of 13 randomized trials of these regimens in NSCLC indicates no marked differences in terms of response rates or survival, but toxicity advantages with cisplatin/gemcitabine and cisplatin/vinorelbine regimens. An informal meta-analysis to assess the feasibility of substituting carboplatin for cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine or docetaxel shows no marked differences in efficacy between cisplatin- and carboplatin-containing regimens, although a slight trend favoring carboplatin/gemcitabine treatment may be observed; comparison of toxicity profiles among carboplatin-based regimens suggests advantages for carboplatin/gemcitabine treatment. A formal meta-analysis of 13 trials comparing gemcitabine/platinum combinations with other platinum-based regimens in NSCLC indicates significant improvements in progression-free survival and overall survival with gemcitabine/platinum treatment. On balance, available data suggest that carboplatin/gemcitabine may be the first-line option with the best therapeutic index.","title":"Gemcitabine-containing regimens vs others in first-line treatment of NSCLC.","pubmedId":"15339056"}
