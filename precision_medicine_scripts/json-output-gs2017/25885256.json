Cerebrovascular events are not recognized as expected adverse effects of such therapy.\nWe report the case of a 67-year-old, current-smoking male with stage-IV HER2-positive gastric cancer who suffered right middle cerebral artery (MCA) embolism after trastuzumab + chemotherapy. He received trastuzumab and cisplatin on Day 1, followed by a continuous 5-fluorouracil infusion for 5 days as a first-line treatment. Four days after chemotherapy initiation, he presented with left hemiplegia, and brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography revealed a right MCA occlusion. No further chemotherapy was administered because of worsening performance status.\nThe present case, possibly the first such reported case, suggests the risk of development of embolism after trastuzumab + chemotherapy in HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer, although other factors should be considered.","title":"A case of severe cerebral embolism after chemotherapy for HER2-positive gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"25885256"}
