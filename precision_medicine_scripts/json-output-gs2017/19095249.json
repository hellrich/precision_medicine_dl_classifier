Androgen receptor exerts its effect through downstream target genes to regulate prostate cancer cell proliferation. The c-FLIP gene was recently shown to be an androgen receptor target gene. c-FLIP is an inactive homologue of caspase-8 and, thus, it inhibits the death receptor mediated apoptosis pathway. c-FLIP over expression was shown to accelerate the progression of prostate cancer cells to androgen independence. We evaluated the role of c-FLIP expression in stromal cells in prostate cancer development.\nWe examined c-FLIP expression in 53 androgen dependent and 21 androgen independent prostate cancer stromal cells by immunohistochemical analysis. The effects of c-FLIP over expression in stromal cells on the growth and invasion of LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells were determined in indirect coculture systems.\nAt the androgen dependent stage the stromal c-FLIP level was increased in prostate cancer tissue. The expression level of stromal c-FLIP was associated with tumor differentiation. However, stromal c-FLIP expression was not increased in androgen independent human prostate cancer. c-FLIP over expression in stromal cells stimulated the growth and invasion of prostate cancer, including LNCaP and PC3 cells in vitro.\nThese results indicate the over expression of stromal c-FLIP and its function for promoting prostate cancer growth and invasion.","title":"Stromal anti-apoptotic androgen receptor target gene c-FLIP in prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"19095249"}
