The use of reliable techniques for its detection is important. The aim of our study was to compare the performance characteristics in V600E detection of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and high-resolution melting (HRM) with TaqMan allelic discrimination as well as direct-sequencing methods in a series of 195 colorectal paraffin-embedded specimens up to the age of 15 years. The effectiveness for obtaining results on mutation status was best using TaqMan (96.9%), followed by dHPLC (93.3%), HRM (88.7%), and sequencing (88.2%). In general, TaqMan was best for analyzing older tissues, whereas sequencing was the least efficient. Heterozygotic V600E was detected in 11.6%, 9.9%, 11.6%, and 9.9% of tissues using TaqMan, dHPLC, HRM, and sequencing, respectively. Result concordances between dHPLC and TaqMan or sequencing were excellent (κ \u003d 0.9411 and κ \u003d 0.8988, respectively); for HRM, the concordances were good (κ \u003d 0.7973 and κ \u003d 0.7488, respectively). By using DNA dilutions from tumor tissue, a minimum of 10% of V600E harboring cancer content was required for the analysis by dHPLC and HRM. dHPLC could detect four non-V600E mutations, whereas HRM detected one. Our results indicate that dHPLC and HRM are techniques that can be reliably used for the detection of the BRAFV600E mutation in archival paraffin-embedded tissues.","title":"Comparison of allelic discrimination by dHPLC, HRM, and TaqMan in the detection of BRAF mutation V600E.","pubmedId":"21708284"}
