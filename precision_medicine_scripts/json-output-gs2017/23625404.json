The recent development of multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) provides a useful tool for measuring the absolute quantity of phosphorylation occupancy at pivotal sites within signaling proteins, even when the phosphorylation sites are in close proximity. Here, we described a targeted quantitation approach to measure the absolute phosphorylation occupancy at Y1234 and Y1235 of Met. The approach is utilized to obtain absolute occupancy of the two phosphorylation sites in the full-length recombinant Met. It is further applied to quantitate the phosphorylation state of these two sites in SNU-5 cells treated with a Met inhibitor.","title":"Quantitation of Met tyrosine phosphorylation using MRM-MS.","pubmedId":"23625404"}
