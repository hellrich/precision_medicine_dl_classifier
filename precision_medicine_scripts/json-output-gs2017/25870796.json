BRAF mutations are commonly seen in melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinicopathological features of BRAF mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases submitted for routine mutation testing at our institution.\nMutation analysis for BRAF, EGFR and KRAS was performed using Sequenom MassARRAY platform with OncoCarta panel v1.0. Pathological features were reviewed and immunohistochemistry for BRAF V600E was also performed.\nSeven out of 273 cases (2.6%) had BRAF mutations (three males and four females, median age 70 years, all smokers), with six adenocarcinomas and one NSCLC, not otherwise specified (NOS). All had wild-type EGFR and KRAS. The identified BRAF mutations were V600E (4/7, 58%), K601N, L597Q and G469V. BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry was positive in two cases with V600E and negative in one case with K601N (tissue available in three cases only). No significant difference in age or gender was found (BRAF mutant vs. wild-type).\nBRAF mutations occur in a small proportion of NSCLC that lack other driver mutations. The clinicopathological profile differs from that of EGFR mutant tumours. The potential benefits of BRAF-inhibitors should be investigated.","title":"BRAF mutations in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25870796"}
