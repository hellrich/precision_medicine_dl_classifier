We screened 36 plasma-circulating DNA samples, 24 from the disease control group and 25 of a healthy group, to be subsequently sequenced to confirm mutations. Simultaneously, we tested the specimens using conventional PCR followed by HRM and then used target-DNA cloning and sequencing for verification. The ROC and respective AUC were calculated for KRAS mutations and/or serum CA 19-9.\nIt was found that the sensitivity of Sanger reached 0.5% with COLD- PCR, whereas that obtained after conventional PCR did 20%; that of COLD-PCR based on unlabeled-probe HRM, 0.1%. KRAS mutations were identified in 26 of 36 PA cases (72.2%), while none were detected in the disease control and/or healthy group. KRAS mutations were identified both in 26 PA tissues and plasma samples. The AUC of COLD-PCR based unlabeled probe HRM turned out to be 0.861, which when combined with CA 19-9 increased to 0.934.\nIt was concluded that COLD-PCR with unlabeled-probe HRM can be a sensitive and accurate screening technique to detect KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations in plasma-circulating DNA for diagnosing and treating PA.","title":"Co-amplification at lower denaturation-temperature PCR combined with unlabled-probe high-resolution melting to detect KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations in plasma-circulating DNA of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases.","pubmedId":"25605154"}
