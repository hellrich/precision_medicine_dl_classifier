Imatinib mesylate has been proven to be effective in advanced GIST. The current pilot study was designed to observe imatinib mesylate treatment for GIST patients who experienced sole liver metastasis after primary tumor resection.\nFrom June 2004 to July 2005, 21 patients who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled in this study. They were administered Glivec at an initial dose of 400 mg/day. The primary end points were grade 3-4 hematological or non-hematological toxicity and progression-free survival; the secondary end points were response rate and overall survival.\nEdema was the most common toxicity, whereas grade 3 and 4 side effects were rare. The overall response rate was 52.4%. Only 1 patient died in the course of the study; the 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 85.7 and 95.2%, respectively.\nImatinib mesylate treatment proved safe and effective for GIST patients who had liver metastasis alone. A prolonged survival was observed, and long-term follow-up is still continued.","title":"Imatinib mesylate treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor: a pilot study focusing on patients experiencing sole liver metastasis after a prior radical resection.","pubmedId":"18497504"}
