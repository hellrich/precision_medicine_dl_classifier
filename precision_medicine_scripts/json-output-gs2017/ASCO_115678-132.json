Several studies demonstrated that tumor cell dissemination may occur in gynecologic cancer and affect clinical outcome. The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of DTC and to assess their prognostic significance in patients with gynecologic malignancies.  Methods:  Bone marrow aspirates from 623 patients with primary endometrial (331), cervical (228), and vulvar cancer (64) undergoing surgery at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany between November 2001 and May 2012, were included into the study. Disseminated tumor cells were identified by immunocytochemistry using the pancytokeratin antibody A45B/B3 and by cytomorphology.  Results:  Disseminated tumor cells were detected in 18% of BM aspirates from patients with gynecological malignancies. Incidences of DTC in endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancer were 21%, 16% and 16%, respectively. The presence of DTC was associated with a lower tumor grade in endometrial cancer For patients with vulvar cancer, no correlation with established clinicopathological factors was observed. In case of cervical cancer, BM positivity was correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, nodal involvement and the presence of lymphangiosis carcinomatosa. For all analyzed tumor entities, no association between BM status and clinical outcome could be observed.  Conclusions:  Disseminated tumor cells are a common phenomenon in solid tumors. However, only in cervical cancer DTC postivity was associated with advanced disease. The consequences for DTC positive patients have to be determined.","title":"Disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow of patients with endometrial and cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_115678-132"}
