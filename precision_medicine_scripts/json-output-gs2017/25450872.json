Genotyping for KRAS mutations was performed in 10 patients. Outcomes were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method/Cox regression, or cumulative incidence method/Fine-Gray analysis.\nThe median patient age was 74 (range, 46 to 93) years, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 to 1 in 63%. Tumor histology included adenocarcinoma (44%), squamous cell carcinoma (25%), and NSCLC (18%). Most tumors were T1a (54%). Seven patients had KRAS-mutant tumors (9%). With a median follow-up of 18.8 months among survivors, the 1-year estimate of overall survival was 88%, cancer-specific survival (CSS) 92%, primary tumor control 94%, and freedom from recurrence (FFR) 67%. In patients with KRAS-mutant tumors, there was a significantly lower tumor control (67% vs. 96%; P \u003d .04), FFR (48% vs. 69%; P \u003d .03), and CSS (75% vs. 93%; P \u003d .05). On multivariable analysis, histology was not associated with outcomes, but KRAS mutation (hazard ratio, 10.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-45.6; P \u003d .0022) was associated with decreased CSS after adjusting for age.\nIn this SBRT series, histology was not associated with outcomes, but KRAS mutation was associated with lower FFR on univariable analysis and decreased CSS on multivariable analysis. Because of the small sample size, these hypothesis-generating results need to be studied in larger data sets.","title":"Outcomes by tumor histology and KRAS mutation status after lung stereotactic body radiation therapy for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25450872"}
