Chest computed tomography revealed an ill-defined mass in the lower lobe of the left lung and multiple sized nodular shadows in the both lungs.  An endobronchial polypoid tumor in the left B8 bronchus was found by bronchoscopic examination.  A biopsy specimen obtained from the tumor diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma.  Although very rare, we should therefore keep in mind that patients who have a pulmonary tumor adjacent to the bronchus with an endobronchial polypoid lesion may have lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Lung adenocarcinoma with endobronchial growth.","pubmedId":"22233312"}
