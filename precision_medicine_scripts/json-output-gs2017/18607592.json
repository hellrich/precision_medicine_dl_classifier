The majority of uterine sarcomas are leiomyosarcoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS). Surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy are used for the treatment of ESS. Imatinib mesylate is indicated in the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumor and chronic myelogeneus leukemia. There is an interest to use imatinib mesylate in the treatment of c-kit positive ESS. We reported a case of 42-year-old female low-grade ESS progressed on chemotherapy and presented with objective response to imatinib mesylate. The treatment response was evaluated with FDG PET/CT. Complete metabolic response was detected. FDG PET, a sensitive method for tumor response evaluation on the basis of tumor metabolism changes, is useful for the evaluation of imatinib treatment in low-grade ESS.","title":"Detection of complete response to imatinib mesylate (Glivec/Gleevec) with 18F-FDG PET/CT for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma.","pubmedId":"18607592"}
