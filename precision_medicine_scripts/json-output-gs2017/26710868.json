And then the correlations were analyzed between EMIA-ALK fusion gene and EGFR gene with clinical features and the clinical efficacies of targeted therapy.\nThe mutation rate of EGFR gene was 35% (14/40) and 50% (10/20) in non-smokers and 46.7% (14/30) in adenocarcinoma patients. The mutation distribution was as follows: exon 18 (n \u003d 1), exon 19 (n \u003d8) and exon 21 (n \u003d5). The mutation rate of EML4-ALK fusion gene was 2. 5% (1/40). EGFR gene mutation was predominantly present in non-smokers (P \u003c 0. 05) and adenocarcinoma (P \u003c0. 01) while no significant difference existed between gender, age or stage (P \u003e0. 05). Those on a targeted therapy had a disease control rate of 93. 3%.\nBoth EGFR gene and EMI4-ALK fusion gene may be detected in superficial lymph nodes of NSCLC patients. The mutation rate of EGFR gene is high in adenocarcinoma and non-smokers while EML4-ALK fusion gene has a low mutation rate.","title":"[Mutations of EGFR gene and EML4-ALK fusion gene in superficial lymph node of non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"26710868"}
