The series included 11 never-smokers, 86 former smokers, 152 current smokers and one patient without informed smoking status. There were 110 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 133 adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and seven large cell carcinomas or mixed histologies. Expression of p53 was analysed by immunohistochemistry. DNA was extracted from frozen tumour tissues. TP53 mutations were detected in 48.8% of cases and were more frequent among SCCs than ADCs (p\u003c0.0001). TP53 mutation status was not associated with prognosis. G to T transversions, known to be associated with smoking, were marginally more common among patients who developed a second primary lung cancer or recurrence/metastasis (progressive disease). EGFR mutations were almost exclusively found in never-smoking females (p\u003d0.0067). KRAS mutations were detected in 18.5% of cases, mainly ADC (p\u003c0.0001), and showed a tendency toward association with progressive disease status. These results suggest that mutations are good markers of different aetiologies and histopathological forms of lung cancers but have little prognostic value, with the exception of KRAS mutation, which may have a prognostic value in ADC.","title":"Prognostic value of TP53, KRAS and EGFR mutations in nonsmall cell lung cancer: the EUELC cohort.","pubmedId":"22267755"}
