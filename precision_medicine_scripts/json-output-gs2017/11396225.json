Six patients with extremity liposarcoma developed local recurrence and or distal metastases and in three the site of the distal spread was other than the lungs. In only one patient with retroperitoneal liposarcoma we observed extra-pulmonary spread. The histologic type of all four cases with unusual spread was myxoid, with small areas of round cell differentiation in two cases.\nThe survival of the patients after the initial recurrence was relatively prolonged (6, 1.5, 8 and 3 years with the last patient alive and well).\nPhysicians should maintain a low threshold for initiating evaluation of relatively minor symptoms in patients with liposarcoma, as these symptoms may reflect the first manifestation of an extrapulmonary metastasis. Such an approach should result in earlier detection and hopefully improve survival for patients with liposarcoma.","title":"Unusual spread of liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"11396225"}
