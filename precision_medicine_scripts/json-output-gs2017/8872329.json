The present study used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on archival specimens of breast cancer from 37 women under the age of 40 to evaluate the role of HER-2/neu amplification in this cohort, and to also evaluate the efficacy of FISH for quantifying amplification. The frequency of primary tumors with a greater than fourfold increase in gene copy number was found to be 38%, which is similar to the frequency of amplification reported in Southern blot studies in older women. However, the greater sensitivity of FISH enabled detection of low level amplification (more than 2 but less than 8 gene copies), which was found in an additional 30% of the tumors. Patients with low level amplification demonstrated a 54% recurrence rate, compared to 86% in those with high amplification and 17% in those with no amplification. HER-2/neu amplification appeared to be more prognostic of recurrence than nodal status, with 45% of node negative tumors recurring compared to 62% of those which were node positive, nor was tumor size predictive of recurrence in this cohort since tumors of 2 cm or less recurred in 44% of cases compared to 57% of those larger than 2 cm. Thus, this study demonstrates that FISH is a reproducible and sensitive technique for detecting HER-2/neu amplification, and that amplification of the oncogene is the strongest independent indicator of recurrence of breast cancer in young women.","title":"FISH detection of HER-2/neu oncogene amplification in early onset breast cancer.","pubmedId":"8872329"}
