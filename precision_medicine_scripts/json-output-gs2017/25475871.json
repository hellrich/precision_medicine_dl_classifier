It is usually asymptomatic, and can be incidentally diagnosed by conventional imaging studies.\nA 69-year-old woman with a prior history of bilateral breast carcinoma presented with ectopic pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) that was identified incidentally in the small bowel during an oncological resection of a synchronous primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma.\nThe patient underwent subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, regional lymphadenectomy, radical left nephrectomy, and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis of ectopic PanIN-2. She had an uneventful hospitalization and was discharged home on postoperative day 7.\nThe occurrence of ectopic PanIN is extremely unusual with only few cases previously reported in the literature. The need for negative margins after surgical resection of ectopic PanIN lesions remains controversial.","title":"Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia arising from an ectopic pancreas in the small bowel.","pubmedId":"25475871"}
