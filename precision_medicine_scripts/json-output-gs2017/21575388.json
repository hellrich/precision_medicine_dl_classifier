The histologic response rate was 62.5% (35/56) and the overall clinical response rate was 67.9% (38/56). The overall coincidence by both criteria was 78.6% (44/56). Four cases (7.1%, 4/56) had only histological response and 8 cases (14.3%, 8/56) had response by imaging. In comparison with the pre-chemotherapy specimens, the chemotherapy-associated histological changes included shrinkage and scattering of tumor nests,decrease of tumor cellularity,tumor cell degeneration and necrosis.\nThe histological changes in locally advanced cervical cancers induced by NACT are significant, which may challenge the diagnosis in the final specimens. There are some discreqancies between the histological criteria and imaging/gynecological ones for the therapeutic evaluation of cervical cancers,and it is thus recommended to use the pathological criteria for clinic practice.","title":"[Histological evaluation of cervical carcinomas in FIGO stage Ib2/IIa after neoadjuvant chemotherapy].","pubmedId":"21575388"}
