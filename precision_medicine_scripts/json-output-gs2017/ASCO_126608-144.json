The aim of this analysis was to investigate the relevance of Ki-67 LI and age for the identification of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype.  Methods:  A total of 571 female TNBC patients operated and diagnosed at our institution from January 2002 to June 2011 were categorized by Ki-67 LI and diagnosed age. Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test were used for survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to determine the association of Ki-67 LI and diagnosed age with breast-cancer specific survival (BCSS) outcomes. A varying-coefficient Cox model was used to describe the effect of Ki-67 on the BCSS outcomes changing with diagnosed age after adjustment for disease characteristics.  Results:  Of the 571 patients, median age and Ki-67 LI were 50 years and 35%, and median follow-up time of 44.5 months (range 2.2139.1). The 5-year BCSS was 83%. Based on the analysis results, there was no prognostic significance in Ki-67 LI in all patients. When analyzing age of diagnosis as a continuous variable, the hazard ratio (HR) of Ki-67 LI\u003e35% to Ki-67 LI35% of breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) increased in a S-shaped curve with increasing diagnosed age up to about 50 years old and remained higher risks for  high Ki-67 LI. When focused on the patients being diagnosed at age50 years, the BCSS was 84% , respectively, with an adjusted HR low Ki-67 LI vs. high of 0.36 (95 % CI 0.140.99, P\u003d0.04). However, in the patients being diagnosed at age\u003e50 years, low Ki-67 LI revealed to have a better prognosis (adjusted P\u003d0.22, \u003e0.05). Based on the data from the large cohort of a clinical cancer registry, it was demonstrated that Ki-67 LI has different significance in patients of different age groups.  Conclusions:  Lower proliferation measured by Ki-67 has poor prognosis relevance in TNBC of patients diagnosed50 years old, which is different with Luminal A subtype. Further validation of the clinical significance of Ki-67 LI need to be demonstrated, which is essential for this group of breast tumors.","title":"New insights into the prognostic value of Ki-67 labeling index in patients with triple-negative breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_126608-144"}
