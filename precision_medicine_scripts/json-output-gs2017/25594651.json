The laboratory data showed severe inflammatory reactions. Computed tomography revealed an irregular tumor in the left hepatic lobe and swelling of lymph nodes. (18)F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed high uptake by the tumor, with diffuse uptake in the spine. Based on the elevated leukocyte count and FDG-PET findings, the patient was diagnosed with a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-producing tumor (G-CSF, 213 pg/mL). We performed left trisegmentectomy of the liver, bile duct resection, and lymph node dissection. Histologically, the tumor was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with some lymph nodes metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells was positive for G-CSF. Therefore, the tumor was diagnosed as G-CSF-producing cholangiocellular carcinoma. The inflammatory reactions and serum G-CSF level transiently improved immediately after surgery. However, 1 month later, the leukocyte count and serum G-CSF level increased again, and recurrence was observed in the remnant liver. The patient died 3 months after the operation. G-CSF-producing cholangiocellular carcinoma is rare. This tumor progresses rapidly, and surgical treatment for advanced condition should be carefully selected.
