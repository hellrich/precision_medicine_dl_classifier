Several other carcinomas seem to be associated with BRCA2 mutations: pancreas, prostate, larynx, gallbladder, bile duct cancer, and malignant melanoma. We described a case of a 67-year-old BRCA2 mutation carrier of Caucasian, non-Jewish, ethnic origin who successively developed 4 primary malignancies in 30 months: breast ductal carcinoma, chronic lymphatic leukemia, ovarian serous papillary carcinoma, and endocervical adenocarcinoma. This is the first case of 4 primary malignancies in a BRCA mutation carrier, also occurred in such a short observation period. Chronic lymphatic leukemia and endocervical adenocarcinoma have not been yet associated to BRCA2 germline mutation.","title":"Four primary malignancies successively occurred in a BRCA2 mutation carrier: a case report.","pubmedId":"16982466"}
