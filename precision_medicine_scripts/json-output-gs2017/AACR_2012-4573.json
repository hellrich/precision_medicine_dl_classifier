We aimed to clarify the subgroups for enriching the patients with candidate driver genes. Patients and Methods The patients who performed clinical genetic tests at Guangdong General Hospital with primary lung cancer were enrolled. Driver genes were detected by sequencing, high-resolution melting analysis, qPCR, or multiple PCR and RACE methods. Results 524 patients were enrolled in this study and the differences of driver genes among subgroups on histology and smoking status were analyzed. In adenocarcinoma with non-smoker subgroup, EGFR mutation was the most frequently altered gene with 498%, followed by EML4-ALK (93%), PTEN (91%), PIK3CA (52%), c-Met (48%), KRAS (45%), and BRAF (19%). The three most frequently altered genes in adenocarcinoma with smoker subgroup were EGFR (220%), KRAS (120), and EML4-ALK (45%). We only found EGFR (80 %), c-Met (28%), and PIK3CA (26%) alterations in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with non-smoker subgroup. PTEN (161%), PIK3CA (72%), and EML4-ALK (65%) were the three most frequently enriched genes in SCC with smoker subgroup. DDR2 and FGFR2 only presented in SCC with smoker subgroup (44% and 22%, respectively). Among these four subgroups, the differences of EGFR, KRAS, and PTEN mutations were statistically significant. Conclusion The distinct features of driver genes in different subgroups based on histology and smoking status were very helpful to enrich the patients for guiding the future clinical trials target these genes. The study also suggested that we can consider the patients with infrequently alteration rates of driver genes as an orphan disease and should provide special management model with special molecular targeted therapy.","title":"Enriched driver genes based on histology and smoking status in Asian patients with non-small cell lung cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-4573"}
