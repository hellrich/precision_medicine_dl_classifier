Serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients (n \u003d 61), patients with benign pancreatic disease (n \u003d 31), and healthy control subjects (n \u003d 50) were probed in replicate experiment sets by two-color, rolling circle amplification on microarrays containing 92 antibodies and control proteins. The antibodies that had reproducibly different binding levels between the patient classes revealed different types of alterations, reflecting inflammation (high C-reactive protein, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and serum amyloid A), immune response (high IgA), leakage of cell breakdown products (low plasma gelsolin), and possibly altered vitamin K usage or glucose regulation (high protein-induced vitamin K antagonist-II). The accuracy of the most significant antibody microarray measurements was confirmed through immunoblot and antigen dilution experiments. A logistic-regression algorithm distinguished the cancer samples from the healthy control samples with a 90% and 93% sensitivity and a 90% and 94% specificity in duplicate experiment sets. The cancer samples were distinguished from the benign disease samples with a 95% and 92% sensitivity and an 88% and 74% specificity in duplicate experiment sets. The classification accuracies were significantly improved over those achieved using individual antibodies. This study furthered the development of antibody microarrays for molecular profiling, provided insights into the nature of serum-protein alterations in pancreatic cancer patients, and showed the potential of combined measurements to improve sample classification accuracy.","title":"Antibody microarray profiling reveals individual and combined serum proteins associated with pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"16322270"}
