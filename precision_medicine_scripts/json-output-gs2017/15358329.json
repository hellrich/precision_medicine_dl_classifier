The aim of this study was to analyze patient survival, morbidity, and mortality as well as to seek predictive factors. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial patient survival was 72%, 37%, and 22%, respectively. Median survival was 19 months. Hospital mortality, all due to septic complications, was 12%. Morbidity was observed in 32 patients (76%). Infections were the most dominant complication. Patients (n\u003d11) with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I or stage II tumors exhibited a superior survival compared with patients (n\u003d31) with stage III or IV tumors (p\u003d0.023). Patients with tumor-free lymph nodes (n\u003d26) indicated a greater survival compared with patients with tumor-positive lymph nodes (n\u003d16) (p\u003d0.004). Patients undergoing vascular reconstructions indicated a trend toward higher mortality and lower survival (p\u003d0.068). Over 20% of the patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma can survive more than 5 years after a combined EHBDR and LR at the cost of 12% perioperative mortality and a 76% morbidity. Results might improve with the prevention of infectious complications and improved selection of patients to avoid vascular reconstruction and to predict a negative nodal state.","title":"Extrahepatic bile duct resection in combination with liver resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma: a report of 42 cases.","pubmedId":"15358329"}
