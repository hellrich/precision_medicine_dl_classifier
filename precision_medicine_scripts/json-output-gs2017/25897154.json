We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for PFS for the trial population and prespecified subgroups and calculated pooled estimates of treatment efficacy using the fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted method. All statistical tests were two sided.\nIn seven eligible trials (1,649 patients), EGFR TKIs, compared with chemotherapy, significantly prolonged PFS overall (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.42) and in all subgroups. For tumors with exon 19 deletions, the benefit was 50% greater (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.29) than for tumors with exon 21 L858R substitution (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.58; Pinteraction \u003c .001). Never-smokers had a 36% greater benefit (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.37) than current or former smokers (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.63; Pinteraction \u003c .001). Women had a 27% greater benefit (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.38) than men (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.55; treatment-sex interaction P \u003d .02). Performance status, age, ethnicity, and tumor histology did not significantly predict additional benefit from EGFR TKIs.\nAlthough EGFR TKIs significantly prolonged PFS overall and in all subgroups, compared with chemotherapy, greater benefits were observed in those with exon 19 deletions, never-smokers, and women. These findings should enhance drug development and economic analyses, as well as the design and interpretation of clinical trials.","title":"Impact of Specific Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutations and Clinical Characteristics on Outcomes After Treatment With EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Versus Chemotherapy in EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.","pubmedId":"25897154"}
