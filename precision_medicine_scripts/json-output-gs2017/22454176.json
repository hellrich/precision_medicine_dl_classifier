The survival was calculated and univariate analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was conducted by the Cox regression method.\nThe 5-year disease-free survival rate was 61.5% and the 5-year overall survival rate was 67.4%.  The 5-year disease-free survival rates of patients without disease among those with c-kit exon 11 mutation (n\u003d77), c-kit exon 9 mutation(n\u003d4), and PDGFRA exon 18 mutation (n\u003d2) were 63.4%, 14.3% and 100%, and the 5-year overall survival rates were 70.8%, 50.0% and 100%, respectively. In the patients with c-kit exon 11 mutation, the 5-year disease-free survival rates among those with point mutations(n\u003d26), deletion mutations(n\u003d44), and duplication mutations(n\u003d7) were 87.1%, 44.9% and 80.0%, and the 5-year overall survival rates were 88.1%, 57.0% and 100%, respectively. There were significant differences in overall survival among different factors. Multivariate analysis showed that gene mutation was not the independent factor of prognosis(P\u003d0.492).\nIn GIST patients undergoing surgery without imatinib treatment, mutated genotype is better than wild type in terms of prognosis. Gene mutation is not the independent factor of prognosis in GIST patients.","title":"[Relationship of c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene mutation features with prognosis of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor].","pubmedId":"22454176"}
