Other types of cancer may also benefit from BRAF mutation-targeted therapies. In biliary tract cancer, reported BRAF mutation rates are highly controversial, ranging from 0 to 33% in adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder and 0 to 22% in cholangiocarcinoma. We here analyzed tissue microarrays of a large cohort of biliary tract cancer (n\u003d377) including 159 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, 149 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and 69 adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder for BRAF V600E mutation using a highly sensitive immunohistochemical screening approach implementing the BRAF V600E protein-specific antibody VE1. All VE1-positive cases as well as 42 VE1-negative cases were additionally analyzed by Sanger sequencing. In total, only 5 VE1-positive cases were detected (5/377; 1%). BRAF V600E mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing in all cases. All 5 mutated cases were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (5/159; 3%). None of the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder were VE1 positive. Apart from the subtype restriction of BRAF V600E mutation to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and a female predominance (4 female, 1 male), no significant correlation with clinicopathological data and patient outcome was detected. In conclusion, we demonstrate that BRAF V600E mutation is a rare event in biliary tract cancer, accounting for only 1% of all subtypes, and is restricted to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, we demonstrate that VE1 immunohistochemistry is a feasible approach to routinely screen for BRAF V600E mutation in biliary tract cancer patients, thereby facilitating the detection of rare patients who may benefit from BRAF mutation-targeted therapies.","title":"BRAF V600E-specific immunohistochemistry reveals low mutation rates in biliary tract cancer and restriction to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24309328"}
