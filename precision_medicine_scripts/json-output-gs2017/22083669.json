In the present study, we carried out mutational analysis in her family members to determine the carriers and characterized the mutation by introducing the corresponding mutation (murine KIT-Tyr552Cys) into expression vector possessing murine c-kit cDNA. Mutational analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes of her family members revealed that a 44-year-old son had the same mutation, but at present he had neither apparent symptoms nor images of multiple GISTs. By transfection with the expression vector possessing the murine mutant c-kit cDNA, interleukin-3-dependent Ba/F3 murine lymphoid cells started growing autonomously without any growth factors, indicating that the mutation was considered to be of gain-of-function. Imatinib, a small molecule of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, effectively inhibited autophosphorylation of KIT-Tyr552Cys. Nilotinib, another small molecule of the KIT inhibitor, also effectively inhibited autophosphorylation of KIT-Tyr552Cys. In fact, proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing KIT-Tyr552Cys was effectively inhibited by both imatinib and nilotinib. These findings indicate that the novel type human KIT-Tyr553Cys mutation is the cause of the present familial and multiple GISTs, and that both imatinib and nilotinib might effectively inhibit the growth of GISTs developing in the patients of this family.","title":"Characterization of novel germline c-kit gene mutation, KIT-Tyr553Cys, observed in a family with multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"22083669"}
