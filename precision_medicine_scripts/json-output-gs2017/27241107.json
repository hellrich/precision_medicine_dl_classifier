There are currently no recommended gynecologic screening or clinical surveillance guidelines beyond those recommended for the general population; however, cervical cytology samples must be examined with a high level of suspicion for cervical adenocarcinoma. It is considered prudent to note the established association with PJS and recommend referral for genetic counseling. Complete surgical excision after a diagnosis of atypical lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia is recommended.
