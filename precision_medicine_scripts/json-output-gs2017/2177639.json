To search for a possible relationship between HSRs and proto-oncogene amplification, 16 proto-oncogenes, including ERBB2, were studied by Southern blot analysis in four tumors with two or three HSRs, and in three tumors without HSRs. Only four proto-oncogenes were found to be amplified in at least one tumor each: HST and INT2 (x3), MYC (x2-3), and FES (x greater than 10). The large sizes of the HSRs, which each corresponded to several percent of the haploid genome, were hardly compatible with the low rate of amplification, except for FES and then only if a large adjacent segment was co-amplified. This incomplete correlation was demonstrated by in situ hybridization, using biotinylated probes, which showed fluorescent spots on only one HSR for FES in one tumor and for INT2 in another one. Our results indicate that most of the large amplifications corresponding to HSRs do not involve the proto-oncogenes usually studied in breast cancer. The large amplification of FES, detected in one tumor, may be coincidental.","title":"Proto-oncogene amplification and homogeneously staining regions in human breast carcinomas.","pubmedId":"2177639"}
