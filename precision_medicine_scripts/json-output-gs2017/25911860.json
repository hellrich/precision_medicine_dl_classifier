Kirsten ras (K-ras) gene is considered to participate in the progression from adenoma to carcinoma of colorectal neoplasms. The correlation between K-ras mutation and the prognosis of CRC is sill controversial. This study aimed at quantitatively summarizing the evidence for such a relationship.\nThe literature search was based on Pub Med. Population-based and hospital-based case-control studies concerning K-ras mutation and prognosis were eligible for analysis.\n13 literatures were included in the meta-analysis, with 1 multicenter study and 12 case control studies. Totally, 3771 patients were enrolled in the analysis, 1202 of which had K-ras mutation. There were significant difference between the survival of patients with normal and mutated K-ras gene, but no statistic differences were found between either Condon 12 or Condon 13 mutations and prognosis.\nCurrent available evidences demonstrated the K-ras mutation is a predictive molecular mark of colorectal cancer patients\u0027 survivals, further studies are needed to investigate the race difference and the relationship between certain K-ras mutation and prognosis.","title":"K-Ras mutation and prognosis of colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"25911860"}
