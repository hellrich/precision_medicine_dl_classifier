Preclinical data suggest that PIK3CA mutations may predict for response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors, but that concomitant RAS or RAF mutations may mediate resistance. Methods: Tumor tissues from patients with diverse cancers referred to the Phase I Program for targeted therapy from 10/08 to 05/10 were analyzed for PIK3CA, RAS (KRAS, NRAS), and RAF (BRAF) mutations using PCR-based DNA sequencing. Results: Overall, tumor tissues from 504 patients were analyzed: colorectal, n\u003d103; ovarian, n\u003d60; melanoma, n\u003d55; head and neck, n\u003d48; breast, n\u003d29; endometrial, n\u003d29; cervical, n\u003d22; lung, n\u003d22, soft-tissue sarcoma, n\u003d17; thyroid, n\u003d16; pancreatic cancer, n\u003d11; and others, n\u003d92. PIK3CA mutations were found in 54 (11%) of 504 patients tested. KRAS mutations were identified in 71 (19%) of 368 patients tested, NRAS mutations in 19 (9%) of 220 patients tested, and BRAF mutations in 32 (9%) of 362 patients tested. PIK3CA mutations were most frequent in squamous cells cervical (5/14, 36%), endometrial (7/29, 24%), breast (6/29, 21%), and colorectal cancers (17/103, 17%). KRAS mutations were most frequent in pancreatic (5/9, 56%), colorectal (47/95, 49%), and endometrial cancers (4/21, 19%). NRAS mutations were most frequent in melanomas (12/40, 30%), and endometrial cancers (2/8, 25%). BRAF mutations were most frequent in melanomas (23/52, 44%), and colorectal cancers (5/88, 6%). Irrespective of histology, PIK3CA mutations in comparison to wild-type PIK3CA were more frequently associated with simultaneous KRAS mutations (38% vs. 16% respectively; p\u003d0.001) and simultaneous RAS/RAF (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) mutations (49% vs. 27% respectively; p\u003d0.002). RAS and RAF mutations were usually mutually exclusive; however, there was an endometrial cancer patient with simultaneous KRAS and BRAF mutations and a patient with melanoma with simultaneous NRAS and BRAF mutations. Conclusions: PIK3CA, RAS, and RAF mutations are frequent in diverse tumors. PIK3CA mutations often coexist with RAS and RAF mutations.","title":"Occurrence of PIK3CA mutations simultaneously with RAS and RAF mutations in patients with advanced cancers.","pubmedId":"ASCO_61025-101"}
