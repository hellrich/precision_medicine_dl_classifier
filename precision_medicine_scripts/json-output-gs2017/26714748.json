Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) is one of the deadliest cancer-related proteins and plays a pivotal role in the most aggressive and lethal human cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma where it represents one of the most frequently mutated oncogene. Although therapeutic progresses have made an impact over the last decade, median survival for patients with advanced lung cancer remains disappointing, with a 5-year worldwide survival rate of \u003c15%. For more than 20Â years it has been recognized that constitutively active signaling downstream of KRAS is a fundamental driver of lung tumorigenesis. However, years of pursuit have failed to yield a drug that can safely curb KRAS activity; up to now no approved therapies exist for KRAS-mutant NSCLC. The aim of this review is to discuss the current knowledge of KRAS-mutated NSCLC, touching upon KRAS clinical relevance as a prognostic and predictive biomarker, with an emphasis on novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of KRAS-variant NSCLC.
