For early-stage cervical cancer, laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy is feasible, and radical vaginal trachelectomy with laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy has emerged as a safe option for women who desire fertility preservation. In the treatment of early-stage endometrial cancer, the surgical staging of laparoscopic hysterectomy, peritoneal washings and pelvic lymph node dissection is effective and safe when compared with the same surgery performed via laparotomy. In ovarian malignancies, laparoscopic surgery has been incorporated to manage early-stage cancers.","title":"Application of laparoscopic surgery in gynecological oncology.","pubmedId":"20708506"}
