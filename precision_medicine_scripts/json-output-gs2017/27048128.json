Metastatic ovarian tumors in young age are very rare.\nA 18-year-old female presented with colon cancer which was accompanied by Krukenberg tumor. The present case was a very rare case of metastatic ovarian tumor in very young age. The present patient presented with abdominal pain. On examination, colon tumor was detected and bilateral ovary were almost normal with only slight swelling. During the operation for colon tumor, biopsy of bilateral ovary was performed for histopathological evaluation. Although there were no specific findings in bilateral ovary, microscopic examination revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, diffusely invading the ovarian parenchyma. Diagnosis of colon cancer was made postoperatively and ovarian Krukenberg tumor was confirmed.\nIn case of suspecting colon cancer even in very young patient with normal ovary, biopsy of ovary should be considered for the diagnosis of Krukenberg tumor.","title":"Krukenberg tumor in a 18-year-old-female: a rare case.","pubmedId":"27048128"}
