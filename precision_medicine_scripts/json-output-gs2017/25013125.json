However, physicians often have to deal with small biopsies and consequently with challenging mutation testing. Circulating free DNA (cfDNA) is a promising tool for accessing the tumor genome as a liquid biopsy. Here, we evaluated next-generation sequencing (NGS) on cfDNA samples obtained from a consecutive series of patients for the screening of a range of clinically relevant mutations.\nA total of 107 plasma samples were collected from the BioCAST/IFCT-1002 lung cancer study (never-smokers cohort). Matched tumor DNA (tDNA) was obtained for 68 cases. Multiplex PCR-based assays were designed to target specific coding regions in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, and PI3KCA genes, and amplicon sequencing was performed at deep coverage on the cfDNA/tDNA pairs using the NGS IonTorrent Personal Genome Machine Platform.\nCfDNA concentration in plasma was significantly associated with both stage and number of metastatic sites. In tDNA, 50 mutations (36 EGFR, 5 ERBB2, 4 KRAS, 3 BRAF, and 2 PIK3CA) were identified, of which 26 were detected in cfDNA. Sensitivity of the test was 58% (95% confidence interval, 43%-71%) and the estimated specificity was 87% (62%-96%).\nThese data demonstrate the feasibility and potential utility of mutation screening in cfDNA using IonTorrent NGS for the detection of a range of tumor biomarkers in patients with metastatic lung cancer.","title":"Noninvasive diagnosis of actionable mutations by deep sequencing of circulating free DNA in lung cancer from never-smokers: a proof-of-concept study from BioCAST/IFCT-1002.","pubmedId":"25013125"}
