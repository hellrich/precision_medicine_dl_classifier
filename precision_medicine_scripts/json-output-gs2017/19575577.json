The gene responsible for the development of NF2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) or single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery has been increasingly used in the past decades to treat benign tumors in patients with NF2. These radiotherapy methods are less invasive and can be potentially used to treat multiple tumors in a single session. The risk of inducing malignancy is unclear. Few reports exist of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, meningiomas, or ependymomas occurring after SRT or stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with NF2. The authors present the first documented case of rhabdomyosarcoma following SRT for multiple NF2-associated schwannomas. Compared with patients with sporadic tumors, NF2 patients having a germline tumor suppressor gene defect may be more prone to secondary malignancies after treatment involving radiation therapy.","title":"Radiation-induced rhabdomyosarcoma of the brainstem in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 2.","pubmedId":"19575577"}
