However, whether second-line platinum combination chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib treatment shows similar effects to first-line platinum combination chemotherapy in these patients remains unclear. Therefore, we here aimed to investigate the efficacy of platinum combination chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib treatment in NSCLC patients harboring sensitive EGFR mutations.\nWe retrospectively evaluated the clinical effects of second-line platinum combination chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib treatment in NSCLC patients harboring sensitive EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation) at five institutions. All patients were initially treated with gefitinib (250 mg/day) followed by platinum combination chemotherapy as second-line chemotherapy.\nBetween January 2006 and December 2012, 42 patients [8 men, 34 women; median age, 63 years (range 39-75 years)] were enrolled. The overall response rate, disease control rate, and median progression-free survival (PFS) were 26.2, 61.9%, and 5.1 months, respectively, after the second-line treatment. The corresponding values for first-line gefitinib treatment were 69.0, 95.2%, and 11.1 months, respectively. Moreover, second-line platinum combination chemotherapy with pemetrexed or bevacizumab-containing regimens was independently associated with improved PFS.\nSecond-line platinum combination chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib treatment in NSCLC patients harboring sensitive EGFR mutations was effective and showed equivalent outcomes to first-line platinum combination chemotherapy. After failure of first-line gefitinib therapy, second-line platinum combination chemotherapy with pemetrexed or bevacizumab might result in improved PFS.","title":"Efficacy of platinum combination chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib treatment in non-small cell lung cancer patients harboring sensitive EGFR mutations.","pubmedId":"25990507"}
