There are many differences between colon cancer and rectal cancer. Recurrence of colon cancer almost always metastasizes to liver and lung Adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated for stage III and high risk stage II. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy is a combination of Leucovorin and 5-FU, or a combination of oxaliplatin, 5-FU and Leucovorin. Combination treatment with VEGF antibody and EGFR antibody has shown no evidence of effectiveness in adjuvant chemotherapy. In rectal cancer, radiation is the standard form of neoadjuvant therapy.
