Based on previous trials which showed second response after switching to another EGFR-TKI, we hypothesized that the reintroduction of gefitinib would lead to disease control rate (DCR) in more than 30% of patients. This was a single-arm, open-label, prospective, phase II trial of gefitinib for the treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Eligible patients had previously responded to, or had experienced disease stabilization with, initial gefitinib treatment for at least 3 months. Prior to retreatment, progressive disease (PD) should be observed, with at least one cytotoxic treatment following initial gefitinib failure. Twenty-three patients were recruited and defined as the intention to treat (ITT) group. Most of the enrolled patients were female (86.9%), never-smokers (91.3%), and adenocarcinoma patients (95.7%). Responses to initial gefitinib were partial response (PR) in 10 cases (43.5%) and stable disease (SD) in 13 cases (56.5%). PR and DCR were observed in 21.7% (5 patients) and 65.2% (15 patients) in the ITT group. Among 14 DNA samples, 13 cases had either exon 19 deletion or L858R point mutation, whereas one patient evidenced the wild-type EGFR gene. Re-initiation of EGFR-TKI can be considered as an option after failure of chemotherapy for those patients who previously controlled to EGFR-TKI treatment.","title":"Retreatment of gefitinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who previously controlled to gefitinib: a single-arm, open-label, phase II study.","pubmedId":"22333554"}
