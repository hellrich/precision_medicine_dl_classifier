Because the RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST/NRSF) is a transcriptional repressor that is inactivated in neuroendocrine lung cancer, we identified REST-regulated transcripts (CHGA, CHGB, SCG3, VGF, and PCSK1) for evaluation as biomarkers in peripheral blood.\nTranscripts were screened across lung cancer and normal cell lines. Candidates were assessed by reverse transcription-PCR and hybridization of RNA extracted from the peripheral blood of 111 lung cancer patients obtained at clinical presentation and from 27 cancer-free individuals.\nExpression profiling revealed multiple chromogranin transcripts were readily induced on REST depletion, most notably SCG3 was induced \u003e500-fold. The SCG3 transcript was also overexpressed by 12,000-fold in neuroendocrine compared with nonneuroendocrine lung cancer cells. In peripheral blood of lung cancer patients and cancer-free individuals, we found that SCG3 was more tumor-specific and more sensitive than other chromogranin transcripts as a biomarker of circulating tumor cells. Overall, 36% of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 16% of non-SCLC patients scored positively for normalized SCG3 transcript. This correlated with worse survival among SCLC patients with limited disease (n \u003d 33; P \u003d 0.022) but not extensive disease (n \u003d 29; P \u003d 0.459). Interestingly, the subcohort of 6 SCLC patients with resistance to platinum/etoposide chemotherapy all scored positively for peripheral blood SCG3 transcript (P \u003d 0.022).\nSCG3 mRNA, a component of the REST-dependent neurosecretory transcriptional profile, provides a sensitive prognostic biomarker for noninvasive monitoring of neuroendocrine lung cancer.","title":"SCG3 transcript in peripheral blood is a prognostic biomarker for REST-deficient small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"19118055"}
