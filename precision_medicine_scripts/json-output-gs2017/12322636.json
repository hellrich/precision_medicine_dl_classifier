They were given questionnaires to determine their baseline knowledge (multiple choice objective questionnaires) and attitudes (Liker-scale questionnaire) regarding their implementation of breast exam in the field. During the seminar, they were taught the Mamma-Care technique of breast examination with the aid of a videotape and lecture demonstration.  They were then asked to examine silicone breast models which contain lumps of varying sizes (2 cm), mobility and hardness.  Their sensitivity (through positive lumps detected by examination/total number of lumps in the breast model) in detecting lumps was then evaluated.  Correct pretest knowledge on breast cancer symptoms, risk factors, treatment and screening were 83%, 64%, 86%, and 82%, respectively, which improved after training for 93%, 75%, 93%, and 92%, respectively.  Trends in attitudes regarding implementation of breast exam were favorable. Sensitivity rates were 100% (33 nurses/midwives), 80% (48 n/m), 60% (n/m), 20% (17 n/m), and 0% (2 n/m).  Overall sensitivity rate was 62%.  Training and practice of skills among health center workers would enhance the Department of Health program on early detection of breast cancer in the Philippines.","title":"Knowledge, attitudes and practices on breast cancer and breast examination of nurses and midwives in Metro Manila.","pubmedId":"12322636"}
