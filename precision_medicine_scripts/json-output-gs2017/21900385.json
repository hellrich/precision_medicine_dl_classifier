This possible association and PRKAR1A\u0027s possible involvement in pancreatic tumor have not been reported previously.\nNine patients (2.5%) with CNC and pancreatic neoplasms in an international cohort of 354 CNC patients were identified; we studied six of them. Immunohistochemistry and PRKAR1A sequencing were obtained.\nThree men and three women with a mean age of 49 yr (range 34-75 yr) had acinar cell carcinoma (n \u003d 2), adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 1), and intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasm (n \u003d 3). Five patients had a germline PRKAR1A mutation, including two patients with acinar cell carcinoma, for whom mutations were found in a hemizygous state in the tumor, suggesting loss of heterozygosity. PRKAR1A expression was not detected in five of the six pancreatic neoplasms from CNC patients, whereas the protein was amply expressed on other sporadic pancreatic tumors and normal tissue.\nAn unexpectedly high prevalence of rare pancreatic tumors was found among CNC patients. Immunohistochemistry and loss-of-heterozygosity studies suggest that PRKAR1A could function as a tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic tissue, at least in the context of CNC. Clinicians taking care of CNC patients should be aware of the possible association of CNC with a potentially aggressive pancreatic neoplasm.","title":"Pancreatic ductal and acinar cell neoplasms in Carney complex: a possible new association.","pubmedId":"21900385"}
