B-RAF mutation (V600E-B-RAF) leads to melanoma, which is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. A progressive R\u0026D is being done with a direction for improved therapy in the future. Existing melanoma therapy is left out with poor overall survival, drug resistance, side effects. With the recent approval of new drugs, there is a chance of drug change for melanoma patients from limited available drugs. However, there is still need for improved, safe, and complete therapy for advanced melanoma. This review describes melanoma caused by V600E-B-RAF gene mutation, its pathway, drugs available and recently approved drugs, and futures aspects to be overcome.","title":"Advanced Melanoma: A Progressive Review of V600E-B-RAF Kinase And Drugs Inhibiting It.","pubmedId":"27337967"}
