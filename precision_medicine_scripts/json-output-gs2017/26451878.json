Across all species and models used, the nanocrystalline silver coated dressing demonstrated the best antimicrobial activity being as good if not better than all the other dressings. The planktonic cell model was less effective at differentiating the dressings on antimicrobial performance as the immobilized cell model indicating that a diffusion barrier had a significant impact on the performance of some dressings. In the presence of the diffusion barrier, antimicrobial impact of the Honey and PHMB dressings was significantly reduced, particularly in the case of A. baumannii. Activity was at least an order of magnitude lower in the immobilized cell model vs the planktonic cell model.\nThe use of a planktonic cell model within standard tests may overestimate the efficacy of honey and PHMB. The use of an immobilized cell model provides a more demanding test for antimicrobial dressings allowing dressing to dressing and pathogen to pathogen differences to be more clearly quantified.\nThe introduction of planktonic and immobilized cell models as part of testing regimens for wound dressings will provide a more thorough understanding of their antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties.","title":"A systematic comparison of antimicrobial wound dressings using a planktonic cell and an immobilized cell model.","pubmedId":"26451878"}
