Treatment of established fulminant priapism is usually not satisfactory. It is therefore important to prevent this complication of SCD. The alpha-adrenergic agonist etilefrine (50-100 mg/d) produced a good clinical response in 13 of 18 (72%) adults who have recurrent priapism; 17 had SCD and one sickle cell trait. After a follow-up of 1-48 months, none of the 18 people on etilefrine developed hypertension or sexual dysfunction. Similar efficacy and safety profiles of the drug have been reported previously.","title":"Etilefrine for the prevention of priapism in adult sickle cell disease.","pubmedId":"12181066"}
