Clinical evidence has showed that the efficacy of Icotinib on retreating advanced non-small cell lung cancer is comparable to Gefitinib. However, different phenotypes of EGFR can affect the therapeutic outcomes of EGFR tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor. Therefore, our study focused on efficacy and safety of Icotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer of different EGPR phenotypes. Clinical data of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who received Icotinib treatment from August, 2011 to May, 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for survival analysis and comparison. 18 wild-type EGFR and 51 mutant type were found in a total of 69 patients. Objective response rate of patients with mutant type EGFR was 54.9 % and disease control rate was 86.3 %. Objective response rate of wild-type patients was 11.1 % (P \u003d 0.0013 vs mutant type), disease control rate was 50.0 % (P \u003d 0.0017). Median progression-free survival (PFS) of mutant type and wild-type patients were 9.7 and 2.6 months, respectively (P \u003c 0.001). Median PFS of exon 19 mutated mutant patients was 11.3 months, mean PFS of exon 21 L858R mutated mutant patients was 8.7 months (P \u003d 0.3145). Median overall survival (OS) of EGFR mutated patients had not reached. OS time of 13 wild-type patients was 12.9 months (P \u003c 0.001). The common adverse reactions of Icotinib included rash, diarrhea, itching skin with occurrence rates of 24.6 % (17/69), 13.0 % (9/69), and 11.6 % (8/69), respectively. Most adverse reactions were grade I-II. Icotinib has great efficacy in EGFR mutated patients, making it an optimal regimen to treat EGFR mutated patients. Furthermore, most of adverse reactions associated with Icotinib treatment were tolerable.","title":"Effects of icotinib on advanced non-small cell lung cancer with different EGFR phenotypes.","pubmedId":"24777808"}
