Clinical treatments such as trastuzumab are effective in less than 35% of women diagnosed as ErbB2-positive, highlighting the necessity of searching for novel targets and alternative therapies. Herein, a proteomic screening strategy combining quantitative-based gel electrophoresis and MS was used to compare the protein expression of 48 normal human breast and tumour tissues differing in ErbB2 expression and lymph node status. The aim was to identify proteins associated with the aggressive phenotype of ErbB2-positive breast cancer which could be potential biomarkers of the disease as well as therapy targets. In total, 177 protein isoforms (107 gene products) differentially expressed between tissue groups were identified. Immunohistochemical staining of a tissue-microarray was used for validation of selected protein candidates. We found that expression of HSP90α, laminin and GSTP1 significantly correlated with ErbB2 expression, while others such as AGR2, NM23H1 and Annexin 2 were overexpressed in greater than 40% of tumours. Finally, knocking-down the expression by RNA interference of three candidates, AGR2, Transgelin2 and NM23H1 resulted in an enhanced invasive capacity of MDA-MB435 cells. These data support the involvement of these targets in tumour progression and identify them as novel biomarkers of the disease.","title":"Characterisation of tumoral markers correlated with ErbB2 (HER2/Neu) overexpression and metastasis in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"21136925"}
