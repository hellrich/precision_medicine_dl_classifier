The immunohistochemical findings were correlated with P53 mutation analysis using PCR-SSCP, PCR-HDF and direct sequencing, and MDM2 amplification studies by differential PCR. P53 immunopositivity was found in 25 out of 94 (26.6%) cases. Alterations of the P53 gene were detected in 12 (12.8%) tumors; eight of these tumors revealed P53 immunoreactivity. A high number of P53 positive and P53 mutated tumors were histologically defined as poorly differentiated G3 (64.0% and 75.0%, respectively). MDM2 immunopositivity was revealed in 36 out of 94 (38.3%) cases. MDM2 amplification occurred in 17 tumors (18.1%); only nine of these tumors exhibited MDM2 immunoreactivity. Overall, MDM2 positivity was not associated with MDM2 amplification in 27 out of 94 tumors (28.7%). There was no significant correlation between MDM2 overexpression and histological grade. However, when the samples were stratified by immunophenotype, the majority of tumors (52.5%) with isolated MDM2 overexpression (dissociated from P53 positivity) were defined histologically as low grade (G1 + G2). These results support the notion that besides P53 alterations, MDM2 gene deregulation seems to be an important event in sarcomas evolution. Additionally, the mechanism of MDM2-mediated degradation of P53 protein, without involving stabilization and inactivation of P53 gene, should be considered for better understanding of all features of tumor progression processes.","title":"A comparative study of P53/MDM2 genes alterations and P53/MDM2 proteins immunoreactivity in soft-tissue sarcomas.","pubmedId":"10606188"}
