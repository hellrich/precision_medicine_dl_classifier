The brain is one of the most common sites of failure following treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, often as the only site. Treatment strategies and the outcome for brain metastases from lung cancer may differ from brain metastases arising from other primary cancers. This article reviews the prognostic factors associated with brain metastases from lung cancer, as well as current treatment approaches with chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy.","title":"Brain metastases in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"15056056"}
