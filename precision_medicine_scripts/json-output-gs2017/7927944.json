In humans, the FGFR1 gene is located in chromosomal region 8p12. Its amplification and expression were examined in a panel of 110 breast carcinoma samples by Southern- and Northern-blot analyses. FGFR1 was amplified in 9% and overexpressed in about 15% of the tumors studied. In situ hybridization experiments were performed on tissue sections of normal breast and tumors with a high level of FGFR1 expression. In both normal and tumoral tissues, FGFR1 RNA was detected in the epithelial cells. Overexpression of FGFR1 seems to be associated with small, well-differentiated diploid tumors.","title":"Expression of the FGFR1 gene in human breast-carcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"7927944"}
