Mutations in PTEN/MMAC1, a gene recently isolated from the 10q23 region, are responsible for two dominantly inherited neoplastic syndromes, Cowden disease and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome. Somatic mutations of this gene have also been detected in sporadic cancers of the brain, prostate and breast. To investigate the potential role of this putative tumor suppressor gene in endometrial carcinogenesis as well, we examined 46 primary endometrial cancers for LOH at the 10q23 region, and for mutations in the entire coding region and exon-intron boundaries of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene. LOH was identified in half of the 38 informative cases, and subtle somatic mutations were detected in 15 tumors (33%). Our results suggest that of the genes studied so far in endometrial carcinomas, PTEN/MMAC1 is the most commonly mutated one, and that inactivation of both copies by allelic loss and/or mutation, a pattern that defines genes as \"tumor suppressors,\" contributes to tumorigenesis in endometrial cancers.","title":"Somatic mutations of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in fifteen Japanese endometrial cancers: evidence for inactivation of both alleles.","pubmedId":"9765621"}
