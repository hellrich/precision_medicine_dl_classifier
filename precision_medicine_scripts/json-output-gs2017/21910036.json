Hence, the expression of galectin-3 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was evaluated. Galectin-3 expression in PDAC cell lines was proven by the presence of intracellular protein and by release into the supernatant. Furthermore, galectin-3 was found in the majority of human tissue samples. Serum concentrations of galectin-3 in PDAC patients did not differ significantly from healthy donors and did not correlate with established tumor markers. In conclusion, galectin-3 is expressed in PDAC tissues suggesting a role in tumor development; however, no relationship between expression and clinical findings could be established.","title":"Expression of galectin-3 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"21910036"}
