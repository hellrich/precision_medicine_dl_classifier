In the present study, we investigated the incidence of c-MET overexpression and its prognostic impact.\nTumor tissue microarrays were used to detect the expression of c-MET in samples from 287 patients with HCC who underwent surgical resection at Samsung Medical Center. We explored the relationships between c-MET overexpression and clinicopathological features of HCC, and investigated recurrence-free survival (RFS) and HCC-specific survival according to the level of c-MET expression. Additionally, we explored the correlation between c-MET protein overexpression, and MET mRNA expression and copy number variation.\nMost patients in the present study were male (n\u003d297, 82.6%), with Child-Pugh class A liver function (n\u003d286, 99.7%) and hepatitis B viral infection (n\u003d217, 75.6%). c-MET overexpression was observed in 80 patients (27.9%), and was not associated with Edmondson grade, tumor size, microvascular invasion, major portal vein invasion or stage. In addition, c-MET expression levels did not affect RFS or HCC-specific survival. c-MET expression was weakly correlated with c-MET copy number variation (r\u003d0.255, p\u003c0.001), but more than half of all patients with c-MET overexpression had a neutral c-MET copy number. c-MET protein expression was very weakly but significantly positively correlated with its mRNA expression (r\u003d0.199, p\u003d0.002).\nc-MET overexpression did not have any prognostic impact on recurrence or survival of patients with HCC undergoing surgical resection. However, 27.9% of patients who had c-MET overexpression could be considered candidates for treatment with c-MET inhibitor.","title":"A survey of c-MET expression and amplification in 287 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24222167"}
