This study aimed to establish the frequency of stop codon mutations in the RTKs, KIT, and PDGFRA, in GISTs and correlate this molecular alteration with protein expression and treatment responsiveness.\nSeventy-nine GISTs were analyzed for both KIT and PDGFRA mutations. Immunohistochemical expression was studied in tissue microarray blocks.\nWe found three rare KIT mutations in exon 11 that induced a stop codon, two at position 563 and one at position 589, which have never been described before. All three tumors were CD117-, DOG1-, and CD34-positive. Two patients with a KIT stop codon mutation did not respond to imatinib therapy and died shortly after treatment.\nThe association between stop codon mutations in KIT and patient survival, if confirmed in a larger population, may be useful in choosing effective therapies.","title":"The KIT Exon 11 Stop Codon Mutation in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors: What Is the Clinical Meaning?","pubmedId":"23423603"}
