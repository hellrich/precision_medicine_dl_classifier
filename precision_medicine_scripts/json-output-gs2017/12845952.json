The predominant postoperative complication was leakage of pancreatic juice, which occurred in similar rates in both groups. No significant differences were noted in the 3-year survival rates between the resection plus intraoperative radiation group and resection alone group (60.0% (n \u003d 5) vs. 50.1% (n \u003d 13) for ampullary cancer; 0% (n \u003d 4) vs. 27.1% (n \u003d 24) for bile duct cancer, respectively). The main causes of recurrence were distant metastasis for ampullary cancer and microscopic residue of carcinoma for bile duct cancer.\nThe combination of intraoperative radiation and resection may add no significant benefit to patients with ampullary and bile duct cancer when compared with resection alone.","title":"Combination therapy of resection and intraoperative radiation for patients with carcinomas of extrahepatic bile duct and ampulla of Vater: prognostic advantage over resection alone?","pubmedId":"12845952"}
