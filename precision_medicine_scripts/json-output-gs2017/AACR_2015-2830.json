The three most common mutations (E542K, E545K and H1047R) in the PIK3CA gene have been confirmed as activating mutations. The strong evidence pointing at the oncogenic nature of the PIK3CA gene mutations and their high frequency have fuelled a strong interest in developing selective inhibitors of PI3K.During the lead generation phase of this project, we identified a series of 2-amino pyridines / pyrazines as potent inhibitors of PI3K both at the enzymatic and the cellular level. However, these initial leads displayed poor general kinase selectivity. We report the optimisation of this series, with a special focus on optimisation of general kinase selectivity. This work led to the identification of AZD8835, a potent inhibitor of PI3K (wild type, E545K and H1047R mutations) and PI3K with excellent selectivity vs. PI3K, PI3K and an excellent general kinase selectivity. AZD8835 is a potent inhibitor of p-Akt in cells sensitive to PI3K inhibition (IC50 0.057 M in PIK3CA mutant human breast ductal carcinoma BT474 cell line) and in cells sensitive to PI3K inhibition (IC50 0.049 M in JeKo-1 B cell line), but not to cells sensitive to PI3K inhibition (IC50 3.5 M in PTEN null breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-468 cell line) or PI3K inhibition (IC50 0.53 M in monocytic RAW264 cell line). Furthermore, AZD8835 displayed high metabolic stability and suitable physical properties for oral administration.In vivo, inhibition of p-Akt was observed at 30 minutes and 8 hours in the PIK3CA H1047R mutant SKOV3 tumour model in mice after chronic oral administration of AZD8835 (25 mg/kg b.i.d.). AZD8835 showed excellent tumour growth inhibition in this same model after chronic oral administration (25 mg/kg b.i.d.). Based on these results, AZD8835 was selected as a clinical candidate for the treatment of PIK3CA-dependant cancers and has recently entered phase I clinical trials.","title":"Discovery of AZD8835, a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K and PI3K for the treatment of PIK3CA-dependent cancers","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-2830"}
