The pathology of 12 cases of lung cancer with TD was adenocarcinoma.\nTD complicating lung cancer was not unusual and could be warning sign indicating occult lung cancer. Physician ought to alert to lung cancer or other cancers when facing aged healthy subjects of sudden TD under unknown origin. The most common physiologic type of lung cancer complicating TD was adenocarcinoma. Hypercoagulation state was the most important cause of TD complicating lung cancer.","title":"[Thrombosis diseases and lung cancer].","pubmedId":"11778503"}
