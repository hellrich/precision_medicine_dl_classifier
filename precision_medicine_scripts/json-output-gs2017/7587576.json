The beta-globin gene was used as an internal control.\nThe amplification rate of C-myc, C-N-ras, C-Ki-ras and C-erbB2 in ovarian carcinoma was 50%, 44%, 31% and 25% respectively. The amplification rates of C-myc, C-erbB2 in stage III and IV were all significantly greater than that in stage I (P \u003c 0.01). The amplification rate of C-N-ras in stage I was also significantly greater than that in stage III (P \u003c 0.01). The amplification rate of C-Ki-ras in stage I was significantly greater than that in stage III or IV (P \u003c 0.01).\nThe amplification of C-Ki-ras and C-N-ras took place chiefly in cases of the early stages and in cases with good differentiation. The amplification of C-N-ras was also found in cases of advanced stages. The amplifications of C-myc and C-erbB2 were chiefly found in cases above stage III and in cases with poor differentiation, 83% of the patients who died were found to have amplifications of more than 2 proto-oncogenes, with the amplification of C-erbB2 involved in all of them.","title":"[Amplification of proto-oncogenes C-myc, C-N-ras, C-Ki-ras, C-erbB2 in ovarian carcinoma].","pubmedId":"7587576"}
