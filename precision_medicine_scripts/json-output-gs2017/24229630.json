RET fusion gene with an identifiable clinical pathological features, is present in some subsets of lung cancer, and its treatment is effective by RET inhibitor, suggesting that RET fusion gene may be a new target for individualized treatment to the subgroup of NSCLC. This article reviews the structural characteristics of RET fusion gene and expression model in clinical samples, and treatment of NSCLC. \n肺癌是当今世界癌症死亡的首位原因，分子靶向治疗是目前肺癌研究的热点。存在于部分肺癌亚群中的RET融合基因具有可识别的临床病理学特征，且RET抑制剂对其治疗有效，提示RET融合基因有可能成为该亚群患者个体化诊治的新靶点。本文将对RET融合基因的结构特征及其在非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）临床样品中的表达和治疗方面的研究进展进行阐述。","title":"[Significances of RET fusion gene in non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"24229630"}
