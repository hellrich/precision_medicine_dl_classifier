Within all subtypes of this disease, ductal adenocarcinoma has the shortest survival time. In recent years, global genomics profiling allowed the identification of hundreds of genes that are perturbed in pancreatic cancer. The integration of different omics sources in the study of pancreatic cancer has revealed several molecular mechanisms, indicating the complex history of its development. However, validation of these genes as biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis or treatment efficacy is still incomplete but should lead to new approaches for the treatment of the disease in the future.
