Despite their histologic similarity with pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs), RGNTs do not harbor KIAA1549-BRAF fusions or BRAF mutations, which represent the most common genetic alteration in PAs. Recently, mutations affecting the hotspot codons Asn546 and Lys656 of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) have been described in PAs. They are considered to be the most frequent mechanism of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, alternative to KIAA1549-BRAF fusion and BRAF mutations. To uncover possible molecular similarities between RGNTs and PAs, we performed a mutational study of FGFR1 in 8 RGNTs. An FGFR1 N546K mutation and an FGFR1 K656E mutation were found in the tumors of 2 patients. Notably, the patient with an FGFR1 K656E mutated RGNT had undergone a resection of a diencephalic pilocytic astrocytoma with pilomyxoid features 5 years before the discovery of the fourth ventricle tumor; the mutational analysis uncovered the presence of the same FGFR1 K656E mutation in the diencephalic tumor. These results indicate that, in addition to histologic similarities, at least a subgroup of RGNTs may show close molecular relationships with PAs. Whether FGFR1 mutated RGNTs represent a specific subset of this rare tumor entity remains to be determined.
