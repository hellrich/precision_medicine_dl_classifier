We previously demonstrated that IL1R2 intracellularly activates the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines and affects cell migration. In this study, we found that intracellular IL1R2 expression was increased in human colorectal cancer cells (CRCs) compared with normal colon cells. We also observed that the mRNA levels of IL1R2 were highly correlated with IL-6 in tumor tissues of CRC patients. By modulating its expression in CRC cells, we verified that enhanced IL1R2 expression transcriptionally activated the expression of IL-6 and VEGF-A. Conditioned medium harvested from IL1R2-overexpressing CRC cells contained higher levels of IL-6 and VEGF-A than that from vector control cells and significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of cultured endothelial cells. We further demonstrated a positive association of intracellular IL1R2 levels with tumor growth and microvessel density in xenograft mouse models. These results revealed that IL1R2 activates the expression of angiogenic factors. Mechanistically, we revealed that IL1R2 complexes with c-Fos and binds to the AP-1 site at the IL-6 and VEGF-A promoters. Together, these results reveal a novel function of intracellular IL1R2 that acts with c-Fos to enhance the transcription of IL-6 and VEGF-A, which promotes angiogenesis in CRC.
