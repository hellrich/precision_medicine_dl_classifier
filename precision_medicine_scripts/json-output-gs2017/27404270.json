We retrospectively investigated the clinicopathological features of colorectal cancers with BRAF D594G mutations.\nWe selected 908 colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection from January 2008 to January 2013, and assessed BRAF, KRAS, microsatellite instability, and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP).\nWe detected BRAF D594G in 7 patients and BRAF V600E in 45 patients. The clinicopathological features of cancers with BRAF D594G mutation were similar to those with BRAF wild-type, but differed from those with BRAF V600E mutations. Regarding microsatellite instability status, 44.4% of cases with BRAF V600E mutations exhibited high microsatellite instability, compared to 14.3% of those with BRAF D594G mutations and 4.4% of those with BRAF wild-type. There were no CIMP-positive tumors in cancers with BRAF D594G mutations, whereas 67.8% of tumors with BRAF V600E mutations were CIMP-positive. In stage IV cancers, the survival rates of patients at 2 years were 8.5, 50.0, and 68.2% in the BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF D594G mutation, and BRAF wild-type groups, respectively.\nColorectal cancers with BRAF D594G mutations exhibit similar clinicopathological features, microsatellite instability status, and prognosis as those with BRAF wild-type.","title":"Colorectal Cancer with BRAF D594G Mutation Is Not Associated with Microsatellite Instability or Poor Prognosis.","pubmedId":"27404270"}
