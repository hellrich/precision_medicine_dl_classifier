We examined its anti-cancer effect on colon cancer. We constructed a recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus carrying human melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (Ad-IL-24) and examined its apoptosis-inducing efficacy on the colon cancer HT-29 cell line and on an oxaliplatin-resistant cell line HT-29/oxa, using a combination of flow cytometry, growth suppressive activity by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and xenografts. Furthermore, we tested the suppression activity of Mda-7/IL-24 on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD), as well as the inductive effect on expression of the growth arrest and DNA damage gene (GADD) in xenograft tumors by immunohistochemistry. Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 can inhibit the growth of colon cancer cell lines and induced apoptosis in about (5.6Â±0.3)% of HT-29 cells (P\u003c0.05). Xenograft growth was retarded in vivo in mice treated with melanoma differentiation associated gene-7, but the tumor proliferation rate for this group was not significantly different in comparison to controls (P\u003e0.05). Furthermore, melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 induced expression of a growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) gene and reduced the expression of both VEGF and MVD in xenograft tumors. This study supports a potential therapeutic effect for melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 on colon cancer.","title":"Antitumor activity of an adenovirus harboring human IL-24 in colon cancer.","pubmedId":"20354907"}
