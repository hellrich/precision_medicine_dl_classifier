The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of rare and complex mutations, and the efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\nWe analyzed 1,431 NSCLC patients who were treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib. Exons 18 to 21 of EGFR were analyzed by PCR and subjected to direct sequencing methods.\nOf 306 patients who had EGFR mutation, 24 patients (7.3 %) had complex mutations. The frequency of rare mutations was 10.3 %. Four groups were categorized [group A (N \u003d 269): classical mutation alone; group B (N \u003d 16): complex mutation with classical mutation; group C (N \u003d 16): rare mutation alone or complex mutation with rare mutation; group D (N \u003d 5); classical mutation with T790M]; the response rate (RR) to TKI was significantly different between each group (RR \u003d 74.8 % in group A vs. 68.8 % in group B vs. 25.0 % in group C vs. 80.0 % in group D, P \u003c 0.001). Progression-free survival (PFS) was also poorer in rare mutations (median PFS: 11.9 vs. 8.1 vs. 1.4 vs. 8.0 months, respectively, P \u003c 0.001).\nNSCLC patients harboring rare mutations did not show consistent and favorable responses to EGFR TKI compared with those harboring classical mutations. However, complex mutations with classical mutations showed similar treatment efficacy toward EGFR TKI to that with classical mutations alone.","title":"Rare and complex mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor, and efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23912954"}
