Six of 14 small cell lung cancers (SCLC) showed a 4-35-fold amplification for L-myc, 5 of 7 non-SCLC a 3-5-fold amplification for c-myc, and 1 of 14 SCLC an 80-fold amplification for N-myc. Of the 7 SCLC with amplified L- or N-myc oncogenes, 4 were of the small and large histological type, while only 5 of the 21 cases studied were of the small and large type. All xenografted tumors with amplification of one of the myc genes showed overexpression of the related mRNA. Overexpression without amplification of the myc genes was observed for 3 SCLC and 2 non-SCLC. These results indicate that the L-myc gene seems to be associated with the small and large phenotype in SCLC, whereas c-myc seems to be implicated in non-SCLC. Of the 21 lung cancers studied 14 were analyzed for myc family gene activation for serial passages into nude mice. No variation of DNA amplification was observed during long-term growth in nude mice for any of the myc oncogenes. Changes in the level of mRNA expression were observed only for c-myc; a beginning of expression in one SCLC and an increase in expression in one non-SCLC were noted in late passages when compared with early ones. The nude mouse is therefore a valuable model for the study of lung cancers \"over a 4-year period at least.\"","title":"Analysis of the activation of the myc family oncogene and of its stability over time in xenografted human lung carcinomas.","pubmedId":"2154327"}
