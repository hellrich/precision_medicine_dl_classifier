Three samples showed c-K-ras2 amplification; none of the other oncogenes tested revealed any gene amplification. 5-, 25-, and 120-fold amplifications were assessed by dilution experiments and soft laser densitometry. Corresponding elevated levels of c-K-ras2 mRNA and p21 ras protein were found in the three tumors. Analysis by the polymerase chain reaction method to detect point mutations of codon 12 or codon 61 of Harvey-, Kirsten-, or N-ras showed only the wildtype sequence in all specimens. No correlation was found between ras activation and degree of tumor progression or histological subtype. DNA from one of the tumors with c-K-ras2 amplification proved to have high transforming activity in the NIH 3T3 tumorigenicity assay, but the transforming gene was not c-K-ras2.","title":"ras oncogene activation in human ovarian carcinoma.","pubmedId":"3285294"}
