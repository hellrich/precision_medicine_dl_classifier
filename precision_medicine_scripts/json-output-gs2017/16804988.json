They are usually found in the lung and upper respiratory tract. However, reporting of cases involving the biliopancreatic region has increased over recent years. Immunohistochemical study of these lesions limited to the pancreatic head or distal bile duct seems to be compatible with those observed in a new entity called autoimmune pancreatitis, but usually intense fibrotic reaction (zonation) predominates producing a mass. When this condition is limited to the pancreatic head, the common bile duct might be involved by the inflammatory process and jaundice may occur often resembling adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. We have previously reported a case of IMT arising from the bile duct associated with autoimmune pancreatitis which is an extremely rare entity. Four years after Kaush-Whipple resection, radiological examination on routine follow-up revealed a tumor mass, suggesting local recurrence. Ultrasound-guided FNA confirmed our suspicious diagnosis. This present case, as others, suggests that persistent follow-up is necessary in order to prevent irreversible liver damage at this specific location.","title":"Recurrence of inflammatory pseudotumor in the distal bile duct: lessons learned from a single case and reported cases.","pubmedId":"16804988"}
