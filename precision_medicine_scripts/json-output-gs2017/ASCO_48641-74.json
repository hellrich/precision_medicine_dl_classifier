Given the high therapeutic efficacy of ALK inhibitors against EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC, accurate diagnosis of the presence of EML4-ALK is indispensable for the selection of eligible patients to be treated with such inhibitors. Here we have developed a practical scheme to diagnose in clinics EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC, and have started a Japanese nation- wide diagnostic network for EML4-ALK as a collaborative project between ALK Lung Cancer Study Group (ALCAS) and North East Japan Gefitinib Study Group (NEJ). Methods: Since different introns of EML4 may be used in the fusion to the intron 19 of ALK, we developed a multiplex RT-PCR system that can capture all possible in-frame fusions between EML4 and ALK. Sputum, pleural effusion, bronchoalveolar lavage or frozen tissues were subjected to the RT-PCR, and positive PCR products were nucleotide-sequenced to determine the fusion point. Further, when paraffin-embedded tissues were available for the tumors positive for EML4-ALK, presence of the encoded protein was confirmed by a sensitive immunohistochemical method, iAEP. Results: A total of 369 samples (corresponding to 329 independent patients) were assayed with the RT-PCR to detect EML4-ALK and an RNase P transcript (as an internal control). Expression of the latter message was confirmed among independent 318 specimens, and EML4-ALK was detected in 19 (6.0%) of them. Paraffin-embedded tissues were available for four of them, all of which showed a clear positivity in iAEP. Subtypes of EML4-ALK detected were variant 1, 2, 3 and novel 1 for 14, 1, 3 and 1samples, respectively. EML4-ALK was enriched in young onset NSCLC (50.2 years  17.3, mean  SD), and was only found in adenocarcinoma without EGFR mutations. Conclusions: Multiplex RT-PCR was proved to be an effective screening system for EML4-ALK among a variety of clinical specimens, and the results with our RT-PCR were well concordant with the analyses with other diagnostic measures.","title":"A Japanese nationwide network for the diagnosis of EML4-ALK-positive lung cancer: A joint study of ALCAS and NEJ004.","pubmedId":"ASCO_48641-74"}
