The primary tumours included 21 adenocarcinomas, nine large-cell carcinomas, 13 epidermoid carcinomas, one carcinoid and three metastases of primaries outside the lung. The copy numbers per haploid genome of 11 protooncogenes in every tumour sample were determined: H-ras, K-ras, N-ras, c-myc, N-myc, L-myc, erbB, mos, myb, ncu (erbB-2) and ral amplifications. The c-myc gene was amplified 5-7-fold in two adenocarcinomas, the H-ras gene 3 5-fold in one adenocarcinoma, while the K-ras and the neu gene were amplified in lung metastases from a colorectal and a breast cancer primary respectively. None of the tumours with an amplified protooncogene simultaneously harboured a mutationally activated K-ras gene. We conclude that amplification of the investigated protooncogenes is a rare event in non-small cell lung cancer. In view of the two c-myc amplifications detected, a systematic study of c-myc expression levels in non-small cell lung cancers appears worthwhile.","title":"Cellular protoonocogenes are infrequently amplified in untreated non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"2547415"}
