Four high-frequency prostate cancer (CaP) specific fusion genes, SDK1:AMACR, RAD50:PDLIM4, CTAGE5:KHDRBS3 and USP9Y:TTTY15 have been reported in Chinese CaP samples through a transcriptome sequencing study. We previously reported that USP9Y:TTTY15 is a transcription-mediated chimeric RNA, which is expressed in both tumor and non-malignant samples, and here we attempted to confirm the existence of the other three fusion genes SDK1:AMACR, RAD50:PDLIM and CTAGE5:KHDRBS3. We detected SDK1:AMACR fusion transcript in 23 of 100 Chinese CaP samples, but did not detect RAD50:PDLIM4 and CTAGE5:KHDRBS3 transcripts in any of those samples. SDK1:AMACR fusion transcript is Chinese CaP specific, which was neither detected in non-malignant prostate tissues adjacent to cancer from Chinese patient nor in CaP samples from UK patients. However, we did not detect genomic rearrangement of SDK1 gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, indicating that SDK1:AMACR is also a transcription-mediated chimeric RNA. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that high level AMACR expression was associated with SDK1:AMACR fusion status (P\u003d0.004), suggesting that SDK1:AMACR fusion transcript may promote prostate carcinogenesis through increasing AMACR expression. However, the fusion status was not significantly correlated with any poor disease progression clinical features. The identification of the SDK1:AMACR fusion transcript in CaP cases from China but not from UK further supports our previous observation that different genetic alterations contribute to CaP in China and Western countries, although many genetic changes are also shared. Further studies are required to establish if CaPs with SDK1:AMACR represent a distinct subtype.
