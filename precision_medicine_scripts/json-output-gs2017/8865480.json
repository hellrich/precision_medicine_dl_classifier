Some men with prostate cancer require transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for relief of these symptoms. Two central questions have been raised regarding whether TURP may have adverse effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with prostate cancer. The first question deals with potential tumor cell dissemination at the time of TURP, resulting increased progression and mortality rates. A review of the literature suggests the risk of tumor dissemination during a TURP is small or negligible. However, patients with prostate cancer and obstructive symptoms appear to have a greater likelihood of high-stage disease at presentation. When the pathological stage is known, progression and mortality outcomes are similar in TURP and non-TURP treated patients with prostate cancer. The second question deals with the potential that TURP increases treatment-related morbidity of radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy. When TURP is required before radiation therapy, the literature suggests that delaying radiation 6 to 8 weeks from the time of the TURP will minimize incontinence and bladder neck contracture to acceptable levels. The literature also indicates that radical prostatectomy may be performed with no increased morbidity following a TURP.","title":"Does transurethral resection of the prostate compromise the radical treatment of prostate cancer?","pubmedId":"8865480"}
