VP-16 is one of the most active agents for several carcinomas and usually administered intravenously over 3 to 5 consecutive days in combination with other agents. Although, the development of new drugs recently reduces the use of VP-16 administration, VP-16 is still an important drug for the treatment of lung cancer and malignant lymphoma. In this paper, the combination therapy with VP-16, especially in the treatment of lung cancer and malignant lymphoma, are reviewed.","title":"[Combination chemotherapy with VP-16 in the treatment of lung cancer and malignant lymphoma].","pubmedId":"11681241"}
