These variables are independently associated with survival, and are fundamental to clinical trial design and data interpretation. Stage at the time of initial diagnosis has not previously been evaluated as a prognostic factor in patients (pts) with metastatic lung cancers, and is not controlled for in prospective trials. In order to adjust for the potential impact of tumor histology and presence of a driver oncogene, we evaluated the impact of stage at initial diagnosis on survival using a cohort of patients with KRAS-mutant, metastatic lung adenocarcinomas.  Methods:  We identified all pts with KRAS-mutant metastatic lung adenocarcinomas from Feb 2005 to Aug 2011. Stage at diagnosis, age, gender, smoking history, and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) were obtained from the medical record.  Overall survival (OS) from date of diagnosis of recurrent/metastatic disease was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared across groups in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.   Results:  635 pts with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas and known stage at diagnosis were identified. Median age: 66 (range 31-89), women: 61%, never smokers: 7%.  KPS was available in 471 pts, median KPS: 80%. When compared to pts with stage IV lung cancers at initial diagnosis, patients with early stage lung cancers that later recurred/metastasized had a longer OS from date of advanced disease (18 vs 13 mo, p\u003d0.003). Advanced stage at diagnosis (4 vs 1-3, HR 1.5 [1.2-1.8], P\u003c0.001) and lower KPS (70% vs 80%, HR 2.5 [2.0-3.2], P\u003c0.001) were independently associated with shorter overall survival after adjusting for gender and smoking history in a multivariable analysis.  Conclusions:  In KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas, stage at initial diagnosis was strongly associated with OS from diagnosis of recurrent/metastatic disease, with a 5 month difference in overall survival in patients with recurrent versus de novo stage IV lung cancers. Stage at diagnosis is a prognostic variable that should be accounted for in prospective randomized studies of new therapies in pts with metastatic lung cancers.","title":"Stage at diagnosis as a prognostic marker for patients with KRAS-mutant metastatic lung adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"ASCO_133953-144"}
