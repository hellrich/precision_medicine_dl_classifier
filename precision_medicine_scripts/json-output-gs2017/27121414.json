Further improvement to the understanding of the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is required. Previous studies using genetically engineered mouse models have demonstrated that oncogenic GTPase KRas (KRAS) mutation is involved in the formation of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and promotes the progression of PDAC. However, attempts to target KRAS directly by pharmacological inhibition have been unsuccessful. This has resulted in increased efforts to identify pharmacological targets and nodes associated with the mutated KRAS. The present review discusses the recent progress and prospects of KRAS signaling in pancreatic cancer. ","title":"Critical role of oncogenic KRAS in pancreatic cancer (Review).","pubmedId":"27121414"}
