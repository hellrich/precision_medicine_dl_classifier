The PCR chip was used for detecting the mRNA expressions of the integrated genes in colorectal cell lines, cancerous specimen and adjacent normal mucosa. The primers for amplification were refined and optimized by several rounds of preliminary reactions.\nThe PCR chip containing the 29 candidate genes and 3 housekeeping genes was successfully constructed, which showed specific amplifications of the genes. The results of the PCR chip for detecting the mRNA of the 29 genes related to colorectal cancer metastasis showed a concordance rate of 86% (25 out of 29) with the gene chip data. Application of the PCR chip in the examination of the clinical specimens identified 15 differentially expressed genes between metastatic colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer without metastasis.\nThe constructed PCR chip is reliable in the prediction of metastasis of colorectal cancer, and provides a molecular means for evaluating the prognosis of colorectal cancer metastasis.","title":"[Construction of a PCR chip for detecting genes associated with metastatic colorectal cancer and its preliminary application].","pubmedId":"21764687"}
