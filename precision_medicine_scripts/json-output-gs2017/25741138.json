PFN1 was knocked down to investigate the role of this protein in cell proliferation and metastasis in the SGC-7901 cell line. To explore the underlying mechanisms, the expression of integrin β1 and the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the downstream proteins extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were measured through Western blot or qRT-PCR analysis. Fibronectin (FN), a ligand of integrin β1, was used to verify the correlation between alterations in the integrin β1/FAK pathway and changes in tumor cell aggressiveness upon PFN1 perturbation.\nImmunohistochemical, Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses revealed that PFN1 expression was higher at both the protein and mRNA levels in gastric carcinoma tissues compared with the adjacent tissues. In addition, high PFN1 expression (53/75, 70.4%) was correlated with tumor infiltration, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in gastric cancer, but not with gender, age, location, tumor size, or histological differentiation. In vitro experiments showed that PFN1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells through the induction G0/G1 arrest. Silencing PFN1 inhibited cell migration and invasion and down-regulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP9. Moreover, silencing PFN1 reduced the expression of integrin β1 at the protein level and inhibited the activity of FAK, and the downstream effectors ERK1/2, P38MAPK, PI3K, AKT and mTOR. FN-promoted cell proliferation and metastasis via the integrin β1/FAK pathway was ameliorated by PFN1 silencing.\nThese findings suggest that PFN1 plays a critical role in gastric carcinoma progression, and these effects are likely mediated through the integrin β1/FAK pathway.","title":"Silencing profilin-1 inhibits gastric cancer progression via integrin β1/focal adhesion kinase pathway modulation.","pubmedId":"25741138"}
