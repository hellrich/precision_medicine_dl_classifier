It is widely accepted that subgroups of patients benefit from elective lymph node dissection. The question of which parameters identify the relevant patients properly is still under discussion. pT-categories are the most important prognostic factor; however, localisation and type of tumour and the sex of the patients are additional parameters influencing patient selection. Recently, the first studies have identified subgroups of nodal positive patients who would profit from adjuvant chemo-/immunotherapy. Therefore, lymph node dissection as a staging procedure has to be discussed in the future. Identification of the sentinel lymph node is receiving increasing attention because of its potential influence on the reassessment of elective lymph node dissection. However, this method needs further evaluation. If lymph node metastases have occurred, the prognosis of malignant melanoma decreases by 20%-50%, depending on the extent of metastasis in the individual case. The relevant topics and results are discussed on the basis of data of the Surgical Department of the University Hospital of Erlangen-Nuremberg.","title":"[Lymph node dissections in malignant melanoma].","pubmedId":"8964150"}
