We report on a 63-year-old patient with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix uteri with an isolated metastasis to the left ovary. Following treatment with concomitant chemoradiotherapy with ifosfamide and cisplatin and three cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with the same drug combination a complete clinical remission could be documented. At present, 35 months after her disease was diagnosed, she is still without any evidence of disease. The very promising outcome of this patient might suggest that combined chemoradiation which is the standard treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer is justified as well in the metastatic setting, provided the metastatic lesion is covered within the usual radiation field.","title":"Long-lasting complete remission of a patient with cervical cancer FIGO IVB treated by concomitant chemobrachyradiotherapy with ifosfamide and cisplatin and consolidation chemotherapy--a case report.","pubmedId":"15032295"}
