She underwent left lower lobectomy and lymph node dissection. Histopathological findings showed well differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma (WDFA). Well differentiated fetal adenocarcinomas are considered to have a histogenesis similar to that of pulmonary blastoma and may be a tumor with one-sided development of pulmonary blastoma showing only an epithelial component.","title":"[A case report of well differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"1402203"}
