It can reach substantial proportions. It is a slow-growing tumor, and the most frequent symptom is nonspecific abdominal pain and diffuse abdominal enlargement. Treatment is radical surgery and complete resection is essential for local control of the disease. We present a case of giant right retroperitoneal liposarcoma, which was well-encapsulated and could be completely excised.
