The lack of knowledge on the mechanisms has probably been one of the most important reasons why no new treatment modalities have been developed to cure the disease. Recent studies, especially those performed by comparative genomic hybridization, have revealed the frequent chromosomal alterations that most likely harbor the genes critical for the progression of prostate cancer. Such genetic aberrations include losses of 8p, 10q, 16q, and 13q as well as gains of 7p, 7q, 8q, and Xq. Unfortunately, the target genes for these alterations are, in most of the cases, not known. We have recently identified the androgen receptor (AR) gene as a target gene for the Xq12 amplification found in one-third of the hormone-refractory prostate cancer. The findings suggest that the AR gene amplification and overexpression is involved in the emergence of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.","title":"Molecular biology of progression of prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"10325488"}
