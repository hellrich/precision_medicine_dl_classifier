Therapeutic approaches mainly involve the epidermal growth factor receptor family, insulin-like growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. Therapeutic agents targeting these receptors include the monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab, and the small-molecule inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Other small-molecule and dual inhibitors are in development, some of which have been demonstrated to have higher efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer. The selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors continue to be valuable in the endocrine therapy of breast cancer. These drugs have been shown to have higher efficacy than conventional therapy agents, and to have extensive potential, especially in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.\nApproved agents including epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted inhibitor, selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors continue to be valuable in treating breast cancer. To overcome the acquired resistance caused by these agents and to enhance the therapy effect, the development of new and specific dual inhibitors targeting various growth factor receptors will be important in the future.","title":"New agents in development for breast cancer.","pubmedId":"17218855"}
