Previous study showed that overexpression of miR-21 was associated with recurrence in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of miR-21 expression and clinic pathologic data and to investigate whether the effect of miR-21 through PTEN pathway.Materials and Methods: A total of 120 female breast cancer patients, who were enrolled at a single medical center in Taichung. MiR-21, PTEN, hormone receptor (estrogen receptor,progesterone receptor) andHER-2 (human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) receptor were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. The function of invasion and migration of four breast cancer cell lines (T-47D, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474) were analyzed by invasion and migration assay and wound healing assay.Results: Our data showed that no significantly difference was found between miR-21 and PTEN. MiR-21 expression was positive correlated with HER-2/neu mRNA levels (P\u003d0.038). Patients with high miR-21 level had poor disease-free survival (p\u003d0.047) compared with low miR-21 level patients. In addition, patients with high PTEN level had poor disease-free survival (P\u003d0.024). We also found that patients with miR-21 high/ HER-2/neu high or miR-21 high/ PTEN high had poor disease-free survival (miR-21/HER-2/neu, p\u003d0.009; miR-21/PTEN, p\u003d0.003). Thus, we suggested that the expressions of miR-21, HER-2/neu and PTEN play important roles in prognosis and associated with recurrence in breast cancer. These results were also confirmed in cell model experiments.Conclusion: In this study, we found that the expression of miR-21, HER-2/neu, and PTEN were associated with the recurrence of breast cancer in Taiwan. Thus, we suggested that the other pathways maybe involved in miR-21 mediated pathogenesis of breast cancer.","title":"The association of miR-21, HER-2/neu, and PTEN expression and clinical outcome of breast cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-1470"}
