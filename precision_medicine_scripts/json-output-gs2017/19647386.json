The aim of this study was to evaluate current management and prognosis of ICC in nine French administrative areas, which are covered by population-based cancer registries.\nBetween 1997 and 1998, 1100 cases of primary liver cancer were observed in nine French departments: 68 were ICC. Clinicopathological characteristics and applied treatments were recorded and a comparative analysis and a 5-year survival study were performed.\nIn most cases (85%), the presence of symptoms was the principal mode of discovery. Histological confirmation revealed ICC in two thirds of cases. The remaining liver was normal in 72% of cases (patients with cirrhosis: 12%). The mean size of tumours was 6 cm. Metastases were present in one out of four cases. Surgical management, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were performed in 40%, 20% and 11.5% of patients, respectively. Hepatic surgical resection was correlated with age and bilirubin level. One third of the patients were treated for symptoms. Five-year survival rate was 7.4% and median survival was 7 months. Patients with hepatic surgical resection had 5-year survival rate of 24.5%.\nAt present, complete resection is the only therapy offering possible long-term survival in this entity. New adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery must be offered to these patients.","title":"[Current management and prognosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in France].","pubmedId":"19647386"}
