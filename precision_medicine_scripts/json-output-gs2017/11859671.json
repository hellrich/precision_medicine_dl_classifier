The evolution was normal during the follow-up period (22 months). Scrotal liposarcoma is a rare tumour: less than 100 cases were reported in literature. The diagnosis is difficult, clinical and radiological signs are the same as those of any intrascrotal tumour. Orchidectomy is the usual treatment, prognosis depends on the histological features, it is usually better than that of other paratesticular sarcomas. It did not need any additional treatment.","title":"[Myxoid liposarcoma of the spermatic cord].","pubmedId":"11859671"}
