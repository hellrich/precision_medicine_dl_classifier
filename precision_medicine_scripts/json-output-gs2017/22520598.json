In 2009, the \u0027Aquitaine platform of molecular tumour genetics\u0027 (PGMC) developed a programme to evaluate and to improve the organisation of molecular cancer analyses, particularly the analysis of the KRAS gene. The objective was to describe the analysis process, the organization of pathology laboratories and the delays between the different phases of the process.\nWe established a working group to describe the different steps between the prescription of molecular biology analyses and the analysis report. A retrospective study based on the first quarter of 2009 allowed us to measure management delays. In addition, a pathology laboratory organisational questionnaire allowed us to identify organisational features hindering rapid delivery.\nThe median delay between the analysis prescription and the results was 15 days (range: 7-78 days). Practices explaining longer delays were highlighted not only in the pathology laboratories (for example, pending of the prescription before sending the analysis, waiting for several cases before sending the material, sample slicing, sending by standard mail), but also within the PGMC (for example, sample testing by another technique or new extraction for non-contributory samples).\nThe results of this study emphasise the necessity of speeding up pre-analytical phases, and of creating an electronic procedure and regional facilities in order to provide results more rapidly to clinicians.","title":"[KRAS analysis management: Process and delays].","pubmedId":"22520598"}
