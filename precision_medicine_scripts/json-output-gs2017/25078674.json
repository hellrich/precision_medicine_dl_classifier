The 5-year survival of \u003c 5% has not changed in decades. In contrast to other major cancers, the incidence of PDAC is increasing.\nThe aims of this paper are first to analyze why PDAC is so difficult to treat and, second, to suggest future directions for PDAC therapeutics. The authors provide an article that is based on a comprehensive search through MEDLINE and the clinicalTrials.gov website.\nProgress has been made recently. Notably, FOLFIRINOX or nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine provide survival benefit over gemcitabine alone, which was previously the mainstay of therapy for PDAC. Most of the current trials are testing combinations of repurposed drugs rather than addressing key targets in the PDAC pathogenesis. It is clear that to really make an impact on this disease, it will be necessary to address three different problems with targeted therapeutics. First, it is important to eradicate PDAC stem cells that result in recurrence. Second, it is important to reduce the peritumoral stroma that provides the tumors with growth support and provides a barrier to access of therapeutic agents. Finally, it is important to address the marked cachexia and metabolic derangement that contribute to morbidity and mortality and further complicate therapeutic intervention.","title":"Challenges and future directions in therapeutics for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25078674"}
