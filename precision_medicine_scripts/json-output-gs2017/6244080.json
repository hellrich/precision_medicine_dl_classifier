COLO 222 is characterized on the basis of histochemical, ultramorphological, and cytogenetic properties, along with isozyme phenotype and cell products. A chromosome mode of 53 predominates and unique Giemsa-banded marker chromosomes are identified. An autochthonous lymphoid cell line, COLO 143v, was established after the addition of exogenous Epstein-Barr virus. Cytogenetic analysis of Colo 143v is consistent with a normal male karyotype. COLO 143v possesses B-cell characteristics. This autochthonous system had been used for immunological studies and cytotoxicity assays.","title":"A human liposarcoma cell line producing hyaluronic acid.","pubmedId":"6244080"}
