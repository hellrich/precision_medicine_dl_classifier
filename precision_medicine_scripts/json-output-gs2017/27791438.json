It is also a journey into unknown territory, a search for beauty, a battle of life against death, eros struggling with thanatos. In this narrative, you will find personal details of the life of a pancreatic cancer patient, his daily struggles, his treatments, his medications, but you will also find his search for the meaning of life itself embedded in his unfolding story, his attempt to come to terms with the questions of why we live and what we might consider to be a genuinely fortunate life.","title":"Moving Into Stage IV: Pancreatic Cancer.","pubmedId":"27791438"}
