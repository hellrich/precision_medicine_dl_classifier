Amplification is usually detected in tumor samples remaining after pathologic work-up, preventing the examination of small tumors.\nTumor imprints that contained low numbers of contaminating normal cells were obtained from small tumors. The prognostic value of erb-B2 and myc amplification in imprint breast preparations was examined, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine gene copy number. Tumor material was obtained from 162 patients with breast cancer operated 1975-1976.\nAmplification of erb-B2 existed in 21% and myc in 16% of the patients. Both erb-B2 and myc amplification showed prognostic significance in univariate analysis for survival and relapse free survival. In multivariate analysis, erb-B2 was a significant factor. In small tumors less than 13 mm in greatest dimension, erb-B2 showed prognostic significance for survival but not for relapse free survival.\nThe use of imprints/PCR allows the detection of gene amplification in breast cancer. The procedure is suitable for the analysis of small tumors and can be used to examine very small tumors, such as those detected mammographically.","title":"Prognostic value of erb-B2 and myc amplification in breast cancer imprints.","pubmedId":"7743470"}
