Especially squamous cell carcinomas of the lung and the head and neck show this genetic alteration in high frequencies. In these cancers FGFR1 is not only a therapeutic target but does also serve as a biomarker that correlates with parameters of worse outcome. However, since FGFR1 amplification does not always correlate with high protein expression defining the best predictive biomarker for a FGFR1 targeted therapy is of great importance.
