These pacemaker cells form a complex network intercalated between the autonomic nerves and the muscle walls of the gastrointestinal tract and are called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). The c-kit receptor (CD117) is a sensitive marker for ICC. The aim of our study was to support the hypothesis that GANTs show ICC differentiation. Seven GANTs without convincing smooth muscle or neural differentiation all showed homogeneous reactivity for the c-kit receptor. CD34 was positive in three cases. On electron microscopy, the typical features of GANT were present. Six tumors contained skeinoid fibers. Most tumors were related to the small bowel. They presented as single (two cases) or multiple (five cases) tumors. The presenting symptoms were abdominal bleeding (2), abdominal mass (2), anemia (1), and small-bowel perforation (1). In two cases, liver metastases developed. Because of the close immunohistochemical and electron microscopic similarities of these tumors to the interstitial cells of Cajal, the term gastrointestinal pacemaker cell tumor seems appropriate.","title":"Gastrointestinal pacemaker cell tumor: clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural study with special reference to c-kit receptor antibody.","pubmedId":"10782882"}
