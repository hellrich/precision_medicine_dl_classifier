Less than 20% of all cases are potentially cured by surgical resection, while the large majority of cases are deemed either unresectable or metastatic upon diagnosis. Advances in treating locally advanced pancreatic cancer have been few and modest. In this year\u0027s American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, three abstracts (#252, #254, #313) were presented with novel approaches towards treating locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Surgery for recurrent disease, a promising new chemoradiation regimen, and the application of an exciting multi-agent regimen (FOLFIRINOX: oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil) in a non-clinical trial setting, highlight the novel approaches focused on the management of this difficult disease.","title":"Locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma: update and progress.","pubmedId":"22406589"}
