We retrospectively investigated the clinicopathologic features and prognostic effects of gastric GIST in patients with synchronous gastric cancer.\nThe study enrolled 170 patients with gastric GIST, who had undergone complete surgical resection (R0) from January 2000 to December 2011. Forty-two patients had synchronous gastric cancer (CA Group), whereas 128 did not (Non-CA Group). The clinicopathologic features and potential prognostic factors in the two groups were compared.\nPatients in the CA Group had more obvious symptoms, but a lower rate of preoperative diagnosis of gastric GIST (P \u003c0.05). The two groups differed significantly in gender, age, greatest tumor diameter, risk stratification, tumor-associated ulcers, and CD117 and CD34 expression (P \u003c0.05 each). Univariate analysis showed that age, risk stratification, postoperative oral imatinib and synchronous gastric cancer were predictive factors of survival (P \u003c0.05). Cox regression analysis showed that risk stratification, postoperative oral imatinib and synchronous gastric cancer were independent predictors of survival (P \u003c0.05). Stratified analysis showed that the 5-year overall survival rate was lower in patients with synchronous gastric cancer than in those without synchronous gastric cancer.\nGastric GIST with synchronous gastric cancer had a lower rate of preoperative diagnosis, with correct diagnosis often missed. Survival, however, depended primarily on the gastric cancer.","title":"Prognostic analysis of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor with synchronous gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"24479763"}
