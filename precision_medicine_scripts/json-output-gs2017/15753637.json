None of the clinicopathological factors correlated with p16(INK4), cdk4, or Rb expression separately. A low p16(INK4)/cdk4 ratio was significantly associated with a high disease stage (p \u003d 0.04), and the ratio tended to be lower in mucinous than nonmucinous tumors. BACs with a low p16(INK4)/cdk4 ratio showed significantly higher Rb expression levels (p \u003d 0.02). Univariable survival analyses showed a significantly lower 5-year survival probability in patients with a high stage (p \u003d 0.002) or low p16(INK4)/cdk4 ratio (p \u003d 0.01).\nThe results suggest a role of the cdk4/p16(INK4) pathway in the prognosis of BACs. Further studies are warranted to clarify whether a low p16(INK4)/cdk4 ratio may identify tumors that are destined to behave unfavorably.","title":"Role of cdk4, p16INK4, and Rb expression in the prognosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinomas.","pubmedId":"15753637"}
