Approximately 30% of sporadic breast cancer samples express low levels of LKB1. This suggests that the LKB1 gene may be related to the tumorigenesis of breast cancer. We reintroduced LKB1 into MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells that lack the LKB1 gene to investigate how overexpression of LKB1 affects tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Overexpression of the LKB1 protein in breast cancer cells resulted in significant inhibition of in vitro invasion. In vivo, LKB1 expression reduced tumor growth in the mammary fat pad, microvessel density, and lung metastasis. LKB1 overexpression was associated with down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2, matrix metalloproteinase-9, vascular endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of the LKB1 protein in human breast cancer is significantly associated with a decrease in microvessel density. Our results indicate that LKB1 plays a negative regulatory role in human breast cancer, a finding that may lead to a new therapeutic strategy.","title":"Enhanced expression of LKB1 in breast cancer cells attenuates angiogenesis, invasion, and metastatic potential.","pubmedId":"17114342"}
