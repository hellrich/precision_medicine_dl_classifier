Fatty acid profiles were investigated using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Sialic acid (SA) and cytokeratins were measured by the thiobarbituric acid and immunoradiometric methods, respectively.\nAt least one of the main fatty acids might be used as a biomarker for every type of lung cancer: arachidonic (20:4n6), linoleic (18:2n6), and stearic (18:0) acids for ADC, SCC, and SCLC, respectively. These fatty acids showed diagnostic yields and operating characteristics similar to or higher than the commonly used SA or cytokeratin markers.\nFatty acids from erythrocyte total lipids might be used as diagnostic biomarkers of lung ADC, SCC, and SCLC. Their use in different aspects of the disease process needs to be explored.","title":"Erythrocyte fatty acids as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of advanced lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"24926094"}
