Here, we determined HER1-4 receptor and neuregulin-1 (NRG1) ligand mRNA expression levels in breast cancers and corresponding normal breast tissue from patients previously characterized for plasma and tissue estrogen levels. In tumours from postmenopausal women harbouring normal HER2 gene copy numbers, we found HER2 and HER4, but HER3 levels in particular, to be elevated (2.48, 1.30 and 22.27 -fold respectively; P\u003c0.01 for each) compared to normal tissue. Interestingly, HER3 as well as HER4 were higher among ER+ as compared to ER- tumours (P\u003d0.004 and P\u003d0.024, respectively). HER2 and HER3 expression levels correlated positively with ER mRNA (ESR1) expression levels (r\u003d0.525, P\u003d0.044; r\u003d0.707, P\u003d0.003, respectively). In contrast, EGFR/HER1 was downregulated in tumour compared to normal tissue (0.13-fold, P\u003c0.001). In addition, EGFR/HER1 correlated negatively to intra-tumour (r\u003d-0.633, P\u003d0.001) as well as normal tissue (r\u003d-0.556, P\u003d0.006) and plasma estradiol levels (r\u003d-0.625, P\u003d0.002), suggesting an inverse regulation between estradiol and EGFR/HER1 levels. In ER+ tumours from postmenopausal women, NRG1 levels correlated positively with EGFR/HER1 (r\u003d0.606, P\u003d0.002) and negatively to ESR1 (r\u003d-0.769, P\u003d0.003) and E2 levels (r\u003d-0.542, P\u003d0.020). Our results indicate influence of estradiol on the expression of multiple components of the HER system in tumours not amplified for HER2, adding further support to the hypothesis that cross-talk between these systems may be of importance to breast cancer growth in vivo.
