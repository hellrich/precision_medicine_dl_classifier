Family history of colorectal cancer, N-acetyltransferase (NAT2), and glutathione-S-transferase (GSTM-1) are studied with Western diet and age at diagnosis.\nA significant interaction between age at time of diagnosis, Western dietary pattern, and family history of colorectal cancer (p for interaction \u003d 0.03) was detected. Those with a family history of colorectal cancer who ate a predominantly Western diet were at increased risk of colon cancer (OR 14.0, 95% CI 3.9-50.1 for \u003c or \u003d 55 years; OR 7.7, 95% CI 2.0-29.1 for 56-66 years; OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.2 for \u003e or \u003d 67 years) compared to those without a family history of colorectal cancer and low levels of a Western diet. Associations with the Western diet were stronger than individual components of the dietary pattern. Neither NAT2 nor GSTM-1 showed significant interaction with Western diet.\nThe extent to which diet comprising a Western dietary pattern influences risk of colon cancer is dependent on age. This dietary pattern also appears to modulate the colon cancer risk associated with a family history of colon cancer.","title":"Western diet, family history of colorectal cancer, NAT2, GSTM-1 and risk of colon cancer.","pubmedId":"10680724"}
