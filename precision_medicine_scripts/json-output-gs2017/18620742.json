The radical trachelectomy is usually performed vaginally despite the initial use of laparoscopy for the lymphadenectomy. The complexity of a laparoscopic abdominal trachelectomy may explain this dual approach. Here we describe the surgical technique of a robot-assisted laparoscopic radical trachelectomy with lymphatic mapping using a radiotracer and without a vaginal approach.\nTwo nulliparous women with early cervical cancer underwent a laparoscopic radical trachelectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy with the assistance of the da Vinci robot (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, CA). After the sentinel lymph nodes were found negative on frozen section, the parametria, paracolpia and sacrouterine ligaments were dissected sparing the main branches of the uterine arteries. Following ligation of the descending branches of the uterine arteries the cervix and the vagina were transsected using monopolar diathermia and the vagina was sutured to the remaining cervix. Finally, a permanent cerclage was placed. Time for surgery was 387 and 358 min respectively. No perioperative complications were noted and the postoperative period was uneventful in both cases.\nRobot-assisted laparoscopic abdominal trachelectomy is a feasible alternative to a combined laparoscopic and vaginal approach.","title":"Robot-assisted abdominal laparoscopic radical trachelectomy.","pubmedId":"18620742"}
