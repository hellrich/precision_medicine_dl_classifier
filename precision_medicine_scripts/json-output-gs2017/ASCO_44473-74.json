The identification of factors important in the spread of localized cancer to distant sites is therefore critical. The non-canonical Wnt pathway is involved in the regulation of cellular motility and morphology and is increasingly implicated in cancer metastasis. We have identified a nuclear transcription factor PITX2 which is highly expressed in metastatic PCa, transduces non-canonical Wnt signaling and appears to enhance cellular motility and metastatic potential of a widely studied PCa cell line. Methods: Clinical samples of normal, primary and metastatic PCa were analysed using Wnt pathway Real-time PCR arrays. Immunohistochemistry using a specific anti-PITX2 antibody was also performed on tissue microarrays of primary and metastatic PCa. Effects of altered PITX2 expression and non-canonical Wnt activation on cellular motility were investigated in PC3 cell cultures by treatment with noncanonical Wnt pathway agonists accompanied by PITX2 over-expression or knockdown. Results: Comparison of transcript and protein levels in clinical samples showed incremental expression of PITX2 with progression from primary to metastatic PCa, with the latter expressing transcripts ~13000 fold higher than normal prostate. Functional characterisation of PITX2 over-expression and knockdown in the PC3 cell line indicated that PITX2 enhanced cellular motility specifically through transduction of noncanonical Wnt pathway signaling. Conclusions: These data support a pivotal role for the noncanonical Wnt pathway in enhancement of cellular motility and metastasis of PCa and indicate that this process is mediated by the transcription factor PITX2. Significantly increased PITX2 expression in clinical samples was associated with progression from normal prostate to metastatic disease. This novel role for PITX2 and the noncanonical Wnt pathway in PCa metastasis may represent a therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of metastatic PCa.","title":"Prostate cancer metastasis, the noncanonical Wnt pathway, and the transcription factor PITX2.","pubmedId":"ASCO_44473-74"}
