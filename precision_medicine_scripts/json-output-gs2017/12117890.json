In addition, microdeletion of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) were assessed by differential PCR.\nMethylation of p14(ARF) was found in 3/25 cases (12%) and alterations in p16(INK4a) occurred in 6/25 liver cell adenomas (24%) which correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. We failed to detect microdeletions or specific mutations of both exons. p16(INK4a) methylation appeared in the context of an unmethylated p14(ARF) promoter in six cases. In normal liver tissue, p14(ARF) or p16(INK4a) alterations were not observed.\nOur data suggest that p14(ARF) methylation occurs independently of p16(INK4a) alterations in liver cell adenomas. Furthermore, methylation of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) may be a result of cell cycle deregulation and does not seem to be a prerequisite of malignancy.","title":"INK4a-ARF alterations in liver cell adenoma.","pubmedId":"12117890"}
