SERMs such as toremifene, raloxifene and tamoxifen suppressed the proliferation of prostate epithelial and stromal cells whereas anti-androgens did not. In prostate stromal cells, the transactivation activities of ER were enhanced by adding E(2) and reduced remarkably by toremifene. The results indicate that the ER-mediated pathway plays a central role in the growth of normal prostate cells.","title":"Effect of selective estrogen receptor modulators on cell proliferation and estrogen receptor activities in normal human prostate stromal and epithelial cells.","pubmedId":"19468285"}
