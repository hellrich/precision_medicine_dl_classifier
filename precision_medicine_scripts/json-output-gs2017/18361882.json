Material for study was obtained in 97% of the cases (96/99) by means of endoscopic biopsy and by tomography-guided needle biopsy in the remaining 3% (3/99). Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nThe 92 men (92.9%) and 7 women (7.1%) in the study had a mean (SD) age of 62.9 (10.4) years (range, 36-81 years); 39.4% (n\u003d39) and 60.6% (n\u003d60) of the subjects had limited and disseminated disease, respectively. ERBB2 protein overexpression was observed in 26.3% of the patients (n\u003d26), 15.4% (n\u003d4) of whom had limited disease and 84.6% (n\u003d22) of whom had disseminated disease (P\u003d.005). Although mean survival was slightly longer for patients who were negative for ERBB2 protein overexpression, the difference was not statistically significant. FISH identified gene amplification in 6.3% (1 in 16) of the studied cases (ratio, 2.3).\nThe protein product of the ERBB2 oncogene is overexpressed in 33.3% of small cell lung carcinomas and is associated with the presence of disseminated disease. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the possible benefits of specific treatment.","title":"[Prognostic value of ERBB2 amplification and protein expression in small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"18361882"}
