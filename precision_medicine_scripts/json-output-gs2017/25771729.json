PIK3CA was reported to harbor the hot-spot in many types of tumor. Akt, the downstream of PI3K, its family members especially AKT2 activation in human cancer has been extensively studied, but its activation by mutation was less reported. The occurrence of PIK3CA and AKT2 mutations in a variety of cancers indicates their important involvement in carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated their mutation frequencies in gastric cancer (GC) in China. In our study, we selected hot-spot related exons 9, 18 and 20 of PIK3CA and kinase domain exons 6-14 of AKT2 genes were screened in 10 GC cell lines, 100 advanced primary GC and matched normal tissues. Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and DNA sequencing were used to analyze the mutations in the two genes. Two point mutations in the PIK3CA gene were identified in 4 of 10 GC cell lines and in 4 of 100 GC primary tumors. Two polymorphisms in AKT2 were detected in 19 of 100 GC primary tumors. One point mutation in AKT2 was detected in 1 of 10 GC cell lines and 3 of 100 GC primary tumors but no hot spot variation was detected. Our results indicate that PIK3CA and AKT2 mutations occurred at low frequency in GC, and suggest that the PIK3CA/AKT2 pathway might engage other events during gastric carcinogenesis.
