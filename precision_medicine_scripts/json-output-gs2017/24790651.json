Imatinib has entered the clinical arena in the last decade and substantially improved the outcome in these formerly untreatable cancers. However, most advanced GISTs responding to imatinib progress within 2-3 years due to heterogeneous subclones harboring a range of imatinib-resistant secondary KIT mutations. Sunitinib, and more recently, regorafenib, have obtained US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of GISTs after imatinib failure, and thus expanded the treatment options in resistant disease. Within this framework, we present an evaluation of current GIST management, emphasizing the most recent advances in the field together with a discussion on future steps to be taken in refractory disease.
