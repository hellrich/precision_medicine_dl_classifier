The trend of this type of cancer within this group of all dissected cancer patients was followed. Absolute increase rates of 48% for males and 32% females could be calculated. An increasing incidence of pancreatic cancer was observed not only in the 7th and 8th decade of live--as was typical so far--but also from the age of 50 years onwards. Rates of increase were also found with regard to all cancer autopsies: 6% for males and 34% for females. The data agree with other observations of an increased pancreatic cancer incidence in all industrialized countries.","title":"[Epidemiology of cancer of the exocrine pancreas 1979-88 in the area of Dresden].","pubmedId":"2091670"}
