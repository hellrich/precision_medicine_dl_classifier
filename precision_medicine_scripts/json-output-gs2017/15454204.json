The medical history and treatment plan for a 7.5-year old male breast cancer patient is described. Radical mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy was performed in October 2002. As no malignant cells were detected in the sentinel node, and no BRCA1-2 mutations were detected, no further radio- or chemotherapy was performed. A \"wait-and-see\" policy was decided on. Further treatment will be given if this becomes necessary with the development of metastases.","title":"Secretory breast cancer in a 7.5-year old boy.","pubmedId":"15454204"}
