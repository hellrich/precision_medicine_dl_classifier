This study evaluated the efficacy of a triple gene analysis using samples obtained via endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). Methods Either metastatic lymph nodes or primary lung mass samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA were collected between May 2011 and May 2013. We consecutively analyzed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion genes using remnant tissue samples. Results A total of 109 patients were diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Of these, 70% were adenocarcinoma, 27% squamous cell carcinoma with NSCLC, and 3% were related to other types of lung cancer. EGFR mutations were detected in 23 cases (21.1%), KRAS mutations in 13 cases (11.9%), and ALK fusion genes in 5 cases (4.9%). The ALK fusion genes could not be analyzed in four cases because of insufficient tissue samples remaining after routine histochemistry and an EGFR/KRAS mutation analysis. We found that small biopsy samples from EBUS-TBNA were adequate for performing a triple gene analysis in 97 patients (96%). ALK fusion protein immunohistochemistry (IHC) was 100% consistent with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Conclusion Small samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA were found to be sufficient for performing a triple gene analysis following routine histology and IHC. ALK IHC showed a very good concordance with FISH for detecting ALK fusion genes.","title":"Triple Gene Analysis Using Samples Obtained by Endobronchial Ultrasound-guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration.","pubmedId":"27803402"}
