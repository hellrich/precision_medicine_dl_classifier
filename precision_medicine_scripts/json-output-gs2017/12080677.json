The positive percentage of cyclin D1, CDK4, p16 and Rb was 66.7%, 53.3%, 33.3%, and 36.7%, respectively. The overexpression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 could be observed frequently in low grade of differentiated cells, especially in marginal cells of the cancer nest. The results indicate that the aberrant expression of positive and negative regulators of the cell cycle may be involved in the carcinogenesis and evolution of SCC.","title":"[Study on regulators of the cell cycle in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma].","pubmedId":"12080677"}
