We evaluated 56 gastric GISTs for KIT and PDGFRA mutations. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, and exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 of the KIT gene and exons 12 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The genetic features were then compared with the clinicopathological features. Immunohistochemistry was performed for KIT, CD34, Ki-67 (as a marker of cell proliferation) and CD31 (as a marker of microvessel density), and apoptosis was assessed by in situ DNA nick-end labeling. Thirty-four (61%) of the 56 GISTs had a mutation in exon 11 of KIT, and 2 (4%) had a mutation in exon 13 of KIT. Deletions in exon 11 of KIT were the most common mutation encountered in the present study. No mutations were found in exon 9 or 17 of KIT. Six of the 20 GISTs lacking KIT mutations had a mutation in exon 18 of PDGFRA, and 1 had a mutation in exon 12 of PDGFRA. The KIT mutation-positive GISTs showed more frequent liver metastases and higher mortality than KIT mutation-negative GISTs. Our data indicate that KIT mutations, especially deletions in exon 11, are markers of poor prognosis for gastric GISTs.","title":"Deletion of the KIT gene is associated with liver metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor in the stomach.","pubmedId":"16685437"}
