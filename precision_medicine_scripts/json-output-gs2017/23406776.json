Expression of proteins and mRNAs was assessed by Western blotting and real-time PCR in 25 tumors. Cell lines Ben-Men-1 (benign), IOMM-Lee and KT21 (malignant), and pairs of merlin-positive or -negative meningioma cells were used to assess sensitivity toward mTORC1 inhibitors in methyl-tetrazolium and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) assays. The effect of temsirolimus (20 mg/kg daily) on tumor weight or MRI-estimated tumor volume was tested by treatment of eight nude mice (vs. 7 controls) carrying subcutaneous IOMM-Lee xenografts, or of eight (5) mice xenotransplanted intracranially with IOMM-Lee (KT21) cells in comparison to eight (5) untreated controls.\nAll components of the mTORC1 pathway were expressed and activated in meningiomas, independent of their WHO grade. A significant dosage-dependent growth inhibition by temsirolimus and everolimus was observed in all cell lines. It was slightly diminished by merlin loss. In the orthotopic and subcutaneous xenograft models, temsirolimus treatment resulted in about 70% growth reduction of tumors (P \u003c 0.01), which was paralleled by reduction of Ki67 mitotic index (P \u003c 0.05) and reduction of mTORC1 activity (p70S6K phosphorylation) within the tumors.\nmTORC1 inhibitors suppress meningioma growth in mouse models, although the present study did not measure survival.","title":"mTORC1 inhibitors suppress meningioma growth in mouse models.","pubmedId":"23406776"}
