Probably, hypercholesterolemia is also a risk factor for the development of hypertension. On the other side, it is also possible that lipid-lowering treatment could improve blood pressure control. Although the mechanisms of interaction between these two risk factors have not been completely elucidated thus far, there is rapidly growing evidence that the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can be considered as the common link between hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. In particular, hypercholesterolemia seems to promote the upregulation of type 1 angiotensin II (AT1) receptor genes because of an increase in the stability of mRNA followed by structural overexpression of vascular AT1 receptors for angiotensin II. The treatment of both risk factors greatly improves individual risk profile, especially when statins and RAS blockers are used together.\nHypertension and hypercholesterolemia are highly coprevalent and strongly related from a pathophysiological point of view. The RAS could be the main mediator of this link.","title":"Renin-angiotensin system at the crossroad of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.","pubmedId":"27745933"}
