In addition, when p21(WAF1) mRNA expression was undectectable or at very low level (50% less than that in adjacent tissue and normal colorectal mucosa) in all tissues, the level of acetylated histone H3 in colorectal cancerous tissue was significantly lower than that in corresponding para-cancerous tissue and normal colorectal mucosa in five of seven (71.43%) cases. The transcriptional level of p21(WAF1) in colorectal carcinoma might not be associated with its biological behaviors.\nThe down-regulation of p21(WAF1) transcription is involved in the tumorigenesis and development of colorectal carcinoma. The down-expression of p21(WAF1) mRNA in colorectal carcinoma might be associated with histone hypoacetylation in chromatin but not with biological behaviors.","title":"Expression of p21(WAF1) is related to acetylation of histone H3 in total chromatin in human colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"17465503"}
