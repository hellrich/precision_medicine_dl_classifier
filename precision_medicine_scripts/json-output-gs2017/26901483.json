To identify rational polytherapy strategies to improve clinical outcomes, we studied the molecular basis of ALK oncogene dependence in ALK gene rearrangement positive (ALK+) lung adenocarcinoma. We discovered that RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling is the crucial downstream pathway that is required for ALK+ tumor cell survival. Upfront co-inhibition of ALK and MEK improved response and blocked resistance in preclinical ALK+ lung cancer models, providing rationale for a new treatment paradigm for ALK+ patients.
