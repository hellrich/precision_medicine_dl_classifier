KML001 (sodium meta-arsenite) has demonstrated certain antitumor activity. The objective of the study was to evaluate the influence of KML001 on the anticancer activity of gemcitabine against pancreatic cancer cells.\nCell proliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed, as well as the expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGFC) in pancreatic cancer cells.\nTreatment with a combination of KML001 and gemcitabine resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and significantly reduced EGFR and MMP2 expression compared to gemcitabine treatment-alone.\nCombination treatment of gemcitabine and KML001 could be an effective chemotherapeutic treatment for pancreatic cancer.","title":"KML001 enhances anticancer activity of gemcitabine against pancreatic cancer cells.","pubmedId":"25550550"}
