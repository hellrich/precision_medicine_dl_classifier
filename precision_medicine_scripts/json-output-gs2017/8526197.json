Retinoid-IFN combinations have shown significant antitumor activity against advanced cutaneous and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and the toxic effects do not appear to overlap. Based on in vitro evidence of synergy and observed clinical activity, we conducted a pilot phase II trial of 13-cis-retinoic acid (1 mg/kg/day) and IFN alpha (6 million units/day) in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. No objective responses occurred among six evaluable patients. The toxicities were mild and reversible, and grade 3 fatigue occurred in only one patient. No objective antitumor activity was noted against pancreatic adenocarcinomas at the dose and schedule utilized. Further exploration of this this purely biological approach is not warranted for pancreatic adenocarcinomas.","title":"Pilot phase II trial of 13-cis-retinoic acid and interferon-alpha combination therapy for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"8526197"}
