Immunohistochemical analysis for KIT, DOG1, and PKC-θ is used for the diagnosis of GIST. Recently, ETV1 has been shown to be a lineage survival factor for ICCs and required for tumorigenesis of GIST. We investigated the diagnostic value of ETV1expression in GIST. On fresh-frozen tissue samples, RT-PCR analysis showed that ETV1 as well as KIT, DOG1, and PKC-θ are highly expressed in GISTs. On tissue microarrays containing 407 GISTs and 120 non-GIST mesenchymal tumors of GI tract, we performed RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) for ETV1 together with immunohistochemical analysis for KIT, DOG1, PKC-θ, CD133, and CD44. Overall, 387 (95 %) of GISTs were positive for ETV1, while KIT and DOG1 were positive in 381 (94 %) and 392 (96 %) cases, respectively, showing nearly identical overall sensitivity of ETV1, KIT, and DOG1 for GISTs. In addition, ETV1 expression was positively correlated with that of KIT. Notably, ETV1 was positive in 15 of 26 (58 %) KIT-negative GISTs and even positive in 2 cases of GIST negative for KIT and DOG1, whereas only 6 (5 %) non-GIST mesenchymal GI tumors expressed ETV1. We conclude that ETV1 is specifically expressed in the majority of GISTs, even in some KIT-negative cases, suggesting that ETV1 may be useful as ancillary marker in diagnostically difficult select cases of GIST.","title":"ETV1 mRNA is specifically expressed in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"26243012"}
