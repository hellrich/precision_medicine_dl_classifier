Cases with recurrent colorectal cancer or previous history of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis of factors thought to influence survival was then made using Logrank test. Criteria studied consisted of age, sex, TNM stage, T-status, nodal status, distant metastasis, histological grade, lymphatic and vascular invasion, tumour location, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level and liver function tests. Multivariate analysis was conducted using Cox regression analysis.\nThe mean survival time for all patients was 42.8 (SEM \u003d 2.8) months. The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 72%, 54% and 47%, respectively. In univariate analysis, patients\u0027 age (P \u003c 0.0001), TNM stage (P \u003c 0.0001), T-status (P \u003d 0.015), nodal status (P \u003d 0.016), distant metastasis (P \u003c 0.0001), grade (P \u003d 0.005), lymphatic and vascular invasion (P \u003c 0.0001) and presurgery CEA level \u003e 5 ng/ml (P \u003d 0.021) were found to be predictors that could affect survival. In Cox regression analysis, age (P \u003c 0.0001), TNM stage (P \u003d 0.001) and grade (P \u003d 0.008) were determined as independent prognostic factors of survival.\nAge, TNM stage, T-status, nodal status, distant metastasis, grade, lymphatic and vascular invasion and presurgery CEA level can predict the postsurgical survival rate in patients with colorectal cancer.","title":"Prognostic factors in survival of colorectal cancer patients after surgery.","pubmedId":"18462239"}
