As a new procedure to prevent postoperative hepatic failure in hilar cholangiocarcinoma infiltrating predominantly the right hepatic duct, we devised a combination of extended right lobectomy plus caudal lobectomy with resection of the left hepatic duct prior to hepatic resection by utilizing intraoperative cholangiography, and applied the procedure to a 70-year-old patient. He had a favorable postoperative course and remains recurrence-free at 4 years after operation. This is a procedure for confining the extent of hepatectomy to the minimum necessary, aiming at curative resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Extended right hepatectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma with resection of the left hepatic duct prior to hepatic resection.","pubmedId":"16353189"}
