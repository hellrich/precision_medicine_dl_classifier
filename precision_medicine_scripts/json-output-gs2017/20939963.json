Positive rate of telomerase activity in lung cancer tissues was 75 %. The level of telomerase activity in squmaous cell carcinomas was significantly higher than that in adenocarcinomas ( t \u003d 2. 235 , P \u003c 0. 05) . The positive rate of telomerase was 50 % in stage II lung cancer and 92. 3 % in stage III disease.\nTelomerase expression might be involved in the oncogenesis and progression of lung cancer and could be used as a tumor marker in the diagnosis of lung cancer.","title":"[Telomerase activity in human primary lung caner.].","pubmedId":"20939963"}
