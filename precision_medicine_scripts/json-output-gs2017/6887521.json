The average age of patients with gastric cancer in this area was somewhat higher compared with that of all gastric cancer patients. In early cancers of this area, the incidence of intestinal type carcinomas was more frequent than in patients with early cancers of the other area. However, in advanced cancer of this area, the incidence of diffuse type carcinoma was higher than in advanced cancers of the other area. The incidence of early cancer measuring more than 5 cm in diameter was 4.8% (15.5% for all early gastric cancers). The incidence of mucosal cancer was 33.8% (53% for all early gastric cancers).","title":"[Clinico-pathological study of gastric cancer in the greater curvature].","pubmedId":"6887521"}
