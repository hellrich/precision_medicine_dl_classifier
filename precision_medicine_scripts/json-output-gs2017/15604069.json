The surgical approaches included resections of the perihepatic cholangiocarcinoma, of the quadrate lobe and outer bile ductule carcinoma, of the left half of the liver, of the caudal lobe and outer bile ductule carcinoma, and Roux-en-Y ligation of the intraheptic bile ductule-jeajunum.\nResection is a the primary choice for treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and radical resection may prolong the patients\u0027 survival time and achieve better effect than simple drainage. In cases where resection is impossible, jaundice management should be carried out.","title":"[Surgical treatments for hilar cholangiocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"15604069"}
