Peripheral blood samples were collected from these 39 patients and 30 normal controls to examine the plasma MMPs and TIMP-1 by ELISA.\nTypical myocardial remodeling was seen in the myocardial tissues of the CHF patients. The plasma levels of MMP-2, -3, and -9 of the CHF patients in the cardiac function classes II - IV were all significantly higher than those of the normal controls (P \u003c 0.05 or P \u003c 0.01) with a tendency to increase with the deterioration of heart function, The plasma level of TIMP-1 of the CHF patients in the cardiac function classes II - IV were all significantly higher than that of the normal controls (P \u003c 0.05 or P \u003c 0.01) with a tendency to decrease with the deterioration of heart function. The protein expression levels of MMP-2, -3, and -9 in the myocardium of the CHF patients in the cardiac function classes III - IV were all significantly higher than those of the normal controls (P \u003c 0.05 or P \u003c 0.01) with a tendency to increase with the deterioration of heart function. The protein expression levels of TIMP-1 in the myocardium of the CHF patients in the cardiac function classes III - IV were all significantly lower than that of the normal controls (P \u003c 0.05 or P \u003c 0.01) with a tendency to decrease with the deterioration of heart function. The protein expression levels of FN in the myocardium of the CHF patients in the cardiac function classes II - IV were all significantly lower than that of the normal controls (all P \u003c 0.05) with a tendency to decrease with the deterioration of heart function. The protein expression levels of TN-C in the myocardium of the CHF patients in the cardiac function classes II - IV were all significantly higher than that of the normal controls (all P \u003c 0.01) with a tendency to increase with the deterioration of heart function.\nThe increasing expression of MMP-2, -3, and -9 and the decreasing expression of TIMP-1 contribute to the myocardial remodeling, thus changing the extracellular matrix in the myocardium tissue and leading to the development and progression of CHF.","title":"[Involvement of matrix metalloproteinases in the regulation of myocardial extracellular matrix in patients with congestive heart failure].","pubmedId":"16854324"}
