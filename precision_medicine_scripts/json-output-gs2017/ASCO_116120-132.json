Methods:    This retrospective study included 115 NA-NSCLC consecutive patients with available tumor tissue and survival data, median follow up period of 6.4 years. EGFR gene copy number and protein expression was evaluated using by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tissue microarray sections, respectively.  Results:    Among 115 patients, 99 patients (86.1 %) were with squamous cell carcinoma histology. EGFR gene amplification and high polysomy (EGFR FISH+) were observed in 57 (49.6%) and 45 (39.1%) patients, respectively. Patients with EGFR FISH+ had significantly shorter overall survival [median, 41 months vs. not reached (\u003e70 months), P \u003d 0.011]. Multivariable model confirmed that patients with EGFR FISH+ had a significantly greater risk of death than those with EGFR FISH-negative after adjusting pathologic staging, presence of pleural invasion, venous invasion and adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio \u003d 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.23-3.61, P \u003d 0.006). EGFR IHC expression did not associate with overall survival in same group.  Conclusions:  EGFR increased gene copy number is an independent negative prognostic factor in surgically resected NA-NSCLC.","title":"Prognostic value of epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification in surgically resected non-adenocarcinoma lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_116120-132"}
