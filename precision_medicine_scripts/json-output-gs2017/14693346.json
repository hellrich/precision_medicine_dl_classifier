In locally-advanced or refractory cervical cancer, cisplatin-based chemotherapy still represents the best chance of cure, although chemotherapy in these patients usually results in excessive toxicity and short duration of response. Newly developed chemotherapy agents, widely used in other cancers, have been employed as single agents and in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of locally advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. Several phase II-studies have been performed in order to assess the effectiveness of gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine and camptothecines in cervical cancer. When used as single agents, these compounds have an overall response rate (ORR) of 8-25%. Cisplatin-combined regimens may offer improved efficacy, with a ORR between 41 and 60%. Toxicity remains the more limiting factor in the treatment of irradiated or pretreated patients. New targets must be identified for innovative therapeutic approaches that could improve the response rate and survival of cervical cancer patients.","title":"New drugs in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"14693346"}
