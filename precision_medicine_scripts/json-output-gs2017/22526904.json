This is the first population-level analysis of the characteristics and outcomes of simultaneous MTC/DTC.\nIn the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1988-2008), patients with simultaneous MTC/DTC were retrospectively compared with those with MTC alone using Ï‡(2), ANOVA, log-rank tests, Cox multivariate regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses.\nA total of 162 patients had simultaneous MTC/DTC; 1,699 had MTC alone. MTC was diagnosed first in 67.9 % of simultaneous MTC/DTC cases. Simultaneous MTC/DTC increased from 2.7 % of all MTCs in 1988-1997 to 12.3 % in 2003-2008. Compared with MTC alone, simultaneous MTC/DTC had smaller mean MTC tumor size (2.9 vs. 2.2 cm; p \u003d 0.005) and lower rates of MTC extrathyroidal extension (25.4 vs. 16.8 %; p \u003d 0.015) and distant metastases (15.7 vs. 9.3 %; p \u003d 0.032). Patients diagnosed with DTC first had smaller mean MTC tumor sizes (p \u003d 0.01), whereas patients diagnosed with MTC first had tumor sizes similar to those of MTC alone. Compared with MTC alone, patients with simultaneous MTC/DTC were more likely to receive thyroidectomy (84.7 vs. 93.2 %; p \u003d 0.003) and radioisotopes (4.4 vs. 25 %; p \u003c 0.001). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, disease-specific survival rates were higher for simultaneous MTC/DTC than for MTC alone (10-year survival rates 87 vs. 81 %; p \u003d 0.056).\nSimultaneous MTC/DTC is diagnosed earlier in tumor development than MTC alone, with a trend toward better prognosis. This entity likely represents a primary tumor with an incidental pathologic finding of a second malignancy. Each malignancy should be treated according to its respective stage and current guidelines.","title":"Simultaneous medullary and differentiated thyroid cancer: a population-level analysis of an increasingly common entity.","pubmedId":"22526904"}
