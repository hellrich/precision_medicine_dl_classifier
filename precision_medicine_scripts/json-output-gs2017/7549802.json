Overall, liver cancer is the most frequent malignancy, but there are large regional differences in incidence and in histological type, with very high rates of cholangiocarcinoma in the northeast (associated with endemic opisthorchiasis) but a more even distribution of hepatocellular carcinoma. Lung cancer is second in frequency, with the highest rates in northern Thailand, where the incidence in women (Age Standardized Rate, 37.4 per 100,000) is among the highest in the world. A link with tobacco smoking is suggested by similarly raised rates, especially in women, for cancers of the larynx and pancreas. Cervical cancer is the most common malignancy in women, with relatively little regional variation in risk, while the incidence of breast cancer is low. Other cancer sites showing moderately increased rates include the lip and oral cavity, particularly in females from the north and northeast, where the chewing of betel nut remains common among older generations, nasopharyngeal cancer, carcinoma of the esophagus in the southern region, and penile cancer, especially in the north and northeast. Previous studies which have investigated the etiological factors underlying these patterns are reviewed, and the implications for future research and for national cancer control policies are discussed.","title":"Cancer incidence in Thailand, 1988-1991.","pubmedId":"7549802"}
