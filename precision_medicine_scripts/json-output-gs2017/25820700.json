Thus far, there is nevertheless little study about these two molecules in lung adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between β-arrestin1 and NF-κB expression and the clinicopathological characteristics in lung adenocarcinoma. A total of 115 surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma patients were recruited for the study. Expression of β-arrestin1 and p65 were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples. Nuclear expression of β-arrestin1 and p65 were observed in 39.1 % (45/115) and 46.1 % (53/115) cases of lung adenocarcinoma, respectively. And high expression of β-arrestin1 had negative prognostic impact for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (p \u003d 0.034 and p \u003d 0.033). In addition, overexpression of p65 indicated a significantly poor OS and DFS than those of lower-expression (p \u003d 0.038 and p \u003d 0.041). Furthermore, co-expression of nuclear β-arrestin1 and p65 correlated with poorer OS and DFS in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model confirmed that co-expression of nuclear β-arrestin1 and p65 was an independent prognostic factor for tumor progression (p \u003d 0.008). In conclusion, these data indicated that co-expression of nuclear β-arrestin1 and p65 was a novel predictor for worse prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Co-expression of β-arrestin1 and NF-кB is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25820700"}
