Preoperative endoscopic and X-ray examinations showed a spherical submucosal tumor in the gastric fornix. We resected the tumor by laparoscopic surgery, because it was detected by computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET), and they did not detect distant metastasis. Postoperative histologic examination revealed that the tumor was composed of spindle-shaped cells with elongated nuclei and showed little mitosis. Almost all of the cells showed immunoreactivity for c-kit, CD34, vimentin and but did not show alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), S-100, or desmin. The Ki-67 labeling index was 0.8%. The tumor did not show differentiation toward smooth muscle or neural cells. Pathological findings showed this tumor was probably benign. In such cases, careful follow-up is needed to detect liver metastasis and local recurrence.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach: report of a case.","pubmedId":"16001681"}
