However, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs has been identified as an important clinical problem. Transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rare mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy. We describe the case of a 61-year-old man who presented transformation from adenocarcinoma to SCLC as the manifestation of acquired resistance after EGFR-TKI treatment. He underwent chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin and achieved a complete response.
