Although many treatments have been conducted for peritoneal dissemination, no standard chemotherapy has yet been established. For sometime we had used continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP)for peritoneal dissemination in gastric cancer and colon cancer. CHPP has a marked survival benefit for scirrhous type gastric cancer patients without liver metastasis. Patients with prophylactic CHPP have significantly better prognoses than those without prophylactic CHPP, and therapeutic CHPP has a survival benefit for gastric cancer patients with slight to moderate peritoneal dissemination (P 1-2). But CHPP has no significant prognostic benefit for gastric cancer patients with severe peritoneal dissemination (P 3). Therefore, a new cancer treatment is needed for those patients. On the other hand, many kinds of anticancer agents, including cisplatin, via intraperitoneal (ip) administration have been tried thus far for peritoneal dissemination therapy. Especially, intraperitoneal taxane anticancer agent is very effective for the treatment and local control of severe peritoneal dissemination in gastric cancer. A phase I/II study of taxane anticancer agents via ip administration should be tried in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal dissemination.","title":"[Intraperitoneal chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal dissemination].","pubmedId":"16227738"}
