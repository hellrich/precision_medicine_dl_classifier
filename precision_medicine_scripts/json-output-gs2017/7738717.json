Published studies have included few cases of Ewing\u0027s sarcoma (ES) or peripheral neuroectodermal tumour (PNET), a tumour group in which alterations of the p53 pathway have so far not been extensively studied. We examined two ES cell lines, RD-ES and SK-ES-1, and 30 specimens from 27 patients (24 ES, 6 PNET; 19 primary, 4 local recurrence, 7 metastasis) for MDM2 gene amplification by Southern blot analysis. All 30 clinical specimens had been confirmed to contain sufficient ES/PNET DNA by the demonstration of a rearrangement of the t(11;22)-associated EWS gene using an EWS cDNA probe on the same blots. MDM2 gene amplification was detected in 3 of 30 specimens (10 per cent), including two ES and one PNET, but in neither of the cell lines. The three cases with amplification were morphologically typical primary tumours. Two of the three cases also showed co-amplification of the CDK4 gene, which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase and also maps to band 12q13. Clinically, all three cases had metastatic disease at diagnosis, compared with only 1 of 15 MDM2-negative cases where the primary tumour was studied. The difference was statistically significant (P \u003d 0.005), suggesting an association of MDM2 amplification with advanced stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"MDM2 and CDK4 gene amplification in Ewing\u0027s sarcoma.","pubmedId":"7738717"}
