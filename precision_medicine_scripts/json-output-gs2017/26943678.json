Here, we aimed to report a case with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.\nA 54-year-old woman presented with weight loss, jaundice, and pain in the epigastric and right upper quadrant of the abdomen. With extensive radiological imaging, the patient was diagnosed with periampullary tumor and Whipple\u0027s procedure was performed. The immunohistochemical analyses supported the diagnosis of primary squamous cell carcinoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged, and adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended.\nPrimary squamous cell carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is a very rare histological type with an unclear pathogenesis. A better understanding of pathogenesis might be helpful in optimizing the treatment for this specific rare type of tumor.","title":"Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater: a case report.","pubmedId":"26943678"}
