Treatment is currently focused on individualization according to the molecular profile of the disease. Here we present the case of a 41-year-old patient who presented with multiple pulmonary nodules, a left pleural effusion and an ovarian tumor. Adenocarcinoma of the lung was diagnosed from pathological examination of the pleural effusion and the surgically resected ovarian tumor, and chemotherapy was initiated. Relapse was experienced following third-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive adenocarcinoma was diagnosed using a specimen from the resected ovarian tumor. Subsequently, crizotinib therapy was initiated. Eight days later the patient developed severe nausea and vomiting and esophagitis was diagnosed by gastrointestinal endoscopic examination. Following the interruption of crizotinib treatment by treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), crizotinib treatment was re-initiated and was effective for a minimum of 6 months. Clinicians should be aware that treatment with crizotinib may result in severe esophagitis.","title":"Esophagitis resulting from treatment with crizotinib for anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement-positive lung adenocarcinoma: A case report.","pubmedId":"24649319"}
