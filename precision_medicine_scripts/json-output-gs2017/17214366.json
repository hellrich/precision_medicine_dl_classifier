Clinicopathological variables included age, gender, body location, degree of dedifferentiation and mitotic count. The rrolecular analysis included MDM2, CDK4 and TP53 expressions and chromosome-12 copy number alterations.\nCentrally located (retroperitoneal, abdominal cavity or groin region) WDLPS had more dedifferentiation (p\u003d0.001). Patients with DDLPS and a high mitotic rate died (p\u003d0.070) or experienced recurrencies (p\u003d0.029) more frequently. Co-expression of MDM2/CDK4 (p\u003d0.001) and TP53 accumulation (p\u003d0.017) related to dedifferentiation but not to recurrence or death, both in WDLPS and DDLPS. DDLPS had higher centromeric chromosome-12 copy number than WDLPS (p\u003d0.013), but this was unrelated to recurrence or death.\nCentral location is a risk factor in WDLP. Co-expression of MDM2/CDK4/TP53 and chromosome-12 alterations characterize DDLPS suggesting a link with dedifferentiation.","title":"Chromosome-12 copy number alterations and MDM2, CDK4 and TP53 expression in soft tissue liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"17214366"}
