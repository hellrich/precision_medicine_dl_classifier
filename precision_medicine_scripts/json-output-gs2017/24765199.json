However, it remains unclear whether CDK4, CDK6 or both are required for RB phosphorylation in colorectal carcinoma and thus PD-0332991 can be used to target this CDK-RB axis for the cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether CDK4, CDK6 and phosphorylated RB proteins were overexpressed in colorectal carcinoma tissues as compared to matched normal colorectal tissues. The results showed that knockdown of CDK6 but not CDK4 reduced RB phosphorylation and inhibited carcinoma cell growth. Thus, CDK6 plays a critical role in RB phosphorylation and cancer growth. PD-0332991 treatment blocked RB phosphorylation and inhibited cell growth through the induction of G1 arrest of colorectal carcinoma cells. The results demonstrated that, by targeting of CDK6-RB axis, PD-0332991 may prove to be a novel therapeutic agent in treating colorectal carcinoma.","title":"PD-0332991 induces G1 arrest of colorectal carcinoma cells through inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase-6 and retinoblastoma protein axis.","pubmedId":"24765199"}
