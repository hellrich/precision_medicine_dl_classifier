However, their prognostic and predictive impact remains unclear.  Methods:  Search for IDH1 mutation by mIDH1 R132H immunohistochemistry (IHC) and by DNA sequencing were performed in a series of 43 WHO grade 3 oligodendrogliomas. IHC was performed with mouse monoclonal mIDH1 R132H (gift von Dr von Deimling, Heidelberg, Germany). DNA was extracted from FFPE sections following macrodissection using an iPrep system. A fragment of exon 4 (122 bp) spanning the sequence encoding the catalytic domain of IDH1 including codon 132 was amplified and sequenced using standard conditions. The impact of IDH1 mutations on progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed.  Results:    Mean age at diagnosis was 51 years, ratio male/female (28/15) and Karnovsky Performans Status (KPS): [\u003c70] n\u003d3, [70-100] n\u003d40. Diagnosis was obtained by surgical biopsy (n\u003d13, 30%), suboptimal resection (n\u003d20, 47%) and optimal resection (n\u003d10, 23%). IDH1 R132H mutation was identified by IHC in 20/43 (47%) patients and R132G mutation by DNA sequencing in 2 (9%)  of the 23 remaining patients. Finally, IDH1 mutation was identified in 22/43 (51%) patients. First-line treatments following surgery were chemotherapy alone (n\u003d5), radiotherapy alone (n\u003d5) and sequential or concomitant radio-chemotherapy (n\u003d33) according to PCV regimen (n\u003d29) or Stupp regimen (n\u003d4). With a median follow up of 19 months (range 1.4-128), median PFS and OS were 22 and 35 months. IDH1 mutation was statistically associated with prolonged PFS and OS in univariate analysis: 1-year PFS rate 100% vs 31%, 3-years PFS rate 86% vs 6%, 1-year OS rate 100% vs 46% and 3-years OS 92% vs 9%  for IDH1 mutated patients versus wild type respectively. Median OS was 108 vs 12 months (p\u003d0.00002, Hazard Ratio 0.1 IC95 0-0.3) for IDH1 mutated patients vs wild type respectively.  Conclusions:  In this treated group of grade 3 oligodendrogliomas, the presence of IDH1 mutation assessed by IHC and DNA sequencing  is found to carry a very strong predictive impact on PFS and OS.","title":"Predictive value of IDH1 mutation assessed by immunohistochemistry and DNA sequencing in WHO grade 3 oligodendrogliomas.","pubmedId":"ASCO_81985-102"}
