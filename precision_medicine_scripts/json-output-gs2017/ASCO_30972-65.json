Gemcitabine (G) and cisplatin (C) are now deemed as key drugs based on the accumulated literature. This is the first study to compare GC combination with G alone in Japan, even though one phase 3 trial (ABC-02) is ongoing in UK. Methods: 84 Japanese pts, aged  20 years, with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced BTC, Performance Status 0 - 1, with adequate bone-marrow, hepatic and renal function were randomized. 83 pts received either C 25 mg/m2 plus G 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, and 8 of each 21-day cycle (GC-arm) or G 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (G-arm). Treatments were repeated up to a maximum of 16 cycles of GC or 12 of G until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Tumor response was evaluated using RECIST criteria by an independent review committee. The primary end-point of the study was 1- year survival rate. Safety, response rate, duration of progression-free survival were also evaluated. Results: A total of 83 pts (19 extrahepatic bile duct cancer, 28 intrahepatic bile duct cancer, 32 gallbladder cancer and 4 ampullary carcinoma) were eligible for the study protocol defined analysis set (Full Analysis Set, FAS); GC-arm n\u003d41 and G-arm n\u003d42. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two arms: median ages were 65.0 vs 66.5, females were 56.1 vs 50.0%. All pts completed at least one cycle of therapy, yielding a total of 247 cycles (median 6) in GC vs 203 (median 4) in G. The overall response rates were 19.5% (95% CI: 8.8, 34.9) vs 11.9 (95% CI: 4.0, 25.6). The results on survival will be determined and presented at the meeting. The most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 toxicities were: neutropenia (56.1 vs 38.1%), thrombocytopenia (39.0 vs 7.1%), leukopenia (29.3 vs 19.0%), hemoglobin decrease (36.6 vs 16.7%) and -GTP increase (29.3 vs 35.7%). Grade 3 acute renal failure was reported in 1 pt on GC. Conclusions: The combination therapy of GC would be an effective and well-tolerated chemotherapy regimen for Japanese pts with advanced BTC.","title":"A randomized study of gemcitabine/cisplatin versus single-agent gemcitabine in patients with biliary tract cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_30972-65"}
