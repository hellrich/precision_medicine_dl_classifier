Obesity is the main cause of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, and cancer. The purpose of the study was to examine obesity, body image, depression, and weight-control behaviour among Korean female university students and investigate the differences in body image, depression, and weight-control behaviour with respect to obesity.\nThis study examined obesity, body image, depression, and weight control in 700 female university students from 4 universities in South Korea. To evaluate obesity, both objective obesity (body mass index [BMI]) and subjective obesity (subjectively perceived) were measured.\nThere was a significant difference between objective and subjective obesity (Ï‡(2) \u003d 231.280, P \u003c 0.001). In addition, the objective obesity group had the lowest body image score (F \u003d 19.867, P \u003c 0.001) and difference in weight-control behaviour (F \u003d 3.145, P \u003d 0.045). Further, the subjective obesity group had the lowest body image score (F \u003d 58.281, P \u003c 0.001). The results revealed a statistically significant difference in body image and weight-control behaviour with respect to objective obesity.\nObjective and subjective obesity was negatively associated with body image, and no relationships between objective or subjective obesity and depression.","title":"Obesity, Body Image, Depression, and Weight-control Behaviour Among Female University Students in Korea.","pubmedId":"25337594"}
