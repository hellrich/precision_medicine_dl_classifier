Metastases in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are rare and especially involve the stomach rather than the colon. Clinical or radiological features usually cannot differentiate them from a primary colorectal tumor, resulting in inappropriate treatment. In some cases, this lesion suggests multifocal spread of breast cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Colorectal breast cancer metastasis is a rare finding and there is no consensus on the management of these lesions. The present case report describes a 69-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting as an obstructive tumor of the transverse colon.","title":"Colorectal breast carcinoma metastasis diagnosed as an obstructive colonic primary tumor.
