Pancreatic epithelial tumors may be separated into ductal and nonductal neoplasms. The former group includes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor, mucinous cystic tumor and serous cystic tumor. The latter group includes pancreatic endocrine tumor, pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, pancreatoblastoma and solid-pseudopapillary tumor. The aim of this review is to summarize recently acquired knowledge regarding the molecular characterization of these uncommon pancreatic epithelial neoplasms.\nMolecular studies of uncommon pancreatic epithelial tumors suggest that the different morphological entities are associated with distinct molecular profiles, highlighting the involvement of different molecular pathways leading to the development of each subtype of pancreatic neoplasm.\nThe correct classification of rare pancreatic epithelial tumors and the identification of their characteristic molecular aspects is the fundamental starting point in identifying novel diagnostic molecular tools and new targets for innovative therapeutic strategies.","title":"Update on the molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic tumors other than common ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"19077452"}
