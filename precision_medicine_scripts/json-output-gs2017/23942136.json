{"genes":["tyrosine kinase"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"The understanding of aberrant molecular pathways that result in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and the rapid development of molecular therapies that target these pathways represent one of the great milestones in translational oncology. The story of GIST is unique in that targeted molecular therapy was successfully applied in clinical therapeutics, with dramatic results redefining the management of these traditionally chemotherapy-resistant tumors. We briefly review the molecular biology and clinical presentation of GIST and then discuss the adjuvant and neoadjuvant use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in early-stage GIST and their use in metastatic disease. Newer therapeutic advances in the rapidly changing field of GIST management are also discussed. ","title":"Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors: A Review.","pubmedId":"23942136"}
