Due to its multisystem nature, the management of NF2 requires a multidisciplinary approach. In England, the delivery of care for NF2 patients has been centralized to four-\"hub\" centres in Manchester, Cambridge, Oxford and London each having associated \"spoke\" centres. Each centre has a core multidisciplinary team consisting of genetics, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, paediatrics, neurology, audiology, radiology, psychology, physiotherapy, specialist nurses and administrative staff. In addition, the core team has access to plastic surgery, ophthalmology, peripheral nerve surgery and adult and paediatric oncology. There are weekly multidisciplinary clinics each with six to eight patients. Each patient is discussed during a team meeting and the management decisions that are made are then discussed with the patients. All patients are reviewed at least annually and have annual head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three yearly spinal MRI. Annual audiological assessment is performed. Cochlear implantation and auditory brainstem implantation are offered if indicated. Surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery and bevacizumab therapy are available for the management of intracranial and spinal tumours. The integration of the service in England has provided significant benefits to patient care and, in the long term, will provide robust patient outcome data that will provide an evidence base to assist in optimizing management of patients with NF2.","title":"Neurofibromatosis type 2 service delivery in England.","pubmedId":"26826883"}
