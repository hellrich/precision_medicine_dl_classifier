We recently identified amplification of RICTOR, a key component of the mTORC2 complex, as a new and sole genomic alteration in an 18-year-old never smoker with lung adenocarcinoma. We hypothesizethat RICTOR amplification, unlike previously reported molecular changes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, may identify a new subgroup of lung cancer patients amenable to molecularly targeted therapy.  Methods:    The index patient had RICTOR amplification identified by next generation sequencing (NGS)- genomic profiling of 182 cancer-related genes performed with extracted DNA from FFPE specimens. We then reviewed the database of 1128 lung cancer patients who had profiling performed by Foundation Medicine. Additionally, we examined the in vitro cytotoxicity of 6 classes of drugs against different components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in RICTOR-amplified H23 lung cancer cells.  Results:  RICTOR amplification in the index case was confirmed by FISH and IHC of RICTOR and its downstream targets. RICTOR amplification was found in 8.2% (92/1128) lung cancer patients from the NGS database. In 11% (10/92) of cases, RICTOR amplification was the only potentially actionable target. Additionally, 13% (12/92) and 27% (25/92) of these patients had concomitant alterations in KRAS and EGFR, exclusively in lung adenocarcinomas. One third of the patients (29/92) had alterations in other genes within the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Among all the examined agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, BEZ235 (dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and AZD2014 (dual mTOR1/2 inhibitor) were the most active in RICTOR-amplified H23 lung cancer cells. As a proof of concept, our index patient has been treated on a phase I clinical trial with a dual mTOR1/2 inhibitor (CC223) and has had stable disease for over 8 months.    Conclusions:  RICTOR amplification may define a novel and unique molecular subset of lung cancer patients. Our observation provides the rationale for testing RICTOR amplification as a potential biomarker for targeted therapy with mTOR1/2 inhibitors in lung cancer patients.","title":"Rictor amplification to define a novel and unique subset of lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_132992-144"}
