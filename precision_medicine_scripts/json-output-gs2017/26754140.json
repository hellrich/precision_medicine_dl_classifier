However, manifestation of the surgical plane during laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision versus in computed tomography images remains to be examined.\nPatients who underwent laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision for right-sided colon cancer underwent an abdominal computed tomography scan. The spatial relationship of the intraoperative surgical planes were examined, and then computed tomography reconstruction methods were applied. The resulting images were analyzed.\nIn 44 right-sided colon cancer patients, the surgical plane for laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision was found to be composed of three surgical planes that were identified by computed tomography imaging with cross-sectional multiplanar reconstruction, maximum intensity projection, and volume reconstruction. For the operations performed, the mean bleeding volume was 73±32.3 ml and the mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 22±9.7. The follow-up period ranged from 6-40 months (mean 21.2), and only two patients had distant metastases.\nThe laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision surgical plane for right-sided colon cancer is composed of three surgical planes. When these surgical planes were identified, laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision was a safe and effective procedure for the resection of colon cancer.","title":"Three surgical planes identified in laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision for right-sided colon cancer.","pubmedId":"26754140"}
