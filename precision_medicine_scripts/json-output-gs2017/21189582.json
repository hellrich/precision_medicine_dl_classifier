The expression of PTEN mRNA in left ventricle was detected by RT-PCR in different groups in 4 weeks after operation.\n(1) Compared with control group, the expression of PTEN mRNA in left ventricle of hypertrophy group was reduced. (2) Compared with hypertrophy group, the expression of PTEN mRNA in left ventricle of captopril group was upregulated, which were similar to that of control group.\nPTEN maybe plays a negative regulation role in the process of cardiac hypertrophy, and the role of PTEN is closely relative with renin-angiotensin system.","title":"[A study of the effect of PTEN on cardiac hypertrophy].","pubmedId":"21189582"}
