In the 153 patients with stage I-IIIa disease who had received no therapy prior to surgery and who were treated with curative intent, 11q13 amplification was associated with the presence of lymph node metastases (P less than 0.002). The presence of an 11q13 amplification was associated with a significantly shorter relapse-free survival (P less than 0.002) and a higher breast cancer-specific mortality (P less than 0.003). Stepwise multivariate analysis showed that, in addition to lymph node status, 11q13 amplification was the best predictor for short survival. Stratified log-rank analysis indicated that, within the group of lymph node-positive breast cancer patients, 11q13 amplification identifies a subgroup at high risk.","title":"Amplification of genes within the chromosome 11q13 region is indicative of poor prognosis in patients with operable breast cancer.","pubmedId":"1394126"}
