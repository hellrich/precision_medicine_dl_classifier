All patients had in common prominent neuropathic pain, massive weight loss, and multiple nutritional deficiencies. The pathophysiology of postbariatric surgery polyneuropathies is complex and involves nutritional, infectious and dysimmune mechanisms.\nThe spectrum of peripheral neuropathies complicating bariatric surgery is wide, and includes pure small fiber neuropathy, axonal polyneuropathy, and demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. Treatment is mainly preventive, but sometimes surgical revision is needed.","title":"[Peripheral neuropathies after bariatric surgery].","pubmedId":"21514611"}
