BRAF mutations, usually V600E, have been reported in 40%-70% of cases, and recently, MAP2K1 mutations have been reported in BRAF-negative cases. We assessed 50 cases of LCH for BRAF mutations and assessed a subset of cases for MAP2K1 mutations. The study group included 28 men and 22 women (median age, 36.5 years; range, 1-78 years). BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 8 (16%) cases including 3 (30%) skin, 2 (11%) bone, 1 (50%) colon, 1 (20%) lung, and 1 (33%) extradural, intracranial mass. MAP2K1 mutations were detected in 6 of 13 (46%) BRAF-negative cases including 2 (100%) lymph node, 2 (50%) bone, 1 (25%) skin, and 1 (100%) orbit. Patients with BRAF mutation were younger than patients with wild-type BRAF (median age, 28 versus 38 years; P \u003d .026). The median age of MAP2K1-mutated patients was 34.5 years, similar to patients without MAP2K1 mutation (41 years; P \u003d .368). In agreement with 2 recent studies, we showed a high frequency of MAP2K1 mutations in BRAF-negative LCH cases. Unlike other studies, the overall frequency of BRAF mutation in this cohort is substantially lower than what has been reported in pediatric patients, perhaps because most patients in this study were adults. Moreover, we showed a high concordance between mutational and immunohistochemical analysis for BRAF mutation. There was no statistically significant association between BRAF or MAP2K1 mutation and anatomic site, unifocal versus multifocal presentation, or clinical outcome.
