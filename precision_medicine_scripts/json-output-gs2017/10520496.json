This retrospective study concerned patients treated between 1974 and 1990 for papillary or follicular thyroid cancer. Our patients had at least one LR. LR diagnosed within 6 months after thyroidectomy and patients with increased serum thyroglobulin levels were excluded. Thirty one patients (80% female) aged 15 to 84 years had at least one LR. LR was diagnosed 7 to 200 months after thyroidectomy (mean 63.7). There were 25 papillary and 6 follicular cancers. There were 1.5 LR per patient (range 1-6). LR were treated by radioiodine in 21 cases and by surgery in 22 cases. Among the 22 surgically treated patients, 7 had nodal recurrences, 7 had nodes and tumor, 3 had only tumor, 1 had recurrence in the remnant thyroid. After a mean follow-up of 75.8 months, 11 patients had distant metastases, 11 had died from their thyroid carcinoma (7 after metastases). Three of the 7 patients with nodal recurrence died. In one third of cases, LR announced distant metastases. Node recurrence had a poor prognosis.","title":"[Outcome in cervical recurrences of papillary or follicular thyroid cancer].","pubmedId":"10520496"}
