The number of cases with the 2 primary carcinoma foci both located in the entero-intestinal duct, stomach and large intestine, was 23, more than that of the cases with their 2 carcinoma foci located in stomach or large intestine and other organs respectively (n \u003d 12). The 3-year survival rate of the large intestine-large intestine group was higher than that of the stomach-stomach group.\nEarly diagnosis, correct distinguishing of the primary and metastatic cancer play an important role in the treatment of synchronous double primary cancer and improvement of the prognosis.","title":"[Clinical and pathological features of synchronous double primary cancer in stomach and large intestine].","pubmedId":"18361811"}
