ADC of breast cancer was calculated using two b factors (0 and 1000 s mm(-2)). Mean ADCs of IDC NOS and DCIS were compared and evaluated. Among cases of IDC NOS, mean ADCs were compared with lymph node status, size and immunochemical prognostic factors using Student\u0027s t-test. ADC was also correlated with histological grade using the Kruskal-Wallis test.\nMean ADC of IDC NOS was significantly lower than that of DCIS (p\u003c0.001). However, the mean ADC of histological grade of IDC NOS was not significantly different (p\u003d0.564). Mean ADC of oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive cancer was significantly lower than that of ER-negative or PR-negative cancer (p\u003d0.003 vs p\u003d0.032). Mean ADC of Ki-67 index-positive cancer was significantly lower than that of Ki-67 index-negative cancer (p\u003d0.028). Mean ADC values of cancers with increased microvascular density (MVD) were significantly lower than those of cancer with no MVD increase (p\u003d0.009). No correlations were observed between mean ADC value and human growth factor receptor 2 expression, tumour size and lymph node metastasis.\nLow ADC value was correlated with positive expression of ER, PR, increased Ki-67 index, and increased MVD of breast cancer.","title":"Correlation of the apparent diffusion coefficiency values on diffusion-weighted imaging with prognostic factors for breast cancer.","pubmedId":"22128125"}
