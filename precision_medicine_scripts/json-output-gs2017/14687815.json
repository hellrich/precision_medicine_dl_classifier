Despite the high functional reserve of the pancreas, it is recognized that a significant proportion of diabetic patients may also have a deficit of the exocrine function. The aim of this study was to screen patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.\nA total of 80 patients were enrolled in this prospective study, including 42 patients with DM and 38 nondiabetic controls. Exclusion criteria were as follows: age \u003e75 yr; alcohol intake \u003e40 g/day; intake of orlistat or acarbose; and history of diarrhea, pancreatitis, GI surgery, immunodeficiency, or cancer. All patients underwent the same study protocol, which included clinical evaluation, determination of fecal E1, plain x-rays of the abdomen, and abdominal ultrasound. An immunoenzymatic method (ScheBoTech, Wettenburg, Germany) was used for E1 determination. Diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency was established for a fecal E1 \u003c200 microg/g.\nThe DM and control groups were comparable regarding age (62 +/- 10 yr vs 56 +/- 10 yr), sex (18 men and 24 women vs 15 men and 23 women), and proportion of patients with excess weight (50% vs 42%). Patients had DM diagnosed for 11.5 +/- 8 yr, with structural changes of the pancreas detected on ultrasound in three cases and calcifications in one case. There was no relationship between E1 determination \u003c200 microg/g and the duration or the type of therapy for DM. Fifteen patients (36%) in the DM group had a fecal E1 \u003c200 microg/g, compared with two patients (5%) in the control group (p \u003c 0.05). In the DM group (n \u003d 42), 11 patients with excess weight presented a fecal E1 \u003c200 microg/g, whereas four patients with a BMI \u003c25 presented this result (p \u003c 0.05).\nPancreatic exocrine insufficiency occurs more frequently in diabetic patients than in controls. Diabetic individuals with excess weight (BMI \u003e25) may be at increased risk for underlying exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.","title":"Screening for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in patients with diabetes mellitus.","pubmedId":"14687815"}
