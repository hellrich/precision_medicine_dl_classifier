Some specimens were examined by Southern blot hybridisation. The results showed varying degrees of amplification: c-myc 54.5%, N-ras 64.1% and c-erb B 31.8%, in the 22 cases of ovarian malignancies. All were significantly higher than in the three benign tumours and in normal ovarian tissue. Frequency of amplification of more than 2 oncogencis at the same time was found to be 40.9%. There was a negative correlation between amplification of c-myc and differentiation. A relatively high amplification of N-ras was present in late stage ovarian cancer. Patients with c-erb B amplification showed a shorter survival period than those without amplification.","title":"[The amplification of c-myc, N-ras, c-erb B oncogenes in ovarian malignancies].","pubmedId":"8287725"}
