The ratio of reduced/oxidised form of glutathione (GSH/GSSG) is an indicator of the redox status in cells. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of panitumumab on the redox status of colon cancer cell lines Caco-2, DLD-1 and HT-29 regarding proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, cell cycle arrest and autophagy. Methods: Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis and necrosis were detected by annexin v/propidium iodide assay. Cell cycle arrest was estimated by propidium iodide assay. Autophagy was detected by immunobloting and GSH levels were measured by spectrophotometrical analysis. kras mutations were detected by sequencing analysis. Results: Caco-2, DLD-1 and HT-29 cell lines differ in the expression levels of EGFR and HER-2. Kras mutation analysis in previous studies and in the current study showed that DLD-1 cells express mutated kras while Caco-2 and HT-29 cells express wild type of kras. Panitumumab decreased proliferation only in DLD-1 cells 48 h after its application besides the mutated kras. However, panitumumab did not affect DLD-1 cell apoptosis, necrosis or cell cycle progression 24 and 48 h after cells treatment. Interestingly, panitumumab increased protein levels of beclin 1, an indicator of autophagy, 24 h after its addition in cells. Moreover, an increase in GSH levels was noted 48 h after cells treatment with panitumumab. Conclusions: This is the first study to show that panitumumab, an EGFR inhibitor, affects colon cancer cell proliferation independently of kras mutations and EGFR protein levels through the induction of autophagy. The inhibition in cell proliferation was followed by an increase in GSH levels reflecting an imbalance on the redox status of cells.","title":"Effect of panitumumab on autophagy in colon cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_32653-65"}
