Employing the Kaplan-Meier method, the cumulative survival rates of the ampullary carcinoma were calculated. By Cox regression model, a stepwise multivariate analysis was performed to analyze the contributing factors of the survival rate, and a predictive survival equation was obtained.\nWith the results of the univariate analysis, the variables significantly associated with favorable prognosis were younger age (\u003c63 years), TNM stage (stage I or II or III), and the degree of tumor differentiation (well or moderately differentiated). When the above three variables were examined as covariates by Cox regression in multivariate analysis, the TNM stage and the degree of tumor differentiation were independently correlated with the survival. A predictive survival equation obtained with the beta-coefficients of the above three variables was as follows: S (t) \u003d [So (t)] P, P \u003d exp (0.0234 x age - 1.8744 x tumor differentiation + 1.1576 x TNM stage)\nThis predictive survival equation can predict the survival and the favorable outcome of patients treated with radical resection of ampullary carcinoma.","title":"A survival predictive model in patients undergoing radical resection of ampullary adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"15362785"}
