Various imaging studies showed a solid tumor (4cm in diameter) in the tail of the pancreas, multiple hypovascular tumors in liver. Serum levels of DUPAN2, SPAN1 and NSE were elevated slightly. Biopsy of hepatic tumor demonstrated that tumor cells had eosinophilic cytoplasm generally and unevenly distributed polymorphic nucleus. These data suggested that this tumor is poorly differentiated pancreatic carcinoma originated from the epithelium. Therefore, we administered 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, combined with gemcitabine. The clinical status improved temporarily by the treatment, however, worsened rapidly. He died 81days after the treatment. Final diagnosis of autopsy was pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the young patients is rare, and we reported this case in addition to consideration on literature.","title":"[A case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with rapid progress in a young man].","pubmedId":"16506669"}
