The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of postoperative anxiety and depression after surgical treatment for lung cancer, and to assess the risk factors associated with these phenomena.\nPatients who underwent curative surgical resection for primary lung cancer were included in this study. Patients with complex treatment histories (recurrent or metastatic lung cancer or neoadjuvant treatment) and those taking psychiatric medication were excluded. We prospectively evaluated the degrees of pre- and postoperative anxiety and depression using a Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale questionnaire. The relationships between clinical and patient factors and anxiety and depression after surgical treatment for lung cancer were assessed.\nA total of 278 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 62 years. Thoracoscopic resection was performed in 246 patients (89%). The prevalence rates of preoperative anxiety and depression were 8% (n \u003d 22) and 12% (n \u003d 32), and changed to 9% (n \u003d 26) and 19% (n \u003d 54) postoperatively (P \u003d 0.37 and \u003c0.001, respectively). Gender, age, marital status, advanced clinical stage, alcohol abuse, smoking status, length of hospital stay, pulmonary function and preoperative comorbidities were not associated with postoperative anxiety and depression. Multivariate analysis revealed that thoracotomy was a risk factor for postoperative anxiety after adjusting for preoperative anxiety (odds ratio [OR] \u003d 4.5, P \u003d 0.002). Thoracotomy (OR \u003d 3.4, P \u003d 0.009), postoperative dyspnoea (OR \u003d 4.8, P \u003c 0.001), severe pain (OR \u003d 3.9, P \u003d 0.001) and diabetes mellitus (OR \u003d 3.0, P \u003d 0.012) were identified as risk factors for postoperative depression after adjusting for preoperative depression. Twenty-four patients were referred to mental health professionals and provided with supportive psychotherapy or pharmacological intervention. Of these, 14 patients (56%) were diagnosed with an adjustment disorder.\nPostoperative psychological distress and, in particular, depression increased after surgical treatment for lung cancer. Postoperative anxiety and depression were aggravated by residual symptoms after surgery. Careful psychological evaluation and appropriate management are required to improve patients\u0027 quality of life after lung cancer surgery.","title":"Risk factors for postoperative anxiety and depression after surgical treatment for lung cancerâ€ .","pubmedId":"26410631"}
