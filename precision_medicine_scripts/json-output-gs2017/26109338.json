Altered microRNA expression is associated with development and progression of breast cancer. Here we examined the role of miR-217 in chemo-sensitivity, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. And the relative molecular mechanism was described.\nAfter transfection with miR-217 mimic, the breast cancer cells were treated with different chemotherapy reagents and the cell growth was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) assay. The Caspase-Glo3/7 assay was used to evaluate the effect of miR-217 on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells. The migration and invasion of breast cancer cells were examined by BD transwell migration and matrigel invasion assays. The apoptotic proteins and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were detected by western blot.\nThe survival rate of MCF7 cells was increased after overexpression of miR-217 when MCF7 cells were treated with tamoxifen and etoposide. The survival rate of SKBR3 cells was significantly increased after overexpression of miR-217 when SKBR3 cells were treated with lapatinib. MiR-217 reduced the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to the effects of chemotherapy reagents by inhibiting the caspase 3/7 activities. Meanwhile, altered miR-217 expression affected migration and invasion of MCF7 cells and SKBR3 cells. In addition, the overexpression of miR-217 inhibited E-cadherin expression and promoted Snail expression. MiR-217 activates AKT by downregulation of PTEN in breast cancer cells.\nOur results strongly suggest that miR-217 plays vital roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression in breast cancer. Our results suggest that miR-217 might serve as a potential molecular target for breast cancer treatment.","title":"MicroRNA-217 overexpression induces drug resistance and invasion of breast cancer cells by targeting PTEN signaling.","pubmedId":"26109338"}
