Survival after surgical treatment of cholangiocarcinoma associated with opisthorchiasis was studied prospectively in 30 patients, all of whom resided in an endemic area. The median age was 52 (range 32-69) years and twenty-five patients were men. Seven patients had their tumours removed, four with concomitant liver resection. Twenty-two patients underwent palliative biliary bypass procedures to a segmental duct. Laparotomy with biopsy of metastatic lesions was undertaken in one patient with multiple lymph node metastases and peritoneal seedlings. No patient received postoperative chemotherapy or radiation treatment. Patients were followed for 2 years or until death. The 1-year survival rate after tumour resection was 86 per cent and the 2-year survival rate 43 per cent. After palliative procedures the 1-year survival rate was 26 per cent; no patient reached 2 years and the median survival time was 8 months. Survival after surgical treatment of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with opisthorchiasis is broadly similar to that reported for cholangiocarcinoma without liver fluke infestation.","title":"Cholangiocarcinoma in patients with opisthorchiasis.","pubmedId":"8869303"}
