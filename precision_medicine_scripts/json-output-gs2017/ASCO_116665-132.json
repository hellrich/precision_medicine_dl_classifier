Methods:  Pts with advanced solid tumors, who failed at least one line of standard therapy, were offered an on-purpose tumor biopsy for molecular characterization. Biopsies were mainly obtained using 18G needles under CT or ultra-sound control, from metastatic or primary tumor sites. DNA extracted from fresh tumor biopsies was analyzed by CGH (Agilent platform) (if  50% tumor cells in the sample) and by sequencing for 30 target genes (if  30% tumor cells in the sample). An expert panel of scientists and clinicians reviewed results to determine the biological signification of the GA and match such pts to the most relevant targeted therapy available (mainly in early clinical trials). PFS using therapy based on GA was compared to the PFS for the most recent therapy on which the pt had just experienced progression (PFS ratio).  Results:  From December 2011 to august 2012, 129 heavily pretreated pts (median of 3 previous lines) were consented. Among them, 111 (86%) had a dedicated tumor biopsy. An actionable target was identified in 52 patients (40%). Among them, 25 pts (23% of biopsied pts) have been treated with a targeted therapy. The median time between biopsy and molecular results was 21 days [17  28]. GA of interest encompassed FGF ligand or receptor amplification (n\u003d9), cyclin amplification or deletion (n\u003d4), KRAS/BRAF/NRAS mutation (n\u003d3), PI3K amplification or PTEN deletion (n\u003d3), EGFR amplification or mutation (n\u003d3) (outside lung cancer), HER2 amplification (n\u003d2) (outside breast cancer), EML4/ALK translocation (n\u003d1). Among the 25 pts treated according to their GA, we observed 5 PR (20%), 14 SD (56%) and 3 PD (12%). Three pts (12%) were not evaluable because of early discontinuation of the therapy. PFS ratio was \u003e1.3 among 9 out of 19 evaluable pt (47%).  Conclusions:  High throughput molecular analysis is feasible in daily practice. It allows enrichment of phase I trials with specific GA, and leads to promising anti-tumor activity (20% PR as compared to the classical 7-10% PR obtained in all comers phase I trials).
