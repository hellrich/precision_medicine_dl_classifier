Genomic studies have focused on germline determinants of MBC risk, with minimal knowledge of somatic changes in these cancers.\nUsing a TruSeq amplicon cancer panel, this study evaluated 48 familial MBCs (3 BRCA1 germline mutant, 17 BRCA2 germline mutant and 28 BRCAX) for hotspot somatic mutations and copy number changes in 48 common cancer genes.\nTwelve missense mutations included nine PIK3CA mutations (seven in BRCAX patients), two TP53 mutations (both in BRCA2 patients) and one PTEN mutation. Common gains were seen in GNAS (34.1%) and losses were seen in GNAQ (36.4%), ABL1 (47.7%) and ATM (34.1%). Gains of HRAS (37.5% vs 3%, P\u003d0.006), STK11 (25.0% vs 0%, P\u003d0.01) and SMARCB1 (18.8% vs 0%, P\u003d0.04) and the loss of RB1 (43.8% vs 13%, P\u003d0.03) were specific to BRCA2 tumours.\nThis study is the first to perform high-throughput somatic sequencing on familial MBCs. Overall, PIK3CA mutations are most commonly seen, with fewer TP53 and PTEN mutations, similar to the profile seen in luminal A female breast cancers. Differences in mutation profiles and patterns of gene gains/losses are seen between BRCA2 (associated with TP53/PTEN mutations, loss of RB1 and gain of HRAS, STK11 and SMARCB1) and BRCAX (associated with PIK3CA mutations) tumours, suggesting that BRCA2 and BRCAX MBCs may be distinct and arise from different tumour pathways. This has implications on potential therapies, depending on the BRCA status of MBC patients.","title":"Mutational profiling of familial male breast cancers reveals similarities with luminal A female breast cancer with rare TP53 mutations.","pubmedId":"25490678"}
