Amplification of chromosomal region 12q13-q14, which contains the CDK4 proto-oncogene, was identified in a subset of fusion-positive RMS. Other tumor types with CDK4 amplification or overexpression, including liposarcoma and neuroblastoma, are sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition, suggesting that CDK4/6-targeted therapies may provide a new treatment strategy in fusion-positive RMS. To evaluate the role of CDK4 in chromosomal region 12q13-14 amplification in fusion-positive RMS and the potential clinical utility of CDK4/6 inhibition in this disease setting, we examined the biological consequences of CDK4 knockdown, CDK4 overexpression, and pharmacologic CDK4/6 inhibition in fusion-positive RMS in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of CDK4 abrogated proliferation and transformation of 12q13-14-amplified and non-amplified fusion-positive RMS cells via G1-phase cell cycle arrest. This arrest was associated with reduced RB phosphorylation and E2F-responsive gene expression. Significant differences in E2F target expression, however, were not observed in RMS cells overexpressing CDK4 or in fusion-positive tumors harboring 12q13-14 amplification relative to control cells or tumors lacking amplification, respectively. Treatment with the small molecule CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 phenocopied CDK4 knockdown, decreasing viability, RB phosphorylation, and E2F-responsive gene expression and inducing G1-phase cell cycle arrest. All fusion-positive RMS cell lines showed sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition, with evidence of differential antitumor activity resulting from an inverse relationship between CDK4 expression and inhibitor vulnerability. This variable responsiveness to LEE011 was recapitulated in xenograft models of CDK4-amplified and non-amplified fusion-positive RMS. Our findings demonstrate that CDK4 is necessary for RB-E2F-mediated G1-phase cell cycle progression, proliferation, and transformation in fusion-positive RMS regardless of CDK4 amplification status. Our studies further indicate that single-agent LEE011 is active in the setting of fusion-positive RMS and suggest that CDK4 amplification may be a marker of reduced sensitivity whereas low CDK4 expression may be associated with higher susceptibility to CDK4/6 inhibition. Collectively, our data provide preclinical evidence supporting further investigation of CDK4/6-targeted therapies in treatment regimens for fusion-positive RMS.","title":"CDK4 amplification reduces sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition in fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-3093"}
