Erlotinib was given at a dose of 100 mg daily from D1 to D28. 1000 mg/m(2) of gemcitabine was given on D1,8,15 and 1660 mg/m(2)/day of capecitabine was given from D1 to 21, repeated every 4 weeks. Response was assessed every 8 weeks.\nA total of 47 patients were enrolled. Response rate and disease control rate was 32.6% (95% CI, 18.6-46.6%) and 83.7% (95% CI, 72.7-94.7%) respectively. The PFS was 6.5 months (95% CI, 3.4-9.7) and OS was 12.0 months (95% CI, 8.6-15.9). The Gr 3/4 toxicities were: neutropenia (6.8%), thrombocytopenia (3.2%), anemia (1.6%). nausea (1.6%), vomiting (1.6%), anorexia (5.3%), rash (2.4%). The EGFR expression was associated with shorter OS and ERCC2 expression was associated with longer PFS and OS. PFS and OS were not different according to K-RAS mutation or polymorphism of RRM1 and CDA.\nErlotinib, gemcitabine and capecitabine combination showed promising efficacy and good tolerability in metastatic PC. This efficacy was observed irrespective of K-RAS mutation, and EGFR expression was poor prognostic factor for OS.","title":"A phase II trial of erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine and capecitabine in previously untreated metastatic/recurrent pancreatic cancer: combined analysis with translational research.","pubmedId":"21404106"}
