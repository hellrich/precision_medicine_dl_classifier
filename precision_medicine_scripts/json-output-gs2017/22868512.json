This article discusses in detail the significance of first-line and second-line epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and EML4-ALK. Furthermore, the article summarizes the implications and future prospects of using molecular testing in the field of NSCLC with focus on EGFR mutations, KRAS mutation, EML4-ALK fusion gene detection, and EGFR expression.","title":"First-line therapy of mutated non-small cell lung cancer: an update.","pubmedId":"22868512"}
