The objective of this study was to determine the functional and prognostic implications of Trim44 in colorectal cancer. The Trim44 gene is recurrently amplified and upregulated in CRC. Trim44 overexpression and amplification are associated with poor survival in patients with CRC and the prognostic significance was confirmed by independent patient cohorts. High expression of Trim44 associates with activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway in CRC tissues.TRIM44 knockdown reduced proliferation, and invasion of colorectal cancer cells, as well as growth and metastasis of xenograft tumors in nude mice; overexpression of TRIM44 had the opposite effects. TRIM44 interacted physically with Shp-1, increasing its ubiquitination and degradation. Increasedlevels of TRIM44 in human colorectal tumors correlated with reduced expression of SHP-1 and increased phosphorylation of STAT3. In a word, The putative ubiquitin ligase TRIM44 is up-regulated in human colorectal tumors compared with nontumor tissues. Levels of TRIM44 correlate with tumor progression and patient survival times. TRIM44 interacts with SHP-1, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, and TRIM44 might promote colorectal malignant transformation via this mechanism.","title":"Trim44 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer with amplification, promoting degradation of SHP-1 and activating JAK/STAT pathway by ubiquitin modification.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-520"}
