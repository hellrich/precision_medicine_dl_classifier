The disease distribution shows an approximately 1:1 male/female ratio and a median survival of circa five months. Although such features as central necrosis and hypervascularity are suggestive of pancreatic ASC, more research is necessary to identify other, more specific markers for this tumor subtype. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy has also been described with ASC of the pancreas, likely as a result of PTHrP production by the squamous component of the tumor. Similar to the therapeutics of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is currently indicated for resectable ASC of the pancreas, while gemcitabine or gemcitabine combinations are used for a more advanced disease. Both pathologic and molecular features of pancreatic ASC characterize it as a distinct subtype of pancreatic cancer. As a result, its molecular and genetic makeup could be exploited for both diagnostic and therapeutic quests in the future.","title":"Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas: a distinct clinicopathologic entity.","pubmedId":"20697320"}
