It usually presents as a single mass, and the prognosis varies according to the degree of histological differentiation. Multicentric liposarcoma is an unusual presentation of this tumour in which several independent lesions develop and generally display an aggressive pattern. It may be difficult to establish a precise diagnosis because of the problems differentiating between recurrence or metastasis of a single liposarcoma and multicentric primary lesions. A systematic review was undertaken, assessing articles on multicentric liposarcoma, with emphasis on the diagnostic criteria and treatment for this condition. Illustrative cases of multicentric liposarcoma from our Institution are presented.","title":"Multicentric liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"21473438"}
