A blood-based assay that determines PTEN status in CRPC patients could enable informed treatment decisions such as the use of a PI3K-targeted therapy. Here we examined the relationship between PTEN status in CTCs and matched archival and fresh tumor biopsies in 43 CRPC patients.Methods:Nucleated cells from CRPC patient blood were plated onto glass slides and subjected to IF staining and CTC identification by high-speed fluorescent scanners at Epic Sciences. CTCs were identified as CK+/CD45- cells with intact DAPI nuclei, and samples with 4 CTCs per 2 slides (74%) were then tested for PTEN by FISH. Heterozygous loss was defined as a decrease in PTEN copies (PTEN \u003c CEP10 and \u003c 2 copies) and homozygous loss as zero PTEN copies. PTEN IHC in tissue was stained using CST clone 138G6 and H-scores  200 counted as loss.Results:Heterozygous or homozygous loss of PTEN by FISH was observed in 16 of 43 patients (37%) by CTC analysis. In addition to loss of PTEN, changes in ploidy were frequently observed and broad heterogeneity seen both within and between patients. The PTEN status in CTCs correlated strongly with the PTEN status in metastatic tissue: All 10 patients that exhibited homozygous PTEN loss in CTCs showed concordant homozygous PTEN loss in fresh biopsies. This correlation extended to three patients that showed correlated mixed homozygous and hemizygous PTEN loss populations in CTCs and tissue. Drift or change in PTEN status from archival to fresh biopsies occurred in 15 patients, In 12 of these patients, PTEN status in CTCs was reflective of the status in fresh tissue. Together with PTEN evaluation, the analysis of androgen receptor expression by immunofluorescence and ERG rearrangements by FISH proved feasibility of multiplex biomarker assessment in CTCs. This analysis demonstrated heterogeneity of AR phenotypes and a positive association of ERG rearrangements and PTEN loss in CTCs, consistent with literature reports.Conclusion:Our results illustrate the potential for using CTCs as a non-invasive, real-time biopsy to determine a patient\u0027s current PTEN status. PTEN status will be determined using these assays in an ongoing AKT inhibitor Phase II trial.","title":"Evaluation of PTEN status in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and matched tumor tissue from castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-4819"}
