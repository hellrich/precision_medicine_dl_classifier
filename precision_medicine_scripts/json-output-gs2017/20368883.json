{"organisms":["9606"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Ductal carcinoma of the prostate is a rare histologic subtype of prostate carcinoma. It represents 0.4% to 0.8% of all prostate cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. Given the paucity of cases reported in the literature on ductal prostate carcinoma, little is known about how this cancer responds to cytotoxic chemotherapy. We report the case of a 56-year-old male who presented to our clinic with hemoptysis, cough and hematuria and was found to have metastatic ductal carcinoma of the prostate. He was initiated on docetaxel chemotherapy, which has been previously shown to improve overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, but has never been studied in this less common subtype of prostate cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the following is the first reported case of a patient with metastatic ductal carcinoma of the prostate responding to docetaxel chemotherapy.","title":"Metastatic ductal carcinoma of the prostate: a rare variant responding to a common treatment.","pubmedId":"20368883"}
