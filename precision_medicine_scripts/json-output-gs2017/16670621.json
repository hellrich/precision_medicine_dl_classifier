However, the small number of patients in various series has hampered survival analysis.\nOne hundred thirteen patients with ampullary cancer underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy between 1989 and 2000, with 48% morbidity and 8% mortality. One hundred four patients who survived the operation were analyzed to identify predictors of long-term survival.\nThe overall median survival was 30.1 (1.6-140.0) months with actuarial 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 79%, 43%, and 33%, respectively. Lymph node metastasis (P \u003d 0.002) and vascular invasion (P \u003d 0.008) were 2 independent factors adversely influencing survival. Perioperative blood transfusion (P \u003d 0.001) and vascular invasion (P \u003d 0.026) were important factors predicting recurrent disease.\nLymph node metastasis and vascular invasion were 2 important factors, which adversely influenced survival in patients with ampullary cancer. Perioperative blood transfusion and vascular invasion were associated with recurrent disease.","title":"Long-term survival and recurrence patterns in ampullary cancer.","pubmedId":"16670621"}
