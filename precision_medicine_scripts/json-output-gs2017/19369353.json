Viruses, in turn, have evolved elaborate mechanisms to subvert IFN- and p53-mediated host innate immune responses. Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes several viral IFN regulatory factors (vIRF1 to vIRF4) within a cluster of loci, their functions being primarily to inhibit host IFN-mediated innate immunity and deregulate p53-mediated cell growth control. Despite its significant homology and similar genomic location to other vIRFs, vIRF4 is distinctive, as it does not target and antagonize host IFN-mediated signal transduction. Here, we show that KSHV vIRF4 interacts with the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to the reduction of p53, a tumor suppressor, via proteasome-mediated degradation. The central region of vIRF4 is required for its interaction with MDM2, which led to the suppression of MDM2 autoubiquitination and, thereby, a dramatic increase in MDM2 stability. Consequently, vIRF4 expression markedly enhanced p53 ubiquitination and degradation, effectively suppressing p53-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that KSHV vIRF4 targets and stabilizes the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase to facilitate the proteasome-mediated degradation of p53, perhaps to circumvent host growth surveillance and facilitate viral replication in infected cells. Taken together, the indications are that the downregulation of p53-mediated cell growth control is a common characteristic of the four KSHV vIRFs and that p53 is indeed a key factor in the host\u0027s immune surveillance program against viral infections.","title":"Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus viral interferon regulatory factor 4 targets MDM2 to deregulate the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.","pubmedId":"19369353"}
