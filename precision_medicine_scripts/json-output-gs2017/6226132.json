The aetiologies found were: hypertensive heart disease alone in six cases; hypertensive and alcoholic heart disease in two cases; alcoholic heart disease alone in five; alcoholic and pulmonary heart disease in one; alcohol with possible hypertensive heart disease in one. Eleven cases were classified as being idiopathic mainly due to lack of data and in five of these hypertension was suspected as being the cause. The series qualitatively represented the spectrum of non-rheumatic heart disease seen in patients admitted to the Central Hospital, Ndola, Zambia. Hypertension had a central role in the causation of massive cardiomegaly. Follow-up of several patients enabled observations on the cardiac effects of hypertension and alcoholism operating simultaneously and on the relationship between hypertension and congestive cardiomyopathy.","title":"Cardiomegaly in Northern Zambia: clinico-pathological observations.","pubmedId":"6226132"}
