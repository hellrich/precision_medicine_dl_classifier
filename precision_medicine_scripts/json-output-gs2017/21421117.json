The traditional approach of surgical resection for early-stage disease, potentially followed by chemotherapy, as well chemotherapy (with or without radiation) in later stages of disease is being supplemented with a personalized approach. The personalized approach has classically been used by the oncologist based on clinical/pathological parameters such as the performance status of the patient and histology of lung cancer. As molecular mechanisms have been explored in lung cancer more recently, the personalized approach also has incorporated molecular abnormalities. In particular, EGFR, K-ras, ALK, MET, CBL, and COX2, have come to the forefront as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Thus, we review the various molecular mechanisms in lung cancer and the role of novel therapeutics.","title":"Personalized treatment of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21421117"}
