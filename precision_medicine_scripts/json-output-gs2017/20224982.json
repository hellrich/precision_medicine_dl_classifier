This study aimed to evaluate the safety of laparoscopic resection of TCC.\nFifty-three patients undergoing laparoscopic resection of TCC (group A) were compared with 39 patients undergoing open resection of TCC (group B) and 200 patients undergoing laparoscopic resection of ascending or descending colon cancer (group C).\nMean operating time was longer (224 vs. 157 min), and mean estimated blood loss was lower (40 vs. 79 ml) in group A than in group B, but these were similar in groups A and C. The rates of conversion to open surgery were similar in groups A and C (1.9% vs. 1.0%). Tumor stage was more advanced in group B than in group A. All patients in groups A and B underwent pathologic R0 resection. The rates of postoperative complications did not differ significantly between groups (9.4% vs. 7.7% vs. 5.0%). Time to flatus (1.7 vs. 2.5 days), time to liquid diet (2.4 vs. 5.3 days), and hospital stay (12 vs. 15 days) were significantly shorter in group A than in group B, but similar in groups A and C.\nLaparoscopic resection for TCC can be performed safely with similar short-term postoperative outcomes seen for colon cancer at other sites. Laparoscopic resection may be associated with faster gastrointestinal recovery and shorter length of hospital stay, compared with open surgery.","title":"Short-term outcomes of laparoscopic colectomy for transverse colon cancer.","pubmedId":"20224982"}
