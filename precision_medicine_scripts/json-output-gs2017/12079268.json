In the last decade large randomized controlled trials have been undertaken that demonstrate the improved patient outcomes. There is an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in chronic pancreatitis, hereditary pancreatitis and a variety of familial cancer syndromes. The optimum outcome from pancreatic cancer needs management by multidisciplinary teams in regional specialist units. Endoscopic stenting, good pain relief and pancreatic enzyme supplementation are the basis of care in advanced pancreatic cancer. Chemotherapy prolongs survival in advanced pancreatic cancer with little to be gained using drugs other than 5FU. Resection, if possible, prolongs life and provides the best quality of life. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is of no benefit but chemotherapy may improve survival. Alongside the evolution in clinical management has been the elucidation of the molecular events that underlie pancreatic cancer and this knowledge has guided the introduction of targeted treatments for pancreatic cancer.","title":"Surgical and medical therapy for pancreatic carcinoma.","pubmedId":"12079268"}
