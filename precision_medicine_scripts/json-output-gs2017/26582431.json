Several oncogenic druggable alterations have been so far identified, with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements representing one of the newest and most appealing. Crizotinib is now recognized as the standard of care in ALK-positive NSCLC due to the positive results of recently published trials. Unfortunately, resistance inevitably occurs within the first year of treatment. Overcoming resistance is the major challenge in clinical oncology, and novel potent ALK inhibitors are currently under evaluation, including ceritinib. Ceritinib is an oral, potent, second-generation ALK inhibitor demonstrating activity in patients who develop resistance to crizotinib. Recent data also suggested efficacy in ALK-inhibitor-naive population, thus supporting investigation of the drug in front-line setting.
