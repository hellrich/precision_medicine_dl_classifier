As with colon cancer, it seems likely that there is a stepwise development of invasive malignant melanoma, and that interaction between genotype and environmental stimuli may be very different at each successive stage of melanoma progression. Unraveling these steps is the current challenge.","title":"Risk factors for the development of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"12380046"}
