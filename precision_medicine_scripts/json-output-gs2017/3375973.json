Despite the difficulty of removing apical, primary optic nerve meningioma without sacrificing the central retinal artery, the authors prefer a surgical approach backed up by radiation therapy. It appears that general improvement, although generally elusive, is worth the risk incurred in trying to overcome the deficits stemming from these tumors.","title":"Intraorbital meningiomas.
