Patients with T3 or deeper carcinoma of the stomach are intraoperatively randomized to either extensive intraoperative peritoneal lavage + arm or extensive intraoperative peritoneal lavage- arm. A total of 300 patients will be accrued from 20 institutions. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival, and secondary end-points are overall survival, peritoneal recurrence-free survival and incidence of adverse events.
