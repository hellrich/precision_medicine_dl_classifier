The patients received neoadjuvant therapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Surgery was scheduled 3 to 4 weeks after the last neoadjuvant therapy; then, the medical team assessed each patient\u0027s resectability status. The primary endpoint was the resectability rate.\nFrom April 2012 to April 2014, 42 patients were enrolled and received bevacizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin. Grade 3 or 4 induction-related AEs included fatigue in 5 patients, neutropenia in 4 patients, hypertension in 1 patient, anemia in 1 patient, and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient. One patient achieved a complete response, 22 achieved a partial response, 17 had stable disease, and 2 had progressive disease. After neoadjuvant therapy, 31 patients (73.8%) underwent surgery, including 11 who underwent pneumonectomy. Complete (R0) resection was achieved in 22 patients (52.4%). Reoperation was required in 1 patient because of a bleeding intercostal artery. No perioperative thromboembolic events or wound-healing problems were observed. The median event-free survival was 15.4 months, and the 1-year event-free survival rate was 56.1%.\nTreatment with neoadjuvant bevacizumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery appears to be feasible and safe in patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma.
