The PTEN protein negatively regulates cell migration and cell survival and induces a G1 cell cycle block via negative regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3\u0027-kinase/protein kinase B/Akt signaling pathway. PTEN is frequently mutated or deleted in both prostate cancer cell lines and primary prostate cancers. A murine polyclonal antiserum was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion polypeptide of the COOH terninus of PTEN. Archival paraffin tissue sections from 109 cases of resected prostate cancer were immunostained with the antiserum, using DU145 and PC-3 cells as positive and negative controls, respectively. PTEN expression was seen in the secretory cells. Cases were considered positive when granular cytoplasmic staining was seen in all tumor cells, mixed when areas of both positive and negative tumor cell clones were seen, and negative when adjacent benign prostate tissue but not tumor tissue showed positive staining. Seventeen cases (15.6%) of prostate cancer were positive, 70 cases (64.2%) were mixed, and 22 cases (20.2%) were negative. Total absence of PTEN expression correlated with the Gleason score (P \u003d 0.0081) and correlated more significantly with a Gleason score of 7 or higher (P \u003d 0.0004) and with advanced pathological stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer stages T3b and T4; P \u003d 0.0078). Thus, loss of PTEN protein is correlated with pathological markers of poor prognosis in prostate cancer.","title":"Loss of PTEN expression in paraffin-embedded primary prostate cancer correlates with high Gleason score and advanced stage.","pubmedId":"10485474"}
