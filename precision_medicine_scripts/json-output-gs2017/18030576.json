Imatinib mesylate, a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is highly efficient against locally advanced or metastatic GIST. We report a case of unresectable duodenal GIST, which we were able to resect with curative intent after down-staging treatment with a dosage of imatinib 400 mg daily for 8 months. We performed Whipple\u0027s procedure combined with en bloc resection of the right kidney and adrenal gland. The patient was recurrence free at his 24-month follow-up examination. Down-staging treatment may be worthwhile in selected patients, but further prospective studies of imatinib in this setting are necessary. We think that imatinib should be continued postoperatively, as the risk of recurrence in these patients may be high.","title":"Successful resection of an advanced duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor after down-staging with imatinib: report of a case.","pubmedId":"18030576"}
