Embryonal carcinoma (EC) comprises a histological subgroup of TGCT that exhibits pluripotent characteristics similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells. The genetic drivers underlying malignant transformation of TGCT, including ECs, are unknown. To elucidate the abnormal genetic events potentially contributing to TGCT malignancy, such as the formation of fusion genes or expression of aberrant transcript variants, we have previously performed RNA sequencing of EC cell lines and their non-malignant ES cell line counterparts. From this dataset, we identified and characterized eight novel fusion transcripts and one gene with alternative promoter usage, ETV6. These were the first fusion genes to be shown in TGCT (Hoff et al., Cancer Research, in press).To search for recurrence of the originally nominated TGCT specific fusion transcripts and other transcript variants in an external sample series, we have here parsed raw RNA sequencing data from 102 primary TGCTs obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; unpublished). In this process, we have evaluated multiple fusion finder algorithms and approaches to determine the optimal method, on the basis of sensitivity and specificity, to query specific transcript variants and breakpoints in RNA sequencing datasets.We were able to detect the recurrent fusion transcripts; RCC1-ABHD12B, RCC1-HENMT1, CLEC6A-CLEC4D and the transcript variant of ETV6, which was previously detected from our in-house RNA sequencing dataset from EC cell lines. We also demonstrate that expression of several fusion transcripts correlate significantly with the histological subtype. In conclusion, the novel fusion transcripts and ETV6 transcript variant are expressed from a high fraction of primary TGCTs with low differentiation grade, as detected across independent sample series.","title":"Transcriptome analyses reveal fusion transcripts and transcript variants that are recurrent across sample series of testicular germ cell tumors","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2700"}
