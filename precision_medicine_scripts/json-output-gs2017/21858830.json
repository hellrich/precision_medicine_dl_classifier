Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is mandatory to identify the regional nodal basin(s) accurately for a newly diagnosed H\u0026N primary melanoma of at least 1mm or greater. A wide local excision should be delayed if SLN mapping is indicated, to minimize watershed effect and maximize accuracy in identifying the \"true\" SLN because of the complex lymphatic network in the H\u0026N region. An experienced multidisciplinary team is required for optimal identification of H\u0026N SLNs. In general, selective SLND can replace ELND to minimize the complications of a neck dissection. Completion lymph node dissection is only indicated when the SLN is positive. A nerve stimulator should be used during selective SLND in the parotid and posterior triangle to minimize the injury to the facial and spinal accessory nerve.","title":"Role of selective sentinel lymph node dissection in head and neck melanoma.","pubmedId":"21858830"}
