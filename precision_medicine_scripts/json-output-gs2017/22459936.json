Therefore, there is great need for alternative treatments. Knowledge of the KRAS and BRAF mutational status would become clinically important with regard to the possible use of anti-EGFR therapies.\nDNA was extracted from paraffin embedded tumour samples from 57 cases of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC) and from fresh frozen tumour samples from 58 cases of intestinal-type sinonasal adenocarcinoma (ITAC). Point mutations were analysed for KRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) and BRAF (exon 15, V600E) by direct sequencing.\nNeither KRAS nor BRAF showed any mutations in the SNSCC, whereas 7/58 (12%) ITAC harboured KRAS mutations and no BRAF mutations. All seven cases with KRAS mutation concerned well-differentiated and less aggressive (papillary and colonic type) ITAC, all patients being woodworkers and 4/7 tobacco smokers.\nNeither of SNSCCs carried mutations in KRAS and BRAF and a low frequency of KRAS mutation was found in ITAC. This suggests that KRAS and BRAF mutations play a limited role in the development of sinonasal cancer and that mutation analysis is not useful as a screening test for sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy in sinonasal cancer.","title":"KRAS and BRAF mutations in sinonasal cancer.","pubmedId":"22459936"}
