This study tested three tumor marker levels including CEA, SCCA, and bFGF to explore their value in lung cancer diagnosis and pathological type judgment. Venous blood was extracted from lung cancer patients, lung benign lesion patients and healthy control. Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay was applied to detect serum CEA and SCCA content. ELISA was used to test serum bFGF level. Serum CEA, SCCA, and bFGF levels and positive rates were significantly higher in lung cancer group than that of lung benign disease group and health control (P \u003c 0.05). bFGF showed higher detection sensitivity than CEA in lung cancer (P \u003c 0.05). Three joint detection sensitivity was higher than single test (P \u003c 0.05), while its specificity was lower (P \u003c 0.05), and the accuracy presented no significant difference. Serum CEA and SCCA levels and positive rates were obviously higher in non-small cell lung cancer patients when compared with small cell lung cancer patients (P \u003c 0.05), while bFGF level was similar between small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. bFGF showed higher detection rate than SCCA in small cell lung cancer (P \u003c 0.05). Three joint detection exhibited higher positive rate in small cell lung cancer and non-small lung cancer than single test. Serum CEA, SCCA and bFGF joint detection improved detection sensitivity in lung cancer and had important reference value for pathological type deduction.","title":"Clinical significance of joint detection of serum CEA, SCCA, and bFGF in the diagnosis of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26464712"}
