Approximately 50% of melanomas harbor BRAF(V600) mutations. This report describes a 32-year-old man with metastatic BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma who presented with cardiac involvement. Recently developed treatment options for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma include BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib), MEK inhibitors (trametinib), and immune-based therapeutics (interleukin-2 or ipilimumab), but the most effective strategy for first-line therapy is heavily debated. Opinions vary for treatment selection, but the general consensus recommends immune-based therapies initially for asymptomatic patients with low-volume disease, and BRAF inhibitors for those with highly symptomatic or rapidly progressing disease. In this case, melanoma with cardiac involvement, although clinically uncommon, presents challenging management decisions.
