There are still few sensitive and clinically applicable ctDNA detection methods. In this study, we used a broad, hybrid capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) assay to screen actionable genetic alterations in plasma ctDNA with diverse cancer patients.   Methods:    147 cases of advanced tumor were enrolled, including 65 lung cancers, 39 breast cancers, 23 gastric cancers, and 20 colorectal cancers. 7708 exons of 508 tumor related genes and 78 introns of 19 frequently rearranged genes were assessed for base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. The average median sequencing depth was 940.  Results:    Targetable genetic alterations were detected in 19 of 65 (29.2%) lung cancers, 15 of 39 (38.5%) breast cancers, and 6 of 20 (30%) colorectal cancers. Remarkably, these alterations were only found in 3 of 23 (13.0%) gastric cancers. Specifically, EGFR mutation was found in 8 of 65 (12.3%) lung cancers. HER2 gene amplification was detected in 8 of 39 (20.5%) breast cancers, and in 1 of 23 (4.3%) gastric cancers. Additionally, K-ras mutation was found in 4 of 20 (20.0%) colorectal cancers. The common actionable alterations found in various cancer types were in HER2 (n \u003d 12), EGFR (n \u003d 9), K-ras (n \u003d 6), and PTEN (n \u003d 4).   Conclusions:    29.3% (43/147) of all ctDNA samples harbored at least one actionable genetic alteration identified by NGS testing. Noninvasive actionable genetic alterations detection in ctDNA by NGS assay might be an efficient strategy to guide personalized therapy for advanced cancer patients.","title":"Broad, hybrid capture-based next generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA identified actionable genetic alterations in advanced cancer with treatment resistance.","pubmedId":"ASCO_148642-156"}
