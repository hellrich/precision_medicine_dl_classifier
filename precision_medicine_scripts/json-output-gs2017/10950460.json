Current data suggest that consuming a Western style diet, that is, one high in meat, refined grains, and sugar and low in vegetables and fiber, may contribute to risk of colon cancer. There also are data to support a reduction in colon cancer risk from consuming high levels of calcium and folate. Energy balance and maintaining an appropriate body weight have been associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. An important part of the energy balance equation is physical activity. High levels of physical activity have consistently been identified as being associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. It is estimated that 13% of colon cancer can be attributed to being physically inactive, 12% of colon cancer can be attributed to eating a Western style diet, and 8% of colon cancer can be attributed to having a first degree relative with colorectal cancer.","title":"Diet, lifestyle, and colon cancer.","pubmedId":"10950460"}
