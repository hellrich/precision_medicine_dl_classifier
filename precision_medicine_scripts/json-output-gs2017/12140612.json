We carried out this study to determine a surgical strategy for patients with bile duct invasion of these tumors.\nForty-one patients with mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were classified as either having bile duct invasion ( n \u003d 26) or not having bile duct invasion ( n \u003d 15). Clinicopathologic findings, including postoperative outcomes, were compared between these two groups.\nPerineural invasion, lymphatic invasion, and a positive resection margin were more frequent in patients with ductal invasion. Patients with ductal invasion had lower survival rates than those without ductal invasion.\nIntraoperative frozen section examination of the bile duct stump to confirm a clear resection margin is required in patients with mass-forming tumors. Resection of the extrahepatic bile duct should be considered when tumor cells are identified at the surgical margin of the resected bile duct.","title":"Histologic bile duct invasion by a mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"12140612"}
