Complete plus partial responses to combination chemotherapy occur in 80-90% of all patients. Median survival is at present 11-17 months depending on the initial tumour stage. Overall 5-year survival is approximately 5%. The duration of treatment has been shortened to 5-6 months. The results of the use of hematopoietic growth factors have hitherto been disappointing with respect to survival, while a definite effect on the degree and number of infections has been documented, when aggressive chemotherapy is administered. For epidermoid-, adenoid- and large cell carcinoma, results are emerging indicating that preoperative and preirradiatory chemotherapy in stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer might have a substantial role in the overall management based on results from phase III trials. The studies are, however, rather modest in number and longer follow-up is necessary before recommendations for general use can be made. For patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (stage IIIb and IV), meta-analyses have yielded a small survival benefit (6 weeks) in favour of patients receiving chemotherapy vs. best supportive care. The treatment of this type of NSCLC should, however, still be considered to be experimental in order to define new innovative treatments. No improvement of the therapy of mesotheliomas has been reported.","title":"Lung cancer.","pubmedId":"8639395"}
