Healing of covered wounds is slower and mimics more closely wound healing in humans.\nForty-seven diabetic and twenty non-diabetic mice were used. A single wound (5 mm diameter) was created on the left flank of each animal and covered by Tegaderm HP dressing (Day 1). Wounds were irradiated (660 nm) for 20 s using a lower power (18 mW) or higher power (80 mW) laser starting immediately post-wounding for seven consecutive days (0.36 or 1.6 J/day); untreated wounds served as controls. Animals were euthanized on Day 8, 10, or 14. Wound specimens were cut and stained using haematoxylin and eosin, and picrosirius red, and examined by microscopy.\nResults confirmed that wound healing was impaired in diabetic mice. Analysis of the data demonstrated that Tegaderm HP dressing had retarded contraction (splinted the wounds) in a large proportion of diabetic mice and, to a lesser extent, in non-diabetic mice. Healing of splinted wounds was delayed compared to unsplinted wounds, but laser irradiation (1.6 J/day, 7 days) stimulated healing by re-epithelization and granulation tissue formation.\nThese are the first findings of laser-mediated stimulation of healing in splinted wounds. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of different constellation sets of laser parameters in this wound model.","title":"Laser photobiomodulation of wound healing in diabetic and non-diabetic mice: effects in splinted and unsplinted wounds.","pubmedId":"19916792"}
