As a single agent it has activity against HER2-positive breast cancer, but in combination with trastuzumab (H) the level of activity is greatly enhanced, with an overall clinical benefit rate of 50% in 66 patients (pts) who had been treated in 2 cohorts in a phase II study (Gelmon et al ASCO 2008, abs 1026). Pts had a tumor sample and serum sample for assessing biomarkers which might be prognostic or predictive of good outcomes. Methods: Pts with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who had progressed on H-based therapy as their last treatment for metastatic disease and who had measurable disease at baseline were enrolled. Tumor samples were collected at the time of primary surgery. Treatment with H was restarted and P was introduced concurrently. Response rate and stabilization of disease lasting 6 months (SD) as well as progression-free survival were evaluated. Proteins and mRNA of potential prognostic or predictive significance (HER2, shed HER2, HER3, epidermal growth factor receptor, amphiregulin, betacellulin, c-Myc, p-Akt, PIK3CA, PTEN, transforming growth factor-) were measured using immunohistochemistry and/or real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoassay or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Results: 66 pts were recruited, among whom there were 4 complete responses, 12 partial responses, and a further 17 pts experiencing SD 6 months, giving an overall clinical benefit rate of 50%. Assessment of the above biomarkers suggests that low mRNA for both HER2 and HER3 correlates with favorable clinical outcomes. Conclusions: The data appear to support the view that HER2 and HER3 mRNA expression may have predictive or prognostic value for P and H combination treatment outcomes in pts with HER2-positive disease and further investigation is warranted.","title":"Pertuzumab and trastuzumab: Exploratory biomarker correlations with clinical benefit in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_53065-74"}
