Both pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors in recipients and immunosuppressive drug toxicity may contribute to CVD. We sought to describe the prevalence of new-onset hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus in lung transplant recipients and to identify predisposing factors.\nOne hundred twenty-six patients without pre-transplant hypertension, hypercholesterolemia or diabetes were included in a retrospective descriptive study. All patients were initially on cyclosporine-based triple immunosuppression. Cumulative prevalence of new-onset hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes were calculated. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to identify independent pre-operative predictors.\nBy 3 years after transplantation, 90% of patients had developed at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor and 40% developed \u003e or \u003d 2 risk factors. The cumulative prevalence of new-onset hypertension at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years was 45%, 65%, 67% and 72%, respectively. The corresponding prevalence for hypercholesterolemia was 16%, 33%, 48% and 58%, and for diabetes 6%, 7%, 7% and 10%, respectively. The independent pre-transplant predictors were: for hypertension, diastolic blood pressure (odds ratio: 2.1 per 10 mm Hg [95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 3.5], p \u003d 0.005); for hypercholesterolemia, serum cholesterol level (OR: 1.8 per mmol/liter [95% CI: 1.3 to 2.5], p \u003c 0.001); and, for diabetes, cystic fibrosis diagnosis (OR: 7.4 [95% CI: 1.6 to 35.6], p \u003d 0.01) and blood glucose level (OR 2.2 per mmol/liter [95% CI 1.1 to 4.5], p \u003d 0.02).\nThe majority of cyclosporine-treated lung transplant recipients develop new-onset hypertension or hypercholesterolemia early after transplantation. Pre-transplant blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels and blood glucose levels are independent predictors of post-transplant hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, respectively.","title":"New-onset cardiovascular risk factors in lung transplant recipients.","pubmedId":"16210127"}
