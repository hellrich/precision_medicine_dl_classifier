In a subset of 116 patients, we examined HER2 concordance from the WT section and a TMA section from a randomly chosen additional block (a proxy of the core biopsy).\nOverall concordance for HER2 amplification between WT and TMA sections was 98.2%, and between sections from WT and from the additional block was 99.0%.\nThe high concordance rates support the use of TMA for the evaluation of HER2 amplification in breast cancer and suggest that FISH can be used to assess HER2 using core biopsies.","title":"Tissue Microarray Is a Reliable Tool for the Evaluation of HER2 Amplification in Breast Cancer.","pubmedId":"27630309"}
