DNA was extracted. Codon 12 K-ras mutations were examined using the two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with restriction enzyme digestion, followed by nonradioisotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and by means of automated DNA sequencing.\nK-ras mutation rate of the pancreatic carcinoma was 79%(19/24) which was significantly higher than that in the chronic pancreatitis 33%(8/24) (P\u003c0.01). It was also found that K-ras mutation rate was progressively increased from normal duct at the tumor free resection margin, peritumoral ductal hyperplasia, peritumoral ductal atypical hyperplasia to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The mutation pattern of K-ras 12 codon of chronic pancreatitis was GGT-GAT, GGT and CGT, which is identical to that in pancreatic carcinoma.\nK-ras mutation may play a role in the malignant transformation of pancreatic ductal cell. K-ras mutation was not specific enough to diagnose pancreatic carcinoma.","title":"Detection of point mutation in K-ras oncogene at codon 12 in pancreatic diseases.","pubmedId":"15040037"}
