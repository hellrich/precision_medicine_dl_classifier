The management of lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer particularly is influenced by discoveries of activating mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor and targeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, fusion genes involving anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and targeted therapies for Kristen-Rat-Sarcoma and MET protooncogenes. PET imaging plays an important role in assessing the biologic behavior of lung cancer and defining response to therapy. This review summarizes genomic discoveries in lung cancer and their implications for functional PET imaging.
