However, the results are conflicting. We performed this meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship.\nPubMed was searched to select studies. Case-control studies containing available genotype frequencies of the STK15 rs2273535 polymorphism were chosen, and the odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was utilized to assess the strength of association.\n52 studies - including 34,057 cases and 40,839 controls - were identified. A significant effect of the STK15 rs2273535 polymorphism on cancer risk was found (AA vs. TT: OR\u003d1.13, 95%CI\u003d1.01-1.26, Pheterogeneity\u003c0.001; AA vs.\nOR\u003d1.12, 95%CI\u003d1.02-1.22, Pheterogeneity\u003c0.001; TA/AA vs. TT: OR\u003d1.06, 95%CI\u003d1.01-1.12, Pheterogeneity\u003c0.001). Stratified analysis by cancer type revealed that the STK rs2273535 polymorphism may contribute to the risk of breast cancer (AA vs. TT: OR\u003d1.21, 95%CI\u003d1.01-1.44, Pheterogeneity\u003d0.002), colorectal cancer (AA vs.\nOR\u003d1.24, 95%CI\u003d1.05-1.47, Pheterogeneity\u003d0.124), and esophageal cancer (AA vs.\nOR\u003d1.19, 95%CI\u003d1.02-1.39, Pheterogeneity\u003d0.148). Further subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that there was a statistically increased cancer risk in Asians (AA vs.\nOR\u003d1.20, 95%CI\u003d1.05-1.37, Pheterogeneity\u003d0.004).\nThis meta-analysis suggests that the STK15 rs2273535 polymorphism is a candidate gene polymorphism for cancer susceptibility, especially in Asian populations.","title":"STK15 rs2273535 polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis of 74,896 subjects.","pubmedId":"24252226"}
