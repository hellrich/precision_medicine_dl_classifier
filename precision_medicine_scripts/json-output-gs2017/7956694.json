These cells have passed 103 passages in more than 1 year. The plating efficiency was 30.6%, and doubling time was 49.5 hours. Chromosomal analysis showed a human karyotype with a chromosome number between 66-130. JF305 cells exhibited epithelial morphologic features resembling the structure of the original tumor, and they grew to born tumor when inoculated again into nude mice. With immunohistochemical staining, the nuclei of JF305 cells were positive for p53. Therefore, JF305 offer a good model for the study of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and P53 gene mutation.","title":"[Establishment of a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line(JF305) with p53 expression].","pubmedId":"7956694"}
