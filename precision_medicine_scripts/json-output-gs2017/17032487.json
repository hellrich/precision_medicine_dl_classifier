On the basis of empirical findings that suggested which variables might be associated with perceived vulnerability for breast cancer, we investigated whether knowledge of breast cancer risk factors, cancer worry, intrusions about breast cancer, optimism about not getting cancer and perceived health status have a predictive value for perceived breast cancer vulnerability.\nIn a 3-step approach, we recruited 292 women from the general public in Germany who had neither a family history of breast cancer nor breast cancer themselves. After receiving an initial informational letter about study objectives, the women were interviewed by telephone and then asked to fill in a self-administered questionnaire.\nWe used structural equation modelling and hypothesized that each of the included variables has a direct influence on perceived vulnerability for breast cancer.\nWe found a valid model with acceptable fit indices. Optimism about not getting cancer, intrusions about breast cancer and women\u0027s perceived health status explained 32% of the variance of perceived vulnerability for breast cancer. Cancer worry and knowledge about breast cancer did not influence perceived vulnerability for breast cancer.\nPerceived vulnerability for breast cancer is associated with health-related variables more than with knowledge about breast cancer risk factors.","title":"Predicting perceived vulnerability for breast cancer among women with an average breast cancer risk.","pubmedId":"17032487"}
