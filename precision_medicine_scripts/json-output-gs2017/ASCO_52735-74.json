P as a single agent is not associated with meaningful activity against NSCLC, though stable disease (SD) has been observed in a phase II study (Herbst et al. Clin Cancer Res 2007;13:6175). Erlotinib (E) inhibits HER1 tyrosine kinase signalling and is widely registered for treatment of relapsed NSCLC. By inhibiting extracellular receptor dimerisation, as well as internal signal transduction through HER1, the combination of E and P would be expected to result in extensive blockade of HER signalling. Preclinical and initial response data seem to confirm this (Felip et al. ESMO 2008, abs 269P). Methods: 15 pts in 2 cohorts were treated in this Phase I, dose-escalating study. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction and the majority of treatment-related adverse events were CTC grade 1 or 2; full doses of each drug were recommended for further phase II evaluation. Potential biomarkers possibly associated with antitumour activity of P and E were measured in tumour tissue and evaluated against clinical disease status. Proteins of potential significance were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and mRNA by reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR). The panel of biomarkers measured included HER1 (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), HER2 and HER3. Results: Progression-free survival and tumour response were evaluated in all 15 pts. There were 3 partial responses (20%), with 1 further pt experiencing SD of  6 months. 13 pts had tumour samples that were suitable for full quantification of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 by RT qPCR as well as other markers by IHC. Interestingly, higher levels of mRNA for some HER receptors, as well as IHC markers, may correlate with treatment response. Conclusions: The biomarker analyses may provide some initial insight into markers of efficacy, although the data are limited by small numbers. Full data will be presented.","title":"Biomarker analyses from a phase l study of pertuzumab combined with erlotinib in patients (pts) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_52735-74"}
