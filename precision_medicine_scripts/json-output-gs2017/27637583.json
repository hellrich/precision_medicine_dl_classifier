The available biomarkers, such as cellular tumor antigen p53 (TP53), phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase and dual-specificity protein phosphatase (PTEN), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) genes alone might not be sufficient, and thus, new predictive and prognostic biomarkers are urgently required. The biomolecule class of microRNA represents a group of endogenously expressed regulatory factors primarily involved in control of pivotal cancer-related mechanisms including cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. Here, we review the current state of science regarding microRNA functionality in EC progression.","title":"The future therapy of endometrial cancer: microRNA\u0027s functionality, capability, and putative clinical application.","pubmedId":"27637583"}
