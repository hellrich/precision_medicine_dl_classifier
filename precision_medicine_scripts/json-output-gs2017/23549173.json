Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3] is known to possess antitumor actions in many cancer cells in vitro and in vivo models. However, its clinical use is hampered by hypercalcemia. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness and safety of a new generation, less calcemic analog of 1α,25(OH)2D3, 19-nor-2α-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (MART-10), in BxPC-3 human pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that MART-10 is at least 100-fold more potent than 1α,25(OH)2D3 in inhibiting BxPC-3 cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, accompanied by a greater upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 and a greater downregulation of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 5, leading to a greater increase in the fraction of cells in G0/G1 phase. No induction of apoptosis and no effect on Cdc25 phosphatases A and C were observed in the presence of either MART-10 or 1α,25(OH)2D3. In a xenograft mouse model, treatment with 0.3 µg/kg body weight of MART-10 twice/week for 3 weeks caused a greater suppression of BxPC-3 tumor growth than the same dose of 1α,25(OH)2D3 without inducing hypercalcemia and weight loss. In conclusion, MART-10 is a promising agent against pancreatic cancer growth. Further clinical trial is warranted.","title":"Evaluation of the potential therapeutic role of a new generation of vitamin D analog, MART-10, in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.","pubmedId":"23549173"}
