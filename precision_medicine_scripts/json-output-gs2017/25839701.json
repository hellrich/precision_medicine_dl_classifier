On immunohistochemistry the tumor was positive for villin and CK20 and negative for CK7, CDX2, and thyroid transcription factor-1. Molecular genetic analysis revealed an uncommon mutation; 249: AGG →ATG in the TP53 gene, which has not been previously described in association with a primary epididymal adenocarcinoma. Mutational analysis showed KRAS, BRAF, and VHL to be wild-type. No microsatellite instability was found.
