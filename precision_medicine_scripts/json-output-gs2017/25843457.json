Esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated a submucosal tumor in the descending part of the duodenum, and she was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) by other imaging studies. Elective surgery of the tumor was initially planned. However, on the 13th day of hospitalization, emergency pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed because of massive hematemesis with hemorrhagic shock. Genetic analysis demonstrated a deletion in exon 11 of the c-kit gene, which could dramatically alter the clinical course. Although duodenal GIST with active bleeding is comparatively rare, we have to assume that it is the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding and treat such cases with a minimally invasive surgical procedure and neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy. It is necessary to accumulate more cases with duodenal GIST to establish an evidence-based therapeutic strategy.
