Emerging clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with RET-rearranged NSCLC may also benefit from existing RET TKIs, including cabozantinib and vandetanib. However, the reported cases of lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) harboring gene rearrangements have been detected via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) from materials such as biopsy or resection. Fusion events identified in lung SCC raise the question of whether this histologic subtype should also be evaluated for merit molecular testing. This work was undertaken to study the prevalence of lung SCC harboring ALK, ROS1, and RET translocations.\nSquamous cell carcinomas were confirmed using both histological examination by pathologists and immunohistochemistry analysis with positive staining of P63 and CK5/6 combined with negative CK7 and TTF-1 staining. 214 samples from surgically resected patient tissues were used to search for ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements by a NanoString analysis method. Fusion events were detected in a single-tube, multiplex assay system that relied on a complementary strategy of interrogation of 3\u0027 gene overexpression and detection of specific fusion transcript variants.\nALK, ROS1 or RET gene rearrangements appeared 0 times out of 214 cases of lung SCC. Our data revealed that these fusions may be very rare in lung squamous cancer. The molecular screening strategy should therefore be focused on lung adenocarcinoma as the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommends.","title":"ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements in lung squamous cell carcinoma are very rare.","pubmedId":"26973202"}
