A soluble fragment of the EGFR extracellular domain can be detected in the blood of patients who have nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its prognostic role to the overall survival (OS) of these patients should be further elucidated. Methods:  PlasmaEGFR concentration was retrospectively determined using a commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay (BosterBio Inc. Pleasanton, CA). Plasma samples of 62 NSCLC patients before radiotherapy were obtained from University of Michigan and VA Ann Arbor Health System. Patients were seen in follow-up by a single physician every 3 months for the first 2 post-radiotherapy years, then every 6 months for 3 years and annually thereafter. Results:  A total of 62 patients (median age 63.6 years old; 41 male and 21 female) with stage I-III NSCLC were eligible. Median follow-up for surviving patient is 14 months. The plasma concentration of EGFR was 27.4  0.72 ng/ml (mean  standard error of mean) in 62 NSCLC patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 26-28.8). The median OS of 62 patients is 14 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.6-25.4). There was a significant correlation between plasma EGFR concentration and overall survival (OS) of these patients (R2 \u003d 0.14, p \u003d 0.0028). After the dichotomization of EGFR using an arbitrary cutoff concentration of 27.24 ng/ml (median), survival analysis showed that patients with lower plasma EGFR concentrations (\u003c 27.24 ng/ml) had a significant shorter OS compared with the patients who had higher plasma EGFR concentrations (\u003e 27.24 ng/ml) (18.2 m vs 33.4 m, p \u003d 0.021). Conclusion:  This study suggests that baseline plasma EGFR, if validated by an external study, may be used to predict survival in patients with NSCLC. Further study is ongoing to correlate the plasma level of EGFR with mutations in the tumor tissue.","title":"The plasma level of soluble epidermal growth factor Receptor (EGFR) and overall survival (OS) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_153580-156"}
