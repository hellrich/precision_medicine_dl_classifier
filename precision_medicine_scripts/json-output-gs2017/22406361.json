The distinction is important because surgical management and prognosis differ significantly. Several immunohistochemical markers have been evaluated to aid this diagnosis, but aside from N-cadherin, which labels cholangiocarcinoma, few provide the combination of good sensitivity and specificity. Our laboratory recently developed the novel monoclonal antibody human pancreatic cancer fusion #2 (HPC2) that recognizes pancreatic cancer. We hypothesized that the combination of our new marker and N-cadherin can assist in distinguishing metastatic pancreatic cancer from cholangiocarcinoma. We immunostained resections of 60 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and 31 cholangiocarcinomas for the HPC2 and N-cadherin antigens. We also stained 24 gallbladder adenocarcinomas, 11 ampullary adenocarcinomas, and 10 metastatic colonic adenocarcinomas to the liver. Sections were independently scored by 2 pathologists with good agreement using both markers (Îº statistics, 0.62-0.64; P \u003c .0001). HPC2 was observed in 80% of pancreatic cancers (48/60), 82% of ampullary (9/11), and 32% (10/31) of cholangiocarcinomas. N-cadherin stained 27% (16/60) of the pancreas cases and 58% (18/31) of the cholangiocarcinomas. Gallbladder and colon cancers were usually double negative (18/24 and 8/10, respectively). Each marker provided significant likelihood ratios to separate pancreatic cancer (HPC2, 2.48 [1.46-4.19]; P \u003c .0001) from cholangiocarcinoma (N-cadherin, 2.17 [1.3-3.64]; P \u003c .01). The combination of both markers provided even better specificity and positive likelihood ratios. We conclude that HPC2 and N-cadherin significantly improve accurate classification of pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"The novel monoclonal antibody HPC2 and N-cadherin distinguish pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"22406361"}
