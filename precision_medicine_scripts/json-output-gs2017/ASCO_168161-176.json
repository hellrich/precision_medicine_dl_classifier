Methods: We included 197 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary carcinoma between 2002 and 2014. Demographics, clinical features, treatment and outcome/survival were analyzed. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 60 years. The most common presenting symptom was jaundice (60%). Lymph node involvement was observedin 46% of thepatients. Sixty-six percent of patients had stage II-III disease.Perineural and lymphovascular invasion was seen in 50 (29.4%) and 69(40%) patients, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 63.4 and 40.9 months, respectively. mDFS was significantly lower in the patients with lymphovascular invasion (mDFS, 27 \u0026 108.5 p \u003c 0.001) and lymph node involvement (28.8 \u0026 67.8 p \u003d 0.027). Potential predictors of decreased survival on univariate analysis included age  50(mOS, 78.8 \u0026 53.1 p \u003d 0.045), poor performance status(108.5 \u0026 46 p \u003d 0.048), weight loss (38.8 \u0026 108.5 p \u003d 0.045), T3-T4 tumor (108.5 \u0026 19.3 p \u003d 0.018), microscopic positive margin (20.1 \u0026 78.8 p \u003d 0.01), lymph node involvement (38.8 \u0026 141.9 p \u003d 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (36.9 \u0026 not reached (NR)p \u003c 0.001), perineural invasion (39.2 \u0026 108.8 p \u003d 0.007), and poor histological grade (NR \u002636.9 p \u003d 0.042). In the multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR,1.98; P \u003d 0.028) and surgical margin (HR,2.61; P \u003d 0.03) were associated with overall survival.While 70.1% of the patients recieved chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, 29.9% of the patients didnt have any adjuvant therapy. There was no survival difference between the patients without any adjuvant therapies and with an adjuvant therapy (53.1 \u0026 108.5 P \u003d 0.166) Conclusions: Even though ampullary carcinoma has the best prognosis among all periampullary carcinomas, its long-term survival remain slow. Nodal status and surgical margin were an independent predictor of OS for patients with ampullary carcinoma. Additional studies are necessary to specify the role of adjuvant therapy of ampullary carcinomas.","title":"Clinicopathologic analysis and prognostic factors for survival in early stage patients with ampullary carcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_168161-176"}
