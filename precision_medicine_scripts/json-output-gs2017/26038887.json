Data about specific KRAS mutations for 331 patients who underwent hepatic resection for CRLM at Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2003 and 2013 were analyzed. Clinicopathological characteristics, perioperative details, and outcomes were stratified by specific KRAS mutation at codons 12 and 13.\nResection of CRLM.\nOverall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival.\nA mutated KRAS (mtKRAS) was identified in 91 patients (27.5%). At a median follow-up of 27.4 months, recurrence was observed in 48 patients (52.7%) with mtKRAS and 130 patients (54.2%) with wild-type KRAS (wtKRAS) (P \u003d .82). Median and 5-year survival among patients with mtKRAS was 32.4 months and 32.7%, respectively, vs 58.5 months and 46.9%, respectively, for patients with wtKRAS (P \u003d .02). Patients with KRAS codon 12 mutations had worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% CI, 1.05-2.27; P \u003d .03) vs those with wtKRAS, whereas a KRAS codon 13 mutation was not associated with prognosis (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.83-2.62; P \u003d .19). Among the 6 most common mutations in codons 12 and 13, only G12V (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.00-3.17; P \u003d .05) and G12S (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.22-9.10; P \u003d .02) were associated with worse OS compared with patients with wtKRAS (both P \u003c .05). Among patients who recurred, G12V (HR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.32-6.61; P \u003d .01), G12C (HR, 6.74; 95% CI, 2.05-22.2; P \u003d .002), and G12S mutations (HR, 4.91; 95% CI, 1.52-15.8; P \u003d .01) were associated with worse OS (both P \u003c .05).\nG12V and G12S mutations of codon 12 were independent prognostic factors of worse OS. Among patients who recurred after resection of CRLM, G12V, G12C, and G12S mutations were associated with worse OS. Information on specific KRAS mutations may help individualize therapeutic and surveillance strategies for patients with resected CRLM.","title":"Association Between Specific Mutations in KRAS Codon 12 and Colorectal Liver Metastasis.","pubmedId":"26038887"}
