PSC was the associated risk factor in 8/13 (61.5%) whereas PSC was present in only 321/2,014 (15.9%) cases with cholangiocarcinoma in patients older than 25 (P \u003c 0.0001) seen in the same period of time. Seven of the eight (88%) patients with cholangiocarcinoma and PSC had IBD and 5 of the 7 (71%) had Crohn\u0027s disease. A mean 11 months transplant free survival was observed (range 3-20 months) in cholangiocarcinoma with PSC versus 8 months in cholangiocarcinoma patients without PSC (NS).\nCholangiocarcinoma is a rare disorder in young adults and it seems not to exist in children. The youth group of cholangiocarcinoma plus PSC seems to have a higher prevalence of Crohn\u0027s disease whereas the prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma in youth seems to be similarly poor as described in older patients with cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Cholangiocarcinoma in young individuals with and without primary sclerosing cholangitis.","pubmedId":"17433022"}
