Intensity of epithelial staining of PTEN immunoreactivity in different histologic types was determined.\nAbsence of PTEN protein expression was detected in 60% of endometrial carcinoma, 60% of atypical endometrial hyperplasia, and 24% of typical endometrial hyperplasia. In endometrial hyperplasia without atypia group, the majority of cases revealed moderate to strong PTEN expression, with 70% in simple hyperplasia and 47% in complex hyperplasia. There is a significant statistical difference of PTEN immunoreactivity among proliferative endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma group (p \u003d 0.004).\nComplete loss of PTEN protein expression was most commonly found in endometrial carcinoma and hyperplasia with cytologic atypia.","title":"Detection of PTEN immunoreactivity in endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18788685"}
