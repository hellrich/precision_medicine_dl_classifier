DMBT-1 plays a role in mucosal immune defence.\nThe expression of DMBT-1 was examined immunohistochemically in biliary epithelial cells in hepatolithiasis (n \u003d 25), invasive and non-invasive cholangiocarcinoma associated with hepatolithiasis (n \u003d 52), IPN-L with hepatolithiasis (n \u003d 49), cholangiocarcinoma without hepatolithiasis (n \u003d 32), and 10 normal control livers. DMBT-1 was expressed more frequently in the biliary epithelia of hepatolithiasis when compared with normal livers (P \u003c 0.05). DMBT-1 expression was also frequent in IPN-L (57%) and non-invasive cholangiocarcinoma (79%). By contrast, DMBT-1 was decreased in invasive cholangiocarcinoma with and without hepatolithiasis (50% and 30%, respectively) (P \u003c 0.05). The homozygous deletion of the DMBT-1 gene was recognized in four (20%) of 20 cholangiocarcinoma tissues and two (50%) of four cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, corresponding to the reduction of DMBT-1 expression. No deletion was detected in hepatolithiasis tissues.\nDMBT-1 expression is increased in IPN-L and non-invasive cholangiocarcinoma as well as in biliary epithelia in hepatolithiasis. Decreased expression of DMBT-1 and homozygous deletion of the DMBT-1 gene in invasive cholangiocarcinoma suggest that they occur in the late stage of cholangiocarcinogenesis.","title":"Decrease of deleted in malignant brain tumour-1 (DMBT-1) expression is a crucial late event in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"14511252"}
