The patient presented to the hospital with fever, nausea, and right flank pain. His medical history was significant for diabetes and an adrenal mass that was detected 6Â years prior to presentation during a computed tomography (CT) scan for trauma secondary to a motor vehicle collision. The mass was thought to be a myelolipoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 12-cm right adrenal mass that was considered suspicious for carcinoma, which was surgically excised and cultured intraoperatively. The cultures subsequently grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Grossly, the adrenal mass was an encapsulated, necrotic lesion with surrounding areas of fat necrosis. On histologic examination, the tissue showed sheets of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells diffusely involving the adrenal gland along with bright yellow lipofuscin crystals in a background of necrosis and fibrosis.
