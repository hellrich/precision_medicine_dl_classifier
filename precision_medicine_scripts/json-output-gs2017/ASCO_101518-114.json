Deletion of CDKN2A locus is frequently seen in ALL, although prognostic significance remains unclear.  Methods:  Retrospective chart review at Mayo Clinic between 8/2005-11/2011 was performed on adult B-ALL patients (pts) who underwent fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies at diagnosis. Survival estimate was calculated using Kaplan-Meier statistics. Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as time between diagnosis and induction failure, relapse, or death, while overall survival (OS) as time between diagnosis and death  Results:  Out of 27 pts who had FISH studies for CDKN2A, 15 (56%) pts had CDKN2A deletions (8 homozygous/7 hemizygous), while 12 (44%) pts had diploid cytogenetics (none had abnormalities of MLL, bcr/abl fusion or CDKN2A deletion on FISH). There was no significant difference in median age, gender, WBC, hemoglobin, platelet count, LDH or complete remission (CR) rate (p\u003d0.924) between the two groups. CDKN2A-deleted pts had higher circulating blasts (34% vs 16%, p\u003d0.017). Of 13 CDKN2A-deleted pts, chromosome 9p was intact in 9 (69%) pts using routine cytogenetics. In the CDKN2A-deleted group, allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) was performed in 7 (47%) pts at first CR and 1 at second CR. Four of 15 (27%) CDKN2A-deleted pts also had bcr/abl fusion. Five-year EFS was poorer in CDKN2A-deleted pts compared to normal FISH group (22% vs 60%, p\u003d0.042), while 5-year OS was 72% vs 60% (p\u003d0.308), respectively. Excluding the 4 bcr/abl fusion pts, 5-year EFS was still statistically significant (p\u003d0.008). In the CDKN2A deleted group, both 5-yr EFS (80% vs 0%, p\u003d0.006) and OS (100% vs 42%, p\u003d0.016) were significantly superior in pts who received ASCT.  Conclusions:  CDKN2A deletions predict earlier relapse in pts with B-ALL. Majority of 9p abnormalities were only found by FISH testing and missed by conventional cytogenetics. In CDKN2A deleted pts, ASCT gave overall survival advantage. Further investigation through larger cohorts of pts is needed to validate these findings.","title":"CDKN2A-deletion to predict relapse in adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).","pubmedId":"ASCO_101518-114"}
