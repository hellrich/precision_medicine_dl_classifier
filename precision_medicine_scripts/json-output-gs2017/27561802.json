Crizotinib had been confirmed to be used in ROS1 (C-ros oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase) rearranged lung adenocarcinoma, but its efficacy in lung cancer with brain metastasis was poor due to the blood brain barrier. In the present study, we reported one case of ROS1 fusion lung adenocarcinoma with symptomatic brain matastasis, who was treated with brain metastases resection, crizotinib, and whole brain radiotherapy plus boost to residual brain metastasis. The safety and efficacy was summarized.\nAt first, surgical resection was used to relive mass effect and to biopsy. Then crizotinib (250 mg, bid) was chosen for the existence of ROS1 fusion gene. Whole brain radiotherapy plus boost to residual brain metastasis were used after surgery. Objective response was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteriation in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 and brain metastasis were evaluated by computer tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image. Adverse events were evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC AE) v4.0.\nAfter taking crizotinib for 3 months, the lung lesions were close to complete response (CR), the brain metastasis were partial response (PR), the abdomen metastasis were CR and the symptom of blurred vision relieved.\nCrizotinib combined with palliative operation and radiation therapy (WBRT plus boost to residual brain metastasis) in the treatment of ROS1 fusion gene positive lung adenocarcinoma with symptomatic brain metastases, can effectively control intracranial lesions with good tolerance.\n背景与目的 伴有脑转移的肺癌预后差。克唑替尼可有效治疗ROS1（C-ros oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase）融合基因阳性的肺癌，但由于血脑屏障通透率较低，对脑转移灶的治疗效果不佳。本文总结1例综合运用手术、全脑放疗+残留灶补量放疗及克唑替尼等手段治疗ROS1融合基因阳性伴有症状脑转移的肺腺癌患者，并对其有效性及安全性进行讨论和分析。 方法 采用手术切除占位效应明显、引起头疼症状的颅内病灶，获得病理；因ROS1融合基因阳性，给予克唑替尼治疗，250 mg，2次/d；术后进行全脑放疗+残留灶补量放疗。按照实体瘤疗效评价标准1.1版（Response Evaluation Criteriation in Solid Tumours, RECIST v1.1）评价客观疗效。按照不良反应通用术语标准4.0版（ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0, CTC AE v4.0）评估用药期间发生的不良事件。 结果 该患者服用克唑替尼3个月后，肺部病变接近完全缓解（complete remission, CR），颅内病变部分缓解（partial response, PR），腹腔病变CR，视物模糊症状减轻。 结论 综合运用手术、全脑放疗+残留灶补量放疗、克唑替尼治疗ROS1融合基因阳性伴有症状脑转移的肺腺癌患者，可有效控制颅内颅外病灶，耐受性好。.","title":"[Crizotinib Treatment Combined with Resection and Whole-brain Radiation Therapy \u2029in A ROS1 Rearranged Lung Adenocarcinoma with Brain Metastasis: \u2029Case Report and Literature Review].","pubmedId":"27561802"}
