By fibrobronchoscopy with its matched injecting needle, carboplatin 300 mg were injected into the centre of the tumor and the surroundings, combined with the routine carboplatin and etoposide (CE) regimen. While the control group was treated only by intravenous chemotherapy with the routine CE regimen.\nIn the 20 patients with local chemotherapy by fibrobronchoscopy combined with intravenous chemotherapy, 7 cases (35%) were completely cured and 11 cases (55%) showed partial recovery, other 2 cases without change. The 90% effective rate was significantly higher than 55% of the control group (P \u003c 0.05).\nThe local chemotherapy by fibrobronchoscopy can remarkably reduce the size of tumor, and relieve symptom of dyspnea. Intravenous chemotherapy alleviated the obstruction caused by tracheal or bronchial neoplasms. The combined therapies led to much better therapeutic effect and symptomatic relief than those by the routine CE regimen.","title":"[Local chemotherapy by fibrobronchoscopy for advanced bronchogenic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"11778530"}
