Gain or loss of function due to missense mutations in FGFR1 is responsible for a variety of disorders including Kallmann syndrome, Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, etc. The mutant model of the human FGFR1 protein was subjected to various in silico analysis, and most deleterious SNPs were screened out. Furthermore, docking and long molecular dynamics simulations were carried out with an intention of studying the possible impact of these mutations on the protein structure and hence its function. Analysis of various structural properties-especially of those of the functionally important regions: the extracellular immunoglobulin domain and intracellular Tyrosine kinase domain-gave some insights into the possible structural characteristics of the disease mutant and the wild-type forms of the protein. In a nutshell, compared to the wild-type protein, the mutant structures V273M and S685F are associated with significant changes, and the functionally important regions seem to adopt such structures that are not conducive for the wild-type-like functionality.","title":"Disease-causing mutation in extracellular and intracellular domain of FGFR1 protein: computational approach.","pubmedId":"23329143"}
