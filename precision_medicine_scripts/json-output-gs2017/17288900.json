We describe 2 cases in which a primary tumor was found in the explanted lung--1 case of adenocarcinoma in a patient with pulmonary emphysema and 1 case of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Both patients died due to the recurrence of the neoplastic disease. Distant metastasis was the initial manifestation of the recurrence.","title":"[Lung transplantation: bronchogenic carcinoma in the native lung].","pubmedId":"17288900"}
