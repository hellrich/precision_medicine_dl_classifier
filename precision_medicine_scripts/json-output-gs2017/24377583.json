A wide range of variation in frequency of KRAS mutations has been seen in hematologic malignancies. Despite this, RAS roles in leukemogenesis remain unclear. The frequency of KRAS mutations in CML has been reported to be between zero an 10%. Many attempts have been done to develop an anti-RAS drug as a therapeutic target. .\nThis cross sectional study was performed in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran from 2010-2012. In 78 CML patients (diagnosed according to WHO 2008 criteria) in chronic or accelerated phases, KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 were analyzed using a modified PCR- restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method.\nWe did not detect any KRAS mutations in this study.\nKRAS mutations are overall rare in early phase CML and might be secondary events happening late in leukemogenesis cooperating with initial genetic lesions.","title":"Lack of KRAS gene mutations in chronic myeloid leukemia in Iran.","pubmedId":"24377583"}
