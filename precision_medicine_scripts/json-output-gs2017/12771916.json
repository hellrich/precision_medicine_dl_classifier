We previously reported that MK mRNA expression is elevated in neuroblastoma specimens at all stages, whereas pleiotrophin, the other member of the MK family, is expressed at high levels in favourable neuroblastomas. As MK is a secretory protein, it can be detected in the blood. Here, we show a significant correlation of the plasma MK level with prognostic factors of neuroblastomas. The plasma MK level was determined in 220 patients with neuroblastomas, and compared with that in children without malignant tumors (n\u003d17, \u003c500 pg ml(-1)). The plasma MK level became significantly elevated with advancing stages (stage 1: 445 pg ml(-1) (median), n\u003d73; stage 2: 589, n\u003d39; stage 3: 864, n\u003d40; stage 4: 1445, n\u003d56; and stage 4S: 2439, n\u003d12). More importantly, a higher MK level was strongly correlated with poor prognostic factors: over 1 year of age (P\u003d0.0299), MYCN amplification (P\u003c0.0001), low TrkA expression (P\u003d0.0005), nonmass screening, sporadic neuroblastomas (P\u003c0.0001), and diploidy/tetraploidy (P\u003d0.0007). Thus, these results demonstrate that the plasma MK level is a good marker for evaluating the progression of neuroblastomas. Moreover, considering the ability of antisense MK oligodeoxyribonucleotide to suppress tumour growth of colorectal carcinoma cells in nude mice, as recently reported, the present study suggests that MK is a possible candidate molecular target for therapy for neuroblastomas.","title":"Correlation of elevated level of blood midkine with poor prognostic factors of human neuroblastomas.","pubmedId":"12771916"}
