This applies for patients who are treated non-surgically and those who undergo curative pancreatic cancer resection. This review article summarizes relevant studies addressing pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in pancreatic cancer, with particular differentiation between non-surgically and surgically treated patients, as well as between the different surgeries. We also summarize studies addressing pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in pancreatic cancer.
