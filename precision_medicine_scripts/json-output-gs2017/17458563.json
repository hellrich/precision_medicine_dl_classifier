Median follow-up time was 26 months.\nThe estimated 3-year progression-free survival (PFS; calculated from the date of the start of IM) was 54% and median PFS was 40.5 months. The following factors significantly and negatively influenced PFS in univariate analysis: poor baseline World Health Organization (WHO) performance status \u003e or \u003d 2 (P \u003c 0.00001), tumor genotype indicating other than KIT exon 11 isoform (P \u003d 0.005), baseline high neutrophils count (P \u003c 0.00001), age \u003c45 years at the diagnosis (P \u003d 0.04), mitotic index \u003e10/50 high-power fields (HPF) (P \u003d 0.001), GIST histological type other than spindle-cell (P \u003d 0.03), baseline low albumin level (P \u003d 0.0005), low baseline hemoglobin level (P \u003c 0.00001), and primary overtly malignant tumors (unresectable and/or metastatic lesions at presentation) (P \u003d 0.05). We identified four factors negatively affecting PFS, statistically significant (P \u003c 0.05) in multivariate analysis: baseline poor WHO performance status \u003e or \u003d 2, high baseline neutrophils count (\u003e5 x 10(9)/l), tumor genotype indicating the presence of non-exon 11 KIT mutant and mitotic index \u003e10/50 HPF.\nWe confirmed that many advanced GIST patients benefit from IM therapy for a prolonged time, although resistance to therapy is observed. We identified four independent biological factors influencing the PFS during long-term IM therapy.","title":"Predictive factors for long-term effects of imatinib therapy in patients with inoperable/metastatic CD117(+) gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).","pubmedId":"17458563"}
