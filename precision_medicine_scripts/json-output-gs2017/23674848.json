The survival rates of the patients were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test, χ² test and Cox proportional hazards model were used to determine the relationships between CA II, Ki-67 and CD117 expression and prognostic value in GISTs.\nThe survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 90.0%, 82.0% and 72.0% in all patients. However, in patients with positive CA II or Ki-67, the survival rates were 92.0%, 83.0% and 77.0% or 83.0%, 66.6% and 53.0%, respectively. Compared with the negative groups, the survival rates in the positive groups were significantly lower (CA II log-rank P \u003d 0.000; Ki-67 log-rank P \u003d 0.004). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that CA II, CD117 and Ki-67 were considerable immune factors in prognosis of GIST patients (CA II P \u003d 0.043; CD117 P \u003d 0.042; Ki-67 P \u003d 0.007). Besides, tumor diameter, mitotic rate, tumor site, depth of invasion, complete resection, intraoperative rupture, and adjuvant therapy were important prognosis predictive factors. Our study indicated that CA II had strong expression in GISTs and the prognosis of GISTs with high CA II expression was better than that of GISTs with low or no expression, suggesting that CA II is both a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for GIST.\nCA II and Ki-67 are significant prognostic factors for GISTs. CA II associated with neovascular endothelia could serve as a potential target for cancer therapy.","title":"Overexpression of carbonic anhydrase II and Ki-67 proteins in prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"23674848"}
