Incidence density and cumulative incidence of cardiac toxicities were calculated, and the time-to-event (cardiac toxicity) analysis was conducted by using the Cox hazard regression model.\nThe excess cumulative incidence of congestive heart failure in Year 10 among patients receiving anthracycline-containing chemotherapy compared with patients without chemotherapy was 4.7% (31.9% vs 27.2%). After adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics, patients receiving anthracyclines were 25% more likely to have congestive heart failure compared with those without chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.46). Those receiving other agents did not have a significantly elevated risk of developing congestive heart failure. The adjusted risk of cardiomyopathy was 2-fold higher in women who received anthracyclines (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.44-2.62) and was 16% higher in those receiving other agents (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.97-1.39) compared with those without chemotherapy. The increased risk for developing congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac dysrhythmias in association with chemotherapy were similar after adjusting for hypertension and diabetes. The risk of ischemic heart disease and conduction disorders were not significantly different among the 3 groups.\nAnthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens were associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac dysrhythmias, but not significantly associated with ischemic heart disease or conduction disorders.","title":"Cardiac toxicity associated with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy in older women with breast cancer.","pubmedId":"19672997"}
