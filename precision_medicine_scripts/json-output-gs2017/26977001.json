The present study aimed at the elucidation of the role of KRAS mutation in prediction of outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC receiving second- or third-line chemotherapy.\nThe outcome of 127 patients with advanced NSCLC who recieved pemetrexed or docetaxel at second- or third-line therapy was retrospectively analyzed.\nProgression-free survival was not significantly different between patients with KRAS mutation and those with wild-type KRAS. The results were the same even when taking into account the specific KRAS mutation. Overall survival was significantly longer for patients with wild-type KRAS vs. those with KRAS mutation (16.1 vs. 7.2 months, p\u003d0,008). We observed shorter overall survival for those with G12C KRAS mutation vs. other KRAS mutations (median 10.3 vs. 6.4 months, p\u003d0.011).\nThe presence of KRAS mutation (especially KRAS G12C mutation) correlated with adverse prognosis in patients treated with second- or third-line pemetrexed or docetaxel.","title":"The Prognostic Role of KRAS Mutation in Patients with Advanced NSCLC Treated with Second- or Third-line Chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"26977001"}
