However, there have been no clinical reports in lung cancer patients that compare the time-to-response between radiotherapy and EGFR-TKIs.\nWe reviewed 17 and 32 consecutive patients with inoperable stage III/IV NSCLC who harbored sensitive EGFR mutations and who were treated with thoracic radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and EGFR-TKIs, respectively.\nThere were statistically significant differences in time-to-partial response (PR) with regard to the treatment modalities (radiotherapy vs. EGFR-TKIs, median 57 days vs. 22 days, log-rank test, p\u003d0.008).\nEGFR-TKIs elicit tumor shrinkage earlier than does radiotherapy in patients with a sensitive EGFR mutation, suggesting that EGFR-TKIs may be useful for early symptom improvement in these patients.","title":"Comparison of the time-to-response between radiotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor--tyrosine kinase inhibitors for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation.","pubmedId":"23898092"}
