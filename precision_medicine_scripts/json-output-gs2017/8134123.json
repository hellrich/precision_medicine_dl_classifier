This chromosomal region has previously been found to include a number of growth-related genes including the GLI proto-oncogene and the p53-associated protein, MDM2. We now report the characterization of SAS (sarcoma amplified sequence), a novel transcript found in this region. Sequence analysis demonstrates that SAS is a novel member of a transmembrane protein family (transmembrane 4 superfamily or TM4SF) thought to be involved in growth-related cellular processes. This observation adds a TM4SF protein to the cluster of genes at 12q13-14 frequently amplified in human sarcomas.","title":"SAS, a gene amplified in human sarcomas, encodes a new member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily of proteins.","pubmedId":"8134123"}
