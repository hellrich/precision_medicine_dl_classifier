Tumors with activating EGFR mutations areexquisitely sensitive to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)gefitinib and erlotinib; hence the use of adjuvant TKIs may moreeffectively prevent recurrences. This trial investigates the safety andefficacy of adjuvant erlotinib in pts with stage I-IIIA NSCLC andsomatic EGFR mutations. Methods: Eligible pts havesurgically resected stage IA-IIIA NSCLC and activating EGFR mutations.Within 6 months of surgery, and following the completion of routineadjuvant treatment, pts are treated with 150 mg/day of erlotinib for atotal of 2 years, with surveillance scans every 6 months. The primaryendpoint is disease-free survival at 2 years. Results:Thirty-six pts were enrolled at five sites between 1/08 and 11/09.Demographics include: stage I 53%; stage II 19%; stage IIIA 28%; female75%; never-smokers 56%; exon 19 deletion 61%, L858R 36%. Significanttoxicities are listed below (Table). 6 pts have been dose reduced to100 mg/day and 4 additional pts to 50 mg/day for toxicities includingrash, fatigue, diarrhea, transaminitis, and hyperbilirubinemia. 5 ptshave withdrawn as a result of toxicity (n\u003d3) or patient preference(n\u003d2), mostly within the first month of treatment (n\u003d4). Currentaverage follow-up time is 8 months. Conclusions:Chronic treatment with adjuvant erlotinib in NSCLC pts with EGFRmutations is feasible. Major observed toxicities are consistent withthose previously reported for erlotinib. Based the demonstrated role ofEGFR TKIs in advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations, this trial has beenexpanded to accrue 100 total patients.ToxicitiesGradeand frequency (%)EventIIIIIIIVTotalRash333614-83Diarrhea5833-64Fatigue31176-53Alopecia1911--31Nausea/vomiting228--31Dryskin25---25Mucositis173--19Pruritis863-17Skinerythema116--17Ocular:dry eye, conjunctivitis88--17Nailchanges14---14AST/ALT6-3-8Bilirubin33--6Pneumonitis----0","title":"A multicenter phase II trial of adjuvant erlotinib in patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR): Toxicity evaluation.","pubmedId":"ASCO_42810-74"}
