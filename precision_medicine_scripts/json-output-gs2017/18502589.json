All six trials of adjuvant trastuzumab reported significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) while 4 of 6 adjuvant trials showed significant improvement in overall survival (OS) for patients treated with trastuzumab over those that were not. Two trials of trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting reported significantly better pathological complete response (pCR) in patients treated with trastuzumab although both studies were limited by small sample size, and longer follow-up is needed.\nAlthough the optimal duration, schedule, and timing of adjuvant trastuzumab remains undefined, the bulk of the available evidence supports that adjuvant trastuzumab be offered for 1 year to all patients with HER-2-positive and node-positive or high-risk node-negative (tumour \u003eor\u003d 1cm in size) primary breast cancer who are receiving or have received (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy.","title":"Adjuvant/neoadjuvant trastuzumab therapy in women with HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer: a systematic review.","pubmedId":"18502589"}
