The expression of p53 proteins was increased in pancreatic carcinoma (P \u003c 0.01), while the expression of p14(ARF) and p21(WAF/CIP1) proteins was reduced (P \u003c 0.05), as compared with that in non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue. p21(WAF/CIP1) protein expression in pancreatic carcinoma significantly correlated with the age of patients and perineural invasion (P \u003c 0.05). p53 protein expression correlated significantly with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and perineural invasion (P \u003c 0.05). Mdm2 protein expression correlated significantly with tumor differentiation (P \u003c 0.05), while p14(ARF) protein expression correlated significantly with the age of patients and metastasis (P \u003c 0.05). There was also statistic correlation between the expression of these four genes (P \u003c 0.05).\nOverexpression of p53 and mdm2 and loss of p14(ARF) and p21(WAF/CIP1) expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of pancreatic carcinoma. These proteins play a critical role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis after DNA damage through p14(ARF)-mdm2-p53-p21(WAF/CIP1) pathway. Detection of p53 and Mdm2 protein overexpression may be useful in evaluation of the aggressiveness of pancreatic carcinoma.","title":"[Expression of proteins in p53 (p14ARF-mdm2-p53-p21WAF/CIP1) pathway and their significance in exocrine pancreatic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"15132849"}
