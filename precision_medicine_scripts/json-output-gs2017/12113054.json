When confined to the prostate it can be cured by radical prostatectomy or irradiation therapy. However, there are no curative therapies for locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease. Prostate cancer gene therapy has recently transition from preclinical studies to clinical trials with the goal of developing novel treatments for prostate cancer. The greatest challenge in treating advanced prostate cancer is therapeutic access to and the elimination of metastases. This review details two aspects of prostate cancer gene therapy, the types of delivery systems under development and specific categories of therapeutic genes available with an emphasis on the mechanism of action of specific gene therapy strategies.","title":"Gene therapy for prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"12113054"}
