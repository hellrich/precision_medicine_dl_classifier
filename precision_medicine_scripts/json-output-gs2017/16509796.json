A 42-year-old male presented a 55 x 60-mm round, inhomogeneous, noninvasive mass of the left adrenal gland. Hormone-activity values were within normal range. The mass was removed laparoscopically en bloc along with the left adrenal gland, and its histopathologic evaluation was consistent with the features of a malignant melanocytic tumor. Postoperatively, the patient presented no signs of fever or remarkable blood loss and was discharged on the third day in good clinical condition. He is free of disease 1 year later.","title":"Case report: laparoscopic adrenalectomy in a patient with primary adrenal malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"16509796"}
