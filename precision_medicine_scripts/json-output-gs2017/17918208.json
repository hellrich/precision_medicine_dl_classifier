Because phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) regulates cell invasion, the objective of the current study was to determine if retinol affected PI3K activity. Following 24 h of serum starvation, the ATRA resistant human colon cancer cell lines HCT-116 and SW620 were treated with 0, 1, or 10 microM retinol. Thirty minutes of retinol treatment resulted in a significant decrease in PI3K activity in both cell lines. To determine the mechanism by which retinol reduces PI3K activity, the levels and heterodimerization of the regulatory subunit, p85, and the catalytic subunit, p110, of PI3K were examined. Retinol treatment did not alter p85 or p110 protein levels or the heterodimerization of these subunits at any time point examined. To determine if retinol affected the ability of PI3K to phosphorylate the substrate, phosphatidylinositol (PI), PI3K was immunoprecipitated from control cells and incubated with 10 microg PI and increasing concentrations of retinol or 10 microg retinol and increasing concentrations of PI. Retinol decreased PI3K activity in a dose-responsive manner and increased PI suppressed the inhibitory effect of retinol on PI3K activity. Finally, the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, mimicked the ability of retinol to decrease cell invasion. Computational modeling revealed that retinol may inhibit PI3K activity in a manner similar to that of wortmannin. Thus, a decrease in PI3K activity due to retinol treatment may confer the ability of retinol to inhibit ATRA-resistant colon cancer cell invasion.","title":"Retinol decreases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in colon cancer cells.","pubmedId":"17918208"}
