The aim of this study is to examine the difference in FUS2-767A/T polymorphism site between lung cancer patients and normal controls in Chinese population.\nThe genotype FUS2-767A/T was detected in 146 lung cancer patients and 113 normal controls by PCR-SSCP method. The relationship between lung cancer risk and difference in genotypes of FUS2 gene was analysed.\nFUS2-767A/T was significantly related to histological type (P\u003d0.044), age of the patients with lung cancer (P\u003d0.011) and vessel cancer embolus (P\u003d0.031) in lung cancer group. There was no significant difference in distribution of FUS2 genotypes between lung cancer patients and normal controls (P\u003d0.945).\nThe results suggest that the FUS2-767A/T polymorphism may be a susceptibility factor for lung cancer among Chinese population.","title":"[SNP767A/T of FUS2 gene and lung cancer risk in Chinese population].","pubmedId":"21176460"}
