Though most patients with EGFR activating mutation response to EGFR-TKI, there are still about 30% patients showing no response. miRNA expression is deregulated in lung cancer, and miRNAs can regulate EGFR. So it is important to predict the candidate miRNAs that target EGFR and to investigate the availability of these candidate miRNA regulators in lung cancer.  Methods:  In this study, we investigated the miRNA expression in lung adenocarcinomas cell lines with mutated EGFR (H1650 and PC-9)and wild-type EGFR (H1299 and A549) using the Phalanx Human Whole Genome Microarray.  Results:  The expression of 1,732 miRNAs was evaluated and expression of individual miRNAs was validated by individual RT-PCR assays. Overall, miRNAs expression were different between these two groups. Hsa-let-7d-3p, hsa-miR-1307-5p, hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-203, hsa-miR-3182, hsa-miR-4510, hsa-miR-934 were upregulated and hsa-miR-3196, hsa-miR-4450, hsa-miR-4649-5p were downregulated in the mutated EGFR group.  Conclusions:  It is suggested that there are different carcinogenic pathways for EGFR mutation tumors. Those miRNAs that associated EGFR mutation can be further explored for their application in target therapy and prognostics.","title":"Association of miRNA expression and EGFR mutation status in lung adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"ASCO_113386-132"}
