Pancreatic calculi are the hallmark for the diagnosis. We report a 32-year-old male patient, a known case of diabetes since 2 years, presented with recurrent pain abdomen, malabsorption, and neuropathic symptoms. The diagnosis was established on the basis of clinical examination, biochemical and radiological investigations. He was prescribed two doses of premix insulin and pancreatic enzyme supplements for relief of abdominal pain and steatorrhea.
