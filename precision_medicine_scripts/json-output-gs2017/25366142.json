This study was designed to well define the relationship between SNP rs2279744 and sarcoma risk. We did a systematic computerized search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases to identify the human case-control studies investigating the relationship between SNP rs2279744 and sarcoma risk with complete genetic data. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model or the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model to estimate the risk of sarcoma. Overall analysis included five independent studies. On the whole, the T/G genotype or the combined G/G and T/G genotypes appeared to be associated with approximately 1.40-fold higher risk of sarcoma relative to the T/T genotype (T/G vs. T/T: OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00-1.77; G/G + T/G vs. T/T: OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08-1.85). We noted that the Caucasian populations showed a similarly increased risk of sarcoma ascribed to the carriage of the same genotypes (T/G vs. T/T: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.90; G/G + T/G vs. T/T: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.13-1.97). This meta-analysis provides evidence that MDM2 SNP rs2279744 may be significantly associated with increased risk of sarcoma in Caucasian individuals.","title":"Impact of MDM2 gene polymorphism on sarcoma risk.","pubmedId":"25366142"}
