Methods: Since January 2002 to June 2005, 107 women with breast cancer and 108 control subjects were recruited. A sensitive SYBR green methylation-specific PCR quantitative technique was used to analyze the utility of circulating DNA with CpG island hypermethylation of APC, RAR-, E-Cadherin, ESR1 and 14-3-3 gene promoter regions as breast cancer biomarkers. Sera were collected in 107 operable breast cancer patients (pts) previously surgery and in 60 of those pts after treatment. Respect controls, 34 had benign breast disease and 74 with no evidence of breast disease. Results: Mean serum values of methylated ESR1 and 14-3-3 gene promoters significantly differed between breast cancer patients and healthy controls (p \u003d 0.0112 for ESR1 and p \u003d 0.0047 for 14-3-3-). When their results were combined, it was found that hypermethylation of these two genes differentiated between breast cancer patients and healthy controls (p  0.0001) with a sensitivity of 81% (95% confidence interval: 72-88%) and specificity of 88% (95%CI:78-94%). Presence of methylated ESR1 in serum of breast cancer patients was associated with ER-negative phenotype (p \u003d 0.0179); and presence of methylated 14-3-3- was associated with T3-4 stage (OMS; p \u003c 0.05) and nodal positive status (p \u003c 0.05). We observed lower methylated ERS1 or 14-3-3- values after surgery, respect pretreatment levels, but without an overall statistically significant difference. With a median follow-up of 6 years, we found that patients with a significant decrease of sera methylated levels of both genes after surgery had better time to progression an overall survival respect patients without this observation. Conclusions: These results also suggest that this panel of genes detected in ductal lavage and blood specimens could be useful to biomarkers for early detection breast cancer. Although numerous issues remain to be resolved, the quantitative measurement of circulating methylated DNA is a promising tool for cancer risk assessment.","title":"Aberrant methylation in breast cancer and correlates with tumor phenotypes, prognostic factors, and patient outcome.","pubmedId":"ASCO_60609-100"}
