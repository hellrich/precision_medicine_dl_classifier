The adjustment of food intake as well as the pleasure of eating are the results of the circulation of neurotransmitters, hormones and glucocorticoids which have an ability to regulate the activity of many receptors connected with G protein, including endocannabinoid receptors. The key role of endocannabinoids in pathogenesis of obesity is their overproduction by adipose cells. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) affect CB1 receptors and increase hunger, willingness to intake food, decrease peristalsis and delay stomach emptying. In obese people increased levels of both central and peripheral endocannabinoids are observed. It may be connected with higher availability of endocannabinoid precursors to synthesis from adipose tissue and lipids. Raised concentration of eCBs in the body may be the consequence of their catabolism dysfunction. There is a positive correlation between amount the number of receptors in the peripheral tissues and obesity increase. It is thought that expression of CB1 receptors in mesolimbic system is connected with motivation to consume food in response to rewarding factor. The appetite increase after cannabinoids use is probably caused by rewarding action of the consumed food and it results from excessive dopaminergic transmission in award system. The pharmacological inhibition of endocannabinoids activity leads to weight loss, but may also have negative consequences such as decreased mood, reduced tolerance of pain, intensified anxiety, anhedonia, depressive symptoms, even suicidal thoughts. In post mortem examinations a decrease in CB1 receptor density in grey matter of glial cells in patients with major depression was identified. The pleiotropic and extensive activity of endocannabinoid system can influence a range of neurotransmitters thereby modulating the psychiatric life phenomena, simultaneously being involved in metabolism control and energetic system of human body. Hence it is a link between metabolic disorders and depression and anxiety disorders. Therefore, in obese people depressive comorbidity is higher and it significantly worsens prognosis and decreases life quality.
