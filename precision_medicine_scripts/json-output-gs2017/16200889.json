Echocardiography showed a huge vegetation attached to the posterior mitral leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation. Blood culture identified Streptococcus galactiae. The serum level of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) was elevated at 199.4 U/ml. Resection of infected tissue including mobile vegetation and replacement of mitral valve were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy. The values of CA125 returned to normal (less than 15 U/ml) on the 90th postoperative day. These findings have suggested that a high serum value of CA125 is a possible indicator of infection-related congestive heart failure.","title":"Normalization of cancer antigen 125 after mitral valve replacement in a patient with congestive heart failure due to mitral valve endocarditis.","pubmedId":"16200889"}
