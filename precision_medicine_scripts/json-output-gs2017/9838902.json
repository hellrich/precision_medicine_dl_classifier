Amplifications of K-sam and c-met genes are often associated with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, while ERBB2 genes are amplified in well--differentiated adenocarcinomas of the stomach. Alterations of tumor suppressor regulators confer progression of gastric cancer. On the other hand, multi autocrine loops of growth factors/receptors in gastric cancer cells play a key role in the progression and metastasis of cancer cells. The overexpression of K-sam gene, occurs in 31.9% of gastric cancers, and the prognosis of patients with overexpression of K-sam gene is poorer than those without it. Multivariate analysis reveals that the overexpression of K-sam gene is an important factor for prognosis, lymphnode metastasis and the depth of tumor invasion of gastric carcinomas.","title":"[New molecular prognostic markers in gastric carcinoma].","pubmedId":"9838902"}
