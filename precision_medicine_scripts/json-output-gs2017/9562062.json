Clonorchiasis is a trematodiasis caused by chronic infestation of liver flukes, which are largely confined to the Orient, from Japan to Vietnam. The close relationship between clonorchiasis and cholangiocarcinoma has long been emphasized. This paper discusses the efficacy and possible roles of MRI for imaging clonorchiasis and cholangiocarcinoma of the liver. Although sonography, CT, and direct cholangiography have been used traditionally to diagnose these diseases, the role of MRI has been increasing rapidly with dramatic progress of the MRI techniques. We review MRI findings of clonorchiasis and cholangiocarcinoma and discuss the potential usefulness of MRI.","title":"MRI of clonorchiasis and cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"9562062"}
