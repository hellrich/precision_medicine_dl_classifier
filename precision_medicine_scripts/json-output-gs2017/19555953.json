Two patients experienced postoperative complications: an iliac lymphocyst with pyelectasis, and a vaginal evisceration that occurred during sexual intercourse. Nine patients required no further treatment. One patient with residual disease received brachytherapy as adjuvant treatment. Two patients with positive nodes not detected at preoperative work-up received adjuvant concomitant radiochemotherapy.\nTLRP with pelvic lymphadenectomy is a safe and feasible treatment in patients with occult invasive cervical cancer discovered after extrafascial hysterectomy.","title":"Total laparoscopic radical parametrectomy, partial colpectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients with occult cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"19555953"}
