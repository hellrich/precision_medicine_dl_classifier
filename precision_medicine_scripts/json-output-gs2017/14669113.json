Radical resection with negative histologic margins offers the best chance for long-term survival. The decision regarding the appropriate surgical approach is challenging due to the complexity of tumor localization and neighboring vascular structures. Aggressive resection demands extended liver resection, which is associated with the risk of postoperative liver failure. However, even limited surgery such as hilar resection can be curative and leads to long-term survival in individual cases. The principles of surgical oncology have led to more aggressive procedures, including the combination of liver transplantation and multivisceral resection, and can be performed with calculable morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, the high risk of tumor recurrence under long-term immunosuppression, the limited availability of donor organs and the excellent results of liver transplantation in non-malignant diseases do not justify this procedure at present. Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy has failed to demonstrate major benefit. In patients with irresectable tumor or distant metastases palliative measures are aimed at restoring an unobstructed bile flow with endoscopic placement of metal stents. Palliative treatment with additional radio- or photodynamic therapy may be considered in individual cases.","title":"[Surgical treatment for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin\u0027s tumor)].","pubmedId":"14669113"}
