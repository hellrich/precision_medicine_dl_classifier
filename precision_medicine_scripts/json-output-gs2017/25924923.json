Seventy five percent (n \u003d 24) had loss of hMLH1 and hPMS2 expression, 3% (n \u003d 1) of hPMS2 alone, 18.8% (n \u003d 6) of hMSH6 and hMSH2, 3% (n \u003d 1) of hMSH2 alone. All MMR-deficient tumors showed high MSI. These tumors occurred preferably in the right-sided colon, in women and showed specific histological features. We obtained the family history of 18/32 patients; 2 (11.1%) met Amsterdam Criteria, 5 (27.8%) Bethesda Guidelines and 6 (33.3%) revised Bethesda Guidelines. BRAF V600E mutations were found in 16 (67%) of hMLH1 and none of the hMSH2 deficient tumors.\nWe suggest using immunhistochemical testing of tumor tissues with subsequent MSI analysis, which may be justified as a screening method for MMR deficiency in colorectal cancer, since it identifies patients with possibly hereditary defects and unalike response to chemotherapy.","title":"Tumor and Patient Characteristics of Individuals with Mismatch Repair Deficient Colorectal Cancer.","pubmedId":"25924923"}
