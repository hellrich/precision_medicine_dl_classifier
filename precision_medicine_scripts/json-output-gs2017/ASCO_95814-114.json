Preclinical studies demonstrate that HSP90 inhibitors have anti-tumor activity in EGFR mutant, EGFR TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant lung cancer xenograft models. To prevent disease flare after stopping EGFR TKIs in patients (pts) with EGFR mutated lung cancer, erlotinib (E) is often continued with subsequent lines of treatment for AR.  This phase I study will determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of AUY922 and E for pts with mutated EGFR and RECIST progression on EGFR TKIs. Methods: All pts have EGFR mutant lung cancer, with development of AR (per Jackman, JCO 2010) after treatment with an EGFR TKI.  Pts underwent repeat tumor biopsies after development of AR and prior to study entry.  Pts receive AUY922 IV weekly and E oral daily in 28-day cycles, with dose escalation using standard 3+3 design.  Pharmacokinetics, serial ophthalmology evaluations and weekly assessment for toxicity are required.  Tumor tissue from re-biopsy at study entry is analyzed for EGFR T790M and MET. Results: Since April 2011, 11 pts have been enrolled, in 4 of 5 planned cohorts (AUY922 25 mg/m2 + E 75 mg; AUY922 25 mg/m2+ E 150 mg; AUY922 37.5 mg/m2+ E 150 mg; AUY922 55 mg/m2+E 150 mg).  Prior to developing AR, pts were treated with EGFR TKIs for a median of 9 months (range 8-32).  Of 9 pts with tissue analyzed thus far, 6 had EGFR T790M.  Pts have received a median of two cycles (range 1-7), and 5 remain on study. There have been no dose-limiting toxicities.  Adverse events reported in  20% of pts were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and rash, all graded 1 or 2.  No cardiovascular, renal or hepatic toxicities have been observed.  Three pts have reported flashing lights and 2 pts transient night blindness, all grade 1.  Dose escalation continues.  No partial responses have been seen in 6 evaluable pts, 4 patients have confirmed stable disease at 8 wks. Conclusions: AUY922 and E is a well-tolerated combination at dose levels up to AUY922 55 mg/m2+ E 150 mg.  Further dose-escalation, MTD, and correlation with markers of AR will be reported.
