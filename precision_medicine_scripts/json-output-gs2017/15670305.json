We investigated the expression of Survivin in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) and uterine cervical cancer, to determine whether Survivin expression is related to poor prognosis. Fourteen cases of CIN3, 53 cases of invasive uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 11 cases of normal control group were analyzed retrospectively. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot was performed with antihuman Survivin antibody and analyzed with respect to patient outcome. Survivin was significantly expressed in cervical cancer groups compared to the normal control group (P \u003c 0.05). Significant Survivin expression was also noted in cancer patients with lesion size \u003e or \u003d4 cm, lymphovascular invasion, elevated SCC antigen levels, and no response to initial therapy. In more advanced stages, Survivin expression tended to increase but without statistical significance (P \u003d 0.081). No association was noted between Survivin expression and survival rate (P \u003d 0.1011). We conclude that Survivin expression provides some prognostic information regarding uterine cervical cancer, even though it was not correlated with survival. It could represent a possible new prognostic marker of uterine cervical SCC patients.","title":"Survivin, a novel anti-apoptosis inhibitor, expression in uterine cervical cancer and relationship with prognostic factors.","pubmedId":"15670305"}
