MTAP resides in the same gene cluster of the 9p21 region and is co-deleted in the majority of CDKN2A deleted cases. This study examines the genetic alterations in peritoneal mesotheliomas, which may have a different pathogenesis than their pleural counterparts. Twenty-six cases of peritoneal mesotheliomas in a triplicate tissue microarray were studied. Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed with CDKN2A and MTAP locus-specific probes. Nine of 26 (35%) peritoneal mesotheliomas had homozygous deletion of CDKN2A; MTAP was co-deleted in every case. All cases with CDKN2A deletions had loss of p16 protein expression; five cases had loss of p16 protein without evidence of CDKN2A deletions. All patients with CDKN2A deletions were men (P, NS) and were significantly older (mean, 63 years) than the patients with no deletions (mean, 52 years) (P\u003d0.033, t-test). An association with asbestos exposure could not be proved in this study. Similar to pleural mesotheliomas, patients with CDKN2A deletions and loss of p16 protein expression had worse overall and disease-specific survival (P\u003d0.010 and 0.006, respectively; Kaplan-Meier log rank). Detection of CDKN2A-MTAP co-deletion in peritoneal mesotheliomas, coupled with a p16 immunohistochemical stain as an inexpensive screening tool, can help identify those patients who may have an unfavorable outcome after aggressive cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy and those who may respond to targeted therapy of the MTAP pathway.","title":"CDKN2A and MTAP deletions in peritoneal mesotheliomas are correlated with loss of p16 protein expression and poor survival.","pubmedId":"20081810"}
