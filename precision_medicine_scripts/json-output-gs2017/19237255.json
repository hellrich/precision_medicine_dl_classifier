Between 1988 and 2005, 75 patients underwent surgery for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. There were 53 resections including three additional interventions for recurrence. Twenty-seven exploratory laparotomies showed non resectable tumors and two were followed by a liver transplantation at the beginning of the study. Major hepatectomy was performed in 85% of resections while hepatectic resection was extended to an adjacent organ in 40%. A lymphadenectomy was performed in 32 cases. Mortality was 7.8% (two massive pulmonary embolisms, one mutiple organ failure after transplantation and one post-operative peritonitis). Global morbidity was 47%. Resectability was 66%. In case of surgical resection, the median survival rate was 18 months versus 4 months without resection (p\u003c0.001). Actuarial survival rates at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years were 69, 31 and 27% respectively. Positive nodes decreased the survival rate (13 months versus 20 months, p\u003d0.01). A positive margin (R1 or R2 resection) did not significantly decrease the survival rate (18 months versus 15 months). In conclusion, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is a tumor that often requires a major or an extended hepatectomy. Complete resection is an acceptable and reasonable goal, whatever the patient\u0027s age. This radical surgical approach can prolong survival. Palliative surgery is not an option if incomplete resection is predicted.","title":"[Radical surgery in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"19237255"}
