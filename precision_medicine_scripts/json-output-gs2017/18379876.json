Clinical studies in support of the idea that increased activity of Akt could contribute directly to gastric carcinogenesis are rare, however. In this study we discovered that phospho-Akt1 was overexpressed in human gastric cancers and its levels correlated with tumor differentiation and pTNM. Akt1 activation promoted cell survival, because the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 inhibited Akt1 phosphorylation and inhibited cell growth, especially in cells with active Akt1. Dominant negative Akt inhibited proliferation of gastric cancer cells and induced G1 cell-cycle arrest whereas constitutively active Akt increased cell proliferation. We have therefore identified Akt1 as an active kinase that contributes to gastric cancer progression and promotes proliferation of gastric cancer cells.","title":"Akt1/protein kinase B alpha is involved in gastric cancer progression and cell proliferation.","pubmedId":"18379876"}
