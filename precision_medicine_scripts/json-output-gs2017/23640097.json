However the mutational spectrum of KRAS gene differs by organ site. In this study, we have analysed the mutational spectrum of KRAS exon 1 in bladder tumours, colorectal cancer (CRC) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A total of 366 patients were included in the present study (234 bladder tumours, 48 CRC and 84 CML). The KRAS mutations are absent in BCR/ABL1 positive CML. This result suggests that BCR/ABL1 fusion gene and KRAS mutations were mutually exclusive. The frequency of KRAS mutations in bladder cancer was estimated at 4.27 %. All of mutations were found in codon 12 and 90 % of them were detected in advanced bladder tumours. However the correlation between KRAS mutations and tumour stage and grade does not report a statistical significant association. The KRAS mutations occur in 35.41 % of patients with CRC. The most frequent mutations were G12C, G12D and G13D. These mutations were significantly correlated with histological differentiation of CRC (p \u003d 0.024). Although the high frequency of KRAS in CRC in comparison to bladder cancer, these two cancers appear to have the same mutational spectrum (p \u003e 0.05).","title":"The prevalence and prognostic significance of KRAS mutation in bladder cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"23640097"}
