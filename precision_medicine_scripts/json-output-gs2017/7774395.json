The longer the course of disease, the more significant the changes, with no relation to the etiology of heart disease. The changes were partially improved after treatment of the heart failure. The content of electrolytes is not significantly different in patients in NYHA Class III, compared to those in NYHA Class IV. The metabolic changes of electrolytes occur on the myocardial cells, skeletal muscle cells and peripheral erythrocytes in patients with congestive heart failure. However, serum electrolyte content does not reflect precisely overall electrolyte metabolism in the body. Whether similar changes of electrolyte content occur in the peripheral lymphocytes is rarely reported. We studied the lymphocytic and erythrocytic electrolyte content in patients with congestive heart failure, to provide some reference in the clinical treatment and prognosis of congestive heart failure.","title":"Lymphocytic and erythrocytic k+, Na+, Ca++, Mg++ content in patients with congestive heart failure.","pubmedId":"7774395"}
