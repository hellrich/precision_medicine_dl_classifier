Alectinib is a highly selective, next-generation ALK inhibitor, and both preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that alectinib is also effective in crizotinib-resistant tumors. A recent in vitro study demonstrated significant antitumor activity of alectinib for brain metastases using mouse models of ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. In this paper, we report a first case alectinib was highly effective against brain metastases refractory to crizotinib. Further investigation of alectinib in this setting would be particularly valuable.
