In this study, we analyzed human primary squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) occurring on sun-exposed body sites for mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of Ha-ras, Ki-ras, and N-ras oncogenes by amplification of genomic tumor DNAs by the polymerase chain reaction, followed by dot-blot hybridization to synthetic oligonucleotide probes designed to detect single base-pair mutations. In addition to the primary human skin cancers, we also analyzed Ha-ras-positive NIH 3T3 transformants for mutations in the Ha-ras oncogene. The results indicated that all three NIH 3T3 transformants, 11 of 24 (46%) SCCs, and 5 of 16 (31%) BCCs contained mutations at the second position of Ha-ras codon 12 (GGC----GTC), predicting a glycine-to-valine amino acid substitution, whereas only 1 of 40 skin cancers (an SCC) displayed a mutation in the first position of Ki-ras codon 12 (GGT----AGT), predicting a glycine-to-serine amino acid change. In addition, three of the SCCs contained highly amplified copies of the N-ras oncogene in their genomic DNA. Interestingly, two of the SCCs containing amplified N-ras sequences also had G----T mutations in codon 12 of the Ha-ras oncogene. These studies demonstrate that mutations in codon 12 of the Ha-ras oncogene occurred at a high frequency in human skin cancers originating on sun-exposed body sites, whereas mutation in codon 12 of Ki-ras or amplification of N-ras occurred at a low frequency. Since the mutations in the Ha-ras and Ki-ras oncogenes were located opposite potential pyrimidine dimer sites (C-C), it is likely that these mutations were induced by ultraviolet radiation present in sunlight.","title":"Ras gene mutation and amplification in human nonmelanoma skin cancers.","pubmedId":"2064725"}
