Methods:  Metastatic NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations, who initially responded but subsequently experienced disease progression while on EGFR-TKI treatment, were defined as having acquired resistance. Blood samples were collected after development of such acquired resistance and CTCs were counted using the CellSearch system (Veridex). At the same time, T790M in affected organs or cfDNA was analyzed with cycleave real-time PCR assay and fragment analysis.  Results:  : Six men and 14 women with a mean age of 63.5 yrs (22-84) were enrolled. Histological subtypes were adenocarcinoma in 19 and squamous cell carcinoma in the remaining one. Clinical stages were stage IV in 14 and recurrence with distant metastases after surgical resection in 6. EGFR mutations in tumors at the primary site were G719C in 1, exon 19 deletion in 7, L858R in 10, and G791C + L858R in 2. CTCs were detected in 8 (40%). Numbers of CTCs (per 7.5 ml blood) were 1 in 4 cases, and 3, 4, 8, and 24 in 1 case each. Patients without CTCs survived significantly longer than those with CTCs (1 per 7.5 ml). Mean survival time from first detection of CTCs was 3.0 months in patients with CTCs and not reached in patients without CTCs (p \u003c 0.001). T790M was detected in 6 cases (30%). T790M was found in 75% (n \u003d 6/8) of patients without CTCs but in 0% (n \u003d 0/12) of those with CTCs (p \u003c 0.05).  Conclusions:  The presence of CTCs was correlated with poorly prognosis and lack of T790M in affected organs or cfDNA. The presence of CTCs was informative for distinguishing patients with or without T790M.","title":"Circulating tumor cells and T790M in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations and acquired resistance to TKI.","pubmedId":"ASCO_92867-114"}
