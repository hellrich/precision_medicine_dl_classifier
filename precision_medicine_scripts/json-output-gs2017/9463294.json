The literature is briefly reviewed and the prognostic and therapeutic aspects are discussed.\nThe patient was submitted to surgery. Pathological analysis of the surgical specimen disclosed a myxoid liposarcoma with undifferentiated pleomorphic areas. Patient follow up has shown no recurrence or metastasis.\nThis tumor type develops in scrotal soft tissue, slowly increasing scrotal size, and should be distinguished from inguinoscrotal hernia. Together with physical examination, ultrasonography is generally useful. Treatment is by radical orchiectomy through an inguinal approach; the role of adjuvant therapy remains unclear. It has a good prognosis, with frequent local relapses; metastatic spread is uncommon.","title":"[A paratesticular myxoid liposarcoma as a simulator of a hernial process.
