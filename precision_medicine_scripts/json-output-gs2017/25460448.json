It is characterized by a gastrointestinal polyposis and mucocutaneous melanic spots. It has also been reported as a precondition for malignancies with a life-time-hazard for cancer up to 93%, caused by a germline mutation in the STK11 gene.\nA 21-year-old man presented with nausea and abdominal pain. He had a known history of PJS since the age of 13 when he was treated for intussusception due to a hamartomatous polyp. Preoperative diagnostics revealed a second intussusception and an extensive intestinal polyposis. Intraoperative findings confirmed the suspected diagnoses and desvagination was performed. Nearly 50 polyps were removed from the small intestinum over several longitudinal sections. As the appendix appeared thickened an appendectomy was performed simultaneously. Histology showed hamartomatous polyps and the incidental finding of a pT1 carcinoid of the appendix. The patient recovered well and needed no further treatment for his carcinoid tumor.\nThe mechanism of carcinogenesis in PJS still remains debatable, although the genetic disorder underlying the syndrome is known. A predisposition for carcinoid tumors also stays questionable. To our knowledge there is no description of an association between carcinoid tumors of the appendix and PJS to date.\nLife-expectancy in patients with PJS is reduced. Causes are the development of malignancies and complications from the polyps such as intussusception. Since there is no treatment possible main focus must be aimed at early recognition of malignancies and the prevention of complications.","title":"Appendix carcinoid associated with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","pubmedId":"25460448"}
