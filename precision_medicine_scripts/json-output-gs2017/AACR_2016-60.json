In-vitro studies suggest that loss of PTEN expression and resulting PI3K pathway activation drive cholesterol ester accumulation in aggressive prostate cancers through sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and acyl coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT1) activity. In two prospective cohorts, we studied whether lower PTEN expression is associated with cholesterol metabolism and how this relates to lethal prostate cancer.METHODS: We analyzed men with prostate cancer from the prospective prostatectomy Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians Health Study. 105 men had lethal cancer and 284 men non-lethal disease without metastases at 8 years of follow-up. Whole-transcriptome mRNA expression profiling data was available from diagnostic prostate tumor specimens. Linear regression models were used to assess continuous and categorical associations, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of lethal prostate cancer.RESULTS: Both lower PTEN and higher SQLE expression were associated with higher Gleason grade (p trend \u003c 0.001 each). Correlations of PTEN with SREBF1 (r \u003d -0.08, p \u003d 0.1), SREBF2 (r \u003d -0.09, p \u003d 0.07), and ACAT1 (r \u003d 0.04, p \u003d 0.4) were weak. SREBF2 was correlated with SQLE (r \u003d 0.33, p \u003c 0.001) but not with ACAT1 (r \u003d -0.01, p \u003d 0.8). Low PTEN was associated with lethal cancer (OR, 1.50 per 1 standard deviation [SD] decrease; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.87; p \u003d 0.001). High SQLE was associated with lethal cancer (OR 2.13 per 1 SD increase, 95% CI, 1.63 to 2.79; p \u003c 0.001). SREBF1, SREBF2, and ACAT1 were not associated with lethal cancer (all p \u003e 0.05). Adjusting for PTEN mildly attenuated the association of SQLE with lethal cancer (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.57 to 2.73), as did additional adjustment for age, Gleason grade, and stage (SQLE: OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.40). In the lowest quartile of PTEN expression, SQLE was less strongly associated with lethal cancer (OR 1.74; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.52) compared to the upper three quartiles (OR 2.47; 95% CI, 1.69 to 3.60; p interaction \u003d 0.2).CONCLUSION: Low PTEN mRNA expression and high SQLE are features of aggressive prostate cancers. However, at the time of prostatectomy, SREBF1/2 expression and resulting ACAT1 expression do not appear to be major characteristics of prostate cancers with lethal outcomes.","title":"PTEN expression, cholesterol metabolism, and lethal prostate cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-60"}
