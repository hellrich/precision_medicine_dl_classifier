Despite this activity resistance often develops in patients treated with these agents. This review summarises the biology of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, with particular reference to the effects of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma. The clinical and molecular predictors of response and mechanisms of resistance are discussed in detail along with the biological rationale and evidence for future treatment strategies in both MAPK inhibitor na√Øve and resistant BRAF mutant melanoma.
