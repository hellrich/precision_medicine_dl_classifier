We present a well-differentiated liposarcoma of the tongue, in a 65-year-old man. The tumour presented lipoblasts in various stages of differentiation, lipocytes in different sizes and shapes, mesenchymal and signet-ring cells. Lipoma, spindle-cell lipoma, myxoma, hibernoma, angiolipoma, fibrolipoma, pseudosarcomatous faciitis and malignant hysticytoma were considered in the diagnosis process. The patient was treated surgically and so far is free of disease.","title":"Well-differentiated liposarcoma of the tongue.","pubmedId":"11755832"}
