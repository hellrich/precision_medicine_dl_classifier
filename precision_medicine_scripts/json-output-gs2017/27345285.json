However, imatinib administration can be accompanied by various adverse events. Here we report a case of Lichenoid drug eruption (LDE) that appeared 24 weeks after commencement of imatinib in a 73-year-old man with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The skin lesions were distributed over his face, trunk and limbs, which improved only after discontinuation of imatinib therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of imatinib-induced LDE in the Chinese population.
