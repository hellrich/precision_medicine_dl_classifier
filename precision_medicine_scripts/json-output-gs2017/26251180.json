This includes regulation by Tyr phosphorylation by a mechanism that remains elusive. Here, we show that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylates PTEN in vitro, in cell-free systems and in cells. Furthermore, by mass spectrometry, we identified Tyr336 on PTEN as being phosphorylated by FAK. Tyr336 phosphorylation increased phosphatase activity, protein-lipid interaction, and protein stability of PTEN. In cells, including primary mouse macrophages and human cancer cell lines, FAK was found to be negatively regulated by p110δ phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), whereas the activation of FAK was positively regulated by RhoA-associated kinase (ROCK). Indeed, the phosphorylation of FAK was unexpectedly increased in macrophages derived from mice expressing kinase-dead p110δ. Pharmacologic inactivation of RhoA/ROCK reduced the phosphorylation of FAK to normal levels in cells with genetically inactivated p110δ. Likewise, pharmacologic inactivation of FAK reduced the phosphorylation of PTEN in cells expressing kinase-dead p110δ and restored the functional defects of p110δ inactivation, including Akt phosphorylation and cell proliferation. This work identifies FAK as a target of p110δ PI3K that links RhoA with PTEN and establishes for the first time that PTEN is a substrate of FAK-mediated Tyr phosphorylation.","title":"Focal adhesion kinase phosphorylates the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 under the control of p110δ phosphoinositide-3 kinase.","pubmedId":"26251180"}
