Currently, lapatinib and trastuzumab are in widespread use. Virtually all completed and in progress clinical trials have demonstrated a significant enhancement in the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR), the primary endpoint in these studies, in cases of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer that received trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. Use of lapatinib in the neoadjuvant setting should be considered experimental. When a 12-month course of trastuzumab was added to adjuvant chemotherapy, the disease-free survival (DFS) was greater and the overall survival (OS) was also greater. Although trastuzumab is approved as single-agent therapy, most patients are treated with trastuzumab plus cytotoxic agents. Trastuzumab, administered as single agent, produces durable objective responses and is well tolerated by women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Dual targeting approach with a combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib improved progression-free survival (PFS) as compared with lapatinib alone in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have not had a response to trastuzumab. The combination of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, as compared with placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, when used as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, significantly prolonged PFS. Novel anti-HER2 targeted therapies are needed to utilise novel approaches to combat trastuzumab resistance.","title":"Current and future anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"23613383"}
