Variant profiling is crucial for developing personalized treatment and elucidating the etiology of this disease.\nPatients with PDAC undergoing surgery from 2007 to 2012 (n \u003d 73) were followed from diagnosis until death or the end of the study. We applied an anchored multiplex PCR (AMP)-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) method to a panel of 65 selected genes and assessed analytical performance by sequencing a quantitative multiplex DNA reference standard. In clinical PDAC samples, detection of low-level KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutations was validated by allele-specific PCR and digital PCR. We compared overall survival of patients according to KRAS mutation status by log-rank test and applied logistic regression to evaluate the association between smoking and tumor variant types.\nThe AMP-based NGS method could detect variants with allele frequencies as low as 1% given sufficient sequencing depth (\u003e1500Ã—). Low-frequency KRAS G12 mutations (allele frequency 1%-5%) were all confirmed by allele-specific PCR and digital PCR. The most prevalent genetic alterations were in KRAS (78% of patients), TP53 (tumor protein p53) (25%), and SMAD4 (SMAD family member 4) (8%). Overall survival in T3-stage PDAC patients differed among KRAS mutation subtypes (P \u003d 0.019). Transversion variants were more common in ever-smokers than in never-smokers (odds ratio 5.7; 95% CI 1.2-27.8).\nThe AMP-based NGS method is applicable for profiling tumor variants. Using this approach, we demonstrated that in PDAC patients, KRAS mutant subtype G12V is associated with poorer survival, and that transversion variants are more common among smokers.","title":"Variant Profiling of Candidate Genes in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26378065"}
