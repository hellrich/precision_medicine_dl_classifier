Overexpression of ERBB2 (c-erb-b2; formerly HER2/neu), which is a member of the epidermal growth receptor family, is associated with involvement of lymph nodes, large tumor size, high grade, steroid receptor negativity, aneuploidy, high proliferation rate, and low overall survival in breast cancer. The aim of the study was to examine whether ERBB2 amplification has any effect on circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in breast cancer patients.\nFifty patients with primary breast carcinoma, classified as either ERBB2 (+) or (-) by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, were included in the study. Cytokines were studied by ELISA according to the procedure described in the commercial kit.\nIL-2 levels were found significantly higher in ERBB2+ patients than in controls (p\u003c0.05). A significant negative correlation existed between ERBB2 positivity and estrogen receptor status (p\u003d0.004). Plasma TNF-alpha and IL-2 levels were positively correlated in ERBB2+ breast cancer patients (p\u003c0.01).\nThe increase in IL-2 concentrations observed in our study suggests an activation of T cells by ERBB2 peptides.","title":"Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-2 concentrations in newly diagnosed ERBB2 (HER2/neu) positive breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"19787624"}
