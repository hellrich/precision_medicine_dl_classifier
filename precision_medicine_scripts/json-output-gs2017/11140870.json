With the combination of blue dye and radioisotope mapping, the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) can be harvested with pinpoint accuracy. This article compares blue dye and radioisotope mapping techniques. Based on the clinical outcome data of selective sentinel lymph node dissection, micrometastasis to the SLNs carries a poor prognosis for patients with primary invasive melanoma.","title":"The role of sentinel lymph nodes in malignant melanoma.","pubmedId":"11140870"}
