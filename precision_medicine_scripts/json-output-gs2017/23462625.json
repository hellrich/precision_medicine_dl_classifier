Preclinical data show inhibitory activity of angiogenic, stromal and oncogenic tyrosine kinases through the targeting of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3, tyrosine-protein kinase receptor TIE-2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret, mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit, RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase and wild-type and V600E mutant serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf. Phase I trials have shown that the drug is relatively well tolerated at doses of 160 mg daily on a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule, or 100 mg daily on a continuous schedule, with adverse effects typical of other multikinase inhibitors. Phase II studies demonstrated clinical benefit in a variety of tumor types, mostly associated with prolonged stable disease. Phase III studies include the CORRECT trial, which ultimately led to FDA approval of the drug in the setting of metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with standard therapies. There is still much work to be done to determine the role of regorafenib in the future of cancer therapy. This review will focus on the development of regorafenib, from early preclinical work through phase I, II and III trials, as well as highlighting the current role and potential future directions of this novel agent.","title":"The development of regorafenib and its current and potential future role in cancer therapy.","pubmedId":"23462625"}
