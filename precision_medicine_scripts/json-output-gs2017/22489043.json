We searched for mutations in ASXL1, CBL, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, MPL, NF1, SF3B1, SUZ12, and TET2 genes in 149 non-CML MPNs, including 127 \"classic\" MPNs cases. JAK2 was mutated in 100% PV, 66% ET and 68% MF. We found a high incidence of ASXL1 mutation in MF patients (20%) and a low incidence in PV (7%) and ET (4%) patients. Mutations in the other genes were rare (CBL, DNMT3A, IDH2, MPL, SF3B1, SUZ12, NF1) or absent (IDH1).","title":"Mutation analysis of ASXL1, CBL, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, MPL, NF1, SF3B1, SUZ12, and TET2 in myeloproliferative neoplasms.","pubmedId":"22489043"}
