K-ras mutations are observed in \u003e90% of pancreatic cancer, suggesting its role in the initiation and early developmental stages of PDAC. In order to gain mechanistic insight as to the role of mutated K-ras, several mouse models have been developed by targeting a conditionally mutated K-ras(G12D) for recapitulating PDAC. A significant co-operativity has been shown in tumor development and metastasis in a compound mouse model with activated K-ras and Ink4a/Arf deficiency. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which K-ras and Ink4a/Arf deficiency contribute to PDAC has not been fully elucidated.\nTo assess the molecular mechanism(s) that are involved in the development of PDAC in the compound transgenic mice with activated K-ras and Ink4a/Arf deficiency, we used multiple methods, such as Real-time RT-PCR, western blotting assay, immunohistochemistry, MTT assay, invasion, EMSA and ELISA. We found that the deletion of Ink4a/Arf in K-ras(G12D) expressing mice leads to PDAC, which is in part mediated through the activation of Notch and NF-κB signaling pathways. Moreover, we found down-regulation of miR-200 family, which could also play important roles in tumor development and progression of PDAC in the compound transgenic mice.\nOur results suggest that the activation of Notch and NF-κB together with the loss of miR-200 family is mechanistically linked with the development and progression of PDAC in the compound K-ras(G12D) and Ink4a/Arf deficient transgenic mice.","title":"Activated K-ras and INK4a/Arf deficiency cooperate during the development of pancreatic cancer by activation of Notch and NF-κB signaling pathways.","pubmedId":"21673986"}
