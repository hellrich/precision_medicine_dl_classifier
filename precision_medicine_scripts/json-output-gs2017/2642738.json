The polymerase chain reaction technique was used to amplify DNA fragments containing Kirsten-(Ki-), Harvey-(Ha-), and N-ras codons 12, 13, and 61 which were then probed on slot-blots with labeled synthetic oligomers to detect nonconservative single base mutations. Activating mutations were found in one of 40 primary tumors (Ki-ras codon 13), zero of seven lymph node and skin metastases, one of nine metastatic effusions (Ki-ras codon 12), and two of five cell lines (Ki-ras codons 12 and 13). These results indicate that activating ras mutations are rarely involved in either the initiation or metastatic progression of human breast cancer.","title":"Incidence of activating ras oncogene mutations associated with primary and metastatic human breast cancer.","pubmedId":"2642738"}
