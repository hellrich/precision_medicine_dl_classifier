Because of the high frequency of BRCA2 mutations in breast cancer families with at least one case of male breast cancer, we selected a cohort of 39 such families, tested negative for mutations in the coding regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2, and developed an assay for BRCA2 rearrangements, based on quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF). We found three rearrangements: (1) a deletion of exons 12 and 13; (2) a duplication of exons 1 and 2; and (3) a complete deletion of BRCA2. We determined the boundaries of the deletion of exons 12 and 13, showing that it resulted from an unequal recombination between Alu sequences. We mapped the complete BRCA2 deletion, which extends over at least 298 kb and showed that it does not affect APRIN/AS3, previously characterized as a tumor suppressor gene, but it comprises several loci corresponding to proven or putative transcripts of unknown functional significance. These data suggest that screening for BRCA2 rearrangements should be done, especially in male breast cancer families tested negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.","title":"Significant contribution of germline BRCA2 rearrangements in male breast cancer families.","pubmedId":"15548676"}
