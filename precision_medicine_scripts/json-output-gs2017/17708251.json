A 75-year-old female was referred to our hospital with a large hepatic mass. Computerized tomography examination showed a huge mass in the right liver extended partially to the left liver. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was strongly suspected, but surgical resection was abandoned due to the local spread in the liver. Three courses of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with degradable starch microspheres were performed. The anticancer agents, mitomycin C and epirubicin, combined with degradable starch microspheres were injected from the catheter for chemoembolization. After three courses of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, the tumor size decreased from 10cm to 5.5cm in diameter. Then right trisegmentectomy together with extra-hepatic bile duct excision was performed. At 25 months after the first therapy and 21 months after operation, the patient remains healthy without recurrence. Transcatheter arterial chemotherapy with degradable starch microspheres may be a treatment of choice with locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma successfully resected after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with degradable starch microspheres: report of a case.","pubmedId":"17708251"}
