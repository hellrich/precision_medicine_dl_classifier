CDKN1A and RUNX2 (both 6p21.2) were amplified in 11 and 16 of 21 primary CoMs, respectively. In metastatic CoMs, MLH1 (3p22.1) and TIMP2 (17q25.3) were frequently amplified, and MGMT (20q26.3) and ECHS1 (10q26.3) were frequently deleted. The BDH (3q), FLJ20265 (4p), OPRL1 (20q), and PAO (10q) genes, representing the telomeres of their respective chromosome arms in the P036 assay, were frequently amplified in metastatic CoMs. No statistically significant associations were identified between BRAF mutation or CDKN1A or RUNX2 amplification and sex, age, histologic cell type, or patient survival.\nNo copy number changes were associated exclusively with metastatic CoMs. However, further investigation of the role of CDKN1A and RUNX2 in CoMs development and that of MLH1, TIMP2, MGMT, and ECHS1 in metastatic CoMs is warranted. Validation of the observed gene and chromosome arm copy number changes in a larger cohort of primary and metastatic CoMs is necessary to identify the patients at highest risk for CoMs metastasis.","title":"Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of conjunctival melanoma reveals common BRAF V600E gene mutation and gene copy number changes.","pubmedId":"21693616"}
