We report a case of a primary lung adenocarcinoma in an 18-year-old man who presented for examination of a solitary nodule located in the right lower lobe of the lung. A right lower lobectomy was performed with an incomplete resection because of pleural dissemination (pT4N2M0 stage IIIB adenocarcinoma). Intrathoracic chemotherapy (cisplatin, 50 mg/body) was administered initially, followed by systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel). A bronchopleural fistula occurred 2 months postoperatively and was successfully treated with conservative therapy, including thoracic drainage, intrathoracic fibrin glue administration, and transbronchial superglue administration. Thereafter, a total of five courses of systemic chemotherapy with minor changes in the administration regimen were performed. The patient was alive and with no evidence of recurrence at his 5-year follow-up.","title":"Successful treatment of lung adenocarcinoma in an 18-year-old man.","pubmedId":"22231790"}
