The tumor was resected and right inguinal orchidectomy was performed. The tumor had not recurred after 6 months follow-up.\nSpermatic cord liposarcoma (SCL) is a rare medical condition and it is therefore difficult to establish guidelines for treatment, diagnosis and prognosis. Radical orchidectomy with wide local excision of the mass is the recommended therapy, while adjuvant radiotherapy may be considered in intermediate or high-grade tumors and recurrent liposarcomas. The role of chemotherapy is not well-defined.","title":"[Liposarcoma of the spermatic cord: a case report].","pubmedId":"21465089"}
