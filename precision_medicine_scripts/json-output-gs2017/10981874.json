Strong immunoreactivity with smooth muscle and desmin antibodies and ultrastructural features consistent with leiomyosarcoma were observed in the spindle-cell and/or myxoid-like components in all four recurrences in case 1, and in the spindle-cell component of the primary tumor and the first recurrence in case 2. In case 1, the correct diagnosis was suggested by the cytogenetic evidence of ring markers, a hallmark of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. In case 2, tumor type was yielded mainly by the morphology of the second recurrence, which consisted entirely of a well-differentiated liposarcoma, a sclerosing inflammatory variant, as confirmed by the karyotype. Reevaluation of the first two surgical specimens of each case revealed small areas consistent with well-differentiated liposarcoma that had been previously overlooked. Despite the smooth-muscle antigen profile, both cases retained an mdm2+/p53+/cdk4+ immunophenotype consistent with the genotype.","title":"Morphologic-cytogenetic analysis of dedifferentiated liposarcomas with an extensive misleading leiomyosarcomatous component.","pubmedId":"10981874"}
