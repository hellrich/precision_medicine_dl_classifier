The three tunics of the heart can be affected. However, valvular disease is rare and, when present, is usually regurgitant. Stenosis is very rare. The authors report the case of a 31 year old man who developed double mitro-aortic valvular stenosis 20 years after mediastinal radiotherapy associated with aortic regurgitation, right coronary stenosis and inflammatory epicardo-pericarditis with effusion. Surgery was undertaken and associated double aortic and mitral valve replacement and right coronary by pass grafting.","title":"[Double stenosing valve disease after mediastinal radiotherapy: a case report of a 31 year-old man].","pubmedId":"9749241"}
