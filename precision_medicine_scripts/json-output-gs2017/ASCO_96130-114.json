Furthermore, clinical experience revealed that cancers with acquired resistance can respond again to  TKIs, after a drug-free interval. To aid in identification and treatment  of these patients we examined a cohort of patients whose cancers were assessed with tumor biopsies at multiple times  before and after their treatment with TKIs. Methods: 21 lung adenocarcinomas pts. (10 male, 11 female, median age 53 years) with EGFR mutations at 19 or 21 exons received TKIs, as first line of treatment. All showed a clinical response and all relapsed ( mTTP 10 months). At the time of relapse a new biopsy was performed, histologic samples were reviewed to re-confirm the diagnosis, EGFR and MET amplification were identified by FISH, while EGFR mutations have been tested by DNA sequencing.   Results: At the time that drug resistence was acquired all pts. retained their original activating EGFR mutations, 9 pts. developed EGFR T790M resistance mutation with pronunced EGFR amplification in 3, 2 pts. developed MET amplification,  8  biopsies did not reveal any new mutations, two pts. were found to have a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer in their drug resistant tumor biopsies and responded well to conventional chemotherapy regimen.15 of 19 confirmed lung adenocarcinoma patient underwent to a cisplatin - pemetrexed  chemotherapy regimen and at the time of progression 10 of them accepted to undergo a new biopsy.  Three pts. ( after 4,  5 and 6 months break from treatment with TKIs ) lost T790M mutation and their disease responded to a second-line course of erlotinib.  Conclusions: In our cohort of pts. with acquired EGFR resistence some patients lost acquired T790M mutation and become sensitive to EGFR inhibitor, in addition, two pts. underwent the histologic transformation from NSCLC to SCLC at the time of TKI resistence.","title":"A static diagnostic biopsy in patients with mutated EGFR lung adenocarcinom to guide therapeutic decisions.","pubmedId":"ASCO_96130-114"}
