{"genes":["Prostate cancer gene"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"With recent advances in genetic engineering, tumor biology, and immunology, gene therapy has been recognized as a promising new treatment option for various cancers, including prostate cancer. Several clinical trials of prostate cancer gene therapy, using therapeutic genes which include suicide genes, immunomodulatory genes, tumor suppressor genes, and anti-oncogenes, are under way and preliminary reports have emerged. Although gene therapy for prostate cancer is still at an early stage and requires additional technological breakthroughs, new insights obtained from recent clinical trials indicate a promising potential for prostate cancer gene therapy. In this report, general concepts, current progress, and future prospects in prostate cancer gene therapy are summarized.","title":"Prostate cancer gene therapy-what have we learned and where are we going?","pubmedId":"16985716"}
