While tumors outside of the gastrointestinal tract have been described, to our knowledge the case we present is the first such case in the vagina. We describe a 75-year-old woman with a recurrent vaginal gastrointestinal stromal tumor without apparent rectal involvement. This tumor was characterized by short intersecting fascicles of spindled cells, focal necrosis, and 12 to 15 mitoses per 50 high-power fields. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for CD117 (c-Kit), CD34, vimentin, and h-caldesmon. Tumor cells were negative for S100, desmin, actin, and CAM 5.2. The differential diagnosis in this case included a vaginal smooth muscle tumor. While histologically similar to a smooth muscle neoplasm, the immunohistochemical profile ruled out smooth muscle differentiation. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vaginal mesenchymal neoplasms.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor presenting as a recurrent vaginal mass.","pubmedId":"15578893"}
