Occurrence of PDA is linked to activating Kras mutations and aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, leading to additional activation of wild-type Kras. As Kras is difficult to target, there is a constant need to identify novel targets acting downstream of this molecule in driving the formation or progression of PDA. Recently, it was shown that protein kinase D enzymes not only are increasingly expressed in PDA but also causatively linked to the development and progression of this cancer. They act downstream of both mutant Kras and growth factors and therefore may represent ideal novel targets.","title":"Protein kinase D enzymes: novel kinase targets in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"26174103"}
