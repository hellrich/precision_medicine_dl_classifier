Extubation was done rapidly. Two months before, the patient suffering from breast cancer without metastases underwent a radical mastectomy. Thoracic x-ray presented a progressive shadow. Differential diagnoses took into consideration neoplastic, infectious or immunologic causes. The following day the patient suffered from dyspnea. A cardiopulmonary resuscitation was without success. Obduction revealed a honeycomb lung. Histology presented an idiopathic lung fibrosis.","title":"[75-year old female with progressive idiopathic lung fibrosis].","pubmedId":"21240597"}
