Initially, dysregulated genes in pancreatic cancer were identified using paired t-test. Subsequently, dysregulated biological pathways involved in the development of pancreatic cancer were identified by enrichment analysis. Finally, individual survival analysis of the significantly dysregulated functions was conducted at the pathway level. Our results indicated that the pathway named ̔Pathways in cancer was significantly correlated with survival time. In addition, the mean survival time of individual and genetic variation demonstrated a significantly negative correlation, that is, the lower the genetic variation, the longer the survival time. Furthermore, detailed analysis of genes on the pathway named ̔Pathways in cancer denoted that this pathway involved multiple cancer hallmark signals and several dysregulated cancer genes, including tumor protein p53, myelocytomatosis, Kirsten rat sarcoma, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A. According to the DrugBank database, certain oncogenes have been validated to be the targets of drugs, including Sorafenib, Trastuzumab, Imatinib and Paclitaxel or were under investigation. An improved understanding of the pathophysiology of pancreatic cancer has been achieved based on our results and the present study aimed to provide guidance for the development of drugs to treat pancreatic cancer.","title":"Identification of dysregulated pathways associated with pancreatic cancer by survival analysis.","pubmedId":"25333741"}
