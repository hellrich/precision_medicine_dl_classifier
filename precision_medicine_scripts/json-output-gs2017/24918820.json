Hazard ratios for contralateral breast cancer, distant disease-free and breast cancer-specific death for mutation carriers vs noncarriers were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard method, stratified for adjuvant chemotherapy.\nThe CHEK2 mutation carriers (n\u003d193) had an increased incidence of contralateral breast cancer (multivariate hazard ratio 3.97, 95% confidence interval 2.59-6.07). Distant disease-free and breast cancer-specific survival were similar in the first 6 years in mutation carriers compared with noncarriers, but diverted as of 6 years after breast cancer diagnosis (multivariate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals 2.65 (1.79-3.93) and 2.05 (1.41-2.99), respectively). No significant interaction between CHEK2 and adjuvant chemotherapy was observed.\nThe CHEK2 1100delC-associated breast cancer is associated with a higher contralateral breast cancer rate as well as worse survival measures beyond 6 years after diagnosis. No differential sensitivity to adjuvant chemotherapy was observed in CHEK2 patients.","title":"Survival and contralateral breast cancer in CHEK2 1100delC breast cancer patients: impact of adjuvant chemotherapy.","pubmedId":"24918820"}
