This is an extremely rare presentation. The histological feature of interest was the spindle cell lipoma-like appearance of the well-differentiated component. The use of MDM2 immunostaining in differentiating benign lipomatous tumours from well-differentiated liposarcomas is mentioned, which is of value especially in lipomatous tumours of the gut where ulcerated benign tumours can show varying degrees of atypia.","title":"Dedifferentiated liposarcoma presenting as jejunal polyp.
