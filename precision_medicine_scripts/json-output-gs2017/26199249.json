We present the first case of S-1, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab therapy in our hospital. The patient was a 69-year-old woman with ascending colon cancer and multiple lung and liver metastases. She tended to suffer from constipation; stenoses at the cecum and colon cancer were detected by colon fiberscopy. Following surgical resection of the primary tumor, the patient received systemic chemotherapy with S-1, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab. Following chemotherapy, CT showed no cancer in the lung and cancer reduction in the liver or dissemination. The patient had diarrhea and no appetite at first, so we reduced the oxaliplatin dose by 80%. After reduction of the oxaliplatin dose, we could treat the patient with S-1 and oxaliplatin continuously with no toxicity. S-1 and oxaliplatin chemotherapy is cost-effective, and has less toxicity than other chemotherapies, if proper measures are taken. It seemed to have a non-inferior response rate and disease control compared to other chemotherapies, such as FOLFOX. Thus, this chemotherapy is a valid choice for metastatic colorectal cancer.","title":"[Clinical Response of Metastatic Colon Cancer to Chemotherapy with S-1 and Oxaliplatin - A Case Report].","pubmedId":"26199249"}
