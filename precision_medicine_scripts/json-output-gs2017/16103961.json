The aim of the study was i) to analyze value and results of surgical therapy and ii) to detect the prognostic parameters, which determine significantly higher survival rates.\nTwo-hundred-twenty patients with pancreatic and ampullary carcinoma (mean age, 61.4 years; 104 females/116 males) underwent surgery. Histologic investigation revealed 19 carcinomas of the papilla of Vater and 201 ductal pancreatic carcinomas. In 126 patients, stage IV a or b tumors were found, in addition, stage I (n \u003d26), II (n \u003d 17) and III (n \u003d 51). Survival-rate was determined according to the method by Kaplan/Meier. Survival was compared using log-rank test. Association of several or multiple parameters with survival was tested using Cox model.\nHundred-ten patients underwent tumor resection with primary curative intention (50 %): 96 resections of the pancreatic head, 2 total pancreatectomies and 12 left resections of the pancreas. R0-resection was achieved in 94 patients (42.7 %), whereas intervention was classified R1 in 10 and R2 in 6 cases. In addition, 60 palliative interventions (28 gastroenterostomies, 17 biliodigestive anastomoses, 15 anastomoses at both sites) and 50 explorative laparotomies were performed. In 42.3 % of patients, postoperative complications were found, but only 12/220 individuals died (overall letality, 5.4 %). Postoperative letality of curative pancreatic resections was 3.6 % (palliative intervention, 6.7 %; explorative laparotomy, 8.8 %). Five-year survival-rate of carcinoma of the papilla of Vater and pancreatic carcinoma was 73.3 % and 16.2 %, respectively (median survival time was 66.0 and 14.0 months, respectively). Taken together all other interventions, median survival time ranged between 4.0 (palliative intervention) to 10.0 months (R1-resection). No patient survived 5 years. Therefore, the most relevant prognostic factor was R0-resection. In addition, prognosis after successful R0-resection is determined significantly by tumor site, stage of the tumor (according to UICC), T- and N-category.\nResection of pancreatic and ampullary carcinoma according to oncological criteria with tumor-free margins can be considered a treatment option with curative intention and potential. Despite relative high postoperative morbidity, only a low mortality rate was observed. The 5-year survival-rate of 16.2 % in ductal pancreatic carcinoma underlines the demand for the development of effective multimodal therapeutic concepts. Interventions with primary palliative intention or resections with microscopically or macroscopically detectable tumor residual in situ lead to no significant or only marginal prolongation of survival time. Such interventions in patients with pancreatic carcinoma are no reasonable treatment alternative. They are of value only for treatment of tumor-associated complications and problems.","title":"[Results of surgical treatment in ampullary and pancreatic carcinoma and its prognostic parameters after R0-resection].","pubmedId":"16103961"}
