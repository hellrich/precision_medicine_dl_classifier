Merlin is considered a member of the band 4.1 families of cytoskeleton-associated proteins also called ERM family and acts as tumor suppressor. The main cause for transformation of Schwann cells into schwannomas is credited to the inactivation of the neurofibromin 2 (NF2) gene and the consecutive loss of its protein merlin. Recent scientific advances improved our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms involving NF2 gene. The present review brings genetic properties of NF2 gene, molecular characteristics of merlin, summarizes mutational spectra and explains merlin\u0027s multifunctional roles regarding its involvement in neurofibromatosis associated tumorigenesis.
