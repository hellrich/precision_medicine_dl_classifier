However, the responses to EGFR-TKIs vary even among patients with EGFR mutations. We studied several other independently active biomarkers for EGFR-TKI treatment.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the serum concentrations of 13 molecules in a cohort of 95 patients with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma who received EGFR-TKI treatment at three centers. The pretreatment serum concentrations of amphiregulin, β-cellulin, EGF, EGFR, epiregulin, fibroblast growth factor-basic, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), platelet-derived growth factor β polypeptide, placental growth factor, tenascin C, transforming growth factor-α, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a multiplex immunoassay system. The associations between clinical outcomes and these molecules were evaluated.\nThe concentrations of HGF and VEGF were significantly higher among patients with progressive disease than among those without progressive disease (P \u003c 0.0001). HGF and VEGF were strongly associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in a univariate Cox analysis (all tests for hazard ratio showed P \u003c 0.0001). A stratified multivariate Cox model according to EGFR mutation status (mutant, n \u003d 20; wild-type, n \u003d 23; unknown, n \u003d 52) showed that higher HGF levels were significantly associated with a shorter PFS and OS (P \u003c 0.0001 for both PFS and OS). These observations were also consistent in the subset analyses.\nSerum HGF was strongly related to the outcome of EGFR-TKI treatment. Our results suggest that the serum HGF level could be used to refine the selection of patients expected to respond to EGFR-TKI treatment, warranting further prospective study.","title":"Impact of serum hepatocyte growth factor on treatment response to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20679350"}
