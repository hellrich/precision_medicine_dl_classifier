The aim of this study was to clarify whether PPARgamma ligands could inhibit the growth of human cholangiocarcinoma cells. PPAR( expression in HuH-28 and HuCCT1 cells (intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma) was determined using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of PPARgamma mRNA was detected in both cell lines. Activation of PPARgamma by troglitazone caused marked growth inhibition in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Troglitazone inhibited the growth of human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines by inducing apoptosis and by cell cycle regulation (G1 arrest), and this was associated with caspase 3 and caspase 9 activation. Thus, molecular targeting with troglitazone, a nuclear receptor ligand, may be a promising strategy for treating cholangiocarcinoma, although a delivery system needs to be established.","title":"A Ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma inhibits human cholangiocarcinoma cell growth: potential molecular targeting strategy for cholangioma.","pubmedId":"16927143"}
