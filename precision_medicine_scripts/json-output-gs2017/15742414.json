Tumor recurrence and distant metastasis were used as the criteria of malignancy.\nThe result showed that approximately 25% (29/108) of the gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors were negative for CD117 and approximately 6% (7/108) of the tumors were CD117-negative GISTs. All these CD117-negative tumors had a mutated KIT and a wild-type PDGFRA. All CD117-negative GISTs with mutations at codons 557/558 of KIT had mitotic counts \u003e10/50 high power field, and 75% (3/4) of them showed multiple recurrence or distant metastasis.\nCD117-negative KIT mutated GISTs account for approximately 6% of the gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors. Tumor recurrence or distant metastasis correlates to both the KIT mutations at codons 557/558 and the mitotic counts, but not to the tumor size.","title":"Analysis of CD117-negative gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"15742414"}
