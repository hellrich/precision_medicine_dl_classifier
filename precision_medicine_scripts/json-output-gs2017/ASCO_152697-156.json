KRAS status has been used as a negative predictive marker. Its effect on the natural history of advanced disease remains to be clarified. The aim of this study is to examine patterns of metastatic disease at presentation and progression, as well as the interaction with age, resectability and overall survival.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective review of patients treated with 5FU based doublet chemotherapy at our institution between 2011-2014. Data gathered included age at diagnosis, sites of metastatic disease at presentation, histology, chemotherapy regimens, duration of response, and patterns of progression. Data was analysed using standard statistical methods  Results:   59 patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 60. The most frequently used chemotherapy regimen was FOLFOX, and all eligible patients ultimately received targeted agents. 58% of patients were KRAS-wild type(WT), 32% KRAS-mutated(mt), and in 8% it was not tested. 75% of patients had 2 or more sites of metastatic disease at presentation, which was not significantly different between KRAS-WT and KRAS-mt groups, or age (p \u003d 0.492 and p \u003d 0.729 respectively). Looking at sites of metastatic disease, 40% of KRAS-mt patients had 1 site of non-regional lymph node metastasis compared to \u003c 10% in KRAS-WT(p \u003d 0.041), although there was no statistical difference when age was analysed(p \u003d 0.472). At the time of disease progression 90% of KRAS-mt patients progressed within an existing site of disease, compared to 70% in the KRAS-WT group (p \u003d 0.393). 30% of the KRAS-WT group and 37% of the KRAS-mt group had surgical resection of sites of disease. Overall survival for the KRAS-WT group was 38 months, versus 32.7 months for the KRAS-mt group, p \u003d 0.554.  Conclusions:   This study shows that age or KRAS status do not influence survival in our patient population. Site and distribution of metastatic disease was equal between the two groups. Our excellent survival is contributed to by the proactive approach taken by our surgical colleagues in resecting sites of metastatic disease, combined with the increasing range of systemic therapies available to us.","title":"Influence of KRAS status, pattern of metastatic disease and age on survival in stage IV colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_152697-156"}
