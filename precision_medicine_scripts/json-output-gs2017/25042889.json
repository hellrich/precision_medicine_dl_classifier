The viral oncoprotein SV40 large T antigen (TAg) can inhibit the effects of the Rb family of molecules and of p53 on these pathways, and targeted expression of TAg in mouse pancreas is associated with the development of endocrine or acinar cell tumours. In this study, to determine whether the viral oncoprotein promotes pancreatic duct carcinogenesis initiated by oncogenic KRAS, we generated mice expressing temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen (tsTAg) on pancreatic epithelial cells in the presence or absence of Kras(G12D) . Mice with pancreas-specific tsTAg expression developed acinar cell dysplasia by 22 weeks without PanIN formation, while mice expressing both tsTAg and Kras(G12D) developed highly aggressive adenocarcinoma with a ductal cell phenotype within a short period, and died within 3 weeks. The tumours resembled human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) at the histological level, and oncogenic Kras and tsTAg synergistically activated E2f and Sre transcription in established PDAC cell lines. These results suggest that tsTAg synergistically promotes Kras(G12D) -associated PDAC formation, and our study identifies a new mouse model of PDAC that may allow a better understanding of the mechanism of carcinogenesis in pancreatic carcinoma, which shows a catastrophic clinical course.","title":"A genetically engineered mouse model developing rapid progressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25042889"}
