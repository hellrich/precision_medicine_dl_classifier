The expression level of FHIT gene was closely related to histological classification, cancer cell differentiation, P TNM stages and lymph node involvement in lung cancer patients (P \u003c 0.05). The positive rate of FHIT expression in smoking lung cancer patients was remarkably lower than that in non smoking ones ( 55.14% ±27.55% vs 71.93%±22.05%, P \u003c 0.01). The postoperative survival time in patients with high FHIT expression was significantly longer than those with low expression (P \u003c 0.05).\nReduction of FHIT gene expression might be associated with the oncogenesis and progression of human lung cancer; Smoking may be one of the important reasons of reduction of FHIT gene expression in lung cancer patients.","title":"[Reduction of FHIT gene expression in primary lung cancer].","pubmedId":"21315018"}
