In the present study, an attempt was made to identify the factors that might predict the postoperative prognosis of patients with metastatic liver GIST. The clinicopathologic or genetic features of resected liver GIST in 14 patients who had undergone a hepatectomy for metachronous liver metastases and who had not received adjuvant imatinib treatment were examined. LOH of the c-kit gene was observed in seven of 12 metastatic liver GIST (58.3%), of which DNA suitable for testing could be extracted. Ten patients had recurrence after hepatectomy and four had none. The median post-recurrent disease-free survival (PRDFS) after hepatectomy was 27.5 months (range 8-104). The tumor-specific PRDFS was examined using clinicopathologic features, c-kit mutation and LOH of the c-kit gene. No single clinicopathologic or genetic finding was significantly associated with PRDFS. However, patients with \u0027Ki67 labeling index \u003c5% and LOH(-)\u0027 had a significantly longer PRDFS than those with \u0027Ki67 \u003e/\u003d5% or LOH(+)\u0027 (P \u003d 0.032), and there was no correlation between the presence of LOH of the c-kit gene and the Ki67 labeling index. LOH of the c-kit gene in metastatic liver seems to be a common event, and LOH of the c-kit gene in resected liver GIST may be a helpful factor in the prediction of the post-recurrent prognosis of patients with liver metastasis.","title":"Effect of loss of heterozygosity of the c-kit gene on prognosis after hepatectomy for metastatic liver gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"17894554"}
