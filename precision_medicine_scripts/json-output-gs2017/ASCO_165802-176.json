Despite their accepted role as oncogenic drivers, effective targeted intervention remains elusive. KRAS mts are heterogeneous, with multiple amino acid substitutions differentially associated with patient smoking status and tumor biology, modified further by variable gene amplification levels and co-mt patterns. To identify characteristics of KRAS-mt lung cancers that benefit from MEK inhibition, we investigated the activity of trametinib in a heterogeneous series of KRAS-mt PDX models selected for differences in genomic makeup. Methods: Clinically annotated patient tumor (biopsy, resection or pleural effusion) was implanted subcutaneously into the flank of NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. The resultant PDXs were analyzed for driver mts (JAX 358 CTP panel); copy number variants and global RNA expression (Affymetrix arrays; RNA sequencing). PDX cohorts (n \u003d 6-10) were treated with trametinib at 2-3mg/kg p.o. QDx5/week for 4 weeks, with follow-up until tumors reached pre-determined size. Parallel pharmacodynamic (PD) studies were conducted at 4 \u0026 24h in select models by immunoblotting. Results: To date, 18 KRAS-mt PDX lung cancer models have been established, harboring KRAS G12C, G12D, G12A, G12S or G13R substitutions. 16 models co-harbored TP53mts. Other co-mts of interest included STK11, ATM, Keap1 \u0026 BRCA1/2 disrupting mutations, and one model with PI3K E542K. 37% exhibited KRAS gene amplification. Trametinib induced statistically significant tumor growth inhibition in 5 of 9 models tested to date. Characteristics of responsive models included non-G12C KRAS mt with concurrent gene amplification. PD analysis revealed reduction in both MEK and ERK phosphorylation in responsive models. Non-responders showed negligible effect on pERK. Conclusions: In KRAS-mt lung cancer PDX models, single-agent trametinib resulted in partial growth inhibition in 5 of 9 models, concomitant with downregulation of pERK. The preserved tumor heterogeneity and genomic complexity of PDXs provides an ideal preclinical platform to model strategic combinations of targeted regimens for KRAS-mt lung cancer.","title":"Interrogating MEK inhibition in a KRAS-mutant lung cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) resource.","pubmedId":"ASCO_165802-176"}
