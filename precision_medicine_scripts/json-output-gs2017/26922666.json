Most patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease and are then ineligible for surgical resection, which is the only potentially curative therapeutic modality. The aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date review of medical management of patients with cholangiocarcinoma. The benefit of adjuvant therapy in patients undergoing curative-intent surgery is under evaluation. Combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and platinum is the standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Targeted agents are not currently recommended due to limited data on use in this setting. The role of second-line chemotherapy is not established in advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Identification of predictive and prognostic markers to select patients who could benefit from second-line therapy is a major issue. A better understanding of the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the carcinogenesis and the phenotypic heterogeneity of cholangiocarcinoma may path the way of new therapeutic strategies.
