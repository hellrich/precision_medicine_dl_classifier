Immunohistochemical analyses proved the tumor cells to express the melanocytic markers S100 protein, NK1/C3 and HMB 45 antigens in an intense and distinct pattern. The controversial theories of the pathogenesis of balloon cell changes in melanocytic neoplasms are discussed.","title":"Nodular balloon cell component in a cutaneous melanoma of the superficial spreading type.","pubmedId":"8726648"}
