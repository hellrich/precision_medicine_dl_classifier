The major side effects are bone marrow suppression, alopecia, polyneuropathy and cardiac toxicity like bradycardia, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and cardiac death.\nIntensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital.\nWe report on a 58-years-old woman with a metastatic ovarian carcinoma who had chest pain, nausea and collapse during their first Taxol infusion. The infusion was stopped and the patient was submitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) to exclude an acute coronary syndrome.\nThe electrocardiography (ECG) showed a third-degree heart block and ST elevation in II, III and avF. In the initial and in the control laboratory investigation values of cardiac enzymes (creatininkinase and Troponine T) remained normal. The control ECG after 30 minutes turned back to normal. After one day the patient was submitted back to a normal ward.\nSymptomatic bradyarrhythmia and clinical sign of an myocardial infarction are rare but important cardiac side effects in patients treated with Taxol. Those patients should be under intensive care unit until patients conditions improve and acute myocardial ischemia has been excluded.","title":"Symptoms and signs of an acute myocardial ischemia caused by chemotherapy with Paclitaxel (Taxol) in a patient with metastatic ovarian carcinoma.","pubmedId":"16354605"}
