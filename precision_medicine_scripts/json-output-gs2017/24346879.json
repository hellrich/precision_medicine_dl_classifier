She reported a history of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, melanoma and multiple benign tumors and cysts. PTEN gene analysis was performed and confirmed Cowden Syndrome, a rare genodermatosis with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, characterized by multiple hamartomas. The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene negatively regulates cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Loss of PTEN function contributes to an increased risk of cancer. We emphasize the importance of early detection and accurate management of Cowden Syndrome. ","title":"Cowden Syndrome: report of a case and brief review of literature.","pubmedId":"24346879"}
