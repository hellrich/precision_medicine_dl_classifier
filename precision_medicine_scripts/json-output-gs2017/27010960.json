This multicenter prospective study aimed to investigate the role of KRAS mutation subtypes within the primary tumor to determine the prognosis of advanced pancreatic cancer.\nThe exon-2 KRAS mutation status was tested on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy material (primary tumor; restriction fragment-length polymorphism plus sequencing and TaqMan allelic discrimination) of patients with proven locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We used the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox\u0027s model to evaluate the impact of KRAS status on the overall survival (OS), adjusting for age, stage of disease, clinical performance status, CA 19-9 levels, and treatment.\nA total of 219 patients (men: 116; mean age: 67Â±9.4 years) were included: 147 harbored a codon-12 KRAS mutation (G12D: 73; G12V: 53; G12R: 21) and 72 had a wild-type KRAS. There was no difference in the OS between patients with a mutant KRAS (8 months; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 8.7-12.3) and the wild-type (9 months; 95% CI: 8.7-12.8; hazard ratio (HR): 1.03; P\u003d0.82). However, the patients with a G12D mutation had a significantly shorter OS (6 months; 95% CI: 6.4-9.7) compared with the other patients (OS: 9 months; 95% CI: 10-13; HR: 1.47; P\u003d0.003; i.e., wild type: 9 months, G12V: 9 months, G12R: 14 months). Similar results were observed in the subgroup of 162 patients who received chemotherapy (HR: 1.66; P\u003d0.0013; G12D (n\u003d49): 8 months, wild type (n\u003d56): 10 months, G12V (n\u003d38): 10 months, G12R (n\u003d19): 14 months). Multivariate analyses identified KRAS G12D as an independent predictor for worse prognosis within the entire series (HR: 1.44; P\u003d0.01) and in the subgroup of patients that received chemotherapy (HR: 1.84; P\u003d0.02).\nThe KRAS G12D mutation subtype is an independent prognostic marker for advanced pancreatic ductal carcinoma. Codon and amino-acid-specific mutations of KRAS should be considered when evaluating the prognoses as well as in trials testing drugs that target RAS and downstream RAS pathways.","title":"KRAS G12D Mutation Subtype Is A Prognostic Factor for Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27010960"}
