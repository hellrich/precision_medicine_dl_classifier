Here we report the generation of a specific anti-ErbB3 antibody intended for use in diagnosing disease or therapeutic application. By using the hybridoma technique, one cell line (2E(12)C(3)) stably producing anti-ErbB3 antibody was obtained. Its molecular weight was about 185 kDa and its isotype was IgG 2a and κ, respectively. The affinity constant (Kaff) of the anti-ErbB3 MAb was 5.83×10(10) M(-1). This antibody may become a useful tool for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting of ErbB3-expressing cancers or helpful in highlighting the etiology of schizophrenia.","title":"Therapeutic use of an anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibody.","pubmedId":"22741577"}
