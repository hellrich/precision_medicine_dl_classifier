However, mechanisms underlying the development of lung cancer metastasis remain unknown. Using genome-wide transcriptional analysis in an experimental metastasis model, we identified laminin γ2 (LAMC2), an epithelial basement membrane protein, to be significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma metastatic cells. Elevated LAMC2 increased traction force, migration, and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells accompanied by the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). LAMC2 knockdown decreased traction force, migration, and invasion accompanied by EMT reduction in vitro, and attenuated metastasis in mice. LAMC2 promoted migration and invasion via EMT that was integrin β1- and ZEB1-dependent. High LAMC2 was significantly correlated with the mesenchymal marker vimentin expression in lung adenocarcinomas, and with higher risk of recurrence or death in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. We suggest that LAMC2 promotes metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma via EMT and may be a potential therapeutic target.
