Dilution experiments using DNA from tumor cell lines or from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue were performed to assess assay sensitivity. Using 50 ng of total DNA (mutant and wild-type), the KRAS-BRAF StripAssay demonstrated a detection limit of 1% mutant sequence in a background of wild-type DNA. With respect to BRAF V600E, the KRAS-BRAF StripAssay was evaluated using 60 FFPE CRC samples previously analyzed by high resolution melting (HRM). Test strip hybridization identified 2/60 (3%) samples to carry the BRAF V600E mutation, and results were in agreement with those obtained by HRM analysis. This work demonstrates the KRAS-BRAF StripAssay to be a robust and sensitive method for the detection of common KRAS/BRAF mutations in genomic DNA isolated from FFPE tissue samples.","title":"Duplex reverse-hybridization assay for the simultaneous detection of KRAS/BRAF mutations in FFPE-extracted genomic DNA from colorectal cancer specimens.","pubmedId":"23324583"}
