There have been definitive, randomized, controlled lung-cancer chemoprevention trials in the three chemoprevention trial settings: primary (healthy high-risk [eg, smokers]), secondary (premalignant lesions), and tertiary (prevention of second primary tumors in previously treated patients), all of which produced negative (either neutral or harmful) primary end point results. These trials established that lung cancer was not prevented by alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, retinol, retinyl palmitate, N-acetylcysteine, or isotretinoin in smokers. Provocative leads of the definitive trials include the possible activity of isotretinoin in never and former smokers and that of alpha-tocopherol in prostate cancer prevention. A major area of lung cancer research is molecular epidemiologic study of highest smoking-related risk based on the interactions between tobacco carcinogens, genetic polymorphisms involved in activating and detoxifying these carcinogens, and host-cell efficiency in monitoring and repairing tobacco carcinogen-DNA damage. The future of lung cancer chemoprevention will rely heavily on molecular studies of carcinogenesis and drug mechanisms to develop novel chemopreventive targets and drugs, risk markers, and surrogate end point biomarkers; new preclinical drug-testing models; novel imaging techniques for monitoring agent activity; and molecular epidemiologic risk models for identifying the highest-risk current and former smokers.","title":"Lung cancer chemoprevention: an integrated approach.","pubmedId":"11560978"}
