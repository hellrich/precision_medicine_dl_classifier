Colon cancer was induced by administration of four weekly doses of AOM (15 mg/kg of body weight per week) separated by a one-week break between the second and third injections. As the histopathologic characteristics of this model resemble those of the human counterpart, further characterization of the genetic changes was undertaken. The animals were euthanized 28 to 29 weeks after the first AOM injection, and tumor specimens were taken for histologic and DNA analyses. Since microsatellite variation was found in only a few (\u003c 2%) specimens, the model can be considered as having stable microsatellites. This result is in accordance with those of similar studies in other rat models and with most human colorectal cancers. Immunohistochemical analyses of beta-catenin did not reveal loss of gene activity, nor did the sequencing of Ki-ras reveal mutations. These results are in contrast to most findings in comparable rat studies. The deviations may be due to differences in exposure to the carcinogen or difference in strain and/or age. The lack of beta-catenin and Ki-ras alterations in this colon cancer model is unlike human sporadic colorectal cancers where these genetic changes are common findings.","title":"Analysis of beta-catenin, Ki-ras, and microsatellite stability in azoxymethane-induced colon tumors of BDIX/Orl Ico rats.","pubmedId":"14727811"}
