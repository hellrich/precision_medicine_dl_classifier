Recently, the NF2 gene, which causes neurofibromatosis type 2 and which is located in the affected region on chromosome 22, has been identified. A previous study on 8 of the 17 exons of the NF2 gene described mutations in 16% of meningiomas. We have analyzed the entire coding region of the NF2 gene in 70 sporadic meningiomas and identified 43 mutations in 41 patients. These resulted predominantly in immediate truncation, splicing abnormalities, or an altered reading frame of the predicted protein product. Although there was no evidence for distinct hotspots, all mutations occurred in the first 13 exons, the region of homology with the filopodial proteins moesin, ezrin, and radixin. The association of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22 with mutations in the NF2 gene was significant. These data suggest that NF2 represents the meningioma locus on chromosome 22. NF2 mutations occurred significantly more frequently in fibroblastic meningioma (70%) and transitional meningioma (83%) than in meningiothelial meningioma (25%), thus indicating a differential molecular pathogenesis of these meningioma variants.","title":"Analysis of the neurofibromatosis 2 gene reveals molecular variants of meningioma.","pubmedId":"7717450"}
