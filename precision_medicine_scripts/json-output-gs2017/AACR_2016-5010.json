Genomic alterations, such as PIK3CA mutations, are important for response to therapy in HER2+ breast cancer (BC). We have investigated genomic alterations in 364 pretherapeutic core biopsies from two prospective clinical trials with or without anti-HER2 therapy.Methods: A total of 417 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples from HER2+ tumors of the neoadjuvant GeparTrio (G3 without anti-HER2 treatment) and GeparSepto (G7 with dual blockade and randomization for paclitaxel vs nab-paclitaxel) study were analyzed by deep targeted massive parallel sequencing, which was successful in 364 tumors (87%). We interrogated hot spot regions of 22 genes (including TP53, PIK3CA, CDH1, FBXW7, PTEN, AKT1, ATM, BRAF, EGFR, ESR1, FGFR2, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, SF3B1) with a minimum coverage of 500. Only non-synonymous mutations with allele frequencies 10% were taken into consideration.Results: A total of 291 non-synonymously mutated genes were detected in the 364 tumor samples, the most commonly mutated genes were TP53 (47%), and PIK3CA (24%), respectively. EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, HRAS were combined to the XRAS group with 9 (2.5%) mutations. 151 tumors had no, 148 one, 57 two, and 8 tumors three or more mutated genes. There were no statistical significant differences between HR+ and HR- HER2+ tumors; overall 141/252 HR+ and 72/112 HR- tumors had a mutation. HR+ tumors had TP53 mutations in 112/252 (44.4%); PIK3CA mutations in 53/252 (21.0%) and XRAS mutations in 5/252 (2.0%). HR- tumors had 60/112 (53.6%) TP53 mutations, 34/112 (30.4%) PIK3CA mutations and 4/112 (3.6%) xRAS mutations.Response rates (pCR, ypT0 ypN0) were evaluated separately for the two trials. In G7 the pCR rate was 64.7% in the group with a TP53 mutation vs 60.6% in the group without (p \u003d 0.545). The pCR rate was significantly lower in the PIK3CA mutant vs wild type (wt) group (47.7% vs 66.7%; p \u003d 0.009). This effect was seen in the HR+ (43.9% vs 61.3%; p \u003d 0.052) and the HR- cohort (54.2% vs 80.0%; p \u003d 0.029). In the nab-paclitaxel cohort, pCR rates were significantly lower in patients with PIK3CA mutations compared to those without (38.7% vs. 72.0%; p \u003d 0.001), whereas in the paclitaxel group, there was no significant difference between patients with and without PIK3CA mutations (55.9% vs. 60.9%; p \u003d 0.690; interaction p \u003d 0.039). Neither TP53 nor xRAS mutations showed a significant effect on response and treatment effect. In G3 the pCR rate was 16.3% in the PIK3CA wt cohort compared to 23.7% in the mutant cohort; p \u003d 0.339.Conclusion: Targeted NGS on FFPE core biopsies reliably identified the most common genomic alterations in HER+ BC. PIK3CA mutation in HER2+ BC predicts resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. PIK3CA mutations were found to be predictive for response to nab-paclitaxel in G7. The results show that mutational alterations are relevant for response in HER2+ BC.","title":"Prediction of therapy resistance by targeted massive-parallel sequencing in primary HER2-positive breast cancer","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-5010"}
