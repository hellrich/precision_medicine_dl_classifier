The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression model.\nThe frequency of the STK15 Ile/Ile genotype was significantly higher in cancer cases than in controls (50.2% vs. 36.8%; P \u003d 0.02). Subjects with the Ile/Ile genotype had an increased risk for the occurrence of colorectal cancer compared with those with the STK15 Phe/Phe genotype (adjusted OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.13 - 3.27). No significant association was observed between this STK15 polymorphism and risk of metastasis of the cancer.\nThese findings suggest that STK15 Phe/Ile polymorphism may be a genetic susceptibility factor for colorectal cancer among Chinese.","title":"[Association between genetic polymorphism in STK15 and risk of colorectal cancer in a Chinese population].","pubmedId":"16737620"}
