Clinical absence of central nervous system involvement and a normal computerized tomographic scan of the brain favor the neoplasm as being a primary extracranial meningioma. Light and electron microscopy showed characteristic structural features. A brief review of the literature is made, and theories concerning the origin of extracranial primary meningioma are presented.","title":"Mediastinal meningioma.","pubmedId":"534392"}
