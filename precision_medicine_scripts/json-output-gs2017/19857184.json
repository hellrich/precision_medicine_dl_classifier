Gene therapy is currently regarded as a potential and promising therapeutic modality for pancreatic cancer.\nThis article summarizes an update of gene therapy approaches and reviews the latest progress in gene delivery systems that have been tested on pancreatic cancer.\nThe treatment effectiveness of gene combination therapy is better than that of the regulation of single-gene or single gene therapy approaches. Naked DNA is limited because of degradation by intracellular and extracellular nucleases. Virus vectors show high transfection efficiency but are limited due to immunogenicity, inflammatory response and potential carcinogenicity. Non-viral vectors, such as cationic polymers or inorganic nanoparticles, show an important feature that they can be easily modified, and the progress of materials science will provide more and better non-viral vectors, accordingly improving the efficiency and safety of gene therapy, which will make them the most promising vectors for pancreatic cancer.","title":"Pancreatic cancer: gene therapy approaches and gene delivery systems.","pubmedId":"19857184"}
