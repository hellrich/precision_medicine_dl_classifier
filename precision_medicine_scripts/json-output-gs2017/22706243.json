We screened 49 PA tissues to be subsequently sequenced to confirm the mutations. Simultaneously, we tested the specimens using Sanger sequencing and then used target-DNA cloning and sequencing for verification.\nIt was found that unlabeled-probe HRM was reliable in detecting 3% of mutant cell lines DNA diluted with that of the wild-type, whereas Sanger sequencing could only discriminate 20% mutant cell ratios. In detecting 49 specimens, the former was capable of detecting 23 mutations (46.9%); and the latter could observe 15 (30.6%). For further verification, T-A DNA cloning and sequencing was applied to the differences, with the results matching those of the unlabeled-probe HRM.\nIt was concluded that the unlabeled-probe HRM approach can be a sensitive and accurate screening technique to detect KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations in diagnosing and treating PA.","title":"Unlabeled-probe high-resolution melting to detect KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues.","pubmedId":"22706243"}
