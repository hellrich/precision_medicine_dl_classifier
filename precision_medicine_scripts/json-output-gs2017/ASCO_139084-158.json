Methods:  We designed a phase 2 open-label, non-comparative, multicenter study (NCT01204372). Patients received weekly 1000 mg/m gemcitabine (3 weeks out of 4), weekly trastuzumab (4 mg/kg the first week, 2 mg/kg afterwards) and erlotinib 100 mg/day per os.  The primary endpoint was the disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST. Using a Flemings single-stage procedure, the trial was considered positive if 29 patients had a controlled disease (out of 57 evaluable patients). Secondary endpoints included the safety, the progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS). An ancillary study addressed the EGFR, HER2 and KRAS status of the patients.   Results:  Between June 2010 and July 2013, 62 patients were recruited (37 men). The median age was 62 years (range 35-77). Performance status was 0 (n\u003d27) and 1 (n\u003d35). 10 patients had had a surgery of the primary tumor (PT), of whom 6 had been treated with a gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy (\u003e 6-month delay). PT were localized in the head (n\u003d25), corpus (n\u003d22) and tail (n\u003d15) of pancreas. The number of metastatic sites varied from 1 (n\u003d25) to  3 (n\u003d15). The baseline median left ventricular ejection fraction was 65% (range 51-86%).  All patients were evaluable for safety and 59 patients for efficacy. Main first cycle treatment-related toxicities included: grade 3 anorexia (27%), asthenia (13%), diarrhea (10%), anemia (6%), and thrombocytopenia (3%); grade 3-4 neutropenia (24%), and mucositis (6%); grade 2-3 cutaneous events (35%). No complete responses were observed. 11 patients had a partial response, 33 a stable disease and 15 a disease progression. Therefore, the DCR was 74.6% (95%CI: 61.6-85.0%). Definitive results for the secondary endpoints will be presented at the meeting.  Conclusions:  Our results showed that combining gemcitabine, trastuzumab and erlotinib is efficient in terms of DCR. A further study is necessary to investigate this promising association. Funding (Roche SAS).
