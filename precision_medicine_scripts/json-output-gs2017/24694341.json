The median age in the KRAS mutation group was 69 years (range, 43-86 years), and male to female ratio was 1:2.3. The proportion of heavy smokers was significantly higher in tumors with KRAS mutation compared with wild type (83% versus 62%; P \u003d .01). A total of 27% of tumors with KRAS mutation had pleural invasion versus 11% of tumors without KRAS mutation (P \u003d .009). A total of 59 tumor samples were positive for KRAS mutation (25 for G12C, 14 for G12A, 8 for G12V, 7 for G12D, 3 for G12S, and 1 for G12T), and only 3 tumors harbored codon 13 mutations (G13C). Two tumors had double mutations.\nKRAS mutations are more common in heavy smokers, and lung adenocarcinomas with KRAS mutation are more likely to invade the visceral pleura. Increased frequency of visceral pleural invasion may explain in part the worse prognosis associated with KRAS mutations.","title":"Peripheral lung adenocarcinomas with KRAS mutations are more likely to invade visceral pleura.","pubmedId":"24694341"}
