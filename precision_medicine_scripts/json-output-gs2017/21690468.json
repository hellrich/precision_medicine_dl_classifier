We tested the efficiency of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in selected patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit mutations or amplifications.\nForty-three patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit aberrations were enrolled on this phase II trial. Each patient received a continuous dose of imatinib 400 mg/d unless intolerable toxicities or disease progression occurred. Fifteen patients who experienced progression of disease were allowed to escalate the dose to 800 mg/d.\nForty-three patients were eligible for evaluation, and the median follow-up time was 12.0 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months, and the 6-month PFS rate was 36.6%. Rate of total disease control was 53.5%: 10 patients (23.3%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 36.4%) and 13 patients (30.2%; 95% CI, 16.0% to 44.4%) achieved partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), respectively. Eighteen patients (41.9%) demonstrated regression of tumor mass. Notably, nine of the 10 PRs were observed in patients with mutations in exons 11 or 13. The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 51.0%. The median PFS and OS times for patients who had PR or SD versus disease progression were 9.0 months versus 1.5 months (P \u003c .001) and 15.0 months versus 9.0 months (P \u003d .036), respectively. Imatinib 400 mg/d was well tolerated, and only one of the 15 patients who received dose escalation to 800 mg/d achieved SD.\nImatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring genetic c-Kit aberrations, with an overall response rate of 23.3%. Escalation to 800 mg/d could not restore disease control.","title":"Phase II, open-label, single-arm trial of imatinib mesylate in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit mutation or amplification.","pubmedId":"21690468"}
