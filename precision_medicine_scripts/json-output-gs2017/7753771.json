The symptoms did not improve under conservative therapy of an accompanying COPD. Thus, in spite of two heart attacks in the previous history, an operation with bullectomy was indicated. A thoracotomy had to be avoided because of the very high cardiac risk. In the present case, a minimally invasive procedure enabled the complete cyst resection with a smooth postoperative course and an excellent functional therapeutic result.","title":"[Minimally invasive surgery of large bullous pulmonary emphysema].","pubmedId":"7753771"}
