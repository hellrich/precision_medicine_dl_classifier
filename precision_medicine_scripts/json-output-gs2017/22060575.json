{"genes":["pork loin","Loin"],"organisms":["9823"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Boneless loins from both sides of 20 pig carcasses were divided into five sections each and assigned equally to five packaging treatments: 100 % CO(2); 50 % CO(2)/50 % N(2); 25 % CO(2)/ 75 % N(2); 25 % CO(2)/65 % N(2)/10 % O(2) and vacuum. Loin sections were packaged in bags of low O(2) permeability, then stored in darkness at 1 °C for up to 22 days. Retail chops were cut from the sections and displayed in oxygen-permeable film under light at 3 °C for 3 additional days. The O(2) concentrations in packages with nominally anoxic atmospheres were 0.1-0.4 %. Sections stored in 25 % CO(2)/65 % N(2)/10 % O(2) had more surface greying and greening, stronger off-odour and psychrotropic counts after storage were more than one log(10) higher compared to sections from the other four treatments. Displayed chops from sections stored in 25 % CO(2)/65 % N(2)/10 % O(2) also had greying/greening at an outer layer of the chops. Off-odour of chops was most pronounced for treatments with 10 % O(2) and vacuum. Drip loss from loin sections was highest for those in 100 % CO(2) (4.2 %) and lowest for those in vacuum (3.2 %). In conclusion, storage in CO(2) or CO (2)N (2) atmospheres benefitted the overall shelf life of pork.","title":"Effects of modified gas atmosphere packaging on pork loin colour, display life and drip loss.","pubmedId":"22060575"}
