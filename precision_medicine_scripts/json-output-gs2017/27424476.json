This might be due to the pronounced immunosuppressive milieu impairing infiltration and function of immune effector cells. This study aimed at a comprehensive analysis of immune cells in PDAC patients by determining absolute and relative peripheral blood cell numbers of immune cell subsets along with their functional capacity.\nWhole blood cells or isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were characterized by flow cytometry. PDAC tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Anti-tumor activity of immune effector cells was determined by RTCA system.\nOur data demonstrate that relative CD4+ memory- and regulatory T cell numbers were enhanced, whereas determination of absolute cell numbers revealed generally lower immune cell numbers in PDAC patients compared to healthy controls. γδ T cells accumulated at higher numbers compared to αβ T cells in the malignant ductal epithelium of PDAC tissues indicating that γδ T cells infiltrate into the tumor. Cytotoxicity against tumor cells of even small numbers of T- and NK cells could be induced by a bispecific antibody targeting CD3+ T cells to human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 expressing PDAC cells or Trastuzumab. Importantly, a critical number of γδ T cells was required for significant tumor cell killing by a bispecific antibody engaging the γδ T cell receptor on γδ T cells and HER2 on tumor cells.\nMonitoring immune cells along with the determination of their functional capacity provides a comprehensive assessment as a prerequisite for a personalized immunotherapeutic PDAC treatment.","title":"Monitoring and functional characterization of the lymphocytic compartment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients.","pubmedId":"27424476"}
