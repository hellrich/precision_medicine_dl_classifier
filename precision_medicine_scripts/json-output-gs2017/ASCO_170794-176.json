Methods: Archival FFPE samples from patients who consented prospectively to study were analyzed using the MSK-IMPACT platform, a hybridization capture based next generation sequencing assay for targeted deep sequencing of all exons and selected introns of 410 key cancer genes. Tumor and matched normal libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Sequencing output was processed using a custom analysis pipeline. Demographic and treatment data was prospectively collected. Fishers exact tests were performed to look for MEGA and associations between clinical characteristics and genetic alterations. Results: 137 pts were studied: 78% EHC and 22% IHC; 50% male, from metastatic sample (70%) and primary (30%). Median mutations per sample: 3, median sample coverage was 680X. Most commonly altered genes in IHC were IDH1 (30%), ARID1A (23%) BAP1 (20%), p53 (20%) and FGFR2 gene fusions (14%), Tendency towards MEGA was seen between multiple genes in IHC including TP53:IDH1 (p \u003d 0.01), IDH1:KRAS (p \u003d .03), TP53:BAP1 (p \u003d 0.03), IDH1:FGFR2 (p \u003d 0.04). Genetic alterations more common to EHC versus IHC included KRAS, SMAD4, STK11 and p53 (p \u003c 0.05). FGFR2 fusions and BAP1 alterations were not identified in EHC. 120 pts received 1st line chemotherapy for advanced disease (77% gemcitabine/platinum), median TTP was 9.1 months and did not differ for pts with IDH1 mutations or FGFR2 gene fusions. Conclusions: Distinct patterns of genetic alterations and MEGA both within IHC and between IHC and EHC were identified. Response to 1st line chemotherapy did not differ between different molecular subgroups; these prospective data provide a contemporary benchmark for better understanding and development of targeted therapies in molecularly profiled IHC and EHC.","title":"Comprehensive molecular profiling and analysis of mutual exclusivity of genetic aberrations (MEGA) of intra- and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (IHC and EHC) evaluation of prognostic features and potential targets for intervention.","pubmedId":"ASCO_170794-176"}
