Survivors of acute myocardial infarction with compensated or mild congestive heart failure, including those on digitalis and diuretics, were included in the study. A history of congestive heart failure before randomization characterized 710 (18.5%) patients: 345 (18.0%) in the propranolol group and 365 (19.0%) in the placebo group. The incidence of definite congestive heart failure after randomization and during the study was 6.7% in both groups. In patients with a history of congestive heart failure before randomization, 51 of 345 (14.8%) in the propranolol group and 46 of 365 (12.6%) in the placebo group developed congestive heart failure during an average 25 month follow-up. In the patients with no history of congestive heart failure, 5% in the propranolol group developed congestive heart failure and 5.3% in the placebo group developed congestive heart failure. Baseline characteristics predictive of the occurrence of congestive heart failure by multivariate analyses included an increased cardiothoracic ratio, diabetes, increased heart rate, low baseline weight, prior myocardial infarction, age, and more than 10 ventricular premature beats per hour.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Effect of propranolol after acute myocardial infarction in patients with congestive heart failure.","pubmedId":"3948357"}
