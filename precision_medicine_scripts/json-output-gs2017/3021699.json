No transformation was observed with the normal skin fibroblast DNA, while the KMS-4 cell DNA was able to transform NIH3T3 cells. Through hybridization with known oncogene probes, the KMS-4 transforming gene was found to be a human activated c-K-ras 2 oncogene. Sequence analysis of the molecularly cloned KMS-4 c-K-ras 2 oncogene showed a single nucleotide transition from G to T at the 12th codon. This results in substitution of cysteine for glycine at this position. On using labeled synthetic oligonucleotides to detect the mutation in codon 12, we found the G to T transition in colon carcinoma cells. This suggests that activation of the c-K-ras 2 oncogene could be associated with colon carcinoma induction.","title":"Colon carcinoma K-ras 2 oncogene of a familial polyposis coli patient.","pubmedId":"3021699"}
