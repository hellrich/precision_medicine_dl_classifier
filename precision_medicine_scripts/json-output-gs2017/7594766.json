We analyzed 12 human pancreatic cancer cell lines by Northern blot analysis for the expression of 9 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) and 6 growth factors. The effect of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) on in vitro pancreatic cancer cell growth was also assessed, mRNA for EGF-R, c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 was expressed in 12 (100%), 12 (100%), and 7 (58%), respectively, of the cell lines examined. In addition, 8 (67%) cell lines expressed the c-met/receptor for hepatocyte growth factor. As for ligands, TGF-alpha mRNA was detected in 10 (83%) cell lines; MAb against TGF-alpha inhibited growth of the 2 cell lines examined. Furthermore, mRNA for amphiregulin (AR) was expressed in 10 (83%) cell lines. Coexpression of TGF-alpha, AR, and EGF-R was observed in 9 (75%) cell lines. These results support the concept that several specified types of RTKs and their ligands are closely involved in regulation of the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells.","title":"Frequent expression of genes for receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands in human pancreatic cancer cells.","pubmedId":"7594766"}
