Preliminary results of Herceptin with other agents such as vinorelbine, cisplatin and various hormonal agents are also promising, and these combinations warrant further clinical exploration. Large-scale multicenter trials including a European and an international study in adjuvant setting have started for high-risk women with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer, with total planned recruitment of nearly 10,000 women.","title":"[Herceptin and its therapeutic strategy in patients with breast cancer overexpressing HER2].","pubmedId":"12145992"}
