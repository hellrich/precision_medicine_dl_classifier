Adjuvant brachytherapy in combination with sublobar resection is a promising approach that seems to decrease local recurrence rates similar to that reported following lobectomy. If the results of the current American College of Surgeons Oncology Group randomized trial are favorable, it may be possible in the future to define subgroups of patients with stage I NSCLC who are able to be treated with this approach in preference to lobectomy. Until further data are available, lobectomy should remain the standard of care. RFA is an alternative for the high-risk patient with NSCLC who is considered too high-risk even for sublobar resection. Although long-term results are not yet available, it does seem that local recurrence is a significant problem. In a similar fashion to the approach currently being investigated with sublobar resection, the addition of radiation may improve local control after RFA. In particular, adjuvant stereotactic radiation should be investigated as a potential method of decreasing local recurrence and preserving lung function in these high-risk patients.","title":"Role of adjuvant radiation (external beam/brachytherapy) for stage I NSCLC.","pubmedId":"17626405"}
