Although preclinical data suggest that sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI) is decreased in EGFR-mutant lung cancers also harboring a PIK3CA mutation, this interaction has not been explored clinically.\nPatients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring a PIK3CA mutation concurrent with a separate driver mutation were identified through mutational hotspot testing, multiplex sizing assays, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Overall survival and outcomes with EGFR TKI monotherapy (EGFR-mutant) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between double-mutant (EGFR-mutant or KRAS-mutant, concurrent PIK3CA-mutant) and single-mutant patients (EGFR-mutant or KRAS-mutant, PIK3CA wild-type) using log-rank tests.\nIn EGFR-mutant and KRAS-mutant lung cancers, a concurrent PIK3CA mutation was associated with a decrease in median overall survival: 18 versus 33 months (EGFR double mutant, n \u003d 10 versus single mutant, n \u003d 43, p \u003d 0.006), and 9 versus 16 months (KRAS double mutant, n \u003d 16 versus single mutant, n \u003d 47, p \u003d 0.020). In EGFR-mutant lung cancers, a concurrent PIK3CA mutation did not impact benefit from EGFR TKI monotherapy. Single versus double mutant: objective response rate, 83% (n \u003d 29) versus 62% (n \u003d 6, p \u003d 0.80); median time to progression, 11 (n \u003d 29) versus 8 months (n \u003d 6, p \u003d 0.84); and median duration of TKI therapy, 15 (n \u003d 32) versus 15 months (n \u003d 10, p \u003d 0.65).\nA concurrent PIK3CA mutation is a poor prognostic factor in patients with advanced EGFR-mutant or KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas. There was no evidence that clinical benefit from EGFR TKI monotherapy is affected by a concurrent PIK3CA mutation in EGFR-mutant lung cancers.","title":"Impact of Concurrent PIK3CA Mutations on Response to EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition in EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancers and on Prognosis in Oncogene-Driven Lung Adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"26334752"}
