The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer 1 (ESPAC1) trial is the largest study of adjuvant treatment to date. The results of ESPAC1 are discussed in the context of other evidence from previous randomized studies, which have also been combined in a meta-analysis. Overall, the existing data show a clear benefit for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, which has not been demonstrated for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The subgroup of patients with resection margin positive disease did seem to benefit less from adjuvant chemotherapy, and showed a trend towards improved survival with chemoradiotherapy. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be evaluated further in this latter group of patients. The optimal chemotherapy regimen for use as adjuvant treatment is the subject of ongoing trials. Other strategies which should be explored include neoadjuvant treatment and the incorporation of novel targeted agents into management.","title":"Adjuvant treatment for resectable pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"16002844"}
