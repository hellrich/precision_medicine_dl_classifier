Although a selective coronary angiogram showed no atherosclerotic lesions, coronary spasm was provoked by acetylcholine in the left coronary artery, accompanied by chest pain and depression of blood pressure. This is the youngest healthy young female to be diagnosed with coronary vasospasm by provocation test. Because there are no risk factors, the vasospasm must be related to unknown hereditary factors.","title":"Vasospastic angina in a 16-year-old female.","pubmedId":"12736490"}
