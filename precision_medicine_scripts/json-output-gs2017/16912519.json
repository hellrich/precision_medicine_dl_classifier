The prognosis of patients with metastatic lung cancer to bones is short,usually less than 6 months. The treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and medical therapy with analgesics and bisphosphonates. Radiotherapy for metastatic bone tumor is a mainstay to relieve pain and control the localized disease. Doses in the range of 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions are acceptable in most circumstances. Prophylactic fixation for long bone fractures is recommended in cases where 30 to 50% of the cortex has been destroyed, pain is present after radiotherapy, or life expectancy is more than 3 months. Systemic chemotherapy has been proved to prolong survival of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as extensive small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Combination chemotherapy of platinum and a new drug is recommended in NSCLC patients with good performance status (PS). Gefitinib in upfront or second-line treatment is an optional therapy in adenocarcinoma patients without a history of smoking. Cisplatin combined with etoposide or irinotecan is a standard therapy in SCLC patients with PS 0 or 1. Carboplatin and etoposide is a treatment of choice in SCLC patients with PS 2 or 3. Medical management of cancer pain requires nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. Cancer pain that necessitates more than 120 mg of oral morphine is morphine-resistant pain and requires some adjuvant drugs such as corticosteroids, ketamine,anticonvulsants, or local anesthetics. The third generation bisphosphonate zoledronate has been demonstrated to improve cancer pain and to prevent skeletal morbidity in lung cancer patients with metastatic bone disease.","title":"[Lung cancer with bone metastasis].","pubmedId":"16912519"}
