They are observed primarily by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and are characterized by an intraductal papillary neoplasm that secretes thick mucin, causing pancreatic duct dilatation and obstructive pancreatitis.\nTwenty patients are presented, 14 male and six female, with an average age of 59 +/- 11 years. All patients presented with abdominal pain, and most had nausea and vomiting, weight loss, and documented pancreatitis. Of the preoperative studies, ERCP was positive in all patients. Computed tomography scan, endoscopic ultrasonogram, and cytologic findings were less sensitive. Tumor markers were only positive in one patient. All 20 patients were treated surgically. Nine underwent Whipple procedure, one patient had a total pancreatectomy, and nine had distal pancreatic resections. The first patient in the series did not have a pancreatic resection, and his disease evolved into a lethal cystadenocarcinoma causing his death 99 months later.\nHistopathologic findings were interpreted as borderline malignant in 17 of the 20 patients, and three patients had evidence of invasive adenocarcinoma. Two of these three patients had nodal or distant metastases at the time of diagnosis, and all three died of adenocarcinoma. Seventeen of the patients are alive and well, although two of three with positive pancreatic margins have had recurrent symptoms and have been successfully reresected.\nThe mucin-producing intraductal papillary tumor of the pancreas is a newly described variant of pancreatic cancer. It presents with symptoms of pancreatitis and has a progressive but more indolent course than the more lethal invasive ductal cancers. Patients with unexplained pancreatitis should undergo ERCP investigation, and aggressive surgical therapy should be carried out because the prognosis for this lesion, when appropriately treated, is more favorable than the usual pancreatic cancer.","title":"Mucin-hypersecreting intraductal neoplasms of the pancreas: a precursor to cystic pancreatic malignancies.","pubmedId":"9347857"}
