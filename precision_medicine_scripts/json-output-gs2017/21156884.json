Percentage of patients with CHF receiving required quality-of-care items since the date of diagnosis.\nThe DELPHI database contained information on 60 (65.9%) of the 91 items identified using the CHF flow sheet. The recommended tests and procedures were recorded infrequently: 55.5% of patients with CHF had chest radiographs; 32.6% had electrocardiograms; 32.2% had echocardiograms; 30.5% were prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; 20.9% were prescribed Î²-blockers; and 15.8% were prescribed angiotensin II receptor blockers.\nLow frequencies of recommended care items for patients with CHF were recorded in the EMR. Physicians explained that CHF care was documented in areas of the EMR that contained patient identifiers, such as the encounter notes, and was therefore not part of the DELPHI database. Extractable information from the EMR does not provide a complete picture of the quality of care provided to patients with CHF.","title":"Quality of congestive heart failure care: assessing measurement of care using electronic medical records.","pubmedId":"21156884"}
