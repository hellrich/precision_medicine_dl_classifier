Diagnosis and classification is moving away from histopathological grading and staging towards molecular categorization of the tumor. Detection of genetic alterations in cancer facilitates selecting targeted therapies, increasing the demand for identifying actionable mutations in clinical specimens. Next-generation sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique to detect genetic variations in oncology samples. Methods: We used Illuminas investigational Praxis Oncology Panel 15 (OGP) and the MiSeqDx system to analyze molecular alterations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. We analyzed 140 FFPE samples from different tissues using 20 ng of DNA per sample. Results: The assay results showed an overall 87% success rate; 122/140 samples generated sequencing data. Of 18 unsuccessful samples, one (0.7%) had less than 20 ng of DNA and was excluded from library preparation; 14 (10.1%) failed library QC and were not sequenced; and 3 (2.2%) failed sequencing QC. Variant analysis showed that the assay can measure variant frequencies (VF) for single nucleotide variants as low as 3%. The results show the presence of KRAS-actionable variants p.A146P and p.Q61H, as well as variants p.G12S, p.G12D, p.G13D, p.G12V, p.G12C, p.G12R approved as biomarkers in companion diagnostics in colorectal cancer in adrenal, pancreas, and ovarian tissues. We identified BRAF variant p.V600E in colon and thyroid samples; and NRAS and TP53 variants were reported in several tissues. To evaluate precision, we studied a subset of samples to confirm that variant detection by the OGP was concordant across operators, instruments, and days. Overall percent agreement was 99.97% (3066/3067). Positive percent agreement was 99.16% (118/119) with one misclassified variant that had an allele frequency of 0.022 that missed the VF filter cutoff of 0.026. Negative percent agreement was 100.00% (2948/2948). Conclusions: Illuminas Praxis Oncology Panel 15 is capable of accurately and reproducibly detecting cancer-related variants at low VF in FFPE samples from solid tumors. *CAUTION  Investigational device.
