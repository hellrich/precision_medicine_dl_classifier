Our objectives are to report on our institutional experience regarding the clinico-pathological and prognostic features of CHCC-CC and to compare our results with published series. The clinico-pathological features and outcomes of 11 patients with CHCC-CC who had a complete surgical resection for primary liver cancer were reviewed. There were 8 male and 3 female patients. The overall median age was 61 years. Active hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections were present in 6 (54%) and 2 (18%) patients, respectively. Alcoholism was present in one case. Cirrhosis was present in 8 (72%) cases. There were no causative factors identified in 2 patients with non-cirrhotic livers. The median AFP value was 30.56 ng/ml. A single mass located in the right lobe and a single mass located in the left lobe of the liver was noted in 6 (54%) and 4 (36%) patients, respectively. Bilobar involvement was observed in one case. Major and minor resections were performed in 2 (18%) and 9 (81%) cases, respectively. The median tumour size was 3 cm. Tumours measuring \u003e5 cm were identified in only 2 (18%) cases. The majority of the cases were classified as stage I (54%) and stage II (36%). Four patients died 11-50 months after the surgery. Postoperative tumour recurrences were observed in 5 (45.45%) patients within 4 years of surgical resection. The overall 1- and 3-year survival rates in this series were 80% and 69.3%. Our series demonstrated cases of CHCC-CC with more favourable pathological traits and survival outcomes compared with similar studies.","title":"Clinicopathological factors impact the survival outcome following the resection of combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"23102615"}
