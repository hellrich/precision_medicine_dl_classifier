We report here the pharmacologic characterization of the triazolopyridazine derivative SAR125844, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), for intravenous administration. SAR125844 displayed nanomolar activity against the wild-type kinase (IC50 value of 4.2 nmol/L) and the M1250T and Y1235D mutants. Broad biochemical profiling revealed that SAR125844 was highly selective for MET kinase. SAR125844 inhibits MET autophosphorylation in cell-based assays in the nanomolar range, and promotes low nanomolar proapoptotic and antiproliferative activities selectively in cell lines with MET gene amplification or pathway addiction. In two MET-amplified human gastric tumor xenograft models, SNU-5 and Hs 746T, intravenous treatment with SAR125844 leads to potent, dose- and time-dependent inhibition of the MET kinase and to significant impact on downstream PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways. Long duration of MET kinase inhibition up to 7 days was achieved with a nanosuspension formulation of SAR125844. Daily or every-2-days intravenous treatment of SAR125844 promoted a dose-dependent tumor regression in MET-amplified human gastric cancer models at tolerated doses without treatment-related body weight loss. Our data demonstrated that SAR125844 is a potent and selective MET kinase inhibitor with a favorable preclinical toxicity profile, supporting its clinical development in patients with MET-amplified and MET pathway-addicted tumors.","title":"The selective intravenous inhibitor of the MET tyrosine kinase SAR125844 inhibits tumor growth in MET-amplified cancer.","pubmedId":"25504634"}
