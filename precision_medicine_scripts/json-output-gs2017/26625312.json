In light of recent experimental data showing that specific STK11 mutants could acquire oncogenic activities due to the synthesis of a short STK11 isoform, we investigated whether this new classification of STK11 mutants could help refine its role as a prognostic marker. We conducted a retrospective high-throughput genotyping study in 567 resected non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. STK11 exons 1 or 2 mutations (STK11ex1-2) with potential oncogenic activity were analyzed separately from exons 3 to 9 (STK11ex3-9). STK11ex1-2 and STK11ex3-9 mutations occurred in 5% and 14% of NSCLC. STK11 mutated patients were younger (P \u003d .01) and smokers (P\u003c .0001). STK11 mutations were significantly associated with KRAS and inversely with EGFR mutations. After a median follow-up of 7.2 years (95%CI 6.8-.4), patients with STK11ex1-2 mutation had a median OS of 24 months (95%CI 15-57) as compared to 69 months (95%CI 56-93) for wild-type (log-rank, P \u003d .005) and to 91 months (95%CI 57-unreached) for STK11ex3-9 mutations (P \u003d .003). In multivariate analysis, STK11ex1-2 mutations remained associated with a poor prognosis (P \u003d .002). Results were validated in two public datasets. Western blots showed that STK11ex1-2 mutatedtumors expressed short STK11 isoforms. Finally using mRNAseq data from the TCGA cohort, we showed that a stroma-derived poor prognosis signature was enriched in STK11ex1-2 mutated tumors. All together our results show that STK11ex1-2 mutations delineate an aggressive subtype of lung cancer for which a targeted treatment through STK11 inhibition might offer new opportunities.","title":"Different prognostic impact of STK11 mutations in non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"26625312"}
