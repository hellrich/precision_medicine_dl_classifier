Immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and CK20 were analyzed in the different morphological histotypes of ampullary cancers, and results were compared with overall survival.\nOf 72 ampullary cancers, 48.6% were classified as pancreaticobiliary-type carcinomas, 43.1% were classified as intestinal-type carcinomas, and 8.3% were classified as \"unusual\"-type carcinomas. Cytokeratin 20 was expressed in 28 (90.3%) of the 31 intestinal-type carcinomas, whereas it was always negative in the pancreaticobiliary histotype; CK7 was expressed in 32 (91.4%) of the 35 pancreaticobiliary-type carcinomas and in 18 (58.1%) of the 31 intestinal-type carcinomas. By univariate analysis, overall survival was influenced significantly by pathological T factor, lymph node involvement, and histological/immunohistochemical subtyping. Furthermore, using a multivariate Cox regression model, lymph node metastasis and CK20 were identified as significant independent factors related to prognosis.\nOur results prove the clinical use of ampullary cancer subclassification based on different histotypes and indicate the useful role of the CK7/CK20 expression profile for consistent histopathological classification and prognostic relevance.","title":"Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater: morphological and immunophenotypical classification predicts overall survival.","pubmedId":"22889982"}
