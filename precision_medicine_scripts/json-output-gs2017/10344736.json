Growth suppression induced by overexpression of MMAC1 in cells with mutant MMAC1 alleles is thought to be mediated by the inhibition of signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. However, the exact biochemical mechanisms by which MMAC1 exerts its growth-inhibitory effects are still unknown. Here we report that recombinant adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MMAC1 in three different MMAC1-mutant glioblastoma cell lines blocked progression from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Cell cycle arrest correlated with the recruitment of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p27Kip1, to cyclin E immunocomplexes, which resulted in a reduction in CDK2 kinase activities and a decrease in levels of endogenous phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. CDK4 kinase activities were unaffected, as were the levels of the CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 present in cyclin E immunocomplexes. Therefore, overexpression of MMAC1 via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer suppresses tumor cell growth through cell cycle inhibitory mechanisms, and as such, represents a potential therapeutic approach to treating glioblastomas.","title":"Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of MMAC1/PTEN to glioblastoma cells inhibits S phase entry by the recruitment of p27Kip1 into cyclin E/CDK2 complexes.","pubmedId":"10344736"}
