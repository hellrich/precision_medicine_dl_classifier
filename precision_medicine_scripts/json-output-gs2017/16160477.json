Genetically, they are characterized by amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 genes on chromosome 12q13-15. We examined a series of 559 soft tissue tumors (44 ALT-WDLPS, 61 DDLPS, 49 benign adipose tumors, and 405 non-ALT-WDLPS/DDLPS sarcomas) for MDM2 and CDK4 expression using immunohistochemistry. MDM2 and CDK4 immunoexpressions were compared with gene amplification status (as assessed by quantitative PCR and/or comparative genomic hybridization) in 241 neoplasms. Most ALT-WDLPS/DDLPS expressed MDM2 (97%) and CDK4 (92%) as opposed to few benign adipose tumors (MDM2, 5%; CDK4, 2%) and a limited number of non-ALT-WDLSP/DDLPS sarcomas (MDM2, 19%; CDK4, 6%). The sensitivity and specificity of MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings in identifying ALT-WDLPS/DDLPS among other soft tissue tumors were 97% and 92%, and 83% and 95%, respectively. MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings were particularly useful to separate ALT-WDLPS from the large group of differentiated adipose tumors, and to distinguish DDLPS from poorly differentiated sarcomas. A strong correlation was observed between MDM2 and CDK4 stainings and gene amplification status. In conclusion, MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings, which correlate with gene amplification, are helpful adjuncts to differentiate ALT-WDLPS from benign adipose tumors and to separate DDLPS from poorly differentiated sarcomas.","title":"MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings are useful adjuncts in diagnosing well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma subtypes: a comparative analysis of 559 soft tissue neoplasms with genetic data.","pubmedId":"16160477"}
