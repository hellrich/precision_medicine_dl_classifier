Our finding provides support for the hypothesis that oncogenes have a preferred telomeric territory that is evolutionarily conserved. Given our physical mapping of c-Ki-ras-2 to 6F-G, the role of this oncogene in the genesis and/or maintenance of granulocytic leukemias can now be explored by correlating the oncogenic site to that of the structural rearrangement of chromosome 6 seen in the tumors.","title":"In situ localization of murine c-Ki-ras-2 oncogene: preliminary evidence for conservation of telomeric territory of oncogenes?","pubmedId":"3279541"}
