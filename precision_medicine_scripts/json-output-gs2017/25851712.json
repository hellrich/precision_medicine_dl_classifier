{"genes":["DDIT3","FUS","MDM2"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"Malignant lipomatous tumors of the vulva are uncommon. We present 2 cases of liposarcoma arising in the vulva: a myxoid liposarcoma harboring DDIT3 and FUS rearrangements and a well differentiated liposarcoma/atypical lipomatous tumor harboring MDM2 amplification detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Both cases are the first liposarcomas of this site to be confirmed by molecular cytogenetic analysis. We also review the literature\u0027s cases of liposarcoma to further examine the clinicopathologic features of these tumors.
