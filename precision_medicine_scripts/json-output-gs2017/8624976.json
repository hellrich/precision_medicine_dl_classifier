Fasting patients had blood drawn for determination of serum insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II and GH by radioimmunoassay. Height, weight, and blood pressure were recorded. An electrocardiogram was obtained and echocardiography were performed for calculation of LV mass.\nPatients\u0027 average age was 54.7 +/-1.6 years, and duration of NIDDM was 9.3 +/- 1.2 years. LV mass was 113.7 +/- 8.9 g/m2 in men (n\u003d13) and 104.1 +/- 10.8 g/m2 in women (n\u003d10). Serum insulin was 25.3 +/- ng/mL, IGF-I was 255 +/- 15 ng/mL, IGF-II was 0.62 +/- 0.05 microg/mL and GH was 5.4 +/- 0.5 ng/mL. There were no significant differences in LV mass among patients with serum insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II or GH in the upper compared with the lower 50th percentile. There were no significant differences in serum insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II or GH among patients in the upper compared with the lower 50th percentile for LV mass. Standardization of LV mass for body size, either by height or body surface area, did not alter the relationships. The correlation coefficients from linear least squares regression analysis between these hormones and LV mass were low (r\u003c0.003), suggesting that even much larger sample sizes might not alter these findings.\nThese data suggest that circulating total serum concentrations of growth factor (insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II and GH) are not determinants of LV mass in nonhypertensive patients with NIDDM.","title":"Serum insulin, IGF-I,IGF-II and growth hormone, and left ventricular mass in noninsulin-dependent mellitus.","pubmedId":"8624976"}
