There have been many reports on the use of transcatheter intraarterial infusion (TAI) with anticancer drugs, but there are no randomized controlled trials in Japan. Our study of transcatheter arterial infusion before operation or radiotherapy for uterine cervical cancer was performed for 49 patients,and the number of patients with stage Ib (bulky tumor\u003e3 cm), II, III, or IVa disease were 15, 18, 11, and 5, respectively. The drugs infused were cisplatin (100 mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (300 mg/m(2)). The median survival time, 2-and 5-year survival rates were 62 months, 81.6%, and 70.6%, respectively. There were no grade 4 acute toxicities. As a late complication, ileus occurred in 8.2%. TAI may improve the prognosis of patients who underwent a radical operation after TAI.","title":"[Antitumor effects and clinical problems of transcatheter intraarterial infusion for uterine cervical cancer].","pubmedId":"16969017"}
