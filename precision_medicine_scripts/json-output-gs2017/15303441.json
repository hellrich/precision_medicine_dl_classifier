Recommendations for the treatment of unresectable non-small cell and small cell lung cancer are described here. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy combined with thoracic radiotherapy is recommended for the treatment for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer. New chemotherapy agents, including paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and irinotecan have been incorporated into combination regimens with carboplatin or cisplatin have become the standard therapy for advanced/metastatic NSCLC. Docetaxel is recommended as second-line therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on first-line therapy. Etopside and cisplatin concurrently combined with twice-daily thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) is the standard care of limited -disease small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated that irinotecan and cisplatin is superior to etoposide and cisplatin, a standard treatment of extensive-disease SCLC. This practice guideline should be updated periodically.","title":"[Evidence-based practice guideline for unresectable advanced lung cancer in 2003].","pubmedId":"15303441"}
