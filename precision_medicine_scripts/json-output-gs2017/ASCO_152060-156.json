MSK-IMPACT is an exon capture-based sequencing assay performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory that targets 341 cancer-associated genes, many of which are potential drug targets. We assessed mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) in primary and metastatic samples from untreated, hormone-treated and castration resistant pts.  Methods:  Pts with localized and metastatic PC were enrolled on an IRB-approved protocol for tumor genomic profiling. Fixed tumor and matched germline samples were subjected to DNA sequencing analysis using MSK-IMPACT for the identification of somatic mutations and CNAs.  Results:  135 tumor samples from 124 pts were successfully sequenced, including 83 primary and 52 metastatic tumors. Metastatic sites include LN (22), bone (12), liver (6), lung (2) and other soft tissue (10). 5 tumors were pathologically classified as neuroendocrine. Common alterations in the metastatic tumors include TP53 deletion/mutation (44%), AR amplification/mutation (38%), PTEN deletion/mutation (29%), RB1 deletion/mutation (17%), BRCA2 deletion/mutation (13%), FOXA1 mutation (12%) and SPOP mutation (8%). Common alterations in the primary tumors (67% with Gleason \u003e 7) include TP53 mutation (20%), SPOP mutation (11%) and PTEN deletion/mutation (10%). Among metastatic samples, tumors from pts with castration resistant disease have higher CNA burden when compared to tumors from untreated or castration-sensitive pts (0.30 vs. 0.19 fraction genome altered, p \u003c 0.05, unpaired t-test) as well as higher rates of AR amplification/mutation (50% vs. 7%, p \u003c 0.01, Fishers exact test).  Conclusions:  Genomic profiling of primary and metastatic prostate tumors is feasible with the targeted MSK-IMPACT assay and recapitulates findings from broader whole exome-based studies. This will facilitate genomic biomarker development and the rational selection of single-agent or combination therapy trials for pts with high-risk and metastatic disease.","title":"Genomic characterization of primary and metastatic prostate cancer (PC) using a targeted next-generation sequencing assay.","pubmedId":"ASCO_152060-156"}
