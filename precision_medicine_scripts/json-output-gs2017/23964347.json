This study evaluated whether common variants of BRCA1/BRCA2 are associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced stage sporadic EOC.\nThe allelic frequency of BRCA1 (2612C \u003e T, P871L-rs799917) and BRCA2 (114A \u003e C, N372H-rs144848) were determined in normal blood DNA from women in Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol #172 phase III trial with optimally resected stage III EOC treated with intraperitoneal or intravenous cisplatin and paclitaxel (C + P). Associations between polymorphisms and PFS or OS were assessed.\nTwo hundred and thirty-two women were included for analyses. African Americans (AA) had different distributions for the two polymorphisms from Caucasians and others. For non-AA patients, the genotype for BRCA1 P871L was distributed as 38% for CC, 49% for CT, and 13% for TT. Median PFS was estimated to be 31, 21, and 21 months, respectively. After adjusting for cell type, residual disease, and chemotherapy regimen, CT/TT genotypes were associated with a 1.40-fold increased risk of disease progression [95% confidence interval (CI) \u003d 1.00-1.95, p \u003d 0.049]. After removing seven patients with known BRCA1 germline mutations, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.36 (95% CI \u003d 0.97-1.91, p \u003d 0.073). The association between BRCA1 P871L and OS was not significant (HR \u003d 1.25, 95% CI \u003d 0.88-1.76, p \u003d 0.212). Genotype distribution of BRCA2 N372H among non-AA patients was 50, 44, and 6% for AA, AC, and CC, respectively and there is no evidence that this BRCA2 polymorphism was related to PFS or OS.\nPolymorphisms in BRCA1 P871L or in BRCA2 N372H were not associated with either PFS or OS in women with optimally resected, stage III EOC treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel.","title":"Assessment of the Prognostic Value of Two Common Variants of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genes in Ovarian Cancer Patients Treated with Cisplatin and Paclitaxel: A Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.","pubmedId":"23964347"}
