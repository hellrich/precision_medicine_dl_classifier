The preoperative work-up showed no signs of liver metastasis and confirmed the patient\u0027s operability, but at less than 40 days postoperatively there were diffuse liver metastasis present on CT. This rapid evolution raises the question whether current staging systems are adequate in determining a patient\u0027s operability. It also suggests an interaction between the primary tumor and the host and the existence of disseminated tumor cells.\nIn this article, we give an explanation for the clinical evolution presented in our case using the \"integrated organ\" and the \"concomitant resistance\" hypotheses. We believe that, if these theories continue to prove their viability, the search for disseminated tumor cells will be essential for good clinical practice in this type of pathology.","title":"Postsurgery activation of dormant liver micrometastasis: a case report and review of literature.","pubmedId":"20602181"}
