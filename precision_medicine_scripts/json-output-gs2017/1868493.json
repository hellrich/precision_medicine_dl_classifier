Under the conditions applied, IL-2 was non-toxic. In the mammary carcinoma IL-2 was therapeutically inactive. In the colorectal carcinoma, 1200 U IL-2/day exhibited significant antitumour activity in established tumours as well as in tumours treated \"prophylactically\" before their manifestation (P less than 0.05). The effect of IL-2 seemed to be more pronounced when given before manifestation of colorectal tumours (T/C \u003d 8.7% vs 17.8% in established tumours). The differential sensitivity of the autochthonous mammary and colorectal carcinoma may be explained by differences in their proliferation rates and differences in volumes at the beginning of IL-2 therapy. IL-2 seems to be preferentially active in small tumours with a low proliferation rate, a feature typical of colon tumours.","title":"Treatment of chemically induced autochthonous rat mammary and colorectal carcinomas with interleukin-2.","pubmedId":"1868493"}
