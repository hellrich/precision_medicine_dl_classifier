PTEN deletion was significantly linked to advanced tumor stage (p\u003d0.0054), high-grade (p\u003c0.0001), high tumor cell proliferation (Ki67 Labeling Index; p\u003c0.0001), and shortened overall survival (p\u003d0.0090). PTEN deletions were inversely associated with features of luminal type breast cancers (ER/PR positivity; p\u003c0.0001 each, and CCND1 amplification; p\u003d0.0020). PTEN deletions were also strongly linked to amplification of genes involved in the PTEN/AKT pathway such as MYC (p\u003d0.0430) and HER2 (p\u003d0.0065). Remarkably the combined analysis of MYC, HER2, CCND1 and PTEN aberrations suggested that aberrations of multiple PTEN/AKT pathway genes have a strong additive effect on breast cancer prognosis. While cancers with one of these aberrations behaved only marginally different from cancers with none, disease outcome was markedly worse in cancers with two or more aberrations as compared to those with only one aberration (p\u003d0.0002). In addition, the particularly poor prognosis of patients with HER2 amplification and PTEN deletions challenges the concept of PTEN deletions interfering with trastuzumab therapy.\nPTEN deletion occurs in a relevant fraction of breast cancers, and is linked to aggressive tumor behavior. Reduced PTEN function cooperates with MYC and HER2 activation in conferring aggressive phenotype to cancer cells.","title":"Partial PTEN deletion is linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"26672755"}
