All subjects underwent genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were excluded. This cohort of 5 842 patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast cancer was classified as two groups: familial breast cancer patients (n\u003d480) and sporadic breast cancer patients (n\u003d5 362). The clinicalpathological data and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of the 480 patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer and the 5 362 patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative sporadic breast cancer were compared retrospectively. Then the influencing factors of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed.\nAmong the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast cancer patients, 4.4% of the patients were diagnosed before 30 years of age in the familial breast cancer group, significantly higher than that of 2.6% in the sporadic breast cancer group(P\u003d0.020). 5.0% of the patients in the familial breast cancer group had bilateral breast cancer, significantly higher than that of 2.7% in the sporadic breast cancer group (P\u003d0.004). Compared with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative sporadic breast cancer patients, the relative risk of early-onset breast cancer (≤ 30 years) and bilateral breast cancer were 1.73 and 1.91, respectively, significantly higher than that in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer cases (P\u003d0.020 and P\u003d0.004). 2 964 patients in this cohort of 5 842 case sreceived neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was significantly higher in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer group than in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative sporadic breast cancer group (21.7% vs. 14.0%, P\u003d0.001). Independent factors associated with pCR in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast cancer patients were tumor size less than 2 cm (P\u003d0.012), histologic grade Ⅲ (P\u003c0.001), triple-negative breast cancers (P\u003c0.001), and BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer(P\u003d0.001).\nCompared with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative sporadic breast cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer is more likely diagnosed before the age of 30 years and has a higher risk to develop bilateral breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancers are more likely to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative sporadic breast cancer.","title":"[Relationship of clinicopathological features and chemotherapeutic outcomes in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer].","pubmedId":"26988823"}
