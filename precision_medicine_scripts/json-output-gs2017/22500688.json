Met is overexpressed in non-small-cell lung cancer and its lack of staining in normal lung tissue makes it an attractive target. To date, erlotinib and gefitinib have established themselves as first-line therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer patients whose tumors harbor an EGF receptor gene mutation, and hence, it is crucial that we identify mechanisms of resistance that could be targeted by novel agents, while keeping an acceptable toxicity profile at the same time; something very important when we develop these new drugs. Inhibitors of the Met pathway represent a therapeutic alternative in this setting. In this review, we discuss the early clinical studies reported using two Met inhibitors, a monoclonal antibody (MetMAb) and a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (MGCD265).","title":"Targeting the Met pathway in lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22500688"}
