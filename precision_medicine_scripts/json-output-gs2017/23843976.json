Wufeng is a region of high cervical cancer incidence in China. This study aimed to investigate the issues that concern cervical cancer and screening and the factors that affect women\u0027s willingness to undergo cervical cancer screening in the Wufeng area.\nA cross-sectional survey of women was conducted to determine their knowledge about cervical cancer and screening, demographic characteristics and the barriers to screening.\nWomen who were willing to undergo screenings had higher knowledge levels. \"Anxious feeling once the disease was diagnosed\" (47.6%), \"No symptoms/discomfort\" (34.1%) and \"Do not know the benefits of cervical cancer screening\" (13.4%) were the top three reasons for refusing cervical cancer screening. Women who were younger than 45 years old or who had lower incomes, positive family histories of cancer, secondary or higher levels of education, higher levels of knowledge and fewer barriers to screening were more willing to participate in cervical cancer screenings than women without these characteristics.\nEfforts are needed to increase women\u0027s knowledge about cervical cancer, especially the screening methods, and to improve their perceptions of the screening process for early detection to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates.","title":"Knowledge about cervical cancer and barriers of screening program among women in Wufeng County, a high-incidence region of cervical cancer in China.","pubmedId":"23843976"}
