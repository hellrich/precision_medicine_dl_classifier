Patients are at an increased cancer risk not only for gastrointestinal but also for extraintestinal neoplasms.\nWe report on the clinical and molecular findings in 3 young female patients with PJS; 2 of them suffered from severe gynecological cancer. One patient died at the age of 29 years of an incurable mucin-producing cervical adenocarcinoma. Another patient had a papillary serous carcinoma of the ovary. In all patients, we identified corresponding mutations in the STK11 gene, 2 of them novel.\nPJS should be considered in differential diagnosis in young women with gynecological malignancies. Identification of STK11 mutations in patients and their relatives can help to improve the clinical management.","title":"Different phenotypes including gynecological cancer in three female patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and mutations in the STK11 gene.","pubmedId":"19145097"}
