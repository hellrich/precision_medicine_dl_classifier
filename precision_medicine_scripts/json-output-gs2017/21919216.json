Furthermore, breast involvement by non-Hodgkins lymphoma is a rare event and primary breast non-Hodgkins lymphoma is even rarer. The authors take this opportunity to report a case of primary B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma breast occurring in association with invasive ductal carcinoma in a 47-year-old female for its rare synchronous association.","title":"Coexistent non-Hodgkins lymphoma and ductal carcinoma breast: diagnosis on fine needle aspiration cytology.","pubmedId":"21919216"}
