Studies screening melanoma case series for different types of mutations are relatively rare.\nThe authors analyzed the frequency of various somatic point mutations of 10 genes in 106 primary cutaneous melanoma cases. The mutations (BRAF, NRAS, KIT, CDKN2A, KRAS, HRAS, PIK3CA, STK11, GNAQ, CTNNB1) were evaluated with real-time PCR-based PCR-Array through allele-specific amplification, and the results were correlated with various clinicopathological characteristics.\nMutations were found in 64.2% of the melanomas overall. BRAF (42.5%), NRAS (15.1%), and CDKN2A (13.2%) were the 3 most common mutations. BRAF and NRAS mutations were more frequent in nodular and superficial spreading melanomas (P \u003c 0.001). Associations with BRAF mutation were as follows: male gender [odds ratio (OR) \u003d 2.4], younger age (OR \u003d 2.7), superficial spreading (OR \u003d 15.6) and nodular melanoma (OR \u003d 9.5), trunk localization (OR \u003d 6.3), and intermittent sun exposure (OR \u003d 4.6). A considerable percentage of V600K (44.4%) mutations were found among the BRAF mutations, whereas KIT mutations (3.8%) were less frequent. Multiple mutations were detected in 13.2% of the melanomas. The most common co-occurrences were in the BRAF, NRAS, and CDKN2A genes.\nThe authors analyzed 10 somatic mutations in the main subtypes of primary cutaneous melanomas from the western region of Turkey. Mutations were found in 64.2% of the melanomas overall. The most common mutations were in the BRAF and NRAS genes. In addition to other less common mutations, a notable number of multiple mutations were encountered. The multiplicity and concurrence of mutations in this study may provide further study areas for personalized targeted therapy.","title":"Clinicopathological characteristics and mutation profiling in primary cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"25357015"}
