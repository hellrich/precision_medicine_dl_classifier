It has been reported that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is an essential factor involved in the epigenetic mechanisms of drug resistance, which provides a novel potential target for improving the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we first demonstrate that a novel bFGF antagonist, peptide P7, previously isolated by phage display technology, reversed bFGF-induced resistance to irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11), and counteracted the anti-apoptotic effects of bFGF on CPT-11-treated HT-29 cells. Further experiments indicated that the inhibition of Akt activation, the suppression of bFGF internalization, the increase in the Bax to Bcl-2 ratio and the downregulation of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) by P7 may contribute to the counteracting of the anti-apoptotic effects of bFGF, and further reversal of bFGF-induced resistance to CPT-11. Our results suggest that peptide P7 may have therapeutic potential in CRC as a sensitizer to chemotherapeutic agents by targeting bFGF.","title":"P7 peptides targeting bFGF sensitize colorectal cancer cells to CPT-11.","pubmedId":"24190390"}
