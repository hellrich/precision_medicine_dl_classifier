Conditional expression of an activated Kras allele in the mouse pancreas produces a model that faithfully recapitulates PanIN formation and progression to PDAC. Importantly, although nearly every cell in the pancreata of these mice express activated Kras, only a very small minority of cells give rise to PanINs. How the transforming activity of Kras is constrained in the pancreas remains unknown, and the cell types from which PanINs and PDAC arise are similarly unknown. Here, we describe our recent results demonstrating that acinar cells are competent to form Kras-induced PanINs, and that active Notch signaling can synergize with Kras in PanIN initiation and progression. Further efforts to understand how Notch and Kras synergize, as well as experiments to determine how other pancreatic cell types contribute to PDAC development, should aid in the development of new therapies and early detection techniques that are desperately needed for this cancer.","title":"Notch and Kras in pancreatic cancer: at the crossroads of mutation, differentiation and signaling.","pubmedId":"19440048"}
