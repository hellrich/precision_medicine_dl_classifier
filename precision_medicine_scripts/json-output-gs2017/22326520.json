Mutations in cdh23 are associated with age-related hearing loss (AHL). In this study, we proposed that the Cdh23(nmf308/nmf308) mice with progressive hair cell loss had specific morphological changes and suffered a base to apex gradient and age-related hearing loss, and that mutations in cdh23 were linked to AHL. The Cdh23(nmf308/nmf308) mice produced by the N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis program were used as an animal model to study AHL and progressive hair cell loss. RT-PCR was performed to confirm the cdh23 mutation in Cdh23(nmf308/nmf308) mice and genetic analysis was used to map the specific mutation site. Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) assay and acoustic brainstem evoked response (ABR) threshold analysis were carried out to evaluate the AHL. Cochlear histology was examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), as well as the nuclear labeling by propidium iodide staining; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and caspase-3 activities were examined to evaluate cell apoptosis. Genetic mapping identified the candidate gene linking AHL in Cdh23(nmf308/nmf308) mice as cdh23. A mutation in exon3 (63 T\u003eC) was screened as compared with the sequence of the same position of the gene from B6 (+/+) mice. The cochleae outer hair cells were reduced from 5-10% at one month to 100% at three months in the basal region. DPOAE and ABR exhibited an increasing threshold at high frequencies (â‰¥16kHz) from one month of age. Morphological and cellular analysis showed that Cdh23(nmf308/nmf308) mice exhibited a time course of histological alterations and cell apoptosis of outer hair cells. Our results suggest that the cdh23 mutation may be harmful to the stereociliary tip link and cause the hair cell apoptosis. Due to the same cdh23 mutations in human subjects with presbycusis (Petit et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2005), the Cdh23(nmf308/nmf308) mouse is an excellent animal model for investigating the mechanisms involved in human AHL.","title":"A mutation in the cdh23 gene causes age-related hearing loss in Cdh23(nmf308/nmf308) mice.","pubmedId":"22326520"}
