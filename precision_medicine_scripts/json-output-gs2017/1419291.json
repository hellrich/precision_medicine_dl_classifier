Treatment was generally well tolerated. The most common side-effect was myelosuppression, with 1 toxic death due to leukopenia-related sepsis. 1 patient developed severe congestive heart failure 12 months from the end of therapy. 36 patients were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 55%. Median duration of response was 8 months and median survival time was 16 months. This regimen warrants further investigations.","title":"A phase II study of 5-fluorouracil and high-dose folinic acid in combination with cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone for advanced breast cancer.","pubmedId":"1419291"}
