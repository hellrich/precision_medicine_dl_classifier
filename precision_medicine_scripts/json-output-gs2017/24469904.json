Of them, lincRNA1611 and Ppp3ca were validated significantly high expression in DT-PCa cells and in 22 of 26 fresh resected human PDAC tissues, compared to SH-PAN cells and normal pancreatic tissues, respectively. Moreover, Tp53 mutation status displayed a positive correlation with lincRNA1611 or Ppp3ca level. Immunohistochemical staining for Ppp3ca was weak or lack in 91 of 107 normal pancreatic tissues, 24 of 29 PanIN-I and 13 of 16 PanIN-II tissues, however, was strong in 10 of 27 PanIN-III and 62 of 107 PDAC tissues post operation.\nLincRNA1611 and Ppp3ca were high expression in PDAC and may serve as new potential targets for intervention of the disease.","title":"Exploring the Wnt pathway-associated LncRNAs and genes involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis driven by Tp53 mutation.","pubmedId":"24469904"}
