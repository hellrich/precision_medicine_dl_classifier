Its role in metastatic or locally advanced non small cell lung cancer treatment is undeniable. In pretreated patients with metastatic NSCLC, two recent phase III trials have shown an improvement of survival and quality of life for patients receiving docetaxel. In front line treatment, docetaxel administered alone every three weeks or in combination with a platine compound has became a gold standard treatment. Activity of the associations cisplatinium/docetaxel and carboplatin/docetaxel is similar to those reported with previous combinations containing a platine derivative. The weekly schedule of docetaxel and its combination with other well known active drugs in NSCLC such as gemcitabin or vinorelbin deserve further evaluations. Therapeutic options with docetaxel in adjuvant situation in resected NSCLC or in combination with radiation therapy in operable locally advanced NSCLC should be developed in the next future.","title":"[Docetaxel and non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"15171051"}
