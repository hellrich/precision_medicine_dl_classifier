Patients with KRAS-mutant lung cancers have a heterogeneous clinical course. The pattern of co-occuring mutations in other oncogenes and tumor suppressors has been hypothesized to describe different biological subsets of patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. We used results of routine, clinical next-generation sequencing to comprehensively describe concurrent genetic alterations present in KRAS-mutant lung cancers and explore the effect of such alterations on patient outcomes. Methods: We identified patients with KRAS mutant lung cancers who underwent routine hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing clinical assay, sequencing \u003e 340 cancer-related genes, between January 2014 and September 2015. Fishers exact test was used for association of frequencies and the association of concurrent mutations and overall survival was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard model. Results: Among 239 patients (women 153, men 86) with KRAS-mutant lung cancers, the predominant histology was adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 221, 92%). KRAS mutation subtypes: G12C \u003d 106, G12D \u003d 37, G12V \u003d 37, G12A \u003d 19, G13D \u003d 11, other \u003d 29). 333 different genes were found mutated along with KRAS, median of 7 co-occuring mutations (range 0  55) per tumor. The most frequent mutations were found in TP53 (39%), STK11 (30%), KEAP1 (24%), RBM10 (15%), and PTPRD (15%). There was shorter overall survival (OS) in patients with concurrent mutations in STK11 (HR 2, 95%CI 1.2-3.4, p \u003d 0.006) or KEAP1 (HR 2.8, 95%CI 1.7-4.7, p \u003c 0.001). Neither TP53 status (HR 1.25, p \u003d 0.4) nor number of concurrent mutations ( \u003c 7 vs \u003e 7, HR 1.5, p \u003d 0.124) were associated with significant differences in overall survival. Conclusions: This is the largest series of KRAS-mutant lung cancers with a broad analysis of co-occuring molecular alterations and outcomes. Concurrent mutations in either STK11 or KEAP1 are associated with shorter survival, suggesting that information available from routine, clinical next-generation sequencing describes clinically relevant subtypes of KRAS-mutant lung cancer.","title":"Association of outcomes and co-occuring genomic alterations in patients with KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_169166-176"}
