One hundred and twenty-six hypertensive patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomized into amlodipine group (10 mg/day, group A, n \u003d 65) and amlodipine (10 mg/day) plus atorvastatin group (20 mg/day, group B, n \u003d 61), treated for 4 months continuously. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, hs-CRP, and UA were determined, and blood pressure of both groups was examined before and after treatment. Left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular spectum thickness were measured by echocardiography, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was calculated. After 4-months of treatment with atorvastatin, serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, hs-CRP, and UA were significantly decreased in group B (P \u003c 0.05, P \u003c 0.01), while serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was elevated (P \u003c 0.05). Meanwhile, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were reduced in both groups (P \u003c 0.05), and blood pressure in group B was markedly lower than that in group A after treatment (P \u003c 0.05). Compared with that before treatment, LVMI in both groups decreased (P \u003c 0.05), to a significantly lower degree in group B than in group A (P \u003c 0.05). Atorvastatin can decrease serum concentrations of hs-CRP and UA. The amlodipine-atorvastatin combination markedly reduces blood pressure and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy more than amlodipine monotherapy. The positive effect suggests that in hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic patients, the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin could be the treatment of choice.","title":"Synergistic effect of amlodipine and atorvastatin on blood pressure, left ventricular remodeling, and C-reactive protein in hypertensive patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.","pubmedId":"18389332"}
