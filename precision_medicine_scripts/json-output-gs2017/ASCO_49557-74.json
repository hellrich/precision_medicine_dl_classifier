Each drug has different modes of action on the HER2/EGFR signal cascade; the mechanism of HER3 block is unclear. We measure therapy effects by phosphoprotein/post-translationally modified protein signaling and gene expression analysis. Molecular profiling allows individualizing therapy separately or together. Changes in compensatory or inter- connected proteins may reveal off-target effects or new combination therapies. This phase II study (USON 05-074/GSK LPT 109096) is the first to monitor signal pathway targets before and after mono or dual therapy. Insights for individualized therapy may be derived by correlating good and poor patient outcomes at the molecular level (gene expression, stem cell data, proteomic signaling pathways) with clinical response at trial completion. The goals are to: 1) identify kinase signal pathway activation states in cancer cells, prior to therapy (biopsy one), or during therapy (biopsy two), which predict later clinical response after standard of care chemotherapy/surgery; 2) identify kinase pathway interconnections in cancer cells that are altered by therapy; 3) evaluate the effect on stem cell populations; and 4) changes in gene expression patterns. Methods: Eligibility are: informed consent; HER2+, Stage II or III invasive breast cancer; adequate cardiac function. Core needle biopsies are collected in a fixative that blocks phosphatase/kinase fluctuations, frozen, subjected to frozen section laser capture microdissection. Using reverse phase protein microarrays in less than 2000 cells, and blinded to outcome, we measured: CD24, CD44, EGFR Y992, EGFR Y1068, EGFR Y1148, EGFR Y1173, EGFR, HER2 Y1248, HER3Tyr1289, AKT Ser473, AKT Thr308, AKT, Actin, ERK Thr202/Y204, GSK3 S21/9, GSK3 Y279/216, IGF-1R Y1131/1146, MEK 1/2 Ser217/221, mTOR Ser2448, p70S6 Thr389, PI3K, PTEN, and Ser380. At trial end (99 pts) (n\u003d86 to date), the activation state of signal pathways and their interconnections will be compared before and after therapy with the clinical response and correlated with stem cell and transcript microarray data.","title":"Lapatinib and trastuzumab: Molecular effects and efficacy, separately and combined in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_49557-74"}
