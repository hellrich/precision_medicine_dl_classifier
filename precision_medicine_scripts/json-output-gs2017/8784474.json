The prognosis was significantly worse in the HGF-positive or c-Met-positive patients than in the negative patients. Multivariate analysis showed that c-Met had a significant effect on the prognosis, whereas HGF did not. Our findings suggest that HGF and c-Met play an important role in tumor progression and that c-Met can be a useful prognostic marker for pulmonary adenocarcinomas.","title":"Hepatocyte growth factor and c-Met/hepatocyte growth factor receptor in pulmonary adenocarcinomas: an evaluation of their expression as prognostic markers.","pubmedId":"8784474"}
