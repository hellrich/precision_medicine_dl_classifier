We evaluated the effect of PDT on mice colon carcinoma and melanoma using systemic 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA).\nCT26 colon carcinoma and B16 melanoma cells were incubated with ALA for 48 h. Subsequently, cells were subjected to photoradiation at 40, 60 and 100 J/cm2 and viability was assessed. In vivo studies: Balb/C mice were injected subcutaneously with 2x10(5) CT26 colon cancer cells and C57/Bl mice were injected subcutaneously with 2x10(5) melanoma cells. ALA 60 mg/kg was injected intra-peritoneally when tumors were visible. After 24 h mice were subjected to photoradiation (100 J/cm2).\nThere was a significant decrease in the viability of treated cells as compared with non-treated tumor cells and with treated splenocytes (p\u003c0.001). In vivo studies: PDT induced necrosis of both tumors. PDT also significantly prolonged the survival of the treated mice (p\u003c0.05).\nPhotodynamic therapy using systemic ALA as a photosensitizer was effective in treating mice colon cancer and melanoma in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Further pre-clinical and clinical studies are being conducted now.","title":"Photodynamic therapy of murine colon cancer and melanoma using systemic aminolevulinic acid as a photosensitizer.","pubmedId":"12678516"}
