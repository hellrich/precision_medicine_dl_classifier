For example, the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway genes are already known to alter the cell metabolism and to play a critical role in the malignant behavior of cancer. Accordingly, based on the assumption that genetic variations in the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway can change the intracellular signal in terms of metabolic reprogramming, the present study analyzed 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the STK11, PRKAA1, TSC1/2, and mTOR genes and their impact on the survival of patients with colorectal cancer.  Methods:  772 consecutive patients with surgically resected colorectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled in the present study. 18 SNPs were selected from an in Silico analysis based on previous evidence of association. The SNP genotyping was performed using a Sequenom MassARRAY.  Results:  With a median age of 64 years, 433 (56.1%) patients were diagnosed with colon cancer and 333 (43.1%) with rectal cancer. The pathologic stages after surgical resection were as follows: stage I (n\u003d139, 18.0%), stage II (n\u003d318, 41.2%), and stage III (n\u003d315, 40.8%). Among the 18 polymorphisms, three SNPs (PRKAA1 rs461404, STK11 rs741765, and TSC1 rs13295634) were significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, a multivariate analysis showed that the TT genotype of PRKAA1 rs461404, GG genotype of STK11, and TG or GG genotype of TSC1 were identified as independent prognostic factors for a worse DFS (HR\u003d1.408, 1.398, and 1.388; P\u003d0.013, 0.030, and 0.002, respectively) and overall survival (OS) (HR\u003d1.680, 1.431, and 1.394; P\u003d0.001, 0.038, and 0.009, respectively).  Conclusions:  The present results suggest that genetic variants of the PRKAA1, STK11, and TSC1 genes could be used as prognostic biomarkers for Korean patients with surgically resected colorectal cancer.","title":"Genetic variations in STK11, PRKAA1, and TSC1 associated with prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_131179-144"}
