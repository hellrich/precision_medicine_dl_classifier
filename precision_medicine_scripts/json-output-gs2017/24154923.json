This treatment was suspended because of its side effects and because radiological examinations showed that the tumor had not changed or had even increased slightly in size. Thus, we performed esophagectomy via left thoracotomy and removed a tumor that measured 18 × 17 × 10 cm. Immunohistochemical examination revealed positive reactions for c-kit and CD34, suggestive of a high-risk malignancy. The patient was discharged from hospital on postoperative day 30, and has remained well with no sign of tumor recurrence for more than 5 years, without adjuvant chemotherapy.","title":"Long-term survival after excision of a giant esophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumor with imatinib mesylate resistance: report of a case.","pubmedId":"24154923"}
