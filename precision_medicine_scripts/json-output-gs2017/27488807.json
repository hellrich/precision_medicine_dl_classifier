Recently, a BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody, VE1, was generated for the detection of tumors bearing BRAF V600E mutations. To determine the clinical value of immunohistochemical testing, we compared the prevalence of mutant BRAF detected by VE1 with direct sequencing results.\nParaffin-embedded, formalin-fixed melanoma biopsies were analyzed for the BRAF mutation status by immunohistochemistry with the VE1 antibody. Sanger sequencing was applied to verify the immunohistochemical results.\nA total of 73 melanoma cases with tumor samples from primary lymph nodes and metastatic sites were selected for this study. Direct sequencing demonstrated that 18 of 73 cases (24.6%) harbored the BRAF V600 mutation: 17 with V600E and one with V600K. All 18 tumors shown to harbor the BRAF V600E/K mutations were VE1-positive. One additional case was false-positive for VE1. The sensitivity and specificity of VE1 was 100% (18/18) and 98% (54/55), respectively. The overall concordance between the immunohistochemical method and direct sequencing was excellent (98.6%).\nOur findings demonstrate that immunohistochemical analysis using VE1 constitutes a highly sensitive test for the detection of BRAF mutations and suggest that this cost-effective method is suitable as a rapid diagnostic approach complementary to molecular testing.","title":"A comparison of immunohistochemical and molecular methods used for analyzing the BRAF V600E gene mutation in malignant melanoma in Taiwan.","pubmedId":"27488807"}
