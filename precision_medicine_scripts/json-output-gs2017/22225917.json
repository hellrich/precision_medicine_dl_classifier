Our previous study revealed that 8,9-side-chains of 6,6-dimethyl-11-oxo-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo[b]carbazole scaffold crucially affected kinase selectivity, cellular activity, and metabolic stability. In this work, we optimized the side-chains and identified highly selective, orally active and potent ALK inhibitor CH5424802 (18a) as the clinical candidate.","title":"Design and synthesis of a highly selective, orally active and potent anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor (CH5424802).","pubmedId":"22225917"}
