We aimed to assess the cost and health outcomes of afatinib and gefitinib in this setting. Methods: A partitioned survival model was designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of afatinib versus geftinib in the French context for EGFRm+ NSCLC.Outcomes and safety are taken primarily from the head-to-head LL7 trial. Only direct medical costs were considered. Resources use and utilities were derived from the trial, expert panel and published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated in the common EGFR population and also, in the sub-groups with EGFR Exon 19 deletion (del 19) and EGFR Exon 21 L858R (L858R) mutation over a 10 year-time horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: For common EGFR+ NSCLC, the ICER of afatinib versus gefitinib was 45,211 per QALY (with a gain of 0.170 QALYs, and an incremental cost of 7,697). The ICERs for del 19 and L858R populations were 38,970 and 52,518 respectively. Afatinib had a probability of 100% to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 70,000 for patients with common EGFR mutation, and also in the del 19 and L858R subgroups. Conclusions: Afatinib is a cost-effective treatment compared to geftinib in patients with EGFRm+ NSCLC with an ICER varying between 38,970/QALYs and 52,518/QALYs.","title":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of afatinib vs gefitinib in EGFR-mutated population with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_181205-199"}
