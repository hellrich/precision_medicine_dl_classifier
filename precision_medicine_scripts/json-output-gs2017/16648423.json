Until recently, the greatest strides in reducing cervical cancer mortality have occurred with the advent and implementation of screening programs. Many important advances have also taken place in the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer. This review article will highlight diagnostic and staging considerations with an emphasis on newer imaging modalities and how they might augment approved FIGO clinical staging. Management alternatives for patients with early-stage disease, locally advanced (stage IIB-IVA) disease, and metastatic cervical cancer will be discussed. Whenever possible, these discussions will unfold through an overview of pertinent clinical trials and current controversies.","title":"Cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"16648423"}
