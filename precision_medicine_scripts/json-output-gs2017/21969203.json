Common sites of metastases include the liver, lung, bone, and brain, while metastases to the extrahepatic digestive system are very rare. This report presents a patient diagnosed with breast carcinoma metastasis in the terminal ileum. The patient underwent breast-conserving surgery on both breasts because of breast cancer at the age of 46 years. Both breast cancers were consistent with stage I invasive ductal carcinomas. Colonoscopy during an investigation for hematochezia revealed a 2-cm ulceration in the terminal ileum 22 months later, and microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen of the ulceration revealed a poorly differentiated mass that was strongly suggestive of metastatic adenocarcinoma with endolymphatic tumor emboli. She underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic ileocecectomy because of ileal metastasis. She had a family history of breast cancer (sister) and colon cancer (brother). She exhibited HER2/neu discordance and carried the BRCA2 gene mutation. Surgeons should remain aware that breast cancer can metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract.","title":"Ileal metastasis of breast cancer in a patient with a BRCA2 gene mutation: report of a case.","pubmedId":"21969203"}
