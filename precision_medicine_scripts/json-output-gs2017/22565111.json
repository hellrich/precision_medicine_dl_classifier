The purpose of this study was to determine the intrauterine expression of the chief prostaglandin-inactivating enzyme, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH), during gestation and labor in the guinea pig, an animal model in which the endocrine control of pregnancy and parturition is analogous to that of women. PGDH messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance decreased significantly in the visceral yolk sac membrane (VYS, the anatomical equivalent of the human chorion laeve) and the amnion throughout the last third of pregnancy. PGDH protein was robustly expressed in the VYS epithelium and mesoderm, correlated strongly with PGDH mRNA levels and exhibited a nadir at term prior to labor onset. PGDH protein was not detected in the amnion. PGDH mRNA and protein levels in the placenta and myoendometrium were variable throughout late gestation. In the placenta, PGDH protein was concentrated in the parietal yolk sac membrane (PYS) lining the placental surface and in placental blood vessels. We observed strong expression of PGDH protein in the endometrial epithelium with comparably little expression in the myometrium. These data indicate that metabolic inactivation of prostaglandins in the pregnant guinea pig uterus takes place in the VYS, PYS, and endometrium. Decreased PGDH expression in the fetal membranes may contribute to the increase in intrauterine prostaglandin concentrations at term, stimulating the onset of labor.","title":"15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase expression and localization in guinea pig gestational tissues during late pregnancy and parturition.","pubmedId":"22565111"}
