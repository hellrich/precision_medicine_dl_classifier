Radiographic restaging was performed 4 to 6 weeks after chemoradiation, and patients with localized disease underwent pancreatectomy with EB-IORT.\nThirty-five patients completed chemoradiation; 16 (46%) experienced grade 3 toxicity. Four patients (11%) required hospitalization for dehydration due to grade 3 nausea and vomiting. Twenty (80%) of 25 patients who underwent surgery underwent pancreatectomy; EB-IORT was used in 13 patients. There were no histologic complete responses to preoperative therapy; 21% of specimens demonstrated more than 50% nonviable cells (grade 2b treatment effect). With a median follow-up period of 46 months, the 3-year overall survival rate with chemoradiation and pancreatectomy was 28%.\nPreoperative paclitaxel-based concurrent chemoradiation is feasible. The toxicity of this regimen seems greater than that with fluorouracil. The histologic responses and survival are similar, suggesting no advantages to paclitaxel-based preoperative treatment.","title":"Preoperative paclitaxel and concurrent rapid-fractionation radiation for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma: toxicities, histologic response rates, and event-free outcome.","pubmedId":"12011133"}
