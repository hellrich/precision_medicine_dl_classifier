Rationale drug combinations may improve outcomes in this setting. We assessed the therapeutic combination of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) targeting the Endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) with small molecule inhibitors of the MAP kinase signaling pathway in melanoma. Cell lines and tumor models containing either mutant BRAF or NRAS, or wildtype for both, were exposed to small molecule inhibitors or BRAF and MEK. Expression of EDNRB was analyzed and the therapeutic impact of combining the anti-EDNRB ADC with the BRAF and MEK inhibitors was assessed. Increased expression of EDNRB in response to inhibition of BRAF and/or MEK was observed and augmented the antitumor activity of the ADC. Enhanced target expression and ADC anti-tumor activity were realized irrespective of the response of the tumor model to the BRAF or MEK inhibitors alone and could be achieved in melanoma with mutant NRAS, BRAF or neither mutation. Cells that acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition through long-term culture retained drug-induced elevated levels of EDNRB expression. Expression of EDNRB was not enhanced in normal human melanocytes by inhibition of BRAF and the combination of the ADC with MAPK inhibitors was well tolerated in mice. The anti-EDNRB ADC combines well with BRAF and MEK inhibitors and could have therapeutic utility in the majority of human melanoma cases.","title":"MAPK pathway inhibition enhances the efficacy of an anti-endothelin B receptor drug conjugate by inducing target expression in melanoma","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2924"}
