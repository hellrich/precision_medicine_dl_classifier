We report the case of a patient who was diagnosed with a huge and atypical GIST in the stomach. The GIST was completely resected and finally diagnosed as c-kit-negative GIST based on immunohistochemical staining of tumor cells, which were negative for CD117 and CD34 and positive for Discovered on GIST-1 (DOG1). C-kit-negative GISTs could be treated by complete resection and/or imatinib, which is the same treatment for c-kit-positive GISTs.
