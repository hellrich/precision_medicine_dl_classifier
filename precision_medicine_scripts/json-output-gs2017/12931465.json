After the term of decrease of popularity of this operation, nowadays we can observe gradual come back to the idea of radical vaginal hysterectomy. Possibility of association of advanced laparoscopic techniques/lymphadenectomy/with vaginal operation have changed the approach to the surgical treatment of cervical cancer. The aim of the study is to present the method of laparoscopic-vaginal radical hysterectomy based on Schauta-Amreich technique. The 51 year old women was admitted to the hospital and cervical cancer FIGO stage IIA was diagnosed according to clinical and histopathological examination. We performed laparoscopic-vaginal radical hysterectomy in general anaesthesia. First after cutting of ligamentum teres uteri and infundibulo-pelvicum, laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was done. Subsequently vaginal stage of operation was performed. Then we did laparoscopy and controlled operation field again. Combining Schauta operation with laparoscopy allows us to estimate lymph nodes as well as make vaginal phase of operation easier because of mobilization of uterus. We consider that laparoscopic-vaginal radical hysterectomy could be a valuable element in broadening the spectrum of many kinds of operations used in treatment of cervical cancer.","title":"[Laparoscopic-vaginal radical hysterectomy in surgical treatment of cervical cancer].","pubmedId":"12931465"}
