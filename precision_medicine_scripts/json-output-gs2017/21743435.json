Single-punch (n\u003d1280; cohort 1) and multiple-punch (n\u003d195; cohort 2) tissue microarrays were used for dual-labelling fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Amplification was defined as a ratio \u003e2 times for 6p12/centromere 6 signals. Mutation analysis of KRAS (codons 12 and 13) and BRAF (codon V600E) and immunohistochemistry for p-MAPK3/MAPK1, PEBP1, HMMR, p-AKT, PLAU, PLAUR, TP53 and VEGFA were performed on cohort 1. In cohort 1, VEGFA amplification was found in 39/1280 (3%) cases and linked to higher pT stage (P\u003d0.022), higher tumor grade (P\u003d0.024) and vascular invasion (P\u003d0.003). The 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 31% (95% CI 17-46) and 57% (95% CI 54-60) for amplified and nonamplified cases, respectively (P\u003c0.001). Results were confirmed in cohort 2. In multivariable analysis, the relative risk for amplification was 2.09 (95% CI 1.4-3.1; P\u003c0.001) and linked to more frequent BRAF mutation (P\u003d0.015), overexpression of p-MAPK3/MAPK1 (P\u003d0.012) and PLAU (P\u003d0.048) and loss of metastasis suppressor protein PEBP1 (P\u003d0.047). VEGFA gene locus amplification highlights a small but remarkably aggressive subgroup of colorectal cancers. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential role of amplification as a prognostic or predictive biomarker in both metastatic and nonmetastatic patients.","title":"VEGFA gene locus (6p12) amplification identifies a small but highly aggressive subgroup of colorectal cancer [corrected] patients.","pubmedId":"21743435"}
