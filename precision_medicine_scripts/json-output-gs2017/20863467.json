Detection of apoptosis of lung cancer cells might be helpful to predict prognosis and guide the postoperative treatment in patients with lung cancer.","title":"[A study on the relationship between lung cancer cell apoptosis and prognosis in patients with human non-small cell lung cancer.].","pubmedId":"20863467"}
