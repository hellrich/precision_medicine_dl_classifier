Although SpyGlass single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC) appears effective in diagnostics of indeterminate biliary strictures, there are only few studies on its safety in PSC-related strictures.\nThe aim of this study was to assess the clinical feasibility of SOC and directed biopsies, flow cytometry, and brush cytology in PSC patients.\nEleven consecutive patients (median age 45 years, 5 females) undergoing SOC for progression of PSC in a single tertiary center were included in a prospective observational study.\nBrush sample and directed biopsies were successfully acquired from strictures in all cases. Samples were adequate for cytological and histological diagnosis in 9 (82%) and 10 patients (91%), respectively. There were two cases of pancreatitis. In one patient, flow cytometry showed aneuploidy, which resulted in closer follow-up.\nSpyGlass SOC and directed biopsies seem to offer a feasible and promising method in evaluation of PSC-related strictures. However, the long-term prognostic value it adds to cytology and flow cytometry remains to be assessed in future trials.","title":"Spyglass single-operator peroral cholangioscopy seems promising in the evaluation of primary sclerosing cholangitis-related biliary strictures.","pubmedId":"25259419"}
