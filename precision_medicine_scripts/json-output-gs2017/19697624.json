The aim of the present study was to analyze the expression of the ERBB2 (HER2) protein in uterine sarcomas, in order to investigate the possibility of applying this treatment modality in uterine sarcomas.\nThe expression of ERBB2 has been analyzed immunohistochemically in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary uterine sarcomas (n \u003d 11).\nUsing a semi-quantitative immunohistochemical score, we found that ERBB2 expression was very weak in the majority of tumors, with only three sarcomas showing moderate ERBB2 expression. Published studies evaluating the same issue in small numbers of uterine sarcomas reached similar findings.\nOverall, ERBB2 expression appears to be weak in uterine sarcomas. However, targeted treatment might still be feasible in a subgroup of patients with uterine sarcomas overexpressing ERBB2.","title":"ERBB2 (HER2) protein expression in uterine sarcomas.","pubmedId":"19697624"}
