We report the case of a 58 year-old male patient presenting with a huge and painless mass of the left fossa ischiorectalis. Preoperative tests and CT-scan of the pelvis evoked the diagnosis of liposarcoma, laminating and lifting the rectum and bladder. Visceral walls were respected. The patient underwent a en-bloc excision of the tumour by a combined perineal and abdominal route. Pathological examination of the mass (1.7 kg) confirmed the diagnosis of well differentiated liposarcoma. No further treatment was initiated, but, because of the high risk of local recurrence, the patient has been placed under a close follow-up schedule.","title":"[Liposarcoma of the ischiorectal fossa, an unusual tumoral site].","pubmedId":"3176792"}
